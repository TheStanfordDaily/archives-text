# ARRANGEMENTS FOR RUGBY SERIES MADE
## 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
for the playing of the first of the series
of three rugby games between Stanford
and California next Saturday on Cali
fornia Field. The place of playing the
first game was undecided until Coach
Harry Maloney went to Berkeley yes
terday and brought back word that the
two rival fifteens would clash on the
other side of the bay.
The Cardinal squad is improving
rapidly as the rough edges are being
worked off. With Patrick, Hazeltine
and Kirksey working together in the
backfield, and the forwards rounding
into top form, things are looking better
for a Stanford day in Berkeley next
Saturday.
The Stanford ruggers are particularly
anxious to win the series against Cali
fornia, for the majority of the men who
will compose the rugby team to invade
Canada during the Christmas vacation
will no doubt be chosen from the ranks
of the winning team between Stanford
and U. C.
The second game of the series will
be played on the Stanford Turf Decem
ber 11.
