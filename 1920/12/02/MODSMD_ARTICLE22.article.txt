# Sixty Freshmen Sign Up For Preliminary Basketball Practice
## 
### 
About sixty freshmen have turned
out for the opening of the basketball
season this year. Most of these men
have had previous experience on high
school teams and although it is too
early in the season to tell what kind
of a team will be produced Coach
Seay seems to have some pretty fair
material to start with. Owing to the
lack of court space the men are re
quired to practice from 7 to 8 at night.
This is in many respects a handicap
but the willingness of the players has
been shown by the large turn out.
Coach Seay requests that all men that
can play the game report to him for
practice. He stated that the squad
would not be cut until next quarter
when specialization will begin. All
new men will be given a fair chance
to make the team and it is not too late
to sign up for the sport.
