# DOROTHY JOHNSTON GIVES REPORT OF WOMEN'S CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Dorothy Johnston, '21, president of
organized women, who was the Stan
ford delegates to the three-day confer
ence of university women representa
tives held recently at Washington State
University, last night presented her re
port of the conference at a meeting of
Women's Conference in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Sincerity of interest in university
affairs and a desire to have women entei
all forms of activities were the prin
cipal ideas emphasized in the confer
ence, Miss Johnston said. The confer
ence was attended by representatives
from all the universities and normal
schools on the Pacific Coast, and was
for the purpose of exchanging ideas and
views on matters of interest to univer
sity women. This was the first confer
ence of its kind to be held in the West.
The conference regulations of other
universities are in most cases much more
strict than they are here, Miss Johnston
said. Many universities have adopted
regulations which limit all social activi
ties to week-ends only, and all dances
stop at 11:30. The honor point system
was one of the leading subjects of dis
cussion.
Miss Kellam of the University of
Washington stated that the honor point
system had been in effect at the univer
sity for four years.
in the beginning, a junior girl was
appointed to find out what different
women students on the campus were
doing in student work and activities.
Committees worked under her who went
around to the presidents of all organiza
tions on the campus and inquired about
students of those organizations. Stu
dents are checked on the number of
hours they are carrying in connection
with their activities. Ten sub-chairmen
were appointed under Women's League
to check on all members of committees
of different organizations on the campus.
A card catalogue was made containing
names of all girls, together with their
addresses, grades, and course. All girls
must have grades of at least "C phis"
to take part in activities. The aim is to
keep grades up to "B."
Each activity counted so many points
and the number of points which any
student may have was limited, in com
parison with the student work they are
carrying. In this way, girls who have
already made a name on the campui
are prevented from taking all the other
honors. /
The subject of student control was
discussed from all pomts of view, since
equality of opportuniâ„¢ for the institu
tions represented was a governing idea
in the plan of the conference from the
program to the least detail in the ar
rangements. In the thought that surely
not by students alone will campus prob
lems be solved, faculty representatlvss
were to share the privileges of the floor,
and a faculty hour was a feature of each
day's program.
The representative of the Montana
State College discussed "Dissemination
of Campus Information." The subject
was considered from the two standpoints
of within the campus and without.
The different methods used for dis
semination of information are bulletin
boards, school paper, student body meet
ings, different organization meetings,
year books, hand books, etc. As yet
there has been comparatively little done
in dissemination of information from
one institution to another. She expressed
the great need of a plan for carrying
publicity from one campus to another. j
A system of exchange of news con
nected with women's activities as well
as all pamphlets and bulleins issued
by the women students was organized at
the confcrcnce and the university at
which the conference meets will act as
the exchange bureau for all the mem
bers of the conference.
One hour each week was given to a
discussion of which the delegates
which to bring up. Women's League
meetings, senior privileges and senior
control were discussed.
