# Mock Court Imposes Severe Sentence On Euphronia Defendant
## 
### 
"Judge" H. W. Patterson last night
sentenced the defendant In the Eu
phronia mock trial, to one of the
severest punishments ever known in
the history of society. To eat three
meals a day for live days each week
during two terms of six months at the
Stanford Inn was the sentence.
Regular court proceeding was fol
lowed. The attorney for the defense
was fined a box of apples for contempt
of court. "Attorney" Smith of the
prosecution featured a heart-rending
plea, bringing tears to the eyes of
the jury which totally upset "At
torney" Coblentz' ease, and secured
the verdict of guilty for the society.
