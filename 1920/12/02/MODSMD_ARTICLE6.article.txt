# COTILLION 10 HAVE RUSTIC ATMOSPHERE
## Every Feature to be Worked Out to Present Appearance of Mountain Hunting Lodge 
### S. H. WINKLEBLECK, '23 
If you have ever visited a well-kept
hunting lodge on a winter's evening
you can imagine the atmosphere which
the decorations for the Sophomore Co
tillion are expected to emulate. The
huge fireplace with its glowing logs as
it stands out in any hunting lodge will
be one of the main factors of the ar
rangements at the cotillion. Numerous
skins, Navajo rugs and hunters' outfits
will aid in beautifying the walls of the
hall.
In decorating for dances, in produc l
ing plays, lighting effccts seem to be the
foundation of success. Tomorrow night
illumination will come from old rustic
lamps and lanterns suspended from the
ceiling.
To execute this plan of pretentious
decorating a framework has to be con
structe'd. This framework will be set
up inside of the gymasium, and to it
numerous pieces of bark, representing
logs, will be' fastened. The ceiling will
be covered with burlap and the upper
portions of the walls with rustic brown
colored cardboard.
Much work is needed to put every
thing in readiness for the formal tomor
row night. The members of the sopho
more class started their labors this
afternoon and will continue until late
tonight. Every sophomore who has a
vacant period tomorrow is requested to
report to the gymnasium and lend a
hand to make "the first appearance of
the 1923 class in campus society" a suc
cess.
The programs which were distributed
at the Bookstore today are designed in
keeping with the decorations. The cover
is made of redwood shingles and is in
the form of a log cabin door. There
will be sixteen dances, and between the
eighth and ninth dinner will be served.
The interior of the programs bear the
names of the patrons and patronesses,
who are: President and Mrs. Wilbur,
Professor and Mrs. William Owens,
Dean and Mrs. Culver, Dean of Wdmeu
Harriet Bradford, Mr. and Mrs. Almon
E. Roth, Walter Powell and Mr. and
Mrs. Duffy Seay.
Another distinguishing feature of the
programs is that each dance is named
by some "backwoods" or "mountaineer"
name.
Tickets for the cotillion will be on
sale at the Bookstore up to the time of
closing Friday afternoon.
The dance committee has announced
that no ladies wearing flowers will be
admitted, and no couple will be ad
mitted unless the gentleman is holding
his ticket.
