# PRESIDENT WILBUR TALKS ON MEDICINE
## 
### 
Tracing the history of medical science,
President Wilbur, in addressing the
World Problems Forum in the Little
Theater yesterday evening, pointed out
the contributions medicine had made tj
human progress.
The beginnings of medical prevention
of disease may be traced in the efforts of
the Jews to obviate contagious diseases
by their precautions to insure cleanli
ness. The Greeks contributed super
stitions largely, which had little value.
Like the Romans, the Greeks applied
their medical theory only for the benefit
of the rich classes.
During the Middle Ages a develop
ment of ideas regarding the treating of
diseases took place, but few contribu
tions were made to constructive medi
cine and surgery.
The last hundred years has witnessed
the real development of medical science,
declared Dr. Wilbur. The modern un
derstanding of the germ theory has
made possible the cure of many dis
eases. The organic chemist and sani
tary engineer have made such progress
in applyin gtheir theories that we now
have under control the great depleting
diseases. It is safe to conclude that the
science has developed to such an extent
that the medical profession can keep
the large urban centers in good health.
