# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM IS READY FOR U.C. GAME
## Result Will Decide Leadership of League; Frosh Teams to Meet in Preliminary 
### 
Eager to keep up the clean record of
a season that has so far been without
a single defeat, Stanford's varsity soccer
team will play California tomorrow
afternoon on the local turf in the second
of a two-game series. Captain Newland
and his men are all on their toes and are
ready to make the hard fight that will
be necessary to whip the Blue and Gold.
A close analysis of the available dope
shows that on paper Stanford has the
stronger team and should win. This
will undoubtedly be the case if the team
shows its best combination work, as i.
was lack of this, especially in the for
ward line, that caused the game on No
vember 20 to end in a tie. California
has a strong team and one to be re
spected, but to all appearances Coach
Maloney lias developed a superior team.
In the last game the Cardinal back
field outplayed that of California, but
the work of the forwards did not meas
ure tip to the opposing line. Shifts have
been made in the Stanford forward line
since that time, afid the teamwork has
improved considerably. The fact that a
turf instead of an adobe field will be
available is expected to help. At least,
it will assure a good fast game, one
quite worth while to watch.
This game is the last game that will
be played with California this season
unless the two teams come out in a tie
for the league championship and a play
off game becomes necessary. But Stan
ford lias still several games on the
schedule with other teams of the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League, which
the Cardinal team now leads.
One important result of the game to
morrow is the fact that from the show
ing the players of both teams make, the
selections for the joint|team to play in
British Columbia will be chosen. A team
made up of the best men from the Stan
ford and California varsities will make
an invasion of British Columbia during
Christmas vacation to match their skiu
with the British soccerites.
Three last-minute changes have been
made in the lineup. Captain Newland
will play goal in place of Masters;
Strauss will hold down center forward
in place of Newland. find Clark will be
at outside left in place of Strauss.
Otherwise the lineup is unchanged from
that announced yesterday.
The freshman game will start
promptly at 1:30 and the Cardinal Baiter
have a good chance to win. At any
even the signs all point to a close cen
test, and the recent practice has brought
many changes in the lineup, both in
respect to the positions of the men who
played the last game and the introduc
tion of new material, which Coach Ma
loney feels confident will produce a
much more formidable team than the
previous one and which will make the
Bruin Cubs step to make a showing.
The varsity game will begin promptly
at 3:15.
The lineup follows:
Varsity—Newland (captain), goal;
Adams, right back; Anderson, left back;
Wing, right half; Robinson, center half;
Gorman, left half; Mendosa, outsiue
right; Campbell, inside right; Strauss,
center forward; Peavy, inside left;
Clark, outside left.
Freshmen —Genereaux, goal; Jordan,
right back: Smith, left back; Wilbur,
right half; Todd (captain), center half,
Sanders, left half; Phelps, outside right;
Swayne, inside right; Elmore,; center
forward; Mencees, inside left; Bussy,

field outplayed that of California, but
the work of the forwards did not meas
ure tip to the opposing line. Shifts have
been made in the Stanford forward line
since that time, afid the teamwork has
improved considerably. The fact that a
turf instead of an adobe field will be
available is expected to help. At least,
it will assure a good fast game, one
quite worth while to watch.
This game is the last game that will
be played with California this season
unless the two teams come out in a tie
for the league championship and a play
off game becomes necessary. But Stan
ford lias still several games on the
schedule with other teams of the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League, which
the Cardinal team now leads.
One important result of the game to
morrow is the fact that from the show
ing the players of both teams make, the
selections for the joint|team to play in
British Columbia will be chosen. A team
made up of the best men from the Stan
ford and California varsities will make
an invasion of British Columbia during
Christmas vacation to match their skiu
with the British soccerites.
Three last-minute changes have been
made in the lineup. Captain Newland
will play goal in place of Masters;
Strauss will hold down center forward
in place of Newland. find Clark will be
at outside left in place of Strauss.
Otherwise the lineup is unchanged from
that announced yesterday.
The freshman game will start
promptly at 1:30 and the Cardinal Baiter
have a good chance to win. At any
even the signs all point to a close cen
test, and the recent practice has brought
many changes in the lineup, both in
respect to the positions of the men who
played the last game and the introduc
tion of new material, which Coach Ma
loney feels confident will produce a
much more formidable team than the
previous one and which will make the
Bruin Cubs step to make a showing.
The varsity game will begin promptly
at 3:15.
The lineup follows:
Varsity—Newland (captain), goal;
Adams, right back; Anderson, left back;
Wing, right half; Robinson, center half;
Gorman, left half; Mendosa, outsiue
right; Campbell, inside right; Strauss,
center forward; Peavy, inside left;
Clark, outside left.
Freshmen —Genereaux, goal; Jordan,
right back: Smith, left back; Wilbur,
right half; Todd (captain), center half,
Sanders, left half; Phelps, outside right;
Swayne, inside right; Elmore,; center
forward; Mencees, inside left; Bussy,
outside left.
Eager to keep up the clean record of
a season that has so far been without
a single defeat, Stanford's varsity soccer
team will play California tomorrow
afternoon on the local turf in the second
of a two-game series. Captain Newland
and his men are all on their toes and are
ready to make the hard fight that will
be necessary to whip the Blue and Gold.
A close analysis of the available dope
shows that on paper Stanford has the
stronger team and should win. This
will undoubtedly be the case if the team
shows its best combination work, as i.
was lack of this, especially in the for
ward line, that caused the game on No
vember 20 to end in a tie. California
has a strong team and one to be re
spected, but to all appearances Coach
Maloney lias developed a superior team.

field outplayed that of California, but
