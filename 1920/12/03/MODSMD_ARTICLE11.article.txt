# SOPHOMORE COMEDY TO BE STAGED TOMORROW
## Clever Character Parts to be Success of Play 
### (By S. H. Winktebleck, '23 
"Jesus Loves Me, Yes, I Know," is
the opening hymn to Salisbury Field's
sensational comedy, "Wedding Bells," to
lie produced by the Sophomore class to
morrow night in the Assembly Hall.
The song is a solo and sung by Arnold
Bayley, who cleverly handles the part
of a Jap, Fuzisake. The curtain will rise
promptly at 8:15.
Fuzisake is a second boy in the home
of Reggie. He has been recently bap
tized into the Baptist Church and seems
to be chucked to the brim and bursting
out at the sides with religion. The part
calls for exceptional character work and
Bayley seems to be able to put the fin
ishing torches on Jap dialect.
The'cast of the play is made up wholly
of debutantes into campus dramatics.
Miss Cameron, who is taking the main
lead, appears in the role of Rosalie, a
young miss so chic and charming that
no one can blame Reggie'for what hap
pens later.
The second lead among the women is
the part of Miss Pixley. Her role, that
of Marcia, is well explained by the
words of Spenser, one of her admirers:
"Like a kitten that purs and scratches
around." The character work of this

part calls for a quick transformation
from a sweet nature when things are
coming her way to a catish disposition
when she meets with the least adversity.
Marcia's mother, Mrs. Hunter, is a
sentimental, gushy and rather old-fash
ioned lady of about 55 years. This role
is carried by Agusta Corey. Regardless
of her age, the elderly lady finds time to
flirt with Spencer Wells.
The comic part among the women is
taken by lvo Copeland. Mrs. Hooper is
a rosy-cheeked, good-natured English
woman of about 28 years, neatly dressed
in black with a cockney accent.
Among the men the heavy lead, or the
part of Reggie, a millonaire bachelor in
the eyes of his new affinity, is carried
by Dean Ross. He has in his house
hold a butler, known as Jackson, and an
ideal English servant. Hollis Chalmers,
a recent transfer from the University of
Utah, takes this role. He helps to bring
success to the play by his "butleristic'
attitude and his wandering eyebrow.
Spencer Wells, the character part
handled by Fred Hughes, is one of a
gay, irresponsible youth, decidedly Eng
lish in manner and appearance. Spencer
always finds time to test the good nature
of Reggie. Richard Malaby hinds his
place on the cast as Poet Douglas, a
dark, pale youth with burning eyes and
no sense of humor.
With the; above characters, Fields has
composed one of the most popular
comedies of the twentieth century. His
plot is entangled among vast complica
tions of engagements and marriages.
Every character has a desire to marry.
Even Fuzisake, whose soul seems to be
filled only with religion, finds a vacant
spot to equeeze in a little love.
Tickets will be sold at the box office
tomorrow night.
After the show the class will -give
a dance at the Women's Clubhouse.
This will be the last event of "Sopho
more week-end."


,t the eleventh hour the tables turn in the sparkling comedy "Wedding
Bells," and love's complications are unraveled.

always finds time to test the good nature
of Reggie. Richard Malaby hinds his
place on the cast as Poet Douglas, a
dark, pale youth with burning eyes and
no sense of humor.
With the; above characters, Fields has
composed one of the most popular
comedies of the twentieth century. His
plot is entangled among vast complica
tions of engagements and marriages.
Every character has a desire to marry.
Even Fuzisake, whose soul seems to be
filled only with religion, finds a vacant
spot to equeeze in a little love.
Tickets will be sold at the box office
tomorrow night.
After the show the class will -give
a dance at the Women's Clubhouse.
This will be the last event of "Sopho
more week-end."


,t the eleventh hour the tables turn in the sparkling comedy "Wedding
Bells," and love's complications are unraveled.
"Jesus Loves Me, Yes, I Know," is
the opening hymn to Salisbury Field's
sensational comedy, "Wedding Bells," to
lie produced by the Sophomore class to
morrow night in the Assembly Hall.
The song is a solo and sung by Arnold
Bayley, who cleverly handles the part
of a Jap, Fuzisake. The curtain will rise
promptly at 8:15.
Fuzisake is a second boy in the home
of Reggie. He has been recently bap
tized into the Baptist Church and seems
to be chucked to the brim and bursting
out at the sides with religion. The part
calls for exceptional character work and
Bayley seems to be able to put the fin
ishing torches on Jap dialect.
The'cast of the play is made up wholly
of debutantes into campus dramatics.
Miss Cameron, who is taking the main
lead, appears in the role of Rosalie, a
young miss so chic and charming that
no one can blame Reggie'for what hap
pens later.
The second lead among the women is
the part of Miss Pixley. Her role, that
of Marcia, is well explained by the
words of Spenser, one of her admirers:
"Like a kitten that purs and scratches
around." The character work of this

part calls for a quick transformation
from a sweet nature when things are
coming her way to a catish disposition
when she meets with the least adversity.
Marcia's mother, Mrs. Hunter, is a
sentimental, gushy and rather old-fash
ioned lady of about 55 years. This role
is carried by Agusta Corey. Regardless
of her age, the elderly lady finds time to
flirt with Spencer Wells.
The comic part among the women is
taken by lvo Copeland. Mrs. Hooper is
a rosy-cheeked, good-natured English
woman of about 28 years, neatly dressed
in black with a cockney accent.
Among the men the heavy lead, or the
part of Reggie, a millonaire bachelor in
the eyes of his new affinity, is carried
by Dean Ross. He has in his house
hold a butler, known as Jackson, and an
ideal English servant. Hollis Chalmers,
a recent transfer from the University of
Utah, takes this role. He helps to bring
success to the play by his "butleristic'
attitude and his wandering eyebrow.
Spencer Wells, the character part
handled by Fred Hughes, is one of a
gay, irresponsible youth, decidedly Eng
lish in manner and appearance. Spencer
always finds time to test the good nature
of Reggie. Richard Malaby hinds his
place on the cast as Poet Douglas, a
