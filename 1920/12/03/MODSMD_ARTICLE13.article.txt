# 1923 COTILLION WILL HOLD SWAY TONIGHT
## 
### 
The Annual Sophomore Cotillion
will hold full sway of campus activi
ties tonight. The first dance will start
promptly at 9 o'clock and the music
will he furnished by the Phi Psi or
chestra and several other campus mu
sicians.
The final touches to putting the de
corations in shape were finished late
this afternoon. Some changes in the
frame work which was made to sup
port the burlap and cardboard caused
delay in the completion of the deco
rations.
