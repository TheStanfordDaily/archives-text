# THE
						ATHLETIC PROGRAM
## 
### 
With the announcement of the plans for the erection of the Stan
ford Bowl, this University, through the Board of Athletic Control, has
entered on an extensive athletic program. The Stanford Bowl, the
basketball pavilion, and the tennis courts are the big athletic features
that the Board is attempting. The total cost of this construction pro
gram will be $828,000.'
Work on the basketball pavilion will begin immediately, and it will
be ready for the Senior Ball late in the spring quarter. The pavilion
will seat approximately 3,500 people, and will contain a spring basket
ball floor. Room will be provided for handball courts. The structure
will cost approximately $75,000, and is to be paid for largely by the
students in a form of a tax.
The Stanford Bowl, which was announced yesterday, will be ready
for the Big Game in 1923. It is to be built at an estimated cost of
$750,000 and will have a minimum seating capacity of 60,000. It will
contain playing space enough for both American and rugby football,
and a 220-yard straightaway running track. A baseball diamond may
be included. Excavation will start this summer.
The Board is building at the present time twenty new tennis courts,
two of which will be ready for use in two weeks. The courts are being
built out of oil and sand, at an estimated cost of $3,000. When all of
the courts are completed, Stanford tennis facilities will be the equal of
most tennis clubs.
The Board of Athletic Control has entered on an extensive pro
gram, and when it is completed, Stanford's equipment for inter-collegi
ate and intra-mural athletics will surpass that of the majority of uni
versities. The program entails considerable expense, and much of the
money is yet to be raised. However, the construction of all three proj
ects is assured, and that is the important fact for Stanford people to
bear in mind.
