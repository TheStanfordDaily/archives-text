Chairman of the Faculty Committee

largely responsible for the birth and
development of clean athletics and
the spirit of good sportsmanship at
Stanford. Dr. Angell came to Stan
ford in 1892, one year after the found
ing of the University and it wa3
through his untiring efforts that a
keen interest in athletics was created
both among the students and the
members of the faculty.
Frank Angell was born at South
Scituate, Rhode Island, on July 8,
1857. He received his elementary
education in a private school near
Scituate and later entered the Uni
versity of Vermont. In 1878 he re
ceived a degree of Bachelor of Science

to 1887 was a teacher in a high school
in Washington, D. C. He resumed

baseball team during his college
career, has been a participant in, as
well as the godfather of, Stanford ath
letics. For twelve years he was
captain of the faculty baseball team
and in the early days it took a good
set of varsity players to defeat the
faculty nine. Stanford has an envi
able reputation for clean athletics and
good sportsmanship and it is due, to
a great extent to the work of Dr.
Angell. He instilled the spirit into
Stanford men, not \Jjy preaching but
by suggestions and advice tendered
through personal associations with
teams. He went out on the field and
played with them and he held special
evenings at home when the students
could drop in to chat about the sea
son's prospects. On November 12,
1908, the students in appreciation of
the work of Dr. Angell presented him
with a silver box bearing the inscrip
tion, "In Recognition of Sixteen Years
of Devotion to the Cause of University
Athletics."
In 1916 Dr. Angell answered the call
of Herbert Hoover for trained men
to aid in relief work in Europe and
left Stanford to serve on the Commit
tee for Relief in Belgium. He was
absent from the University for eight
months which he spent traveling with
the other members of Hoover's com
mittee throughout Belgium, to investi
gate conditions and consider means
of relief for that war-torn country.

came to Stanford in 1892 to take up
his work as professor of psychology.
Dr. Angell has been actively en
gaged in psychological research work
during his years at Stanford. He has
written a large number of articles
dealing with psychology which have
been printed in psychological publica
tions.

Dr. Angell, himself an athlete, hav
ing captained both a football and a
baseball team during his college
career, has been a participant in, as
well as the godfather of, Stanford ath
letics. For twelve years he was
captain of the faculty baseball team
and in the early days it took a good
set of varsity players to defeat the
faculty nine. Stanford has an envi
able reputation for clean athletics and
good sportsmanship and it is due, to
a great extent to the work of Dr.
Angell. He instilled the spirit into
Stanford men, not \Jjy preaching but
by suggestions and advice tendered
through personal associations with
teams. He went out on the field and
played with them and he held special
evenings at home when the students
could drop in to chat about the sea
son's prospects. On November 12,
1908, the students in appreciation of
the work of Dr. Angell presented him
with a silver box bearing the inscrip
tion, "In Recognition of Sixteen Years
of Devotion to the Cause of University
Athletics."
In 1916 Dr. Angell answered the call
of Herbert Hoover for trained men
to aid in relief work in Europe and
left Stanford to serve on the Commit
tee for Relief in Belgium. He was
absent from the University for eight
months which he spent traveling with
the other members of Hoover's com
mittee throughout Belgium, to investi
gate conditions and consider means
of relief for that war-torn country.

Stanford. Dr. Angell came to Stan

through his untiring efforts that a
keen interest in athletics was created
both among the students and the
members of the faculty.
