# ENGINEERING SOCIETY MEETS AT BIG SMOKER
## 
### 
According to "Dad" Marx, and he
ought to know, the annual Civil Engi
neering Society smoker, held last night
in the Faculty Clubhouse, was the best
one ever held by the society. Three
prominent '95 men returned to the cam
pus for the event and delivered several
good talks to the students. A five-piece
orchestra was present to furnish music
for the occasion and a fast boxing
match between Walter Bills, '21, and
John Lane, '23, helped to round out the
evening.
W. S. Kirkbride, '95, now an engineei
in the employ of the Southern Pacific
Company, spoke of his experiences since
leaving Stanford and delivered several
hunches to the engineers. Ed. Carpenter,
'95, and Shirley Baker, '95, partners in
a consulting practice, also spoke on prac
tical engineering.
Robert Ames, '17, the youngest alum
nus present, pleaded for a closer connec
tion between students and alumni.
The Engineering Society wishes to
express their thanks for the use of the
Faculty Clubhouse, which proved an ad
mirable place to hold a smoker. Intend
ing civil engineering majors yet in tne
lower division are urged to attend the
smokers of the society.
