# NESTORIA ADVOCATES AMENDMENT BALLOT
## 
### 
After a prolonged discussion during
which heated arguments were ex
changed, the affirmative finally won
over recalcitrant members and the
Nestoria Debating Society at a meet
ing held last night passed almost un
animously a resolution to present an
amendment for the cosideration of
students at the next general election.
The proposed amendment to the
constitution of the Associated Stu
dents provides that at a special as
sembly held before the February and
June elections any active member of
the student body may nominate a
candidate from the floor. Its backers
claim that thi amendment is ad
vantageous in that it does away with
the more cumbersome method now
used of written nominations which
must be published. It is expected to
greatly increase student interest in
the nominations.
A prominent member of the society
made the statement that Nestoria
has been asked to consider the amend
ment and if it thought it advisable to
place it before the students. Nestoria
is pushing the amendment only so far
as to get. it before the student body
where it may be voted upon. "We
feel that as soon as it is on the bal
lot it will be discussed pro and con
and that if it is a good measure that
it will pass without any trouble."
The petition which is being circu
lated in older to secure the necessary
fifty signatures is as follows:
"We, the undersigned .respectfully
petition that the following proposed
amendment to Article 5, Section 1 of
the constitution of the A. S. S. U.,
be placed upon the ballot for the con
sideration of members of the Student
Body, at the next general election:
"A Nominating Assembly for the
purpose of making nominations shall
be held at least three university days
before the February and June elec
tions, and shall be duly advertised for
one week. At this meeting candidates
for the various offices of the associa
tion may be placed in nomination from
the floor by any active member there
of."
This amendment repeals that section
of the constitution now providing foi
nomination hv individual petition.
