### HENRY L. FARRELL (United Press Staff Correspondent 
NEW YORK. Dec. 3.—After a famine
of championship bouts, New York is
about to be turned loose in a pasture
abounding with title engagements.
So far. Benny Leonard has been the
only champion to show himself around
New York since the Walker law became
effective. Wliilc liis title has been at
stake, it was in about as much danger
as Uncle Sam's pile in the mint. Leon
ard can't find an opponent worthy of
giving him more than a slight workout.
However, interesting activities are
brewing in the bantam and heavyweight
classes.
Jack Dempsey, king of the heavy
weights. who has not appeared in a real
engagement in New York since he won
the title, has been booked by Tex Rick
ard to go fifteen rounds with Bill Briyi
nan, the Chicago husky, on December 14.
Pete Herman, the bantam champ, has
also been pulled out of his shell for a
championship fight with Joe Lynch in
Madison Square Garden, December 21.
Jack Britton. the welter title holder,
and Lou Bogash will probably b:
matched.
Since the boxing commission lifted
the ban on heavyweight engagements
the rumors about a return bout be
tween Dempsey and Jess Willard have
been revived.
Rickard allows the belief to prevail
that lie has them matched, or will match
them, for fifteen rounds on St. Patrick's
Day.
Willard said here last spring that he
would be willing to do some more box
ing if he didn't have to train. Evidently
he has changed his mind. He'll need
some training for Dempsey.
