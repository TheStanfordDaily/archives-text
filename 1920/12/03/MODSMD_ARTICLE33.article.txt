SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Doc. 3.â€”"lt
must ho getting cold up north," said the
old Texan. "I noticed two street vio
linists and a pencil seller this noon as I
went to dinner."
Just as the rohiti is the harbinger of
spring to the winter-bored north, the
street beggar is the announcement to
the south that winter is raging in the
northland.

lingers to feature "Traumcrci," he
comes south. Some visit San Antonio;
others travel to New Orleans.
