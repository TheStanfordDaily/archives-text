# PAVILION PLANS ARE CONSIDERED
## Committee of Stanford Men Goes Over Plans For New Courts and Dance Floor 
### 
Architects plans for the basketball
pavilion to be erected on the campus
during the current college year were
gone over by a committee of Stan
ford men in San Francisco yesterday.
The new building will be construct
ed on the site nu\v partially occupied
by the Encina tennis courts between
Encina Hall and the Gymnasium. Its
entrance will eitli face the hall or
the power house, west of the gymnasi
um. Provision has been made in the
plans for two galleries, the upper bal
cony to be built as soon as the need
for a greater 'Beating capacity is felt.
The addition will seat between 1500
and 1700 people, bringing the total
capacity up to about 4500.
A cradle spring floor, such as was
planned in the early part of the sea
son for a temporary pavilion, will be
the feature of tlw new structure. It
is believed that the success of future
Stanford basketball teams depends
upon the biulding of such or a similar
type of floor. Although this year's
team will not be benefitted by the
pavilion, it will be ready in time for
the 1921 Senior Ball, and all succeed
ing campus activities.
The wert side of the building will
be of solid brick. This wall will be
plastered and provisions made for
handball courts. The structure will
be roofed with tile, but will have no
ceiling. An efficient window lighting
system and ample provision for ven
tilation insures the popularity of the
pavilion as a combination ballroom
and basketball court.
A fifteen foot runway will be con
structed between the north side of
the pavilion and the present boxing
room of the Encina Gymnasium, in
which the catering will be taken care
of. The boxing room will be divided
horizontally in order to provide a
place for a wrestling room in the
upper portion. ,
The ne wstructure will be available
to all student body rallies and social
functions of various kinds. It will
serve as a medium between the uses
to which the Assembly and the
Men's Union are put.
Construction of the pavilion will be
gin as soon as possible and will con
tinue through the college year till its
completion in the latter part of the
spring quarter.
