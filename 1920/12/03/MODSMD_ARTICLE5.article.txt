### United Press 
CUERO, Texas, Dec. 3.—lf you're
back in New York or Boston or Chi
cago—some place where the supply
of turkeys doesn't keep up with the
demand —
You'll probably eat a turkey Christ
mas driven or handled by Oscar Egg,
Cuero, Texas. Egg claims the world's
record for handling turkeys. He
claims to have handled or driven in
to town more than one hundred thou
sand turkeys in the last ten years
for the annual pro-holiday slaughter.
Cuero is the leading turkey town
of Texas and Texas is the largest
turkey producing state in the Union.
The Turkey Trot, held November 11,
this year, found 7,500 turkeys in town.
They wero paraded down Main Street
with Oscar Efcg in charge. Just as
soon as the parade was over, the
same proud turkeys were driven down
to the packers and King Turk was
Dead Turk.
"Turkeys are strange birds," Egg
said. "They'll hunt all afternoon for
a good place to roost in the trees and
when night falls, you'll find 'em roost
ing on the ground."
The 7.500 turkeys of the Cuero
Turkey Trot wero made to parade by
a simple contrivance. A corn planter
was driven about fifty feet ahead of
the leading turkeys, dropping corn.
The leaders gobbled up the grains and
the rest of the flock followed "just to
see what they could see," according
to Egg.
