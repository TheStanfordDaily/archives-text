# WINTER QOARTER WILL SEE GROUND BROKEN FOR BOWL
## Plans For Stadium Will Come Before Board of Athletic Control Monday at Meeting 
### 
Formal breaking of the site for the
new Stanford Bowl will be held in the
early part of the winter quarter under
the supervision of a committee to be
appointed by Student Body President
F. L. McElroy, '21. Provision will prob
ably be made for a student rally on the
site, at which time final plans for the
active part to be taken by the student
body in the raising of funds will be
discussed.
Possible means for raising the $750,-
000 necessary for the construction of the
new bowl will be submitted to the Board
of Athletic Control for discussion Mon
day night by Leland Cutler, '06. It is a
current belief among university authori
ties that the final system of financial
canvass chosen will be modeled after
that used by colleges situated in a com
paratively similar geographical posi
tion. It is definitely known that the
systems used by colleges located in busi
ness centers could not be successful
here, even if modified to a degree.
Neither is the Stanford Alumni ex
tensive enough to permit the use of the
system of canvass used by Yale.
Students will proUably not be asked
to contribute directly to the bowl funds,
but their cooperation will be essential
to the success of the project, according
to reports from the Board of Athletic
Control. Skull and Snakes Society has
taken the initiative in the matter and is
sufficiently organized to take an imme
diate active part in partially carrying
out the task assigned the student body.
Active excavation work will begin on
the bowl possibly in May, 1921, and not
later than June. In order to allow the
embankments to settle, activities will be
discontinued after all ground work is
done, until the summer quarter of 1922,
The bowl will be complete, in time for
the Big Game of 1923.
An Engineering Commission, compris
ing Professors W. F. Durand, C. D.
Marx, and C. B. Wing, of the Engineer
ing Departments, has submitted prelim
inary plans for the stadium, and has
been requested to prepare a more de
tailed draught for construction. In
view of the fact that the old wooden
bleachers have been more or less tem
porary, it is probable that the plans wili
provide for an all-concrete structure.
