# FRESHMEN SWAMP GYM IN BASKETBALL TURNOUT
## Fifty-two Men are Trying Out for 'Babe' Quintet; Members of 'Champs' Present 
### 
Eifty-two freshmen arc out now for
basketball and were working hard up to
last night, when the cotillion took their
floor and court away from them. Thcic
is such a wealth of material out fo*
the sport that Coach Duffy Seay has had
no chance to get a line as yet on any
individual stars. In fact, he says that
he has what seems to be a half dozen
well-formed teams at the present.
Never before has such interest been
shown in the sport as this fall, and men
are coming out for practice in the gym
nasium in crowds that can scarcely be
accommodated. or more intra
mural quintets have been practicing and
each one is made up for a considerable
part of freshmen.
Among the freshmen out for the
squad are several last year's prep school
basketball captains and at least one
member of the all-state five. They are
out to beat the record of the "last
years," and are putting everything be
hind the advice that Duffy Seay is in
stilling them with.
Graduate Manager Ed. Martin is
working on the game schedule for the
"Babes" now, arid will have it ready for
the public in a few days. He is getting
a large number of games this year with
off-campus organizations with the idea
of building up early the confidence that
the youngsters need. A game with Palo
Alto High will conic in the near futuic
and the freshmen will also meet the
military detachment. Games will be
played probably on Tuesday and Friday
nights each week and will keep the
"Babes" in trim and allow the whole
squad to tried out before the middle
of the season.
Early in next week the squad will be
divided into groups in order that the
coaches can get around to them and see
the work of the individuals on the court.
In this way there will be plenty of prac
tice and tlie men will get a chance to
show up against each other man that is
out for the same position.
