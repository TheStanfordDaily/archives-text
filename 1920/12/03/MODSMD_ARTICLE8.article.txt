# HEALY CONCERT IS TONIGHT IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Raoul Vidas, Violinist, and Charles Hackett, Tenor, to Give a Double Program 
### 
The program which Rauol Vidas
and Charles Hackett will present this
evening in the Assembly Hall, at 8:15,
in the opening concert of the Healy
series is not only comprehensive in
its variety but is also unusually large,
due to the fact that the two artists
will each present as many numbers as
he would give in single concert. This
arrangement is because of a mistake
made in the booking* of the two art
ists. Their appearance here and in
San Francisco will be the only times
the two artists will be heard in this
part of the country.
Raoul Vidas is considered a remark
able violinist, and Charles Hackett is
the American tenor who triumphed
notably at the La Scala in Milan,
coming directly to the Metropolitan
Opera House where he was enthusi
astically received. This evening's
program comprises selections from
both old and new masters, and in
cludes well-known operatic numbers
with compositions equally as interest
ing, so often heard.
Tonight's concert will be a double
concert in every sense of the word.
Each artist will give as much on this
occasion as he does at single recitals
and each artist will have his own ac
companist, Seneca Pierce being "at
the piano" for Hackett, and Sol Al
berti "at the piano" for Vidas.
In order than nothing will be left
undone to make a lasting impression
Mr. Vidas lias changed some of his
numbers. Instead of playing "Cha
conne" by J. M. Leclair, for his first
number he will play Folies d'Espagne
by Corelli. In addition to the num
bers on the printed program there
will be many encore numbers.
