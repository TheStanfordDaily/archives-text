# GOVERNMENT CAN NOT LEND AID TO FARMERS
## Secretary of Treasury Says Retail Prices Will Drop; No Contracting of Credit Here 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.â€”Govern
ment relief for present conditions con
fronting farmers is impossible, Secre
tary of the Treasury Houston todaj
told the House and Senate agricultural
committee. Houston was the first wit
ness today before the committee, which
is seeking relief for the farmers who
have been hit by the rapidly-falling
prices of their products. At the same
time, the secretary predicted a drop in
retail prices. He said retail dealers had
been holding out against lowering,
prices, but would not be able to do so
much longer.
"The nuich-talked-of deflation or con
traction of crcdit does not exist," said
Houston. "The only limitation put on
credit has been to close speculation."
Houston said that in his opinion there
was no way to finance agricultural ex
ports because of the financial situation
existing between Europe and the United
States.
"Europe now owes us about $14,000,-
000,000," said Houston. "Our export*
arc increasing annually, so that this year
they will total about $8,100,000,000. How
Europe can pay for the exports it is no*v
receiving or can take more from the
United States, I don't know."
