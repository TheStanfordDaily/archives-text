# "WEDDING BELLS" SECOND DRAMATIC SUCCESS OF YEAR
## Clever Plot is Well Handled by Every Member of Cast; Little Criticism is Deserved 
### Sam H. Winklebleck, '23 
"Wedding Bells," Salisbury Field's
sensational comedy of marriage en
tanglements, is the second dramatic suc
cess of this year's campus productions.
The play itself was modern and the
committee that chose it is entitled to
compliment for selecting a more sophis
ticated comedy than is usually produced
by college talent.
The cleverness of the plot and the
interwinding of complications was wch
handled by the members of the cast.
There was some criticism to be found,
but considering the fact that the play
was written for professional talent, call
ing for exceptional character work and
long dialogues, which are always the
greatest obstacles in the path of an ama
teur, the sophomore debutants did well.
Donaldinc Cameron in the lead, as
Rosalie, had a dash and vivacity 'of
manner, though her nervousness was evi
dent. Her type was somewhat of a
handicap to her in the first act, and
the ingenue role of the comedy seemed
to be more fitted to her. She showed
much improvement in the last two acts.
Her voca lexpressions and inflection >
were clear and distinct.
Dean Ross showed a good sustained
attitude in his role of Reginald Carter.
He was quite natural and his depres
sions were well marked by his facial
expressions. The part of Spencer Wells,
a jolly good irresponsible youth, was
carried by Fred Hughes. Hughes seemed
a bit conscious of the audience. He did
well, though, and depicted splendidly the
traits of the type of character his part
portrayed.
Florence Pixley as the ingenue, Marcia
Hunter, showed considerable poise and
was quite natural in the way she con
ducted her acting. She was clever in
her transformations from a sweet
natured young miss to a storming, calish
sort of a little "she-devil." Augusta
Corwy, who took the role of mother to
Marcia, can be criticised upon but one
thing, and that is she seemed to lack
maturity. Other than that she fitted in
exceptionally well with the other mem
bers of the cast.
Fuzisaki, the Jap part, was taken by
Arnold Bayley. Bayley showed marvel
ous talent. He spoke his dialect withou
breaks or changes in such manner that
it could 1)e understood clearly. In thÂ«i
role of Hooper, an English maid, which
calls for dialect, Ivo Copeland also
seemed to be miscast. She changed from
a cockney accent to somewhat of a Bow
ery talk.
Richard Malaby and Hollis Chalmers
both handled their characters without
fault. Malaby, in the part of Doug.as
Ordway, a poet with no sense of humoi,
put the finishing touches to the bur
lesque part. His gestures and vocal ex
pression gave exact meaning to his char
acter.
Chalmers readily assumed the "butlcr
istic" attitude of an English servant. He
was good in his dialcct, which had a
touch of English accent mixed with a
low drawl. The most outstanding tea
ture of his facial expressions was Ins
left eyebrow.
The setting for the play was worked
out to perfection. It depicted a scene
in a living room. The scenes were artis
tically painted and the color scheme was
good. Gowns worn by the leading ladies
were received from Livingston Brothers
of San Francisco and men's clothing
from Roos Brothers of Palo Alto.
