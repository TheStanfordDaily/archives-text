# CONGRESS MEETS TODAY; HARDING SETS PRECEDENT
## President-Elect Gives First Address Before U. S. Senate; Wilson Speaks Dec. 7 
### L. C. MARTIN (United Press Staff Correspondent 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 6—Presi
dent-elect Harding today addressed the
Senate as a member of that body,
setting a new precedent in American
history. He told his colleagues in a
brief talk that while always mindful
of the Senate's place and responsibili
ties in the government, he always will
remember and expects the Senate to
remember that he is president.
Harding expects co operation and de
clared that it was not necessary for
Congress or the executive to surrender
to the other. He also urged the Sen
ate to make the remaining three
months of the Wilson administration
a peaceful time.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 6—Presi
dent Wilson will address Congress in
writing according to members of the
Congressional Notification Committee
which called at the White House with
formal word that Congress had met.
Members took it to mean that the
President does not expect to appear
before Congress in person tomorrow.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.—The final
session of the Sixty-sixth Congress
began at noon today. When it ends on
March 3 next, many of the members
who today greeted each other will re
turn to private life along with Wood
row Wilson.
This short session has been looked
on in prospect as a rather routine
session, devoted largely to passage of
the fourteen appropriation bills. But
indications are that it will be crowded
with other important business. Not
only will the mass of routine be tre
mendous, but there is to be consider
able foundation-laying for the Sixty
seventh Congress, when the Republi
cans, in complete control of both
legislative and executive branches of
the government, purpose an ambitious
program.
When Congress assembled, interest
centered in President Wilson's final
message, which probably will he read
tomorrow. Both houses, but particu
larly the senate, wanted to hear wheth
er Wilson, defeated at the "solemn
referendum" on the league of nations
covenant at last month's election,
would indicate his intentions with re
gard to the treaty. It will make slight
difference what President Wilson sug
gests, however, as Republican plans
for handling the treaty are already
mapped out. The extra session next
March or April is to handle that, un
less the unexpected should happen,
and Wilson should send the treaty
back now, with an acceptance of Sen
ate reservations.
Here is some of the work which this
session will be called on to dispose
of:
Fourteen appropriation bills.
Reappointment, of representation in
the House of Representatives, based
no the 1920 census.
A national budget bill.
A bill to amend the Volstead pro
hibition enforcement law to make
prohibition less stringent.
A bill to make the Volstead law
more stringent, and to give tlie pro
hibition commissioner a bigger force,
more money and wider powers.
A demand for a sweeping investiga
tion of prohibition enforcement.
Some measures of tax revision, al
though the main program of tax and
tariff revision is to be undertaken at
the next session, according to pres
ent plans of Republican leaders.
A soldier bonus bill.
Measures to lower the cost of liv
ing. V
Proposed amendments of the rail
road law.
A treaty with Japan covering land
ownership by Japanese in California
and other states.
A treaty with Colombia, settling the
old controversy over the Panama
Canal and establishing American oil
interests in Colombia.
Measures to improve housing con
ditions.
Proposals to curb the power in grain
exchanges to control the price of
wheat and other grains.
A large number of welfare measures.
In addition, some new investigations
doubtless will be undertaken. The sen
ate campaign fund investigating com
mittee is expected to make a partial
report, and will also continue its in
quiry. Having asked how candidates
and parties raised the money, the
committee now will ask how they
spent it. A final report may also be
made on the Newberry election case.
