# CONGRESS MEETS TODAY; HARDING SETS PRECEDENT
## President-Elect Gives First Address Before U. S. Senate; Wilson Speaks Dec. 7 
### L. C. MARTIN (United Press Staff Correspondent 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 6—Presi
dent-elect Harding today addressed the
Senate as a member of that body,
setting a new precedent in American
history. He told his colleagues in a
brief talk that while always mindful
of the Senate's place and responsibili
ties in the government, he always will
remember and expects the Senate to
remember that he is president.
Harding expects co operation and de
clared that it was not necessary for
Congress or the executive to surrender
to the other. He also urged the Sen
ate to make the remaining three
months of the Wilson administration
a peaceful time.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 6—Presi
dent Wilson will address Congress in
writing according to members of the
Congressional Notification Committee
which called at the White House with
formal word that Congress had met.
Members took it to mean that the
President does not expect to appear
before Congress in person tomorrow.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.—The final
session of the Sixty-sixth Congress
began at noon today. When it ends on
March 3 next, many of the members
who today greeted each other will re
turn to private life along with Wood
row Wilson.
This short session has been looked
on in prospect as a rather routine
session, devoted largely to passage of
the fourteen appropriation bills. But
indications are that it will be crowded
with other important business. Not
only will the mass of routine be tre
mendous, but there is to be consider
able foundation-laying for the Sixty
seventh Congress, when the Republi
cans, in complete control of both
legislative and executive branches of
the government, purpose an ambitious
program.
When Congress assembled, interest
centered in President Wilson's final
message, which probably will he read
tomorrow. Both houses, but particu
larly the senate, wanted to hear wheth
er Wilson, defeated at the "solemn
referendum" on the league of nations
covenant at last month's election,
would indicate his intentions with re
gard to the treaty. It will make slight
difference what President Wilson sug
gests, however, as Republican plans
for handling the treaty are already
mapped out. The extra session next
March or April is to handle that, un
less the unexpected should happen,
and Wilson should send the treaty
back now, with an acceptance of Sen
ate reservations.
Here is some of the work which this
session will be called on to dispose
of:
Fourteen appropriation bills.
