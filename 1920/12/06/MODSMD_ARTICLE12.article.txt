# W. P. FULLER '10 WILL SPEAK ON POLAND THURSDAY
## Students Will Hear Stanford Man Tell of Relief Work at University Assembly 
### 
"A Year in Poland" will be the sub
ject of Palmer Fuller, '10, who will
address a University Assembly Thurs
day morning at 10 o'clock. Fuller was
connected with the American Relief
Administration work in that country
after the signing of the armistice. It is
said that he is a close observer and
gives an interesting picture of conditions
in Poland.
Fuller was well known at Stanford
in campus dramatics during his under
graduate days. He is also remembered
as a rugby official.
In the early days of the war Fuller
and his wife, who was Miss Adeline
Wright, a Stanford woman, were active
in the organization work of both the
Food and Fuel Administrations. Fuller
later went into the Naval Intelligence
Service, acting as a censor.
When this work came to an end with
the signing of the armistice Herbert
Hoover obtained him for the European
relief work, along with many other
men who were attached to various
branches of the service. He is head of
the W. P. Fuller Paint Company of San
Francisco.
