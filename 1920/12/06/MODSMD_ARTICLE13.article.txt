# ARTISTS WIN FAVOR IN DOUBLE PROGRAM
## Hackett and Vidas Exhibit Artistic Talent and Skill in the First Healy Concert 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Possessed of exceptional artistic feel
ing and skill which gained for them
immediate appreciation, Charles Hack
ett, Metropolitan tenor, and Raoul
Vidas, the young Rumanian violinist,
presented a comprehensive and most
satisfying program in the opening con
cert of the Healy scries in the Assembly
Hall Friday night. Throughout their
alternate appearances the two artists dis
played a blending of technical mastery
with true artistic insight, and the encores
following each group evidenced the sus
tained interest which followed the vir
tuosos through their program.
Charles Hackett possesses a voice re
markable in its clarity and range, cap
able of loud, brilliant crescendos and of
soft, delicate tones which are sustained
until they die away almost imperceptibly
at the close of a song. His dramatic
interpretation of the "Che Gelida Man
illa" from "La Boheme" emphasized the
mastery of power and flexibility as well
as the pleasing lighter qualities of his
voice. Another number which made a
lasting impression was Da Rosa's "Stai
Viceno," which was sung with remark
able versatility of expression. Chaus
son's "Les Papillons," and "Mandoline,"
by Szulc, were representative of Hack
ett's less formal and heavy style and
were delightful both in interpretation
and in composition.
Never lacking in his exceptional
musicianship, Raoul Vidas, the eighteen
year-old virtuoso, expressed a feeling of
true poetic sympathy with his work and
possesses the qualities of perfect ability
and mastery as well as the insight and
feeling which marks genuine talent. His
appreciation of the beautiful melodies in
the "Follies d-Espagne," by Correlli. the
opening number, was feelingly expressed
with marked artistry. The Saint-Saens
Concerto afforded opportunity for a
revelation of his abilities in a variety
of movements. Neither the pianissimo
themes nor the heavier passages were in
any way lacking in expression or qualit}
of" tone. The "Melodie Orientale"
seemed peculiarly suited to Vidas' inter
pretation. and lie played it with an ap
peal especially delightful. A "Danse
Vilageoise," by Dimitresco, was particu
lraly interesting in its color and imagery,
and the Pugnanni-Kreisler "Prelude
Allegro" was also fortunately chosen as
a medium for the expression of the
beautiful and more delicate qualities of
Vidas' playing.
