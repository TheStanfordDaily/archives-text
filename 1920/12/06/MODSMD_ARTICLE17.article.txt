# PLAY GAVE SETTINGS OF UNUSUAL QUALITY
## 
### 
The sophomore play staging showed
(lie successful result of hard work and
sincere effort. Not only was the acting
good, but a great deal of thought and
cleverness was put into scenic and light
ing effects. The drawing-room scctie
was exceedingly rich in setting and the
new picture frame did much to add to
its completeness. Under the new system
of the Dramatic Council, such improve
ments and changes are possible. Before
there was little stress laid on scenery
or spot-lighting, and consequently the
crudest results were obtained. Now,
however, they arc studied and considered
as important as the business of the play.
