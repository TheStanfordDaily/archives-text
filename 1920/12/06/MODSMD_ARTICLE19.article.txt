# VARSITY "S" RULES
## 
### 
Stanford still fails to have a definite set of rules for
awarding - athletic honors. There seems to be no definite
amount of games, or parts of a game in which a man has to
participate in to win his "S," or no definite rule governing
the style of varsity and freshman sweaters.
A definite set of laws governing the award of the varsity
"S" was drawn up last spring, and passed by the Executive
Committee. These rules were assumed by the student body
to be final, and the standard to which each candidate was to
conform to. But the rules have been changed several times
since, according to the wishes of the Executive Committee.
Such a practice is not fair to the students as a whole, and to
the athletes. A definite set of rules should be adopted and
published, and accepted as final. Proposed amendments should
be submitted to a student body election for ratification.
At present the varsity and freshman sweaters appear to
be the same to the outsider. There is a considerable distinc
tion between varsity and freshman teams, and the same dis
tinction should exist in the sweater award.
No doubt Skull and Snakes would be glad to assist the
Executive Committee in compiling a permanent set of rules.
