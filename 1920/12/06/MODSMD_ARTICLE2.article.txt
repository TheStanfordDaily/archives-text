# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM WINS FAST GAME FROM BEARS
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer varsity, playing a
fast and consistent game, sent Cali
fornia down to a 2 to 0 defeat Satur
day on the local turf, thereby winning
the series from the Blue and Gold, and
retaining hold cn first place in the
Soccer League. California battled
desperately up to the last minute, but
had no chance again the superior
teamwork and individual playing of
Stanford.
California sent down an even strong
er aggregation than that which held
the Cardinals to a tie on November
20, but the marked improvement in
the playing of the latter made Cali
fornia's increase in strength count for
nothing. Stanford's backfield played
a remarkable game, and although the
opposing team came dangerously near
the goal at times, especially on op
portunities offered by corner kicks,
the Cardinal goal proved too well
guarded. A marked improvement
could be noticed in the forward line,
and it was this improvement that
made possible the 'wo scores.
The game opened with both teams
showing about equal strength in the
first few minutes of play. California
made several rushes, however, that
proved dangerous, and but for the
alertness of Capt. Newland, playing
goal, would have scored at least one
and possibly two points. The Cali
fornia forward line seemed to be show
ing better teamwork at this time. To
wards the middle of the half, the
Cardinal machine got under way and
put the Blue nnd Gold on the de
fensive. Several snappy rushes were
staged, and when the California goal
keeper finally fumbled the ball, three
Stanford men were there to kick it,
Peavy's toe being the one that actu
ally made score.
Invasion of California's territory was
prevalent throughout the second half,
although the California players would
spurt every once in a while and come
dangerously near scoring. Corner
kicks helped them a good deal at this
stage of the game. Stanford's for
ward line gathered impetus near the
close of the game, and with good com
bination wrk. rushed the goal keeper
again and again until another fumble
on a shot by Peavy let the ball go in
for one more point, five minutes before
the close of play.
Analysis of the game shows that the
Stanford backfield is a truly remark
able combination, exhibiting along
with smooth teamwork the aggressive
kind of individual playing that is the
best brand possible for defending goal.
The forward line showed a decided im
provement in teamwork over the last
game. California showed a well
balanced fighting team; a strong team,
but not. strong enough to measure up
to Coach Maloney's machine.
The players who will travel to Brit
ish Columbia have not yet been pick
ed. Coach TVTaloney will meet the Cali
fornia coach on Thursday and with
him will select the men from the two
teams who will form the all-star ag
gregation to meet the Canadians dur
ing Christmas vacation.
