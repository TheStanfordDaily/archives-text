# PROFESSOR H. W. STUART IS FOUNDER OF PRESENT PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
Professor Stuart is the founder of the
present Stanford Philosophy Depart
ment. The first philosophy department
passed out of existenee in 1905. From
that time until Stuart was called from
Lake Forest College, in 1907, philosophy
was unknown to the Stanford student
body.
Henry Waldgrave Stuart was born in
Oakland, December 1, 1870. He spent
his boyhood there and entered the Uni
versity of California from Oakland High
School in 1889. He graduated from the
Berkeley institution with the degree of
Bachelor of Philosophy. Advanced study
at the University of Chicago netted him
his doctor's degree in 1900.
After graduating from college, Pro
fessor Stuart became a teacher in the
Hollister High School. In 1894 he en
tered the faculty of the University of
Chicago as a fellow in political economy.
His first real work as a college professor
was at the Washington University in St.
Louis as an instructor in the economics
department. He stayed in St. Louis until
1897. At this time he abandoned college
work and became a teacher in the Cen
tral School of Oakland until 1898, when
he was called to be principal of the
Woodland High School.
In 1900 he returned to the University
of Chicago as a fellow in the philosophy
department. At this time he took his
doctor's degree. The work at Chicago
wos followed by a short stay at Ripon
College as an instructor in economics
and history. Stuart began as an in
structor in philosophy at the State Uni
versity of lowa, which position he held
until 1904. In that year he became pro
fessor of philosophy at Lake Forest Col

lege, where he stayed until called to
found the pre>ent Stanford Philosophy
Department in 1907.
According to Professor Stuart, his
main distinction at California in under
graduate days was in military lines. In
his junior year he had the "honor" of
being the only second-class private in
the unit, who was an upperclassman.
This even continued into his senior year,
at which time he worked off previously
taken cuts. He became rather expert at
target practice, although he was handi
capped by having only one eye which
would serve him in this work, and that
a poor one.
Professor Stuart was associate editor
and founder of a magazine at California
known as "The Berkeleyan." This paper
flourished only a short time. He was
also connected in journalistic work as
associate editor of the "Blue and Gold"
in 1892.
Buying second-hand books, eating
peanuts and going to the movies to see
Charlie Chaplin constitute Professor
Stuart's main diversions from the
glamor of college life as a professor.
He has frequently gone to his home
town of Oakland with the avowed pur
pose of buying clothes and ended up by
spending all of his money on second
hand books. When the trips to Oakland
are not made in order to purchase such
necessities, Stuart drops in on his boy
hood chum and the afternoon is spent
eating peanuts at any movie in town
that happens to be showing a picture of
his favorite comedian.
Professor Stuart is a member of Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Beta Kappa and the
Western Association of Philosophers.

glamor of college life as a professor.
He has frequently gone to his home
town of Oakland with the avowed pur
pose of buying clothes and ended up by
spending all of his money on second
hand books. When the trips to Oakland
are not made in order to purchase such
necessities, Stuart drops in on his boy
hood chum and the afternoon is spent
eating peanuts at any movie in town
that happens to be showing a picture of
his favorite comedian.
Professor Stuart is a member of Phi
Delta Theta, Phi Beta Kappa and the
Western Association of Philosophers.
Professor Stuart is the founder of the
present Stanford Philosophy Depart
ment. The first philosophy department
passed out of existenee in 1905. From
that time until Stuart was called from
Lake Forest College, in 1907, philosophy
was unknown to the Stanford student
body.
Henry Waldgrave Stuart was born in
Oakland, December 1, 1870. He spent
his boyhood there and entered the Uni
versity of California from Oakland High
School in 1889. He graduated from the
Berkeley institution with the degree of
Bachelor of Philosophy. Advanced study
at the University of Chicago netted him
his doctor's degree in 1900.
After graduating from college, Pro
fessor Stuart became a teacher in the
Hollister High School. In 1894 he en
tered the faculty of the University of
Chicago as a fellow in political economy.
His first real work as a college professor
was at the Washington University in St.
Louis as an instructor in the economics
department. He stayed in St. Louis until
1897. At this time he abandoned college
work and became a teacher in the Cen
tral School of Oakland until 1898, when
he was called to be principal of the
Woodland High School.
In 1900 he returned to the University
of Chicago as a fellow in the philosophy
department. At this time he took his
doctor's degree. The work at Chicago
wos followed by a short stay at Ripon
College as an instructor in economics
and history. Stuart began as an in

versity of lowa, which position he held
until 1904. In that year he became pro
fessor of philosophy at Lake Forest Col

lege, where he stayed until called to
found the pre>ent Stanford Philosophy
Department in 1907.
According to Professor Stuart, his
main distinction at California in under
graduate days was in military lines. In
his junior year he had the "honor" of
being the only second-class private in
the unit, who was an upperclassman.
This even continued into his senior year,
at which time he worked off previously
taken cuts. He became rather expert at
target practice, although he was handi
capped by having only one eye which
would serve him in this work, and that
a poor one.
Professor Stuart was associate editor
and founder of a magazine at California
known as "The Berkeleyan." This paper
flourished only a short time. He was
also connected in journalistic work as
associate editor of the "Blue and Gold"
in 1892.
Buying second-hand books, eating
peanuts and going to the movies to see
Charlie Chaplin constitute Professor
Stuart's main diversions from the
glamor of college life as a professor.
