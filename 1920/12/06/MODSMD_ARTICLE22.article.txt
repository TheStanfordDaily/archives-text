Tearful and repentant the polvcrs that
zuas announce ye receivership of ye col
yum of "Cabbages and THINGS." The
autopsy shows demise of said colyum
attributable to malicious malnourish
mcnt. No more docs the welkin ring
with right hearty laughter as in the
days of rousing joke and brimming cup.
But on the wreck of the good ship
"Cabbage" it is hoped that the founda
tion of ''Retarded Sparks" will rest
firmly.
Not without the scope of possibili
ties a future page may be captioned
"Advanced Sparks," allowing time for
insiduous cultivation of public taste
to meet the demands of an advance
course in humor.
IVe learn that the responsibility of
nourishing "Cabbages" drove one editor
to consider a trip to Europe, and zinth
out an increase i nthc rate and nature
of contributions, his successor may suc
cumb to similar inclinations. Not that
we object to Europe (it is never July Ist
there), but itrith brevity there must be
zcit, and hence our colyum solicits'
patronage.
One of our readers, calmly perus
ing an agonizing pun, remarked with
sage conviction, "The worst., thing
that can happen to a joke is to get
it into the "Cabbage" colym. That's
all right Johnny, but slip us one like
onoe in a while (on some one else)
and our derided page may take on
new zest and flavor.
The colyum today is devoted largely
to discussion of the dying joke. Succor!
' for the love of mud, succor!
"We heard Willful Willie rcciting as
the paper went to sleep:
"And what's the Stanford Spirit?" Dad
A freshman asked of Jones.
"It's that which brings you back, my
lad,
Despite the sixty bones."

WHAT STOPPED HIM?
Co-ed stood on the corner;
And watched a passerby,
Who stood and looked at her—
the rough,
But wouldn't pass 'er by.

Levi Wiseguy bemoans the fact that
the source of 99 and 44/100% of our
effffusive campus wit will be lost if
the proposed dismantling of the Inn
is carried into effect. Now, the ques
tion before the house is; can we af
ford to sacrifice our wit to do away
with a trivial thing like indigestion?

HOW PAINFUL!
He caught her eye, he held her gaze;
He looked her through and through;
Then cut her with a nasty glance;
Page an M. D. or two.

Able Abe insists that they ought to
repeal the Volstead Act to put a new
kick in Prohibition humor. "Say, it'd
be a lot more fun laughin' then, than
it is tryin' to laugh now."

THE LATEST HOP
The prisoner sat within his cell;
Desiring consolation;
He grabbed a pen and wrote a bunch,
Of inside information.
Which calls for;
The coke fiend sat within his den;
The villain was past hope,
A copper chanced to get from him,
His only inside dope.
Which ends with;
The same bird lay with glazing eyes;
He admitted feeling punk;
When asked what he was lying on,
He said "Why that's the bunk."

Wily Wylle just dropped in to in
form ye ed, that there ought to be a
bounty on jokes. Maybe he's right—
but they ought to double it on joke
writers. This isn't an open season
on jokes, anyway.
"YO HO AND A BOTTLE—"
The city lad picked up the cup,
And after drinking fully,
Set it back upon the shelf
And said, "That milk tastes bully."
