# RUGGERS BATTLE THROUGH MUD IN SCORELESS GAME
## Two Rival Fifteens Will Meet Again Next Saturday for Second Contest of Series 
### 
Stanford and California rugby teams
played a 0 to 0 tie on California Field
last Saturday in the first of the seri
es of the games between the two
squads. The muddy condition of the
lield slowed the game up considerably,
and prevented the Cardinal backfield
from showing to its best advantage.
The Stanford forwards.had a slight
shade over their opponents. Several
times after the California backfield
had rushed the ball to within a few
feet of the goal line, the Cardinal pack
held, and then carried the ball back
out of danger.
California made its most dangerous
bid for a score early in the first half.
In the first few minutes of play the
Blue and Gold backfield carried the
ball to the Stanford 1-yard line. The
ball was put in the scrum there, and
the Stanford forwards carried it to
the twenty-yard line. Kirksey made
a long run during the first half but
slipped in the mud in attempting to
swerve past the tackier, and was
downed.
Stanford will meet California on the
Stanford turf next Saturday, to play
off the tie of last Saturday.
The Cardinal fifteen will observe
strict training rules this week in order
to be in the best possible condition
for the second game of the series.
The Stanford team lined up Satur
day as follows: â€”Sherman, wing for
ward; Tritle and Campbell, front
rank; Clark, lock; Loder and Farish.
break-aways; Hole and James, rear
rank; Lynn, half back; Hazeltine,

eights; Kelly, center three-quarters;
Murray and Rogers, wings; Dwiglit,
