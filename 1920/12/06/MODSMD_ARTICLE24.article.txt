# TRYOUTS WEDNESDAY FOR MASQUERS' PLAY
## 
### 
Preliminary try-outs for the Masqu
ers' play to be produced next quarter
will be held Wednesday afternoon and
evening instead of on Thursday as pre
viously announced. They will be held
in the Assembly Hall from 3 to 5
o'clock in the afternoon and from 7
to 8 in the evening, under the direc
tion of Coach Godron Davis and the
try-out committee appointed.
The fact that a person has partici
pated in a dramatic production this
quarter does not make him ineligible
for this play, as it is not to be pro
duced until next quarter. Due to the
short time in which to rehearse, parts
are to be handed out before the
Christmas holidays.
