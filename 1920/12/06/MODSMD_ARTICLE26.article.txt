### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.—Four players
from Wisconsin, four from Illinois, two
from Ohio State and one lowh have
won places on the "All-Western Con
ference" football team, picked by E.
C. Patterson in Collier's Weekly of
December 11.
His choice for first and second teams
are:
First team: —Carney, Illinois (end);
Scott, Wisconsin (tackle); Bunge,
Wisconsin (guard); Depler, Illinois
(center); Trott, Ohio State (guard);
Huffman, Ohio State (tackle); Weston,
Wisconsin (end); A. Devine, lowa
(quarter); Elliot, Wisconsin (half
back; R.Fletcher, Illinois (half-back);
Cargle, Illinois (fullback).
Second team —Belding, lowa (end);
McGuire, Chicago (tackle); Brader,
Wisconsin (guard); Nemecek, Ohio
State (center); J. Taylor, Ohio State
(guard); Slater, lowa (tackle); Stinch
comb, Ohio State (end); Workman,
Ohio State (quarter); Walquis;t, Illi
nois (half-back); G. Devine, lowa (half
back); Sundt, Wisconsin (full-back).
Commenting on football in the West
ern Conference, Patterson says that
400,000 spectators paid between $f>oo,-
000' and $600,000 to see the confer
ence games. He attributes the suc
cess of the season to the interest
shown by the fans and makes an ap

peal on behalf of them to have the
players numbered in the future.
"Man for man," he says, "Wisconsin
was unquestionable represented by the
best team in the conference, but, not
withstanding this, she lost an early
game to Ohio State by sheer stupidity
on her side and daring brilliancy on
the part of Wilce's scrappy eleven.
"Ohio State> the champion, was rep
resented by a team without any out
standing stars, but she had a team
where all her men played consistent
football from whistle to whistle. Their
line work offensively was only fair
and defensively it was good, but they
proved themselves to be past masters
in the forward passing game, with
Workman shooting and Stinchcomb re
ceiving. Most, if not all their victor
ies, were the result of the passing.
Long passes seemed to predominate.
Either one of two things: they knew
the passing end better than any team
in the conference,* or they dared to
take more chances.
"The conference teams this year
were inferior to the eastern teams in
offensive and defensive line work.
They unquestionably lacked the power
and polish that eastern teams possess
ed, but Wisconsin, Illinois and Ohio
State were decidedly superior to the
best eastern teams in forward passing.

"Man for man," he says, "Wisconsin
was unquestionable represented by the
best team in the conference, but, not
withstanding this, she lost an early
game to Ohio State by sheer stupidity
on her side and daring brilliancy on
the part of Wilce's scrappy eleven.
"Ohio State> the champion, was rep
resented by a team without any out
standing stars, but she had a team
where all her men played consistent
football from whistle to whistle. Their
line work offensively was only fair
and defensively it was good, but they
proved themselves to be past masters
in the forward passing game, with
Workman shooting and Stinchcomb re
ceiving. Most, if not all their victor
ies, were the result of the passing.
Long passes seemed to predominate.
Either one of two things: they knew
the passing end better than any team
in the conference,* or they dared to
take more chances.
"The conference teams this year
were inferior to the eastern teams in
offensive and defensive line work.
They unquestionably lacked the power
and polish that eastern teams possess
ed, but Wisconsin, Illinois and Ohio
State were decidedly superior to the
best eastern teams in forward passing.
