# FROSH SOCCER TEAM LOSES TO BLUE AND GOLD IN FAST GAME
## 
### 
California's freshman soccer team de
feated the Cardinal freshmen, 6-0, in
the second of a two-game series Satur
day afternoon on the local turf. The
game was staged as a preliminary to
the varsity contest. It was a rather one
sided battle, as Stanford's freshmen
were outclassed hy their opponents in
teamwork, although in individual play
ing they showed plenty of fight and
ability.
The chief cause of the freshmen's
downfall was the fact that their com
bination work was shattered by the
absence of Captain Todd from the game.
Todd's regular position, center half, had
to lie taken by Swayne, whose removal
from the forward line threw the team
work there out of gear. Morris played
inside right in place of Swayne. The
absence of Captain Todd, who is an ex
perienced player, was felt very keenly
by the whole team, and the removal of
Swayne from the forward line to plug
up the gap left by Todd caused con
fusion in the forwards, who had been
accustomed to rally about Swayne in his
position. Thus effective teamwork was
impossible, and it is no doubt due to
this that the game came out the way it
did.
This game gives the California fresh
men the series, as the iirst contest,
staged three weeks ago, ended in a 3-3
tie.
The lineup of the teams follows:
Stanford Freshmen —Genereaux, goal;
Tucker, right back; Snell, left back;
Sanders, right half; Swayne, center
half; Phelps, left half; Morris, inside
right; Elmore, center right; Menees,
center forward; Bussy, outside left.
