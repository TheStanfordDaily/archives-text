# TRAINING CAMP PLAN CALLS FOR HELP OF EX-OFFICERS HERE
## 
### 
Calls have come to many Stanford
men who were officers in the late war
to join the association known as the
Government Training Camps Associa
tion. The work of the association is
to interest young men and boys be
tween the age of eighteen and twenty
in the plan of preparation for a po
sition as an officer in the army if
fchere should ever be another call such
as at the outbreak of the Great War.
When war was declared on April f>,
1917, more than 90,000 trained men
were furnished to start the funda
mental wol-k of the new recruits.
These men came from the civilian
training camps that had been in ex
istence since 1913 when the Platts
burg idea was adopted by the War
Department. Each summer men of
college standing were admitted to the
training camps for a period of from
six weeks to two months and a half
and were given intensive training in
the art of things military. At the
end of the period they were in con
dition to go out with their fundament
al knowledge and help in the training
of recruits.
The Training Camps Association
now calls on the officers of the late
war to give their services in helping
develop the canlps to where they reach
all the younger men who wish to at
tend the summer courses. The age
limit set by the government is 20
years. T. T. C. Gregory, '99, is one
of the governing body in the western
department and Roy C. Naftzger also
a Stanford man is another. The head
quarters of the association for the
western department are in Los An
geles, in charge of S. M. Spalding.
