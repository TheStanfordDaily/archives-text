College elevens Saturday, on the Roble
Field, when the juniors defeated their
opponents by a score of 3 to 0, and
tue sopnomores and freshmen won
their matches by scores of 2 to 0. The
action in all three games was excep
tionally snappy. The Mills teams put
up a good light, but the offensive of
the Stanford women proved to be too
strong.
The freshmen game was called at
11:30 in the morning, the Mills team
having been delayed en route. At the
end of the first half the score stood
a 0 to 0 tie. Most of the play was

fiifteen minutes. The goals were made
by E. Biddle and R. Jamison. Eloene

star of the freshman team. She play
ed a consistent and steady game all
throughout the match.

the score down to 0 to 0 at the end of
the first half. In the second half,
Mary Leonard, playing at goal, kept
Mills' team from scoring by a single
shot that sent the ball spinning half
way down the field. Both goals for
Stanford sophomores were made by
Louise Cannon in the second half.
Esther Culver, at center forward,
played the hardest game, but the
whole match was marked by the ex
cellent team work on the part of the
Sophomores.
The junior teams of both colleges
were exceptionally well matched. The
Stanford junior eleven was practically
an all star aggregation, the whole
team playing as a unit with very little
individual starring. This was the
fastest of the three games, and had
more action than either of the preced
ing matches. The first goal for Stan
ford was knocked by Marjorie Ford
near the end of the first half. This
made a tally of 1-0 in the favor of
Stanford at the close of the first fif
teen minutes. The second goal was

star of the freshman team. She play
ed a consistent and steady game all
throughout the match.
Mills' offensive was better in the
sophomore game. The Stanford eleven
showed consistant team play and held
the score down to 0 to 0 at the end of
the first half. In the second half,
Mary Leonard, playing at goal, kept
Mills' team from scoring by a single
shot that sent the ball spinning half
way down the field. Both goals for
Stanford sophomores were made by
Louise Cannon in the second half.
Esther Culver, at center forward,
played the hardest game, but the
whole match was marked by the ex
cellent team work on the part of the
Sophomores.
The junior teams of both colleges
were exceptionally well matched. The
Stanford junior eleven was practically
an all star aggregation, the whole
team playing as a unit with very little
individual starring. This was the
fastest of the three games, and had
more action than either of the preced
ing matches. The first goal for Stan
ford was knocked by Marjorie Ford
near the end of the first half. This
made a tally of 1-0 in the favor of
Stanford at the close of the first fif
teen minutes. The second goal was
knocked by Margaret Carlsmith about
the middle of the second half, and
Marjorie Ford made the third point
about two seconds before the final
whistle blew.
There was quite a large crowd of
Stanford men and women and Mills
College rooters. The visiting teams
played well in all three matches. Their
team work was excellent, especially
that of the Mills junior team, and it
was only because the Stanford teams
were better that the final results stood
as they did. All three matches were
refereed by Miss Ruth Elliott of Cali
fornia.
