# DEBATING MEDAL GIFT TO MEXICAN COLLEGE
## Stanford Alumni Arrange For Annual Forensic Contests Among University Students 
### 
A group of Stanford alumni who
have had business experience in Mexico
have, in cooperation with Stanford Uni
versity and the National University of
Mexico, established an annual inter
collegiate debate in Mexico for the
"Medal of Stanford University."
The debate, which is open to students
of the Schools of Jurisprudence of the
Mexican Republic, will be held each year
in the City of Mexico during the month
of July. It is to be an extempore dis
cussion modeled on the annual Joffie
debate between Stanford and the Uni
versity of California, the subject to be
debated each year must relate to His
panic American countries and to the
relation between these countries and the
United States, the purpose of the de
bates being "to encourage the study of
problems of Hispanic American coun
tries and of the relation of those coun
tries to each other and to the United
States, and to bring about a better
understanding between them."
The leader in the enterprise is V. R.
Gortias, who graduated from Stanford
in 1907, and who was afterwards a pro
fessor in the Geology and Mining De
partment, and who has since then been
engaged in mining engineering projects
in Mexico. A group of other Stanford
men, geologists and mining engineers,
who have also carried on engineering
enterprises in Mexico, have established
a fund the interest of which will furnish
the annual gold "Medal of Stanford
University," and provide for printing
and distributing the speech of the win
ner of the debate. The design for this
medal is now being completed.
The specific topic for discussion each
year will be announced only two hours
before the debate and the contestants
will be assigned their sidC of the debate
at the same time. These contestants will
be selected through a series of prelim
inary debates to be held three days be
fore the final contest.
The speech of the winner each year,
and of such others as may be consid
ered worthy of it, will be published in
English and in Spanish by Stanford
University and distributed "to the uni
versities and centers of culture of Mex
ico, North America and other countries."
