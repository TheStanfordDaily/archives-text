# SOPHOMORE COTILLION IS BIG SUCCESS
## 
### 
The sophomore class is to be com
mended on the originality cxercised in
the decoration of the Gymnasium for
the Sophomore Cotillion, last Friday
night. The idea of a hunter's lodge was
carried out in every detail, skins and
trappings hanging from the burlap wall:-.,
and huge fireplaces at the ends of the
room. Punch was served from a bat
tered old keg, and wood-nymphs (in tin.
form of Roughs) peeked through the
crevices at the festivities.
But there was a decidedly modern and
civilized touch to the whole thing—thai
was the syncopated orchestra,
of campus t&icnt. This was unusually
good and did much to make the dance a
success.
