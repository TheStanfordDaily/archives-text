# PATRICK ELECTED CAPTAIN OF 1921 FOOTBALL ELEVEN
## Varsity Men Choose Player as Leader Who Started With team as Waterboy 
### 
From office boy to president, is not
an uncommon business saying. It
had its parallel yesterday in Stanford
athletics, when Jack Patrick, '21, was
elected captain of the 1921 football
team.
Patrick's devotion to Stanford ath
letics started back in 1912, when as
a grammar school boy at Palo Alto
High School, he was the official mascot
of University teams. He acted as
custodian of footballs, commander of
the water bucket and during baseball
season as official bat boy. During
this time, Patrick no doubt, made reso
lutions to same day be a football play
er himself and perhaps some day be
the leader of the Stanford Varsity.
He entered Stanford in the fall of
1917 and was a member of the fresh
man team of that year which defeated
Santa Clara, 16 to 8. The following
year he was the star of the otherwise
weak S. A. T. C. American Football
team. Last year Patrick came into
his own as a backfield man. In the
14 to 10 game with California he was
put into the game in the last quarter
and started the assault that will al
ways be considered a "moral victory"
for the Cardinal.
During the past summer Patrick
was a member cf the American rugby
team to the Olympic Games. He ac
companied the team to Southern
France but was forced to cut the trip
short in order to return to Stanford
to play with the 1920 varsity. He
played at fullback during the past sea
son, being well known as a terrifit line
plunger and a star on the defense.
It is unlikely that California has
heard the last of the Patricks either,
as Jacq has a younger brother who is
now acting in the same capacity that
gave the captain-elect his start in ath
letics.
Patrick is a member of the Delta
Upsilon fraternity.
