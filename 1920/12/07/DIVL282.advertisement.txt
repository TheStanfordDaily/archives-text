Reduced:

All our FEATHER-TREAD Shoes have been reduced 15

All of our stock of High Grade Party Slippers has been re

All our Children's and Boys' and Growing Girls' Shoes have
been reduced from 15 to 35 per cent.
Furthermore:
This revision of prices has been going on since last June. It has been
the policy of The Herold Shoe Store to make these reductions quietly
and consistently, without regard to original cost of the merchandise to
us. Just as soon as new market prices were quoted our prices ivere ad
justed accordingly, oftentimes on the very same day that prices were
quoted to us for next Spring's delivery.
Now we do not want you to gain the impression that these reductions
were made for your benefit alone, an impression we sometimes get
from advertisements in these times. We have made them simply be
cause it's good business policy.
