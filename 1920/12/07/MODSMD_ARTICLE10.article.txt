# FRESHMAN BASKETERS ARE PRACTICING HARD TO MAKE THEIR TEAM
## 
### 
The freshmen held their first real
basketball practice last night in the
gymnasium under the supervision of
Coach Duffy Seay. More than fifty
men reported on time at 7 o'clock and
an hour of passing and basket-shoot
ing was had until the coach had a
chance to get a line on the various
men.
After 8 o'clock Coach Seay formed
six teams and lined them up into
games on the three indoor small
courts in the gymnasium. No special
men were picked for the teams and
they formed rather as the different
groups that are living together. Some
good material showed up in the for
ward positions and a couple of men
are looking good at center. The pick
up teams played for nearly an hour
with frequent substitutions and then
called it an evening.
Coach Seay plans to work his squad
of babes hard for the next week and
then cut the squad to a number with
which he can work more easily. The
first cut will not be final and work
in the squad after Christmas will show
whether the rest of the men will
maintain their places on the first
string of the freshman varsity. The
work this week will be chiefly goal
shooting practice and short scrim
mages at the ends of the practice
periods.
The freshmen are practicing be
tween 7 and 9 p.m., in the evening
now and so they can not be seen along
with the varsity. After the first of
the year they will no doubt have some
workouts between the two strings.
