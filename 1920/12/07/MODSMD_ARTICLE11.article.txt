Ou Sunday afternoon Warren D.
Allen made a special Christmas pro
gram at Memorial Church. The pro
gram was entirely composed of
selections which were well chosen.
The first number was the "March of
the Magli Kings," by Theo. Dubois.
This was followed by the beautiful
Christinas Pastorale from Handel's
"Messiah." Then there was a selec
tion of French origin, "Noel's Sur Les
Flutes," by Louis Loquian, and a
fantasy of English Carols by W. T.
Best. The last number was "Holy
Night., Peaceful Night," by Q. Bruber.
The program was repeated this after
noon at 4:15.
