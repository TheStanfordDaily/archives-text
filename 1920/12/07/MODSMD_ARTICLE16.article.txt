# U. C. President Faces $20,000 Libel Suit By Former Student
## 
### 
Melvin V. Wood, formerly a student
of Stanford University, has filed a
$20,000 libel suit against President
Barrows of the University of Cali
fornia. He bases his claim for dam
ages upon the fact that his name ap
peared in a list of students suspended
for dishonesty in an examination.
The contention of Judge Wood, the
father of the student, and head of the
Alameda County Bar Association, is
that a student who passively allows
a fellow student to copy from his
paper cannot be accused of "dishon
esty" and that a demand for the name
of the man who copied is a demand to
"turn spy and informer."
The attitude of authorities has al
ways been that the one who gives aid
is as guilty as the one who receives it.
This attitude is not always reflected
in student opinion. The outcome of
this suit will be a decision fixing the
legal status of cheating as a misde
meanor, in which the accomplice as
sumes a full share of the guilt.
