# PASQUALE AMATO WILL SING HERE THURSDAY
## Peninsula Music Association Will Present Metropolitan Baritone at Assembly Hall 
### 
Pasquale Amato, leading baritone of
the Metropolitan Opera House in New
York, will sing here in concert undc.*
the auspices of the Peninsula Musical
Association at the Assembly Hall next
Thursday evening.
Amato, who, it is agreed by critics,
is to the baritone world what Caruso
is to the tenor, has had a concedt careei
as phenomenal as his career in the
operatic world. Since his debut at the
Metropolitan, in 1908, he has been ii.
constant demand for concerts, musicales,
festivals and with orchestras. He ha.>
appeared with all the leading American
orchestras each year, the Philadelphia
Symphony, the Boston Symphony, the
New York Symphony, the New York
Philharmonic and many others. During
the festival season, from the end of
April to the end of May, his engage
ments might be called a series of one
night stands. During the month of May
one season he sang in musical festival.-,
in Savannah, Charleston, Columbia,
Raleigh, Lynchburg, Richmond, Nor
folk, Keene, Ann Arbor and- Evanston.
This is a festival record which ha.>
rarely been exceeded. But Mr. Amato
was unable to repeat this again,, smcc
it would prove strenuous after a full
opera season at the Metropolitan.
He has been heard in every state in
concert. Those few that he has not
touched personally have proved to be
enthusiastic purchasers of his phono
graph records.
Amato sings in French, Italian, Span
ish, German and English, and his pro
grams always contain many of the lattei
songs having a popular appeal.
