# SOCCER COACHES EXPECTED TO PICK ALL-STAR ELEVEN
## 
### 
What Stanford soccer players will be
given a place on the Stanford-California
"All-Star" aggregation that will invade
British Columbia during Christmas va
cation? That is a question which has
not yet been answered, and which does
not admit of much guesswork. Both the
Cardinal and Blue and Gold teams are
combinations that gain their victories
by teamwork rather than by the indi
vidual starring of some one or two men.
Therefore the selection to be made will
have to be largely on the basis of pick
ing men from both teams who will work
well together and insure a smooth
running soccer machine.
The actual selection of the men who
will represent Stanford and California
on the team will be made tomorrow oi
Thursday, when Coach Maloney meets
the California soccer coach, Matthews.
The two coaches will make a selection
which will probably be a permanent one.
It may be changed, however, if the team
does not show up well enough against
the Olympic Club in a game scheduled
for Saturday. This game will give an
opportunity to see how the "All-Star"
aggregation works together, and con
siderable interest is being manifested on
the size of the score it will be able to
roll up against the clubmen.
The University and Club Soccer
League will take a rest until after New
Years, when the playing schedule wili
be resumed. Stanford is the undisputed
leader, being three points ahead of the
nearest rival, the Olympic Club. The
Cardinal soccerites have not lost a sin
gle game this season, have tied but one,
and won five. California is hanging on
to third place, where she was sent altci
her beating Saturday.
