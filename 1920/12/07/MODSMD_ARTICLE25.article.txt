# A
						HOME-COMING DAY
## 
### 
Stanford lias been making a stupendous effort to bring- her alumni
in closer touch with the University by various means. The campaign
has succeeded to some extent, but real relation between the alumni and
the students can best be obtained by inducing the alumni to return to the
University for a visit.
Under the present arrangement the alumni return to the University
during Commencement Week, after the regular college session is over,
and all they find is a desolate Quad, and a few customary commencement
exercises. They make such a visit probably once in ten years, and never
see the University during the interval.
If they can be induced to make a pilgrimage to the University while
it is in session and while some of the college life which they were once
used to is evident, the alumni might feel that they still have something
in common with their Alma Mater. Once they get here and meet their
old friends and feel at home they might be prevailed upon to make an
nual visits.
The Stanford-California track meet and baseball series come off in
the spring, and during this period a Home-Coming Day could be set.
Various entertainments could be provided in the way of Glee Club and
band concerts, a student body dance and class reunions. Such an occa
sion might produce the desired results.
