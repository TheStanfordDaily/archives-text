To the Editor:
Through the courtesy of the editoi
of the Daily Palo Alto, an eleventh
hour notice was inserted in Friday's
issue of the Daily Palo Alto, asking tha
sufficient volunteers from the military
and members of the American Legion
report to the commander of Fremont
Post, American Legion, at Encina Gym
nasium, Saturday morning last at 9
o'clock, the purpose being to form a
firing squad to escort the remains of a
fellow comrade to his last resting place.
Sad to relate, not one man showed up.
At the last moment an appeal was
made to Major Collins, professor of
military science and tactics at Stanford,
who generously furnished a firing squad
and bugler with a lieutenant acting as
corporal of the squad, the entire squad
being members of the regular enlisted
personnel doing duty with the artilleiy
unit at Stanford.
The deceased ex-service man was a
Palo Alto boy, born in this vicinity,
where he attended school until Americd
entered the war, at which time he of
fered his services to his country as an

expert in wireless. During his stay in
the service he contracted an allness that
was primarily responsible for his death.
Too bad, however, when one stops to
consider that there are almost two hun
dred members of the Legion in the
student body, not to mention over one
hundred who are taking vocational
training, that a firing squad, consisting
of eight men, could not be induced to
report as requested, to pay their last
respects to a former comrade in arms.
Those that did not see the notice are not
to blame, but surely more than sufficient
to form a squad did read the request 'o
give their services.
The first paragraph of the constitu
tion of the American Legion contains
the following passage as being the pri
mary object of the organization:
"To foster and perpetuate a 100 per
cent Americanism, to preserve the
memories and incidents of our associa
tion in the great war ; to consecrate and
sanctify our comradeship by our devo
tion to mutual helpfulness."
The question is, fellow Legion mem
bers, Are we living up to the constitu
tion ?
H. WILFRED MALONEY,
Commander Fremont Post No. 52.
