To these students this article will
serve little other purpose than to pos
sibly furnish new sidelights on the life
of a man they already know. Murray
Shipley Wildman is probably in contact
with more students today through his
position os head of the Economics De
partment than any other member of the
faculty. One-fourth of the student body,
approximately, is enrolled in the de
partment, and the responsibility of major
adviser to this large group rests upon
one man, Dr. Wildman.
A recital of the facts of his early life
is interesting to Stanford because it
reveals the story of a compelling desire
to secure an education. There are large
and conspicuous gaps between the
periods lie attended school. Following
his graduation from the High School a L
Selma, Ohio, in 1887, he spent two years
teaching. Four years at Earlham Col
lege, Indiana, gave him a collegiate de
gree. Teaching, banking and managing
commercial houses describe the next
eight years. His final university work
was undertaken at the University of
Chicago. As a Fellow in Political Econ
omy from 1901 to 1904 he was awarded
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in
the latter year.
A varied career as a university pro
fessor of economics followed for the
succeeding eight years. A year at Cen
tral College, Missouri, four years at the
University of Missouri, and three spent
at Northwestern University form the
collegiate background of the man who

was called to Stanford in 1912 to be
come head of the Economics Depart
ment.
The growth of the department under
the guidance of Dr. Wildman is a mat
ter of common knowledge. The number
of "Econ." majors has tripled in the
last eight years, and the students from
other departments who take economics
courses crowd the classrooms.
Readjustment and expansion are al
ways difficult and the adaptability of the
department to the changes of the last
few years is in no small measure a
tribute to the sane leadership of the
head of the department. Classes of a
practical nature, as secretarial training,
have been instituted by Dr. Wildman,
who has succeeded in meeting different
demands upon the department by offer
ing both the practical courses and those
in the theory of economics.
Though primarily a teacher, much of
his most interesting work has been done
outside the schoolroom. Prior to enter
ing university work he was active in
business life, being organizer and cashier
of a bank and later secretary of a manu
facturing company. In 1911 and 1912 Dr.
Wildman served as secretary of the Na
tional Citizens' League, a national organ
ization urging reform of the American
banking system. The campaign of the
league was largely responsible for the
creation of public sentiment which led
to the passage of the Federal Reserve
Act in 1913. As an author his work on
"Money Inflation in the United States"
is an authority to students of finance.
During the war he served in turn with
the Bureau of Reasearch, War Trade
Board and the Division of Planning and
Statistics of the War Industries Board.

his most interesting work has been done
outside the schoolroom. Prior to enter
ing university work he was active in
business life, being organizer and cashier
of a bank and later secretary of a manu
facturing company. In 1911 and 1912 Dr.
Wildman served as secretary of the Na
tional Citizens' League, a national organ
ization urging reform of the American
banking system. The campaign of the
league was largely responsible for the
creation of public sentiment which led
to the passage of the Federal Reserve
Act in 1913. As an author his work on
"Money Inflation in the United States"
is an authority to students of finance.
During the war he served in turn with
the Bureau of Reasearch, War Trade
Board and the Division of Planning and
Statistics of the War Industries Board.
'"What is our major subject-" Un

neering Corner or the Law Steps, tiie
odds favor the reply to be, "Why,
'Econ.,' of course."
To these students this article will
serve little other purpose than to pos
sibly furnish new sidelights on the life
of a man they already know. Murray
Shipley Wildman is probably in contact
with more students today through his
position os head of the Economics De
partment than any other member of the
faculty. One-fourth of the student body,
approximately, is enrolled in the de
partment, and the responsibility of major
adviser to this large group rests upon
one man, Dr. Wildman.
A recital of the facts of his early life
is interesting to Stanford because it
reveals the story of a compelling desire
to secure an education. There are large
and conspicuous gaps between the
periods lie attended school. Following
his graduation from the High School a L
Selma, Ohio, in 1887, he spent two years
teaching. Four years at Earlham Col
lege, Indiana, gave him a collegiate de
gree. Teaching, banking and managing
commercial houses describe the next
eight years. His final university work
was undertaken at the University of
Chicago. As a Fellow in Political Econ
omy from 1901 to 1904 he was awarded
the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in
the latter year.
A varied career as a university pro
fessor of economics followed for the
succeeding eight years. A year at Cen
tral College, Missouri, four years at the
University of Missouri, and three spent
at Northwestern University form the
collegiate background of the man who

was called to Stanford in 1912 to be
come head of the Economics Depart
ment.
The growth of the department under
the guidance of Dr. Wildman is a mat
ter of common knowledge. The number
of "Econ." majors has tripled in the
last eight years, and the students from
other departments who take economics
courses crowd the classrooms.
Readjustment and expansion are al
ways difficult and the adaptability of the
department to the changes of the last
few years is in no small measure a
tribute to the sane leadership of the
head of the department. Classes of a
practical nature, as secretarial training,
have been instituted by Dr. Wildman,
who has succeeded in meeting different
demands upon the department by offer
ing both the practical courses and those
in the theory of economics.
Though primarily a teacher, much of
his most interesting work has been done
