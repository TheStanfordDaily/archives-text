## 
### 
Two games of the first round of the
Intramural Basketball were played
yesterday afternoon on the Encina
courts. Theta Chi downed the S. A. E.
team, by a 15 to 6 score, and the
Sigma Nu vanquished the Japanese
Club, 8 to 5.
The Theta Chi-S. A. E. game was
close during the first half. Neither
side scored until just before half time.
The superior team work of the Theta
Chi squad began to show itself in
second half, and they gradually drew
away from their opponents.
The Japs showed lots of fight in
their game with the Sigma Nu team,
and kept the fraternity men on the
jump to keep ahead. The Sigma Nus
seemed to have difficulty in dropping
the ball in the basket, but were able
to keep the sphere in their possession
most of the time.
Today, the teams of League 4 will
tangle. Delta Tau Delta plays El
Toro; Alpha Tay Omega battles with
Encina W. 3rd; and Theta Delta Chi
mixes it with Alpha Delta Phi.
