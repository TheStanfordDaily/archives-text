Ye "Sparks" ed. awaitcth! Having
launched the eolyum in a shower of its
title, little remains to print till a busy
little bee hums an inspiration in the ear
of the erstwhile jokesmith. Verily, ye
"Sparks" ed. awaitcth!

"THANATOPSIS"
So study that when thy summons
comes to take,
The inevitable exes which crool profs
insist an givin'
Thou go not like the lone Frosh at
night,
To be doused in muddy Searsville;
But sustained and soothed by an un
faltering dope sheet;
Approach thy finals,
As one who contains all the informa
tion in his brain,
Like a sponge that needs but to be
wrung dry. —Vee.

Charley Magne suggests that as an
antidote to Bolshevism, bulls be al
lowed to do the goose step with the
color bearers. Fair enough, but con
sider the consequences of turning a
confirmed barber with a touch of
kleptomania into the ranks. We'd
never hear of Sampson and Delilah
again.

LITTLE ZEKE SEZ
Somethin's happened to my roomie
I simply can't explain
He never smokes or chews no more
Says he'll never drink again.
He was a good pal to me once
We ran around all night
Playin' poker, shootin' dice
Often gettin' tight.
But he never goes with me no more
He goes I know not where
He gets four shines a day
And plasters down his hair.
I think he's going crazy
I know he's lost his head
He forgets to go to dinner
Forgets to go to bed.
t
His pressing bill is growing large
He gets a hair cut everyday
Now could you tell me, someone,
What makes the boy that way?
—Daily Texan.

We of the Greek department notice
that the Geology bench has been re
placed by one lone chair, with two
logs. Also there is no black in evi
dence about the dead-language de
partment.
