# FIRST RIGID AIRSHIP TO BE BUILT IN U.S. IS IN PHILADELPHIA
## 
### United Press 
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 7.—The
League Island aircraft plant, said to
be the largest of its kind in the world,
has begun work on the new fleet air
ship No. 1, the first rigid airship to be
built in the United States. Modeled
on German Zeppelin plans, the airship
will resemble the R-38, which is now
under construction in England for the
United States Navy. When completed,
airship No. 1 will be assigned to the
Atlantic Fleet for training and instruc
tion in scouting.
Four hundred and thirty-two planes,
of a dozen types, have been turned
out by the naval aircraft factory, a
survival of the government's supreme
effort to cope with allied demand for
air supremacy in the late war. Ap
proximately 350 completed planes, a
part of the surplus war material said
to value $55,000,000, awaited disposi
tion today in a huge storage build
ing.
Eighty per cent, of the work done
in the factory is new construction,
while 20 per cent, is devoted to ex
perimental, research and develop
ment work, according to Commander
G. C. Westervelt, manager. Every
factor, excepting motors, that enters
into the construction of an airplane
is manufactured here. United States
mail planes are repaired at the plant.
Commander H. C. Richardson, who
participated in the transatlantic flight
of the N-C boats in the spring of 1919,
is chief engineer of the factory.
The working force has been reduced
from the war-time activity of over
5,000 to 1,400. Of that number, 200
are women. Approximately $5,000,000
was spent by the navy department in
building the aircraft factory, which
covers 46 acres. Its group of build
ings occupy a floor space of 950,000
square feet. What is claimed to be
the largest airplane hangar in the
world.
