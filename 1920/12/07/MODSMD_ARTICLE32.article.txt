# AGE IS PROVED NO BAR TO ATHLETICS

NEW YORK, Dec. 7 —Young blood
holds the sceptre of the athletic arid
sport world.
Youngsters have come so complete
ly in power that, outside of baseball,
an athlete is considered on the back
slide when he rounds the twenty
eighth milestone of his course.
Like all other rules, however, the
exceptions to this rule are more inter
esting than its proofs.
Age battled with youth more evenly
in the Olympic Games than in any
other contest of recent years.
Take Albert Hill, for instance, the
British runner who was one of the
two athletes to win two events.
Hill is thirty-five years of age and
retired from athletics before the war,
yet he came back and won the 800 and
1500 metre runs.
Hodge, the British cross country
runner, is another notable come-back.
He is thirty-two years of age and had
been out of a track suit for five years.
Yet he outran a field of young blood
and won the 3000 metre steeplechase.
Phillip Baker, another 30-year-old
Englishman, was second in the high
jump and beat Dick Landon in the
dual meet between the American and
English teams in London after the
Olympic Games.
The three New York police whales
—Pat Ryan, Pat McDonald and Matt
McGratli, are notable examples of
veterans withstanding the rush of
time.
The Finns had Johnny Myrra, a
thirty-four-year-old giant, who threw
the javelin for a world's record.
Among our boxing celebrities is the
veteran Jack Britt.on, welterweight,
champion, who clings to his title al
though he is 35 years of age. Johnny
Kilbane, gray haired at thirty-two, is
still the featherweight champion.
Baseball lists veterans galore who
are still active, although "well up in
years," as Dode Paskert, 39; Gavvy
Cravath, '38; Jake Daubert, 35; Ed
Konetchy, 35; Tvy Olson, 35; Larry
Doyle, 34; Art Fletcher, 34; Tv Cobb,
34; Eddie Collins, 33; Ping Bodie, 33;
and Ainsmith, 33.
