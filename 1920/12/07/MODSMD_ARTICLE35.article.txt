# CLEVER FARCES AND COMEDIES FEATURED BY CIRCLE FRANCAIS
## 
### 
"The plays given at Stanford shame
the efforts of our California French
Clubs," exclaimed a U. C. professor
to the President of the Stanford
French Club, Mr. Schwartz, as he
looked at the comedy sketches on the
program to be presented free of
charge, Wednesday evening in the
Little Theater.
Both farces are from the pen of
masters of the drama. "Rosalie," by
Max Mauey, is a light little piece with
a laugh in every line. The conclud
ing act of Les Femmes Fortes, (Wild
Women) by Victorien Sardou is a
classic in light farce. It is said that
Sardou is the new dramatist who
never penned a failure.
Rosalie is snappy in dialogue, rich
in action, and full of suspense. The
quick-witted little servant, who lias
borne the brunt of her master's sharp
tongue makes good use of the oppor
tunities which come to her through
the preparations of her master for the
visit of a rich friend.
In Les Femmes Fortes, Jonathan,
heir to a large estate in France is
obliged to contend for possession with
a band of ."wild women" who are en
trenched there. After flowery speech
es, experiments in American flirta
tions, and displays of muscle fail,
Claire, an adopted daughter, and an
"old-fashioned" girl comes to his
rescue.
This drama is read in second-year
Fren.:h and many students unable to
appreciate unstudied lines, may be
able to enjoy a comedy, the text of
which they have thoroughly reviewed.
Raoul May, '22, will give an English
summary of each act before the cur
tain raises.
Few farces presented on this campus
have had a better adopted cast. Al
though none of the twelve members
are native to the French language, ao
cording to Mr. Schwartz, their coach,
and President of the French Club,
each present his lines in a finished
manner.
The work of Alexander Briggs as
Jonathan, and of Abigail Trist as
Rosalie is especially commended. They
are both natural comedians, and are
expected to furnish most of the fun.
rt is fortunate for the consistently
high comedy level of the evening's
entertainment that Miss Trist will ap
pear in the title role of Rosalie, while
Briggs will have the main Character
role in Sardou's riotous comedy.
One of the'reasons for the participa
tion of the French Club in campus the
atricals, is the fixed expense imposed
by the pledge to support two French
War Orphans. The plays which are
presented free of charge this quarter
and next will serve as foundation work
for the actors participating. This
training will enable them to present
in a pleasing professional manner the
several comedies which will compose
the program of the French Club
"Gala night on May 11th.
