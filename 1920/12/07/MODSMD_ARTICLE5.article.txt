1 lie Lost and Found Department,'
which is situated in the Administration
Building, is slowly becoming a depart
ment store. There is a complete jewelry
department with a fiine gold watch and
a watch fob which designates the owner
as being one of the class of '20. There
are numerous fraternity pins and em
blems, beads, rings, and stickpins. Then
(here is one shelf devoted to books, an
other to hats, caps, and old clothing,
while one complete section is made up
of miscellaneous articles such as an elec
tric torch, baseball bat, fishing poles,
hatpins, hair nets, hairpins, furs, and
othe paraphernalia.
In fact, any student desiring to get a
complete trousseau, by first applying to
the Lost and Found Department' would
get all the necessary articles with many
valuable additions. Most of these arti
cles have been accumulating for the last
six or seven years, and at the present
rate of addition the department will
have to be enlarged or else be given
more suitable quarters, unless there is
a run on the department.
