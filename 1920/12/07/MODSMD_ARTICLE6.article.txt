### 
Confident that the end of the New
Year's battle with Ohio State will see
the California varsity again victorious,
the Blue and Gold rooters are planning
to send a huge delegation to the annual
East-West classic at Pasadena.
Twenty-five hundred tickets were
placed on sale at the students' store yes
terday morning, selling $t $3.10. r lhe
U. C. students will occupy two sections,
one for the rooters and another for the
women students. Yell Leader "Red"
Drew has planned a new series of
bleacher stunts, including a welcoming
stunt for the Ohio State men. This wili
be an innovation for the Tourmuncnt
game, as bleacher stunts have never been
given at previous intersectional games.
Captain "Cort" Majors of the Bruin
varisty is confident that his team will
add the Buckee squad to its long list of
victims. "We are up aguinst a hard
game," he said. "All the support that
the students can give us in the way of a
strong rooting section will be needed.
We are going to do our best to win, and
with the cooperation of the rooting sec
tions glory and honor should be brought
to the Blue and Gold and the West."
Andy Smith is giving his men a tvvo
wceks' rest from football while they give
their energy to another battleâ€”final
examinations. Finals began yesterday at
California and will end December 15.
From then on the Bears will scrimmage
daily in preparation for the contest.
On the other hand, Coach Wilce is
putting his Buckeye artists through a
strenuous drill. He does not want his
men to get out of condition, and is
working on some new plays that' he
hopes will take the Bears off their feet.
He is giving special attention to the
development of the forward pass, for
which his team is famous.
Coach Smith is well satisfied with his
team's ability, both on offense and de
fense, and is not running any risk of
having his men get stale. He is not
worrying over the famed forward pass
ing of the Ohio aggregation, for he
believes he has a stonewall forward pass
defense.
