### 
The Stanford Art Gallery today
opened an exhibit of paintings by Mrs.
J. V. Cannon, formerly of Palo Alto.
Her collection is made up largely of
marine views which she painted at Mon
tara-by-the-Sea and Carmel. It will re
main in the Stanford Gallery for three
weeks.
Through the efforts of Pedro J.
Letnos, the curator of the Stanford Art
Gallery, collections of three California
artists have been received at the Uni
versity recently, including the collection
of Mrs. Cannon. Mr. Lemos says that
these exhibitions precede any single ex
hiliitions that have been made of the
works of California artists. Promises
have been secured from other prominent
artists of tlic state to send their exhibits
to the Stanford Gallery during the com
ing year. Collections of Eastern paint
ers will be secured to enable the patrons
of the gallery to compare the work of
both sections of the country.
