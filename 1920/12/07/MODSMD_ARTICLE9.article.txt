# WILSON SPEAKS TO U.S. SENATE; GIVES PROGRAM
## "Right Makes Might" Is First Theory of Wilson; Justice to Every Nation is Second 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â€”President
Wilson today called on Congress to an
nounce a program of legislation which
he said would put the United States in
the forefront in the movement to make
the spiritual power of democracy pre
vail throughout the world. In his tinal
message, which was sent to the two
houses by special messenger, the Presi
dent said that there are two ways in
which the United States may lead in
establishing the doctrine "right makes
might" in the world. These ways, he
said, are: "First, by offering the ex
ample within her own borders by pass
ing laws which are unquestionably right;
second, by standing for right and justice
toward individual nations."
The. President declared that the dis
play of an immediate disposition on the
part of Congress to remedy any injus
tices or evils that may have shown them
selves in our own national life will
afford the most effectual offset to the
forces of chaos and tyranny that are
playing so disastrous a part in the for
tunes of people in other parts of the
world.
Wilson did not mention the peacc
treaty nor the League of Nations in his
message. He submitted the following
program to carry out the other points:
1. Immediate passage of the budget
bill, that democracy may prove that it
can compete successfully in a business
like fashion as any other government.
2. Strictest economy in government
appropriations because of the $7,500,-
000,000 war indebtedness which will ma
ture in the next two and a half years.
3. Adequate provision for disabled
soldiers and sailors.
4. A government loan to Armenia,
suggesting it would be desirable to pro
vide that the money be expended undei
the supervision of a commissioner from
the United States.
5. Immediate revision of the tax laws.
6. Granting of independence to the
Philippines.
In addition, the President repeated
recommendations he made in previous
messages, encouraging aid to manufac
turers of dyestuffs and related cheni
icals, and laws controlling coal storage,
prescribing the methods; and recom
mended it would be most serviceable if it
were provided that all goods released
from cold storage tor interstate ship
ment would have plainly marked upon
each the selling price at the time it went
into storage, in order that the consumer
might learn what profits went between
him and the producer and the wholesale
dealer.
