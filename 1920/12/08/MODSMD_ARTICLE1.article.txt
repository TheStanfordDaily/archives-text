### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Dec. B.—Secretary
of the Treasury Houston today asked
Congress to boost the federal income
tax 2 per cent on incomes under $5,000.
Houston at the same time asked that the
sur-tax he lowered on some incomes
over $5,000. Corporations may he made
to pay 20 per cent on undivided profits.
It was recommended that some increases
be made on the existing consumeis'
taxes on cigars, cigarettes, chewing gum
and the like. Gasoline is to he taxed 2
cents a gallon and automobiles 50 certs
per horsepower.
At least $12,000,000,000 must be col
lected during the next three years if the
government is to pay the ordinary ex
penses and meet the $7,500 000,000 of
floating and Victory Loan debt before
1923.
Houston characterized as imperative
the necessity of a budget system in order
that the national finances should be han
dled on a business basis.
President Wilson's recommendations
to Congress are to be dismissed with
scant attention, according to the senti
ment expressed by Republican leaders
today in formal discussion of the mes
sage which was read to the two houses
yesterday.
The Republicans say that while they
agree with Wilson that the reconstruc
tion job should be started as soon as
possible, there is no hope of agreeing
with him as to the methods to be fol
lowed.
The one exception to the general re
jection of the President's requests was
the demand for immediate action on the
budget bill.
