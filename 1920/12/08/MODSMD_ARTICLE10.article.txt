# DEMOCRACY IS SUBJECT OF PICCOLI'S LECTURE
## Italian Professor Speaks On Italy, Medieval and Modern to Little Theatre Audience 
### 
Professor RafTaello Piccoli, professor
of English at the University of Pisa,
spoke last night on "Democracy in Italy
â€”Mediaeval and Modern." He is at the
present head of the Italian Department
of the University of California, acting
as a visiting professor under the invita
tion of the International Institute of
Education.

His first step in the lecture was to
draw a certain concept of each person s
view of democracy. He showed that
every person or nationality puts into the
meaning of the word democracy the po
litical ideals of the country in which
they may live. Progress was the rule by
which Professor Piccoli believed that
democracy should be measured in any
country.

Carlisle has said that the French Revo
lution was the beginning of a world
wide revolution of political ideas which
would last for 200 years. The speaker
pointer out the changes that England
and France had gone through. He
showed also that Italy had participated
in the ideas of democracy that the other
members of the European society of
nations had forced as a result of the
political revolution.

The professor went on to say that in
his estimation the thirteenth century was
the greatest one ir European history. It
was the most critical, as it gave rise to
the overthrow of old ideas. The revo
lution began in Italy in both political
and moral fields. Italy was the first to
emancipate itself from the fuedal idea.
The Italian towns of the thirteenth cen
tury were founded on the guild system.
It was through the guilds that culture
began to be shown among the laymen,
and the real Italian Renaissance began.
The guilds took up the preachings of
St. Francis and framed the moral views
of the times also. These views that were
formed at that time have persisted in
Italy throughout the centuries until the
present time.

In conclusion Professor Piccoli gave
a resume of recent events in Italy. He
told of the actions of the Italian work
ers and the significance of these actions.
He stated that although Italy found her
self in very serious economic conditions
that the ideas of democracy still re
mained that he was confident would
bring her safely over the crisis.
Professor Piccoli has an excellent
record as a soldier during the and
as a scholar bofqre and since. His latest
work is "The Book in Italy."
