# PADDOCK PREDICTS DOOM OF P. C. C. FOR REFUSING PETITION
## 
### P. C. Intercollegiate News Sevice 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.—"The Pa
cific Coast Conference has undoubtedly
made a mistake which will probably cost
her her very existence by refusing the
petition of U. S. C. in the manner 111
which she has done," said Charles W.
Paddock in a Trojan editorial this
morning.
The Trojan, official publication of the
University of Southern California, ap
peared this morning with the majority
of its space filled with condemnation of
the action of the Conference in refus
ing her admittance. Continuing, Pad
dock said : "When any organization adds
insult to injury, without provocation,
against any strong institution, that or
ganization is doomed to die. By her in
ternal quarreling the Pacific Coast Con
ference has completely lost that dignity
and prestige which should rightfully
belong to her, and no conference can
long exist without those requisites."

Another writer voices the opinion that
the South has not stood behind U. S. C.
as she deserved to be backed up. He
says: "And now, to top off this neglect
from her own community (not being
chosen for the Pasadena game), which
U. S. C. took in a really liberal-minded
spirit, without a complaint when the
choice was made, comes the action of
the Northern universities in barring U.
S. C. from the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. And this was done in the face of
the fact that the scholastic standing of
U. S. C.is unquestioned ,to say nothing
of her athletic standing. In football this
year the Trojans so badly beat the only
two conference teams with whom they
were able to get games that Stanford and
Oregon can hardly be said to be in the
same class with the Trojans."

The spirit of the Southerners seems
to be that the internal affairs of the
conference are not as they should be,
and that they received a poor deal all the
way round. This attitude is expressed in
an article by Editor Paddock, from
which article the final paragraph is
taken.

"U. S. C. does not want to enter a
conference whose actions arc so ungen
tlemanly, and whose spirit is so far for
eign to the manly spirit and courteous
treatment which this institution has at
all times displayed against her oppo
nents. U. S. C. will understand perfectly
how to meet any future invitations foi
her representatives to attend the Confer
ence for the sake of admission, for at
last the University of Southern Cali
fornia understands that she is far from
being in the same childish class as those
colleges who submit themselves to be
governed by such impossible and rabid
individuals as the members of the Pacific
Coast Conference."
