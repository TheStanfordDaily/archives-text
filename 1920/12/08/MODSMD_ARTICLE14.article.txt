# CHRISTMAS ISSUE OF STANFORD PICTORIAL TO APPEAR NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The Christmas issue of the "Stan
ford Pictorial" will be on sale next
week. Art work on the magazine
typifying the holiday season will feat
ure the make-up of the December num
ber and this idea will be carried out
i na novel photographic cover design
which the Pictorial staff thinks is the
dernier cri in campus magazine cov
ers. P. J. Lemos and E. R. Freeman
combined their efforts to produce this
novel cover effect, which will be the
first example of a noval idea which
will feature all future "Pictorial"
covers.

"Honors Easy" is the title of an ar
ticle exposing and criticising the work
ings of campus honor societies. The
article was written by Miss Ellen Cal
houn, '20, editor of the "Daily Palo
Alto" last year, and a keen alumni
observer of campus affairs. She
voices dissatisfaction with the pres
ent system of honor societies existing
at Stanford and very frankly bares
many of their shortcomings. Her idea
is that an honor society is not a mere
hall of fame, but it is a society which
performs a definite function in Uni
versity life. Her second point against
campus honor societies is made when
she says that many of them do not
live up to their function of being a
representative hall of fame. She con-,
eludes this discussion of campus hon
or and its present motheaten condi
tion by suggesting a very plausible
remedy.
E. E. Crowe, '21, "Daily" editor and
member of the "Pictorial" staff has
contributed an article entitled "More
Money or ?" In it he takes
up the plight of the "Daily Palo Alto"
which has expanded to the position of
ranking college publication of the
country and is now faced with reduc
tion in size or possibly suspension be
cause of the lack of finances. In the
article he suggests a means by which
these needed funds could be raised
and outlines what he considers to be
the future of the Stanford newspaper.
