# DAILY PALO ALTO REQUESTS FIFTY-CENT RAISE IN TUITION FEES; PAPER MIGHT SUSPEND IF AID IS NOT FORTHCOMING
## Financial Condition of Paper Makes More Funds Imperative 
### R. W. Kenny, '21 
A week from today the student body will decide whether it wants its
newspaper, the Daily Palo Alto, to be a paper of high school or university
dimensions. Action was taken last night by the Executive Committee to meet
the financial crisis facing the Daily at present. After proof had been sub
mitted by the Daily management showing that either more money from sub
scriptions must be had or a radical cut in size made, the Committee voted
to put these two alternatives to a Quad vote, Wednesday.

The proposition on which the students will vote then reads: "Shall the
students pay an additional 50 cents a quarter to the present registration fee,
thereby securing the Daily Palo Alto for $1.00 per quarter.

The reason for the Daily's present
precarious financial condition is due
primarily to the enormous increase in
the price of paper, printer's wages,
and the present business depression
which tightens the advertising field.
The advance in size of the Daily and
the added features such as the United
Press afternoon wire service have
formed a large item of expense on
the account. With these advancing
costs the subscription price of the
Daily has remained at the same place
when it was a five-column paper, con
taining less than half the matter that
the present Daily carries.
This condition of things finally
brought the Daily to a crisis. The
management of the paper has esti
mated that if some further source of
revenue is not discovered by next
month the Daily must reduce its size
to that of a four-column pamphlet,
containing a good deal less than half
of the matter that the present paper
carries. These considerations pre
sented before the Executive Commit
tee decided them to conduct the stu
dent vote next week.

A vote "Yes" on the proposition
will mean that for the sum of fifty
cents a student, Stanford will be able
to preserve the Daily Palo Alto in
position to live up to its present high
standards which make it rate with
the leading college dailies of the
country. It will mean that the United
Press service, which furnishes the
happenings of the day in world news
to the campus, will continue of be
a distinguishing feature of the Daily
Palo Alto. There is no afternoon
afternoon news service that reaches
the campus except through the Daily
Palo Alto and the United Press branch
of the Daily forms a valuable supple
ment to the world news carried in the
morning San Francisco papers.

At the present rate the Daily gets
50 cents a quarter from each student.
That makes a total rate of $1.50 a
year. The publications of other Coast
universities all get larger amounts
than this and from much larger stu
dent bodies. For instance, the Ore
gon Daily Emeiald gets $2.25 a year
from each of the 3500 students attend
ing the University of Oregon. The
Daily so far has been able to compete
with these other better favored pub
lications and cover itself with a good
deal of credit. That will be impossible
ofter this quarter, however, unless the
resolution is passed Wednesday.

If the "No's" should carry the vote
on the other hand, it would mean that
beginning next quarter the Daily Palo
Alto would have to appear as a small
four-column paper, stripped of all its
distinctive features. Continuing at
anything near the present size of the
paper would be a financial impossi
bility unless the students vote to give
the additional fifty cents. The pres
ent rate of $1.50 a year will not allow
the Daily to continue publication of
any paper larger in size than that of
the average high school paper.

Those who are backing the move
ment to give the Daily the raise in
subscription rates feel assured that
Stanford's pride will not allow its
daily paper to sink to such a plight.
Stanford publications have held a
premier rank in American college
journalism. The Daily Palo Alto was
the fifth college daily to be published
in the country and has had a steady
growth for twenty-five years. The
present publication marks the high
water mark of its development. If the
proposition does not carry heavily
next Wednesday, the Daily will meet
with the first retrogression in its long
and creditable history of progress.

the Daily to continue publication of
any paper larger in size than that of
the average high school paper.

Those who are backing the move
ment to give the Daily the raise in
subscription rates feel assured that
Stanford's pride will not allow its
daily paper to sink to such a plight.
Stanford publications have held a
premier rank in American college
journalism. The Daily Palo Alto was
the fifth college daily to be published
in the country and has had a steady
growth for twenty-five years. The
present publication marks the high
water mark of its development. If the
proposition does not carry heavily
next Wednesday, the Daily will meet
with the first retrogression in its long
and creditable history of progress.
A week from today the student body will decide whether it wants its
newspaper, the Daily Palo Alto, to be a paper of high school or university
dimensions. Action was taken last night by the Executive Committee to meet
the financial crisis facing the Daily at present. After proof had been sub
mitted by the Daily management showing that either more money from sub
scriptions must be had or a radical cut in size made, the Committee voted
to put these two alternatives to a Quad vote, Wednesday.

The proposition on which the students will vote then reads: "Shall the
students pay an additional 50 cents a quarter to the present registration fee,
thereby securing the Daily Palo Alto for $1.00 per quarter.

The reason for the Daily's present
precarious financial condition is due
primarily to the enormous increase in
the price of paper, printer's wages,
and the present business depression
which tightens the advertising field.
The advance in size of the Daily and
the added features such as the United
Press afternoon wire service have
formed a large item of expense on
the account. With these advancing
costs the subscription price of the
Daily has remained at the same place
when it was a five-column paper, con
taining less than half the matter that
the present Daily carries.
This condition of things finally
brought the Daily to a crisis. The
management of the paper has esti
mated that if some further source of
revenue is not discovered by next
month the Daily must reduce its size
to that of a four-column pamphlet,
containing a good deal less than half
of the matter that the present paper
carries. These considerations pre
sented before the Executive Commit
tee decided them to conduct the stu
dent vote next week.

A vote "Yes" on the proposition
will mean that for the sum of fifty
cents a student, Stanford will be able
to preserve the Daily Palo Alto in
position to live up to its present high
standards which make it rate with
the leading college dailies of the
country. It will mean that the United
Press service, which furnishes the
happenings of the day in world news
to the campus, will continue of be
a distinguishing feature of the Daily
Palo Alto. There is no afternoon
afternoon news service that reaches
the campus except through the Daily
Palo Alto and the United Press branch
of the Daily forms a valuable supple
ment to the world news carried in the
morning San Francisco papers.

At the present rate the Daily gets
50 cents a quarter from each student.
That makes a total rate of $1.50 a
year. The publications of other Coast
universities all get larger amounts
than this and from much larger stu
dent bodies. For instance, the Ore
gon Daily Emeiald gets $2.25 a year
from each of the 3500 students attend
ing the University of Oregon. The
Daily so far has been able to compete
with these other better favored pub
lications and cover itself with a good
deal of credit. That will be impossible
ofter this quarter, however, unless the
resolution is passed Wednesday.

If the "No's" should carry the vote
on the other hand, it would mean that
beginning next quarter the Daily Palo
Alto would have to appear as a small
four-column paper, stripped of all its
distinctive features. Continuing at
anything near the present size of the
paper would be a financial impossi
bility unless the students vote to give
the additional fifty cents. The pres
ent rate of $1.50 a year will not allow
the Daily to continue publication of
any paper larger in size than that of
the average high school paper.
