# A 						HIGH SCHOOL OR UNIVERSITY "DAILY"
## 
### 
The financial affairs of The Daily Palo Alto are at a crisis. Either
more money must be secured from the students in the form of 50 cents
added to the registration fee'or the paper will be forced to reduce to
four-columns or suspend publication. The question is vital, and de
mands the immediate attention of each Stanford man and woman.
Since the first of the quarter, The Daily has gone in the hole to the
extent of $250, and each issue sinks the paper in deeper. The situation
is due in no way to the present business management. The price of
paper has gone up 200 per cent since June, and printer's wages have
jumped enormously. The total cost of printing one issue is 30 per cent
higher than k was last year. Advertising has slumped badly during the
last two months due to poor business conditions. When a depression
sets in, the first thing the merchant does is to cut his advertising appro
priation. National advertising agencies are having the same trouble, and
this condition is forcing newspapers to go out of business every day.
Every thing possible has been done to cut down expenses. The
circulation department has cut down each room in the Halls to
and the fraternity and sorority houses to three or four papers. The
editorial staff is practicing every economy that can be inaugurated with
out letting down the standards of the paper.
At present The Daily Palo Alto gets 50 cents from each student,
which is paid as part of the registration fee, making a total of $1.50 a
year. The Oregon Daily Emerald has a subscription price of $2.25
per year. The University Daily Kansan charges $3.50 a year; and The
Daily Nebraskan, $3.50 a year. These papers are published in universi
ties with student bodies numbering from 3,500 students to 8,000.
The Daily Palo Alto is published in a University with an enrolt
went of 2,400 students, and the paper is distributed for $1.50 a year.
The situation is clear. The Daily is working under a great disad
vantage even in normal times, and with the addition of abnormal cir
cumstances, the paper is faced by the alternatives of reducing to four
columns or ceasing publication. *
Passage of the proposition will give The Daily an additional 50
cents, making the total $1 per quarter. It will mean that Stanford will
continue to have a daily paper that serves as one of the best advertise
ments that the University has. A defeat of the measure will bring a
four-column high school paper, or perhaps no paper at all.
