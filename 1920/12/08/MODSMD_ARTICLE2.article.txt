# NEW COMEDIANS WILL APPEAR TONIGHT IN TWO FRENCH FARCES
## 
### 
The French farces, "Rosalie" and
"Les Femmes Fortes," to be given this
evening at 8 o'clock at the Women's
Clubhouse, will reveal two new come
dians. Alexander Briggs, '24, son of
Professor Briggs, is expected to be the
star of the evening. His work gains
polish through the fact that lie studied
for two years in France. Abigail Trist,
'22, has the lead in "Rosalie," and her
work demonstrates just how clever one
must be in order to appear a pcrfcct
fool.

Elizabeth Noyes, '22, as the tough and
hardened desert explorer, has a memor
able bit of character work. The name of
Sidney William Hawkins, '24, conceals
a young lady whose French pronuncia
tion is impeccable. She and Zelda Wick
ersham play the part of frivolous sisters.
Miss Wickersham develops new possi
bilities in the old game of flirtation.
Hester Proctor, '21, in the role of an
old-fashioned girl whose sweet ways and
quiet efficiency win the heart of the hero,
has the longest and most difficult role.
To Mary Wildtnan, '23, and Edna Wil
bur, '20, fall the ungrateful roles of
grotesque old women, whose characters
match their faces in hideousncss.

Peggy Goodnow, '20, plays opposite
Mr. Schwartz in the part of a petite
grande dame in the comedy "Rosalie."
Mr. Schwartz, as president of the
French Club, has taken complete charge
of the production of these farces, ana
coached the actors, as well as taking a
part himself.
Admission is free.
