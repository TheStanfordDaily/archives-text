# ON THE CAMPUS
## 
### 
It will be a surprise to many students to learn that they can get
neckties made to order at the price they now pay for machine-made ties.
It is a known fact among correct dressers that a hand-made tie has it
all over the ordinary kind both in looks and wear.
A representative is ON THE CAMPUS in a position to render
personal service to the individual taste of those who want the correct
cravat. Over one hundred Stanford students have availed themselves
of this privilege.
For yourself; for a Christmas gift; see D. C. Heger's Art Neckwear.
See the material and the workmanship. Over three hundred and fifty
patterns and colors to choose from and a great variety of shapes in
both narrow and wide ties. Also tailor-made shirts. James Delkin,
Room 11, Sequoia. Orders promptly filled—personally delivered or
sent parcel post.—Advt.
