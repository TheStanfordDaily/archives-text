# PROFESSOR TREAT IS AN AUTHORITY ON FAR EAST
## 
### 
An enviable acquaintanceship with
the students, a complete mastery of
his work, and grownig popularity in
the University make Payson J. Treat,
professor of history, a notable and
well-loved figure here at Stanford,
while his sympathy with the down
trodden peoples of the Far East, and
the great vogue which his lectures
have attained, put him in the front
ranks of history scholars everywhere.
Professor Treat was born in New
York. Here he started to prepare
for the law, but while at college he
came under the influence of a very
brilliant history professor, Max Fer
rand, and abandoned the pursuit of
things legal, for the study of history.
He graduated from Wesleyan Univer
sity in Connecticut in 1900, took his
A. M. at Columbia in 1903, and his
Ph.D. at Stanford in 1910. After
graduating from Wesleyan, Professor
Treat taught history in Barnard Col
lege for three years.
In 1905 Treat came to Stanford as
a history instructor. He was given
a professorship in history here in 1910.
His especial interest in Far Eastern
affairs developed when Stanford de
cided to give instruction in this sub
ject in 1905. Immediately after the
earthquake, Professor Treat went on
a tour of the world, spending the
majority of his time in India, China,
Australia and Japan. He visited these
countries for further study again in
1912.
Interest in student activities has
cliaracterizen Professor Treat's atti
tude at Stanford, and the students
have not failed to recognize and ap
preciate this interest. He is a mem

ber of Press Club of Sigma Sigma,
now Skull and Snakes, and the Snake
and Key, whioh is no longer here. His
fraternity is Alpha Delta Phi and he
is also a Phi Beta Kappa. Professor
Treat's interest in campus affairs has
extended even to the women, or rather
to one woman, and in 1909 he married
Miss Jesoie McGilvray, a Stanford
graduate, whom he met here.
Professor Treat has been signally
honored, by being asked to give lec
ture courses in several of the great
universities. In 1916, he gave the
Stanford Lecture coure in Political
Science, at the University of Cali
fornia; in 1917, he gave the Albert
Shaw lectures at John Hopkins, and
he was also given a course at Yale.
Membership in several Asiatic so
cieties, as well is in American associ
ations, show the esteem in which
Professor Treat is held. He is a fel
low in the American Geographical So
ciety, and a member of the American
Historical Association, the American
Political Science Association, the Asi
atic Society of Japan, and the Chinese
Sociological and Political Science As
sociation.
As an author, Professor Treat is be
coming well-known as a contributor
to several magazines as well as for
the two books he has written. In
1910', he wrote "The National Land
Systfim (1778-1820)", and in 1917 the
"Early Development of Relations Be
tween the United States and Japan
(1853-1865)". He is contributing
