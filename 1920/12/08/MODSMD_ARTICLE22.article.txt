# PALACE ORCHESTRA TO PLAY ON CAMPUS FOR ENCINA DANCE
## 
### 
Friday evening the famous Palace
Hotel Orchestra will be heard on the
campus. Encina Club has just receiv
ed word from San Francisco that the
orchestra has consented to play at the
Club dance on the evening of Decem
ber 10.
The appearance of the Palace Or
chestra Saturday will be the first time
in years that it has played on the
campus. A number of attempts have
been previously made to secure the
musicians for a Stanford dance, but
the numerous engagements of the or
chestra have delayed a Stanford en
gagement.
Under the leadership of Gene Rose,
the pianist, the Rose Room musicians
have attained the enviable reputation
of being one of the most popular hotel
orchestras in the West. Frequent at
tempts are made to secure the synco
paters for engagements outside of San
Francisco but the Stanford appearance
is one of the few times that the
Palace Orchestra has played away
from the bay cities.
The best saxaphone player in San
Francisco, Beban, is scheduled to be
among thase playing on the campus
Friday evening. Though Beban will
shortly join Art Hickman's Orchestra
he will play with the Palace musici
ans Friday. Circellia, Sausedo. Mug
gy, Stafford and other noted players
are included in the Rose Room Or
chestra.
