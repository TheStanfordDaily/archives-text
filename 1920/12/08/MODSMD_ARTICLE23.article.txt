Prolonged supplication on the part of
ye "Sparks" ed. hath gained scant re
sponse from ye students of elementary
humor. Be it known, therefore, that
dreaded smoke-ups threaten 100 per
cent of aforesaid students. To con
tribute is not the question. It is WHY
NOT?
Hence, let us resume the day's study
of the text. Bolgie will recite for us
first. Pray begin, Bolgie.

A SYNCOPATED SYNOPSIS
Entrance fee,
Enrollment card,
Daily lesson,
Study hard.
Mid-quarter exes,
Smoke-up in mail,
Sureshot sign,
You're gonna fail.
End-quarter comes,
Awful scare,
First a zero,
Then the air.
—Bolgie.
* * *
Simple Sam solemnly states that
he's off this place for the rest of the
quarter. Yeah, they tied th' can to
him.
* * *
A FLYTRAP
Cup in hand, by the cider press,
Suzanne stood drinking cider,
A fly flew up and fell within,
And now the fly's inside 'er.
Hi Price declares that he is sure
heart and soul with the San Fran
cisco firm which advertises, "We stand
behind our beds."
* * *
A FORENSIC MOVE
List to me well while I relate,
A most fictitious fable;
The speaker raised his hand —then
laid
The motion on the table.
—Horse Marine.
* * *
If you can't follow your own rules,
try your nose a while.
* • *
Samp's son —I hear yer uncle lost
all his popularity since he got his new
teeth.
Simp's son —Yeah, he's making a
lot of falce impressions.
I —Hiccup Hogan.
