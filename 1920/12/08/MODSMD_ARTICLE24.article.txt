# MANY EXPERTS PICK 'SWEDE' RIGHTER ON ALL-COAST ELEVEN
## 
### 
The season for picking mythical
all-Coast football teams is with us
again. Sport writers, coaches, offici
als, and everybody else who knows
or thinks he knows something about
football have cxercised the inalien
able right to pick an all-Coast.eleven
at the close of the footbal season.
"Swede" Righter is the Stanford
man who has been picked most often
for the first team. The majority of
the experts have placed him at center
in their selection. Adams at end, Levy
and Cravens at guard, Deems and
Pershing as tackles, are other Cardi
nal men who have been given first
and second positions in the line.
"Dink" Templeton, is the only Stan
ford man who has been mentioned for
the backfield. Several have picked
him for the first team while he has
been the choice of a number of the
pickers for the second squad.
"Hub" Huebel, who acted is an of
ficial in a number of games this year,
picked Righter for center on his first
team. His all-round work earned him
the place, often going out of his pro
per territory to tackle a man, he said.
That location has something to do
with the selection is shown by the
team which a Portland sporting writer
picked. Four members of his first
team were University of Oregon men
while in this locality only one Ore
gon man, Bill Steers, was consistently
considered good enough for a place
on the first team.
Coaches are naturally also some
what partisan in their selection. Andy
Smith, the Bruin mentor, picked his
first team completely from his varsity.
Boles Rosenthal, the California line
coach, picked all but several of his
own men for his first team.
Coach Walter Powell picked five of
his men for positions on the all-
Coast team. He chose Adams for one
of his ends. Pershing is his choice
for a tackle position, while Levy was
chosen as a guard. Righter was given
the center .position.
In the backfield Powell picked
Templeton at half back.
Jack James, sporting editor of the
Examiner, awarded Righter a place on
his first team. He mentionad Deems
as a tackle in his second choice.
Righter was awarded first place by
Ralph Marx, football official) in his
selection. Templeton and Adams are
given places on his second choice.
Walter Camp won't pick his all-
American eleven until after the Cali
fornia-Ohio State fray in Pasadena on
New Year's Day. There is a strong
possibility that California will be rep
resented on this team this year.
