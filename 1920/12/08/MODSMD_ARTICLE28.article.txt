# SENIORS REQUESTED TO SUBMIT COLLEGE RECORDS FOR QUAD
## 
### 
A call for Senior Records has been
issued by Ross Fisher, '22, Editor of
the Quad. Fisher has placed a box
on the outside of the Quad office in
the Administration Building in which
any senior may drop the record of his
or her collegiate activities for publi
cation in the Senior Class Section of
the 1922 Quad. Seniors who will
graduate at Christmas or who will
not return next quarter are especially
requested to fill out their records and
deposit them in the box before the
close of the quarter.
Arrangements have been completed
at Davey's for the immediate photo
graphing of the members of the so
rority and fraternity houses. Mem
bers from only three sorority houses
have reported to Davy's to be photo
graphed for their house pictures. In
order to make the group picture com
plete, the Quad desires that any house
member who is not planning to be
back next quarter be photographed
within the next two weeks. The early
completion of the taking of the group
pictures will greatly facilitate later
work on the Quad, Fisher states, and
the co-operation of all of the houses
is asked.
The bulk of the Junior Class pic
tures must be taken this quarter in
order to accurately estimate the size
of the section necessary for the third
year pictures. Over two hundred
juniors have had their pictures taken,
reports Davey. Though the report
that the section would be closed this
quarter was erroneous,. Editor Fisher
warns the juniors that little time
would b 1 - allowed for the final photo
graphing after the Christmas vacation.
