(• The tirst annual report of the Stan
ly ford Home for Convalescent Children
£ shows a complete fulfillment of the
|. dream of Dr. Gardner, president of the
jj Board of Directors, to see the "poor
j| little sick and crippled kiddies of the
!• Stanford Hospital Clinics share our
£ country life, see real cows and drink
1. honest-to-goodness milk out of a real
j» dairy." Many years ago the chaplain of
I* the University established the Campus
P Auxiliary to the Stanford Clinics with
the aim to help Mrs. Barnett in her
work as the Clinics' social service
worker. This help consisted of a
monthly contribution in money, gifts of
clothes, Christmas cheer, and personal
service by college students.
The next step was the establishment
of a summer camp for sick and crippled
children, financed by a Palo Alto com
mittee. For two years 120 youngsters
came to Stanford in groups of twenty
for a summer outing. The need of a
permanent home became evident and the
Stanford Home for Convalescent Chil
dren, now located in the old Stanford
residence, was founded. The ideal sit
uation of the home for such a charity,
the help to the home by the Board of
i Trustees of the University and the con
scientious devotion in the work of the
house committee under Mrs. Payson J.
Treat, have been important factors in
making the establishment and work of
the Home a success. The president of
the Clinics Auxiliary lauds the work
of the Convalescent Home in her annual
report, saying: "The Stanford Home
for Convalescent Children has been a
' valuable aid to our work, and last year
' approximately three-fourths of those at
the Home were our children. Mrs. Bar
nett reports that the children 'come back
not only physically fit, but with better
manners, better ideas of cleanliness," and
understanding of cooperation in the
home.' "
Through the efforts of Mrs. Timothy
' Hopkins the Endowment Committee has
• obtained $35,000 in one year, invested in
! good bonds, as shown by the committee
• report. It is a good record and the
' Home is truly the "outward and visible
I sign of the spirit of social service in
> the. hearts and minds of the students,
' faculty, and friends of Stanford Uni
| versity."
