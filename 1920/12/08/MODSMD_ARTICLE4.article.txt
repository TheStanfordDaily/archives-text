# $250,000 BY SEARLES WILL MAY GO TO U. C.
## 
### 
The University of California may get
$250,000 which,, by the will of the late
Edwin F. Searles, was to revert to that
institution should his will be contested.

Albert Victor Searles, a nephew,
started a contest suit, which was com
promised by George Walker, business
manager of the estate.

The University of California will base
its suit for $250,000 upon the contention
that the contest action of young Searles
resulted in an increase of his inherit
ance by $250,000 and ,although his case
did not come to court ,his action
amounted to a virtual contest of the
will.
