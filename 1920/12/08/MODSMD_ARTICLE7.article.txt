# RULES FOR PACIFIC COAST CONFERENCE COMPLETELY REVISED
## 
### 
Complete revision and rewording of
rules and resolutions governing the Pa
cific Coast Conference, with regard to
the 1921 football season, was effected in
the meeting held by Conference officials
November 29 and 30 in Berkeley.

The removal of the five-year clause
from the rule, allowing students to par
ticipate in intercollegiate athletics three
years during a given period, was the
most important change effected in the
regulations. By virtue of the new ruling
students may participate for three years
regardless of the time of registration,
providing, of course, all other Confer
ence rules are conformed to.

The clause governing eligibility of
athletes as to college credit requirements
has been changed from a basic require
ment of thirty hours to thirty-six.

The former agreement of the Confer
ence officials, requiring each team to play
a minimum of three conference games,
was changed at the meeting, making
four conference contests the minimum
requisite. Heretofore Northern teams
have played four games, while both
California squads were handicapped in
percentage by being scheduled for oniy
three.
Seven contests are scheduled to be
played on the Stanford Turf next year,
including three conference games. Ore
gon University and O. A. C. will meet
the Cardinal eleven on its home field,
and the Big Game will finish the season.

It is probable that Stanford will play
Nevada on the local turf on the other
wise open date preceding the Big Game.
If the agreement is effected with Cali
fornia for the Bruins to play with U. S.
C. on the same date, the Nevada con
test is assured.
