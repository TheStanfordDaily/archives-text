development of his voice, entered the
Naples Conservatory, and studied
there for three years. His Italian
debut was made at age of 22, and
his American onely six years later,
in 1908. He at once took his place
as one of the first-rank stars of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, and his
concert successes have been equally
striking.
