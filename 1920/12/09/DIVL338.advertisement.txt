MUR&D
THE TURKISH
Mrs. Fox was bragging one day
about the large number of her
cubs.
"How many cubs do you bring
into the world at one time ? she
asked the LIONESS
"Only ONE, "replied the Lioness
—'' hut it's a LION !
MURADS COST 20 CENTS
FOR A BOX OF 10
BUT THEY'RE MURADS
MURADS would be lower
priced if we left out all or part of
the Ioof* Turkish tobaccos of the
purest and best varieties grown —
or if we substituted inferior grades
of Turkish tobacco
But they wouldn't be MURADS
—they'd only be Foxes!
"Judge for Yourself—! "
