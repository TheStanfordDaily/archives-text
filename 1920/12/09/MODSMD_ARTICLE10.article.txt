## California Representatives Blames Demagogues For Attitude of the Japanese 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 9.â€”'"Re
lations between the United States and
Japan have been brought to the pres
ent unsettled state by the Japanese
agitators and demogogues who are
seeking t ostir up hatred against this
country," representative Julius Kahn,
of California, declared in a speech
before the House tody. He warned
that the continual activity on the part
of Japanese agitators might lead to
war between the two countries.
"The people of the Pacific Coast ob
ject only to large numbers of Japanese
laborers coming to their state but not
to professional men, financiers, mer
chants or students," Kahn added.
Not Racial Question
Declaring that the question is not
one of racial prejudice, Kahn said,
"that one of the difficulties of the
whole situation is the attitude of the
people of the Coast as it is misrepre
sented by the demogogues in Japan."
Japanese publicists, agitators and poli
ticians seem to think that our objec
tions is racial. We do not consider
the Japanese inferior to the white
man but the habits and customs of
the laboring class make the Japanese
laborers impossible of assimilation in
the western states."
United States and Japanese, Kahn said
"As to the talk of war between the
"I know it is the earnest and patri
otic hope of every patriotic American
citizen that peace between the two
countries may be perpetual. But I say
in all candidness that if the Japanese
demogogues and politicians and agi
tators want war with the United
States they will be the ones to bring
it about.
