# NATIONAL TENNIS 'CHAMPS' TO EXHIBIT HERE ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
Si xtennis champions will exhibit here
Saturday afternoon on the Encina
courts. The men are Wallace Bates,
California state champion for 1919;
Robert and Howard Kinsey, holders ot
the Pacific Coast doubles title for the
last three years; Clarence "Peck" Griffin,
present national doubles champion and
fifth in national standing for the past
season; Willis Davis, champion of the
Pacific Coast singles and runner-up Tff
the national doubles, and Carl Gardner,
former national doubles champion. Gard
ner is a veteran o fthe game and still
plays a smashing game.
Wallace Bates last year went East to
represent the statd in the national
matches and made an excellent showing.
He is considered as one of the strongest
"comers" in the game.
There is doubt whether any of the
Stanford tennis players will meet the
jnen in the matches Saturday. The
Stanford team is not at its best so early
in the season and would not show to
good advantage.
A1 lstyles of tennis will be demon
strated by the players, as each one of
the men is anexpert in his particular
style of play. The Kinseys will play two
of the other men in an exhibition dou
bles match, and then there will be sev
eral sets of singles.
