Must Keep up Standard
"Chappie casts away his Hammer

this campaign. The Daily must keep
up the standard of other college pa
pers on the Pacific Coast. I am ex
pressing the sentiment of Hammer and

Coffin by heartily endorsing this cam

Press Club Stands
Behind Amendment
The daily paper is the barometer
by which a college is judged by other
colleges and high schools. If the stan
dards of the Daily Palo Alto are allow
ed to fall it will reflect on the stand
ing of Stanford. To defeat the Daily
Palo Alto amendment would be a blow
to our prestige from which we would
be long in recovering.
R .W. KENNY,
' President, Press Club.
Theta Sigma Phi Will
Support Daily Campaign
The present high standing of the
Daily Palo Alto must be maintained.
Any digression from the existing
standard will tend to lower the ranks
nf (he University in the realm of col
lege journalism. The members of
Theta Sigma Phi will lend every sup
port to the campaign.
(Signed) KIRBY INGOLDSBY, *21.
