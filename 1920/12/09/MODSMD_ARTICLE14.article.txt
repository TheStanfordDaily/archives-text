# "DAILY MUST GO FORWARD" IS SLOGAN OF CAMPAIGN TO PASS FUNDS MEASURE
## Failure to Pass Proposal Means Reduction or Abolition of University Paper 
### Jessee E. Thrash, '21 
"Forward not backward! The Daily
Palo Alto must keep pace with Stan
ford." This was the sentiment expressed
this afternoon by the presidents of the
live campus journalistic societies in stat
ing the position of their respective
organizations in the drive for Daily Palo
Alto funds.
Press Club, Sigma Delta Chi, Ham
mer and Coffin, Theta Sigma Phi, and
the American Journalists' Association
all went on record today as supporting
the campaign for the Daily Palo Alto.
In giving out statements the presidents
of these organizations expressed the
imperative need of keeping the Daily up
to standard.
Chappie Lays Down Hammer
and Backs Campaign
In expressing the sentiments of Ham
mer and Coffin and the Chaparral staff,
Arthur Harzfeld, '20, editor of the
Chaparral, pledged the Chappies to back
the proposition. "Chappie casts away his
hammer and bares his arms for real
effort in this campaign," Harzfeld saia
today. "By all means, the Daily must
keep up to the standards of other col
lege papers on the Pacific Coast."
Indications today were that almost
without exception every student and
organization connected with campus
journalism was out to put over the
Daily's drive for more student support,
is the Barometer of
of Our College Life
"The college daily is the barometer
of our college life and the yardstick
by which we are measured by other col
leges and high schools," declared Rob
ert W. Kenny, '21, editor of the Pic
torial and president of Press Club, m
giving out a statement on the campaign.
"The standards of the Daily Palo Atlo
must reflect the standards of Stanford."
Journalistic Fraternities
See Need for Immediate Action
Endorsement of the campaign was
made today by Sigma Delta Chi, the
men's honorary journalistic fraternity,
and by Theta Sigma Phi, the women's
honorary journalistic fraternity.
Sigma Delta Chi, at its meeting
Wednesday night, took action favoring
the proposition and pledged its members
to use all their influence in putting it
over by a big vote. Their action was
formally expressed in a statement today
by Dan Evans, president of the fra
ternity.
Kirby Ingolbsy, '21. issued a state
ment for Theta Sigma Phi favoring the
movement to keep the Daily up to the
standard of other papers on the coast.
The Stanford Chapter of the Amer
ican Journalists' Association also went

on record, through its executive, as be
ing behind the campaign for additional
Daily Palo Alto funds.
"Stanford has always been proud of
its leadership in college daily journalism
and the campus community is eager to
have the standards of completeness and
excellence maintained. The Stanford
Chapter of the American Journalists'
Association realizes that unless the Daily
Palo Alto receives more money it must
reduce its service, and therefore en
dorses the movement to give it in
creased resources," said Everett W.
Smith, chairman of the American Jour
nalists' Association.
Daily Palo Alto in
Peculiar Financial Situation
The Daily Palo Alto is perhaps the
most unfavorably situated college news
paper on the Pacific Coast in regards
to advertising. As a first-class college
Daily in a small town, and supported by
a relatively small student body, it is
faced with the necessity of drawing most
of its advertising from Palo Alto.
Erroneous criticism has at times been
thrown on the Daily Palo Alto manage
ment because of its financial situation.
The facts are these: (1) Two-thirds of
the "Daily's advertising must come from
Palo Alto. (2) The paper is now carry
ing the maximum amount of advertising
that a paper of its size can carry. Local
or national news of importance is often
thrown out because of lack of editorial
space.
Advertising Rates Cannot
Be Raised Any Higher
To the casual observer the solution
seems easy. Why not increase the reve
nues of the paper by raising the adver
tising rates? This is just the snag on
which the Daily management is now*
hung. This is point three of the finan
cial analysis. (3) It is impossible to
raise advertising rates on the Daily any
higher.
The reason for this being simply that
the Daily Palo Alto is competing with
the Daily Palo Alto Times in the ad
vertising field in Palo Alto, and cannot
go very much higher than the Times in
advertising rates.
The buying power of this community
is no greater than that covered by the
circulation of the Times, and the Palo
Alto business men will not take adver
tising here at higher rates than in the
other local paper.
The only solution to the problem
therefore is to increase the revenues of
the Daily Palo Alto by a slight raise in
tlie subscription rates. This proposition
must go through at the polls next
Wednesday or the Daily must go back
ward.
