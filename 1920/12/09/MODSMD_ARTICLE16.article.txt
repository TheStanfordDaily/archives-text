# BAD FEELING

### 
Quite a blow was delivered to the Pacific Coast Conference, and
its very existence threatened when the U. S. C. Trojan announced the
other day that the Conference is doomed by its action in refusing" the
University of Southern California admittance. According to the latest
reports since the issuance of the threat, the Conference is still in exist
ence and hopes to live a long life.
When the U. S. C. request was refused by the Conference officials
logical reasons were pointed out for the refusal. There was no inten
tion on the part of the Conference to deliberately "spite" the southern
ers, and this was made clear in the report which was issued after the
meeting. The scholarship of the University of Southern California was
recognized as high enough to meet the Conference requirements. The
only grounds on which the petition was turned down were distance and
expense, and it was explained why these two factors were especially im
portant at present. It was also stated that in a short time the Confer
ence would be in a position to accept the Trojans into the fold.
Instead of accepting the action with good grace, the southerners,
through the U. S. C. Trojan, have expressed their feelings in rather a
strong way. This outburst will hardly help them when the time comes
for the University of Southern California to petition again.
