# "PICTORIAL" EDITORIAL HITS HONOR SOCIETIES
## College Women and Marriage By an Anonymous Writer is Sensation of the Month 
### 
The last word on the Daily Palo Alto
amendment campaign will appear in an
article in the Pictorial, which will be
on sale on the Quad next Wednesday,
election day. The article entitled "More
Money or ?" was written by E. E.
Crowe, '21, editor of the Daily, and con
tains an illuminating summary of all the
points in favor of the raise in subscrip
tion prices.
"Ye College Pranke" is the title of
an article by K. N. Stewart, '23, which
considers from a critical viewpoint the
collegiate activities of the typical col
legian. Stewart traces the history of
the college prank from the days hack
in Columbus' time, when the first col
lege student greased the first car track.
He goes into the psychological reasons
for the prank, and has developed a cycle
theory of what happens to all college
traditions in time.
Campus honor societies come in for
their share of criticism in the December
Pictorial. Resides a critical article by
Miss Ellen Calhoun, '20, entitled "Hon
ors Easy," there is an editorial on the
same subject which gives evidence in
the advance copy of causing a local sen
sation on its appearance. One campus
honor society has been singled out as
the object of its attack and its short
comings have been pointed out by the
editor in no uncertain terms. A discus
sion of the Skull and Keys affair at
California and its relation to Stanford is
one of the topics of the editorial.
"College Women and Marriage," an
article by an anonymous writer, is prob
ably the most sensational feature of this
month's issue. Marriage is the theme
of the articlc and the subject is treated
in such a way that it will be read with
interest, if not with pleasure, by cam
pus tnen and women.
