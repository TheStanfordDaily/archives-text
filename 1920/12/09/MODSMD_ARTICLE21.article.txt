# "Lens and Plate" Is Name of New Honor Photographers' Club
## 
### 
Lens and Plate, the new campus
camera society, formally adopted its con
stitution and took its place among the
other active honor societies at a meeting
held Tuesday in the Men's Union. Club
rooms were leased in the Students'
Union and preparation for active work
in photographic activities made.
According to the officials of the club,
Stark Draper, president, Al. Carey, vice
president, and Ken Ritchie, secretary
treasurer, the object of Lens and Plate,
which caused the honor society to be
formed among the pictorial enthusiasts,
is to promote interest and knowledge in
the art and science of photography.
Dark rooms for plate and film work,
as well as a social room, are now in
the process of being fitted out in the
basement of the Union. Here will be
stored all the chemicals and camera
literature that any film artist could de
sire. The products of the members of
the society are to be seen in the various
Stanford publications.
Lens and Plate is a restricted organ
ization, only those students who have
shown distinctive work in the photog
rapher's field are to be voted in. Mem
bership in this organization will be a
reward for special activity in photo
graphic work, and members will be ad
mitted in much the same way as they
arc in other honor societies, namely, as
a reward of prominence in that line.
