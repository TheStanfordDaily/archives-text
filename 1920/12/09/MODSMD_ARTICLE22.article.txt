It pains ye ed. muchly to inform the
perusers of this page that the pupils vi
elementary humor are responding to his
S. O. S. very much as a burnt child to
the fire. So-called and aforesaid humor
can scarcely maintain an unabated flow
from one or trvo pens like weenies out
of a sausage mill. Ye jokesmith zvaveth
the zvhite flag. His optimism hath been
knocked for a loop. Hellup, before the
white flag is dyed black and hung over
his desk.

Some people have a habit
Of listening for the bell,
They twist their necks
And flunk the ex
And now they're S. O. L.

"A hearse! A hearse! My kingdom
for a hearse!" cried the stiff.

80lt —That eucaluptus tree reminds
me of a dog with a cold.
Dolt —Why so?

PUGILISTIC WIZARDS
Two gents engaged in hot debate; ....
Remarks they made were bold;
And though they both were very hot,
They knocked each other cold.
It was only two weeks later
When both gained great renown,
They met—and went up in the air,
Then knocked each other down.
—Woof, Woof.

"To dew or not to dew, that is the
question," quoth Nature. This inde
cision is awful. She'd oughta know
weather to do it or not.
The merits of a proposed member
of a certain club were being discussed
pro and con. Said one who favored
the admission of the new man, "Every
body ought to know him. He's been
here at least twenty times."
"Present him with a board bill," was
the facetious response.

There was a young man from Topeka,
Who drank his homebrew from a
beakah,
He was soon apprehended,
His joy thereby ended;
And the Prohi's all shouted, "Eureka."

Mr. Jumping Jack (at dance) —Hey,
get in step. What's the matter with
you?
Mrs. J. J. —Can't help it. I've got
my wires crossed.
