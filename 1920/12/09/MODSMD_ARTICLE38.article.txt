# COLLECTION OF OIL PAINTINGS INCLUDED IN DECEMBER EXHIBIT
## 
### 
Three new exhibits are being shown
at the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery for the month of December: A
collection of oil paintings from the brush
of Mrs. J. V. Cannon of Berkeley, re
cently a resident of Palo Alto; a series
of French war posters and cartoons,
Qnd samples of art done in various high
schools throughout the United States.
The paintings of Mrs. Cannon are
predominantly landscapes with a few
still-lifes and figure groups. They are
particularly interesting, aside from their
artistic merit, in that most of them are
California scenes at Monterey, Poini
Lobos, and Montara, including one of
the Stanford Quadrangle. Many of the
landscapes are remarkably natural in
color and composition, especially one of
the larger paintings of Monterey Bay.
1 he French posters and cartoons arc
samples of the best which were pro
duced during the war and played an
important part in keeping up the morale
of the French people and furthering re
lief measures and government loans.
Some are stirring appeals to patriotism,
others are droll caricatures of the poilu
in action, and others depict the pathos
and tragedy of war's hideous reality.
The high school art is, for the most
part, of the commercial type, designs
for rugs, book covers, lamp shades, anil
similar articles. A number of drawings
for advertisements are especially good
The exhibit is interesting chicfiy as
specimens of the work which high school
students are capable of doing, although
much of it might well have been done
by professionals.
These exhibits will be shown at the
Art Gallery throughout the month of
December, in addition to the paintings
belonging to the Thomas Welton Stan
ford collection.
