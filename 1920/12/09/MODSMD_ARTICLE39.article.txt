# RESULTS OF FIRST MASQUERS TRYOUTS ANNOUNCED TODAY
## 
###

in the Assembly Hall yesterday after
noon and evening. Due to the large cast
of the play of eighteen characters, pre
liminary tryouts were held again this
afternoon, and will be held again tomor
row at 1 o'clock in the Assembly Hall
for any new people who have not so far
been able to tryout. Those who passed
the preliminaries will appear for second
tryouts at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
The play to be produced, though
placed in the mid-Victorian period, is
written by a modern playwright and is
full of humor and clever lines. It has
an atmosphere of the theater, and the

the most unique things about the play
is that the last act is set on the bare
stage and is a rehearsal scene. The

Those who have tried out before and
have not been cast for parts in other
plays should not be discouraged, Coach
