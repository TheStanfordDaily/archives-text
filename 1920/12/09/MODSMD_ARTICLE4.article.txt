# ZETA PSI, EL CAMPO, CHI PSI WIN GAMES
## Close Contests Are Developed By Teams in Third Round of Intramural Basketball 
### 
The end of the third round of the
intramural basketball games, played
yesterday, found Zeta Psi, Chi Psi, and
El Campo tied for the lead of League 3,
by virtue of their victories over the quin
tets of Sequoia 2nd, Sequoia Ist and
4th, and Theta Xi, respectively.
Zeta Psi downed the Sequoia 2nd
floor team, 10-4, after a close light. The
defensive work of both teams was good,
which accounts for the low score made.
Chi Psi had a fairly easy time in de
feating the Sequoia Ist and 4th team,
20-6. Wallace, playing for the Chi Psi
squad, was the individual star of the
game, caging 12 of the 20 points made by
his team.
El Campo was too strong for Theta
Xi and won, 18-7. Righter, the El
Campo center, was well covered by the
Theta Xis, and had difficulty in getting
free for shots.
This afternoon the schedule calls for
the teams of League 7 to do battle. Fed
eral Vocation Board plays Encina L.
3rd, Medics lock horns with Encina 4th,
and Flncina Basement is opposed to
Encina Bull Pen.
The schedule for Friday's games,
which are to be played by the teams in
League 1, is: Alpha Sigma Phi vs. Entre
Nous on Court 1, Breakers vs. Encina
W. Ist on Court 2, and Alpha Kappa
Lambda vs. Sequoia 3rd on Court 3.
