# CARDINAL SOCCERITES ESTABLISH NEW MARK
## No League Game Scheduled Until After the Holidays; Should, Increase Lead Soon 
### 
Resting up prior to the end-quarter
examinations, the soccer team has no
more games on its schedule until after
the Christmas vacation, excepting, of
course, those men chosen for the Stan
ford-California all-star team, who will
be busy getting in shape for the British
Columbia trip. Judging from the way
the team has been plowing through the
University and Club Soccer League so
far, the games coming after vacation
should put Stanford still further ahead
in the league leadership, a position which
it now holds securely.
This year's team will be surpassing
most previous records in having gone so
far without a single defeat, though the
soccer teams of former years have added
renown to Cardinal athletics. The soccer
team of 1913-14 won the series from
California by taking two games out of
three, tieing one. This victory gave
Stanford the Williamson trophy. Dur
ing the 1914-15 season California was
promptly downed in two contests by two
whitewash scores, and it was only after
a hard fight that the league leadership
finally went to the Celtics of San Fran
cisco. The 1915-16 machine, under Cap
tain Boyle, cleaned up on California
again and in addition finished the season
at the head of the soccer league. The
1917 IS season was marked by the first
defeat suffered by the Cardinal soccer
ites at the lifcnds of the Blue and Gold
for nine years, but at that, under the
able leadership of Captain Adams, the
series with California came out no woise
than'a tie, as Stanford won the return
game, and the season finished with Stan
ford again at the head of the league.
One reason that can be given for the
strong showing made by the soccer team
this year is in the number of veterans
of former seasons who-twe on the team.
Straus's, Clark, Gorman, Robinson,
Adams, Mendonca and Newland, all
members of last year's team, are play
ing this year, and work together to form
a sound foundation for the addition of
new material. Whatever may be the
main reason, it is certain that Coach
Maloney has built up one of the strong
est soccer teams that has ever repre
sented Stanfordâ€”and in the light of the
past records of the Cardinal teams that
saying means something.
