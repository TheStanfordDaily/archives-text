revenue and tariff laws must continue
for a year, Republican leaders of the
Jiouse agreed today after completing
preliminary plans for revision of these
two measures.
Representative Forensey, chairman of
the ways and means committee, today
said Congress would be showing un
usual speed if a Repubilcan revenue and
tariff law were on the statute books by
the end of nine months. He believes thai
at least nine months will be required in
the revision of the tariff.
Apparently Houston's suggestion for
the repeal of the excess profits tax is
the only one. upon which committee
members agree.
"The present income taxes are too
high and ought to be reduced as soon
as possible," he said.
Houston's proposal for a 10 per cent
tax on the undistributed profits of cor
porations met with favor.
Considerable opposition was expressed
to the proposal for a federal license on
automobiles and a tax of 2 cents a gal
lon on gasoline. Likewise, there was ob
jection to increasing the petty taxes,
such as on theater tickets, jewelry,
chewing gum, candy and the like.
