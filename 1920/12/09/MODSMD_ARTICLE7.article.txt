# POLAND IN NEED OF FOOD ASSERTS PALMER FULLER
## Assembly Speaker Says There Is Possibility of Another Bolshevik Drive on Nation 
### 
Another Bolshevik drive against Po
land is in prospect for next spring, ac
cording to W. Palmer Fuller, '10, in
his talk, "A Year in Poland," in the
Assembly Hall this morning.
"It was common talk in Warsaw as
early as last April," he said, "that the
program of the Bolsheviki called for a
drive against Poland in the summer of
1920. The next thing was to clean up
General Wrangel in the Crimea and
then another campaign against Poland
in 1921. The first two of these things
have come about according to the War
saw rumors, and it is possible that the
entire prediction will come true."
Fuller briefly sketched the history of
the country. Until the present time Po
land has been constantly under the
domination of Russia, who allowed it no
expansion. The country was merely used
as part of the Russian military strateg>
for the coming war with Germany, he
said.
According to the speaker, the worst
facts which have been published about
the general collapse of Russia are true.
Agents of the American Relief Admin
istration have investigated the situation
and have reported that there has been
a general social and economic collapse.
That Moscow and Petrograd are
closed cities is the information coming
from Russia. The great need of the
country is food. A soviet decree made
the sale of food illegal, but the des
perate situation in recent months forced
the government to wink at the illicit
sale, he declared. The peasant is the
only person in Russia who is well off.
As any surplus foodstuffs are ilable to
be requisitioned and paid for in soviet
rubles, which have little value, the peas
ant only raises enough for himself.
There was little fighting in connection
with Polish-Bolshevik warfare last sum
mer, contrary to reports in the United
States, the speaker declared.
"As the Bolsheviks advanced 375 miles
in forty days, you can see that there was
little actual fighting. The Poles had a
poor £taff, though the average Pole is a
good soldier, and they retreated con
stantly. It was only when General Wey
gand came from France and took charge
of the Polish army that the situation
was saved and the Russians driven
back."
That there is a hatred between the
Poles and Rusisans, irrespective of the
governments of the two countries, which
goes back hundreds of years, was the
assertion of Fuller. The Poles have al
ways been mistreated by the Russians
and have lived in mortal fear of them.
Polish industry was declared to be in
a ruined condition. Raw materials are
lacking and even if available the in
dustry would be seriously handicapped,
as the chief market of the Poles was
Russia, and this market no longer exists.
Because they never had a chance to
govern themselves before given inde
pendence by the Peace Conference, the
Polish people are incapable of ruling
themselves. In addition to the great
mass of illiterate people, the upper
classes were described as being imprac
tical.

Another Bolshevik drive against Po
land is in prospect for next spring, ac
cording to W. Palmer Fuller, '10, in
his talk, "A Year in Poland," in the
Assembly Hall this morning.
"It was common talk in Warsaw as
early as last April," he said, "that the
program of the Bolsheviki called for a
drive against Poland in the summer of
1920. The next thing was to clean up
General Wrangel in the Crimea and
then another campaign against Poland
in 1921. The first two of these things
have come about according to the War
saw rumors, and it is possible that the
entire prediction will come true."
Fuller briefly sketched the history of
the country. Until the present time Po
land has been constantly under the
domination of Russia, who allowed it no
expansion. The country was merely used
as part of the Russian military strateg>
for the coming war with Germany, he
said.
According to the speaker, the worst
facts which have been published about
the general collapse of Russia are true.
Agents of the American Relief Admin
istration have investigated the situation
and have reported that there has been
a general social and economic collapse.
That Moscow and Petrograd are
closed cities is the information coming
from Russia. The great need of the
country is food. A soviet decree made
the sale of food illegal, but the des
perate situation in recent months forced
the government to wink at the illicit
sale, he declared. The peasant is the
only person in Russia who is well off.
As any surplus foodstuffs are ilable to
be requisitioned and paid for in soviet
rubles, which have little value, the peas
ant only raises enough for himself.
There was little fighting in connection
with Polish-Bolshevik warfare last sum
mer, contrary to reports in the United
States, the speaker declared.
"As the Bolsheviks advanced 375 miles
in forty days, you can see that there was
little actual fighting. The Poles had a
poor £taff, though the average Pole is a
good soldier, and they retreated con
stantly. It was only when General Wey
gand came from France and took charge
of the Polish army that the situation
was saved and the Russians driven
back."
That there is a hatred between the
Poles and Rusisans, irrespective of the
governments of the two countries, which
