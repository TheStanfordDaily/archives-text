# "DAILY PALO ALTO" FACES PROBLEM OF DEFICIT AND RISING PRODUCTION COSTS
## Expenses of Publication Can Not Be Cut Any Lowers According to Student Manager 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto faces a problem not only of temporary deficit, but
of rising cost. The deficit of $250.00 to December Ist is not a fair indication of
the seriousness of the situation.
As tfcie year progresses advertising tightens up and expenses increase,
and the resulting deficit is bound to grow materially larger each months
Relief may be found only in a decrease in expenses, which means a smaller
paper, or an increase in income, which must come from the students.

An income of $2970 accrued to the
"Daily" before December Ist, including
Student Body subscriptions and ad
vertising. Expenses amounted to $3,-
220.00, leaving a deficit of $250.00 for
the two months.
This deficit exists notwithstanding
the fact that a profit was realized on
the "Daily" last year. The size of
the paper has been increased from
five short columns to six long columns
with a resultant doubling the amount
of type to be set each day. In ad
dition the cost of setting each line of
type has increased over last year.
Student Manager Says
Aid is Necessary
Student Manager Templeton after
examining the methods of conducting
the "Daily" stated his opinion that ex
penses cannot possibly be cut down
while the paper retains its present
size, and the aid from the students
is the only reasonable solution of the
problem.
Cost to Increase
Again in January
Not only is there a deficit at pres
ent, but definite increases in the cost
of printing are to go into effect in
January, when a raise in salaries will
be made. W. A. Friend, Manager of
the University Press, today estimated
that the new scale will raise the cost
of printing the Daily $125 each month.
Had this scale been in effect during
the present quarter the deficit would
now be $500, or would increase to
$(J25.00 at the end of the quarter on
the present basis.
It has been demonstrated by past
managers that the problem of manag
ing the Daily grows more difficult with
each succeeding quarter of the year.
The Fall Quarter is always the best,
and it wÂ£.s during this quarter that
most of the profits were made when
the paper was five columns in size.
Last year a profit of over $1,000 was
made on the "Daily," and less than
$100 mas made during the last quar
ter.
Ex-Graduate Manager
Gives View
Walter I. Ames, former manager of
the Daily Palo Alto and ex-Graduate
Manager of the University, today stat
ed, "1 want to see the Daily Palo Alto
the best college paper on the Pacific
Coast and the students should supply
any additional funds necessary to
meet the present emergency.
Keep the 'Daily' Intact
