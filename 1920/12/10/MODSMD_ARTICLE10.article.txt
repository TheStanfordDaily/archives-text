# "DAILY" BUSINESS MANAGER FAVORS FIFTY-CENT RAISE
## Wallace M. Davis, '21, Points to Reasons Why the Paper Should Have Financial Help 
### WALLACE M. DAVIS, '21 
The Daily Palo Alto, with its present
size and standards, will never be able
to operate profitably, even under the
most favorable business conditions,
without increased support from the Stu
dent Body. Stanford University, located
on "The Farm," is not economically sit
uated to be able to support a daily
newspaper of the quality of The Daily
Palo Alto without either a subsidy
from the University trustees or strong
financial support from the students
themselves. The location of the Univer
sity is a handicapâ€”there is not the ad
vertising field to draw on. Palo Alto,
where the Daily gets th? majority of its
advertising, is the smallest university
town on the coast.
The University of Washington Daily
is supported by a city of 400,000 and
the buying power pf 4,000 students. The
Oregon Emerald is printed in a town
of 20,000 and is a much less expensive
paper than The Daily Palo AJto. The
O. A. C. Barometer has a town of 15,-
000 to draw on and over 3,500 students
to contribute to its circulation, yet the
Barometer is issued only twice a week.
The Daily Californian is admirably sit
uated, with the merchants of Berkeley,
Oakland, and San Francisco vieing foi
the trade of the 10,000 students of the
State University. The Daily Californian,
however, is only slightly larger than the
present edition of The Daily Palo Alto.
And the Trojan of the University of
Southern California is printed in the
largest city on the coast.
Yet The Daily Palo Alto, competing
with these papers and putting out a
Daily fit to uphold the standards and
prestige of Stanford, draws the majoi
ity of its financial support from a town
of less than 6,000.
From a purely economical viewpoint
the Situation of Stanford University,
removed from great business centers,
does not substantiate more than a fou.
or five-column paper. And if Stanford
wishes to honorably compete with other
college publications it must have at least
as much, if not more, financial support
from its Student Body than is given the
publications in other colleges.
Keep the 'Daily' Intact
