# SOCCER TEAM TO MEET OYMPICS IN LEAGUE GAME
## Northern Trip Is Postponed; Game With Clubmen Tomorrow is Crucial Contest 
### 
The proposed trip to British Colum
bia by an all star soccer team from
Stanford and California lias been called
off for the present and will not take
place until spring. This was decided
yesterday, when representatives of the
two sections agreed that for several
reasons it would be best to postpone
the invasion. The rugby team is also tt
make a trip to British Columbia during
vacation, and it was decided that it
would be better for both teams not to
go up at the same time, as they would
prove to be counter attractions and
would not have the drawing power
otherwise possible.
TlnA-reason for the postponement ot
the soccer instead of the rugby inva
sion lies in the fact that conditions wih
be much better suited for soccer in the
spring. Rugby is in its prime in British
Columbia just now, while soccer does
not come into its own until the spring,
when weather conditions will be much
better for the sport. Wet weather is
especially ruinous for a soccer game, as
the forwards, and the backfield, too,
cannot do effective kicking with a wad
of mud sticking to their shoes.
In view of this postponement an im
portant league game will be played 011
the local turf tomorrow with the Olym
pic Club. This game, a regular league
affray, was not scheduled to take place
until January 15, but as neither the
Olympic Club or the Cardinal soccerites
had a game on for tomorrow, it
agreed to advance the league game to
the present date.
If Stanford wins this game, the
league leadership is cinched. Therefoie
it can very easily be predicted that u
liercc struggle will be provided, espe
cially as the Olympic Club is now rest
ing in second place, only a few point 3
behind Stanford. The clubmen are send
ing down a much stronger team thaw
that which faced the Cardinals in the
last game, and, headed by Captain Gal
lagher, are anxious to get within striking
distance of the league leadership.
Coach Maloney wishes it announced
that all men who showed up last Satur
day, including Weller, who was not
eligible for the California game, are to
be ready for the Olympic game tomor
row. The lineup for the game will be
substantially the same as that which
faced California last Saturday, unless
Weller is placed at center forward. He
and Strauss are fighting it out for that
position.
The lineup: Newland, goal; Ander
son. right back; Adams, right back;
Wing, right* half; Robinson, center half;
Gorman,%left half; Mendonca, outside
right; Campbell, right; Strauss or Wel
ler, center forward; Peavy, inside left;
Clark, outside left.
