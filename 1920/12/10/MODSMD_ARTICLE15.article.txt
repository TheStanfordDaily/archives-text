# LAW AND ORDER
## 
### 
The State of California has allowed its honor to be outraged by
the action of the Santa Rosa, lynching party, and unless the leaders are
sought out and punished by the processes of law, this state will auto
matically place itself in the class with the semi-civilized peoples, and
with those Southern states where law and order is a fact only when the
state desires it to be so, and where the people take justice in their own
hands and exercise it as they see fit. If California is not to retrogress
to this stage, every effort must be made by the state authorities to see
that the officers of Sonoma County punish the guilty persons.
There is no doubt in the minds of everyone that the three men were
guilty. Every resident of this state undoubtedly wanted the men to be
punished to the extreme, but the vast majority of the people realize that
the state exists with complete power over its internal affairs, and it
has machinery to enforce its laws. When the laws of the state are vio
lated the offenders are subject to punishment, if proven guilty, and
simply because the crime happens to be one that causes a revulsion
of feeling within every normal-minded individual is no reason for a
group of citizens to take the authority of state upon themselves and
exact retribution. It is a return to the days of barbarism, when there
was no such thing as law and order. However, the State of California
is supposed to have sovereign power over its internal affairs, and it
must give concrete evidence that law and order exist.
