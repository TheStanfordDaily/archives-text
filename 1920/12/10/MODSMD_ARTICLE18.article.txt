## 
### 
With a record of participation in
every form of campus literary publi
cation during his undergraduate days
at Stanford and a wealth of practical
experience acquired from active news
paper service, Everett W. Smith Is
well qualified for his position as head
of the Journalism work of the Uni
versity.
Professor Smith was born in New
Bedford and received his early edu
cation in the New England States.
His family came to California in 1894
and he spent his senior year in the
San Diego High School. He entered
Stanford in 1895 and was intensely
interested in journalism and athletics.
In his senior year Professor Smith
was editor and business manager of
the Daily Palo Alto, at the same time,
as well as a member of the staffs of
the Sequoia, now Cardinal, the Quad,
and an instigator of the Chaparral,
which was founded in '00 by Bristow
Adams. "The Eucalyptus" was the
first title suggested for the comic ma
gazine when Smith and Adams worked
That" which is still employed in the
out the plan for it in '99 and the "Now
beginning of all Chappie editorials
was adopted from the rule of Pro
fessor Smith that all editorials in the
"Daily" beginning with those words
should be entirely obliterated.
Professor Smith was a distance run
ner and was captain of the track
team during his senior year. He held
the intercollegiate championship for
the mile, at that time.
Professor Smith received the degree
of Bachelor of Art in 1899 and went
to the "Chronicle" in San Francisco
as reporter. He worked to the posi
tion of coast editor on that paper,
then went to New York where he
served on several small papers be
fore being given a place with "The
Sun." Professor Smith attributes a
great deal of his practical experience
to the time spent with the Daily

News a paper owned by Frank Mun
sey, on which Smith had the unique
position oi' filling in for any man who
happened to be absent, from the city
editor to copy reader.
On one of his trips to the east Dr.
Jordan invited Professor Smith to
return to Stanford as an instructor
in English and journalism. He ac
cepted in 1910 and the present de
partment of journalism was installed
in the University.
Professor Smith has been engaged
in what are considered as the two
biggest educational endeavors ever at
tempted in the publicity line. The
first, which he took up after leaving
newspaper work in New York was
with the Conservation Commission of
the forestry service and the second
was with the Food Administration at
Washington, D. C., during the war.
Professor Smith volunteered his ser
vice in 1917 and was made chief of
the copy desk section for the admin
istration publicity, which consisted of
practically editing a paper of special
information. When the office of the
Food Administration closed in Wash
ington, Professor Smith went to New
York as chief of the publicity for
Hoover's American Relief Administra
tion. He returned to the University
after an absence of two years.

his students in newswriting. He was
married to May Hurlbut, '02, in 1908.

Alumnus, now the Illustrated Review
for seven years and is the founder and

of College news bureaus. At present
he is vice-president of the American
Association of Teachers of Journalism,

the National Association of American
Journalists and a member of the
Board of Athletic Control.
