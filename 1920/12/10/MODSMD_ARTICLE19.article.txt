NEW YORK, Dec. 10. — Percy
Houghton, founder of the "Harvard
football system," wants football re
vised.
The forward pass must be curbed,
he says,, or football will become a
combination of basketball and base
ball.
Houghton knows football, of course,
but other experts do not agree with
his fears for the future of the game.
Jack Wilce, founder of the system
that brought Ohio State from a medi
ocre position in the Ohio conference
of small colleges to the peak of the
"Big Ten" of the west, is a disciple
of the open game.
"The forward pass made football
what it is," he said here recently. "It
has removed the weight handicap suf
fered by small elevens, it has made a
less dangerous game and decreased in
juries, it has made it an interesting
game to watch and it has introduced
more intelligence into th« game."
To make radical changes in the for
ward pass rules would be to send the
game back into its primitive stages
and make weight rule again, he thinks.
Wilce, however, favors some slight
changes in the rules to overcome a
few advantages that the forward pass
now enjoys.
He suggests, for instance, that in
the case of interference with the re
ceiver of the pass instad of giving
the ball to the offended team where
the foul was committeed, to bring the
ball back to the point of play and in
flict a penalty of ten yards.
If any changes are made by the
rules committee this winter, Wilce
favors a rule requiring all players to
be numbered.
"Objections made by some coaches
that secrets of their system and trick
plays would become known with num
bers on their players are silly," he
said. "Ohio State was the only team
in the Western Conference to wear
numbers all season and we won the
championship. I admit that scouts
find their task easier when they have
numbers to follow, but it didn't hurt
us much.
"We think in Columbus that we
have a system as good as that of any
major university in the country. We
have as much to keep secret as any
other coaching staff, yet WE ARE
NOT SO SMALL THAT WE WILL
PUT OUR SYSTEM ABOVE THE IN
TEREST OF THE PUBLIC THAT
KEEPS THE GAME GOING. Regard
less of what other teams do and what
the rules committee may decide, we
are going to make our interest
ing to the public if we cah.
"Ohio State is going to build a mil
lion-dollar stadium, the largest and
finest in the world. We will need a
huge seating capacity because we are
making football fans in Ohio. The
baseball fan likes to sit in the grand
stand and figure the 'inside' of the
game—to study what is being done
and why it is being done. The real
football fan likes to do the same thing.
He doesn't just sit there and watch
the ball go up and down the field. He
likes to know what the quarterback
is trying to do and he is interested
to see how it is done. Without num
bers his task is too hard. With num
bers it is easy and he becomes a con
firmed football fan."
In the last four years, Ohio Stato
under the guidance of Wilce has lost
but one game, has won two western
conference championships and finished
second once. He developed Chic Har
ley, Pete Stinchcomb, Workman, Wil
laman, Pixley, Huffman, and some of
the greatest players in the Middle
West.
"Am I going to coach at Ohio State
next year? Well, I presume so. You
know out wfist we don't go through an
undefeated season and got a four-year
contract. Neither do we lose one
game and get canned. I haven't a
contract with Ohio State. I'm a mem
ber of the faculty, that's all," Wilce
said.

fered by small elevens, it has made a
less dangerous game and decreased in
juries, it has made it an interesting
game to watch and it has introduced
more intelligence into th« game."
To make radical changes in the for
ward pass rules would be to send the
game back into its primitive stages
and make weight rule again, he thinks.
Wilce, however, favors some slight
changes in the rules to overcome a
few advantages that the forward pass
now enjoys.
He suggests, for instance, that in
the case of interference with the re
ceiver of the pass instad of giving
the ball to the offended team where
the foul was committeed, to bring the
ball back to the point of play and in
flict a penalty of ten yards.
If any changes are made by the
rules committee this winter, Wilce
favors a rule requiring all players to
be numbered.
"Objections made by some coaches
that secrets of their system and trick
plays would become known with num
bers on their players are silly," he
said. "Ohio State was the only team
in the Western Conference to wear
numbers all season and we won the
championship. I admit that scouts
find their task easier when they have
numbers to follow, but it didn't hurt
us much.
"We think in Columbus that we
have a system as good as that of any
major university in the country. We
have as much to keep secret as any
other coaching staff, yet WE ARE
NOT SO SMALL THAT WE WILL
PUT OUR SYSTEM ABOVE THE IN
TEREST OF THE PUBLIC THAT
KEEPS THE GAME GOING. Regard
less of what other teams do and what
the rules committee may decide, we
are going to make our interest
ing to the public if we cah.
"Ohio State is going to build a mil
lion-dollar stadium, the largest and
finest in the world. We will need a
huge seating capacity because we are
making football fans in Ohio. The
baseball fan likes to sit in the grand
stand and figure the 'inside' of the
game—to study what is being done
and why it is being done. The real
football fan likes to do the same thing.
He doesn't just sit there and watch
the ball go up and down the field. He
likes to know what the quarterback
is trying to do and he is interested
to see how it is done. Without num
bers his task is too hard. With num
bers it is easy and he becomes a con
firmed football fan."
In the last four years, Ohio Stato
under the guidance of Wilce has lost
but one game, has won two western
conference championships and finished
second once. He developed Chic Har
ley, Pete Stinchcomb, Workman, Wil
laman, Pixley, Huffman, and some of
the greatest players in the Middle
West.
"Am I going to coach at Ohio State
next year? Well, I presume so. You
know out wfist we don't go through an
undefeated season and got a four-year
contract. Neither do we lose one
game and get canned. I haven't a
contract with Ohio State. I'm a mem
ber of the faculty, that's all," Wilce
said.

NEW YORK, Dec. 10. — Percy
Houghton, founder of the "Harvard
football system," wants football re
vised.
The forward pass must be curbed,
he says,, or football will become a
combination of basketball and base
ball.
Houghton knows football, of course,
but other experts do not agree with
his fears for the future of the game.
Jack Wilce, founder of the system
that brought Ohio State from a medi
ocre position in the Ohio conference
of small colleges to the peak of the
"Big Ten" of the west, is a disciple
of the open game.
"The forward pass made football
what it is," he said here recently. "It
has removed the weight handicap suf
fered by small elevens, it has made a
less dangerous game and decreased in
juries, it has made it an interesting

more intelligence into th« game."
