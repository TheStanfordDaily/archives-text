# PALACE ORCHESTRA TO PLAY FOR ENCINA 1920 FOOTBALL HOP
## 
### 
Rose Room musicians from the
Palace Hotel of San Francisco will
entertain the terpsichoreans of the
campus at the Encina Club dance this
evening. The famous orchestra is ex
pected to arrive on the campus late
this afternoon and will be the guests
of the clubmen tonight.
This evening's hop, the last campus
dance scheduled for the quarter, will
have the 1920 football squad as guests
of honor. Elaborate programs have
been printed containing the names
of the gridiron stars. The Decoration
Committee has worked out a novel
scheme for decorating the club hall,
which will go far to make the dance
a success.
This evening will be the first time in
a number of years that the Palace
Orchostra has been Heard on the cam
pus. The Rose Room musicians only
infrequently play outside San Fran
cisco, their engagement tonight for
the Encina Dance being one of the
few occasions they have played this
year in any place other than the Bay
Cities. The Cardinal one-stop, a new
jazz number, played in the Palace
for the first time last month, will be
included on the reportlre this even
ing. â€”
Among the players who will be
heard tonight are Gene Rose, the
pianist; Beban, the saxaphone play
er; Sauseda, Muggy. Clrcellia, and
Stafford.
