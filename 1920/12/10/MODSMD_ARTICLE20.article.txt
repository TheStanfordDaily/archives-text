# RETARDED SPARKS

### 
Heeza Stude wandered across the
Quad to his classroom and on his way
accosted by a genial bum who bor
rowed his pencil. Stude's arrival at
the classroom was closely followed by
a stiff, stringent ex. His biography
follows:
For the want o'i' a pencil the ex was
lost;
For the want of the ex. the course was
lost;
For the want of a course his tuition
was lost;
When he lost his tuition his fortune
was lost;
And so we deduct that alius was lost.
—Limberlost.
