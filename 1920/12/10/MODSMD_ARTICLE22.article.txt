### United Press 
CHICAGO, Dec. 10. —William Hale
Thompson, mayor of Chicago, called
Charles Fitzmorris, former newspaper
reporter, in his office and gave him
the job of chief of police and this as
signment:
"Clean Chicago up. Put every gun
man, criminal and bootlegger in jail."
This happened only recently, but 'to
day Chicago is cleaner than any time
In years.
Fitzmorris, only 35, is the youngest
metropolitan police chief in the coun
try and it is generally admitted he is
putting his new job over with a bang.
First of all he called his police force
in and said: "You are now starting on
a clean slate. Charges of ineffciency
have been made against many of you.
I'll forget all that now. Every man
must make good or get out of the de
partment. Chicago must be clean."
Next, Fitzmorris served notice on
gamblers, bootleggers and criminals
that Chicago no longer was their
stamping ground. The demimonde did
not heed him. So Fitzmorris started
raids of gambling dives and vice d'ens.
All those found in the places were
taken to police headquarters.
the whole city was invited to come
to jail the next day to look over the
crowd to see if any could be identified
with any recent crimes. Bertillion
records were made of every man ar
rested.
Since then, raids have netted hun
dreds and the criminal class is about
to "play quits," realizing the new
chief means business.
On Fitzmorris' first day as police
chief he "scooped" the whole police
department by going out and arrest
ing a bandit who had robbed a bank.
The bandit had been sought by police
for several weeks.
No amount of influence will get any
Chicagoan out of a "jam" now, the
new chief claims.
