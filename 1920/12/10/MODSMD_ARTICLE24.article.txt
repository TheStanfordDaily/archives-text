# FOOTBALL BY ELECTRIC LIGHT DRAWS GREAT PHILADELPHIA CROWDS

### United Press 
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 10. â€”'The
football season may be officially
closed, but Philadelphians are not
through with the game. While the
big college and amateur followers of
the pigskin have soaked their toga in
moth balls, for score or more of the
Quaker boys have just opened a sea
son of "indoor football."
Ten thousand enthusiastic support
ers of the gridiron are witnessing the
sport weekly. The games are being
played in the evening instead of the
afternoon.
The Second City Trooop, Pennsyl
vania State Police, who for years have
taken a large part in independent state
athletics, were the originators of the
new indoor sport. Manager Joseph P.
Maguire, formerly end of the Villa
nova eleven, has arranged a schedule
that may extend throughout the
winter. Lew Little, former Penn star,
is the coach.
The big new drill hall of the caval
ry armory here, at one time planned
to hold the biggest horse shows in
these parts ,is being used by the troop
ers for daily workouts and weekly
contests with rival troop elevens in
the state.
The huge vaulted roof of the hall
is far higher than the loftiest punts
ever travel. The playing surface is
tan bark. Regulation uniforms, in
cluding cleated shoes, are being used.
The playing field has been shortened
five yards to permit sufficient space
to catch forward passes back of the
goal line. The kick-off, however, takes
place on the 40-yard line. The field
is of regulation width. Lighting ef
fects are perfect. Powerful arclights
with top reflectors make the entire
hall as brilliant as a cloudless mid
day.
The "ghost ball," instead of the or
dinary colored oval, is being used
because it can be seen better In the
artificial light.
