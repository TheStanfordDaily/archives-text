# Jupiter Pluvius "Reigns" Joy on Parched Lagunita
## 
### 
Lake Laguanita's Sahara-like ex
panses of dry lake bottom is rapidly fill
ing up as a result of the recent heavy
rains, and if the present rate of progress
keeps up devotees of the canoe should
have a chance to risk their lives on the
waters by the opening of the winter
quarter, or soon thereafter. The day
before yesterday water started coming in
from the creek at a rapid rate, and is
now taxing the flume to its full ca
pacity.
The flume was recently repaired and
braced up to prepare it for the greate.it
possible amount of water that it could
carry, and today the flume is not only
carrying its full capacity, but water is
running over at the dam. The dam
itself has been strengthened by con
crete slabs four inches thick, and in
stallation of flash boxes 011 the filmic
has helped to take care of the flow.
Already the water is up to the outlet
of the lake and has surrounded the foun
tain in the middle of the bed. This time
last year the lake was a dry as the
proverbial bone, and did not fill up until
late in March of this year. With the
rains working overtime, and the diver
sion dam at the rock-crusher, along with
the flume, doing their share to take carc
of the water, prospects for a good boat
ing season look bright.
Keep the 'Daily' Intact
