# PASQUALE AMATO CONCERT PLEASING
## Operatic Star Possessed of Voice of Singular Quality; Kitty Beale Scores Success 
### (By Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Possessing a voice rich and firm in-i
quality, and a personality at once win-j
ning enthusiastic appreciation, Pasqualel
Amato made the second Peninsula con
cert last evening a most enjoyable event
in Stanford's musical season.
Amato's singing is that of the true
operatic artist—a blending of dramatic
interest with beauty of tone and com
plete technical power. His voice is firm
and excellent in timbre, and is con
trolled with seemingly unconscious ease.
Even the most intricate trills he executes
with perfect control and even with per
sonal enjoyment. His transition from
the most delicate tones to heavy emo
tional passages is accomplished, with
admirable technical ability. He has the
gift of including his audience in every
song.
Kitty Beale, who assisted Amato, pos
sesses a voice definitely lyric, clear and
controlled with exquisite finish. The
nature of her selections were remark
ably well suited to her youth and charm
of manner.
Both artists presented a variety
of numbers and responded gener
ously with many encores. Perhaps the
song most enthusiastically received was
Amato's interpretation of Figaro's song
from the "Barber of Seville," which he
sang as an encore. The quality of his
voice was particularly capable of the va
riety of shading required in this selec
tion. which he sang with intense anima
tion and imagery.
Amato's singing of the well-known
"Prologue" from "Pagliaci" won in
stant response through its beauty and
brilliancy of composition. This number
was sung with exquisite finish and was
most satisfying in imaginative coloring.
Durante's "Danza Fanicula," a short in
genious number, was a test of the artist's
technical control, and two old French
songs in the same group were delight
ful in their whimsical appeal. They
were sung in a manner truly in sym
pathy with the French genius.
Two compositions by Hahn also af
forded ample opportunity for a variety
of shading as well as a broad range in
intensity of tone. The "Drinking Song''
from Thomas' "Hamlet" was dramatic
and spirited, and in it Amato displayed
a carefully controlled breadth of tone
characterized by remarkably rapid
changes in the singer's voice. As an
encore to this number Amato sang the
"Toreador Song'' from "Carmen,''
which was enthusiastically applauded as
soon as the opening notes were heard
and which proved to be one of the most
enjoyable of Atnato's selections.
Miss Beale's "Caro Nome" was most
pleasing. Her voice is of captivating
quality and was at its best in this song.
Her singing of Arditi's "Parla Waltz"
was also an interesting number, and
Rimsky-Korsakow's "The Rose Enslaves
the Nightingale" had a peculiarly
melodic and fascinating effect. The
"Shadow Song" from "Dinorah" empha
sized the technical capabilities .of the
young artist's voice, as well as iis
warmth and purity of style.
The closing number, the only song
sung by Mr. Amato and Miss Beale to
gether, was Henschel's duet, "La Condc
liera," which conformed to the general
nature of the other selections, empha
sizing what was best in the art of each
singer, and was a satisfying close to the
program.

intensity of tone. The "Drinking Song''
from Thomas' "Hamlet" was dramatic
and spirited, and in it Amato displayed
a carefully controlled breadth of tone
characterized by remarkably rapid
changes in the singer's voice. As an
encore to this number Amato sang the
"Toreador Song'' from "Carmen,''
which was enthusiastically applauded as
soon as the opening notes were heard
and which proved to be one of the most
enjoyable of Atnato's selections.
Miss Beale's "Caro Nome" was most
pleasing. Her voice is of captivating
quality and was at its best in this song.
Her singing of Arditi's "Parla Waltz"
was also an interesting number, and
Rimsky-Korsakow's "The Rose Enslaves
the Nightingale" had a peculiarly
melodic and fascinating effect. The
"Shadow Song" from "Dinorah" empha
sized the technical capabilities .of the
young artist's voice, as well as iis
warmth and purity of style.
The closing number, the only song
sung by Mr. Amato and Miss Beale to
gether, was Henschel's duet, "La Condc
liera," which conformed to the general
nature of the other selections, empha
sizing what was best in the art of each
singer, and was a satisfying close to the
program.

Possessing a voice rich and firm in-i
quality, and a personality at once win-j
ning enthusiastic appreciation, Pasqualel
Amato made the second Peninsula con
cert last evening a most enjoyable event
in Stanford's musical season.
Amato's singing is that of the true
operatic artist—a blending of dramatic
interest with beauty of tone and com
plete technical power. His voice is firm
and excellent in timbre, and is con
trolled with seemingly unconscious ease.
Even the most intricate trills he executes
with perfect control and even with per
sonal enjoyment. His transition from
the most delicate tones to heavy emo
tional passages is accomplished, with
admirable technical ability. He has the
gift of including his audience in every
song.
Kitty Beale, who assisted Amato, pos
sesses a voice definitely lyric, clear and
controlled with exquisite finish. The
nature of her selections were remark
ably well suited to her youth and charm
of manner.
Both artists presented a variety
of numbers and responded gener
ously with many encores. Perhaps the
song most enthusiastically received was
Amato's interpretation of Figaro's song
from the "Barber of Seville," which he
sang as an encore. The quality of his
voice was particularly capable of the va
riety of shading required in this selec
tion. which he sang with intense anima
tion and imagery.
Amato's singing of the well-known
"Prologue" from "Pagliaci" won in
stant response through its beauty and
brilliancy of composition. This number
was sung with exquisite finish and was
most satisfying in imaginative coloring.
Durante's "Danza Fanicula," a short in
genious number, was a test of the artist's
technical control, and two old French
songs in the same group were delight
ful in their whimsical appeal. They
were sung in a manner truly in sym
pathy with the French genius.
Two compositions by Hahn also af
forded ample opportunity for a variety
of shading as well as a broad range in
intensity of tone. The "Drinking Song''
