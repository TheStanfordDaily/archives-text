# PASQUALE AMATO CONCERT PLEASING
## Operatic Star Possessed of Voice of Singular Quality; Kitty Beale Scores Success 
### (By Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Possessing a voice rich and firm in-i
quality, and a personality at once win-j
ning enthusiastic appreciation, Pasqualel
Amato made the second Peninsula con
cert last evening a most enjoyable event
in Stanford's musical season.
Amato's singing is that of the true
operatic artistâ€”a blending of dramatic
interest with beauty of tone and com
plete technical power. His voice is firm
and excellent in timbre, and is con
trolled with seemingly unconscious ease.
Even the most intricate trills he executes
with perfect control and even with per
sonal enjoyment. His transition from
the most delicate tones to heavy emo
tional passages is accomplished, with
admirable technical ability. He has the
gift of including his audience in every
song.
Kitty Beale, who assisted Amato, pos
sesses a voice definitely lyric, clear and
controlled with exquisite finish. The
nature of her selections were remark
ably well suited to her youth and charm
of manner.
Both artists presented a variety
of numbers and responded gener
ously with many encores. Perhaps the
song most enthusiastically received was
Amato's interpretation of Figaro's song
from the "Barber of Seville," which he
sang as an encore. The quality of his
voice was particularly capable of the va
riety of shading required in this selec
tion. which he sang with intense anima
tion and imagery.
Amato's singing of the well-known
"Prologue" from "Pagliaci" won in
stant response through its beauty and
brilliancy of composition. This number
was sung with exquisite finish and was
most satisfying in imaginative coloring.
Durante's "Danza Fanicula," a short in
genious number, was a test of the artist's
technical control, and two old French
songs in the same group were delight
ful in their whimsical appeal. They
were sung in a manner truly in sym
pathy with the French genius.
