### United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10—A belief
that San Franciscans had a hand in
the lynching last night at Santa Rosa
of Terry Fitts, Charles Valento, and
George Boyd, Howard street gangsters,
who murdered three officers Sunday,
was expressed this morning by the
police.
It was reported that twenty auto
mobiles with their license numbers
obscured crossed during the evening
from San Francisco to Sausalito on a
ferry boat and drove off on the road
which leads to Santa Rosa. Rumors
are prevalent that San Francisco po
lice were In the party.

emn obligation to deal adequately with

noma County," Governor Stephens de
clared in a statement issued today in

Santa Rosa last night.
Gangster Trial Postponed
In San Francisco
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10—Shack
led together with clanking chains, Ed
mund (Spud)) Murphy, Edward (K.0.)
Kruvosky, Allen McDonald, Thomas
Brady and James Carey, Howard
Street gangsters, were led into court
this morning by a heavy police guard
to hear the indictments against them
selves.
The clerk of the court called off
their names and then called off the
names of Terry Fitts,' Charles Valente
and George Boyd.
"They are dead, hanged by a mob
at Santa Rosa at midnight last night,"
the District Attorney announced.
All five prisoners raised their eyes
and looking around the room saw a
small crowd which did not show any
emotion.
"Have you any official communica
tion that these men are dead?" asked
the court. "None," was the answer.
The court then ordered the trial to
be put over until tomorrow.
One Hundred Men
Compose Mob '
SANTA ROSA, Dec. I.—About one
hundred armed and masked bandits
composed the mob which raided the
Sonoma County Jail at midnight last
night, disarmed Sheriff Boyes and his
deputies and lynched Terry Fitts,
George Boyd, and Charles Valente,
under indictment for the murder of
three peace officers last Sunday.
Masked guards with rifles in their
hands and revolvers strapped outside
their overcoats were stationed by the
lynchers at the four street corners
leading to the county jail. Pedestrians
and autoists approaching the jail were
stopped and turned in another direc
tion.
The band heavily armed rushed into
the jail where they were met by
Sheriff John M. Boyes and several
deputies. Guns were thrust against
the bodies of the officers, and Jewett,
the jailer, was made to hand over
the keys.
The three prisoners were dragged
from their cells and hung on the limb
of an oak tree in the Odd Fellows'
Cemetery.
Governor Stevens said: —
"No matter what the provocation,
no matter how little sympathy with
the men, the lynching at Santta Rosa
is unjustified. No matter how good
the standing of the citizens who par
ticipated theirs was mob rule and even
if convinced that the act was one of
substantial justice, the example they
have set, undermines respect for the
law and weakens the administration
of justice.
"If the police are remiss in per
mitting lawless gangs to exist in our
cities, if the courts failed in their
duty, if the administration of criminal
statues is uneffective, then let us re
medy conditions."
