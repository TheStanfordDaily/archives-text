# CAMPUS OPINION FOR "DAILY" FUND CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
An increase in the financial allotment
allowed The Daily Palo Alto is advo
cated by the majority of students who
are taking an active part in campus
affairs. The general trend of campus
opinion seems to point toward the un
divided support, on the part of the
Student Body, of a financial campaign
that will permit the Daily to keep up
its present standard without incurring
further debts.
The opinion of the Student Body is
reflected in the statemetns of Stanford
men following:
E. R. Martin, '18, graduate manager:
"I believe that the proposed move is a
good, expedient way of meeting this
financial problem. The Daily Palo Aito
is undoubtedly in need of support from
the Student Body."
"After a thorough examination of th".
conditions of The Daily Palo Alto, I
am convinced that the paper must have
financial assistance from the Student
Body, and that the present management
is in no way responsible for those con
ditions," says R. L. Tcmplcton, '18,
Student Body Manager.
W. I. Ames, '17: "I want to see The
Daily Palo Alto the best college paper
an the Pacific Coast. The students

should supply any additional funds
necessary to meet the present emer
gency."
C. H. Long, '19, president of Phi
Delta Phi: "I am strongly in favor of a
financial campaign to keep the Daily up
to its present standards, it is worthy
at all times of student support."
"The Daily Palo Alto should cer r
tainly be supported by the Studeut
Body," declares C. J. Tauzcr, '20. "The
management should be allowed enough
money to keep the paper on a par with
other college dailies. I will support a
move that will afford them that amount
of money."
Morris Kirksey, '17, captain of the
1921 track team: "Every student ougi.i
to be behind the Daily. If the manage
ment hasn't enough money to continue
publication and maintain the present
standards, the Student Body should be
willing to contribute the required amount
toward the paper's upkeep."
J. T. Murphy, '20, manager of the
Men's Union, declares in favor of stu
dent support of the move. "We ought to
have a college daily, of course It's up
to the Student Body to see that we keep
ours up to the college standard."
