"How Not to Play Football" os the
title of an amusing group of feature
pictures collected by the "Pictorial"
staff photographer which will appear
in the next issue of that magazine
which will be 011 sale next Wednes
day. The subjects of this unusual
page of pictures are the freak photo
graphs caught by the rapid action
camera during the past season. It
shows many queer plays and poses
that might have been able to deceive
the eye but not a rapid action camera.
Marion Kyle, '18, has contributed an
article that comes far out of the ordi
nary run of local contributions. Its
title is a "Highbrow among the Low
brows," is it portrays the exepriences
of the unfortunate highbrow who
finds himself located in a college com
munity. Kyle's article forms an in
teresting commentary on the conven
tional type fo wisdom and made-to
order morals.
An editorial entitled "Chemically
Pure" contains a violent protest
against the practice of the University
Administration which censors the pro
duction of local plays. The tone of
the editorial deplores the existence
of faculty blue perciling parties and
the Anthony Comstock tradition which
makes this possible.
