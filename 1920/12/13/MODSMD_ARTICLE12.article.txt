# YOUR VOTE WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF 'THE DAILY
## EX-COMMITTEE EFFECTS A CHANGE IN ITS PLANS THAT GUARANTEE AGAINST ANY MIS-USE OF FUNDS Many Student Body Leaders Endorse Proposed Amendment 
### (By W. F. Leiser, '21 
To provide the Student Body against possible mi6iise of any funds which
might be voted the Daily Palo Alto, and to guarantee against the accumulation
of any surplus which might be used unwisely in administration of the Daily,
the Eexecutive Committee in special session Friday voted to change the form
of the amendment to be presented for balloting Wednesday, to read:
"That an additional fifty cents per quarter shall be added to the
registration fee to be held in trust by the Student Executive Com
mittee and to be dispersed to meet the needs of the Daily Palo Alto,
at the end of each quarter all surplus shall revert to the Executive
Committee.
"That the edtior and manager of the Daily Palo Alto shall be
paid a flat salary to be determined by the Executive Committee, and
they shall receive no bonus of any nature."

The first part of the measure is a
recommendation to the Board of Trus
tees, the second an amendment to the
constitution of the Student Body.
All Surplus Goes
To Student Body
The amendment provides first that
all money shall go through the Exe
cutive Committee, that all funds shall
be held by the committee in "trust"
for the Daily to be given to the paper
as its needs are demonstrated. The
Executive Committee will allot to the
paper each quarter only an amount
necessary to make it financially sound.
All that remains will revert to the
Student Body for use as it sees fit.
This provision guarantees that the
Daily will not accumulate money not
immediately needed in the production
of the paper, and that all funds not
so used will not accrue to the credit
of the Daily Palo Alto, but will be
used to meet the regular needs of
the Associated Students. In event
then that production costs are reduced
sometime in the future, the Student
Body will reap the benefit.
Board of Trustees to revoke any as-
It is always within the power of the
sessment if at any time in investiga
tion by the Comptroller, university
auditor, of the President of the Uni
versity it should be found that more
money than necessary is being voted
for student enterprises.
A Guarantee Against
Unreasonable Profits
The amendment providing against
a bonus for either editor or manager
guarantees that neither official will
strive to use a greater amount of the
"trust" funds than needed in order to
create a large surplus or profit at the
end of each year, of which he would
get a large percentage under the pres
ent plan.

To provide the Student Body against possible mi6iise of any funds which
might be voted the Daily Palo Alto, and to guarantee against the accumulation
of any surplus which might be used unwisely in administration of the Daily,
the Eexecutive Committee in special session Friday voted to change the form
of the amendment to be presented for balloting Wednesday, to read:
"That an additional fifty cents per quarter shall be added to the
registration fee to be held in trust by the Student Executive Com
mittee and to be dispersed to meet the needs of the Daily Palo Alto,
at the end of each quarter all surplus shall revert to the Executive
Committee.
"That the edtior and manager of the Daily Palo Alto shall be
paid a flat salary to be determined by the Executive Committee, and
they shall receive no bonus of any nature."

The first part of the measure is a
recommendation to the Board of Trus
tees, the second an amendment to the
constitution of the Student Body.
All Surplus Goes
To Student Body
The amendment provides first that
all money shall go through the Exe
cutive Committee, that all funds shall
be held by the committee in "trust"
for the Daily to be given to the paper
as its needs are demonstrated. The
Executive Committee will allot to the
paper each quarter only an amount
necessary to make it financially sound.
All that remains will revert to the
Student Body for use as it sees fit.
This provision guarantees that the
Daily will not accumulate money not
immediately needed in the production
of the paper, and that all funds not
so used will not accrue to the credit
of the Daily Palo Alto, but will be
used to meet the regular needs of
the Associated Students. In event
then that production costs are reduced
sometime in the future, the Student
Body will reap the benefit.
Board of Trustees to revoke any as-
It is always within the power of the
sessment if at any time in investiga
tion by the Comptroller, university
auditor, of the President of the Uni
versity it should be found that more
money than necessary is being voted
for student enterprises.
A Guarantee Against
Unreasonable Profits
The amendment providing against
a bonus for either editor or manager
guarantees that neither official will
strive to use a greater amount of the
"trust" funds than needed in order to
create a large surplus or profit at the
end of each year, of which he would
get a large percentage under the pres
ent plan.
