### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â€”An agree
ment between Japan and the United
States to limit naval armament does not
meet the favor of Secretary Daniels, he
told newspaper men today. Daniels said
he would endorse an understanding to
reduce sea power only in event that it
was world-wide in character.
An agreement among any such powers
would appear too much like an alliance
and would arouse the suspicions of other
nations, he said.
The secretary indicated that when he
goes before the House naval affairs
committee to report the naval construc
tion program that he will urge that a
naval increase is imperative until the
United States enters a world-wide
agreement.
