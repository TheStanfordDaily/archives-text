# BEAUTIFYING THE CAMPUS
## 
### 
Following out Senator Stanford's plan to make the Stanford cam
pus famed for its beauty, noted landscape gardeners have for the past
several years been making improvements on the campus in the way of
planting new trees and shrubs, and removing specimens that blocked
the view of the campus and of the hills.
This work has been going on lately under the direction of Comp
troller Roth, who is being assisted by John McLaren, the landscape
gardener who was in charge of the gardening at the San b rancisco
Exposition, and Professor Leroy Abrams of the Botany department.
These men, with the aid of I. E. Nyquist, university gardener, have made
many recent changes that help to improve the beauty of the campus.
About 100 new specimens of trees and shrubs have been planted in the
Arboretum, and several trees that were acting as obstructions
been taken out. The eucalyptus trees near Palm Drive that have just
been cut down were removed to allow a clear view of the foothills.
Rare specimens in the Arboretum that have been obscured by other
trees and shrubs are now open to view because of recent removals of
obstructions.
Comptroller ißotli has also been active in tearing down wooden
buildings on the campus. Several of the old barns that prevented a
clear view of Roble Hall from Palm Drive have been removed, and
small trees and shrubs have been planted in the cleared space.
The work of beautifying the campus is going on yearly and in
time the fame of the Stanford campus will rival that of the older East
ern universities.
