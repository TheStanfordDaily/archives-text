Funny-face was howling the other

The Hickville Herald comes to the
front with the remark in its society
column that Miss Dora Sparks and
Mr. James Flint of Oskaloosa, Okla

The hard-losing pitcher waxed right
wroth at the close of a baseball game

the Gym cheaper 'n that.
"This is what I call a case of short
weight," said the fifteen-ounce dog as
he was put in the pound.
