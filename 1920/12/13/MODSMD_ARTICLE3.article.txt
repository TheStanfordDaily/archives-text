# TREES BEING COT IN ARBORETUM TO BEAUTIFY CAMPUS
## Many Specimens Planted in Early Days Removed to Make Room for Better Ones

With the advice and cooperation 01
John J. McLaren, creator of Golden
Gate Park and the planting scheme at
the Panama-Pacific Exposition; Pro
fessor Leroy Abrams, of the Botany
Department of the University; and I. A
Nyquist, University gardener, Comp
troller A. E. Roth is carrying througl
a comprehensive plan of development in
the* University Arboretum which will
make it not only one of the finest collec
tions of trees in the country for scien
tific purposes, but also a place of ever
greater beauty than it is now.
This 200-acre polt of ground, extend
ing from the entrance of the University
grounds for nearly a mile on both side
of the main approach to the buildings
was set out to trees even before the
Univeristy was founded. In order tc
obtain a quick showing of trees and tc
afford cover for valuable young trees
species were planted which in time
threatened to crowd out more valuable
speciments. From time to time thes.
less valuable trees have been cut out, and
as opportunity arose other valuable trees
have been planted, so that the Arboretum
has already a notable collection. A few
years ago the University established an
annual appropriation of $500 to assist in
this work of obtaining desirable trees
and of labeling the species.
Now, however, a definite scheme of
planting extending over a number of
years has been undertaken. Chauncey
T. Keefer, University engineer, has pie
pared a map of the plot. A trained land
scape draftsman will go through tin
Arboretum and on this map mark the
location of trees as they exist now;
then Mr. McLaren and Professor
Abrams will develop the future plan for
planting with a view to both scientific
and scenic value.
The work of eliminating diseased and
otherwise undesirable trees has already
begun. Specimens which are crowding
out more valuable trees, and which hide
the more beautiful speciments from
view or cut off views of the University
buildings and of the hills, are being
taken out.
Particular attention is being paid to
preserve groups of trees, especially the
native trees, and to the location of lovv
growing shrubbery as ground cover in
open spaces. Groups of eucalyptus wili
be formed by this plan in favorable
locations.
Professor Rennie Doan, of the Ento
mology Department, is advising which
trees ought to be cut down on account
of insect depredations, and which can
be saved. For many years his class in
forest insects protected the Monteiej
pines, but during the war the cessation
