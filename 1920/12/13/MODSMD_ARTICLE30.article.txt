## Salesman Says He Can Forecast the Life of Engaged While Buying the Ring

NEW YORK, Dec. 13.—There is no
business that furnishes a better oppor
tunity to study human psychology than
that _of selling jewelry, according to
William Barthman, who for more than a
quarter of a century has had a shop in
Maiden Lane, the diamond center of
America.
"One can invariably forecast the mar
ried life of a couple by their attitude
when they come in to buy the engage
ment ring," he said today.
"ft is easy to tell which will dominate
after the wedding ceremony from their
actions during the purchase. If she
makes the selection and fixes the price,
you may depend upon it that she will
make most of the decisions after they
are married, and vice versa. It is also
possible to tell whether she will be
thrifty or a spendthrift."
Barthman cited an instance -*
young couple who came in to buy ;
mond solitaire. The youth very
cately let his sweetheart understand
he did not feel able to pay more
$400 or $500. But every ring sh»
cided upon was valued at $1,2C
$1,500. They finally compromised oi
costing about $900. about twice wh;
had intended to pay.
"And if I had been that young
1 would have been tempted to ci
off right there," the gray-haired jev
declared.
Barthman was asked how the ave
young man determines the size of
engagement ring.
"Well, a few of them bring t
fiances right in to try it on," he repl
"Some obtain from us a cardboard
rangement to fix the size. Others k
a string about her finger, or try one
the rings she already has on one
their fingers. But the great majority
just guess at it —and usually guess
wrong. Most of those who guess select
a ring too large, probably assuming they
will be on the safe side when it conies
to readjusting it. But it is just as easy to
make a ring larger as it is to make it
smaller."
What does the average young man
buy his sweetheart, in the way of jew
elry, and what does the average married
man buy his wife?
Barthma nsaid that gold or silvci
meshbags are the most ppoular gift dur
ing the courtship period, with gold brace
lets and pearl opera glasses running a
close second. After marriage, the woman
usually demands a pearl necklace or a
diamond or platinum bracelet, and
gets it.
Gifts for children are generally in the
form of a ring, bracelet or pin.
When women make gifts to men they
generally select a scarfpiti or a gold
fountain pen.
"It's interesting to watch the develop
ment of a young couple's courtship and
marriage," Barthman said. "A young
man will come in and buy some small
present, such as a brooch, costing $15
or $20. A few months later he will make
a little more expensive gift. Then, as
birthdays and Christmases arrive, he in
creases the value of his gifts until finally
the engagement ring is bought. Next is
the wedding ring. After this there is a
cessation of three or four years. They
are spending all their money furnishing
a home and making a start. If he is
successful in business, this period will
be followed by one of far more ex
pensive presents."
Barthman said the expected slump in
jewelry sales, looked for long ago, had
not yet become apparent.
