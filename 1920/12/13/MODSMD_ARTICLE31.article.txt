## 
### WEBB MILLER (United Press Staff Correspondent 
LONDON, Dec. 1 (By Mail).—A
gigantic labor union is being organized
in Indian by leaders who frankly state
that they will attempt to use the strike
weapon to obtain political independence
for India. Ben Spoor, British labor
Member of Parliament, who is going to
India in the dual role of emissary of the
English Labor party and as a delegate
to the India Nationlal Congress, which
meets at Nagpor, December 15, is very
optimistic about the spread of unionism
in the land of the Rajah.
"The Labor Federation of India is a
two-bladed sword with which the Indian
workers can sever the ties of British
rule and economic slavery at the same
stroke," declared Spoor to the United
Press. "The Federation will speedily
enroll millions of workers, as all thai
is necessary is to organize the different
castes, which arc themselves really iron
bound unions, simply awaiting leader
ship. . • r j
"The strike is a new weapon in Indian
hands, but the yare beginning to feci its
power, which accounts for the epidemic
of strikes now breaking over India. I
have no doubt but that India will see the
growth of the biggest centralized union
in the world within the next year or two,
and it is natural that direct action should
follow aolng the lines of a struggle for
political freedom. The British Labor
party is in closest accord with the aims
of the Indian labor movement and I am
empowered to extend them our fraternal
greetings and promise of assistance."
The National Indian Congress, one of
the biggest political organizations in the
world, with a membership of over seven
millions pledged to work for India s
freedom, lias pledged its resources to aid
the laborites, according to Secretary
Blizard of the British Committee of
the Congress.
"The fact that some of our members
arc in the capitalist class will not pre
vent us extending cooperation to the In
dian labor movement," he said. "We ex
pect (lie Labor Federation of India to
become our most effective ally. We hav:
backed Gandhi and mis non-violent no
cooperation, but naturally this is a slow
way of arousing the national conscious
ness. India is unquestionably in the
mood for a radical organization to as
sume leadership."
