# LADY ASTOR SPEAKS BEFORE BIG MEETING OF ENGLISHMEN
## 
### 
LONDON, Dec. 1 (By Mail to United
Press.) —Lady Astor is disappointed in
women.
And she told them so in a speech
which she made to masses of them at
the opening of the Englishwoman's Ex
hibition.
"I am glad that the days of the cling
ing, dependent woman are over," she
said. "When I was a child I used to
read about heroines who fainted at the
sight of a rat and wondered if I would
grow up like that."
However, while admitting that women
have outgrown these puerilities, she de
plored their lack of logic iii the matter
of dress.
"This is a testing time fur Women,''
she continued, "but when 1 walk down
Bond Street and see the way they dress,
I think they have bee ntested, and have
failed. What should we think if men
change dtlie length of their trousers
every year?" she asked.
Lady Astor appealed to the women to
dress moresensibly, as men do. Her idea
seemed to be that if their skirts reached
a logical conclusion, their brains might
get theresome day, too.
Another grudge which Lady Astor has
against women is their absolute lack of
loyalty. She declared that women would
not vote for women, just because they
were women—whereas men never re
frained from voting for a member of
their own sex merely because he was of
that sex.
Judging from opinions expressed by
members of the audience, most of the
women there were entirely in accord
with Lady Astor. They agreed that in
the main women were foolish creatures.
That is why they vote for men.
