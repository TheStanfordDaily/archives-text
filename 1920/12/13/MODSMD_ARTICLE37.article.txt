# SOCCER TEAMS WILL REST OVER HOLIDAYS
## 
### 
Saturday's soccer game with the
Olympic Club was called off when it
became apparent that the tennis could
not play in the rainstorm which turned
the field into a muddy battleground. The
game will therefore probably not be
played utnil January 15, the date orig
inally set. In the meantime the team
will take a rest over'the holidays and
should be in good shape to meet the
Olympics when the game finally comes
Offjfl
, 'fljr freshman soccer team also had a
game scheduled for Saturday with the
Palo Alto Higli School team, but it
was postponed on account of the
weather, also. This leaves the fresh
men with no games to play until after
the holidays, so both soccer teams wiil
not be busy again for a few weeks.
