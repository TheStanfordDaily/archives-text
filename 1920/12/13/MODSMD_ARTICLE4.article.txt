# "Chappie" Sounds the S. O. S. Call for K. O. Number
## 
### 
The January "Chappie" will be an
issue of grievous complaint. Chappie
himself has no complaint to make
because the world was kind in the
last issue and many were the ludic
rous and funny perpetrations therein
In the January number, however,
Chappie and his crew will try to emu
late a double quartet of steam rivet
ters and put over a barrage of knocks
that will give the readers the true
'inside dope' on each and every out
of the, bright and otherwise, lights of
the University and its environs.
All the members of the student and
faculty are invited to lodge their bit
of complaint at the world, at the other
side, or at any one person or group
of persons. Chappie's only desire is
that the grouches and complaints be
made in a humorous or (seemingly
humorous) manner. He is out to treat
the public to the most foolish number
yet published and beseaches the help
of ever vlayman, laymbrain, wit and
half-wit.
