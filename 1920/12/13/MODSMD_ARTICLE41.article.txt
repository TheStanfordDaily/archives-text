# JUNIOR AND SENIOR HOCKEY TEAMS PLAY FINAL GAME TOMORROW
## 
### 
The final game in the women's
hockey series which was postponed
because of the rain last Thursday will
be held tomorrow afternoon on the
Roble Field, at 4:30. The junior team
is scheduled to meet the senior eleven,
in what will probably be the fastest
gpe this season.
So far the juniors and seniors have
not lost a single game in the final
series. Even though the juniors de
feated the senior team in the prelimi
nary games at the first of the year,
the senior team has picked up dur
ing the last few weeks and each team
feels confident of filling the coveted
first place.
A special request has been sent out
to the members of the two classes in
particular and to the campus women
in general to make the attendance
at this gabe a large one. There will
be a great amount of action in the
game due to the fact that the two
best teams are pitted against each
other.
