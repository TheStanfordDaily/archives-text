# Boxing Tournament Uncovers New Material
## 
### 
The preliminaries in the novices' box
ing tournament were run off Thursday
in the bantam, feather, and lightweight
classes. The bouts were of two two
minute rounds each with two minuter
of rest intervening. Fifty per cent of
the score was dependent on aggressive
ness and the rest on actual points, owing
to the relatively small amount of science
that the beginners have been able to
absorb during one quarter.
The preliminaries in the remaining
classes will be run off today, and In
structor T. J. Murphy expects to see as
many "comers" as he did last week. At
the beginning of next quarter trie intra
mural tournament will be held.
