# ATHLETICS HINGE ON MAINTAINING PRESENT "DAILY"
## Skull and Snakes, Powell, and Faculty Athletic Board are For the Increase in Rates 
### 
Maintenance of The Daily Palo Alto
at its present size and standards is essen
tial to Stanford athletics, in the opinion
of Skull and Snakes and the leading
athletes of the campus. Not only by pro
viding proper publicity for games, but
because the Daily is the agency by which
the University can get 111 touch with
promising athletes in high schools, the
athletic leaders of the campus are as a
unit in support of the increased rate.
Skull and Snakes Favors Increase
Fred L. Adams, president of Skull
and Snakes, this morning issued a state
ment expressing the action of the so 1
cicty on the proposal, which declares:
"Skull and Snakes, believing that the
present high standards of The Daily
Palo Alto should be maintained, and
realizing that this is impossible under
present conditions, went on record at a
special meeting, held December 9, as
being J/i full sympathy with tin* needs
of the Daily and favoring a plan of put
ting an extra 50 cents 011 the registra
tion fee of the student body, to be used
by the A. S. S. U. in maintaining the
standards of our daily, newspaper."
"Vote Yes," Says Powell
No one has taken greater interest in
the propc seel increase than Coach Walter
Powell, who has urged all friends of
Stanford athletics to vote for the in
crease. "1 want to see The Daily Paio
Alto kept up to its present standards and
made the greatest university newspaper
in the West," declared Powell this
morning. "While 1 am not familiar witil
the history of the Daily, I have watched
it since coming to Stanford, and strongly
believe that it justifies the encourage
ment of both students and faculty. It
has done a great work in the past 111
assisting athletics and it will be of great
assistance to the coaching staff in the
future if it is properly maintained."
"Dad" Moulton Backs Measure
For twenty years "Dad" Moulton has
been in touch with Stanford athlctics
and knows as no one else the value of a
campus paper in making successful
teams. The veteran trainer last night
said: "I do not see how anyone ac
quainted with the Daily and with Stan
ford can object to the proposal. My
years of connection with athletics at
Stanford have convinced me of the
value of a campus newspaper to athletic
coaches and teams. Why impair that
value when we can maintain the present
Daily by a slight increase in rates?"
Increase Necessary Declares Angell
Dr. Frank Angell, chairman of the
Faculty Athletic Committee for many
years, urges that the student body volt
affirmatively on the proposal. "The pro
posed increase in rates," asserts Dr.
Angell, "is clearly necessary. It is evi
dent that the increased cost of publica
tion justifies the request for an increase
in rates. The Daily has expanded
greatly during the past year, and I
would regret to see the present stand
ards abandoned because of lack of
funds."
Varsity Captain Urges Support
The skipper of the 1921 football
eleven, Jack Patrick, is one of the var
sity captains who favors the increase in
rates. "I am heartily in favor of the
measure," asserted Patrick yesterday
evening. "If we are going to equal other
colleges in journalism, as we do in ath
letics, we must not sacrifice the presciu
high standards because the increased
cost of production has resulted m a
deficit under the present rates. The
Daily, if its present size is maintained,
will be a greater aid to Stanford ath
letics than if we go back to the old
style Daily."
