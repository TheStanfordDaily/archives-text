<$> <s>
<5> In my opinion the Daily Palo <$>
<§> Alto faces a situation, where, <$
<S> owing largely to increased print- <e>
<$> ing costs, it must either decrease <$>
<3> its size or obtain additional reve- <§>
<$>nue. That the need is immediate <§>
<$> is shown by following facts: On <$>
<3> November 1, the cost of print <§>
<3> paper used by the Daily increased <S>
<S> approximately 100%, and on Sep- <$>
<B>..tember 1, wages even increased <§>
<§> approximately 16%. <S>
