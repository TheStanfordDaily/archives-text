<«> In view of the fact that there <$>
<$> seems to be a certain laxity on <j>
<#> the part of some students with <j>
<s> regard to cheating in examina- <$>
<$>tions, the Men's Council hereby <$
<$> issues warning that ahy case of <s>
<t> cheating in examinations which <$
<§> are brought to its attention will <$>
<$> merit the severe punishment of <$
<t> suspension or expulsion from the
<8> University. Cheating in examina- <§
<j> tion is a breach of University <§>
<?> regulation, and a violation of the <$>
<$> Stanford standard of action and <S>
$ will not be tolerated. <S>
