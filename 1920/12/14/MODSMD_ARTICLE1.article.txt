### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.—For the
United States to agree with two or
three nations for a "holiday" in naval
construction would be a blacker act than
crime, Secretary of Navy Daniels toid
the House naval affairs committee to
day.
"The United States can agree to such
a suspension only when all the nations
of the world agree to do likewise,"
Daniels asserted. He strongly recom
mended the prompt completion of the
new three-year building program, and
asked for authorization for another pro
gram calling for building of eighty
eight vessels.
In support of the belief that the United
States could not agree with Great Brit
ain and Japan to stop building of arma
ments, the secretary allowed the chief
of naval operations to figures
showing the relation of the first lino
defenses of the three nations. If the
three nations could stop all constructior
now the United States would have a
first line defense of 648,000 tons, Great
Britain 854,000 tons, and Japan 326,000
tons, he said.
Daniels referred to the fact that an
alliance exists between Great Britain
and Japan. While Daniels was testify
ing Senator Borah introduced in the
Senate a resolution requesting the Presi
dent to enter into an agreement with
Great Britain and Japan to reduce arma
ments.
