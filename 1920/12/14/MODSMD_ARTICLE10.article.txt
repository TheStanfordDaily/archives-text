# "THE DAILY PALO ALTO" NEEDS YOUR VOTE TOMORROW
## CAMPAIGN FOR INCREASE TO AID "DAILY" ENDORSED WITHOUT QUALIFICATION Students and Faculty Men Who Are Experienced in Printing Costs Give Statements 
### R. W. Kenny, '21 
As the campaign for the Daily Palo Alto amendment comes to a close,
the number of its "friends in need" is hourly increasing. Yesterday saw
Skull and Snakes society come forth with an enthusiastic endorsement warm
ly backing the Daily's campaign for funds, and with the Skull and Snakes
resolution came in countless other endorsements of a similar nature, some
solicited, more not so, but all express sympathy with the Daily management
in its efforts to keep the standards of the Stanford newspaper equal to those
of Stanford itself.
But today, the last day of the campaign, these proffers of support reached
their high-water mark. They came pouring into the Daily office from all
concerns of the Universityâ€”from faculty members and students, from alumni
and friends of Stanford... To print them all would be a physical impossibility
and to do so in any case would be a monotonous procedure for they all were
unvarying in their stated convictions that the Daily should keep pace with the
progress of the University and that the students should not allow it to lag
behind because of the small Individual addition to registration fees.. <

--Unanimity of 1
Support
The list of those who have publicly
announced their support of the Daily
amendment is a long and representa
tive one proving that campus senti
ment is almost unanimously behind
the measure. Study of this list forms
a conclusive proof of this fact. It is
a perfectly safe statement to make
when one says that in campus history,
there has never been an issue before
a student vote which met with such an
unparalleled unanimity of support.
The oneness of student opinion, as evi
denced today, that the Daily should
be given the necessary finances to
continue its progress, makes the elec
tion almost a farce. Those who are
back of the Daily campaign are jubi
lant at the prospects of this landslide,
for they realize an overwhelming af
firmative vote is needed to impress
the Board of Trustees of the necessity
for the raise in tuition.
Landslide For
Measure
The history of the camaign reveals
the feet that the first published of
ficial support of the Daily campaign
came last Thursday when the five
journalistic societies of the campus
voiced their hearty approval of the
fifty-cent raise in tuition for Daily
funds. Friday's issue of the paper
was published with the statements
of many prominent students on the
tampus along with financial proof of
the necessity for a raise furnished by
the manager of the Daily, W. M. Davis,
'21, and W. A. Friend, the superin
tendent of -the University Press. The
sentiment expressed by the student
leaders was identical as far as sup
port of the Daily campaign went. They
could be well typified by the state
ment of W. T. Ames, '17, former gradu
ate manager, who said:
"I want to see the Daily Palo
Alto the best college paper on the
Pacific Coast. The students should
apply any additional funds neces
sary to meet the present emer
gency."
