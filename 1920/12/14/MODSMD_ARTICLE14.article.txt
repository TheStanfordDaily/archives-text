# UNITED PRESS SERVICE

### 
Certain criticism against the United Press service that The Daily
Palo Alto receives has arisen during the present campaign, and ques
tions have been asked about the advisability of running such news. The
only object is to place world news before students in condensed form so
that they will read it. There is always the charge made against the
college man that he is provincial; that he knows nothing beyond his own
classroom and campus. Leading university dailies are seeking to over
come this criticism by using condensed press dispatches, and the results
have been gratifying.
Stanford is situated so that a local newspaper does not circulate
on the campus, and the students are forced to depend on The Daily Palo
Alto and the city papers for the news. Students are enabled to get the
news of the day and the college news through The Daily before the
afternoon papers reach the campus.
If the proposed additional money is voted, the students will secure
The Daily for $1 for three months, while an afternoon city paper costs
$1.65 for three months.
The United Press feature is one of the strongest arguments that
the paper has in securing advertising. Its elimination would mean
the loss of a considerable number of contracts.
Eliminating the United Press service would not solve the financial
needs of the paper. Comptroller Roth's statement in today's issue shows
the increase which the paper is up against, and the necessity for reducing
if financial aid is not given.
