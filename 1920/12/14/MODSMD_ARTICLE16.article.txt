# MAJOR COLLINS HEADS LOCAL ARTILLERY UNIT
## 
### 
Having risen from the ranks him
self, Major Leroy P. Collins, head of
the Stanford Field Artillery Unit, is
a firm believer in the importancs and
value of a military training. His con
fidence in the superiority of the col
lege man in the army and navy is
equally as strong.
This confidence was his reason for
coming to Stanford in April 1918, to
establish the field artillery unit here.
He was in the office of General Snow,
Chief of the Field Artillery, when the
opportunity came. Major Collins
asked to be sent to Stanford because
of his keen interest and belief in the
work of the R. O. T. C.
"I would certainly advise any young
man who has the right inclination to
join either the army or navy," says
the major. "I have never been sorry
for a minute. There is a certain
prestige which goes with military rank
which any man enjoys. The thing
which disappoints me is the apparent
ignorance which so many Americans
have of their army. There are those
who are under the impression that an
officer's life in time of peace is not a
very active one. I can assure you
that it is."
Major Collins has worked from the
bottom up, having enlisted in the
ranks of the cavalry sixteen years ago,
after he l#ul graduated from Union
College in Schenectady, New York.
His military career has taken him to
many part sof the hemisphere. He
went to the Philippines for two years
in 1907, spent two and a half years in
Panama and some time in Costa Rica.

More recently he has been at Fort
Sill, Oklahoma, with the department
of recognizance, in the aviation school
at Camp Sheridan, Montgomery, Ala
bama, and with the 84th Field Ar
tillery Unit, in the Army War Col
lege at Washington, D. C. It was in
these camps that Major Collins had
occasion to study the comparative ef
ficiency of college trained and non
college trained soldiers.
In the twenty months that he has
been at Stanford as "Professor of
Military Science and Tactics," Major
Collins has done much for the military
department. Polo was begun under
his direction last spring with six
teams. This year the Board of Ath
letic Control has granted the sport
$250 for the equipment and the or
ganization of a number of teams will
start soon. The Girls' Equitation
Class, in which junior and senior wo
men may learn how to ride horseback,
will commence under his direction
next quarter.
The officer is a confessed "Cali
fornian," although he was born in
Troy, New York, and did not come
West until he vas sent to the Phil
lipines in 190'7. He attended Union
College in New York, which he char
acterizes as the "mother of the col
lege fraternity." While there he be
came a member of Phi Gamma Delta.
Stanford is ideally situated for field
artillery, according to the head of the
local unit, and he hopes that he will
be at Stanford at least three or four
more years to carry out some of the
plans which he has in mind.

ignorance which so many Americans
have of their army. There are those
who are under the impression that an
officer's life in time of peace is not a
very active one. I can assure you
that it is."
Major Collins has worked from the
bottom up, having enlisted in the
ranks of the cavalry sixteen years ago,
after he l#ul graduated from Union
College in Schenectady, New York.
His military career has taken him to
many part sof the hemisphere. He
went to the Philippines for two years
in 1907, spent two and a half years in
Panama and some time in Costa Rica.

More recently he has been at Fort
Sill, Oklahoma, with the department
of recognizance, in the aviation school
at Camp Sheridan, Montgomery, Ala
bama, and with the 84th Field Ar
tillery Unit, in the Army War Col
lege at Washington, D. C. It was in
these camps that Major Collins had
occasion to study the comparative ef
ficiency of college trained and non
college trained soldiers.
In the twenty months that he has
been at Stanford as "Professor of
Military Science and Tactics," Major
Collins has done much for the military
department. Polo was begun under
his direction last spring with six
teams. This year the Board of Ath
letic Control has granted the sport
$250 for the equipment and the or
ganization of a number of teams will
start soon. The Girls' Equitation
Class, in which junior and senior wo
men may learn how to ride horseback,
will commence under his direction
next quarter.
The officer is a confessed "Cali
fornian," although he was born in
Troy, New York, and did not come
West until he vas sent to the Phil
lipines in 190'7. He attended Union
College in New York, which he char
acterizes as the "mother of the col
lege fraternity." While there he be
came a member of Phi Gamma Delta.
Stanford is ideally situated for field
artillery, according to the head of the
local unit, and he hopes that he will
be at Stanford at least three or four
more years to carry out some of the
plans which he has in mind.
Having risen from the ranks him
self, Major Leroy P. Collins, head of
the Stanford Field Artillery Unit, is
a firm believer in the importancs and
value of a military training. His con
fidence in the superiority of the col
lege man in the army and navy is
equally as strong.
This confidence was his reason for
coming to Stanford in April 1918, to
establish the field artillery unit here.
He was in the office of General Snow,
Chief of the Field Artillery, when the
opportunity came. Major Collins
asked to be sent to Stanford because
of his keen interest and belief in the
work of the R. O. T. C.
"I would certainly advise any young
man who has the right inclination to
join either the army or navy," says
the major. "I have never been sorry
for a minute. There is a certain
prestige which goes with military rank
which any man enjoys. The thing
which disappoints me is the apparent
ignorance which so many Americans
have of their army. There are those
who are under the impression that an
officer's life in time of peace is not a
very active one. I can assure you
that it is."
