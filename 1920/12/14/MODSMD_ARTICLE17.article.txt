That Kingscote ad. had just ceased
to afford ye ed. chills of horror, when
he noticed another fearful paragraph
in ye Classified Ads. which smites his
eyesight and numbs his senses. Said
ad. reads as follows: "RUTH —I've
tried but I can't find you. What is
your last name? I'm over 18, eligible
nad anxious." What do you think this
is, Anon., a matrimonial bureau?
Yeah, an' he says ho-'s over eighteen,
eligible and anxious. He's over anxi
ous allriglit, and eligible to the owner
ship of the Marachino gooseberries.

"Aha." said the kangaroo to the
frog. I've got the jump on you."

The bards all sing and poets write
and people always talk a sight of how
the world ought to be run.
But when it comes right down to
tacks these birds have always got an
ax for you to grind for fun.
They like to howl and rant and
storm about some new kind of reform
that doesn't stack deuce high.
They want to amputate the booze,
eliminate the snore from snooze and
take the kick from rye.
They all line up against the wets
and put the ban on cigarettes; the
limit is the sky.
A man can't click the bones no
more, reform cre's hangin' on the
door; all we can do is howl.
There ain't no use of makin' kicks,
you might as well be in the Styx for
what comes from a howl.
But all the birds that put this
through for lack of somethin' else
to do are settin' keen for good.
They've got a line on all the cops,
they keep a cellar full of hops; they'd
have more if they could.
If drinkin' makes their breath smell
bum, they chew i piece of Goldmint
gum and look as big as life.
Then stand around with glum as
pect and cakalate the world is wreck
ed, and go and beat the wife.
If I was runnin' this here land, I'd
make these birds put on the sand, and
open up the door.
I'd stop this reformation now, and
put these yaps on prison chow and
maybe stint 'em more.
I'd take a joy in holdin' out and
hearin' all the suffers shout. I'd like
to have a try.
If I could set and cut and carve and
let the yokels howl and starve, I'd be
satisfied to die.
—Anti's Antithesis.
