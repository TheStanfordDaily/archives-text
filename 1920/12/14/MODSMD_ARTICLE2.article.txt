# DECEMBER CARDINAL CONTAINS STORY OF "LIBRE BELGIQUE"
## 
### 
"A fascinating story which is un
paralleled in the history of newspaper
adventure" is the comment of a San
Francisco literary critic on "The
Story of the Libre Belgique" which
will be published in the December
number of the Stanford Cardinal. The
four years of occupation of Belgium
by the Boche has left many epics of
heroism but none of them has more
interest to the American reader than
the tale of the publication of the "Free
Belgium."
Denied the right of sale or circula
tion by the German invaders who
raided their printing shops, imprisoned
their editors and arrested their sub
scribers, a staunch band of Belgians
printed the "Libre Belgique" for four
years in the face of seemingly insur
mountable difficulties. Robert C. Bink
ley, assistant to Professor E. D.
Adams in resear h work on the Hoov
er Library, writes the story of the un
usual journal, from an intimate knowl
edge of Belgium during the days when
the Boche were vainly attempting to
suppress the "Libre Belgique."
"A College Man's Holiday," is the
title of the leading story of the De
cember Cardinal. A Stanford graduate
whose name is familiar to all story
readers is the author of the sketch
which is signed "Anonymous." There
is little in the story to suggest the
ordinary type of Christmas tales. It
is a narrative of startling contrasts
and unexpected conclusions woven
around the fourteen days which a
Stanford man spent in a vain attempt
to catch the gladness of the holidays.
