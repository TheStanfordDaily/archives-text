SHANGHAI, Dee. 14.—Foreign and
native police departments tlirough-out
China are engaged in a hunt today
that involves a story as weird as any
of those told in Sax Romer's Oriental
tales. A green jade jewel which has
a history as sinister as that of the
Hope diamond has disappeared. Its
latest owner escaped death, after
being shot through the head and is
spending thousands in an endeavor
to recover the gem.
Woo Sing-fauog, owner of a tiny
shop in the exclusive Bubbling Well
district, is a dealer in rare gems. How
he came to possess the fateful jewel
known in Chinese as "The Jade," he
refuses to disclose.
A short time ago a well dressed
stranger, apparently an American, en
tered the shop and asked to see the
choicest jewels. The shopkeeper be
lieved his customer o be a man of
wealth and suggested that he obtain
some rarer articles than those on dis
play. The foreigner agreed and an ap
pointment was made for the next day.
When the customer kept the ap
pointment, the merchant brought forth
necklaces and unmounted jade of rare
value. From the lot the foreigner se
lected jewels valued at Taels 5,000
(about $7,000). He then requested the
jeweler to accompany him to his home
nearby, where the transaction would
be completed.
"Wait," urged the merchant, "there
is one more piece I want you to see."
It was "The Jade."
The customer's eyes glistened. He
asked the price. The merchant sug
gested that they discuss that matter
when they reached the foreigner's
home. He has since admitted that
because he had learned the history
of the jewel he wanted to be rid of it
at almost any price. From the day
of an early emperor, long before the
Ming Dynasty, a path of blood has
followed the sinister bit of green.
Woo had been brooding over what he
believeu to be the fate that overhung
him and believed he saw an opportun
ity of disposing of it and at the same
time lining his pockcts with gold.
The pair departed for the foreigner's
home in ricslias. It lias since been
discovered that the customer's convey
ance was drawn by an accomplice, dis
guised as a coolie.
Arriving at a pretentious dwelling,
owned by a wealthy resident of the
International Settlement, the mer
chant was invited to enter. They
passed through the gates. A shot was
heard and the stranger and his ac
complice disappeared before the police
could reach the scene.
With them went "The Jade" and the
other jewels.
