TOKYO, Dec. 14.—As Japan pro
ceeds to adopt western customs, the
old usage of having parents chose
husbands or brides for their offspring
is gradually falling into disuse. In
many cases the young people prefer
to depend on the dictates of their
hearts rather than upon the brains o£
their parents.
The activities of marriage agencies
are also becoming quite common, as
has been shown by a police investiga
tion made recently in Tokyo, when the
affairs of thirty of these bureaus of
Cupid were looked into.
