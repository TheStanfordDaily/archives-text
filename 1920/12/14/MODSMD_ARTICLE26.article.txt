It seems that in the present campaign
for an increased assessment for the
D. P. A., only one side of the issue has
heen voiced, and if the students are to
.vote intelligently both sides should be
presented. For that reason I dare to
present the following remarks, express
ing not my personal opinion but that of
a large group of Stanford students; not
in an attempt to defeat the measure, but
simply to make the issue more clear.
The D. P. A. has thus far three out
standing arguments: that the manage
ment is facing a period of falling prices
entailing a contraction of advertising,
and at the same time a period of rising
prices which will increase its cost; that
Stanford should publish as "big" a
paper as other universities of the coun
try regardless of whether or not she has
the news to fill it; that the use of the
United Press telegraphic dispatches has
added a new and substantial expense.
The first argument, if the facts upon
which it is based are true, should of
course carry some weight; but it would
seem to be a fair assumption that a
business depression sufficient to produce
a marked effect upon the local advei
tising field would be felt shortly in the
markets which directly concern the D.
P. A. It is common knowledge that the
print paper shortage was not as real as
it was claimed to be. At least a deficit
of only $250 hardly seems to warrant
an increase of 100 per cent in assess
ment. An expected business depression
is at least a queer argument for a price
raise.
But the objections that I hear voicea
are against the principle underlying this
and other requests for increased assess
ments. Shall Stanford attempt to com
pete in the size and quantity of her
activities with other universities two and
three times as big by special assessments
upon the student body in the nature of
subsidies to those activities?
A newspaper exists, as far as I know,
to present news and for no other pur
pose, and the amount of news is the
only consideration that should determine
: ts size. It is only reasonable that a
school of 8,000 students should have
more news to print than a school of
2.500, and need more space to print it in.
A careful perusal of last night's D. P.
4. will present the fact that the local
and intercollegiate news covered less
than one page. A smaller paper would
only make it easier to find this news.
As to the cost of the United Press, it
has been the opinion of every student 1
have spoken with that it is money
thrown away. And they object to being
taxed to subsidize a college daily in its
attempt to compete with four metro
politan dailies. It is argued that the
D. P. A. informs students that do not
read the dailies of outside news; but
the same ca nbe accomplished in better
fashion through a summary of the news
of the morning press written by some
member of the staff. The facts of the
case are that the students do not read
the telegraphic news because they have
already read it twelve hours before, or
else are not interested. The students
want to know whether or not the 1). P.
A. can survive the present stringency by
the elimination of the United Press
news.
It is time that Stanford learned her
limitations and concentrated upon those
things she can do well instead of spread
ing her efforts over too wide a field to
the detriment of her reputation. This is
applicable to the present situation.»

presented. For that reason I dare to
present the following remarks, express
ing not my personal opinion but that of
a large group of Stanford students; not
in an attempt to defeat the measure, but
simply to make the issue more clear.
The D. P. A. has thus far three out
standing arguments: that the manage
ment is facing a period of falling prices
entailing a contraction of advertising,
and at the same time a period of rising
prices which will increase its cost; that
Stanford should publish as "big" a
paper as other universities of the coun
try regardless of whether or not she has
the news to fill it; that the use of the
United Press telegraphic dispatches has
added a new and substantial expense.
The first argument, if the facts upon
which it is based are true, should of
course carry some weight; but it would
seem to be a fair assumption that a
business depression sufficient to produce
a marked effect upon the local advei
tising field would be felt shortly in the
markets which directly concern the D.
P. A. It is common knowledge that the
print paper shortage was not as real as
it was claimed to be. At least a deficit
of only $250 hardly seems to warrant
an increase of 100 per cent in assess
ment. An expected business depression
is at least a queer argument for a price
raise.
But the objections that I hear voicea
are against the principle underlying this
and other requests for increased assess
ments. Shall Stanford attempt to com
pete in the size and quantity of her
activities with other universities two and
three times as big by special assessments
upon the student body in the nature of
subsidies to those activities?
A newspaper exists, as far as I know,
to present news and for no other pur
pose, and the amount of news is the
only consideration that should determine
: ts size. It is only reasonable that a
school of 8,000 students should have
more news to print than a school of
2.500, and need more space to print it in.
A careful perusal of last night's D. P.
4. will present the fact that the local
and intercollegiate news covered less
than one page. A smaller paper would
only make it easier to find this news.
As to the cost of the United Press, it
has been the opinion of every student 1
have spoken with that it is money
thrown away. And they object to being
taxed to subsidize a college daily in its
attempt to compete with four metro
politan dailies. It is argued that the
D. P. A. informs students that do not
read the dailies of outside news; but
the same ca nbe accomplished in better
fashion through a summary of the news
of the morning press written by some
member of the staff. The facts of the
case are that the students do not read
the telegraphic news because they have
already read it twelve hours before, or
else are not interested. The students
want to know whether or not the 1). P.
A. can survive the present stringency by
the elimination of the United Press
news.
It is time that Stanford learned her
limitations and concentrated upon those
things she can do well instead of spread
ing her efforts over too wide a field to
the detriment of her reputation. This is
applicable to the present situation.»

It seems that in the present campaign
for an increased assessment for the
D. P. A., only one side of the issue has
heen voiced, and if the students are to
.vote intelligently both sides should be
presented. For that reason I dare to
present the following remarks, express
ing not my personal opinion but that of
a large group of Stanford students; not
