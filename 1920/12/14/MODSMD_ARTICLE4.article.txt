# LEAGUE DECIDES ON APPEAL FOR TRADE REVISION
## All Nations Will Be Asked To Restrict Manufacture of Arms and Ammunition 
### United Press 
GENEVA, Dec. 14.—The League of
Nations, through an appeal to all na
tions, will endeavor to restrict trade in
arms and ammunitions, it was decided
today in the assembly.
The disarmament commission declared
it was impossible for the powers to live
up to the armament restriction revision
of the St. Germain treaty, when the
United States was free to manufactuie
and sell ammunition. Delegates declared
it would be an unwarranted action on
manufacturing in other countries to pro
hibit their manufacture while Americano
extended their commerce.
The assembly authorized the League
Council to make every effort to have ail
nations, including the United States,
ratify the armed trade restriction.
It was decided to ask all nations noi
to exceed their current military, naval,
and air budgets in the next two years,
during which period it was hoped an
international plan would be accepted.
Vote Yes—lt's Imperative
