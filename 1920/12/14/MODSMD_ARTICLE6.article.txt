# SWIMMING OVER FOR QUARTER; OUTLOOK IS BRIGHT NEXT SEASON
## 
### 
Swimming activities have closed foi
the quarter with the approach of finals.
This afternoon was the last for the
making up of cuts, and with it the last
of the classes in fancy diving are sus
pended until after the New Year.
During the quarter just passed the
Stanford mermen have been playing in
hard luck. Attention to study has kept
most of the swimmers from activity in
the pool, and while the aquatic sport
has had the biggest turnout of all the
required athletics, there has been a
handicap through the esason. Among
the freshmen some men have showed up
who seem to be in line for varsity ma
terial in the next year, and will prob
ably take a place among the winners in
the spring meet with the California
Babes. Charlie Fletcher, the breast
stroke champion from San Diego, has
bettered his form and is getting con
sistently fatser than he was when he
came here. He is now doing the hun
dred breast stroke in time that ought
to take that event in the freshman inter
collegiate meet.
Erny Brandsten has developed in
White a diver of considerable potential
merit. Wnitc has class and is perfecting
his technique in the individual dives until
he ranks with the best of the older
varsity men.
Most of the varsity men will be bactc
at work by the beginning of next quar
ter, and although there is little activity
in the aquatic line during the cold
months of the winter they will keep in
practice for the big meets that come in
the spring. In the spring vacation the
mermen will take a trip to the South
and will meet all clubs in and around
Los Angeles. They will be the guests
ot the Los Angeles Athletic Club loi
some time and then will go to San Diego
to meet the swimmers of that city.
They will meet the Pasadena High
School and Hollywood. The freshmen
have several off-campus trips that wil 1
take them to the bay cities to meet some
of the fastest of the junior organiza
tions.
