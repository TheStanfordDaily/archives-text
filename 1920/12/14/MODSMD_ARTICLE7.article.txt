# COACH MAKES CUT IN BASKETBALL SQUAD
## Number of Varsity Candidates Is Reduced to Twenty-one; Final Team Will Be Sixteen 
### 
Twenty-one candidates are now fight
ing for places on the 1921 varsity bas
ketball squad which will be chosen at the
first of next quarter. The number of
men that appeared for varsity practice
early in the season was cut last night to
twenty-one. The final squad will be made
up of sixteen of the following men:
Righter, Mills, Davies, Adams, Rich
mond, Patrick, Neer, Ralph Carver, Lar
son, Kraft, Fchren, Pollard, L. L. Car
ver, Lacey, Anderson, Gerson, Rogers,
Debenham, Neill, SteindorfF, and Lind
strom. It is still doubtful whether or
not Austin will return next quarter.
Several of the non-letter men are
crowding the veterans of last yeai's
squad for their positions on the quintei.
Righter is probably the only varsity
candidate that is definitely assured of
his old place on the first string five.
Although the Cardinal is missing two
of last season's forwards, the offensive
end of the court is strong enough to
meet any basketball team on the coast.
Davies, Mills, Righter, and Richmona,
along with the new material out for the
squad, will hold their own in goal shoot
ing.
The defensive end of the Stanford
squad has been materially weakened by
the loss of Captain-elect Butt, who
failed to return to Stanford this year.
Adams will work at the standing guara
position, while the running guard posi
tion will be left open for one of the non
varsity men. At preesnt Larsen looks
like the bets bet for this position, al
though Coach Powell has several men
in tow that look like comers for the
job of running guard.
