# FACULTY MEMBERS ENDORSE "DAILY" FUNDS CAMPAIGN
## Men in Touch With Student Activities Recognize Importance of Amendment 
### 
Approval of the increase in subscrip
tion rates for The Daily Palo Alto is
being given not only by leaders of stu
dent opinion, but by members of the
faculty, whose observation of the Daily
has extended over a number of years.
The proposal, without exception, ha.;
been endorsed by faculty members who
are actively in touch with student activi
ties.
"For years I have taken a great inter
est in the tone and growth of Stanford
journalism," declares George B. Lulvci,
Dean of Men. "More recently in con
nection with my official duties I have
come to appreciate the usefulness of The
Daily Palo Alto. I therefore heartily
approve any plan whereby, without too
great a financial burden on the stndents,
the Daily may be able to augment the
great service it already renders."
Professor Charles M. Marx is em
phatic in his approval of the proposed
increase. "I am very strongly in favor
of the mesure. The need for it is self
evident. Due to the increased cost of
paper and printing, the Daily, as well as
other publications, must turn to new
sources of revenue. My experience with
the Journal of the American Engineers'
Association has revealed to me the new
expenses which publications everywhere
must meet. The advance of rates for the
Daily is imperative."
An affirmative vote should he cast in
the clcction in the opinion of Professor
Murray S. Wildman, who declares that
"the student body of Stanford needs a
daily paper, and it is impossible to have
it if the present price, which does not
cover the cost of publication, is noi
increased. 1 should think that the stu
dctn would vote for an increase if it i a
shown that it is necessary, as I believe
that it is."
Dorothy Johnson, '21, president of the
Women's Conference, hopes to see the
"500" back the measure. ' 'Isee no valid
reason," she says, "to object to the pro
posed increase. The importance of main
taining The Daily Palo Alto with stand
ards favorable to the newspapers of
other universities is easily recognized.''
