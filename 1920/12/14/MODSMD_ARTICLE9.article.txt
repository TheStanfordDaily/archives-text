.Tomorrow Stanford men and women will decide whether they want
the Daily Palo Alto to continue on its pesent basis as a standard uni
versity daily paper, or reduce to the size of a handbill.
The future of the paper is entirely in the hands of the students.
To add 50 cents to the registration fee requires thought on the part of
every student, and The Daily is asking this money only as a last resort.
It is not a good precedent to set, but there is no other alternative.
Either the student body must pay the additional money or the paper will
be forced to reduce.
During the present quarter, the Daily went into the hole to the
extent of $125 a month. Beginning the first of next quarter, according
to the superintendent of the University Press it will cost $125 more a
month to print the paper, due to an increase in printer's wages which
goes into effect January 1. Under this increase, unless the additional
money is voted, the Daily will go in the hole $250 each month next
quarter. Had this increase been in effect this quarter, the deficit would
now be $625.
„ It is clear that no paper can continue publication under these con
ditions.
In order to assure students that the funds voted will not be mis
used, the Executive Committee of the Associated Students will collect
the money and hold it in trust for the Daily Palo Alto. As the man
agement of the paper shows that it is in need of aid, the Executive
Committee will disburse the money to meet the needs of the paper.
At the end of each quarter, if a surplus remains after the needs
of the Daily have been met, it reverts to the Associated Students. There
is no opportunity for the paper to accumulate a big surplus which would
enable the manager to cease work, and let the paper run on the students'
money.
When the Daily is not in need of more aid, and its advertising
revenues and present circulation money are sufficient to meet expenses
again, the Board of Trustees can, on recommendation by the President,
cancel the tax, or any part of it.
It is not possible to estimate how high the expenses will run in the
immediate future, and so the sum requested has been set high enough to
meet the probable expcfises. If as is pointed out in the preceding para
graph, the Daily does not need all of the money, or it regains its normal
financial condition, the fee can be cancelled.
A further guarantee has been included in the proposition to be
voted on. It provides that the editor and manager shall be placed on
a flat salary to be determined by the Executive Committee, and they shall
receive no bonus. This eliminates the chance of cither official securing
a "cut" out of a possible surplus.
The student body is given absolute guarantee by the above pro
visions that the money will not be misused, and that as soon as practic
able, the tax will be cancelled.
If the measure fails, the result is only too clearly seen. Stanford
will have a daily paper that will not bear comparison with the other
university dailies on the Coast. The majority of high schools in the
State get both the Daily Palo Alto and the publications of the other
universities. The conclusions that prospective students will draw from
comparisons can lie easily imagined.
It is most important that every single Stanford student vote to
morrow. The Board of Trustees will only be convinced of the senti
ment of the students by the size of the majority.
Make your vote count.

comparisons can lie easily imagined.
It is most important that every single Stanford student vote to
morrow. The Board of Trustees will only be convinced of the senti
ment of the students by the size of the majority.
Make your vote count.
.Tomorrow Stanford men and women will decide whether they want
the Daily Palo Alto to continue on its pesent basis as a standard uni
versity daily paper, or reduce to the size of a handbill.
The future of the paper is entirely in the hands of the students.
To add 50 cents to the registration fee requires thought on the part of
every student, and The Daily is asking this money only as a last resort.
It is not a good precedent to set, but there is no other alternative.
Either the student body must pay the additional money or the paper will
be forced to reduce.
During the present quarter, the Daily went into the hole to the
extent of $125 a month. Beginning the first of next quarter, according
to the superintendent of the University Press it will cost $125 more a
month to print the paper, due to an increase in printer's wages which
goes into effect January 1. Under this increase, unless the additional
money is voted, the Daily will go in the hole $250 each month next
quarter. Had this increase been in effect this quarter, the deficit would
now be $625.
„ It is clear that no paper can continue publication under these con
ditions.
In order to assure students that the funds voted will not be mis
used, the Executive Committee of the Associated Students will collect
the money and hold it in trust for the Daily Palo Alto. As the man
agement of the paper shows that it is in need of aid, the Executive
Committee will disburse the money to meet the needs of the paper.
At the end of each quarter, if a surplus remains after the needs
of the Daily have been met, it reverts to the Associated Students. There
is no opportunity for the paper to accumulate a big surplus which would
enable the manager to cease work, and let the paper run on the students'
money.
When the Daily is not in need of more aid, and its advertising
revenues and present circulation money are sufficient to meet expenses
again, the Board of Trustees can, on recommendation by the President,
cancel the tax, or any part of it.
It is not possible to estimate how high the expenses will run in the
immediate future, and so the sum requested has been set high enough to
meet the probable expcfises. If as is pointed out in the preceding para
graph, the Daily does not need all of the money, or it regains its normal
financial condition, the fee can be cancelled.
A further guarantee has been included in the proposition to be
voted on. It provides that the editor and manager shall be placed on
a flat salary to be determined by the Executive Committee, and they shall
receive no bonus. This eliminates the chance of cither official securing
a "cut" out of a possible surplus.
The student body is given absolute guarantee by the above pro
visions that the money will not be misused, and that as soon as practic
able, the tax will be cancelled.
If the measure fails, the result is only too clearly seen. Stanford
will have a daily paper that will not bear comparison with the other
university dailies on the Coast. The majority of high schools in the
State get both the Daily Palo Alto and the publications of the other
universities. The conclusions that prospective students will draw from
comparisons can lie easily imagined.
