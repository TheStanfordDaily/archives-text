Foot-wear for
Formal Occasions
As we approach the holiday season with all its social
functions and "affairs" the demand for Dress Foot
wear increases at Herold's perceptibly. This year
we are exceptionally well prepared, the displays in
both the Men's and Women's departments being
larger and more complete.
Dress Oxfords for Men
Of especial interest in the Men's Department just

that is as comfortable as it is good-looking. The
