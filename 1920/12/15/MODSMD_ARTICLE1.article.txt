# AMENDMENT FOR FUNDS FOR DAILY PALO ALTO DEFEATED BY STUDENTS
## Opposition is Organized at Last Minute and Measure Meets Defeat in Record Vote 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto amendment to
add 50 cents to the registration fees
each quarter to meet a financial crisis
was defeated by a student body vote
today, 871 to 181. The total vote of
1,052 was an unusually large vote. The
men's vote was: No, 766; Yes, 118.
The women's vote was: No, 105; Yes,
63. Polls closed at 2 o'clock this after
noon.

Since the announcement made last
Thursday that the measure would be put
to a student vote, interest on both sides
has 'been keen. Although prominent
members of the student body and the
faculty went 011 record as favoring
the amendment, opposition was persist
ent. This opposition gained strength at

llie last minute, resulting in the loss of
the measure.
Representatives of The Daily Palo
Alto went before the Executive Com
mittee last Tuesday evening and pre
sented the situation, showing tliaf the
financial status of the paper was acute.
The committee agreed to put the matter
of adding 50 cents to registration fees
to a student body vote. Friday after
noon, in order to meet certain opposi
tion. the wording of the amendment wao
changed at the request of Daily repre
sentatives.

Opposition seemed to be based mainly
011 the contentions that the need for
more money was not reai, and that add
ing 50 cents to the registartion fees was
establishing a poor precedent.
