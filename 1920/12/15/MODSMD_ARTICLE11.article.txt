# GERMANY DISCUSSED BY PROFESSOR RENDTORFF
## Military Power of Country Is No Longer World Danger Declares Faculty Member 
### 
"Germany as a military power Is
crushed; the array and navy are so
small that there is no danger what
ever." This is one of the important
facts brought out by Professor K. G.
Rendtorff in an interview yesterday,
in which he gave many interesting
facts concerning present conditions,
social, economic, and military, in the
new Germany that is striving to rise
vi'rom the ruin left by the world war.
Professor Rendtorff, who left for a
trip to Germany last July, has just
returned, and during his four months'
visit, was able to get the viewpoints
and the facts of present-day Germany.
Taking up first the military aspects
of the situation, Professor Rendtorff
declared that "Germany as a military
power is a thing of the past. The
army has been decreased from 4,000,-
000' men to 100,000; there are no fly
ing machines for this army; and the
Krupp works are making bed-steads
instead of munitions. Germany is
helpless and she knows it." Speaking
of the talk concerning the possible
restoration of the royal line, he said
that there "is no danger of the Hohen
zollerns ever coming back." The peo
ple abhor any kind of militarism, and
are working hard to make their new
government a success.
"Revolution did not bring chaos —
in spite of the revolution ,the func
tions of government were carried on
just the same," Professor Rendtorff
stated, and added that Germany has
"an extremely well thought out and
liberal constitution, and seems to have
a stable government, representative of
the majority of the nation, especially
the middle class." The middle class,
he said, i> the saving in Germany
and "the mass of the people are too
well-balanced" for any radical revolu
tion to become effective. The /danger
that faces Germany is the danger
that her middle class, the class that
is "the balance wheel of any nation,"
may be,crushed.
Coming to the economic side of life,
Professor Rendtorff declared that "the
conditions over there are pitiful. The
increase of tuberculosis is appalling,"
mul this condition is especially acute
pmong the children. Milk is scarce,
am? coal is lacking.
But although economic conditions
are very bad! he stated that there is
much hope in the sound political or
ganization of the present government.
The trouble before was that "even
the most educated man was willing to
trust the government to do every
thing," while now the Social Demo
crats, who are in control, are well
educated politically. Germany will be
an influence for good, declared Pro
fessor Rendtorff, if the new forces
prevail, but we must give her time—
the hopeful feature of her situation
is that the "willingness to work, on
which the future life of the nation de
pends, si remarkable both in the way
of business and in the way of science
and art."
