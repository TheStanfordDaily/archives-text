# SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS A QUARTER WILL BE TUITION FEE BEGINNING NEXT OCTOBER, ANNOUNCES WILBUR
## Advanced, Tuition Affects Only Students Entering Oct. 1, 1921 
### 
Stanford University has been hit by the housing shortage. With no
other way available to overcome the crippling effect of inadequate living
accommodations for both students and faculty, the University will increase
the tuition fee for all new students entering next Octobor and afterwards
from $40 to $75 a quarter —unless in tlie meantime it receives an addition
of $4,000,000 to its endowment, which would meet the crisis. The increase
will not affect students now in college.
This announcement was made today by President Wilbur in a state
ment which details the conditions which have forced the Board of Trus
tees to take this step and presents the program which has been adopted to
provide sufficient living quarters for students and faculty and dining ac
commodations for the students.
Men students were this year forced to live three and four in a room
in the dormitories and the families of Palo Alto had to be appealed to to
•open their homes to students.

There are not enough houses on the
campus for the faculty and the pres
sure on Palo Alto from San Francisco
and through local demand has cut off
the opportunity for many professors
to live in Palo Alto as they formerly
did. The campus situation will be
made harder through the retirement
within a few years of a number of
professors and the need to bring
others to the University to fill their
positions. Pracflically aUI the pro
fessors who have retired have con
tinued to occupy their campus and
Palo Alto homes.
The program of the University
contemplates the provision of dining
and other facilities for the men of
Encina Hall, the building of new re
sidence and dining halls for 480 men
and for 200 women, and the establish
ment of a quarter-million dollar fund
to aid faculty members through long
time loans to build homes on the
campus.

To make it possible for students un
able to meet the tuition fee to attend
the University, the Trustees have ar
ranged to accept such students' pro
missory notes, which will run for
seven years before they begin to bear
interest. A self-supporting fctudent
can therefore have three years after
graduation in which to establish his
earning power before he begins to
repay the loans and can then pay the
money at the same intervals as he
would in college without any interest
charges.

dowment" has brought no results.
Stanford alumni are unable to provide
money as the graduates of older in
stitutions have during similar crisis
which have confronted all American
universities. He expresses the hope,
however, that Stanford men and wo
men may establish scholarships for
the benefit of residents of their home
districts, so that the University will
receive such students selected by
Stanford people.

I)r. Wilbur points out that this ad
ditional tuition fee will not permit any
expansion of the University student
body but is required to enable Stan
ford to meet the bare requirements in
living facilities of its present restrict
ed student body. In closing he calls
attention to the fact that the pres
ent methods of selecting students for
admission are not satisfactory and
must be revised. He closes with a
statement of the University's determi
nation to remain small in size "and
to devote the fullest attention to those
admitted, so that it will continue to
turn out thoroughly trained students
with sound and democratic ideas of
citizenship." ,
The President's statement in full
follows:
December 15, 1920.
Stanford University has had to meet
a new crisis in its affairs due to the
many growing needs of the University,
the high costs .of living, the underpaid
siaff, and the housing shortage for
both students and professors. Since
they cannot appeal for a special tax
and there are certain limitations to
the Trust, the Stanford Trustees have
decided that, unless an increase in
general endowments of $4,000,000 is
made in the form of gifts, beginning
with October, 1921, tuition fees for
new students entering the Unhersity
for the first time will be $75 per quar
ter. A method of deferred payments
for students working their way will
be established so that payment for
tuition in approved cases may be made
by seven-year note# bearing no inter
est until maturity. No change in tui
tion fees will be made for such stu
dents now registered/in the University.
The University authorities have
made an earnest effort to secure fur
ther endowment, bu the Stanford
alumni body is too young to make the
large contribution necessary and the
time is not propitious for a public en
dowment campaign. It is anticipated
that some of the Alumni will be able
to provide scholarships covering at
least tuition fees and It is hoped that
a number of geographical scholarships
will be founded by friends of the Uni
versity so that all of the counties in
California and most of the states can
be represented by students at Stan-
