# FRESHMEN CUT IN BASKETBALL
## Twenty-four Men are Selected To Compele for Places on Regular Team Next Quarter 
### 
After more than two weeks of hard
practice the freshman basketball try
outees were cut to a squad of twenty
four members last night. The smaller
number will facilitate the handling of
the men, will allow a specialization, and
a chance to organize fives for better
team work. These are the things that
the team, this far in the game, seems to
lack.

Coach Seay, of the freshman squad,
was pleased with the quality And the
quantity of the men that turned out to
make a try for the team, and although
this cut is not final, the men now out
are all freshmen varsity material. He
stated that there would be another cut
in the squad about the third week in the
next quarter, which would cut the num
ber of men down to about fifteen or
sixteen. The team is still open to new
tryoutees and the coach requests that
all freshmen who have played the garni
and who have not tried out because of
some other sport or because they are
just entering college, see him as soon as
possible in order that he may find out
their playing ability. The campus will
be combed for all new material, and
anyone knowing of new students who
are good players is asked to inform the
coach at the earliest possible moment.
A tight race was made for all the
different positions" and the men who
stayed on the squad were given keen
competition during the entire time in
which they tried out.
Up to this time the freshmen have
been practicing at night, leaving the
afternoons open for varsity practice.
Now. however, they arc practicing in
the. afternoons from 4 to 5. The fresh
