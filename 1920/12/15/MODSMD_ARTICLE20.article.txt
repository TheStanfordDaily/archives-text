# A 						RICH MAN'S COLLEGE
## 
### 
The big question that arises after the announcement of the increased
tuition fee is whether Stanford will become a rich man's college. The
thought is repugnant to everyone who has the welfare of Stanford at
heart and the desire to see this institution continue as a university where
the poor man as well as the rich can secure his education. If the size
of a man's pocketbook is going to be the qualification to enter Stanford,
then apparently Stanford is doomed as a democratic college for Western
men.
In making their decision on the increase of tuition, the Trustees
were confronted with the question as to whether Stanford is to expand
or not, and the fact that if Stanford is to take care of her proportion of
the educational duty of the State, and do it right, and maintain her high
standards, more money must be obtained. The Trustees decided for
expansion, and that the incoming students must pay for it.
The increased fee would not be necessary if contraction were
decided upon. Contraction would mean the elimination of certain de
partments that are now supported by the University. The faculty would
be cut, and some of the most valuable of the faculty members would be
forced 'to retire because of the failure to receive salary increases. Some
of the departments would have to be eliminated, and the result would
be that Stanford would fall into the class of the second rate colleges.
Our educational as well as our athletic standards would have to suffer.
Would contraction and no tuition fee offset the risk of Stanford
becoming a rich man's university?
In the opinion of The Daily Palo Alto, it would not. This paper is
for expansion, and a bigger and a better Stanford, and we will have
to run the risk of becoming a university for rich men.
However, we do not approve of the money that has been put in the
Stanford Medical School, and believe that it could have been used to
better advantage on the campus. We do not approve of the project to
house all men in one central area, necessitating the erection of numerous
houses or dormitories, and believe that this money could be used much
better in creating more departments, or put into salary increases.
Nevertheless, the University must go ahead, and not back. And it
must meet the problem of a probable change in the character of students
the best that it can.
It will be up to the alumni to decide whether the personnel of the
University will change. President Wilbur recommends that scholar
ships be established by alumni for students who will be forced to work
their way. If this suggestion is adopted, the problem will be solved to
some extent, and perhaps finally. It will also be the duty of the alumni
and the present students to point out the opportunity for entering
students to take out seven-year notes without interest until date of
maurity. These plans may or may not offset the risk of the whole
character of the institution changing, but it is better to run this risk
than have a second rate University.
