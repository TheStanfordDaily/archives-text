SPARKS—
Seems to be a current impression
among ye Sparks perusers that this
colyum is conducted on the clipping
basis. 'Taint. Ed. received a com
munication the other day in answer
to this S. O. S., which included a
bunch of second-hand humor from the
Broadway something-or-other. Much
obliged, anonymous communicant, but
it can't be use. Said Sparks are
original. As Johnny would say, "no
body else would think of anything
quite so foolish.

Bill wants to know what our chil
dren are going to do about the in
creased tuition. Upon being informed
that students now enrolled will not be
be affected by the additional boost,
Bill remarks that we'll all have to put
our kids through sooner or later any-
Way.

That classified ad addressed to Ruth
has been hastily and surreptiously
withdrawn for some reason or other.
Possibly modesty prompted the move,
but we are inclined to believe that the
bird who wrote the article has found
Ruth through ye Classy colyum. That's
efficiency, Ichabod, that's efficiency.
One-day service, that's us.

It's a good thing that people don't
get imprisoned for debt any more, or
with the increase in tuition the per
centage of future Stanford people in
the jug would astonish the figure
, jugglers.

Ex-Cabbage Ed. is going into the
flower business. Says a florist gave
him a job ringing the alarm every
time the century plant came into
bloom. Next thing We know he'll be
sseiling bellows at bullfights.

You tell 'em feather-bed, you've got
a soft position.

Politic hounds say that the people
don't think. From the way the Daily's
four-bit raise seems to hit the Stan
ford public, there's more thinkin' goin'
on than is good for the proposed
amendment.

One of the our professors who has
just returned from Germany publishes
a atory on that country's social and
political situation in today's issue. He
declares that Germany has a stable
government.
N.B. —No wonder, its President is a
harness-maker.

WILL SOMEONE PUT OUT THE
CAT AND THE LIGHTS?
