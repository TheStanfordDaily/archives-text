### United Press 
' DETROIT, Dec. 14.—Realization of
r the real benefits of a plan of city
t owned street railways—preached for
3 many years by both economists and
j political aspirants—is to be had in
t Detroit within a short time after the
3 first of next year.
Mayor Jameß Couzens, millionaire,
r former partner of Henry Ford in the
Ford Motor Company, was one of the
first of the many candidates for high
. city offices to really put into working
. the plan for a municipality owned
j street car system. The question was
> put to a vote and overwhelmingly
adopted. It is proposed to charge five
t cents on the lines.
It was agreed the movement would
entail an expediture of fifteen mil
lions of dollars and plans were made
i for several bond issues to get the
y needed money. The first bond issue
>, was made a few weeks ago and was
!t for $1,500,000. Others are expected
3 shortly.
j Orders have been placed with a New
3 England car buliding firm for twenty
five single truck, one-man operated
cars and approximately eleven miles
of the line has been finished with exca
t vation completed for approximately
r twenty miles. Soon after January 1
>. 1921, officials of the municipal line
! say, cars will be running on two lines
g in opposite directions. The track is
laid on steel ties.
The line will run east and west and
. north and south, making transfer con
» flections where they cross. It is the
plan to eventually have the city com
-3 pletely covered by the municipal lines.
; The Detroit United Railway Com
pany at present operates its cars in
practically all parts of the city except
. thsoe where the municipal lines are
to be first built and it is not believed
attempts will be made for some time
to buld lines in territory covered by
J the D. U. R.
3 Officials of the line believe through
; the adoption of the single track, one
man type of cars will greatly facilitate
' the movement of passengers, because
of the quick get-away of the cars and
time saved in loading and unloading.
5 More cars will be operated and they
! will run so close together and often
[ that no one will have to stand on the
) corner and wait for a car and no one
) will have to stand after he boards the
car, the officials say.
l Later a double truck car will be
adopted, but the smaller type will not
be abandoned. The smaller car will
; seat 34 passengers. The twenty-five
which have been ordered will coat
$167,000, an average of $G,700 apiece.
