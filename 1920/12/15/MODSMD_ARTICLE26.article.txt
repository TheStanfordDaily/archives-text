# FRATERNITIES MAY INITIATE FRESHMEN IN WINTER QUARTER
## 
### 
Freshmen fraternity pledges who are
not on probation at the time may be
initiated into their respective fraterni
ties at the beginning of the winter
quarter, according to an announcemen
made this morning by H. A. Brown, '21
president of the Inter fraternity Confer
ence.
The decision was made at last week's
meeting of the Conference, but official
announcement awaited approval of the
measure by President Wilbur. This ap
proval has been given, with the condi
tion that the change apply to this year
only.
Under the former arrangement, fresh
men pledged in the autumn quarter
could not be initiated until the spring
quarter, provided that they had been
one quarter off probation. Freshmen
pledged in the winter quarter will be
initiated in the spring quarter as pre
viously.
No action has been taken on the sug
gestion put before the Conference that
all fraternities hold initiations at the
same time, with an object to bringing
alumni back to the campus for some
event of common interest. Any such
action is not likely, it was announced
today.
