SHANGHAI, China, Dec. 14.—Fa
mine relief work must continue for at
least ten months in China, according
to estimates made by officials who
have undertaken the distribution of
the millions that the being subscribed
to save the starving people. Forty
million lives are imperiled by the
famine.
The American Red Cross is taking
an active part In the relief work. Ma
jor Emmett C. White, chief of the in
sular and foreign division of the Amer
ican Red Cross, has gone from Manilla
to work with American Minister
Charles R. Crane in the administra
tion of the project.
Appalling tales of misery are re
ceived daily from the eight northern
provinces affected by the famine,
which is the result of a drouth. The
people have been eating leaves and
grass, heads of families have poison
ed their wives and children to save
them from starvation, children have
been sold into slavery that their par- ;
ents might live and that they them
selves would be cared for —these and ■
other similar stories of horror have
become so commonplace that they no
longer cause a flurry of excitement
here.
The rains have come to the parched
provinces and the sufferers should be
In a very much better position at the
end of ten months. «
