inability to secure houses iu Palo Alto.
Within a comparatively few years a
considerable number of the old houses
lalong Alvarado and the other rows
/will have deteriorated beyond the pos
sibility of proper repair. Likewise
within the next few years it will be
necessary to replace some ten of the
leading men of the University who will
retire 011 pension. I feel that it is
desirable to make more satisfactory
living arangements for our faculty.
We cannot expect men 011 a salary
of from three to seven thousand dol
lars to pay a large rental. I think
that we can anticipate only a payment
of from forty to seventy-five dollars
per month. We need about fifteen to
twenty new houses, value from $6,000
to $15,000, built 011 the hills above
the university buildings, perhaps with
some permanent furniture provided
which can be capitalized in such a
way that they will be rented at from
$50 to $75 per month, the balance of
the cost to be written off against the
income. If we can have proper homes
on the campus rented at a reasonable
figure, we can make our whole facul
ey more comfortable and we will also
be able to obtain the best available
men for the positions that will became
vacant and maintain an institution of
high quality."
Upon the recommendation of _the
Campus Committee, of which Mr.
Herbert Hoover is Chairman, the Trus
tees decided to proceed with the fol
lowing building scheme as rapidly as
funds are available:
ford.
A budget covering the necessities of
the University for the next ten years
has been prepared. This provides for
certain essential increases in general
expenses, for additions to the salary
roll ,for the maintenance of a pension
system, and for certain increases in
the housing facilities 011 the campus.
Upon this latter subject the follow
ing letter was addressed to the Trus
tees by President Wilbur on Novem
ber 4, lb20:
"The University at the present time
•is suffering from the emergency which
has arisen in connection with the
•housing situation upon the campus.
The subject has already been reported
to your Board and has been referred
by them to the Campus Committee for
study. The emergency is one result
of the national housing shortage. For
instance, the demands from San Fran
"cisco upon Palo Alto and the neigh
borhood have forced up rents and ab
sorbed accommodations we have
hitherto relied upon.
1. Dining and other facilities for En
ciua Hall.
2. Residence and dining halls-for 48C
men.
3.Residence and dining halls for 20j
women.
4. A $250,000 loan plan for professors'
houses.
The men's residence hall will be built
in units of 120 with "Tub-units of 30,
with a general college hall, separate
libraries, and small dining rooms. These
will be arranged in the form of quad
rangles and be located between Encina
Hall and Alvarado Row. Thfc prelim
inary pains of these buildings have been
presented to the Housing Committee
of the Alumni Interfraternity Confer
ence, and if they work out well in prac
tice they will probably become the model
for the eventual housing plan for the
fraternities when their present buildings
deteriorate.
The changes in Enciqa will include
not only dining accommodations, but
the installation of smaller library or
assembly rooms 011 the different floors.
With the erection of the new units and
with the completion of the addition to
the Stanford Union, suitable eating
facilities for every student on tlujCcam
pus will be available and thejLnimc'dj|te
pressure for student rooms wilMifrre
lieved.
The new residence hall for worne*
will probably follow the general plan ra
units—associated together—but the de
tails have yet to be worked out and will
depend alrgely upon the results obtained
with the new residence halls for men.
Reports of various sorority housing com
mittees are being carefully studied and
the final plans will be talked over witli
them.
Upon the recommendation of the Cam
pus Committee the following resolution
has been adopted by the Trustees in
regard to the additional housing facili
ties needed by the faculty:
"Resolved, That the Board of Trus
tees hereby create a fund to be known
as the Faculty Housing Fund. (1) Said
Faculty Housing Fund shall be managed
by (a) the University Comptroller, (b)
two Trustees, (3) two representatives of
the Faculty. The representatives from
the Trustees and from the Faculty to be
appointed by the President of the Board
of Trustees after consultation with tlu
President of the University. (2) The
Board of Trustees to appropriate the
amount of $250,000 to be paid when
and as required by said Committee ano
charged to Building Fund. (3) This
Faculty Housing Fund to loan to mem
bers of the Faculty 90 per cent of the
cost of new homes upon the campus
without interest, the principal to be re
paid in monthly installments over a
period of twenty years. (4) It being
the object of the Trustees to secure the
construction of permanent buildings of
substantial and attractive character, the
minimum cost and plans of such houses
shall lie approved by the Board, the in
tent being to encourage construction of
the best type. (5) An addition restric
tion to be placed upon such houses that
they may be sold only to members of
the University or rented to other than
members of the Faculty for not more
than one year, and that no guarantee
be given as to their repurchase. (6)
That said persons so designated to man
age said funds shall be known as Di
rectors of Faculty Housing Fund and
shall keep records of their proceedings
and shall submit them annually to tlie
Board of Trustees. (7) The present
plant of twenty-year ground leases with
option of four sequent renewals to be
maintained."
With freeing the builders of
new houses from the payment of interesr
charges, it is hoped to gradually bring
all of the faculty to reside on the cam
pus. Most of the present university
houses occupied by faculty members are
to be offered for sale on easy terms to
