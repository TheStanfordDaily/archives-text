In defeating the proposed plan, I do
not take it that the students would
rather see a smaller paper than a raise
iu tuition, but that they opposed the
proposition because it was not the
best possible plan.
The Daily Palo Alto must not re
duce In size and the Executive Com
mittee will use every effort possible
to see that the present status is main
tained. There are a few hundred dol
lars from last year's profits still in the
D. P. A. account and I believe that
with reasonable economy this money
will tide the paper over next quarter.
The first step in economy should be
the discontinuance of the United Press
service.
In the meantime a proper committee
will be appointed to investigate the fi
nancial conditions of the Daily and
make a printed report, coupled with a j
practical plan of financing the paper,
at a student body assembly.
A budget will be required of the :
manager covering the Winter and
Spring quarters. A financial state
ment of the last quarter will also be
submitted to the Evecutive Committee,
and with these as a basis a permanent
and practical plan will be worked out
which the students will have an op
portunity to adopt.
