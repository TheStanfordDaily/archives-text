is being made as to the best way in

continue unless there is a complete
change in the educational system of the

Notwithstanding the numbers of stu

for admission, the plan of Stanford will
bb to remain small in size and to devote
the fullest attention to those admitted, so
that it will continue to turn out thor

democratic ideas of citizenship.
