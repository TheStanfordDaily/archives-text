# SOCCER ACTIVITIES CEASE UNTIL WINTER QUARTER COMMENCES
## 
### 
Soccer's season for this quarter ended
yesterday when the freshmen played the
Palo Alto High School team and losl,
j-0. There are 110 games scheduled for
either the varsity or freshman teams
until after the New Year. A schedule
of games is being worked up, but is
not yet completed. However, the winter
quarter will undoubtedly see some
strong opponents pitted against the
teams, especially the varsity, which still
has some league contests to play oil.
The most important game will be that
with the Olympic Club on January 15.
The winning of this game will prac
tically cinch the league leadership for
Stanford, so the game will be one of the
most important of the present soccer
year.
