# JUNIOR PICTURES FOR QUAD MUST BE TAKEN NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
All sorority women who do not ex
pect to be at Stanford next quarter
must have their pictures taken for the
Quad this week, Editor Ross Fisher an
nounced today. It is imperative that
students who are not planning to re
turn be photographed at once in order
that the photographic record of the 1922
Quad be complete. Davey's Studio will
be open every day during vacation, ex
cept Christmas, for the taking of pic
tures for the Quad.

Similarly, Fisher requests that all
seniors who will graduate this quarter
or who will not re-enter Stanford in
January secure senior record blanks at
the Quad office and return them before
the end of the quarter. The Quad editoi
has a number of senior blanks which he
desires to distribute to seniors, who wiii
be aided in tin- immediate filling out of
the records for future incorpoartion in
the 1922 Quad.

The Chritsmas vacation will lie the
best time for juniors who have not been
photographed for their class pictures
to report to the photo studio, advises
Mr. Uavey, who is taking all the indi
vidual pictures for the Quad. After the
first of the year the Davey Studio wiL
be rushed with extra work, making the
photographing of juniors difficult of ar
rangement. Any junior who will be on
the campus during vacation is requested
to cooperate with the Quad management
by reporting to the studio.
