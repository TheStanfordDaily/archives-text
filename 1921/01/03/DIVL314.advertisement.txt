Greetings, Stanford!
By J. F. Haight
Sometimes 1 wonder how thoroughly Stanford men
and women of today appreciate their institution. I
wonder if they realize that every day is being- spent
amid historic scenes. 1 wonder if they know Stan
ford traditions, if they appreciate the fact that they
share in the glory of a name made famous by the ef
forts of earnest students of long- ago. I wonder if they
realize that Stanford is big enough to give them the
best and small enough to supply that which a bigger
1* institution cannot. I wonder if they ever bring out
"Stanford Stories," written by two of the old boys,
Will Irwin and Charles K. Field.
t Some of us whose lot was cast, during college days,
in places thousands of miles away, know Stanford
history and look with admiration upon this revered in
j stitution. For Stanford fame has been abroad in the
J land. Twenty years ago, as a kid, I read of the valor
| of Cardinal football, track, and crew. With others I
I mourned at the coming of the usurper, and with all
| San Francisco I rejoice now at the restoration of foot
| ball.
| This firm is in the jewelry business at Fifth and Mar
f ket, where the Peninsula busses discharge their pas
f sengers. It should be a convenient location for Stan
f ford people who buy jewelry. We try to conduct the
f business so that people will think well of us. We are
I trying to deserve a reputation for square dealing.
J We, too, wish to become an institution of honored
| traditions. Stanford's faculty, men and women stu-
T dents, will be well treated here. W r e should like to
I become acquainted.
