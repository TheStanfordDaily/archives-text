# LOCAL INFANTRY UNIT DROPPED BY WAR DEPARTMENT
## Stanford Will Concentrate On Field Artillery In Military Training; Transfer Possible 
### 
Infantry training at Stanford has
been dropped and the War Depart
ment has approved a plan to concen
trate on field artillery in military
training, in response to a request
from President Wilbur. This step
was taken because the Stanford cam
pus in extent and topography is better
adapted for field artillery training
than that of any other university in
the country, while the land grant col
leges with compulsory military train
ing giving them large numbers, are
better adapted for training in in
fantry.
Field artillery has attracted more
students than infantry at Stanford,
largely on account of the greater in
terest and variety of subjects taught
in connection with it. The men tak
ing the artillery course are given a
thorough knowledge of motors and
horses and their training deals also
in various subjects such as mathema
tics, surveying and mechanics.
Students taking infantry training
will be able to transfer to the artillery
branch without loss, according to
Major L. P. Collins, professor of mili
tary science and tactics. Those who
have begun the advanced course in in
fantry, occupying the junior and
sophomore years, will be permitted to
continue their training for infantry
officers if they prefer, although it will
be made possible for them to shift
their courses to the .artillery branch.
Lieutenant Wilson fl! Bingham, who
has been head of the infantry train
ng here, will go to the southern branch
of the University of California, which
will begin R.O.T.C. training in Janu
ary. Otherwise the present staff will
remain at Stanford.
Captain R'. C. Puckett, one of the
best veterinarians in the army has
been detailed to Stanford to give
courses in liippology. He is the author
of "The Army Horse in Accident and
Disease," which is the text book used
in the army, and was in charge of this
branch at Port Riley.
Sergeant William N. Puckett, who
is a crack pistol shot and has won
many markmanship prizes in the army
will be retained to give instruction in
rifle and pistol shooting.
