# BASKETBALL PRACTICE TO BEGIN TOMORROW
## Most of Prospects Back for Work; Coach Seay Spends Vacation in Southern Cities 
### 
Freshman basketball practice be
gins in earnest again tomorrow after
noon in the gymnasium. Coach Seay
has all his prospects back with one
or two exceptions and will start in
tensive work at once.
During the vacation Coach Seay has
been in the southern part of the state
in search of promising material and
has visited several of the large south
ern high schools meeting the new
men who are coming up. He has
found several who seem like possible
material for the season's babe quin
tet.
After this week's-practice the squad
will probably be cut again and a-final
list of twelve or fifteen will remain
to work up the freshman team. They
will practice for the present among
themselves with some practice games
with outside teams. The Palo Alto
High School has a good team this
year and will give the "Babes" some
good workouts before the first of the
conference games.
The schedule for the league games
is not out yet but Coach Seay states
that the freshmen will have some fast
teams to go up against at an early
date.
