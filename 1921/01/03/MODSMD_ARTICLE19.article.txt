# TEMPLETON MADE NEW COACH OF TRACK VARSITY
## Appointment Brings End to Long Amateur Career of Famous Four-Star Athlete 
### 
Robert L. Templeton, '18, was made
coach of the Stanford varsity track
team at the last meeting of the Board
of Athletic Control. The appointment
carries the title of "Acting Instructor
of track work at Encina Gymnasium
tor the winter and spring quarters."
Templeton is nationally known as
one of the best athletes ever produ
ced on the Pacific Coast. He is the
only "four star" man in college. Re
ports current during the vacation
period gave "Dink" credit for taking
third place in the broad jump and
thereby winning the meet. This feat
was accomplished by his brother
"Ric." "Dink" however, has another
meet/to his credit; that of 1919. In
the early stages of the contest with
California one athlete scheduled to
take an easy first place failed, and
defeat for the Cardinal seemed ine
vitable. Templeton went into the
broad jump "doped" to take not more
than a possible third place, and that
only in case of great luck. Temple
ton came through with a first place,
jumping two feet further than ever
before in his life. Later in the east
and again at Antwerp he defeated the
same star jumpers of the University
of California.
Templeton with a great fifty-yard
drop kick was largely responsible for
the world's rugby championship won
by the California eleven. His pheno
menal kicking was also the principal
factor in the Cardinal's winning of
American football games from Ore
gon and Washington, and second
place in the Coast Conference this
year.
Templeton with Captain Morris
Kirksey will have complete charge
of the track men this spring. Kirk
sey has defeated the greatest sprint
ers of the east, though Paddock of
Southern California has been able to
win from him usually by about one
inch. Roth mentors look for a suc
cessful track season.
Templeton and Kirksey are mem
bers of Encina Club.
