# WESTERN SUPREMACY

### 
Western football has come into its own with the decisive defeat
administered to the Ohio State team by the University of California
eleven at Pasadena on New Year's day. The California Varsity upheld
the honors of the West in able style, and the Berkeley institution is to
be congratulated upon producing such a team. The eleven that
played at Pasadena is the best in the West, and it demonstrated its
right to that name by smothering the Eastern team at every angle of
the game.
One of the results should be complete recognition by the East of
Western football, and consideration on the Ail-American teams. Here
tofore, honorable mention or places on the second and third teams
have .been the highest honors accorded to Western football men, but
football experts who saw the Pasadena game are of the opinion that
certain members of the California Varsity should have been consid
ered. for this year's Ail-American team. It might he that if Eastern ex
perts had looked over the Western teams a little more they might have
found a few mere candidates for Walter Camp's team.
