As this is the only way to express
one's opinion to the proper officials,
I wish to ask as a subscriber to the
D. P. A. that this be published.
Rain has been very plentiful this
fall and it is rather muddy around
the campus, especially from Encina
Hall to Encina Gym and to the Inn and
also from Encina to the Library. I
suggest that the proper authority,
after a pleasant shower, take a walk
over the before-mentioned course and
see what he thinks of the condition.
Gravel will certainly help wonderfully,
in keeping our shoes clean and dry.
This is not only an unconvenient mat
ter but a disgrace to Stanford. We,
the users of said walks would cer
tainly appreciate better walks.
