Nineteen hundred and twenty-one
years ago was the end of B. C. count
and the beginning of A. D. The
wisehelmers in the middle-ages didn't
have the foresight to see that they'd
run out of years the way they were
handling things... Imagine their con
sternation when they got down to the
year 1 B. C. and no place to go. Then
with an eye to the future they started
a progressive count that will never
wear out. A toast to 1921! Prosit!
Cheesit! Gets-it!
* * *
But it the it's going to be tough
on our progenitors someday. It'll
take three lines of type to print the
date and it'll get worse all the time.
We ought to start figuring out an
abbreviated calendar.
Anyway, this year begins with a one
and ends with another. Last year
began with a one and ended with
nothing.
Whiskey Willie says the year began
with a bun-on for him and he feels
pretty optimistic about the end of it.
Wei, yes, maybe, but then —
Pessimist Pete swears they're going
to put a roof over the IT. S. and call
it a church. Choose your pew, Pete,
choose your pew.!

Our New Year resolutions:
We don't drink any more —just the
j same amount.
We won't borrow any more money—
Nobody's got any.
We won't lose our temper again—
! haven't recovered it since the last
time.
We're through swearing—gonna go
through again.
We're gonna lay off smoking—and
try the bunk awhile.
We're gonna work hard—to get out
of it.
We're gonna petition for a raise in
tuition—yeah, raise it clear off.
We're gonna quit writin' bum jokes
j—when enough contributions come in.

We are not responsible for fire nor
i theft. Deposit your valuables in the
