# UNMACK SUGGESTS STANFORD AXE AS BIG GAME TROPHY
## Michigan "Jug" Idea Is Advocated by Pacific Coast Sports Service Writer 
### William Unmack Pacific Sports Service 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. I.—The
that ax again. It is a fetish and an in
every follower of college sports on the
Pacific Coast, but the story of the
"Michigan Jug" is not.
In 1899 Stanford produced a wood
man's ax at one of the baseball games
against California and threatened to
give it to the Blue and Gold "in the
neck." After the game, Everett Brown,
now superior judge of Alameda Coun
ty; Archie Cloud and three others stole
the Ax, and it lias since become historic,
but Stanford has never got it hack due
to the California students keeping it un
der lock and key in a hank safe-deposit
vault.
Four years later, 1903, Michigan went
to play Minnesota a football game and
took along a five-gallon stone jug filled
with Ann Arbor water. The game re
sulted in a 6-6 tie score, and in the ex
citement after the game the Minnesota
students stole the jug, and it was next
found in the trophy room at Minnesota.
It rested there until last year of A. D.
1920, when Minnesota notified Michigan
that if the latter won the jug would be
returned to its original owners, provided
an agreement were entered into that the
jug become a perpetual trophy of vic
tory between the two colleges. This
was agreed to, Michigan won this year
3-0, and now has the jug.
We know the historical value of the
Stanford Ax, and we know the high sen
timental esteem in which it is held by
California. We know that all power on
earth could not get that Ax away from
California by force, and we know that
the Stanford cohorts would like to see
that ax again. It is a feitisli and an in
stitution.
Now, why can't California take a leaf
out of the Michigan-Minnesota hook
and make a similar proposal as now ob
tains regarding the "jug."
The writer mentioned this idea to
Judge Everett Brown, as suggested by
the Pacific Sports Service, and he im
mediately coincided in the view that it
would be an exceedingly interesting fea
ture for fuure "big games" between Cal
ifornia and Stanford. He said:
"•The idea advanced by the Pacific
Sports Service at first blush appeals to
me very much. Of course 1 have not
had time to think ifcover, but I can't see
why it would not be an excellent idea
and add very much to the historic and
sentimental value of the weapon."
Many rival colleges have historic ob
jects like the ax. The jug heretofore
mentioned is one, Princeton has an old
Revolutionary cannon which once was
stolen by Rutgers college in the dead of
night, the big gun being hauled away by
means of ox teams. Princeton students
awaited their opportunity and regained
the trophy by the same means. There
are many other colleges that have sim
ilar trophies of competition.
Nothing is more dear to the college
heart than the forms of a fine opportu
nity for an interesting added ceremo
nial when the trophy is passed from one
team to another.

3-0, and now has the jug.
We know the historical value of the
Stanford Ax, and we know the high sen
timental esteem in which it is held by
California. We know that all power on
earth could not get that Ax away from
California by force, and we know that
the Stanford cohorts would like to see
that ax again. It is a feitisli and an in
stitution.
Now, why can't California take a leaf
out of the Michigan-Minnesota hook
and make a similar proposal as now ob
tains regarding the "jug."
The writer mentioned this idea to
Judge Everett Brown, as suggested by
the Pacific Sports Service, and he im
mediately coincided in the view that it
would be an exceedingly interesting fea
ture for fuure "big games" between Cal
ifornia and Stanford. He said:
"•The idea advanced by the Pacific
Sports Service at first blush appeals to
me very much. Of course 1 have not
had time to think ifcover, but I can't see
why it would not be an excellent idea
and add very much to the historic and
sentimental value of the weapon."
Many rival colleges have historic ob
jects like the ax. The jug heretofore
mentioned is one, Princeton has an old
Revolutionary cannon which once was
stolen by Rutgers college in the dead of
night, the big gun being hauled away by
means of ox teams. Princeton students
awaited their opportunity and regained
the trophy by the same means. There
are many other colleges that have sim
ilar trophies of competition.
Nothing is more dear to the college
heart than the forms of a fine opportu
nity for an interesting added ceremo
nial when the trophy is passed from one
team to another.
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. I.—The
that ax again. It is a fetish and an in
every follower of college sports on the
Pacific Coast, but the story of the
"Michigan Jug" is not.
In 1899 Stanford produced a wood
man's ax at one of the baseball games
against California and threatened to
give it to the Blue and Gold "in the
neck." After the game, Everett Brown,
now superior judge of Alameda Coun
ty; Archie Cloud and three others stole
the Ax, and it lias since become historic,
but Stanford has never got it hack due
to the California students keeping it un
der lock and key in a hank safe-deposit
vault.
Four years later, 1903, Michigan went
to play Minnesota a football game and
took along a five-gallon stone jug filled
with Ann Arbor water. The game re
sulted in a 6-6 tie score, and in the ex
citement after the game the Minnesota
students stole the jug, and it was next
found in the trophy room at Minnesota.
It rested there until last year of A. D.
1920, when Minnesota notified Michigan
that if the latter won the jug would be
returned to its original owners, provided
an agreement were entered into that the
jug become a perpetual trophy of vic
tory between the two colleges. This
was agreed to, Michigan won this year
3-0, and now has the jug.
