# WRITER SUGGESTS LIMITATION OF MEN USED IN FOOTBALL

### Franklin B. Morse Pacific Sports Service 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 3.â€”With
the remarkable growth of intersectional
and international competition in the last
few years, and the indications that these
events will continue to multiply, fol
lowers of sports in general are becom
ing more and more convinced that in
the interests of good sportsmanship and
fair play it will be necessary to enact*
some rules that will place a limit on the
number of men who may be used by a
coach.
Not only in intersectional and inter
national games does this hold true, but
it also applies to all contests. A few
examples will suffice to illustrate what
is meant.
A football team is limited to eleven
participants on the field at one time,
but there is no limit at the present time
as to the number of men a coach may in
ject into the game during its progress.
The case of the University of California
this season presents ail example of a
coach having three strings of men, or
33 players, any combination of which is
practically as good as another.
Manifestly it does not seem to be
the best of sportsmanship that this coach
should be allowed during the progress
of a game to keep putting in fresh re
serves against another team not so for
nately fixed. It would amount to noth
ing more or less than pitting one's op
ponents against three teams during the
progress of one game.
In the case of teams which travel
from one section into another to play,
considerations of finances enter in in the
number of men who can be carried with
a team. Thus a team from tiie East
who were able to bring say only 20 men
might be opposed by 33, although only
11 of them would actually be in the field
at one time.
This suggests that, in the interests of
fairness, some limit should be placed on
the number of substitutes that a coach
be permitted to use during any one con
test. The rule might call for a declara
tion on the part of a coach as to just
what 18 or 20 men of his 33 he would
use, and he would not be permitted to
go outside of the men named for that
particular contest, although for the next
game he might choose an entirely new
list.
It will be remembered that in the
annual game last fall against Stanford
University, which had few reserves to
put into the game, the University of

California kept sending in fresh men.
This was perfectly right and legitimate,
but it certainly lacked that spirit of gen
erous sportsmanship and fairness which
is so near to the heart of the American
public.
The same condition of affairs obtains
in the matter for consideration, but,
in the opinion of the writer, 25 men
seems a good figure from which to
pick a well-balanced team to enter into
the various events of say a dual meet.
There can be little question that this
plan would do much to better competi
tion as it would give the smaller insti
tutions a chance to compete on a more
even basis.
