# STANFORD'S SOCCER TEAM IS READY TO FINISH SCHEDULE
## 
### 
Winter quarter opening finds soc
cer ready to continue among the
minor sports, and with hopes of com
pleting a season which has so far been
very successful. Stanford's team is
ready to meet all comers, and if past
performances count, should clean up
on any competition which offers it
self.
The main thing on the program is
the finish of the league schedule. The
most important game to be played
next is with the Olympic Club, on
January 15. If Stanford can win this
contest, leadership of the league will
be practically cinched. Therefore all
attention is being paid to this com
ing battle, and Coach Maloney will
start to get his men in shape as soon
as possible.
The trip to British Columbia planned
for the holidays was postponed, and
will not take place until Easter vaca
tion at the close of the winter quar
ter. This is a satisfactory arrange
ment, as it gives a better opportunity
for picking the men for the all-star
combination from the Stanford and
California eeams. Also, the weather
will be better at that time, and in
terest in the game will be at its height.
The American aggregation should
prov to be tough meat for the British
ers, although of course it is to early
to make any predictions now.
