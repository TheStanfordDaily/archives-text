# VARSITY QUINTET RESUMES WORK AFTER HOLIDAYS
## Twenty-One Candidates Stay On Squad After Coach Walter Powell Makes Cut 
### 
After two weeks of rest the varsity
basketball squad will resume practice
preparatory to the first game which is
scheduled for January 10. The oppon
ent for the local five has not been
chosen although Graduate Manager
Martin has had several applications
from quintets around the bay region.
Practice started in earnest this
afternoon under Coach Walter D.
Powell. According to the number of
old players reporting for the workout,
it appears that all of the men are
ready to get right into the harness
again. Following the cut in the squad
made by Powell last quarter twenty
one men are still fighting for varsity
positions. Another cut is expected
to be made by Powell within the next
few days.
"Swede" Righter is working in the
best of shape and is counted on by
the coach as one of Stanford's strong
est players in the offensive end of the
court. Last year Righter was chosen
as a member of the All-Western quin
tet as one of the forwards. He was
captain of the Cardinal five of 1919,
as well as captain and center of his
"frosh" team.
Mills, Davies, and Richmond are the
other strong contenders for positions
for the forward end of the team, all
three being letter men from last year's
Pacific Coast Conference Champion
ship Squad. Several new men are
looking promising to the coach, sev
eral of whom will give the old timers
a run for their positions.
Adams will probably work in his old
position at standing guard, and was
accredited with honorable mention as
one of the strongest guards in the
Conference last season. The position
of running guard was left open by the
failure of the Captain-elect Butt, to
return to Stanford. This side of the
defensive end of the field during the
few weeks of practice last semester
was the scene of strong competition.
Coach Powell has several possibilities
for the running guard.
The men still in line for the varsity
squad are: Righter, Mills, Davies,
Adams, Richmond, Patrick, Neer.
Ralph Carver, L. L. Carver, Larsen,
Kraft, Fehren, Pollard, Lacey, Ander
son, Gerson, Rogers, Debenham, Neill,
Steindorf and Lindstrom.
