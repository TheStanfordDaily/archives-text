# MASQUERS WILL PRESENT CLEVER PLAY JANUARY 21
## Beatrice Edmonds, 21, and A. D. Cohan, 24, Will Lead In "Trelawny of the Wells" 
### 
"Trelawney of the Wells," written by
Sir Arthur Wing I'inero, a noted Eng
lish playwright of modern comedy, will
be produced by Masquers Society Jan
uary 21 in the Assembly Hall. The
play is one of sparkling comedy and is
different in its clever scheme of depict
ing stage life.
The cast includes eighteen members,
and they are picked from some of the

best campus talent, also including some
new dramatic enthusiasts. The part of
Rose Trelawney is taken by Beatrice
Edmunds, '21, as actress at the "Wells,"
a mid-Victorian theatre. Miss Edmunds
played in the Senior Farce last year
ajid in the Masquers play.
The comedy itself stands high among
the professional actors of this age.
Many of the most noted actors and
actresses have stared in Pinero's sen
sation. among whom were Mrs. Fiske
and Ethel Barrymore. It had a suc
cessful run in London, and when brought
to this country it packed a New York
theatre for many months. The keynote
to the play is its mid-Victorian atmo
sphere molded in a most clever and hu
morous form.
A. D. Cohan, who has never before
appeared in campus productions, will
play opposite to Miss Edmunds. His
part, that of Tom Wrench, a young play
wright who aspires to be a great actor,
but with aspirations greater than abil
ity. is clevcrly handled by Cohan.
Rehearsals for the play were started
yesterday and will be continued until the
date of the play. Gordan Davis, faculty
coach, is very enthusiastic about the
play and says that "Trelawney of the
Wells" will be Masquer's greatest suc
cess.
