# BERKELEY HOUSING CONDITIONS TO BE IMPROVED BY HALLS
## 
### 
Definite plans for the construction of
dormitories on tlie campus to relieve the
congested housing conditions in Berke
ley will be adopted by the Board of Re
gents next semester, according to an
nouncement given out by R. L. Harter,
'20, chairman of the committee on men's
dormitories.
Housing facilities in Berkeley are no- I
toriously inadequate to meet the de
mands of ten thousand students, ac
cording to Berkeley newspapers. At
tempts to encourage private capital to
build rooming houses in Berkeley have
failed to provide sufficient accommoda
tions, and the University authorities
have been forced to give their attention
to the matter.
Last spring petitions were circulated
among the students requesting the
Board of Regents to erect dormitories
on the campus, and in this way not only
provide rooms in walking distance from
classes, but reduce the rent expense.
The student committee under Harter I
has been gathering information from
colleges all over the United States in
order to aid the Regents in deciding the
type of buildings most suitable as dor
mitories.
The new buildings probably will be
erected along Strawberry Creek, and
will consist of a series of small units.
