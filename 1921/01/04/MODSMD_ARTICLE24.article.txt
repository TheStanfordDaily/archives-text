## 
### 
Many of the foremost athletic cri
tics and coaches of the country are
praising the work of Charley Erb, the
California quarterback, in the recent
game at Pasadena. Erb directed the
team throughout the Ohio contest, and
his work was well nigh perfect. Me
liad the Buckeye team baffled and
time after time crossed them np. They
were bewildered at the rapidity and
diversity of the plays use by the Blue
and Gold eleven and at the failure of
their own plays to work out tas well
as usual.
Erb, beside his skillful directing was
a strong factor in keeping up the
I*
morale of the eleven. He was every
where among the other ten men, with
a word of encouragement, or a slap
on the back that strengthened the
spirits of his team-mates in critical
moments.
Andy Smith is patting himself on
the neck because Erb will be with
the California varsity for two more
seasons.
