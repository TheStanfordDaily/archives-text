SO THERE YOU ARE
Here's to nineteen twenty-one;
What it holds for us is mystery.
But when we find out what it is,
It'll all be ancient history.

An eastern county official declares
! that marriage licenses are too cheap
Jto be dignified. Only cost half as
much as dog licenses. Hm! he's not
Staking into account the after-expenses.
A dog license pays all the expenses for
a year... A. marriage license only
! gives one the right to pay expenses
| till death do 'em part,

Come to think of it, marriage li
censes might be obtained on the
horsepower basis like motor vehicle
licenses. The strong-arm type, especi
ally constructed to run hand-laundries,
etc., would come pretty high. The
four-foot-six-I'm-little-but-tough might
correspond favorably with flivvers.
Sorta lige a basis of proportionate
merit y'know. All those in favor of
the motion as stated will gurgle,
"Rye."

Divorce-court Dan says:
"From the way divorce courts are
getting behind in the business, it
would appear plausible to have the
license manufacturers
They ought to be prosecuted under
the Pure Food Act for selling domestic
sorrow under the name of nuptial
bliss. .. Misbranded . and., artificially
colored."
* * *
They've got the system all wrong
anyway. Marriage licenses ought to
be taken out on trial like Peruna and
Gets-it. If there's no divorce within
a given length of time corresponding
to the trial time limit guarantee, the
purchaser planks down his final pay
ment and lives happily until he finds
a fly in the soup.
* * *
And then there's the installment
plan. If you dodn't pay the last in
stallment, they'd take the licence away
and that would cut out the costs In
divorce court procedure. Very handy
and saving. Big money for live wires.
Prospective agents apply to Ketchum
and Stingem, licence brokers, 111, 69th
Street.
