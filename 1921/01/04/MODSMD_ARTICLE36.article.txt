# OHIO STATE BEGAN AS "CORNFIELD COLLEGE"
## Football Team Has Brought Recognition to University 
### 
When the Ohio State University
first won the Big Ten Championship
in 1916, it was a relatively unknown
university and was widely styled as
the "babe of the Western Conference."
This expression was soon forgotten
when the new athletic contender an
nexed two more Big Ten champion
ship titles. In spite of the crushing
defeat of the Bucheye's for-famed
team at Pasadena last week by the
Pacific Coast champions there has
beai an increasing demand for infor
mation about the Ohio State institu
tion.
The Daily Palo Alto has gathered
together several bits of information
about the middle-western university.
The history of Ohio State reads like
a story of fiction. From the day it
opened its doors until the present time
the story of Ohio State is one of pro
gress.
Bepan As Cornfield College
Although it was practically the last
college to be founded in the state, in
a brief half century Ohio State Uni
versity has developed from "the col
lege in cornfield" into the country's
ninth largest university and is the
fourth largest state supported seat of
higher learning.
The university was founded on Oc
tober 13, 1870, when the location of
the college was established. At this
time Columbus was a very small town
and the university, which is now si
tuated on the north side of the city,
was then located in the country to
the north of the city. Few homes were
built north of the Union Station,
which is now in the downtown dis
trict, and the only road connecting
the university with Columbus was
the Worthington Pike.
On September 17, 1873 when the uni
versity opened its doors as the Ohio
Agricultural and Mechanical College
to a student body of seventeen mem

bers, workmen were still working on
University Hall, the only building on
the campus. Under its roof were
housed the entire personnel and the
equipment of the university.
Six Graduates in 1878
Six men comprised the first gradu
ating class which received its degrees
on June 19, 1878. By this time the
University had increased its build
ings from one to three, its student en
rollment from seventeen to 309 and
its faculty from 7 to 12.
In 1881 President Orton was suc
ceeded by Dr. Walter Q. Scott, who
remained in charge only one year.
His early resignation shook the loy
alty of the students and Ohio State
faced what was probably the most
critical period of its career. The
school was left without a powerful,
guiding hand at a time when extended
temporary stagnation meant disacter.
The crisis passed with the election
of Rev. William H. Scott, LL.D., of
Ohio University, to the presidency,
on June 21, 1883.
Always Co-Educational
Ohio State has always been a co
educational institution. In the be
ginning, no thought was given to the
enrollment of women and according
ly no provision was made for the ex
clusion from the courses of instruc
tion. Consequently when several wo
men applied for admission on the first
day the University opened, they were
accepted on Lhe same basis as men
and this rule has remained the same.
Possessing well established tradi
tions and rich in the educational work
it offers, Ohio State has not overlooked
the necessity of giving its students
a clean, wholesome social life. There
are thirty-nine Greek letter fraterni
ties among the men and ten sorori
ties among the women. In addition
there are many clubs to cement the
friendship among the students and
class honorary societies that are at
the same time a stimulant to scholar
ship and accomplishment in under
graduate affairs. The institution is
a thriving social complex where visions
may be created and where the inter
play of personalities prepared young
men and women for the social, in
tellectual and physical demands of
life.
Nearly 4000 students participated in
the various forms of competitive sport
during the last college year. At no
other institution has the importance
of properly moulding the body that
houses the mind, been given more
thought than at Ohio State University.
The reflection of this is seen in the
success of the university's major
teams which in seven years of play
among the "Big Ten" of the west
have won six championships and with
the advent of the Stadium in 1922 the
facilities for physical education will
be greatly increased.
It was all the achievements of the
past and the future of enlarged pos
sibilities that were so joyously cele
brated this Golden Anniversary, Sep
tember 13-16 of this year.

Bepan As Cornfield College
Although it was practically the last
college to be founded in the state, in
a brief half century Ohio State Uni
versity has developed from "the col
lege in cornfield" into the country's
ninth largest university and is the
fourth largest state supported seat of
higher learning.
The university was founded on Oc
tober 13, 1870, when the location of
the college was established. At this
time Columbus was a very small town
and the university, which is now si
tuated on the north side of the city,
was then located in the country to
the north of the city. Few homes were
built north of the Union Station,
which is now in the downtown dis
trict, and the only road connecting
the university with Columbus was
the Worthington Pike.
On September 17, 1873 when the uni
versity opened its doors as the Ohio
Agricultural and Mechanical College
to a student body of seventeen mem

bers, workmen were still working on
University Hall, the only building on
the campus. Under its roof were
housed the entire personnel and the
equipment of the university.
Six Graduates in 1878
Six men comprised the first gradu
ating class which received its degrees
on June 19, 1878. By this time the
University had increased its build
ings from one to three, its student en
rollment from seventeen to 309 and
its faculty from 7 to 12.
In 1881 President Orton was suc
ceeded by Dr. Walter Q. Scott, who
remained in charge only one year.
His early resignation shook the loy
alty of the students and Ohio State
faced what was probably the most
critical period of its career. The
school was left without a powerful,
guiding hand at a time when extended
temporary stagnation meant disacter.
The crisis passed with the election
of Rev. William H. Scott, LL.D., of
Ohio University, to the presidency,
on June 21, 1883.
Always Co-Educational
Ohio State has always been a co
educational institution. In the be
ginning, no thought was given to the
enrollment of women and according
ly no provision was made for the ex
clusion from the courses of instruc
tion. Consequently when several wo
men applied for admission on the first
day the University opened, they were
accepted on Lhe same basis as men
and this rule has remained the same.
Possessing well established tradi
tions and rich in the educational work
it offers, Ohio State has not overlooked
the necessity of giving its students
a clean, wholesome social life. There
are thirty-nine Greek letter fraterni
ties among the men and ten sorori
ties among the women. In addition
there are many clubs to cement the
friendship among the students and
class honorary societies that are at
the same time a stimulant to scholar
ship and accomplishment in under
graduate affairs. The institution is
a thriving social complex where visions
may be created and where the inter
play of personalities prepared young
men and women for the social, in
tellectual and physical demands of
life.
Nearly 4000 students participated in
the various forms of competitive sport
during the last college year. At no
other institution has the importance
of properly moulding the body that
houses the mind, been given more
thought than at Ohio State University.
The reflection of this is seen in the
success of the university's major
teams which in seven years of play
among the "Big Ten" of the west
have won six championships and with
the advent of the Stadium in 1922 the
facilities for physical education will
be greatly increased.
