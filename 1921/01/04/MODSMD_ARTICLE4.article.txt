## 
### 
Dr. Frederick A. Hall, chancellor of
Washington University, pwts forth a
claim that the general intelligence of
collcgc students is dropping.
"If the present growth of number is
indicative of what may he expected in
the near future the colleges will have
to watch carefully in order to prevent
turning out a lower type of graduate
than that which has characterized col
leges hitherto."
Until two years ago the proportion of
women in the universities was steadily
increasing, but with the great influx of
young men students which has followed
the war, the proportion has appreciably
decreased.
