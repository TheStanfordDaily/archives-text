# FRESHMEN COURT SQUAD TO RESUME PRACTICE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Although there has been no freshman
basketball practice for more than three
weeks, Coach Seay has not had an easy
time, for he has been touring the south
ern part of the state looking up pros
pective candidates for the babe squad.
These, with new men that have not tried
out before, will be given thorough work
outs and the best men picked for the
respective places. This will be the sec
ond and final cut in the squad and is
necessary due to the crowded condition
of the present basketball courts. The
present squad contains about twenty-five
members, and this cut will leave but fif
teen or so.
Practice for the freshmen begins to
night in Encina gym. and freshmen who
have made the squad are urged to be on
hand for the first practice, as their sea
son begins early, and Coach Seay is
anxious to get under way. He is now
specializing in team work and in build
ing up the defense.
Prospects for a fast team look bright
this year as there was an unusual wealth
of material. Most of the men have
had two to three years' experience on
some of the best prep school teams in
the country. Everywhere on the courts
could be seen the different colored
sweaters of the players representing the
more prominent athletic high schools.
These players were stars in their schools,
and it was very difficult to pick the men.
Close competition not only tends to pro
duce a better team, but it also inspires
each tryoutee to do his best.
The freshmen team, if anything can
be judged this early in the season, looks
like it would be one of the best pro
duced Th years. It will have to be,
though, as the teams that it is signed to
meet all seem to play a superior type
of basketball. Team work is the main
thing that the babes need now, and this,
with a little better basket shooting,
ought to put the frosh in the position
of one of the best freshmen fives on the
Pacific coast. Coach Seay is hopeful
and is doing everything in his power to
build up the team and make it a real
Stanford team.
