Mrs. Fox was bragging one day about the large
number of her cubs.
"How many cubs do you bring into the world at
one time?" she asked the LIONESS.
"Only ONE," replied the Lioness—"but it's a
LION."
MURADS COST 20 CENTS for a BOX
10—BUT THEY'RE MURADS!
MURADS would be lower priced if we left out
all or part of the 100% Turkish tobaccos of the pure&
and be& varieties grown —or if we substituted inferior
grades of Turkish tobacco.
But they wouldn't beMUßADS—they'donly be
Foxes!
