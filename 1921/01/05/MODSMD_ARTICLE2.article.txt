# CARDINAL SECURES EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO JORDAN'S STORY
## January Issue Contains First Installment of Life Story Of the Chancellor Emeritus 
### 
The only magazine in the country
which will publish chapters of David
Starr Jordan's autobiography in ad
vance of the printing of the life story
in book form, "The Stanford Cardinal"
will in its January issue present the
first of three installments of Dr. Jor
dan's autobiography. The New York
publisher, Casper W. Hodgson, who
will latter publish the book, was on
the campus this week and assured The
Cardinal management that full rights
will be accorded to the Stanford ma
gazine to print the selected chapters,
a privilege which has been denied
a nlumber of publications. Several
magazines of national circulation have
been negotiating with the New York
firm in an attempt to secure permis
sion to print the autobiography, but
the publisher has reached the decision
that The Cardinal will alone be authir
ized to publish extracts from the life
story of the first, president of Stan
ford.

A personal interest narrative of the
days when Stanford was first emerg
ing as an institution of national
prominence describes the initial in
stallment of the autobiography. Those
early years, shortly following the death
of Senator Stanford, formed a period
very different for the University from
the Stanford with which the present
student body is acquainted. The
human interest touch is dominant in
the January chapters for they describe
the building of Dr. Jordan's home and
the early surroundings of the Univer
sity.
The years which have followed the
death of Senator Stanford have some
what dimmed the life and chartacter
of the co-founder of the University,
and Dr. Jordan in the initial chapter
revives the personality of the West
ern railroad builder who with his wife
desired to build a "Harvard of the
West."
