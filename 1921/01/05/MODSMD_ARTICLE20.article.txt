### 
"Efforts arc being made to put a plan
into execution which will include the
recruiting of officers from ' designated
universities and colleges .to take the
places of those men who are leaving the
aviation service," Captain T. T. Craven,
Director of Naval Aviation, stated in ii
letter which was read at a meeting of
the Harvard Aeronautical Society a
short time ago. The plan is to prepare
a syllabus for use in the selected col
leges as a guide, in establishing courses
in aviation. '
At the present time plans are under
way to establish aero squadrons in con
nection with state military organiza
tions; about 15 planes and a detachment
â€¢to care for tbqin would be furnished by
the government, and about thirty fly'rs
commissioned m' the militia would be
furnished by fhe Stfrte. '-This plan is
similar to the. one that probably would
be used if the scheme for a university
unit goes through.
