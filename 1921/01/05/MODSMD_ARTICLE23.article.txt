# HOOVER AND STARVING EUROPE
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover continues to direct all of his energies toward sav
ing the lives of the starving people of Europe. Not content with the
wonderful work he did during the war and with the fame he received
as a result of that work, Mr. Hoover is now engaged in a campaign to
raise twenty-three million dollars to feed the women, children, and aged
people of Southern Europe and Poland. His campaign is producing
marked results, and from the size of the subscription list in the Literary
1 >igest, the sum required will be raised.
Hoover's relief work marks him as the greatest single friend of
humanity in the world today. He organized and directed the American
Relief Administration during the war which fed and clothed a large
portion of the people of Belgium and Austria. While others were de
stroying, Herbert Hoover was repairing, and the people of the be
friended countries all regard him as the savior of Europe. There are
very few men who are willing to devote their lives to service for others,
and the few who do are the truly great men in the world.
Hoover did not make a success of national politics because he did
nothing to further his candidacy. He was willing to accept the nomina- j
tiou if he received it, because he desired to serve the country if the;
people wanted him. He did not receive the nomination, and now he
nas given his services to the people of Europe.
Conditions <n Southern Europe and Poland are without doubt criti-'
cal, and there can be no question as to the need. Stanford people and
Si an ford organizations can aid no better cause, and there should be con- j
siderable money sent from Hoover's Alma Mater.
