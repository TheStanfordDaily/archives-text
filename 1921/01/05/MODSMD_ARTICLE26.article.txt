Ye ed. entertained.the facetious in
tention of changing the name of this
colymn to "Advanced Sparks" after
people got to putting out a few con
tributions, but the result has so dis
mayed him that he returns to the
original caption of "Cabbages and
Things." Ye chief won't lot him run.
jokes about the D. P. A., a little mat
ter that seems to be a very fruitful
source of campus humor, hence the
above and following distraught semi
editorial.
Ye "Cabbage" ed. always had con
tributions, if from no one else than
his successor. Present ed. wishes he
had a successor.
Pretty much 09 the ear today.
Sadie let 011 like she didn't know me.
Here goes.
* * *
Since "Chappie" and a lot of other
campus publications seem to be in the
habit of kicking about the 500, ye
Cabbage ed. feels that the time has
come to make reparation for the
journalistic misdeeds of others. He
doesn't approve of the way said pub
lications howl about co-eds. I should
say not! They ought to howl more.
* * *
Yes, campus journalists look at the
question too optimisticly. The Pirik
torial says lots of college women don't
marry. Says all the good ones are
picked off before they go to college.
Optimism? Betchar life! Suppose
they all did marry.
* * *
There was a co-ed once who said
that the 500 was the brains of the
institution. A later story runs that
people flocked from miles around,
wearing smoked glasses to keep from
ruining their respective eyesight as
they gazed upon the brilliant lights
of Awisdom. Before they left they
were all carrying microscopes.
* * »
This wisdom propaganda is backed
up by university records. Co-ed
scholarships rating is unsurpassed.
Lo, picture the poor prof. He hath a
class, all co-eds after a lunch. Betta
Scent, completely at sea in an ex doth
do the Nazimova. Ima Nother follows
suit. Helpless, softhearted prof,
doles out an A. Partiality won't go
so they all get top marks.
Never ask a co-ed what grades she
got. Just compliment her 011 getting
all tops. She'll tell you which ones
sho got cheated in.

doesn't approve of the way said pub
lications howl about co-eds. I should
say not! They ought to howl more.

Yes, campus journalists look at the
question too optimisticly. The Pirik
torial says lots of college women don't
marry. Says all the good ones are
picked off before they go to college.
Optimism? Betchar life! Suppose
they all did marry.

There was a co-ed once who said
that the 500 was the brains of the
institution. A later story runs that
people flocked from miles around,
wearing smoked glasses to keep from
ruining their respective eyesight as
they gazed upon the brilliant lights
of Awisdom. Before they left they
were all carrying microscopes.

This wisdom propaganda is backed
up by university records. Co-ed
scholarships rating is unsurpassed.
Lo, picture the poor prof. He hath a
class, all co-eds after a lunch. Betta
Scent, completely at sea in an ex doth
do the Nazimova. Ima Nother follows
suit. Helpless, softhearted prof,
doles out an A. Partiality won't go
so they all get top marks.
Never ask a co-ed what grades she
got. Just compliment her 011 getting
all tops. She'll tell you which ones
sho got cheated in.
