# METRIC SYSTEM IS EXPLAINED BY UTAH MINING INSTRUCTOR
## 
### 
Joseph F. Merrill, Director Schools of
Mines and Engineering, University of
Utah, spoke at the recent Standardiza
tion Conference, American Mining Con
gress, held in Denver, Colo.
Mr. Merrill, who is recognized as an
expert in promoting industrial efficiency,
appeared at the conference as delegate
of the World Metric Standardization
Council. Discussing the need for the
decimal standards, he said:
"The system of weights and meas
ures in current use in the United States
is cumbersome, complicated, and unsci
entific. It is a medley, a jumble. Its
use impedes progress, wastes hundreds
of millions of dollars annually, and
hampers the commerce of the country,
especially the world commerce.
"Why not now adopt the metric sys
tem in the United States. Some few
fear that this would mean a loss to
them. But under gradual metric stand
ardization no part of any manufacturing
plant shall be scrapped until completely
worn out. Every existing size may con
tinue indefinitely to be used, but after a
' definite date, sizes will be described in
metric language units, everywhere used,
everywhere understood.
"Simplicity results in economy: the
adoption of the simple metric system by
the United States will result in an enor
mous annual saving of time, which ex
pressed in terms of money will run into
many hundreds of millions of dollars.
Furthermore, the use of the metric sys
tem by us will extend our friendly trade
relations and be a powerful means of
promoting world progress and peace.
"Andrew Carnegie truly said, 'Our
weights and measures are a discredit to
us. We shall inevitably adopt meter
liter-gram, if for no other reason than
as an aid to peace, but they would
enormously aid our world trade.'
"Let us banish our prejudice, if we
have any, shake off our difference, over
come our inertia, and unite in taking
this forward step, so pregnant with
promise and certainty of good."
