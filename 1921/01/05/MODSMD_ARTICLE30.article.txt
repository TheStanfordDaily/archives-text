# JUNIORS MUST HURRY UP PICTURE TAKING WARNS QUAD EDITOR
## 
### 
Announcement was made today by
Editor Ross Fisher of the Quad that
only a short time remains in which
juniors may have their class pictures
taken for the 1922 yearbook. The Quad
management has so far refrained from
issuing false alarms in regard to the
taking of pictures, and Fisher now
states that the Quad will be unable to
allow much more time to the members
of the 1922 class in which to be pho
tographed for the yearbook.
Over two-thirds of the class reported
to Davey's during the autumn quarter,
the remaining 125 being given a short
period before the closing date is an
nounced.
Very few members of sororities have
been photographed, according to the re
port of the Davey Studio. As the plan
of the 1922 Quad is to pursue the cus
tomary method of taking individual pic
tures of the sorority members, a quick
response will be necessary if the en
tire membership in all the houses is
shown in the Quad.
Last week the Davey studio com
pleted the arrangements for photo
graphing of groups and organizations.
Though a few group pictures were
taken during the fall quarter, the bulk
of the work must be completed during
the coming two months. Fisher urges
that the officers of all organizations
which will have pictures in the next
Quad arrange with Davey's for the im
mediate photographing of the organiza
tions which they represent.
