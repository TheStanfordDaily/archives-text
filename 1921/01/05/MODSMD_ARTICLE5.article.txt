# INTRAMURAL FIVES ARE PLAYING AGAIN AFTER HOLIDAY HALT
## 
### 
Intramural basketball will be re
sumed as soon as the confusion inci
dent to registration is over. Director
C. S. Botsford, who is conducting the
intramural series, has announced that
he is anxious to get all the games go
ing at the earliest possible moment. He
has the entire schedule arranged on
the bulletin board at the Encina gym
nasium and will keep the teams in the
several leagues meeting until the con
tests are boiled down to the represen
tatives of each league.

Stiff competition has developed al
ready in the leagues among the individ
ual teams. The few games that came
before the holidays showed some of the
hard struggles that will develop between
the different leagues in the finals. Many
of the teams that met last year have
the same men on the team this year and
are looking forward with anticipation
to wiping out defeats or repeating vic
tories of last year. The Encina Second
Floor team that took the championship
last year has a strong quintet in the field
this year and will again make a bid for
the title. Theta Chi (El Camino)
played so consistently last season has
the same team this season and is out to
make a sweep of their league. Several
dark horses are present in the shape of
the off-campus organizations.
