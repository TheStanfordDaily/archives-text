### 
"Trelawney of the Wells," Sir Ar
thur Wing Pinero's mid-Victorian com
edy to he produced by Masquers Janu
ary 21, was a play written for theatrical
revival in England. Pinero has ar
ranged his cast so that every part calls
for a star. Even the most minor char
acter must be clever in handling his
lines.
The romantic role of the comedy is
taken by Howard Wilson, '24. Although
his part cannot he considered the lead,
he plays opposite the leading woman,
Beatrice Edmonds, as Rose Trelawney.
Wilson executed his lines of sentimen
tality naturally and cleverly.

Another feature of the comedy is the
costuming. Members of the Masquers
Society are studying the mode and forms
of dress at that age. They expect to
base the success of the play in exact
ness of costuming. A committee of the
organization will go to San Francisco
and study the dress in the public librsry

costumers in that city. The costuming
will be charming in its quaintness.
