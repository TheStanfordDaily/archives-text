# WINTER REGISTRATION REACHES HIGH MARK
## Total of 2321 Passes Number At Same Time Last Year by 137; 132 New Students 
### 
The registration in the University
has reached a higher mark than was
ever before attained at the beginning
of the winter quarter. The total num
ber registered last night was 2321,
which is to be compared with 2184
registered 011 the same day last year.
It is likely that about 100 more stu
dents will register in the next few
days, bringing the total up to or above
2400.
The total registration during the
autumn quarter of this year was 2494
which was the largest number ever
recorded. The decrease in registra
tion for the winter quarter this year
as compared with the autumn quarter
is much smaller than the average and
will apparently be well unded 100.
Last year it was about 150' and this
discrepancy was not so large as it
has been in former times. \Every
year a comparatively large proportion
of students drop out of college at the
end of the first quarter and the small
decrease this year seems to be due
to the relatively large number of stu
dents who did not drop out this year.
One hundred and thirty-two new stu
dents have entered the University
this quarter as compared with 87 last
year at this time, and 67 former stu
dents who have been out of college
for at least one quarter, have register
ed this term as compared with 78
last winter.
Of the 2321 students registered so
far this term, 1827 are men and 494
are women. There is a waiting list of
women which will promptly fill out
the quota of 500. About 90 Federal
Board students are registered in the
University.
