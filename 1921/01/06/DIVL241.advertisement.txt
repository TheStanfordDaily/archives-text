"Your old men shall dream dreams,
your young men shall see visions."
Joel 11, 28
YOUTH paints in brilliant colors.
To older, dimmer eyes the wonder
and the glory of life grey down.
In engineering, the sciences or what
ever other work you take up, you will
go far if youth means to you enthusiasm,
faith in your ambitions, the spirit that
exults in achieving what other men call
impossible.
So while you plug away at those
knotty problems in hydraulics or conic
sections, keep an open mind to the larger
issues—visions of great achievement
through great service.
To the youthful Bell, as he experi
mented in the vibrating properties of ear
drum and tubing-fork, came in fancy the
clear tones' of human speech pulsating
over wires from far away. Without the
vision he could not later have evolved
the living fact.
tYou have a like opportunity now to
think about your work in a broad way —
and the bigger your purpose and your will
to serve, the bigger your accomplishment.
