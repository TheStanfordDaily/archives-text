# VARSITY QUINTET IN READINESS FOR OPENING CONTEST
## New Players Forcing Former Stars to Limit to Hold Places on Cardinal Five 
### 
Some strange faces may be seen
when Coach Powell trots the varsity
basketball team out for Its first game
with the Olympic Club next Saturday
night. While the team is, with one
exception, intact from last year, there
are several men on the squad who
are giving the regulars lots of con
aesti for positions.
Practice is getting faster every
night. The men are getting into con
dition again following the Christmas
layoff and will all bo right for* the
coming game. The usual wdrkout
consists of one half hour of basket
shooting and a game between the first
and second varsities lasting another
half hour. Coach Powell is drilling
the forwards in several new plays that
will be ready for use in the coming
game.
Esgen who was a member.of 1919
varsity is giving Mills a tussle for the
center job. Mills seems to have the
edge because of his previous experi
ence but Esgen, although formerly a
forward, is rapidly acquiring the tech
nique of the new position and it ap
pears as if the place will not be de
finitely filled until the team lines up
on Saturday.
Adams seems to have the standing
guard position cinched. 'His great
work in this position last year makes
it exceedingly hard for anyone to
oust him, especially siyce he is doing
better this year than ever before.
Richmond is leading for the running j
guard job with Larson and Ander-1
son. The latter is a member of last
year's freshman five and is giving him
a race for the. position.
Righter and Davies have been play
ing forward during the practice games.!
Their jobs are being contested for by !
Ralph and Roy Carver and a number j
of other players of ability.
