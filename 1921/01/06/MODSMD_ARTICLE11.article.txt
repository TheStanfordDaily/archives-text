# F. L. ADAMS TO CAPTAIN 1921 BASKETBALL TEAM
## 
### 
"Freddie" Adams is captain of the
1921 basketball varsity. He was chosen
to guide the destinies of the Stanford
quintet at a meeting last night of the
five Varsity "S" men who are on the
squad and who were members of last
year's championships team.
He plays the standing guard position
and was a tower of strength to the team
throughout last season. Because of his
size and strength the defense he main
tains in that position is well nigh im
pregnable. Through his stellar work in
the past season, which, by the way, was
his first year in college basketball, he
was chosen one of the All-Coast guards.
Adams does not confine his activities
solely to this one sport. In fall lie
plays football and is rated as one of the
best ends on the coast. He was men
tioned by several sport writers for that
position on the All-Pacific Eleven of
1920. Winter he spends tossing the
basketball, and in Spring he shoves the
shot and hurls the discus in the track
and field meets.
During all other times he hauls a
transit in Civil Engineering. Adams
registers from Sacramento. He is a
member of Phi Ciamma Delta, and Skull
and Snakes.
