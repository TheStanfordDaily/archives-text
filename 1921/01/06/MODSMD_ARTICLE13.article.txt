# CHAPPIE WILL GIVE COSTUME CREEP IN THE CLUBHOUSE, FRIDAY
## 
### 
Chappie's Costume Creep will be well
attended if thv present sale of tickets
keeps up, in fact enough are sold al
ready to make it a very successful affair,
according to the "dope" given out today.
The Creep will take place tomorrow
evening at the Women's Clubhouse with
music by Whitmer's orchestra, and is
unique in the fact that strict economy
in the purchasing or making of costumes
is insisted upon by those in charge. It
is stated that one does not need an
elaborately foolish costume to be ad
mittedâ€”a degree of foolishness can be
obtained easily enough at a cost
twenty-five cents, despite the fact that
nothing else can.
Examples of art work by Chappie's
artists will be given as prizes for the
best costumes. These copies of old
masters will of course, be in a humorous
vein, and should furnish many a laugh
to the recipients.
