riv; 1 the triumvirate of Yah:, Princeton
and Harvard in the oast.
This new agreement will not affect the
relations of any of the universities in
volved with the other universities in
the Pacific -Coast 'Conference. Instead
of being governed -strictly by schedule
drawn up by fhat organization the mcm
bers are now free to arrange games as
they see fit, and to their best advantage
financially. The rules of the Pacific
Coast Conference-ill regard to eligibility
and policy of conduct of athletic con

the members of the new Big Three.
According fo the new play, the first
three weeks in November 'of each year
will be reservt dates for games be
tween Washington, California, and
Stanford. The first week either Cali

Stanford.
Graduate Manager Edward R. Mar.tin
and Coach Walter Powell have expressed
themselves as being well satisfied with
the arrangement. Martin regards the
agreement as the most logical one to re
place the proposed schedule of the Pa
cific Coast Conference. He believes
that relations between conference mem
bers will be strengthened because it will
take the arrangement of games from a
single body and place them where they
can be handled better, that is, with the
officials of the contesting universities.
The first meeting of the Big Three at
which the schedule for the coming sea
son was arranged was attended by E. R.
Martin, graduate manager, and Walter
Powell, head coach at Stanford; Pro
fessor R. W. Cortelyou, assistant grad
uate manager at California, and Pro
fessor L. J. Aver of the faculty of the
University of Washington.
Representatives of the University of California, University of Washington,
and Stanford met at the PaftcV Hotel yesterday and arrant;ed\m agreement
governing football relations between the three colleges. This action was taken
following the abandoning of the Pacific Coast Conference football schedule

universities asked to be relieved from the schedule as published at that time.
California, Washington and Stanford because of their positions in Western
athletics and because of tlx Tivalry between them have foimed an rirgrcement
to play each other each year. There is a great public interest in the games
played by the three universitier. and this will be increased following'the comple-

Ition of stadiums at Stanford and Cali-
I fornia. Thus the Pacific Coast will
, have a Big Three organization that v/ill
riv; 1 the triumvirate of Yah:, Princeton
and Harvard in the oast.
This new agreement will not affect the
relations of any of the universities in
volved with the other universities in
the Pacific -Coast 'Conference. Instead
of being governed -strictly by schedule
drawn up by fhat organization the mcm
bers are now free to arrange games as
they see fit, and to their best advantage
financially. The rules of the Pacific
Coast Conference-ill regard to eligibility
and policy of conduct of athletic con
tests will govern the games played by
the members of the new Big Three.
According fo the new play, the first
three weeks in November 'of each year
will be reservt dates for games be
tween Washington, California, and
Stanford. The first week either Cali
fornia or Stanford will invade Seattle
to meet the Washington eleven. The
following week the University of Wash

lowing week, the third in November,
California and Stanford will play •then

October in each year will be devoted
to the usual preparatory games wi:h
small colleges, clubs, the army and navy
elevens, and one or two games will be

have a game during October with the
Oregon Aggies and possibly Washington
State or the University of Oregon.
The custom of both California and

California teams while the other will

ization or min< r college on that date.
Post season games will also be in

for the universities of the western slope
to finish the football season by Thanks
giving Day. Next year it is planned to
bring to the coast for a game
with Washington, while Stanford and
California may engage in one or more
j gartVs in excess of the usual schedule.
