# DOPE ON SOCCER SEEMS TO PREDICT STANFORD VICTOR!
## Plans For Definite Schedule Hang on Return of Maloney From British Columbia 
### 
Definite soccer plans have not yet
been decided on. and no now develop
ments have shown themselves within
the last two flays. Motet oi the ac
tivity is waiting upon Coach Ma
loney's return from British Columbia.
In the meantime, the squad i; mark
ing time and awaiting the bailee to
get into organized practice out - more.
No practices have been held as yet,
so it is impossible to say how the
team shapes up after the rest over
Christmas vacation. However, there
is no reason for supposing Unit any
great change has taken place, and
unless something unforeseen develops,
soccer this quarter should prove to be
as much of a triumph for the Cardinal
as it was last quarter. Captain New
lands and his men, however are anxi
ous to get down to business jus soon
as possible to prepare for the coming
contests.
The most important gsme in the
offing is the one against the Olympics
on January 15. This will be a crucial
league game. So far, Stanford has
held the leadership of the league with
out meeting a single defeat, bat'if the
clubmen succeed in winning. Ut*\y will
become dangerous contenders lov first,
place. The coming game was 1o have
been played before vacation last quar
ter, but was postponed on account of
rain. It. is an interesting subject of
speculation whether the Cardinal
team or the Olympics have lost more
by the rest and resulting luck of
training over the holidays.
On the basis of past performance,
chances for a victory look decidedly
good. One factor that makes the
whole proposition uncertain, however,
is the marked improvement made by
the Olympics since they last played
Stanford. There is no denying that
they have strengthened tbeii team
considerably in the last month or so,
and the new (elements oi strength
must be reckoned with when trying
to line up the proper dope for pro
phecy. On the other hand, Coach Ma
loney has been making shifts and
changes which have added to the ef
fectiveness of the Cardinal soccer
machine, and tho added power gained
from this should be enough to offset,
any increase on the other side How
ever the situation finally shapes out,
it is apparent that Stanford has an
excellent soccer team, and one which,
according to dope, should find a rest
ing place on the top of the heap.
