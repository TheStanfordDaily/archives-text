# THE 						FATE OF THE CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Athlctic authorities at Stanford, California, and Washington, in
forming' the "Liigl Three," have stated that this act does not mean the
dissolution of the. Pacific Coast Conference. They are of the opinion
â™¦hat (he Conference will be kept alive by its powers to decide questions
of."eligibility and set policies. They believe that the members of the
Conference can schedule their own football games and baseball games
much better on their own initiative, and that the Conference can
survive without exercising this function.
However, it would seem that with the formation of the "Big
Three" the existence, of the Conference stands in jeopardy. Stanford,
California, and Washington are placing themselves in an independent
position, and at.Uie first sign of disagreement over eligibility or a ques
tion of policy, they will be in a position to withdraw. The University
of. Oregon and Washington State College have already opposed the
four-game ruling, and are at outs with the Conference officials. From
all indications, it will take only a slight argument to throw the Con
ference organization to the winds.
The Pacific. Coast Conference has done much to place athletics
on; the Pacific Coast on a high plane, and it the organization is done
away with the usual athletic war would probably ensue to the inevit
able disgust of the public The future of Coast athletics appears to be
linked ufewith the. ITfe of the Conference.
A logical solution has been proposed by the athletic director at
Whitman College, and which was also suggested by The Daily Palo
Alfo a short timd ago. Hie idea is to divide all of the Pacific Coast in
stitutions into major and minor groups with respect to their geographic
locations. Winners of the different groups would play for the Con
ference title in all sports, and all schedules and rules would be made
by the central organization. This would allow the University of
Southern California, atid the smaller colleges such as Santa Clara, St.
Mary's, Whitman, Willamette, and others to come under the supervi
sion of the Conference, and play for the title. There would be no out
law colleges paying athletes, as is the case now, and the general stand
ard of college athletics' would be raised.
Such an arrangement would not interfere with California, Stan
ford, and Washington meeting each other, and seems to be a good
solution of the difficulty.
