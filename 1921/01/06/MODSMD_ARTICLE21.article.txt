# FAIRCLOUGH RECEIVES UNUSUAL WAR HONORS
## 
### 
Many tributes liave been accorded to
Ymericans engaged in relief work in
Europe but none have been more unique
or appreciative than the declaration last
year by the kingdom of Montenegro of
the fourth of July as an official holiday
of that small Balkan country. The ex
planation of the unusual course of Mont
enegro in adopting the national birthday
of another country as a holiday for its
own citizens to celebrate is not diffi
cult. In 110 European country during
the past few years has the condition
calling for relief been more acute and
in no country has the relief been more
effective in lessening the pressure upon
the desperate than in Montenegro
where for eighteen months Henry Rush
ton Fairclough directed the work of the
American Red Cross.
Returning to Stanford four months
ago, Professor Fairclough was one of
the last of that band of Stanford faculty
who offered their services to the nation
during the war to give up the work
as-signed him. A period of ten months
service in Switzerland preceded his bet
ter known work in the Balkans. Arriv
ing in Switzerland in June, 1918, he was
made chairman of the commission in
charge of all American and Belgium re
lief in that country, serving until April
of the following year.
The broad outlines of Professor Fair
clough's work in Montenegro are well
known to his Stanford friends who fol
lowed with interest the reports brought
to the campus of what was recently re
ferred to "as the most impressive piece
of relief work ir Europe." Medical re
lief, chihl welfare and child feeding
summarize the duties of the Red Cross
staff of fifty members which he directed
as Lieutenant-Colonel. Four hospitals
end two orphanages were established
which have since been made permanent
institutions bv the government. Fifty
public kitchens-were erected throughout
the country to fully care for the war
stricken children.
The mere recital of the decorations be
stowed upon Dr. Fairclough reveals the
measure of appreciation for his work.
"Officier de 1' Ordre de la Couronne"
was accorded him by the King of Bel

gium. The Crown Prince of Serbia
advanced him to "Commander of the
Order of St. Sava," being the only
American who has ever received the
title. The Order of EX Danilo was
recently conferred upon him by the
Montenegrian king as well as the Serb
ian Red Cross and the Order of the
White Eagle by the Serbian govern
ment.
Born in Ontario, Canada, in 1862, he
completed his secondary and collegiate
education in Canadian schools, graduat
ing from the University of Toronto in
1883. The degree of Ph D was accord
ed him by John Hopkins University in
1896.
Six years of teaching at the Univers
ity of Toronto preceded his Appointment
as an Associate Professor of Greek and
Latin at Stanford in 1893. Though not
one of the "original iiftee," Professor
Fairclough has been so intimately asso
ciated with Stanford for the last twenty
seven years that he is known as one of
the "Old Guard." Holding different
professorial chairs during the time he
has been at the University, he is now
directing head of the Department of
Latin.
As an author and editor, Professor
Fairclough's texts are accepted through
out the country as standard works. His
two most important books arc probably
"The Connection Between Music and
Poetry in Early Greek Literature" and
"The Attitude of Greek Tragedians To
wards Nature." The presentation of the
Antigone of Sophodes under his direc
tion by members of the faculty and the
student body in 1902 was a unique dram
atic attempt, the success of which led
to the publication of a book based upon
the acting of the play at Stanford.
A member and past president of the
Pacific Philological Association, Dr.
Fairclough maintains an active interest
in a number of organizations dealing
with classical study. He is Vice-Pres
ident of the Archilogical Institute of
America and a member of the Hellenic
Society of Great Britain and the Authors
Club of London. Alpha Delta Phi
claims him as one of its most prominent
members.
