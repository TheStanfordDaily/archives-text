Helpless Harry tells us that a cow
got canned up the other day from
eating bran mash direct from the
hootch shop. Says the old bovine
wazer right merry and rooted up the
flower beds trying to pick out a suit
able buttonhole boquet. A neighbor
saw the tip of her farflung tail stick
ing above the top of the surround
ing high board fence, and ran home
and hid under the bed. He thought
he saw a cornfield tasseling out but
he couldn't account for its rapid ac
tion.

Surreptious Sam smiles Berenely
and opines that he'd like to have some
of that cow's milk. He thinks a milk
factory with a kick like that oucht
to furnish an approachable brand of
lacteal fluid... That's all right too, but
who's goin' to do the milkin'?

"Safety First" is bein' ruined by the
reformers. The old slogan was all to
the gravy 'til the modern exponent
of reformation hooked his paw on it.
We expect to see "Safety First" signs
hanging over the sidewalks pretty
soon to serve as a warning to speed
mad pedestrians.

Amiable Art declares that's why
they insist on handin' you dull steak
knives in restaurants. They ought to
go a step further and try to keep the
tables a safe distance apart. A little
elbow is a dangerous thing.

But why stop there? If the world
is to be made safe for eccentricity,
only two people ought to be allowed
to eat soup or spaghetti at once.
More crowds than one have rallied to
what sounded like a fire whistle, but
they usually trace it down to Tony's
vermicilli parlor. The hotter the
hotter tho soup, the shriller the
whistle.

Lowly Lowell remarks that there
are three kinds of links; golf, cuff
and missing... We suppose he means
the cuff at the ball and miss it... And
at that a good many hours have been
wasted by the patient hobby looking
for either a missing link or a collar
button.

Jack Spratt could eat no fat,
' His wife could cat no lean.
And so they saved the butcher bill
And lived on pork and beans.
