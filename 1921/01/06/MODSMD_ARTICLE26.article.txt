# FRESHMAN CLASS TO GIVE FIRST DANCE OF YEAR ON JANUARY 15
## 
### 
The class of '24 will give its first
dance of the year on January 15.
Plans have been worked out by a
committee appointed for that pur
pose. It is expected that this first
social affair of the freshman class
will prove to be something well worth
while, if present plans work out as
intended.
The dance will not be in the nature
of a jolly-up. It will be held at En
cina instead of in the Women's Club
House as was originally announced.
Tickets will be put on sale next week
at the Administrative building and
only 150 will be available. Good mu
sic will be furnished and an attrac
tive scheme of decoration is being
worked out.
