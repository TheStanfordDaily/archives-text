# Many Sorority Women Allowed to Leave Hall
## 
### 
On account of the crowded condi
tions of the living quarters, some
freshmen women, as well as all juniors
and seniors who had been in residence
at Roble Hall for one quarter were al
lowed to go to their houses at the be
ginning of this quarter. Although
this is contrary to the established
policy of the University which at
tempts to insure a wider field of ac
quaintance among the women stu
dents by requiring one year of resi
dence at the dormitory before sorori
ty women are allowed to live in their
houses, unusual conditions arising
from the number of new women re
gistered this quarter and last have
made it lfecessary to make some ex
ceptions.
