# BASKETBALL FEES TO BE PAID SOON
## Extra Dollar Voted in Last Quarter Will Be Collected With Winter Syllabus Fees 
### 
The one dollar assessment which
will be used to help gnance the pro
posed basketball pavilion will be col
lected with the syllabus charge this
| quarter, the Registrar's office an
nounced today. The reason that it
was not included in the tuition fees
collected the first, day was that the
registration books were printed for
the winter kuarter too early for this
charge to be incorporated.
The fee, which will be collected
for the next four years, will probably
be included in the tuition later. Syl
labus fees will be sent out during the
first part of February.
The students voted in November to
add one dollar to the registration
each quarter in order to repay a loan
from Board of Trustees for the con
struction of the pavilion, which will
cost $75,000. At the time, President
Wilbur and Comptroller Roth each
agreed to cut down their budgets
$2,500 apaice, the money thus saved
to be used for the new building.
The pavilion as planned will be
connected with the present gymnasi
um so that the same showers and
appurtenances may be used. The
main floor may also be used for
dances.
The reason for planning the new
pavilion were the fact that the present
court is built upon a cement founda
tion which works hardship on the ath
letes and that the building now used
is not large enough to accommopate
the crowds that attend basketball
games.
