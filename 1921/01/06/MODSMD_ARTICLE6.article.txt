# JORDAN'S COURTESY MAKES PRINTING OF LIFE STORY POSSIBLE
## 
### 
Only through the courtesy of David
Starr Jordan and Casper W. Hodgson,
the New York publisher, will the Stan
ford Cardinal be enabled to publish
selected chapters from the autobiography
of Stanford's first president. Though
attempts have been made by several
magazines to secure exclusive rights for
the publication of the autobiography, Dr.
Jordan and his publisher decided to re
fuse the requests.
Tlie Cardinal, by reason of its campus
circulation and its position as the liter
ary magazine of Stanford was accorded
an unusual courtesy when permission
was given it to print several chapters
prior to the publication of the life story
in book form.
