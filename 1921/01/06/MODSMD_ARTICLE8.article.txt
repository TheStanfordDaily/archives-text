# ASSEMBLY HEARS FAMOUS RUSSIAN ON BOLSHEVISM
## Noted Author's Son Describes Conditions in Russia to Record Breaking Crowd 
### S. N. Pierce, '22 
A picture of the complete breakdown
of the social and economic life of a
nation, where the cities are being
abandoned and the people returning
to the primitive life of an earlier time,
was painted by Count Ilya Tolstoy,
son ot the famous Russian philosopher
and writer, Leo Tolstoy, at this morn
ing's assembly in his address, "The
Truth About Russia."
The people living in the big cities,
are starving, he said. In Petrograd
112 oui of every thousand of the po
pulation are dying every year. The
people spend their time hunting for
food, he declared. Though profiteer
ing is prohibited by the Bolsheviki,
food is sold at exhorbitant prices.
Transportation has also broken
down. Where formerly there were
twenty trains a day between Moscow
and Petrograd now there is one a
week, count Tolstoi said.
The industrial workers are going
back to the villages from whence they
in which the people lived a hundred
came returning to the primitive state
years ago. C!ount Tolstoy asserted
that grass was growing in the streets
of Petrograd.
"The communism which the Bolshe
vists wanted to bring about in Russia
does not exist and they themselves
understand it. They have accomp
lished the first part of their program,
which was to destrop capitalism. In
place of the capitalists they have
| built up a new class of bourgoise;
i those who have robbed the old bour
goise have become the new bour
goise.
"The only hope of the Bolsheviki
is to spread their doctrines all over
the world. They are attempting to do
this by books and by teaching. In
Moscow 500 liindu boys are studying
' and when they are finished they will
be sent back to their native land to
spread the doctrines they have learn
ed." Count Tolstoy declared that the
Bolshevists made two mistakes in try
ing to bring about their ideal of com
munism. The first, he said, was in
the methods which they employed, and
it is only in thjs that they differed
from the Mensheviks, their opponents,
; because they advocated bringing it
! about by violence. The speaker said
I that communism can only be intro
duced where it is desired by all the
people of a state.
Their second mistake, he asserted,
was in giving the power to the lowest
elements of the country, the industrial
class and the soldiers.
"You cannot compare the Russian
worker with the laborer in the United
States. Here, the labor class is edu
cated and the worker has a family
and a home life, while in Russia the
worker is ignorant and works for
fifty cents a day. Neither his he any
home life since he left his family in
the village from which he migrated j
to the city. The soldier has lost the j
good qualities of the peasant.
"It was to these people that the
power was given by the Bolsheviki. |
They aroused the lowest instincts —,
greed, class hatred, and envy. The.
motto of the Bolsheviki is "rob the,
robbers.' They threw themselves 011
the wealth of the country. They seiz-j
ed the factories and raised their own 1
wages to several thousand dollars a
day in Russian money, at the same
time shortened the hours of work to
ten of fifteen minutes (a day, the |
dream of the American I. W. W.
"The result was that production i
dropped from eight to thirty per cent, j
Only twenty per cent of the factories
are operated."
Count Tolstoi related the condition;
under which the Russians fought dur-j
ing the early part of the war and,
said if these were known Russia's j
withdrawal from the conflict would 1
not be blamed.
"Russia lost more men in the first j
two years of the war than all the rest j
of the Allies did in five years. On J
one occasion General Kuropatkin. who j
was in charge of the Russian forces j
told the Czar if a certain attack was
made it would mean the sacrifice of
45,000 men. The Czar ordered the at- J
tack and the result was that 50.000 j
Russians were killed in one day. The j
Russians treated their soldiers worse j
than cattle."
It was the treatment of the Russian
soldier coupled with the slavery of 1
the population at home which caused !
the Russion revolution, according to j
the speaker.
He said that the soviets, which were :
set up immediately on the outbreak,
of the revolution gradually undermin-1
ed the power of the provisional gov- j
ernment, until the Bolsheviki were j
able to seize it.
Kerensky, who was the second head
of the provisional government, was
characterized by Count Tolstoy as a j
man who "had neither the power of
will nor the brains to rule."
Speaking of his father Count Tol
stoy said:
"Leo Tolstoy was a real christian
though not believing in interpretations
through sects or religions. His doc
trine was based on love and the re
pudiation of violence.
"According to his doctrine was is
a crime because it is based on vio
lence. The Russian Revolution was
accomplished by violence, therefore
110 good results can come from it.
Bolshevism is wrong because it rests
011 violence. His way to combat Bol
shevism would be not to use any
violence against them."
Count Tolstoi said the way to help
the Russian people was to leave them
alone. He described Bolshevism as a
disease which Russia could absorb
when it gets strong enough.
The speaker expressed the belief
that the Bolsheviki would be over
thrown in the near future and that
a republican form of government
would be set up in Russia.
In closing. Count Tolstoy said that
world peace rested, not on a League
of Notions, because, he asserted that
is supported by vio-lence, but by a
united states of the world.

and Petrograd now there is one a
week, count Tolstoi said.
The industrial workers are going
back to the villages from whence they
in which the people lived a hundred
came returning to the primitive state
years ago. C!ount Tolstoy asserted
that grass was growing in the streets
of Petrograd.
"The communism which the Bolshe
vists wanted to bring about in Russia
does not exist and they themselves
understand it. They have accomp
lished the first part of their program,
which was to destrop capitalism. In
place of the capitalists they have
| built up a new class of bourgoise;
i those who have robbed the old bour
goise have become the new bour
goise.
"The only hope of the Bolsheviki
is to spread their doctrines all over
the world. They are attempting to do
this by books and by teaching. In
Moscow 500 liindu boys are studying
' and when they are finished they will
be sent back to their native land to
spread the doctrines they have learn
ed." Count Tolstoy declared that the
Bolshevists made two mistakes in try
ing to bring about their ideal of com
munism. The first, he said, was in
the methods which they employed, and
it is only in thjs that they differed
from the Mensheviks, their opponents,
; because they advocated bringing it
! about by violence. The speaker said
I that communism can only be intro
duced where it is desired by all the
people of a state.
Their second mistake, he asserted,
was in giving the power to the lowest
elements of the country, the industrial
class and the soldiers.
"You cannot compare the Russian
worker with the laborer in the United
States. Here, the labor class is edu
cated and the worker has a family
and a home life, while in Russia the
worker is ignorant and works for
fifty cents a day. Neither his he any
home life since he left his family in
the village from which he migrated j
to the city. The soldier has lost the j
good qualities of the peasant.
"It was to these people that the
power was given by the Bolsheviki. |
They aroused the lowest instincts —,
greed, class hatred, and envy. The.
motto of the Bolsheviki is "rob the,
robbers.' They threw themselves 011
the wealth of the country. They seiz-j
ed the factories and raised their own 1
wages to several thousand dollars a
day in Russian money, at the same
time shortened the hours of work to
ten of fifteen minutes (a day, the |
dream of the American I. W. W.
"The result was that production i
dropped from eight to thirty per cent, j
Only twenty per cent of the factories
are operated."
Count Tolstoi related the condition;
under which the Russians fought dur-j
ing the early part of the war and,
said if these were known Russia's j
withdrawal from the conflict would 1
not be blamed.
"Russia lost more men in the first j
two years of the war than all the rest j
of the Allies did in five years. On J
one occasion General Kuropatkin. who j
was in charge of the Russian forces j
told the Czar if a certain attack was
made it would mean the sacrifice of
45,000 men. The Czar ordered the at- J
tack and the result was that 50.000 j
Russians were killed in one day. The j
Russians treated their soldiers worse j
than cattle."
It was the treatment of the Russian
soldier coupled with the slavery of 1
the population at home which caused !
the Russion revolution, according to j
the speaker.
He said that the soviets, which were :
set up immediately on the outbreak,
of the revolution gradually undermin-1
ed the power of the provisional gov- j
ernment, until the Bolsheviki were j
able to seize it.
Kerensky, who was the second head
of the provisional government, was
characterized by Count Tolstoy as a j
man who "had neither the power of
will nor the brains to rule."
Speaking of his father Count Tol
stoy said:
"Leo Tolstoy was a real christian
though not believing in interpretations
through sects or religions. His doc
trine was based on love and the re
pudiation of violence.
"According to his doctrine was is
a crime because it is based on vio

accomplished by violence, therefore
110 good results can come from it.
Bolshevism is wrong because it rests
011 violence. His way to combat Bol

violence against them."
Count Tolstoi said the way to help
the Russian people was to leave them
alone. He described Bolshevism as a
disease which Russia could absorb
when it gets strong enough.
The speaker expressed the belief
that the Bolsheviki would be over
thrown in the near future and that
a republican form of government
would be set up in Russia.
In closing. Count Tolstoy said that
world peace rested, not on a League
of Notions, because, he asserted that
is supported by vio-lence, but by a
united states of the world.

' and when they are finished they will
be sent back to their native land to
spread the doctrines they have learn
ed." Count Tolstoy declared that the
Bolshevists made two mistakes in try
ing to bring about their ideal of com
munism. The first, he said, was in
the methods which they employed, and
it is only in thjs that they differed
from the Mensheviks, their opponents,
; because they advocated bringing it
! about by violence. The speaker said
I that communism can only be intro
duced where it is desired by all the
people of a state.
Their second mistake, he asserted,
was in giving the power to the lowest
elements of the country, the industrial
class and the soldiers.
"You cannot compare the Russian
worker with the laborer in the United
States. Here, the labor class is edu
cated and the worker has a family
and a home life, while in Russia the
worker is ignorant and works for
fifty cents a day. Neither his he any
home life since he left his family in
the village from which he migrated j
to the city. The soldier has lost the j
good qualities of the peasant.
"It was to these people that the
power was given by the Bolsheviki. |
They aroused the lowest instincts —,
greed, class hatred, and envy. The.
motto of the Bolsheviki is "rob the,
robbers.' They threw themselves 011
the wealth of the country. They seiz-j
ed the factories and raised their own 1
wages to several thousand dollars a
day in Russian money, at the same
time shortened the hours of work to
ten of fifteen minutes (a day, the |
dream of the American I. W. W.
"The result was that production i
dropped from eight to thirty per cent, j
Only twenty per cent of the factories
are operated."
Count Tolstoi related the condition;
under which the Russians fought dur-j
ing the early part of the war and,
said if these were known Russia's j
withdrawal from the conflict would 1
not be blamed.
"Russia lost more men in the first j
two years of the war than all the rest j
of the Allies did in five years. On J
one occasion General Kuropatkin. who j
was in charge of the Russian forces j
told the Czar if a certain attack was
made it would mean the sacrifice of
45,000 men. The Czar ordered the at- J
tack and the result was that 50.000 j
Russians were killed in one day. The j
Russians treated their soldiers worse j
than cattle."
It was the treatment of the Russian
soldier coupled with the slavery of 1
the population at home which caused !
the Russion revolution, according to j
the speaker.
He said that the soviets, which were :
set up immediately on the outbreak,
of the revolution gradually undermin-1
ed the power of the provisional gov- j
ernment, until the Bolsheviki were j
able to seize it.
Kerensky, who was the second head
of the provisional government, was
characterized by Count Tolstoy as a j
man who "had neither the power of
will nor the brains to rule."
Speaking of his father Count Tol
stoy said:
"Leo Tolstoy was a real christian
though not believing in interpretations
through sects or religions. His doc
trine was based on love and the re
pudiation of violence.
"According to his doctrine was is
a crime because it is based on vio
lence. The Russian Revolution was
accomplished by violence, therefore
110 good results can come from it.
Bolshevism is wrong because it rests
011 violence. His way to combat Bol
shevism would be not to use any
violence against them."
Count Tolstoi said the way to help
the Russian people was to leave them
alone. He described Bolshevism as a
disease which Russia could absorb
when it gets strong enough.
The speaker expressed the belief
that the Bolsheviki would be over
thrown in the near future and that
a republican form of government
would be set up in Russia.
In closing. Count Tolstoy said that
world peace rested, not on a League
of Notions, because, he asserted that
is supported by vio-lence, but by a
united states of the world.

A picture of the complete breakdown
of the social and economic life of a
nation, where the cities are being
abandoned and the people returning
to the primitive life of an earlier time,
was painted by Count Ilya Tolstoy,
son ot the famous Russian philosopher
and writer, Leo Tolstoy, at this morn
ing's assembly in his address, "The
Truth About Russia."
The people living in the big cities,
are starving, he said. In Petrograd
112 oui of every thousand of the po
pulation are dying every year. The
people spend their time hunting for
food, he declared. Though profiteer
ing is prohibited by the Bolsheviki,
food is sold at exhorbitant prices.
Transportation has also broken
down. Where formerly there were
twenty trains a day between Moscow
and Petrograd now there is one a
week, count Tolstoi said.
The industrial workers are going
back to the villages from whence they
in which the people lived a hundred
came returning to the primitive state
years ago. C!ount Tolstoy asserted
that grass was growing in the streets
of Petrograd.
"The communism which the Bolshe
vists wanted to bring about in Russia
does not exist and they themselves
understand it. They have accomp
lished the first part of their program,
which was to destrop capitalism. In
place of the capitalists they have
| built up a new class of bourgoise;
i those who have robbed the old bour
goise have become the new bour
goise.
"The only hope of the Bolsheviki
is to spread their doctrines all over
the world. They are attempting to do
this by books and by teaching. In
Moscow 500 liindu boys are studying
' and when they are finished they will
be sent back to their native land to
