# FAMOUS LIBRARY IS GIVEN TO STANFORD
## Professor Milnikov Presents One of Finest Collection On Slav Race to University 
### 
Professor Paul Miliukov, tlie disting
uished Russian historian and Secretary
of Foreign Affairs in tlie Russian gov
ernment after the revolution of 1917,
has presented the Stanford University
I.is entire private library, one of the fin
est apd most complete collections on
Russian history in existence. This lib
rary, packed in thirty-four cases, was
shipped December' 2, from Helsingfors,
where it had been in storage for six
years, Professor Miliukov having sent
it out of Russia and hidden it in Fin
land in 1914 at the outbreak of the war.
The acquisition o fthis notable gift is
a by-product of the gathering of the
Hoover War Collection, although Mil
iukov has presented his library to the
Stanford Library and it will not be a
part of the collection of books and docu
ments relating to the Great War which
i> being gotten together at Stanford.
Piofessor Frank A. Colder, who is now
in Europe gathering material for the
Hoover War Collection, met Dr. Miliu
kov in London last September. He had
known Miliukov before and during the
war, and the Russiain historian at this
London meeting proposed that he would
like to present his library to Stanford
University. He had not seen it since
1914, when he stored it with a German
farmer in Helingfors, and was fearful
lest it would be altogether lost.
As a matter of fact when Professor
Colder, with some difficulty and only
with the aid qf the Finnish Foreign
: Secretary Holtsi, got into touch with
: this farmer, he found that the farmer,
eager to get his storage charges was
! considering accepting offers to purchase
it.
Miliukov is one of Russia's most dis
tinguished historians and was Professor
of history at the University of Moscow.
Ht was a political leader of the liberal
j "cadet group" of constitutional demo
crats in the Duma. In the revolution of
! 1917 he became Secretary of Foreign
Affairs but was forced to resign in May
1 1917, because of his effort to hold Rus
sia faithful to the allies. He was forced
jto flee from Russia when the Bolshe
viki siezed the power and has been a
| fugitive from Russia since that time.
Of the Miliukov library Professor
I Colder writes:
"From all accounts it is an unusual
I collection 011 Russia history and 1 may
say with certainty that Stanford will
have the best Russian history collection
oust of the Atlantic coast. This collec
tion is a beginning and in time I trust
that we may have one of the few great
collections in the country. You have
r. l idea how scarce Russia boyks have
become. The Bolos have nationalized
all book stores so that it is practically
impossible to buy anything in the open
market. The war has destroyed and
scattered valuable libraries; in the cities
of Petrograd and Moscow books and
valuable documents are being burned as
fuel in order to keep from freezing. I
feel that Stanford is very fortunate in
getting this collection."
When the war broke out in Europe
Professor Miliukov, in the late summer
and early autumn of 1914, transferred
his whole collection of books to Finland
and placed them in the care of a German
farmer. He did this because he belived
that the Germans would make a landing
in Finland and would secure possession
of that land as well as Petrograd and
felt that if that happened the books
would be safe in the hands of a German
in Finland. As it turned out, the Ger
mans did not make their landing in Fin
land and the Russian government, sus
pecting all the Germans in, Finland, had
the German farmer arrested and sent
to Siberia for a time. Fortunately, how
ever, the books were left undisturbed in
their boxes.
When Professor Golden reached Fin
land in search of the books, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Holtsi, detailed an offic
er to go with him to Terijoki. Golder,
therefore, took an automobile trip to
the German's farm. After a long ride
and a short walk through the forest they
came to the barn where the German had
placed the books and quickly arranged
with the farmer to pay the storage
charges and take the books away. He
left an additional sum with .the Finish
officer to pay the German for strength
ening the pack ng boxes and hauling
them to the station. The officer agreed
further to see that they were shipped to
Helsingfors, from which point word was
received that they had been shipped
December 2.

land in 1914 at the outbreak of the war.
The acquisition o fthis notable gift is

Piofessor Frank A. Colder, who is now
in Europe gathering material for the
Hoover War Collection, met Dr. Miliu
kov in London last September. He had
known Miliukov before and during the
war, and the Russiain historian at this
London meeting proposed that he would
like to present his library to Stanford
University. He had not seen it since
1914, when he stored it with a German
farmer in Helingfors, and was fearful
lest it would be altogether lost.
As a matter of fact when Professor
Colder, with some difficulty and only
with the aid qf the Finnish Foreign
: Secretary Holtsi, got into touch with
: this farmer, he found that the farmer,
eager to get his storage charges was
! considering accepting offers to purchase
it.
Miliukov is one of Russia's most dis
tinguished historians and was Professor
of history at the University of Moscow.
Ht was a political leader of the liberal
j "cadet group" of constitutional demo
crats in the Duma. In the revolution of
! 1917 he became Secretary of Foreign
Affairs but was forced to resign in May
1 1917, because of his effort to hold Rus
sia faithful to the allies. He was forced
jto flee from Russia when the Bolshe
viki siezed the power and has been a
| fugitive from Russia since that time.
Of the Miliukov library Professor
I Colder writes:
"From all accounts it is an unusual
I collection 011 Russia history and 1 may
say with certainty that Stanford will
have the best Russian history collection
oust of the Atlantic coast. This collec
tion is a beginning and in time I trust
that we may have one of the few great
collections in the country. You have
r. l idea how scarce Russia boyks have
become. The Bolos have nationalized
all book stores so that it is practically
impossible to buy anything in the open
market. The war has destroyed and
scattered valuable libraries; in the cities
of Petrograd and Moscow books and
valuable documents are being burned as
fuel in order to keep from freezing. I
feel that Stanford is very fortunate in
getting this collection."
When the war broke out in Europe
Professor Miliukov, in the late summer
and early autumn of 1914, transferred
his whole collection of books to Finland
and placed them in the care of a German
farmer. He did this because he belived
that the Germans would make a landing
in Finland and would secure possession
of that land as well as Petrograd and
felt that if that happened the books
would be safe in the hands of a German
in Finland. As it turned out, the Ger
mans did not make their landing in Fin
land and the Russian government, sus
pecting all the Germans in, Finland, had
the German farmer arrested and sent
to Siberia for a time. Fortunately, how
ever, the books were left undisturbed in
their boxes.
When Professor Golden reached Fin
land in search of the books, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Holtsi, detailed an offic
er to go with him to Terijoki. Golder,
therefore, took an automobile trip to
the German's farm. After a long ride
and a short walk through the forest they
came to the barn where the German had
placed the books and quickly arranged
with the farmer to pay the storage
charges and take the books away. He
left an additional sum with .the Finish
officer to pay the German for strength
ening the pack ng boxes and hauling
them to the station. The officer agreed
further to see that they were shipped to
Helsingfors, from which point word was
received that they had been shipped
December 2.
Professor Paul Miliukov, tlie disting

of Foreign Affairs in tlie Russian gov
ernment after the revolution of 1917,
has presented the Stanford University
I.is entire private library, one of the fin
est apd most complete collections on
