# OPPORTUNITIES IN RUSSIA DISCUSSED By ILYA TOLSTOY
## Count Gives Further Account of Conditions in Interview Which Follows Lecture 
### Wylie Kilpatrick, '23 
That the value of the opportunities
open to Americans in the Russia of
today is problematical was the opini
on yesterday expressed by Count Ilya
Tolstoy in a personal interview.
"Certainly, the opportunities for
educators ave strictly de
clared the famous Russian. "While
there are openings for commercial
concerns which will appeal to Amer
icans, the nature and extent of these
opportunities will only be revealed by
the coming decade."
The difficulty of Americans in un
derstanding the Russian situation and
temperament is the most serious
handicap to those considering active
work in Russia, asserts Count Tol
stoy. "The ease with which foreign
ers are mislead by rumor and half
truths, regarding Russia, illustrates
this situation. Vanderbilt and others
who have recently toured Russia un
der the tutelage of the Bolshevists
have made optimistic reports which
falsify the real condition."
The connection i between the uni
versities and revolutionary and reform
movements was pointed out by Tol
stoy. The Russian college students
have always been revolutionary in
clined, but the distinction must be
drawn between the reford party which
the students aided and the "red"
radicals which the majority of uni
versity men and women refused to
support. While the colleges have
been sympathetic to a constitutional
government they have in the main
been opponents of Bolshevism.
"The intellectual leadership of the
Bolshevist faction has not been sup
plied by the Russian universities,"
continued Count Tolstoy, "but has
largely come from a group of Jews
drawn from many countries. Many
of the radical leaders were political
exiles before the war, some of them
living in the East Side of New York
City."
The universities of Russia face a
serious situation in the opinion of the
Russian lecturer. "The best profes
sors left Russia as they were perse
cuted during the first six months of
the Bolshevist regime and because of
their own opposition to Bolshevistic
methods. Numbers of the professors
were forced to sell newspapers or
clean streets in order to earn a liv
ing. Now that the "Reds" have driv
en out many professors the need for
university leadership is realized and
the Bolshevists are making ineffectual
attempts to draw the professors back
to Russia."
Significant changes in university
life were revealed by Tolstoy. Tn
contrast to the strict admission stan
dards of the colleges in the pre-war
days, entrance today is open to the
rough lavorers with inadequate pre
paration. Little semblence of regular
work is maintained at the present time
in the class rooms. However, the high
standards which formerly marked the
eighteen universities will again pre
vail, the Russian author predicted.

this situation. Vanderbilt and others
who have recently toured Russia un
der the tutelage of the Bolshevists
have made optimistic reports which
falsify the real condition."
The connection i between the uni
versities and revolutionary and reform
movements was pointed out by Tol
stoy. The Russian college students
have always been revolutionary in
clined, but the distinction must be
drawn between the reford party which
the students aided and the "red"
radicals which the majority of uni
versity men and women refused to
support. While the colleges have
been sympathetic to a constitutional
government they have in the main
been opponents of Bolshevism.
"The intellectual leadership of the
Bolshevist faction has not been sup
plied by the Russian universities,"
continued Count Tolstoy, "but has
largely come from a group of Jews
drawn from many countries. Many
of the radical leaders were political
exiles before the war, some of them
living in the East Side of New York
City."
The universities of Russia face a
serious situation in the opinion of the
Russian lecturer. "The best profes
sors left Russia as they were perse
cuted during the first six months of
the Bolshevist regime and because of
their own opposition to Bolshevistic
methods. Numbers of the professors
were forced to sell newspapers or
clean streets in order to earn a liv
ing. Now that the "Reds" have driv
en out many professors the need for
university leadership is realized and
the Bolshevists are making ineffectual
attempts to draw the professors back
to Russia."
Significant changes in university
life were revealed by Tolstoy. Tn
contrast to the strict admission stan
dards of the colleges in the pre-war
days, entrance today is open to the
rough lavorers with inadequate pre
paration. Little semblence of regular
work is maintained at the present time
in the class rooms. However, the high
standards which formerly marked the
eighteen universities will again pre
vail, the Russian author predicted.
