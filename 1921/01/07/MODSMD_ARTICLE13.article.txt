# SOCCER TEAM PRIMING UP FOR OLYMPIC GAME
## No Game Set For Tomorrow; Olympic Team Expected to Give Cardinals Hard Fight 
### 
No soccer game is on the schedule for
tomorrow. Coach Maloney has not yet
returned from his tirp to British Col
umbia with the rugby team, and 110
schedule other than the Olympic game
on January 15 has been fixed up in his
absence.
Practice in earnest got under way >es
terciay afternoon when the squad v.plit
up into two teams and had a practice
game. Sid Adam=, ' 17 , captain of the
1917 soccer team, was on hand to give

means that it is a powerful combination.
Rumors from San Francisco seem to
indicate ;hut the Olympic team is a
dark horse that is growing stronger as
the season progresses, and .perts who
wish to prophesy the result when the
Cardinal squad locks horns with the
clubmen are taking a big chance in say
ing anything definite. At the first of the
season the Olympic team was nit blaz
ing any trail of fire in the league, and
it was thought at the time that Califor
nia would be the one Stanford would
have to down to retain the league leader
ship. But in the last few weeks the
San Francisco team has shown such a
great improvement that tt has proved
itself able, in a practice game, to defeat
the leaders of one of tins city leagues.
Therefore it looks likely that the mast
ery of the league has not yet been settled
and will not he until a week from Sat
urday.
Stanford's backfield has always per
formed consistently and when the occa
sion called for it, brilliantly. It has been
in the forward line that the vulnerable
spot lias been found, and if Coach Ma
loney can make this part of the team
air-tight, chances of victory are very
good. At that, this weakness has not
been glaring, as evidenced by the fact
that the Cardinal soccerites have not yet
been defeated this season, and have been
tied only once, by California. Consistent
practice and good coaching have of
course contributed to this success, but
one of the outstanding factors is the
undisputed, individual ability of -every
man on the team. Besides this., there
have been extra men as substitutes who
are practically as good as the tegulars,
and this has minimized the danger of
accidents wrecking the leatn completely.
At the present time Stanford stands at
the top of the league ladder. California
is on the next rung, hut the Olympics
are coming up fast, and the game on a
■week from Saturday will test the ability
of the Cardinal soccer team to stand in
the rarefied atmosphere of ttn top with
out toppling over.

means that it is a powerful combination.
Rumors from San Francisco seem to
indicate ;hut the Olympic team is a
dark horse that is growing stronger as
the season progresses, and .perts who
wish to prophesy the result when the
Cardinal squad locks horns with the
clubmen are taking a big chance in say
ing anything definite. At the first of the
season the Olympic team was nit blaz
ing any trail of fire in the league, and
it was thought at the time that Califor
nia would be the one Stanford would
have to down to retain the league leader
ship. But in the last few weeks the
San Francisco team has shown such a
great improvement that tt has proved
itself able, in a practice game, to defeat
the leaders of one of tins city leagues.
Therefore it looks likely that the mast
ery of the league has not yet been settled
and will not he until a week from Sat
urday.
Stanford's backfield has always per
formed consistently and when the occa
sion called for it, brilliantly. It has been
in the forward line that the vulnerable
spot lias been found, and if Coach Ma
loney can make this part of the team
air-tight, chances of victory are very
good. At that, this weakness has not
been glaring, as evidenced by the fact
that the Cardinal soccerites have not yet
been defeated this season, and have been
tied only once, by California. Consistent
practice and good coaching have of
course contributed to this success, but
one of the outstanding factors is the
undisputed, individual ability of -every
man on the team. Besides this., there
have been extra men as substitutes who
are practically as good as the tegulars,
and this has minimized the danger of
accidents wrecking the leatn completely.
At the present time Stanford stands at
the top of the league ladder. California
is on the next rung, hut the Olympics
are coming up fast, and the game on a
■week from Saturday will test the ability
of the Cardinal soccer team to stand in
the rarefied atmosphere of ttn top with
out toppling over.
No soccer game is on the schedule for
tomorrow. Coach Maloney has not yet
returned from his tirp to British Col
umbia with the rugby team, and 110
schedule other than the Olympic game
on January 15 has been fixed up in his
absence.
