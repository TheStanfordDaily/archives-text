# ATHLETIC TRIPS

### 
There can be no better advertisement for Stanford athletics than
periodical trips for the major athletic teams. It is the experience of the
Eastern colleges that make a practice of sending their major athletic
varsities on periodical trips, that considerable athletic material is brought
to the university as a result of the advertising secured. A team in tennis,
swimming, track, and baseball is sent on an extended trip once in four
years during the vacation months. This system assures men playing on
these teams a chance for a trip during their college course, and besides
stimulating competition, draws high school athletes to the university.
Stanford has sent several athletic teams away, but it Iras not been
done in an organized way. During the last few years, nothing has been
done of importance in this line, and the short trips for the teams that
have been allowed have come only by constant urging on the part of
interested team members.
To get the proper advertisement out of an extended trip, some one
of the varsity teams should leave the campus each summer, and with
proper advertisement the trip would soon become an important feature
of Stanford athletics, and their fame would naturally reach the ears of
high school men.
Stanford is in need of some such a system, and it cannot be inau
gurated too soon. The institutions that use this custom have no trouble
in scheduling contests for their trips, and guarantees are always easily
made. Stanford teams can make similar journeys through the East, to
the Orient, and to Central and South America, and it would be a great
aid to the University.
