# U. C. WILL ADVANCE TUITION RATES FOR ALL NON-RESIDENTS
## 
### 
1 California wilt raise the tuitipn for
non-residents of the state to $150 per
year beginning with the fall semester
that starts early in August. The deci
sion was made by the Regents of the
university at their mpeting Tuesday in
San Francisco. Heretofore the tuition
has been $20 per year to students who
are not residents of the state but the
defeat of the recent proposed Amend
ment 12, to give the state university the
return from a direct realty tax, has
forced the Regents to find some other
method of raising the necessary funds
to finance the increased expenses of the
university.
Twenty per cent of the university reg
istration is from students outside the
state according to a statement of Pres
ident David P. Barrows. Last October
there were over 1100 students from other
states and countries registered in the
University of California.
It is the belief of the Regents that
the State legislature will act more fav
orably on the proposed $8,000,000 appro
priation asked by the university now
t iat the expenses of non-resident stu
etits arc taken carc of by the imposi
ion of a larger tuition fee.
