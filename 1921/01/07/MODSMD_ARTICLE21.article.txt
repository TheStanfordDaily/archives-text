# W. D. ALLEN, UNIVERSITY ORGANIST AND DIRECTOR
## 
### 
The constantly growing interest in
music at Stanford, particularly among
students, is in the most part to be
attributed to the efforts and work of
Warren IX Allen, who has worked
with them with untiring enthusiasm
in the development of this compara
tively new field. In addition to his
duties as University organist and di
rector of the choir, he is directing the
student glee clubs and orchestra. His
position is one which is distinctly
different from other branches of de
partmental work, although it closely
supplements that of other depart
ments, and as the guiding force he
has advanced and stimulated musical
activity here with surprising success.
Our educational institutions in the
West, and particularly in California,
are just beginning to wake up to and
to realize the value of music in edu
cation, Mr. Allen believes, and it is
in this direction"~'that he is most in
terested and has spent most of his
time and effort. The opportunities for
the development of departments of
music in our schools and universities
are great, and it is his belief that
in a very short time there will be de
partments in all our institutions in
which students may obtain as com
plete professional courses in music
as in other subjects.
Mr. Allen was born in San Jose and
has spent most of his life in this part
of the state. His interest in music
has always been uppermost from a
very early age, his first appearance
as an organist being at a church ser
vice, when the organist failed to ap
pear. He was then only twelve years
old and had never touched an organ,
having only been a spectator. This,
however, made no difference to the
young musician.
Mr. Allen's first experience as a
musical organizer and director was
in high school and the old days when
music had no place in the curriculum.
Under his leadership, ithe students
organized their own band, orchestra
and quartet, Mr. Allen directing the
orchestra while playing the piano. It
was at this time that he became in
terested in the work of directing and
organizing. When in high school he
began teaching music, riding to the
homes of the pupils on a bicycle every
Saturday. He received a scholarship
on his graduation from high school
in 1903 which led to the University
| of California. While there he was
| very much interested in college glee
clubs and began to see the possibili
ties for music in the university. He
acted as accompanist for the Califor
nia Glee Club, then under the direc
tion of Dr. H. J. Stewart, and toured

with them, playing at the St. Louis
exposition of 1904.
This was the turning point in Mr.
Allen's musical education, for since
the university offered no opportuni
ties in the field of music, he decided
to leave the university and devote him
self to piano and organ work with
Hugo Mansfeldt of San Francisco.
From 1903 to 1911 Mr. Allen located
in Berkeley, studying and teaching.
Many of his pupils since than have
received distinct recognition up and
down the Coast. Most of Mr. Allen's
early organ was done around the
bay. He directed choirs at this time
in two Berkeley churches and in the
Temple of Sherith Israel in San Fran
cisco. He first entered organ work in ;
California through William B. King,!
who first interested him in the French
school of organ playing, which he |
studied later in Paris.
The next three years Mr. Allen spent
studying in Europe, his entire edu
cation being so to speak, self-endowed.
He went first to then the
Mecca of musical artists and students,
where he studied with Rudolph Ganz
and Alex von Fielitz. At the close of
the first season he went to Paris,
studying en route in the master class
of Busori, in Basel, Switzerland. In
Paris Mr. Allen devoted himself to
the study of the organ with Widor.
He returned to Berlin in 1911, where
he was engaged in further study be
fore returning to America.
In 1913 Mr. Allen took up his work
at the College of the Pacific at San
Jose acting as Dean of the Conserva
tory of Music in that institution. It
was upon his return from Europe that
he met Mrs. Allen, then Miss Esther
Louise Houk, who was teaching in
the University of California summer
session. They were married in Indi
anapolis on December 30, 1912. Mrs.
Allen also taught at the College of
the Pacific and she and Mr. Allen
•have concertized extensively together,
both here and in the East.
Mr. Allen was one of the organ
soloists and choral conductors at
Festival Hall at the Panama-Pacific
Exposition in April, 1915, and was
guest organist at the Panama-Califor
nia exposition in 1915 and 1916. He
also acted in the capacity of piano
soloist with the San Francisco Phil
harmonic Orchestra under Herman
Perlet, as v organist for the Trinity
Episcopal Church in San Jose, and as
sub-dean, San Jose Branch. A. G. O.
He is an Associate of the American
Guild of Organists, and honorary eca
demic degree conferred by that or
ganization.

in this direction"~'that he is most in
terested and has spent most of his
time and effort. The opportunities for
the development of departments of
music in our schools and universities
are great, and it is his belief that
in a very short time there will be de
partments in all our institutions in
which students may obtain as com
plete professional courses in music
as in other subjects.
Mr. Allen was born in San Jose and
has spent most of his life in this part
of the state. His interest in music
has always been uppermost from a
very early age, his first appearance
as an organist being at a church ser
vice, when the organist failed to ap
pear. He was then only twelve years
old and had never touched an organ,
having only been a spectator. This,
however, made no difference to the
young musician.
Mr. Allen's first experience as a
musical organizer and director was
in high school and the old days when
music had no place in the curriculum.
Under his leadership, ithe students
organized their own band, orchestra
and quartet, Mr. Allen directing the
orchestra while playing the piano. It
was at this time that he became in
terested in the work of directing and
organizing. When in high school he
began teaching music, riding to the
homes of the pupils on a bicycle every
Saturday. He received a scholarship
on his graduation from high school
in 1903 which led to the University
| of California. While there he was
| very much interested in college glee
clubs and began to see the possibili
ties for music in the university. He
acted as accompanist for the Califor
nia Glee Club, then under the direc
tion of Dr. H. J. Stewart, and toured

with them, playing at the St. Louis
exposition of 1904.
This was the turning point in Mr.
Allen's musical education, for since
the university offered no opportuni
ties in the field of music, he decided
to leave the university and devote him
self to piano and organ work with
Hugo Mansfeldt of San Francisco.
From 1903 to 1911 Mr. Allen located
in Berkeley, studying and teaching.
Many of his pupils since than have
received distinct recognition up and
down the Coast. Most of Mr. Allen's
early organ was done around the
bay. He directed choirs at this time
in two Berkeley churches and in the
Temple of Sherith Israel in San Fran
cisco. He first entered organ work in ;
California through William B. King,!
who first interested him in the French
school of organ playing, which he |
studied later in Paris.
The next three years Mr. Allen spent
studying in Europe, his entire edu
cation being so to speak, self-endowed.
He went first to then the
Mecca of musical artists and students,
where he studied with Rudolph Ganz
and Alex von Fielitz. At the close of
the first season he went to Paris,
studying en route in the master class
of Busori, in Basel, Switzerland. In
Paris Mr. Allen devoted himself to
the study of the organ with Widor.
He returned to Berlin in 1911, where
he was engaged in further study be
fore returning to America.
In 1913 Mr. Allen took up his work
at the College of the Pacific at San
Jose acting as Dean of the Conserva
tory of Music in that institution. It
was upon his return from Europe that
he met Mrs. Allen, then Miss Esther
Louise Houk, who was teaching in
the University of California summer
session. They were married in Indi
anapolis on December 30, 1912. Mrs.
Allen also taught at the College of
the Pacific and she and Mr. Allen
•have concertized extensively together,
both here and in the East.
Mr. Allen was one of the organ
soloists and choral conductors at
Festival Hall at the Panama-Pacific
Exposition in April, 1915, and was
guest organist at the Panama-Califor
nia exposition in 1915 and 1916. He
also acted in the capacity of piano
soloist with the San Francisco Phil
harmonic Orchestra under Herman
Perlet, as v organist for the Trinity
Episcopal Church in San Jose, and as
sub-dean, San Jose Branch. A. G. O.
He is an Associate of the American
Guild of Organists, and honorary eca
demic degree conferred by that or
ganization.
The constantly growing interest in
music at Stanford, particularly among
students, is in the most part to be
attributed to the efforts and work of
Warren IX Allen, who has worked
with them with untiring enthusiasm
in the development of this compara
tively new field. In addition to his
duties as University organist and di
rector of the choir, he is directing the
student glee clubs and orchestra. His
position is one which is distinctly
different from other branches of de
partmental work, although it closely
supplements that of other depart
ments, and as the guiding force he
has advanced and stimulated musical
activity here with surprising success.
Our educational institutions in the
West, and particularly in California,
are just beginning to wake up to and
to realize the value of music in edu
cation, Mr. Allen believes, and it is
in this direction"~'that he is most in
terested and has spent most of his
time and effort. The opportunities for

however, made no difference to the
young musician.
Mr. Allen's first experience as a
musical organizer and director was
in high school and the old days when
music had no place in the curriculum.
Under his leadership, ithe students
organized their own band, orchestra
and quartet, Mr. Allen directing the
orchestra while playing the piano. It
was at this time that he became in
terested in the work of directing and
organizing. When in high school he
began teaching music, riding to the
homes of the pupils on a bicycle every
Saturday. He received a scholarship
on his graduation from high school
in 1903 which led to the University
| of California. While there he was
| very much interested in college glee
clubs and began to see the possibili
ties for music in the university. He
acted as accompanist for the Califor
nia Glee Club, then under the direc
tion of Dr. H. J. Stewart, and toured

with them, playing at the St. Louis
exposition of 1904.
This was the turning point in Mr.
Allen's musical education, for since
the university offered no opportuni
ties in the field of music, he decided
to leave the university and devote him
self to piano and organ work with
Hugo Mansfeldt of San Francisco.
From 1903 to 1911 Mr. Allen located
in Berkeley, studying and teaching.
Many of his pupils since than have
received distinct recognition up and
down the Coast. Most of Mr. Allen's
early organ was done around the
bay. He directed choirs at this time
in two Berkeley churches and in the
Temple of Sherith Israel in San Fran
cisco. He first entered organ work in ;
California through William B. King,!
who first interested him in the French
school of organ playing, which he |
studied later in Paris.
The next three years Mr. Allen spent
studying in Europe, his entire edu
cation being so to speak, self-endowed.
He went first to then the
Mecca of musical artists and students,
where he studied with Rudolph Ganz
and Alex von Fielitz. At the close of
the first season he went to Paris,
studying en route in the master class
of Busori, in Basel, Switzerland. In
Paris Mr. Allen devoted himself to
the study of the organ with Widor.
He returned to Berlin in 1911, where
he was engaged in further study be
fore returning to America.
In 1913 Mr. Allen took up his work
at the College of the Pacific at San
Jose acting as Dean of the Conserva
tory of Music in that institution. It
was upon his return from Europe that
he met Mrs. Allen, then Miss Esther
Louise Houk, who was teaching in
the University of California summer
session. They were married in Indi
anapolis on December 30, 1912. Mrs.
Allen also taught at the College of
the Pacific and she and Mr. Allen
•have concertized extensively together,
both here and in the East.
Mr. Allen was one of the organ
soloists and choral conductors at
Festival Hall at the Panama-Pacific
Exposition in April, 1915, and was
guest organist at the Panama-Califor
nia exposition in 1915 and 1916. He
also acted in the capacity of piano
soloist with the San Francisco Phil
harmonic Orchestra under Herman
Perlet, as v organist for the Trinity
Episcopal Church in San Jose, and as
sub-dean, San Jose Branch. A. G. O.
He is an Associate of the American
Guild of Organists, and honorary eca
demic degree conferred by that or
ganization.
