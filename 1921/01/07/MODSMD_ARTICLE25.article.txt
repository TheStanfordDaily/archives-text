"The United States must get busy
if she is expecting to maintain her
lead in South American trade," said

Trade Commissioner of the Chilean
Government to the United States, at
the meeting of the Foreign Trade Club
in San Francisco, Wednesday night.
Several members of the Stanford
Economics Club were present as
guests of the Foreign Trade Club.
Germany is recuperating from the
war with astonishing rapidity, accord
ing to Barrows, and the German com
mercial instinct has all ready re
established that nation in a leading
place in South American trade. The
German policy of meeting business
demands by supplying the particular
type of articles needed in a certain
section is causing a great increase in
consumption of Germou- made goods.
England and France are rapidly ex
panding in their South American ac
tivities, said Barrows, and the United

she is to maintain her present posi
tion.
