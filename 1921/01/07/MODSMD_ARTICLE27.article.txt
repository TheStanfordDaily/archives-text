# DR. FRANZ WiLL GIVE LECTURES NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The lectures which Dr. Franz is giv
ing have been transferred from the Psy
chological Lecture room to the Little
Theatre, due to the fact that the grow
ing popularity of Dr. Franz's lectures
have overcrowded the smaller room.
Monday morning at 9 o'clock Dr. Franz
will lecture upon "Mental Abnormali
ty" and Tuesday morning at the same
hour he will lecture upon "Delusion," in
stead of on Wednesday morning, as pre
piously announced.
Tonight the students at the Stanford
Medical School in San Francisco will
hear Dr. Franz on "re-education. Dr.
Bassctt's class in English 50 will meet
on Monday morning in the Psychologi
cal Lecture Room, 414, instead of in
the Little Theatre.
