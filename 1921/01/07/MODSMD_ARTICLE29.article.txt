# LOUIS GRAVEURE WILL SING HERE JANUARY 20
## Noted Artist Will Appear in Second Concert of Healy Series in Assembly Hall 
### 
Louis Graveure, the noted Belgian
baritone, will make his third appearance
at Stanford in the second of the Frank
W. Healy concert series to be given
Thursday night, January 20, in the As
sembly Hall.
Graveure is considered one of the
finest baritones now appearing on the
concert stage. His rise to fame has been
rapid since his first appearance in
America several years ago, when he
sprang from obscurity and received an
immediate and enthusiastic reception in
the music world both here and in Eu
rope. He has delighted his audiences
at both his former Stanford appearances
and critics agree that in the past two
years he has made tremendous strides.
His next concert should therefore be
most interesting both to those who have
heard him before and to those who have
yet to hear the artist for the first time.
Graveure has chosen a wide and com
prehensive program, which opens with a
group of Russian songs, and will include
English, French and Hungarian numb
ers. In addition to the songs indicated
on his program, Graveure will also sing
several other numbers, probably among
them the "Prologue" from "Pagliacci."
