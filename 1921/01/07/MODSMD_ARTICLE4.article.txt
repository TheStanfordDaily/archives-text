# FINAL BASKETBALL CUT IS TUESDAY
## Coach Seay to Name Frosh Players of Squad to Form Quintet For Winter Quarter 
### 
With forty men reporting for prac
tice every night the freshman basket
ball team has made but little pro
gress in the past week. Coach Seay,
though, announces that he has been
getting a general idea of the team and
the playing ability of the different
men out for the squad and also that
there will be the second and final cut
in the squad next Tuesday. This cut
will leave but twelve or fifteen men
on the squad and will allow him more
time for each player and to find the
faults of the team. Right now Coach
Seay is busy picking the men for the
squad and in planning plays to be
used when there is more specializa
tion. He plans to form groups and
let they play together so that they
will be accustomed to one another,
and so that more efficient teamwork
can be had. This does not mean that
these men will always play together,
but it will do a great deal of good
in developing team work.
Although no definite sets of plays
will be used all the time the coach
is planning a system of positions that
bids fair of out-classing those now in
use by other schools and universities.
Little can be said about this system
at present but it is a well known fact
that a team that is used to fixed plays
works well when their center has the
"touch off" but are entirely swamped
when their opponents have the ball.
Even with the touch off the team can
not always get the ball and the best
team in the world is bound to lose
it now and then. Seay's system takes
these facts into consideration and al
though he will use some definite plays
and signals he will always have hiß
men in position to play the offensive.
The first game for the freshmen
comes off next Wednesday night at
Encina Gym. This game will give the
coach a chance to pick the faults of
his team and will also give the fans
a chance to see the babe quintet in
action. The game will be played either
with Palo Alto High School or the
Mountain View High School, and al
though they have good prep school
teams the freshmen ought not have
much trouble in defeating them. From
then on the games will be played
every Wednesday and Saturday nights.
Graduate Manager Martin has not yet
completed the schedule but it will
be ready for publication soon.
When asked about the players them
selves, Coach Seay was rather silent.
He said he had a good many pros
pects and if they turned out as good
as he thought they would he hoped
to have a speedy five. Two or three
players that he had counted this quar
ter are not eligible but even with this
handicap his men are already show
ing up good. Many new players have
come out this quarter and he hopes
to make up the loss with these. There
are, however, a few men whose abili
ty is looming above the rest. These
are McHose, at forward, Jensen at
center, and Bragg at guard. With
these men as a nucleus he hoped to
build the rest of the team around them
and come out'with the best freshman
basketball team that Stanford haß ever
produced.

"touch off" but are entirely swamped
when their opponents have the ball.
Even with the touch off the team can
not always get the ball and the best
team in the world is bound to lose
it now and then. Seay's system takes
these facts into consideration and al
though he will use some definite plays
and signals he will always have hiß
men in position to play the offensive.
The first game for the freshmen
comes off next Wednesday night at
Encina Gym. This game will give the
coach a chance to pick the faults of
his team and will also give the fans
a chance to see the babe quintet in
action. The game will be played either
with Palo Alto High School or the
Mountain View High School, and al
though they have good prep school
teams the freshmen ought not have
much trouble in defeating them. From
then on the games will be played
every Wednesday and Saturday nights.
Graduate Manager Martin has not yet
completed the schedule but it will
be ready for publication soon.
When asked about the players them
selves, Coach Seay was rather silent.
He said he had a good many pros
pects and if they turned out as good
as he thought they would he hoped
to have a speedy five. Two or three
players that he had counted this quar
ter are not eligible but even with this
handicap his men are already show
ing up good. Many new players have
come out this quarter and he hopes
to make up the loss with these. There
are, however, a few men whose abili
ty is looming above the rest. These
are McHose, at forward, Jensen at
center, and Bragg at guard. With
these men as a nucleus he hoped to
build the rest of the team around them
and come out'with the best freshman
basketball team that Stanford haß ever
produced.
With forty men reporting for prac
tice every night the freshman basket
ball team has made but little pro
gress in the past week. Coach Seay,
though, announces that he has been
getting a general idea of the team and
the playing ability of the different
men out for the squad and also that
there will be the second and final cut
in the squad next Tuesday. This cut
will leave but twelve or fifteen men
on the squad and will allow him more
time for each player and to find the
faults of the team. Right now Coach
Seay is busy picking the men for the
squad and in planning plays to be
used when there is more specializa
tion. He plans to form groups and
let they play together so that they
will be accustomed to one another,
and so that more efficient teamwork
can be had. This does not mean that
these men will always play together,
but it will do a great deal of good
in developing team work.
Although no definite sets of plays
will be used all the time the coach
is planning a system of positions that
bids fair of out-classing those now in
use by other schools and universities.
Little can be said about this system
at present but it is a well known fact
that a team that is used to fixed plays
works well when their center has the
"touch off" but are entirely swamped
when their opponents have the ball.
Even with the touch off the team can
not always get the ball and the best
team in the world is bound to lose
it now and then. Seay's system takes
