# PROF. A. B. CLARK HAS NEW BOOK ON BUILDING ART
## Art Principles in the Building of House, Furniture, and the Village, Theme of Work 
### 
The Stanford University Press has
just issued "Art Principles in House,
Furniture, and Village Building," by
Professor Arthur Bridgman Clark of
the Division of Graphic Art. The book
with its 130 pages and more than 200
illustrations, is a compact compendium
of the principles of beauty and conven
ience in building. It will be found help
ful to intending builders and to those
who are considering improvements in
houses already constructed and will be
appreciated by people who enjoy inspect
ing houses, new or old, with an apprecia
tion of their good points.
Professor Clark in his Introduction
speaks of this latter point. He says:
"To possess precise working methods
in observation of good art, and to apply
these methods constantly in observation
of houses, gardens, and cities is to de
velop a knowledge of the 'reason why'
for likes and dislikes. If enough people
'reason why,' the result will be a national
consciousness of design, the basis of a
critical public sentiment which it will be
dangerous to offend. No condition of
what we call culture is more to be de
sired."
The subject is treated in three parts:
The exterior, which includes a discus
sion of block organization, proportions,
elaboration of details, and styles of
domestic architecture; floor plans and
interiors, in which are discussed the
science and art of room arrangement,
the economy of compact kitchen appoint
ments and interior decoration and furn
ishing; and house surroundings in which
the principles of city planning and yard
planting are briefly set forth.
To many people Professor Clark's
chapter on "The Kitchen and Pantries"
will prove one of the most interesting
and helpful in the volume. This chapter
is illustrated with diagrams and photo
graphs of conveniently arranged kitch
ens, and discusses work in the kitchen as
it might lie organized for greatest con
venience.
His chapter on "Furniture" will also
be illuminating to many people since,
within brief limits, it presents conven
iences and principles of comfort and
beauty in an intelligible manner.
The book is the outgrowth of class
room lectures but. although it could well
serve as a text book for classroom
work, it will find a wide usefulness
among people who are either contem
plating building or are merely interested
in the subject.
The volume is attractively bound in
two shades of blue with cloth back and
decorative paper sides.
Many of the two hundred and three
illustrations show familiar homes of
Palo Alto and the Campusi many others
arc found in San Jose, San Mateo and
Berkeley, while not a few are taken
from Southern California and from
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New
York. These illustrations arc from
photographs taken by the author.
