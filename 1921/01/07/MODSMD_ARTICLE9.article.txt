# ALVAN WENDT '17 TO TAKE PART IN MASQUER'S PLAY
## Character Work and Unique Costuming Will Be Main Features of Coming Farce 
### 
Alvan W. Wcndt, '17, will take the
part of Sir William Gower in "Trelaw
ney of the Wells," comedy to be pro
duced by Masquers Society January 21
in the Assembly Hall. Three persons
have been chosen for this part, but due
to illness and scholarship the part has
been left vacant. Wendt is the logical
man to fill the place. His dramatic abil
ity was well demonstrated in "Ruther
ford and Son," produced by the English
Club last year. Wendt took the lead in
this play.
Sir William Gower is a stern and
forceful old gent. He exercises his
sternness to the nth degree, even to the
point where his actions are humorous.
Wendt showed the requirements of pro
ducing sternness on the stage in the
drama last year. In the second act of
the Masquer's production Gower domin
ates. Not only does Gower's sternness
add to the wit and fun of the second
act, but much comedy is found in the
painstaking attempts of Trafalga Gower,
his sister, to cover his naked ankles.
Rehearsals for the comedy have shown
a great improvement, according to Coach
Gordon Davis, the last two times. Al
though there is a lot of work yet to be
done, there will be adequate time to
shape the actors into prime working
conditions and to round of the rough
edges of the production.
The success of the play will lie mostly
in the character work. The humorous
farce is chucked to the brim with this.
Unique costuming and well conducted
lighting systems will also be features.
