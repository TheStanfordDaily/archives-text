# SEVENTY-SIX ARE DISQUALIFIED IN AUTUMN QUARTER
## Scholarship Committee Report Shows Campus Rumors to Be Without Foundation 
### 
Figures on last quarter's scholarship,
given out this morning, show that re
ports which have been circulating on
the campus for the past week have been
highly exaggerated. These figures, al
though larger than those of the autumn
quarter, indicate a general improvement.
Professor C. B. Whittier, chairman of
the scholarship committee, expressed a
belief this morning that within a year
the University will return to the former
figures in scholarship.
The number disqualified for further
work at Stanford last quarter way
seventy-six. There were fifty men put
or first failure and 127 placed on proba
tion. This compares with last year'f
autumn quarter figures of sijcty-eight
disqualifications, 132 failures, and 127
probations. The totals are 327 for last
year and 376 for this year. The increase
in probation docs not necessarily indi
cate a poorer grade of scholarship, as
the number is accumulative. If a stu
dent is once placed on probation he must
remain there until his University record
is back to standard. This means that
several now on probation are those who
are working off former probations or
first failures.
Estimates from the lower division
office show that fewer freshmen students
went on probation or were disqualified
than in former quarters.
Disqualification means that the stu
dent must stay out of the University
for twelve months, meanwhile having
made a good record at some other insti
tution. First failure is more serious
than probation in that two successive
quarters of first failure mean dismissal.
Probation prevents a student from tak
ing part in student activities and limits
the number of hours he is allowed to
take in the following quarter.
Under the new scholarship rulings, it
requires twenty-two counts to keep off
probation, seventeen counts to keep from
failing, and twelve counts to prevent
disqualification. Counts are units and
grade points combined. These require
ments are for an individual quarter.
However, the committee also considers
the student's general average. At the
end of the second quarter and' each fol
lowing quarter his past record is gone
over. If he has fallen from ten to
twenty points below normal he goes on
probation.
For lower division men in their first
two quarters the requirements are lower.
If they make less than twenty-two
counts they go on probation, less than
twelve on first failure, and less than
seven disqualification.
The general principle adopted by the
committee, as explained by Professor
\Vhittier this morning, is that a student
ought to be able to complete his college
course in five years. If his work shows
that he is not going to be able to do
this, he is disqualified.
Reports had gained considerable
ground on the campus during the last
week that 1,100 students had gone on
probation and 250 had "flunked out."
