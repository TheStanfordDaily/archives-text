# STANFORD COURT TEAM DEFEATS OLYMPIC CLUB ON LOCAL FLOOR, 42-34
## Cardinals Win First Contest of the Season by Fast Play; Richmond, Mills Star 
### 
Coach Powell's basketballers handed
a 42 to 34 defeat to the Olympic Club
in the first game of the court season,
Saturday night, in Encina Gymnasium.
A large crowd packed the gymnasium
to see the contest, which proved to be
a humdinger from start to finish.
The Stanford five jumped right into
the lead by dropping four through the
hoop within the first three minutes of
play. Then the San Franciscans warmed
to their work and from that time it
was a fight every inch of the way. The
score at half time was 21 to 18 in favor
of Stanford.
The Olympic aggregation perked up
after the fifteen-minute rest and starte l
to gain on the Cardinal varsity. Five
minutes before the final gun Johnson,
the Olympic forward, tossed a field goal
that tied the game at 34 all. It was an
even break for two minutes, with both
teams fighting hard for an advantage.
Dick Richmond broke loose in mid
court and made a long toss through the
basket that broke the tie. Stanford made
six more points before the gun sounded,
winning the contest.
Mills, Stanford center, was the indi
vidual star of the evening. He made 20
of the 42 points made by his team.
Seven field goals and six free throws
was the sum total of his efforts for the

evening. He was pressed for honors by
Johnson, Olympic forward, whose indi
vidual score was 13 points.
Referee Penaluna had a busy evening
trying to keep the boys from becoming
rough. After calling personal fouls on
everyone in sight and warning the
coaches of the two teams that he would
declare it no contest, he finally called
a halt while he read the two teams the
riot act. The score:
