# NARROW-MINDED ACTION
## 
### 
, A petition has been presented by a group of citizens of Palo Alto to
the local Chamber of Commerce protesting against a Filipino Club
which exists on Cowper Street. The petition has been endorsed by the
Chamber of Commerce officials. Nothing further has come of the en
dorsement, but it merely serves as an example of narrow-minded preju
dices which people of one race can hold against another. The Fili
pinos who arc members of the club arc students of the University and
are here after a higher education. They have done nothing out of the
u'ay as far as can be learned, except organized themselves into a club
for social and educational purposes. There is no law in this country
against such organizations, but the people in the vicinity of the Filipino
Club in Palo Alto and the Chamber of Commerce officials seem to think
that law or no law these students have not the right to live together.
Stanford University is known as a democratic institution, and all
students who have the desire to learn and fulfill the requirements arc
admitted without regard to color. The city of Palo Alto serves the
University to a large extent, and a large part of the town is given over
toward supplying the wants of the students and faculty of the Univer
sity. The policy of the University regarding students should be the
policy of the city of Palo Alto) and residence should not be refused to
any group of law-abiding students.
Such a policy is dangerous for any city to follow. The Filipinos
are not citizens of Japan, and any feeling against the Japanese, whether
founded on fact or not, should not be extended to the people of a coun
try which is a dependency of the United States. Racial prejudices should
I)e kept in check as much as possible, but when the feeling extends to
questioning the right of a number of students to organize themselves
into a club, it is going too far.
The members of the Filipino Club are Stanford students, and as
members of the student body they are entitled to all courtesy possible
ir Palo Alto as long as they do not break laws. The action of the citi
zens in signing the petition and the endorsement of the Chamber of
Commerce places the stamp of approval of Palo Alto on this discrimi
nation. It is not'less than a direct insult to Stanford University and
should not be tolerated.
