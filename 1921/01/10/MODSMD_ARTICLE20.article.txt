# DEAN CULVER, '97, PROVES A TRUE STANFORD MAN
## 
### 
Essentially a Stanford man himself, it
has taken George Bliss Culver, '97, only
a few months to establish himself com
pletely as a friend of Stanford students.
From the time he left the University
with the class of '97 until he returned
here last summer to take over the office
of Dean of Men, Culver has kept closely
in touch with Stanford and its progress.
Many a worth-while Stanford man has
first begun to think Stanford from hear
ing Dean Culver talk Stanford.
His work since he has returned to the
campus speaks for itself. We must not
look only for tangible illustrations of
what he has done, because the duties of
the office are such that the results are
not self-evident. It is more a task of
straightening out and smoothing over,
which task the new dean has shown
himself capable of handling.
This capability comes from long ex
perience with young men. He has been
in close touch with their interests.
While a student. Culver was active in
campus activities. He graduated from
the Zoology Department in 1897 and
went East, where he attended the
George Washington University; receiv
ing his B. L. degree in 1902. While
studying for this degree Dean Culver
was on the editorial staff of the Balti
more American, and also did some work
for the United States Treasury Depart
ment.
Returning West, he'was with the city
government of Ocean Park, California,
from 1904 to 1906. The next year he
became a teacher in the Los Angeles
High School, giving that up for the
principalship of Santa Monica High
School the following year. After a
year's work with the Smithsonian In
stitution, Culver returned to Los An
geles as head of the natural science de
partment in the high school, which posi
tion he held until coining to Stanford.

Dean Culver has gained a reputation
as a friend of clean athletics. He was
coach of the track team during his first
year in Los Angeles, and after that
always took a more or less active part
in handling the distance men. He has
followed Cardinal athletics with intense
interest, and he often finds time to get
away from his office to spend a few
minutes on the football field or in the
gymnasium, watching the men work out.
The specimens of animal life in his
office in the Administration Budding
are evidence of his interest in nature
and science. Graduating from the
Zoology Department and teaching nat
ural sciences have given him a more
than superficial knowledge of them. As
a hobby Culver s interested in out-of
door mountain work.
Writers have always had a friend in
George Culver. His newspaper work in
Baltimore placed him in touch with the
journalistic field. Aside from his science
work, Culver had a class in short story
writing in Los Angeles High School,
that was unique in that a majority of the
students took it several successive terms
without credit in order to receive his
instruction. He was faculty literary
editor of the semi-annual. Work on the
Interschool Debating Committee brought
him in contact with the debaters.
Three of the problems that Dean
Culver is helping Stanford authorities
to work out are more adequate housing
facilities, better eating accommodations,
and "a better understanding on the part
of the upperclassmen of what is in the
minds of the University authorities re
garding restrictions in the matter of the
so-called 'freshman s discipline.'" He
says that "there is a lot of sanity and
goodfellowship at Stanford." This is
what Dean Culver is trying to promoteâ€”
and he is succeeding.
