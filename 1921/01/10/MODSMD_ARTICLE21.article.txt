The clamor and wild disorder ac
companying D. P. A. tryouts is scarce
ly conducive to the manufacture and
publication of readable humor, yet ye
jokesmith must needs stick to the
sinking ship. He looks with dismay
upon the future and gleans no ray of
hope from the frantic cries of the
news editors to helpless underlings
for copy. 'Tis a sad note that strikes
the high C's in the storm.

In comparison of scholarship stan
dards in the past with the future, we
may well expect to read in the D. P. A.
in a few years that "only ninety-six
per cent of the students enrolled at
Stanford University were dismissed
this year for deficiency in scholar
ship, an unusually low percentage
when compared with the statistics of
the past three years which show 8995
dismlssials out of 9000 enrolled stu
dents. The university authorities will
probably be accused of unwarranted
leniency."ij

The new basketball pavilion must
be closely connected with academic
affairs. They're tacking the dollar
tax onto the syllabus fees. Still, that
doesn't make the tuition look so big.

Most people figure that a B, C, or D
plus is a theft. A drop more would
mean a bunch of honor points. That
is, a figurative drop. A minus after
each is a real gift. How about fifteen
hours of that stuff? Wouldn't that
be Merry Christmas? Drybawl Dan
says he got three C-plusses. Sand
bagged again, Daniel.

Professor Paul remarks that thero
ire three kinds of people in his class
es; those who enroll to fill out their
requirement, those who ditto to ditto
their schedule, and the remainder be
cause there was nothing else to take.
He says he'd like to arrange his
marks accordingly. Give the first
two another chance to fill out their
requirements and schedules again,
and convince tho remainder that there
is something else to take.

The Chinese pay their doctors when
they're we 11... In America., we., pay
them when we're sick. Grafter George
