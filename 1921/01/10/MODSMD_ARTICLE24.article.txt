# OPPORTUNITY OPEN FOR RESEARCH IN THE HUNTINGTON LIBRARY
## 
### 
There is an opportunity for Stanford
graduates to secure training in biblio
graphical research through work in the
Huntington Library, according to a let
ter received by Librarian G. G. Clark
from Marion Horton, '11, principal of
the Library Training School in Los
Angeles. The Huntington collection is
the only one of its kind in this country,
every volume being of a date prior to
1641. Professor J. S. P. Tatlock, of the
English Department, in commenting
upon the value of the various folios -and
manuscripts and the rare pieces of Cax
ton's Art which Huntington collected
prophesied that with these available, in
addition to the Stanford Librarv, and.
the historical collections of California
the coast is destined to become a center
for graduate research.
The letter received from Miss Horton
who acted as cataloguer while attending
here, afterwards received training at
the Library School in Albany, New
York, from which she went to the posi
tion of librarian in an Oakland high
school, the stepping stone to her present
position as principal of the Library
School of the Los Angeles Public Li
brary, is as follows:
"My Dear Mr. Clark: The Lns An
geles Librarv School is planning to
cooperate with the Huntington Library
in giving special training in biblio
graphical research. As you probably
know, only men are appointed to posi
tions on the Huntington staff but there
is a great demand there as elsewhere
for trained librarians, and I thought that
possibly you could suggest this work
tr> some Stanford graduates. We shall
be glad if you will tell us of any per
sons who might be interested in library
work, so that we can let them know of
the possibility s, both in Hunt,inglon
Library and in other kinds of library
work."
