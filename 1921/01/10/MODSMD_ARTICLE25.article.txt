# STATE UNIVERSITY IN MICHIGAN BADLY CRAMPED FOR SPACE
## 
### 
DETROIT, Mich., Jan. 10.â€”Housing
conditions in the University of Michi
gan are terribly, according to the
President, Marion L. Burton. He
* says the students are crowded into
rooms so small that they do not have
room for desks to write on. In the
dissecting rooms of the science de
partment the conditions are especi
ally crowded.
According to Mr. Burton's state
ment the rooms of the maternity hos
pital, which is maintained in connec
tion with the University, are so
crowded with beds that the doctors
in attendance have great difficulty in
making their way from bed to bed.
The engineering department is so
overcrowded that some of the stu
dents who entered last year and ex
pect to graduate in 1923 will be forced
to spend another~year in the Univer
sity in order to complete their courses.
President Burton says the museum
which contains relics of inestimable
value is housed in a fire trap. The
conditions of the whole plant are a
a "disgrace to Michigan," in the
words of the President.
Over 6000 students are enrolled in
the literature, science and art branch
es of the university, but only one new
building has been built in the last
fifty years.
