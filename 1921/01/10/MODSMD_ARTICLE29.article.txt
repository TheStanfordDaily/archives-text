# 'RE-EDUCATION OF PARALYTICS' WELL BE SUBJECT OF LECTURE
## 
### 
'"Re-education of Paralytics" will be
the subject of the lecture which Dr.
Shepherd Franz will deliver at the Little
Theater at 7:30 tomorrow night. Not
only is Dr. Franz an eminent authority
upon this subject, but he has had a very
great deal of experience in this line of
work. He is director of the Govern
ment Hospital for the Insane in Wash
ington, D. C., and here he has performed
many remarkable experiments. In many
'-ases he has been able to re-educate the
minds of paralytics to such an extent
that those who have been bedridden for
from three to thirteen years have been
able to go out on the baseball field and
play ball.
Dr. Franz's method of delivery is ex
tremely well suited to the subject, and
his lectures to the public arc given in
an untechnical manner. He has been
giving lectures to students in the psy
chology department here for several
days, and it has been necessary to give
them in the Little Theater even in the
mornings, since the popularity of his
talks has drawn large audiences.
Dr. Franz is editor oft the Psycholog
ical Bulletin and president of the Amer
ican Psychological Association, which
convened in Chicago in December. He
has contributed some seventy scientific
articles and monographs on his profes
sional subject, the function of the cere
brum relating to the re-education of
paralytics, and is considered an author
ity upon it.
