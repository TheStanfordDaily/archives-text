# VOCATIONAL TRAINING SUCCESSFUL ACCORDING TO DIVISIONAL OFFICER
## 
### 
"The records of Stanford vocational
students, and the showing of men
trained by the Federal Board in all
parts of the nation have proved that
the experiment of Federal vocational
education is a success, and that it
will be a permanent feature of our
government," declared Ira W. Kibby,
at the meeting of the Associated
Federal Students Friday night. Kibby
is assistant Divisional Vocational of
ficer for the Federal Board in the
Twelfth District, comprising Califor
nia. Arizona and Nevada.
"When vocational education was
first undertaken by the Government
it was an experiment, and there were
many who prophesied that it would
end in failure. But what you men
are doing, and the showing made by
those returned to employment shows
that the money spent by the people of
the United States in vocational educa
tion is an investment.
"Rehabilitation costs approximately
one fourth what pensions Would for
the same number of men, and the
benefits to society are multiplied many
times. The rehabilated men have
bigger things to live*for, they can do
for themselves, and their attitude to
ward life is made one of optimism.
Some who would be a dead weight on
society become producers, and their
products will return the cost of their
education many times over.
"Because the experiment has work
ed out so well thus far, there is no
doubt that the industrial rehabilita
tion plan recently adopted by Congress
will become a permanent function of
the Government. When this plan is
put into operation approximately one
million persons injured in industrial
pursuits will be trained yearly."
H. D. Hicker, Liaison officer, and
L. D. Denton, gave short talks. Den
ton was much pleased with the show
ing made by the Stanford men, some
of whom have made remarkable re
cords, he said.
Professor Proctor announced that
there had been a few "casualties from
the faculty axe, but the physical con
dition of the men was responsible for
nearly all of them." He also explain
ed the new regulations regarding
medical aid, and requested the men
to fill out information blanks at the
Federal Board Office, room 35.
A committee on scholarship was ap
pointed by President J. B. McNally,
'23. Committees were selected to
make preparations for an open dance,
to be given sometime in February,
and to chose a design for the club
pin. An appropriation was voted to
cover the expense of two pages in the
"Quad."
