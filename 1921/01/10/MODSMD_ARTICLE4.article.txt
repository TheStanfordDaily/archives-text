# UNIQUE ORIENTAL SKIT TO BE PLAYED TONIGHT BEFORE CORDA FRATRES
## 
### 
"Chinese Night" will be presented in
the reception room of the Women's
Clubhouse this evening at 8 o'clock by
the Chinese members of the Cosmo
politan Club. In addition to the local
members of the Chinese Club, imported
talent in the form of several Stanford
alumni, Chinese medical students in
Lane Hospital, and two or three young
ladies from Berkeley will be present.
Hong Wu, president of the local Chi
nese Club, made a special trip to San
Francisco last week-end and succeeded
in borrowing several hundred dollars
worth of embroideries and lanterns to
be used in the decorations.
The program will be varied, including
native Chinese music, songs, and dances.
There will also be Chinese stories and a
typical Chinese playlet. Incense will
largely aid in creating the proper atmos
phere for the affair.
"Chinese Night" is the first of a series
of programs being planned by the Cos
mopolitan Club, which exists for the
purpose of uniting the various groups
of foreign students on the campus with
the American students in an endeavor
to profit both by the mutual exchange
of ideas.
Cosmopolitan clubs in some of the
larger Eastern universities, such as
Harvard, Princeton, Michigan, and Cor
nell, hold a position of distinct promi
nence, having a membership sometimes
exceeding two hundred. The plans of
the local club call for an expansion
which will place the Stanford organiza
tion on a par with the societies in the
East.
The first step towards a more stable
club was taken last quarter, When the
Cosmopolitan Club became the Stanford
Chapter of Corda Fratres, National As
sociation of Cosmopolitan Clubs. Imme
diately letters began pouring into Leland
Stanford chapter from colleges and uni
versities all over the country asking
about Stanford.
"Chinese Night" will be entirely dif
ferent from every entertainment pre
viously conducted by the club. All for
eign students are cordially invited to
attend, and were it not for the limitation
which must be placed upon the number
of American students in the organiza
tion, everyone would be welcome. Under
the circumstances, only those holding
invitations can be admitted.
