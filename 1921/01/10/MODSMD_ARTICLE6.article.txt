# LIBRARIAN RETURNS FROM A YEAR'S TRIP AROUND THE WORLD
## 
### 
Librarian A. B. Clark is back at his
desk after a year's leave of absence,
during which time he made a trip
around the world. Dr. Clark found that
there is a great deal of red tape con
nected with all passports. (In Italy he
found it necessary to present a docu
ment bearing the vise of the American,
English, French and Italian embassies.)
But food is plentiful, and the conditions
of travel, outside of overcrowding, and
a disregard of time schedules in Italy,
is little different than in pre-war times.
Sailing westward from San Francisco
last January, Dr. Clark spent February
in Japan, leaving Kobe early in March
on the British-India steamship Tockada
for Calcutta via Hong Kong, Singa
pore and Rangoon. After traveling
through India, passage on a German
prize ship bound for England was se
cured with great difficulty. Owing to
the suspension of leaves of absence dur
ing the war, thousands of English peo
ple in India were eagerly seeking pas
sage, and as there were fewer ships in
service than in normal times there was
much congestion of passengers and ship
ping.
Dr. Clark was in England trom the 1
end of June until the latter part of
August. Owing to the readjustment now
in progress many private collections of
books are being thrown upon the mar
ket. Hence there were good opportuni
ties to make desirable purchases, espe
cially as the rate of exchange with the
pound sterling worth less in American
gold, that alone affected the equivalent
of a 20 per cent discount.
In France the purchasing power of
the dollar is even greater.
From England Dr. Clark went to
Paris and thence to Switzerland and
Italy, returning to London in October
to sail from Liverpool for Montreal,
October 22, on a Canadian Pacific ship,
which just escaped being held up by the
[coal strike then existing. Six weeks
were spent on the Atlantic coast and
further acquisitions were made from
hook dealers and from the duplicate col
lections of the large Eastern libraries.
Altogether about 11,000 volumes will
have been added to the Stanford Library
as a result of this tour.
