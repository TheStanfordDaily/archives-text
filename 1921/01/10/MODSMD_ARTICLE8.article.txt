### 
Louis Graveure, the next artist to
be presented by Frank W. Healey in
the Assembly Hall, on Thursday even
ing, January 20, is considered a bari
tone of consummate art and unlimited
praise, singing alike the great operatic
aria or the simplest English ballad.
The musically educated, as well as
those not so fortunate as to possess
musical education, never fail to go
into ecstasies over the Graveure
voice, which is at once rich and vi
brant, full of color, with high notes,
as pure and wonderful as the highest
notes of a lyric tenor.
Recently Graveure appeared at
Orchestra Hall, Chicago, and the very
exacting Karelton Hackett closed his
criticism by saying that there is not
a more satisfying baritone now ap
pearing before the public than Louis
Graveure.
Tickets for Graveure's Stanford con
ccrt will go on sale January 13, at
Crandall's in Palo Alto, and at the

ing. In order that the Assembly Hall
may be filled to its utmost capacity
Mr. Healy has reduced the prices to
$1 each, with a few seats at $1.50.
Graveure's present California tour,
this being his third, places him in
the ranks of "percentage" artists. In
stead of the usual set fee, and confi
dent of his ability to draw a large
aadienco, Graveure prefers to accept
a percentage of the gross receipts,
an arrangement that seldom fails to
yield him a return in excess of his
former fee of $1000 an appearance.
Only those artists who are sure of
cheir box office value, such as John
McCormaek, Galli-Curci, Geraldine
Farrar, Mary Garden and Fritz Kreis
ler, are willing to do this.
Graveure, who will arrive in San
Francisco several days in advance of
his first concert, is bringing with him
as accompanist, Edouard Gendron, who
is also considered a remarkable
pianist.
