# JANUARY CARDINAL TO APPEAR ON QUAD FOR SALE TOMORROW
## "Inflating the University" Is Title of Editorial Which Analyzes Campus Situation 
### 
Appearing on the Quad for sale to
morrow morning, The Cardinal will be
the first campus magazine to publish its
January issue. An unusual variety of
contents marks the initial number of the
year. Not only in the selected chapters
it contains of the autobiography of
David Starr Jordan, but in its articles,
verse and short stories, the January
Cardinal has succeeded in presenting an
issue of wide appeal.
"The Bondage of the Sea" is the
caption of a unique story by Haakon
Chevalier. The author recently stayed
out of school for a year in order to
tour the world in a windjammer. An
experience while on the trip in South
ern Africa forms the basis for the
sketch. While Cape Town, Africa, has
formed the background for much Eng
lish fiction, Chevalier's story is one of
the few American tales whose setting
is located in the South African city.
An article, critical but not sensational,
is the editorial, "Inflating the Univer
sity." The editor, avoiding the attitude
of a purely destructive critic, examines
recent developments in university life
and campus activities in the light of the
best in Stanford's history.
Another story in the O'Day series is
contributed by Howard Pease. A French
story, with the local color of Paris,
Pease has written an interesting chap
ter in the adventures of O'Day. With
a psychological basis the sketch is dis
tinctively humorous.
English translations from the Russian
poet, Pushkin, arc contained in the Jan
uary issue. Pushkin is considered by
many critics to be the foremost of Rus
sian poets, several of his poems appear
ing in The Cardinal will for the first
time receive an English publication.
