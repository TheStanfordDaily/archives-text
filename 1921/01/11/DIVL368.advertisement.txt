We'll Help You
Find It
If You Lose It
j By J. F. Haight *
Every morning in the San Francisco Chronicle
we run part of a column on "Lost and Found
Jewelry." If you lose a worthy article of
jewelry, tell us about it and we will insert an
ad n the proper classified section, describing
it. We recover quite a few lost articles. There
is no charge of any kind for the service, and
we pay for the ad.
This is an original "graft" with us, with the
sole purpose of doing a little good in the
world, and incidentally of earning the grati-
Itude of the beneficiaries. If you offer a re
ward it is paid to the person who finds and
returns the article, in accordance with your
instructions. Finders of jewelry have the
same privilege of locating the owners.
Stanford people are invited to make use of
this arrangement. But please call, do not
phone.
Diamonds and Jewelry in satisfactory assort
ments. Mail inquiries invited. Watch Repair
ing and Optical Departments.
