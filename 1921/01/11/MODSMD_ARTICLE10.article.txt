# SEAY MAKES CUT IN MEMBERS OF FRESHMAN SQUAD
## Seventeen Men Left to Fight For Place on Final Five; New Men Strengthen Team 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay cut the freshman
basketball squad last night to seven
teen men. His cut came earlier than
was expected and resulted from the
crowded condition of the gymnasium
facilities which kept the whole squad
from working under the direct super
vision of Coach Seay. He now has
the squad under control and will have
time tonight to make up the five which
will start the first game of the season,
tomorrow night. The freshmen meet
Palo Alto high school in the prelimin
ary for the Varsity-Santat Clara
fracas.
The addition of more than a dozen
new men to the squad since the
Christmas holidays has made the
picking of a small unit harder than
it would have been if the men had
been out longer for the sport. Coach
Seay states that some of the new
men who are out now will materially
boost the team's chances in the com
ing games of the season. He has had
a good many forwards but has lacked
guards and centers. Jansen is work
ing at center and is giving all aspir
ants a stiff run for their money.
McHose is leading the forwards with
his consistant work on the basket
shooting end and looks like a sure
thing for ope of the front-line po
sitions.
The squad will be cut to about
twelve men in the next couple of
weeks. There will be no single cut
according to Seay but men will be
dropped from the squad one by one
as they show they haven't the stuff to
keep them in the running with the
rest of the "Babes."
The seventeen men who stayed on
the squad after the recent falling of
the axe are:
N T . P. McHose, l>. Mannocir, L. Ala
baster, A. Smith, P. Proctcwr, N. Gran
ger, Wright, B. Taylor, J. Reeder, A.
Lowenstein, A. Bragg, Wittenberg, R.
Atwill, Cooper, Jensen, Tim Colvin.
