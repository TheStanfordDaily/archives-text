# PROFESSOR TREAT WILL SPEAK BEFORE EUPHRONIA SOCIETY
## 
### 
Professor Payson J. Treat of the His
tory Department will deliver an address
under the auspices of Euphronia De
hating Society Thursday evening, and
from the nature of subject which he
is to discuss it is evident that his talk
will be unusually interesting. The ad
dress. will be given in room 12 of the
Law Building at 7:30 Thursday evening.
Tlie topic which will be discussed by
Professor Treat is to be "Propaganda
and Public Opinion." He will outline
the relation of propaganda, especially as
conducted by bodies organized for that
purpose, to the moulding of public opin
ion, and its effcct upon the latter. It is
expected that a particularly interesting
part will be that in which he describes
the ejects of these two forces in the
Orient. As Professor Treat is a recog
nized authority on matters pertaining
to the Oriental countries, his discussion
of this phase of the subject will un
doubtedly be very valuable.
The question of propaganda, how far
it should go, what its nature should be,
and show it should be exercised, is one
of the important questions now con
fronting the public. Its relation to pub
lic opinion is, of course, very close, for
its origin and purpose arc founded from
the desire to modify public thinking.
How powerful its influence is on various
peoples: whether or not it is justifiable
In majority of casos, and the great
extent to which public opinion is swayed
by its various manifestations, all are
questions which can best be discussed
by Professor Treat.
