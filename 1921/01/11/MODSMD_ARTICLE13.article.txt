# "Y" PLANS DRIVE FOR THIS WEEK FOR MORE FUNDS
## Secretary Morgan Y. M. C. A. Summarizes Work and Plans For Organization 
### 
Representatives of the local Y. M. C.
A. will personally interview tiiis week
each student in the University for the
purpose of explaining the functions and
financial needs of the organization. An
nually the association conducts a finan
cial campaign in order to raise the neces
sary funds for carrying on its work.
The campaign was inaugurated yes
terday evening and will be continued
through the week, according to Secre
tary Morgan of the "Y." In a state
ment issued yesterday, thÂ» secretary ex
plained in detail the purposes of the
association and particularly the work
which he hopes the local branch will
accomplish.
The motto of the "Y" is service, and
its usefulness on the campus falls under
two general classes. First, the Y. M. C.
A. gives the freshman a proper intro
duction to Stanford by sending out the
"Frosh Bible" to every entering student
more than three weeks before school be
gins. Instead of being left to "get on
the boat" by himself, the "Y" provides
information bureaus, takes charge of
freshman assemblies, and assists the
first-year student in every way possible.
Men of standing are brought to the
campus to speak in the scries of World
Problems Forum meetings who would
never come here were it not for the
association. Professor Stratton of the
University of California, who spoke last
quarter upon "Where Has Psychology
Left Religion," was one of the more
popular speakers. George Sherwood
Eddy, the well-known world traveler,
and Sam Higgenbottom of India are
two of the speakers slated for this
quarter.
Deputations of Stanford men go to
various high schools in Northern Cali
fornia from time to time for the ex
press purpose of talking up clean think
ing aiid athletics. Incidentally yiesc men
keep an eye open for good athletic ma
terial and boost Stanford. If possible, a
basketball game between the high school
five and the deputation team is arranged,
and the proceeds help pay expenses, in
addition to giving the Stanford men a
line on future material for Cardinal
basketball teams.
One of the best means of "serving"
lies in the use of a loan fund, from
which small loans are made to students'
to help them pass over financial diffi
culties. Although this fund is limited,
it is open to all students, whether they
are members of the association or not.
The Y. M. C. A. is managed by means
of a cabinet of about twenty upper
classmen, assisted by a board of direc
tors consisting of eleven men, six of
whom are officers of the university.
Finances arc so arranged that all funds
contributed by the students go directly
to the work 'here at Stanford.
The Freshman Bible cost nearly five
hundred dollars this year. The deputa
tions form one of the most useful fea
tures of the "Y" work, and these cost
something also. Considerable expense
is attached to the Americanization, Hos
pital Visitation, and Charity work of
the association.
The local association exists for the
benefit of the students, and it not only
aids them but boosts Stanford in the
course of its work. There is no com
pulsion about giving, and this is not a
real "drive," no quotas are be
ing set upon each living group * m*
