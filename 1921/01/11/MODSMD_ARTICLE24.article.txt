# HELP THE Y. M. C. A.
## 
### 
During this week, members of the Stanford Y. AT. C. A. are en
gaged in a campaign to raise money to carry on their work for the
ensuing year. Financial campaigns are not always regarded with favor
it appears that this organization really deserves the financial support of
by the constantly'besieged students, but in the case of the Y. M. C. A.
the students.
During the past year the local office has done considerable in the
way of improving conditions on the campus and instituting new customs
and ideas. The freshman assemblies were started by the Y. M. C. A.
for the purpose of putting the new students "on the boat." The Fresh
man Bible is for the same purpose, and is published by the Y. M. C. A.,
and the local office was instrumental in the organization of the Filipino
Club. Religious work is carried on in Discussion Groups which meet
Sunday mornings in the Memorial Church and in the churches in Palo
Alto. Prominent speakers are brought to the University under the
auspices of the national organization of the Young Men's Christian
Association.
A survey of the progress made and results accomplished by the
Stanford Y. M. C. A. during the last year shows it worthy of the sup
port of the students, and there should be no trouble in raising the amount
necessary to carry on the work for the coming year.
