A bill recently introduced into the
state legislature provides for the cen
corship of questionable movies in the
interest of public morals. Farther
down it reads that places of learning
will be exempt from aforesaid censor
ship. Evidently universities are in
corruptible or else they are gone too
for already. At any rate, we're glad
we're here.

Bunkum Billie says he knew a bird
with burh nerves who was takin' a
shower one day, when a wag slipped
up behind, him and stuck a sharp
piece of ice on his neck and told him
his time had come. Comes a holler
and the guy shoves on a few pounds
heavier and spills a can of red paint
on the floor. The victim looked at
his feet and died from loss o' blood.

A young boy was suddenly deprived
of his father, and his mother wishing
to have him taken care of married her
deceased husband's father. The ques
tion arose as to the child's relation
ship to the new father, and it was de
cided that his mother, having married
her father-in-law, who was her son's
grandfather,., was., her son's grand
mother-in-law, thus making her second
husband ( her son's step-grandfather
in-law.

And it came to pass that a child
was born to the newly married couple
was figured to be the first child's
father, who. being at the same time
the first child's brother, caused the
belief to be spread that number one
was his own father, in which case he
would become his grandmother-in
law's first husband, by this time push
ing up poppies. Startled by the fact
that his insecure geneology made him
out a dead man, child number one
pulled up the family tree by the roots
and gave it to the slums for Christ
mas.

We see in today's D. P. A. that
Coach Seay is calling out the base

"By golly, I don't see where the
children got thoHe noses," declared the
startled old rooster as he watched
Madame Hen mothering a flock of
web-fret. "They're the first pug

since Noa'h flood." Ho continued to
view the brood with growing nlarm
"I'll swear, I must be an awl'ul goose,"
