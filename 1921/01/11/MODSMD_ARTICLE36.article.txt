# MALONEY RETURNS FROM VANCOUVER TRIP WITH RUGGERS
## 
### 
Coach W. H. Maloney returned from
British Columbia Saturday with the
rugby team and with arrival soccer
talk revived into a discussion of how
the team stands now that the quarter's
work has begun in interest. Coach
Maloney piloted the rugby squad
through a successful trip, and will
now devote most of his efforts toward
plugging up any holes that may be
present in the soccer team, in pre
paration for the next game.
An encouraging feature of the situa
tion as shapes up now is the fact
that every man who played on the
team last quarter, with the exception
of one, is back this year and ready to
resume his place. Peavy is the only
one who will not be on hand when
the roll is called before the big battle
next Saturday.
Freshman soccer, as far as contests
with other schools or colleges are
concerned, is no longer on the map.
The team's regular line-up has been
broken up by various causes, and prob
ably no more freshman games will
be played this season. The team
worked faithfully last quarter under
Captain Todd and Coach Malonov, and
made a good showing, considering the
little knowledge of the game most of
them had to begin with. Building a
soccer team out of absolutely raw ma
terial is not a job to be envied, and
the coaches made good work of their
greon material in the fall quarter.
