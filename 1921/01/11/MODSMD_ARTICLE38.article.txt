# CHARACTER WORK IS CLEVER FEATURE OF MASQUERS' PLAY
## 
### 
Character work prevails in "Trelaw
ney of the Wells" and is ably taken care
of by members of the cast. One of the
cleverest farce characters in the play is
that of Ferdinand Gadd, taken by Archie
Steele, '24. Ferdinand is, in his own
estimation, the idol of the public, and
excels in touching scenes of love with
his bride of the theater in the second
act. However, "Ferdy" is a "jealous
boy," and after indulging in a few
bracing drinks brings the scene to a
climax in a boisterous fight with Augus
tus Colpoys, who, according to the cus
tom of the theater, continuauolsy ad
dresses Avonia, the bride, in endearing
terms and arouses the fury of the jeal
ous Ferdinand.
Roy Riffle in his characterization of
Augustus Colpoys, also adds a touch of
the farcical to the play. "Gussy" is ex
ceedingly dramatic and excels in facial
expressions, which throw Mr. Ablett,
the house-boy, into fits of laughter, but
which are scorned by the people of the
theater.
These two are by no means the only
comedy parts in the play, as every part,
no matter how serious, has either a
touch of the ridiculous or the sublime
humor. For the play is rich throughout
in its humorous lines and incidents.
