## 
### 
Latest word on the preparations of
the class of *24, for the dance they
are to give Saturday night at Encina
Hall, seems to indicate that it will be
an affair well worth attending. Most
of the arrangements have been com
pleted.
The music will be furished by
Reynold's five-piece orchestra. The
dance will not be in the nature of a
jolly-up, but will be a straight pro
gram affair. The programs them
selves will be decorated in green and
white.
Tickets to the dance can be pro
cured at the Business Office in the
Administration Building, Wednesday,
betwoen the hours of 2 and 4 in the
afternoon. The admission |pri<ie is
$1.65. Those who do not get tickets
at the Business Office can procure
them from Burton Hard, Victor Clay
ton. Daniel Gage or Orion Clark, mem
bers of the entertainment committee
