# CALL TO HUMORISTS OF CAMPUS SOUNDED BY EDITOR FISHER
## 
### 
February 15 is the day! By that
date all campus razz artists must
turn in their contributions to Editor
Ross Fisher in order to be eligible for
the razz prices of the 1922 Quad.
Fisher is sounding the call to the
Foolish or Near-Foolish to wield their
Watermans and Underwoods in a rasyz
upon the Great or Near-Great. No
limitation is placed upon the nature
of the contributions. Anything from
the increase of tuition fees to the
earless fourth of the student body
will be considered by the prize award
board.
The only proviso stipulated by
Fisher is that a bona-fide imitation
of humor be maintained by the writer
or cartoonist. As to what degree of
humor will be required the editor is
silent, though rumor states that it
must be well above 2.75.
The prizes? Two leather bound
volumes of the 1922 Quad will be
awarded to the tape-breakers. One
volume will be given to the cleverest
series of cartoons razzing the campus
living groups, including not only the
fraternities and sororities but other
groups such as eating clubs. The
second prize will be awarded to the
best individual contribution either in
prose, verse or cartoon.
The editor has his lantern out for
new campus talent, the contributions
of first-year men and women receiv
ing the same consideration as those
signed by well-knowl humorists.
