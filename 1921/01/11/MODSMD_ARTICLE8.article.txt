# CARDINAL CORRECTS PUBLICITY REGARDING JORDAN'S LIFE STORY
## 
### 
Certain misstatements in regard to the
publication by The Cardinal t>f extracts
from the autobiography of David Starr
Jordan were corrected in a statement
issued today by Archie Binns, editor of
The Cardinal.
"In consideration of the courtesy
shown by Dr. Jordan in allowing The
Cardinal to print certain extracts from
his forthcoming autobiography," states
Binns, "the least I can do is to make
corrections in advertising which has
treated Â«the matter as a journalistic
scoop. In The Daily Palo Alto of Jan
uary 5 the news story which appeared
without my knowledge, but for which
I am nevertheless responsible as editor,
was of sufficiently inaccurate a nature
to give a false and undesirable impres
sion of the status of The Cardinal."
"The facts arc as follows: Such ex
tracts as we have been allowed to use
were given through pure courtesy, both
their nature and number being wholly
optional with the author, and having
nothing to do with such arrangements
which may be made with outside maga
zines.
"I am glad of the opportunity to make
this correction, since the unusual lib
erality of Dr. Jordan and -the best inter
ests concerned deserve every possible
consideration which shows the matter
in its correct light."
