## Ferrario is Elected Captain of Mission Basketballers; Powell to Use Same Lineup 
### 
Coach Bob Harmon will bring his
basketball tossers up from Santa Clara
tonight to play the varsity on Encina
court. From press reports emanating
from the Mission school they boast of a
fast organization. The squad is made
up mostly of men who arc prominent in
football, and includes Caesar Manelli,
captain of the 1920 football varsity, who
plays forward, Flaherty, Ferrario, Pigg
and several other athletes of note.

Ferrario was elected captain of the
Santa Clarans at a meeting held there
on Monday. Ferrario was right guard
on the football varsity and is a basket
tosser of some ability.

Coach Powell will start the same
lineup against Santa Clara that was so
successful in the opening contest with
the Olympic Club last Saturday night.
The entire squad of twenty-one men
have been going through their paces and
play is becoming faster with each suc
ceeding practice.
"Swede" Righter and Jimmy Davies
will do most of the offensive work
against the Missionites, aided by Bert
Mills, who put on a classy exhibition of
goal-shooting against the Olympics in
the first game. Captain Fred Adams
will play the standing guard position,
with Richmond at running guard.
With this combination working in its
usual form the Cardinal will be well
taken care of and should win from
Santa Clarans. However, the southern
team is noted for its fighting qualities'
and the contest will no doubt resolve
itself into a battle royal.
Preceding the varsity battle the Stan
ford freshmen will play the Palo Alto
High team. This is the first game of the
season for Seay's Babes and Stanford
supporters will be given an opportunity
to get a line on the strength of the
first-year team.
