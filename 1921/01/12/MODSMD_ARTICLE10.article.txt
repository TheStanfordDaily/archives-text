# FRESHMAN FIVE HAS FIRST GAME WITH PALO ALTO
## "Babes" Present Good Form For Early Season; Changes Made in Lineup for Game 
### 
The "Babe" quintet gets its first
real workout tonight at 7 p.m., when
they line up on the gymnasium court
against the five from Palo Alto high
school. Hard work on the part of
Coach Seay has put the first-year
squad in good shape for the fray to
night.

Last night Coach Seay put the men
through a stiff signal drill and used
all the men in their respective posi
tions. There was 110 scrimmage and
the entire practice was devoted to
perfecting the team work on the of
fensive. Last night was the first
time the reduced squad had had a
chance to play and all the members
got a chance to show what they had.
Jansen looks like the mainstay at
the center position. He has only been
out since the beginijing of this quar
ter and is not in such good condition
as some of the rest of the men, but
he is good at following the ball and a
handy man under the basket. His
work last night showed up well.
Melrose is the most consistent of
the candidates for tho forward posi
tions. He is accurate in the basket
shooting and fast with the ball, but
light for a college team. His clever
l'oot work gives him an advantage that
overcomes his lack of weight.
Mannocir has been changed from
center to standing guard. He is a
heavy man, and tall with long arms,
and makes a good man under the
basket for the long returns from the
end of the court.
Bragg is one of the most consistent
of the players, and is good at advanc
ing the ball. He is tall and a good
man on guarding also.
Probably all the men or at least the
greater part of the squad will be used
in the game tonight because it is the
policy of Coach Seay to try out all
the members and find out the com
binations that work the best. The
line-up is not certain for the contest
this evening, but the five who will
probably start are as follows:
Forwards, N. Granger and N. Mc-
Ilose; guards, Wittenberg, and Man
noccir; center, Jansen.
