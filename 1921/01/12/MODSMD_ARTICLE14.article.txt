## Artist Considered Unequaled In Voice and Choice of Songs: Ticket Sale Friday

artist has created more of a stir in
the music world than Louis Graveure,

ing, January 20. In the past two
years Graveure has made tremendous
strides and critics consider liira un
equaled in beauty of voice, method
of singing and choice of songs, among
the leading artist now appearing be
fore the public.
Graveure has an unusual degree of
power of visualizing the picture he
wishes to convey, and this is consider
ed one of the strongest assets of his
great success. On his last- appear
ance in San Francisco he was wel
comed as one of the few men who
have "come back," that is, he recover
ed his voice, more beautiful and re
sonant than ever, it is said, after
years of silence through illness. At
that time he demonstrated apparently
without effort, that he is really a great
baritone, endowed with large range,
wonderful tone qualities and dramatic
power, all of which have been culti
vated practically to the perfection of

art.
His songs represent almost every
kind of subject and emotion and
show the artist at home in every one,
the change from grave to gay being
made completely and quickly, as
though presented by different artists,
but with the corresponding transition
of vocal characteristics.
