# PRACTICAL ENTHUSIASM
## 
### 
Football has been erased from the sport calendar, and Stanford en
thusiasm should now be directed toward the basketball, baseball, tennis,
and track (earns. The past football season saw a considerable amount
of enthusiasm expended by the student body on the greatest of the ma
jor sports, and this enthusiasm should not be allowed to diminish dur
ing the next few months. It is in these four sports that Stanford must
come back after the football defeat at the hands of the Golden Bear.
Practical enthusiasms can be shown by the number of men who
turn out for the teams, and by the size of the crowds that attend the
contests. The basketball squad already has been selected by the coach,
and so enthusiasm can now be turned toward swelling' the crowds that
fill the gymnasium for the games. Basketball has always drawn good,
but track, tennis, and baseball have never been favored with especially
large crowds. Those who cannot qualify as candidates for the respec
tive teams or are unwilling to try can at least attend all of the games
on the schedules.
The number of men that turned out for track last year was the
smallest in years. The coach started out with a large list of prospective
candidates, but inside of a few days the squad mysteriously disappeared,
and only a handful of men remained. No coach can develop successful
teams without material, an if all of the sports on the calendar will be
favored with large squads of willing men who will stay with the "graft"
through the entire season, Stanford will have successful teams.
