be rated by educational institutions in

council therefore appointed a committee
of persons" known to have wide knowl
edge of Latin American educational
conditions to consider the question and
to recommend a procedure to American
higher institutions. Professor Martin
served as a member of this committee.
The other members were Professor W.
