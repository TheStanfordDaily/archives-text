So anxious was a San Francisco
man to get away from friend wife,
that when her case was called in the
divorce court, he took a front seat
to enjoy the procedure. Upon being
questioned by the judge as to the
reason of his appearance in the de
fault court, hubby replied that his
wife had ruined his bank account and
that he intended to have a ringside
seat when she started ruining his
character. Then the wiff called upon
her would-be-divorced husband for 1
substantiation of her evidence alleg
ing him to be a green-striped, ring
tailed monster of iniquity. But al
though hubby was willing to sit
tight while his lofty character was
dragged through the back lot, he re
fused to be a party to the act. And
because the loving pair then and
there engaged in a heated argument
concerning the validity of evidence
introduced, the judge caused them to
pay the penalty by refusing to grant
a divorce.

front page, "seventy six students dis
qualified for Autumn Quarter." Third
page, "Sixty-seven students quality for
degrees." Seems as though there are
various ways to qualify, and at pres
ent the nays have it.

Slufoot Sam says he's working on
a smokeless tobacco plant to meet
the emergency of the inevitable to
bacco prohibition. Says a man can
puff on a weed in the cover of his
hand, and fool the federal agants
under their noses. This story is
countered, however, bu current reports
that the aforesaid agents are putting
the ban on the clove industry. And
there goes Sluefoot's work for a nice
round one. Somethin' like <kickin'
the legs from under a big man so's
you can get at him.

Twelve men attacked the carriage
of a Spanish governor, and fired fifty
shots into the vehicle without touch
ing the old grandee... The news item
saws that three shots went through
the carriage and killed or injured as
many people... Two pills pierced the
cushions on which his Nibs sat. No
wonder Spain has ceased to be a
world power when a dozen of her citi
zens fail to hit a single man in four
and a sixth turns apiece.

N.B.—When traveling in Spain,
never feel safe unless you are the
target.

The back-to-the-farm movement has
been equalled by a general exodus
from sth Avenue, led my Mrs. Vandar
bilt, bound for a part of Avenue A,
the home of tenements, motor trucks,
and cobblestones. Whether the change
is a come-down or an uplift move
ment remains to be seen. No doubt
"slum at will" is the adopted slogan.

Now that the Engineering Building
is given over for the most part to
Econ and various other feminine and
masculine majors, ye cabbage-ed must
announce that hats should not be re
moved in the halls of any such buld-
Ing. Otherwise, out of politeness, the
host majors may be forced to act as
of they are not at home.
