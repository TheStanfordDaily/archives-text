# Junior Sorority Women Need Two Quad Pictures
## 
### 
With the end of sorority rushing for
the quarter, not only the opportunity
but the time for the taking of pictures
for the 1922 Quad is afforded to all
women on the Row. During the first
week of the quarter it was to be ex
pected that few sorority women would
report to Davey's, but with the close of
the rushing season the Quad manage
ment hopes that increased numbers will
make arrangements with the studio to
have their pictures taken.
As the work of the studio will be
light this week, the next few days will
be an opportune time in which to report
to Davey's. The number of pictures
that can be run on a page is strictly
limited, making it essential that all
women be photographed in the near
future if their pictures are included in
the Quad.
A mistaken impression has arisen re
garding the sorority pictures of juniors,
Editor Fisher advises. Pictures taken by
third-year women for the Junior Section
of the Quad cannot be used for the
sorority group picture. Junior sorority
women who had their pictures taken for
the Junior Section must report to
Davey's for a separate picture to be in
cluded in the group picture of the house
to which they belong.
