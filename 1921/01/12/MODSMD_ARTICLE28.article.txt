## 
### 
Once again tho Stanford Rugby
team has made a name for itself and
Stanford in international athletics.
Leaving here at the beginning of the
holidays the team arrived by boat at
Vancouver on Christmas Eve. Going
up there were very bad storms and
most of the men began to feel effects
of the ride. Nevertheless, the play
ers were ready for action the next
day. Odds were against them, not
only were the grounds slippery with
ud but this was the first time that
the entire team had played together
and with the facts that the team was
not in the best condition to play,
coupled with the sickness of the men,
the results obtained proves that
Stanford is a real leader in Rugby.
The first game played was with the
University of the District of Columbia.
The field was very muddy and the
rain stopped only for the short peri
od of the game after which it fell in
great sheets. The game was fast
throughout and although the Stanford
ites did not come out on the long
| end of the score their line was not
once crossed. The game ended 9-0
in favor of the Britishers, the scores
being made by field goals by Lou
Hunter, one of the finest kickers that
has ever been produced in Canada.
It is said that the game was witnessed
by 12,000 spectators and that the
Cardinal expenses were entirely paid
by this game.
The second and third games were
played with picked teams from Van
couver. They ended in a 3 to 0 and
, a 9 to 0 score in favor of Stanford,
1 respectively. All the scores were
made from field goals and during the
entire series of games the opponents
were out-classed. In the second game
Danny Carroll, captain of the team,
made a thrilling run through a broken
field. Mr. Rlaloney, coach of the team,
said that it was one of the best
pieces of work that he had ever seen.
The Vancouver World, one of
Canada's largest newspapers, has of
fered a large loving cup for the win
ner of the international Rugby cham
pionship. This is a league composed
of California, Washington, and Stan-
I ford. The winner of this league must
play the University of the District of
Columbia at Vancouver, and to re
tain the cup the same team must win

| will undoubtedly help increase the in
i terest in the game and also help inter
collegiate relations between the Amer
ican and the Canadian Universities.
The pleasant feature about the trip
was the cordial manner in which the
team was treated. The men were
taken directly to the best homes in
Vancouver and it was seen to that all
their wants were cared for. Many
dances and parties were given in their
honor and Mr. Maloney stated that he
had never been better treated than
le and his men. were on this trip.

Danny Carroll, captain of the team,
made a thrilling run through a broken
field. Mr. Rlaloney, coach of the team,
said that it was one of the best

Leaving here at the beginning of the
holidays the team arrived by boat at
Vancouver on Christmas Eve. Going

most of the men began to feel effects
of the ride. Nevertheless, the play
ers were ready for action the next
day. Odds were against them, not
only were the grounds slippery with
ud but this was the first time that
the entire team had played together
and with the facts that the team was
not in the best condition to play,
coupled with the sickness of the men,
the results obtained proves that
