# CARDINAL SOCCER TEAM TO MEET OLYMPIC CLUB
## Game Saturday Will Probably Decide Championship of the San Francisco League 
### 
Monday was the first time this quarter
that the soccer squad has held practice
uqder the watchful eye of Coach Ma
loney, the second practice being held
today. These workouts have given him
a chance to look the men over and see
how his machine is working preparatory
to the next contest. With more clear,
cold, snappy weather, good workouts
will do a good deal towards patting the
team in the best of shape.
On Saturday the team will travel up
to San Francisco in an endeavor to
show the Olympic team the best brand
of soccer on the coast, and, incidentally,
win the game and make that resting
place on top of the league a little more
comfortable. As it is now, a sturdy push
up from those underneath would suffice
to make the league leadership tremble
[ in the balance. Especially is this true
if the Olympics are the ones that do
the pushing. They are hanging on to
second place with the grip of grim
death, and in addition are making such
a strong bid for place number one as to
cause the Cardinal backers some appre
hension.
Statistics, which have the reputation
for never telling untruths, show that
Stanford leads the clubmen by three
points. If Coach Maloney's soccerites
can win this next game it is about as
sure as things are made that the, close
of the season will find them on top by
a comfortalile margin, for the rest of
the games on the Cardinal schedule are
with teams which are not strong enough
to cause much trouble. On the other
hand, a defeat handed out by the Olym
pics would throw the whole issue in
doubt, as their next game is with Cali
fornia. They have beaten California be
fore and should be able to do it again.
Two victories in a row like this would
mean that San Francisco, and not Stan
ford, would be riding the crest of the
soccer wave. At any rate, next Saturday
will tell the tale.
