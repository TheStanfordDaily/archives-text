# Handball Tryouts Are Scheduled For Tomorrow
## 
### 
Handball tryouls will be held to
morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock on the
Peninsula Club court, Forest street,
Palo Alto. Two doubles teams and
a single player will be selected to play
against the University of California
handball artists.
Varsity and freshman doubles
teams will be chosen, and the best
individual player for the singles con
test will be picked regardless of class
The reason for playing tryouts on
the Peninsula Club court is that it is
the only box court available, and as
the games with the Blue and Gold
teams will be played on a neutral
box court, the coach is using this
court to make the players familiar
with the box type.
Considerable interest is being shown
in handball both at Stanford and at
California. The popularity of the
sport at Berkeley is shown by the ad
ditions of four new courts to the
equipment of that institution.
The following men are requested to
be on hand for the tryouts: A. Chis
holm, C. E. llutter, J. B. Sansone, H.
M. Clark, H. English, L. W. Hollings
worth, S. A. Steindorf, M. Cohen, F.
Koba, A. C. Lowenstein, N. L. Welch,
W. D. Evans, and A. Cohen.
