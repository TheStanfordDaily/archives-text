# FUNCTION OF CEREBRUM SUBJECT OF FRANZ TALK
## Head of Government Insanity Work Lectures; Describes Cures of Mentally Injured 
### 
Last night at the Little Theater Dr.
Shepherd Franz, who has charge of the
Government Hospital for the Insane at
Washington and is a professor at George
Washington University, lectured on the
re-education of paralytfcs. Dr. Franz is
one of the hest-posted men in the world
on the subject of localization of func
tion in the. cerebrum, and until he made
his successful experiments on paralytic
cases of from four to twelve years'
standing the medical world had con
cluded that no case more than two years
old was possible to be cured.
"Disability to function," said Dr.
Franz, "is caused by parts of the brain
being destroyed either by a wound be
ing received on the motor area or by
internal hemorrhage of a blood vessel
of the brain. T have been able to cure
cases of so-called apoplexy in as short
a time as seven weeks by teaching the
patient to gradually exercise the useless
part until he became able to use it in a
normal manner. At first the movements
are made in a random and jerky man
ner, but gradually the patient becomes
able to make an individual movement
normally. Organized motion is the final
step towards complete rehabilitation and
is the result of long and careful practice.
"Over two million of the people of
the United States are misfits and must
be readapted to some other work for
which they are more suited; therefore
this problem should be of great concern
to the thinking men and women of the
country."
The lecture was illustrated by many
interesting charts and pictures showing
the improvement of individual cases
both in functional and psychotic tasks.
