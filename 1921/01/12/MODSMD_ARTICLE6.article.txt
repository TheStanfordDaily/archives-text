# NEW BOOKS FEATURE EARLY EXPLORATION
## 
### 
The romance of exploration and ad
venture is the dominating note.â€žin the
collections of newly-acquired hooks
which the Library presents this week.
The Vestiges of Old Madras, one of the
Indian Records Scries, compiled by H.
Davison Lore, royal engineer, is
crammed with old maps, diagrams and
illustrations. The Voyages of Stavor
inus, a three-volume account of the
Dutch colonization in India and the
Cape of Good Hope, is written in archaic
English, but is in good readable black
face type.
Asiatio Studies, by Sir Alfred C.
Lyall, 1899, deals with the situation be
fore the East was opened to modern
commerce. The data cjjjbodied in these
reports is in interesting contrast to that
in the latest edition of Pacific Ports
Trade Manual, which "elbows them.
Metalliferous Deposits of Coornwidl, by
Herroid; Heredity of Acquired Charac
teristics in Plants, by G. Ilenslow, and
The History of France to 1919, by
Durey, represent work in other fields.
The note of other days and other
times is maintained in the books col
lected for the English Department, how
ever. Seven old, brown and battered
volumes of Theobald's Shakespeare,
bearing the publisher's date of
MDCCXXJftII, comprise this division
of the collection.
