# PRESENT TALKS TO CHAMBER ON EUROPEAN RELIEF
## Three and One-half Million Children Must be Fed by American Charity Each Day 
### 
"European Relief in Relation to Child
Welfare" is the subject which President
Wilbur discussed in his speech before
the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
at a luncheon held this noon. President
Wilbur is an honorary member of the
body, having been elected several years
ago. His address deals with the work
which Herbert Hoover is so success
fully carrying on in regard to the child
feeding question in Central Europe.
President Wilbur's speech was as fol
lows :
"For a nupiber of years the principal
subject before the people of the United
States has been that of international re
lations. At no time in our history have
events outside of America played such a
large part in our daily lives and daily
thought. The most outstanding features
of these international relations have

been our participation in the great war
and our recent election which revolved
largely around the final settlement of
that contest. Just as it took a number
of years to build up the conditions favor
able to the occurrence of the war, so we
must go through a long period of re
cuperation before we can approach those
conditions of civilization with which we
were formerly familiar. We are as
deeply concerned today in the welfare
of the people of Central Europe as we
were in the outcome of the contests
upon the battlefield. While this nation
will receive the greatest of credit be
cause its army and navy gave the final,
blows that led to victory, there is no
doubt that the historian of the future
will lay greater stress upon our contri
butions of food and service to Europe
during and after the war.
The world has become so small with
the development of transportation and
communication and our world economic
structure is so interwoven that we are
all deeply concerned by everything that
leads to disorganization, financial, crop
or other failure elsewhere. Our contri
butions to Belgium and Northern
France during the war period and the
work of the American Relief Adminis
tration immediately following the war
throughout Central Europe were not
only invaluable to these countries and
to their future, but also of the greatest
importance to us. With the passage of
time and the return to peace-time activi
ties, in spite of the decrease in produc
tion of all sorts, there has been a suffi
cient lowering of standards of living so
that Europe has been able to provide
some sort of care for some seven and
a half millions of its war orphans, but
has been, unable to provide even a satis
factory minimum of food for some three
and a half million others. Upon these
eleven million orphans depends the
future of Europe. Tf these grow up
weak in body, deficient in spirit, defec
tive in education, we can look forward
to a continuation of those terrible mental
states affecting large groups which have
brought about such disasters to civiliza
tion as we can now sec in Russia.
"The problem before the American
people is to feed once a day to three
and a half million children a-nical mfidc
up of flour, milk, beans, rice, fats, sugar
and cocoa, with a total food value equal
to that of the ordinary American break
fast. The actual cost of this food will
be about $23,000,000. There must, in
addition, be some $10,000,000 for cloth
ing, medical supplies and other relief
through the Red Cross and associated
agencies. The management of the thou
sands of kitchens and the provision of
this food to the children is in the hands
of 100,000 Europeans, the principal busi
ness men in each community as leaders,
with some forty Americans supervising
the distribution to sec that everything is
handled on an absolutely even and
American basis. The organization of the
business men and charitable women in
these various communities lays the basis
for the development of a community
sentiment that will be able to deal per
manently with this question as soon as
the local crops supply sufficient food.
You can picture the problem before the
business men of each community when
you see that they must get together a
staff personnel, supply the equipment,
get together means of transport, rent
kitchens, perfect the associated medical
service, and so on. The actual cost for
each child for food and clothing is
three dollars per month. Of course
these purchases are made on an enor
mous scale and every economy is ob
tained. Our part in the three dollars
per month is practically one dollar per
month for the food listed above sent
from America and the expense of super
vision. There is a 2y 2 per cent overhead.
"Starvation under civilized conditions
shows its hand by a marked increase in
the death rate. Communities that may
appear from casual observation to be
healthy and sound show upon careful
study that the sick and starving children
are in the homes, hospitals and elsewhere
or in the morgues, are victims of tuber
culosis, contagious or other diseases.
Children become particularly susceptible
to diseases if the amount of fat which
they are given is greatly reduced. Per
haps the best evidence of the success of
the feeding of children is the following
statement made by the Minister of
Health of the Polish government: 'In
the year and a half during which the
American Relief Administration has
been in operation, the death rate among
the children from one to fifteen years of
age has decreased 50 per cent.'
"Not only as a matter of charity and
Christianity, but for the sake of the
welfare of democracy and for the pro
tection of our own economic structure
and our own civil life, we must be sure
that these children in Europe grow up as
sound and well as they can under the
conditions that follow in the wake of
war. One can readily imagine what
these conditions must be in certain dis
tricts, for instance, near Riga, where
the country has been fought over seven
times in five years.
"America's part in this program may
seem large to us, particularly at this
time, when we are beginning to pay foi
the war in many different ways, bu f
twenty-five cents apiece is not too much
for every American citizen to pay in
the form of insurance against a chaotic
and Red Europe. It is the path of wis
dom for us to do what we can to give
Europe her foothold back to normal
life, and I think we can all agree with
Mr. Hoover in his noble statement when
he says: 'To me it is a glory to the
United States that three and a half
million hungry waifs should sit every
day at our table, for I would rather
have the American flag implanted in
the hearts of the children of Europe
than flying from any citadel of vic
tory.' "

"European Relief in Relation to Child
Welfare" is the subject which President
Wilbur discussed in his speech before
the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
at a luncheon held this noon. President
Wilbur is an honorary member of the
body, having been elected several years
ago. His address deals with the work
which Herbert Hoover is so success
fully carrying on in regard to the child
feeding question in Central Europe.
President Wilbur's speech was as fol
lows :
"For a nupiber of years the principal
subject before the people of the United
States has been that of international re
lations. At no time in our history have
events outside of America played such a
large part in our daily lives and daily
thought. The most outstanding features
of these international relations have

been our participation in the great war
and our recent election which revolved
largely around the final settlement of
that contest. Just as it took a number
of years to build up the conditions favor
able to the occurrence of the war, so we
must go through a long period of re
cuperation before we can approach those
conditions of civilization with which we
were formerly familiar. We are as
deeply concerned today in the welfare
of the people of Central Europe as we
were in the outcome of the contests
upon the battlefield. While this nation
will receive the greatest of credit be
cause its army and navy gave the final,
blows that led to victory, there is no
doubt that the historian of the future
will lay greater stress upon our contri
butions of food and service to Europe
during and after the war.
The world has become so small with
the development of transportation and
communication and our world economic
structure is so interwoven that we are
all deeply concerned by everything that
leads to disorganization, financial, crop
or other failure elsewhere. Our contri
butions to Belgium and Northern
France during the war period and the
work of the American Relief Adminis
tration immediately following the war
throughout Central Europe were not
only invaluable to these countries and
to their future, but also of the greatest
importance to us. With the passage of
time and the return to peace-time activi
ties, in spite of the decrease in produc
tion of all sorts, there has been a suffi
cient lowering of standards of living so
that Europe has been able to provide
some sort of care for some seven and
a half millions of its war orphans, but
has been, unable to provide even a satis
factory minimum of food for some three
and a half million others. Upon these
eleven million orphans depends the
future of Europe. Tf these grow up
weak in body, deficient in spirit, defec
tive in education, we can look forward
to a continuation of those terrible mental
states affecting large groups which have
brought about such disasters to civiliza
tion as we can now sec in Russia.
"The problem before the American
people is to feed once a day to three
and a half million children a-nical mfidc
up of flour, milk, beans, rice, fats, sugar
and cocoa, with a total food value equal
to that of the ordinary American break
fast. The actual cost of this food will
be about $23,000,000. There must, in
addition, be some $10,000,000 for cloth
ing, medical supplies and other relief
through the Red Cross and associated
agencies. The management of the thou
sands of kitchens and the provision of
this food to the children is in the hands
of 100,000 Europeans, the principal busi
ness men in each community as leaders,
with some forty Americans supervising
the distribution to sec that everything is
handled on an absolutely even and
American basis. The organization of the
business men and charitable women in
these various communities lays the basis
for the development of a community
sentiment that will be able to deal per
manently with this question as soon as
the local crops supply sufficient food.
You can picture the problem before the
business men of each community when
you see that they must get together a
staff personnel, supply the equipment,
get together means of transport, rent
kitchens, perfect the associated medical
service, and so on. The actual cost for
each child for food and clothing is
three dollars per month. Of course
these purchases are made on an enor
mous scale and every economy is ob
tained. Our part in the three dollars
per month is practically one dollar per
month for the food listed above sent
from America and the expense of super
vision. There is a 2y 2 per cent overhead.
"Starvation under civilized conditions
shows its hand by a marked increase in
the death rate. Communities that may
appear from casual observation to be
healthy and sound show upon careful
study that the sick and starving children
are in the homes, hospitals and elsewhere
or in the morgues, are victims of tuber
culosis, contagious or other diseases.
Children become particularly susceptible
to diseases if the amount of fat which
they are given is greatly reduced. Per
haps the best evidence of the success of
the feeding of children is the following
statement made by the Minister of
Health of the Polish government: 'In
the year and a half during which the
American Relief Administration has
been in operation, the death rate among
the children from one to fifteen years of
age has decreased 50 per cent.'
"Not only as a matter of charity and
Christianity, but for the sake of the
welfare of democracy and for the pro
tection of our own economic structure
and our own civil life, we must be sure
that these children in Europe grow up as
sound and well as they can under the
conditions that follow in the wake of
war. One can readily imagine what
these conditions must be in certain dis
tricts, for instance, near Riga, where
the country has been fought over seven
times in five years.
"America's part in this program may
seem large to us, particularly at this
time, when we are beginning to pay foi
the war in many different ways, bu f
twenty-five cents apiece is not too much
for every American citizen to pay in
the form of insurance against a chaotic
and Red Europe. It is the path of wis
dom for us to do what we can to give
Europe her foothold back to normal
life, and I think we can all agree with
Mr. Hoover in his noble statement when
he says: 'To me it is a glory to the

and Red Europe. It is the path of wis
dom for us to do what we can to give
Europe her foothold back to normal
life, and I think we can all agree with
Mr. Hoover in his noble statement when
he says: 'To me it is a glory to the
United States that three and a half
million hungry waifs should sit every
day at our table, for I would rather
have the American flag implanted in
the hearts of the children of Europe
than flying from any citadel of vic

"European Relief in Relation to Child
Welfare" is the subject which President
Wilbur discussed in his speech before
the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
at a luncheon held this noon. President
Wilbur is an honorary member of the
body, having been elected several years
ago. His address deals with the work
which Herbert Hoover is so success
fully carrying on in regard to the child
feeding question in Central Europe.
President Wilbur's speech was as fol
lows :
"For a nupiber of years the principal
subject before the people of the United
States has been that of international re
lations. At no time in our history have
events outside of America played such a
large part in our daily lives and daily
thought. The most outstanding features
of these international relations have

been our participation in the great war
and our recent election which revolved
largely around the final settlement of
that contest. Just as it took a number
of years to build up the conditions favor
able to the occurrence of the war, so we
must go through a long period of re
cuperation before we can approach those
conditions of civilization with which we
were formerly familiar. We are as
deeply concerned today in the welfare
of the people of Central Europe as we
were in the outcome of the contests
upon the battlefield. While this nation
will receive the greatest of credit be
cause its army and navy gave the final,
blows that led to victory, there is no
doubt that the historian of the future
will lay greater stress upon our contri
butions of food and service to Europe
during and after the war.
The world has become so small with
the development of transportation and
communication and our world economic
structure is so interwoven that we are
all deeply concerned by everything that
leads to disorganization, financial, crop
or other failure elsewhere. Our contri
butions to Belgium and Northern
France during the war period and the
work of the American Relief Adminis
tration immediately following the war
throughout Central Europe were not
only invaluable to these countries and
to their future, but also of the greatest
importance to us. With the passage of
time and the return to peace-time activi
ties, in spite of the decrease in produc
tion of all sorts, there has been a suffi
cient lowering of standards of living so
that Europe has been able to provide
some sort of care for some seven and
a half millions of its war orphans, but
has been, unable to provide even a satis
factory minimum of food for some three
and a half million others. Upon these
eleven million orphans depends the
future of Europe. Tf these grow up
weak in body, deficient in spirit, defec
tive in education, we can look forward
to a continuation of those terrible mental
states affecting large groups which have
brought about such disasters to civiliza
tion as we can now sec in Russia.
"The problem before the American
people is to feed once a day to three
and a half million children a-nical mfidc
up of flour, milk, beans, rice, fats, sugar
and cocoa, with a total food value equal
to that of the ordinary American break
fast. The actual cost of this food will
be about $23,000,000. There must, in
addition, be some $10,000,000 for cloth
ing, medical supplies and other relief
through the Red Cross and associated
agencies. The management of the thou
sands of kitchens and the provision of
this food to the children is in the hands
of 100,000 Europeans, the principal busi
ness men in each community as leaders,
with some forty Americans supervising
the distribution to sec that everything is
handled on an absolutely even and
American basis. The organization of the
business men and charitable women in
these various communities lays the basis
for the development of a community
sentiment that will be able to deal per
manently with this question as soon as
the local crops supply sufficient food.
You can picture the problem before the
business men of each community when
you see that they must get together a
staff personnel, supply the equipment,
get together means of transport, rent
kitchens, perfect the associated medical
service, and so on. The actual cost for
each child for food and clothing is
three dollars per month. Of course
these purchases are made on an enor
mous scale and every economy is ob
tained. Our part in the three dollars
per month is practically one dollar per
month for the food listed above sent
from America and the expense of super
vision. There is a 2y 2 per cent overhead.
"Starvation under civilized conditions
shows its hand by a marked increase in
the death rate. Communities that may
appear from casual observation to be
healthy and sound show upon careful
study that the sick and starving children
are in the homes, hospitals and elsewhere
or in the morgues, are victims of tuber
culosis, contagious or other diseases.
Children become particularly susceptible
to diseases if the amount of fat which
they are given is greatly reduced. Per
haps the best evidence of the success of
the feeding of children is the following
statement made by the Minister of
Health of the Polish government: 'In
the year and a half during which the
American Relief Administration has
been in operation, the death rate among
the children from one to fifteen years of
age has decreased 50 per cent.'
"Not only as a matter of charity and
Christianity, but for the sake of the
welfare of democracy and for the pro
tection of our own economic structure
and our own civil life, we must be sure
that these children in Europe grow up as
sound and well as they can under the
conditions that follow in the wake of
war. One can readily imagine what
these conditions must be in certain dis
tricts, for instance, near Riga, where
the country has been fought over seven
times in five years.
"America's part in this program may
seem large to us, particularly at this
time, when we are beginning to pay foi
the war in many different ways, bu f
twenty-five cents apiece is not too much
for every American citizen to pay in
the form of insurance against a chaotic
and Red Europe. It is the path of wis
dom for us to do what we can to give
Europe her foothold back to normal
life, and I think we can all agree with
Mr. Hoover in his noble statement when
