# PRE-WAR PRICES ARE FEATURE OF HEALY CONCERT
## Effort Is Now Being Made to "Popularize" Programs; Sale Starts on January 14 
### 
I In presenting Louis Graveure, the
notc\baritone, in the Assembly Hall on
Thursday evening, January 20, Frank
W Healy will revert to pfe-war prices.
The tickets for this concert will be at
the popular prices of $1 and $1.50.
These prices are Mr. Healy's original
pre-war prices, the admission to his
concerts for some time having been $2.
At that price lie has always been able
to get a good house for his artists, but
it has been largely composed of people
of the peninsnla and a few students.
Mr. Healy, however, wants to "popu
larize" these concerts and make them
possible to all the students. To do this
he has lowered his prices and is willing
that the students take advantage of it.
The Healy concerts will give everyone
an opportunity to hear the best artists
on the concert stage today at a reason
able price. The $1.50 seats will be
nearer the center of the house, but as
at a concert there is little choice of
seats, the ones at $1 will also be desir
able. The sale of seats will start Mon
day, January 14.
In commenting on Gravcitre's recent
appearance in Detroit, one of the lead
ing critics wrote:
"If there is a more satisfactory con
cert baritone now appearing before the
public than Louis Graveure, lie has not
included Detroit in his itinerary. Mr.
Graveure's visits to Detroit are always
looked forward to with keen anticipa
tion, and last evening he filled Orchestra
| Hall to capacity. It was the first time
' the great Belgian baritone ever sang in
Detroit under such ideal conditions, and
it is doubtful if he ever appeared to
I greater advantage. He was in splendid
voice, his program was selected with
al lthe care Mr. Graveure usually be
stows on this part of his work, and the
result was completely satisfactory in
! every sense of the word. Mr. Graveure's
voice is not of the robust type, hut is
! chiefly distinguished for its velvety
■ softness and resonance. Added to this the
| power of bringing out all the dramatic
1 intensity, thP*9*wetness, the pathos, the
