# NESTORIA WILL MEET MISSIONITES TONIGHT AT LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
The Nestoria-Santa Clara debate will
be held in the Little Theater tonight
at a joint meeting of Nestoria and
Euplironia societies. Nestoria expects
to receive closer competition from the
Santa Clara men than the basketeers did
last night on the Encina court, and have
been working hard in preparation for
the contest.

Phi and member of his class team and
active in club debating, heads the Nes
toria trio. The other members are Mar
tin DeVries, '21, a former member of
the University of Montana forensic
squad, and Victor Cappa, '23, secretary
of NeStoria. Cappa formerly attended
SÂ»inta Clara, and for that reason is well
prepared to meet the opposing team's
style of attack.
Nestoria has the negative on the ques
tion qf restriction of immigration. This
is the first of a series of intercollegiate
society debates planned by the society
to develop debating material.

Clara debate, Professor Payson J.
