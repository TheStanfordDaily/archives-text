Referee, Glenn.
Santa Clara's varsity quintet, Manelli,
Ferarrio, and all, fell before the on
slaughts of Coach Powell's aggregation
oi basket tossers last night in Encina
Gymnasium. The score was 28 to 13.
I lie game started with a bang. Logan,
Santa Clara forward, scored the first
goal two minutes after play started. A
couple of technical fouls gave them
two more counts, and a third basket
by Manelli made the total six points
before Stanford got started. Santa
Clara meanwhile was playing a pretty
defensive game. Righter and Mills soot*
fathomed the Santa Clara style of play
and made the count 6 to 4. Then the
battle started. Two personal fouls
which were converted by Davies tied
the score.
From this point on Stanford grad
ually forged ahead. The score at half
time was 18 to 8 in favor of Stanford
In the second half Santa Clara tired
badly and they scored but five points,
while Stanford adde/f ten more, making
the final score 28 to 13.
Both teams were powerful in defense.
Freddie Adams, playing standing
guard, kept the Stanford goal well
blocked and but .four field goals were
made by the Mission team. The Cardinal
varsity kept the play in Santa Clara
territory throughout most of the game.
Eleven field goals were chalked up by
the Stanford players.
Powell's men also led in the matter
of conversions. Each team had eleven
free tosses, Stanford converting si>-
while Santa Clara was successful in but
five.
Righter and Mills were even in the
number of points Scored, each con
tributing four field goals for a total of
eight points. Richmond again won the
plaudits of the spectators with a couple
of fancy shots from midcourt.
Caesar Manelli was the whole works
for the Harmonites. He made seven of
their thirteen points. Logan, 4he other
forward, made the remaining six.
