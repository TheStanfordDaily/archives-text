# A 						MISCONCEPTION

### 
It seems to be a recognized fact that material progress within a
University cannot go on without financial aid from alumni or other
interested persons. Eastern institutions depend largely on their alumni
for contributions with which to establish new departments, create en
dowments, scholarships, and undertake building programs, and as a
rule, the alumni never fail when the need is put up to them. Here at
Stanford, where there is a great need for money to expand in the way
of creating new departments, making salary increases and constructing
new buildings such as the Memorial Building, the Football Stadium,
and the Dormitories, the argument is always made by the skeptical that
the alumni body from Stanford is too small, and that the University is
too young to have a group of alumni upon which to depend for financial
aid. The idea is prevalent that a sufficient number of Stanford alumni
have not had time to become wealthy enough to contribute money to
their Alma Mater, and the alumni themselves strongly believe this, be
cause it is the argument they have always heard. Consequently, the en
terprises that the University has undertaken have been subscribed to
by a very small proportion of the alumni body, while the rest believe
that the University cannot rightfully call upon them for financial aid,
because they have not had time to become rich.
This idea is entirely erroneous. The burden should be borne by
every single man or woman who ever attended the University, and they
should consider it their duty, as well as their privilege, to support the
University regardless of their financial rating or the number of years
intervening since graduation. This is the idea that is ingrained into the
minds of the students and alumni of the Eastern institutions, and that
is the re'ason why the subscription lists are always large.
If the present Stanford students can grasp the idea that their duty
and interest in Stanford does not cease with their graduation or depart
ure from the University, and that they are liable to be called upon for
aid at any time and are expected to reply, then Stanford enterprises
will have a better chance for success in the future.
