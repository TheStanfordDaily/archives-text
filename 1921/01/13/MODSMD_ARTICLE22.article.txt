## 
### 
The work of furthering the interests
of the women students at Stanford
nas been in the handr of Miss Harri
ett Bradford for the last N four and a
half years. In her position as Dean
of Women Miss Bradford, more than
any one In the University, has had
actual rcntrol of the destinies of the
"500 "
Miss Bradford was born in San
Francisco in 1893. She received her
first education in the public element
ary schools of the city and is a gra
uaie of Lowell High School. She
then went east to college and receiv
ed her A.B. at liryn Mawr in 1915.
Alter graduating from college she
returned to California and took a po
sition as secretary of Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst. This position required her
residence at the wonderful Hearst
home in the hills back of Oakland,
until June, 1916.
At this time she resigned the po
sition as a secretary and attended the
summer session at California as a
visiting student until called to Stan
ford in August of that year to assume
the position of Dean of Women.
Miss Bradford has always been in
terested in the work of a deanship and
her work in college was with this end
in view d3ip.ce the pessimisti': advice
of some of her lrlends as to the long
hard road ahead before such a posi
tion as she now holds would be a
possibility. With the idea of eventu
ally becoming a dean, Miss Bradford

intended to take her master's degree
but desired to do some active work
first. Since that time she has been
so interested in her field of endeavor
that she has been unable to give the
time required to getting an f.dvanced
degree but hopes eventually to con
tinue her study. She r..')'nves that a
master's degree is practically an es
sential to an efficient and complete
handling of the work of a dean of
women of a college.
The main problem at the time Miss
Bradford took up the work at Stan
ford was housing the women. The
first years of the stay here were given
over to the solution of this important
question in life of the women stu
dents, and she ib directly responsible
for its practically successful workout.
This problem solved for all prac
tical purposes, she turned her atten
tion to the academic side of life here.
In this endeavor she has been speci
ally interested in the studies pursued
by the women students and the prac
tical value of the work here in life
after graduation. She has been try
ing to determine the real purpose of
the women here and if possible to
make them realize the extent of the
opportunities that are within their
grasp.
Miss Bradford during her entire
four and a half years at Stanford has
endeavored to make women's activi
ties a pleasure and a profit to them
and to make the "500" an important
cog in the wheels of student activity.

The work of furthering the interests
of the women students at Stanford
nas been in the handr of Miss Harri
ett Bradford for the last N four and a
half years. In her position as Dean
of Women Miss Bradford, more than
any one In the University, has had
actual rcntrol of the destinies of the
"500 "
Miss Bradford was born in San
Francisco in 1893. She received her
first education in the public element
ary schools of the city and is a gra
uaie of Lowell High School. She
then went east to college and receiv
ed her A.B. at liryn Mawr in 1915.
Alter graduating from college she
returned to California and took a po
sition as secretary of Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst. This position required her
residence at the wonderful Hearst
home in the hills back of Oakland,
until June, 1916.
At this time she resigned the po
sition as a secretary and attended the
summer session at California as a
visiting student until called to Stan
ford in August of that year to assume
the position of Dean of Women.
Miss Bradford has always been in
terested in the work of a deanship and
her work in college was with this end
in view d3ip.ce the pessimisti': advice
of some of her lrlends as to the long
hard road ahead before such a posi
tion as she now holds would be a
possibility. With the idea of eventu
ally becoming a dean, Miss Bradford

intended to take her master's degree
but desired to do some active work
first. Since that time she has been
so interested in her field of endeavor
that she has been unable to give the
time required to getting an f.dvanced
degree but hopes eventually to con
tinue her study. She r..')'nves that a
master's degree is practically an es
sential to an efficient and complete
handling of the work of a dean of
women of a college.
The main problem at the time Miss
Bradford took up the work at Stan
ford was housing the women. The
first years of the stay here were given
over to the solution of this important
question in life of the women stu
dents, and she ib directly responsible
for its practically successful workout.
This problem solved for all prac
tical purposes, she turned her atten
tion to the academic side of life here.
In this endeavor she has been speci
ally interested in the studies pursued
by the women students and the prac
tical value of the work here in life
after graduation. She has been try
ing to determine the real purpose of
the women here and if possible to
make them realize the extent of the
opportunities that are within their
grasp.
Miss Bradford during her entire
four and a half years at Stanford has
endeavored to make women's activi
ties a pleasure and a profit to them
and to make the "500" an important
cog in the wheels of student activity.
