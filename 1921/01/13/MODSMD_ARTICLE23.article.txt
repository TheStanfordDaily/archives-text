There's an old fairy-tale with a
poem in it that begins, "Today we
brew, tomorrow we bake," etc. Well,
if somebody doesn't get busy and push
Mr. Volstead J. Act off the statutes,
there'll never be any tomorrow in the
home of yours, truly.

Doggone it, if somebody wants to
write poetry, he ought to make that
little jingle go something like this—
Today we brew.
Tomorrow we drink,
But we'll sure cut it out
Sometime, we don't think.

Brandy Bill, Sherry Sam, and
Whisky Willie plead guilty to this
one—
Little Mister Volstead
Has come to cur house to stay;
To snoop and sneak and steal around,
And keep the booze away.
You'll find him in the attic,
You'll find him on the stair,
in tact you'll find this Volstead bum
Darn near anywhere.
He watches in the morning
He watches us at night
There ain't a chance with him around
Of ever gettin' tight.
He sniffs at all the bottles,
And searches 'round at will
Ahopin' that he'll catch us
With a little moonshine still.
We're layin' fer this bird, all right
To qreet him with a clout;
We'll get you Mister Volstead
If you don't watch out.

Gambler George has aces up and
decided to throw away the little pair,
figuring ho had a better chance to
catch threes than a filly. He caught
the other two little ones.
"By Golly," he remarked "This hand
must be the Miraculous Pitcher."
Aw go on, he must have picked up
his discard.
