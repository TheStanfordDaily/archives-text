# Water Polo Practice Begins This Afternoon
## 
### 
Water polo will he the chief feature
of the swimming tank in Encina gym
for the next few weeks. The varsity
swimming team is considerably weak
ened by the loss of several sprint swim
mers due to the proverbial "faculty axe"
and to injuries of some of the men.
The water polo men will practice
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, and
Coach Erny Brandsten will try to get
them into shape soon for some games
with the neighboring high school teams.
Tlie trip of the aquatic squad to the
South during the spring vacation de
pends on the amount of material that
turns out for the various swimming
events.
