# NEW HISTORY OF EDUCATION TEXT PUBLISHED BY DR. CUBBERLEY
## Practical Volume Considers Subject As Phase of Civilization 
### 
Dr. El wood P. Cubberley, head of the
Department of Education at Stanford,
has just published, through the Hough
ton-Mifflin Company, "The History of
Education," an 850-page volume cover
ing the development of educational prac
tice and progress in the world from a
different angle than that of any previous
work. Accompanying this book is a
companion volume, "Readings in the
History of Education," which, in 684
pages, offers a collection of sources and
readings illustrating the development of
educational practice, theory, and organ
ization, supplementary to the text of
the "History."
The character of Professor Cubber
ley's new "History" is indicated by the
sub-title of the volume, "Educational
Practices and Progress Considered as a
Phase of the Development and Spread
of Western Civilization," and by an
excerpt from his preface in which he
says:
"I have not tried to prepare another
history of educational theories. Of such
we already have a sufficient number. In
stead, I have tried to prepare a history
of the progress and practice and organ
ization of education itself, and to give
to such a history its proper setting as
a phase of the history of the develop
ment and spread of our Western civiliza
tion, I have especially tried to present
sucli a picture of the rise, struggle for
existence, growth, and recent great ex
pansion of the idea of the improvability
of the race and the elevation and eman
cipation of the individual through edu
cation as would be most illuminating
and useful to students of the subject.
To this end I have traced the great for
ward steps in the emancipation of the
intellect of man. and the efforts to per
petuate the progress made through the
organization of educational institutions
to pass on to others what had been at
tained. I have also tried to give a
proper setting to the great historic
forces which have shaped and moulded
human progress, and have made the
evolution of modern state school sys
tems and the world-wide spread of
Western civilization both possible and
inevitable."
This is an accurate statement of the
general character of the work. The
history of educational theory has been
reduced to minor .proportions in favor
of more extensive interpretations of
trends in social organization, politics
and religion with regard to their in
fluence on education.
Professor Cubberley's "History," as
well as the companion volume of
"Readings," is an outgrowth of his
teaching in the Department of Educa
tion at Stanford which began 22 years
aero. At that timq he arranged a syllabus
of lectures for the course in the His
tory of Education which, in 1902, was
published in book form and, in 1905,
issued in an enlarged edition.
No other text in the history of edu
cation contains so many or such well
chosen illustrations. The "History" has
18 plates and 240 figures, the "Readings"
90 figures. The illustrations, in a sense,
typify the text; that it, the effort
throughout is to attain concreteness and
definiteness of treatment. The method
is one which makes the subject matter
tangible for the student, gives it bodv
and base of a kind which the average
history of education has too little of.
A carefully prepared index adds to the
usefulness of the "History."
The "History" and the illustrative
"Readings" begin with the foundation
of Western civilization and education in
Greece and Rome, taking up next the
med'aeval world and the transition from
the mediaeval to modern attitudes, and
finally, discussing modern times, the
educational development is considered
in the leading European nations and in
the United States. In the final chapters
Professor Cubberley discusses the forces
by which education in the United States
became a great national tool, and takes
up the tendencies operating to influence
education at the present time, including
political, scentific industrial, and socio
logical factors, as well as newer de
velopments in the organization and
technique of education itself.

Dr. El wood P. Cubberley, head of the
Department of Education at Stanford,
has just published, through the Hough
ton-Mifflin Company, "The History of
Education," an 850-page volume cover
ing the development of educational prac
tice and progress in the world from a
different angle than that of any previous
work. Accompanying this book is a
companion volume, "Readings in the
History of Education," which, in 684
pages, offers a collection of sources and
readings illustrating the development of
educational practice, theory, and organ
ization, supplementary to the text of
the "History."
The character of Professor Cubber
ley's new "History" is indicated by the
sub-title of the volume, "Educational
Practices and Progress Considered as a
Phase of the Development and Spread
of Western Civilization," and by an
excerpt from his preface in which he
says:
"I have not tried to prepare another
history of educational theories. Of such
we already have a sufficient number. In
stead, I have tried to prepare a history
of the progress and practice and organ
ization of education itself, and to give
to such a history its proper setting as
a phase of the history of the develop
ment and spread of our Western civiliza
tion, I have especially tried to present
sucli a picture of the rise, struggle for
existence, growth, and recent great ex
pansion of the idea of the improvability
of the race and the elevation and eman
cipation of the individual through edu
cation as would be most illuminating
and useful to students of the subject.
To this end I have traced the great for
ward steps in the emancipation of the
intellect of man. and the efforts to per
petuate the progress made through the
organization of educational institutions
to pass on to others what had been at
tained. I have also tried to give a
proper setting to the great historic
forces which have shaped and moulded
human progress, and have made the
evolution of modern state school sys
tems and the world-wide spread of
Western civilization both possible and
inevitable."
This is an accurate statement of the
general character of the work. The
history of educational theory has been
reduced to minor .proportions in favor
of more extensive interpretations of
trends in social organization, politics
and religion with regard to their in
fluence on education.
Professor Cubberley's "History," as
well as the companion volume of
"Readings," is an outgrowth of his
teaching in the Department of Educa
tion at Stanford which began 22 years
aero. At that timq he arranged a syllabus
of lectures for the course in the His
tory of Education which, in 1902, was
published in book form and, in 1905,
issued in an enlarged edition.
No other text in the history of edu
cation contains so many or such well
chosen illustrations. The "History" has
18 plates and 240 figures, the "Readings"
90 figures. The illustrations, in a sense,
typify the text; that it, the effort
throughout is to attain concreteness and
definiteness of treatment. The method
is one which makes the subject matter
tangible for the student, gives it bodv
and base of a kind which the average
history of education has too little of.
A carefully prepared index adds to the
usefulness of the "History."
The "History" and the illustrative
"Readings" begin with the foundation
of Western civilization and education in
Greece and Rome, taking up next the
med'aeval world and the transition from
the mediaeval to modern attitudes, and
finally, discussing modern times, the
educational development is considered
in the leading European nations and in
the United States. In the final chapters
Professor Cubberley discusses the forces
by which education in the United States
became a great national tool, and takes
up the tendencies operating to influence
education at the present time, including
political, scentific industrial, and socio
logical factors, as well as newer de
velopments in the organization and
technique of education itself.
