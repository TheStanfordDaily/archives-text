## 
### 
Joyce Lewis, First Vice-Commander
of the American Legion for the year
1920 and presiding officer of the Na
tional Convention at Cleveland, spoke
last night at the meeting of Fremont
Post, 52, in the Red Cross Hut of the
Base Hospital. He told exactly what
the Legion is doing toward getting
bonuses for ex-service men, and what
opposition they have encountered in
Washington. The Legion has pro
posed four types of bonuses: Land,
Home, Aid, Vocational, and Cash. He
advised all patients of the Base Hos
pital to write to some Congressman
and put their viewpoint squarely be
for him. Lewis is now a student in
vocational training at Stanford.
Commander H. W. Maloney, in ad
dressing the patients of the Hospital,
said: "Fremont Post is behind you
to a man and will see that each and
every one of you receive a square
deal." During the meeting a patient
revealed an entertainment plan for
the hospital which was falling through
because of lack of funds. Commandi r
Maloney immediately authorized a
committee to put the thing across.
That is the type of action taken by
the Post.
Fremont Post has been meeting in
the Community House but within the
month will have a building of its own
with fireplaces and pool tables, where
members may go at all times. Each
man will be given a key and as two
make a quorum, a party may be
thrown every night if desired.
The entertainment program con
sisted of violin and vocal selections
by Miss Mamie Moynihan and Mrs.
Marie De Forrest-Edwards of Palo
Alto, and several piano selections by
C. W. Midgely, '22.
