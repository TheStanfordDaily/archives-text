# STANFORD ALUMNI ARE MEMBERS OF FIRST PARTY TO AID IN GERMAN RELIEF
## Catherine Cox of Language Department Tells Work of U. S.

Stanford has the honor of claiming
two members of the first party to go
to Europe in co-operation with the
American Relief Association of which
Herbert Hoover is the Director. As
members of the French Service Com
mittee, Miss Catherine Cox, '12, and
Mr. Albert J. Brown, '92, left New
York in January, 1920. Miss Cox, who
is now an instructor in German here,
was placed in charge of the fourth
district for child feeding work in
Germany. Her headquarters were in
Berlin, with 85 cities and 150,000
children under her supervision.
The organization began with cities
of 50,000 population and by efficient
work, extended its activities to larger
cities. It was not until the first of
March that the committe was able
to work effectively due to the un
settled conditions in Germany. On
the first day, however, the feeding of
the undernourished, helpless children
began. Miss Cox states that 50 per
cent of the children are underfed and
are from one to two years behind the
normal growth. In this weakened con
dition they are constantly to
contagious diseases with which the
committee has to deal. In Vienna the
situation is even more serious thai}
in Germany. It is estimated that 85
per cent of the infants are aenemic.
So far, it has been impossible to
feed more than one-half of the chil
dren in need but the committee esti
mates that after one year's work, 650,-
000 children have been fed in 400
cities. The fact that Americans doing
this work in Germany are regarded
with the highest respect and with
even a touch of devotion by the Ger
man people, shows that this work has
been one of the greatest value.
Miss Anna Cox, '09, has also return
ed from Germany where she was in
charge of feeding the undernourished
students of fifteen universities. Her
work was done under the auspices of
the Society of Friends which is in
co-operation with the American French
Service Commttee. Apart from the
feeding responsibility, Miss Cox was
asked to deliver a series of lectures
in the English Department of the Uni
versity of Berlin.
