## 
### 
The Y. M. C. A. will close its finan
cial campaign for funds to carry on the
year's work this week. Representatives
of the "Y" have personally interviewed
practically every member of the student
body and faculty, and from the partial
returns already received the campaign
has been unusually successful.
Some opposition was encountered be
cause of the conduct of the Y. M. C. A.
during the war, but the fact that the
Stanford "Y" must carry on its own
work, irrespective of the national or
ganization, is sufficient to persuade most
of the students that a small donation is
necessary if the "Y" is to continue put
ting out the Frosh Bible, sending depu
tations to nearby high schools, continue
the series of lectures by world-famous
men in the World Problems Forum, and
other things equally benefiicial to Stan
ford.
