# AMBULANCE HISTORY INCLUDES FEATURES BY STANFORD MEN
## 
### 
Many Stanford men appear in the
recently published three volume,
"History of the American Field Ser
vice in France," both as writers and
as subjects of material. The "His
tory" is a compilation by members
of the Ambulance Units, largely col
lege men, who were sent to France
under the auspices of the "Friends
of France" in 1914-1917.
The books conta'in a complete re
view of the activities of this organi
zation and detailed account of the
experiences of each of the divisions
and units together with a large amount
of supplementary material offered by
the individual members. The ma
terial included special chapters and
excerpts from letters and diaries and
contributions to various service pub
lications in France, and from volumes
published since that time.
R. A. Donaldson, F. T. Taylor, and
G. W. Hall, figure prominently in the
preparation of the work.
The volume is illustrated by photo
graphs, maps and with drawings
among which appear a number by
George W. Hall, some of which have
been reproduced in the "Cardinal."
Stanford organized the first unit
in the American Field Service to go
from the Pacific Coast and latrer sent
a number of others. Among the il
lustrations in the volume is a photo
graph of the immense public meeting
in San Francisco in April, 1917, at
which Stanford and the University of
California units were presented with
flags for service in France. The first
Stanford unit had already entered
service at that time, and its flag
taken to it by Arthur Kimber. This
is the subject of a volume published
as a memorial to him, "The First
Flag." Among other illustrations pe
culiarly interesting to Stanford is a
reproduction in color of the panel of
tne ambulance of the first Stanford
section showing two trees reminiscent
of the Palo Alto tree, flanking the
shield of "The Friends of France,"
all on a cardinal ground.
In the introduction of the volume
special thanks are given to Frank J.
Taylor and Robert A. Donaldson,
members of the Stanford units, for aid
in preparing the letter press of the
volume, and to George W. Hall for
assistance in the illustrations.
Among the Stanford men who ap
