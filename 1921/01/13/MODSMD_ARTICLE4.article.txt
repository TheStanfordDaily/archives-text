# Eastern University Devotees of Dancing Must Give Guarantee Of No "Ruff Stuff"
## 
### 
Northwestern University takes no
risks with the morals of its students
entailed by the modern and progressive
styles of dancing. Indeed, no! In fact,
the university requires every campus
organization to sign a pledge guarantee
ing that no ultra-modern or unseemly
conduct was engaged in, following every
campus dance. In addition, tkis must
he certified to by some member of the
alumni of the organization.
The pledge reads as follows: "This
is to certify that during the dance just
finished I saw no shimmying, cheek-to
cheek dancing, or any other objection
able feature."
