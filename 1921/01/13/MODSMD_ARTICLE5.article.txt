# 1924 BASKETERS WIN FROM PALO ALTO HIGH
## Cardinal Babes Defeat Local Prep School in One-Sided Game at the Encina Gym 
### 
Last night in the first freshman
game of the season the babe quin
tet defeated the Palo Alto Union High
School by a score of 36 to 8. This
was the first game that either team
had played and although the contest
was rather slow, the teams fought
hard. The freshmen getting, the tip
off rushed the ball down to their goal
by a series of short passes and good
team work. A few minutes later Mc-
Hose looped in a long or.e and the
score stood 2 to 0 in favor of the
frosh. This seemed to be a starter
for two shots quickly followed the
first one. The half ended 25 to 4 in
favor of Stanford.
At the beginning of the second half
Coach Seay put in an entire new
team. These men played well and
continued to mail.tain the lead made
by the other five. Good defensive
work on the part of Palo Alto in this
half caused the frosh to make longer
shots, most of which were good.
Fight was the keynote of the game.
Stellar work on the part of McHose
at forward and Jensen at center, for
the freshmen was the real feature of
the game. By their team work and
shooting these two rolled up a score of
21 points. Whiltenberg played a good
game at running guard and was partly
responsible for the low score of the
high school lads. For the high school
Captain Harper at center and Walter
Hays at running guard played the
better brand of basketball. The team,
considering that it has been playing
for less than a week gave the fresh
men a good game but owing to poor
basket shooting the score was rather
low.
The men that started the game
were:
Stanford —McHose, If; Granger, rf;
Jensen, c; Whitteirberg, lg; Mannoc
cir, rg.
Palo Alto—Richards, If; Harper, rf;
Allen, c; Hays, lg; Troutman, rg.
Both teams were replaced in the
second half. *
