# BETA THETA PI WINS SECOND INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL MATCH
## 
### 
Staging a rough and speedy exhibi-!
tion that, resembled football almost as j
much as basketball, the Beta Theta
Pi goal tossers won their second game !
in the intramural series, by a 13 to 6 j
victory over the Off-Campus quintet,
yesterday afternoon. The game was
hotly contested throughout, and the
rough style of play was so close an
imitation of football that two or three
end runs were attempted.
The Kappa Sigma five established a
reputation for rapid goal shooting by
overwhelming the Phi Kappa Sigma's
by a 25 to 2 score. Playing a fast
game thÂ£ Chi Psi's defeated the Se
quoia (second floor) quintet, 9 to 3.
The El Campo team won a hard
fought contest from the Zeta Psi
basket artists scoring 13 points to
their opponent's 6.
Theta Xi was given a 2 to 0 decisi
on over the.Sequoia Ist and 4th team,
which failed to appear. No games
were played Tuesday, because of the
failure of many organizations to l>ut
their teams on the court. Those not
appearing on schedule time were list
ed as defeated, and percentages will
be computed on this basis. *.
Five teams now remain in the 1000
per cent column for the second round
games, they are Medics, Encina (east
third), El Campo, Kappa Sigma, and
Chi Psi.
The games are drawing an increas
ing number of spectators.
One example of an innovation in
basketball playing was given by Young
of the Off-Campus team, and Frede
ricks of the Beta Theta Pi quintet.
Young squatted over the ball on the
black line preparatory to a try for a
goal on a foul. His position over the
ball was so near like that of "Swede"
Rightes playing center in football that
Fredericks lined up a la "Fat" Latham,
whereupon Young clinched on tfle un
weildy pigskin, and giving Fredericks
a shove, made a dash for the goal
line.
