# STANFORD AND ST. MARY'S COURT TEAMS WILL CLASH IN ENCINA GYM TOMORROW
## BABES WILL MEET CITY TEAM CONSIDERED ONE OF FASTEST IN SAN FRANCISCO PREP SCHOOL BASKETBALL LEAGUE 
### 
Things will happen when the varsify
basketball teams of St. Mary's and
Stanford meet on Encina Gymnasium
court tomorrow night. St. Mary's Col
lege is determined to make up in the
remaining sports what it suffered
through the disbanding of its football
eleven last fall. Their team has been
greatly strengthened by the return of
Bob Moy who was a star in pre-war
days. Moy is regarded as one of the
best basket tossers in the west. He was
chosen captain of the five last week.
Stanford has now started on the way
to the championship of the California-
Nevada league and it is going to be ex
ceedingly difficult to stop thme. Conse
quently, the game tomorrow night
should be a bummer.
Coach Powell has about decided that
the lineup which started the game with
the Olympic Club and Santa Clara will
be the permanent team for the rest of
the season. This opinion is subject to
change, however, as several of the sec
ond string players are displaying lots of
class, and if they keep coming at the
rate they are now it is going to be dif
ficult to rule some of them off.
"Swede" Righter and Davies form a
nice working combination in the forward
line. Righter is clever both on the
offense and defense while Davies is a
veritable streak at getting over the
court.
Bert Mills has been playing some ball
at center. His basket shooting in the
two games played has been one of the
features.
Dick Richmond seems to be the logical
man for the running guard job. Rich
mond is fast and tricky. He is a dan
gerous man with the ball for he has
the habit of dropping them from the
center of the court when the opposition
figures that he will not try a shot but
will pass.
Captain Adams is playing the same
brand of ball that featured his work last
year, and believe us, that is some brand.
Having size, weight, and plenty of fight
Adams is king in his section of the court.
The game tomorrow night will be cal
led fifteen minutes earlier than the usual
starting time, that is, at eight o'clock,
in order that the St. Mary's College
team can start for Oakland at an early
hour. The admission charge will be
fifty cents to outsiders, while student
body ticket holders will be admitted up
on presentation of their cards.

Coach Seay's "Babe" quintet goes up
against its first real opposition tomorrow
night when they meet the lads from
Lowell High School in San Francisco.
The game is slated for 7:30. The Low
ell basket shooters have a fast team and
will make a strong bid for the title this
year. From the beating that the Frosh
handed the Palo Alto High School last
Wednesday they look pretty good, but
the Palo Alto quintet was no opposi
tion.
Last night the Freshmen played the
Varsity in a scrimmage that lasted for
more than an hour. McHose and
Granger started at forward, with Coop
er and Smith in the guard positions, and
Jansen at center. Quick work on the
part of the babes and the accuracy of
McHose's shooting rang up two counts
for the first year five in the first min
ute of play. Smith at guard was play
ing a first classs game last night. He
looks like a good man for the position.
Wittenberg showed some real class in
the last few minutes of the practice
when he several times dribbled the ball
past Fred Adams to within striking dis
tance of the basket. His work in ad
vancing the sphere down the court
against the varsity guards was clever.
Granger is handy with the ball but is
too dependent on his fellow forward in
the basket shooting. He puts up a stiff
game though for the opposing guards
and is there in the pinch for the baskets
from a difficult angle.
The new rule in regard to starting a
dribble from a standstill hampered both
the Varsity and the Freshmen last night.
They have been in the habit of taking
a step previous to the starting of the
dribble, and failure to mind the new
rule cost both sides a number of techin
cal penalties. The clever work of Mc-
Hose in shooting the free tosses piled
up the single points for the freshmen.
His work in the making of free throws
will play an important part in the scor
ing upon a team that is in the habit of
making fouls.
