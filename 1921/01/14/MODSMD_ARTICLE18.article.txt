# ATHLETIC RECOGNITION
## 
### 
Today's news columns carry the announcement that four Stanford
athletic officials—Dr. A. D. Browne, W. D. Powell, E. R. Brandsten,
and W. H. Maloney—have been appointed on committees of the Na
tional Inter-Collegiate Conference. This is a significant announcement,
indicating the amount of recognition that the West, and particularly
Stanford, has received at the hands of national athletic authorities.
The four sports represented by the appointments are football, track,
swimming, and boxing. The West has claimed superiority in these de
partments of athletics for some time, but the appointment of the Stan
ford officials is the first official recognition given by the East to the
West. The appointment of Coach Walter Powell is especially signifi
cant for the entire West, as it is the first time in football history that a
man west of Minnesota has been appointed to the Rules Committee.
Coach Powell intends that the Universities west of the Rockies shall
get the full benefit of his appointment, and he has announced that a
meeting will be called of all Western coaches to discuss recommenda
tions to the Rules Committee.
Stanford has had successful track, swimming, and boxing teams
for some time, and the men in charge of these sports were chosen for
their skill and reputation. The selections have been wise, as the ap
pointments on the committees of the National Intercollegiate Conference
indicate. 4
