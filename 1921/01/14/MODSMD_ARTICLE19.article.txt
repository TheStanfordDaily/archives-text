# CONDUCT AT GAMES
## 
### 
Students who attend the basketball games have to submit to enough
discomfort due to the lack of spectator's space without having to breathe
die bad air caused by smoking. Until this year, custom has always
prevented men from smoking in the gymnasium, but this season has
seen that rule broken openly. It not only makes conditions unsanitary
tor the spectators, but causes Injury to those participating in the games.
A. little thought on*the part of the offenders should cause a cessation
of this practice.
