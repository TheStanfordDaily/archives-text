# Freshman Dance Will Be Staged Tomorrow Evening at Encina
## 
### 
Tomorrow night at the Encina Club
dance floor in the Hall the class of '24
will give its first dance of the year, and
from what the ouija board and the
weather man tell us, it will be a good
one. The committee on entertainment
that has been preparing the necessary
ingrediants for the mixture report that
everything has been satisfactorily ar
ranged and everyone who comes will
have a time they will not regret.
The amount of money per couple that
must change hands before admittance is
granted is $1.65, which includes war
tax. The proceeds from the dance will
go toward funrnishing the freshman
football players with sweaters.
