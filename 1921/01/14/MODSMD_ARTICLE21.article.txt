# California's Baseball Prospects Are Bright
## 
### 
With practically all of last year's
freshmen and varsity baseball men
back for practice this season the
chance for California to have a ban
ner baseball team was greatly in
creased. This combined with return
ed veterans, from former
and the large number of transfers
will give Coaah Zamlock a jsquad
with an unusual amount of experi
ence. Zamlock is now in Hawaii but
will return in time to pick and shape
his men for the coming season which
starts on February 15. Practice, how
ever, is now under way and "Bud"
Myers, captain of the Bear nine, is
now doing everything possible to per
fect the workings of his squad.
