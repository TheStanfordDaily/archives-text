Professor Payson J. Treat of the
History Department delivered a talk to
Euphronia Debating Srvciety on Propa
ganda and Public Opinion last night in
the Little Theatre previous to the Nes
toria - Santa Clara debate. Treat traced
the use of propaganda in all countries
during the war to influence public opin
ion in neutral countries and to break
down the morale of opposing nations.
In connection with the latter he spoke
of the use of airplanes to drop leaflets
over th<? enemy lines for propaganda
purposes. In contrast to the use of pro
paganda in war he showed the use of
propaganda in the political issues which
America has faced in the last genera
tion. As an instance of how propaganda
may sweep over a nation and cause pub
lic opinion to demand war Professor
Treat cited the instance of the sinking
of the Maine, bringing on the Spanish-
American war. While no one actually
knew how the ship was sunk, propa
ganda was used to instill the idea that
it was an act of Spain.
The Japanese problem also comes in
for its share of propaganda and Treat
showed how it is being used in some
cases to create ill feeling between the
two countries.
