# ALPHA KAPPA LAMBDA QUINTET WINS FROM STRONG BREAKERS FIVE
## Game Is Close and Marked By Good Basket Work On Both Sides 
### 
Playing fast ball before an unsuual
number of spectators, the Alpha Kappa
Lambda quintet added another hard won
victory to its record by nosing out the
Breakers with a 19-16 score in the sec
ond round of the intramural basket ball
series yesterday afternoon. Cornell, of
the Alpha Kappa Lambda five, was the
star of the game, scoring 15 of the 19
points for his team.
The game was marked by better shoot
ing and faster play than any of the pre
ceding contests. The score was close
throughout, arid the outcome hung in
the balance until time was called. Th
first half ended in a tie, 8 to 8.
Playing at the same time, the Sequoia
Third Floor basket tossers romped away
with the lond end of a 14 to 2 score,
sending the Alpha Sigma Phi quintet
down from the 1000 per cent berth to
the 500 mark, and raising their own per
centage from the zero column to the
half-way station. The Sequoia team lost
its first game hy one point.
Failure of the Encina West First five
to appear gave the Entre Nous team a
2-0 decision over the Hall men.
The teams thus far undefeated in the
second round are: Medics. Encina East
Third, El Campo, Kappa Sigma, Chi
Psi, and Alpha Kappa Lambda.
Two games are slated for tomorrow.
The Encina East Second Floor five will
meet the Kappa Alpha squad, and the
Encina East First will battle the Delta
Kappa Epsilon five.
The Kappa Sigma and Phi Kappa
Sigma quintets were originally scheduled
to tangle tomorrow, but by mutual
agreement met ahead of time according
to the intramural ruling, which allows
contests to be held at any time previous
to the date set.
