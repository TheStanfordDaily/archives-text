N® more will the timid and the weak
dare to stray without the confines of the
Quad at night without some young can
non or butcher knives as accompani
ment. The startling news has come that
on more than one occasion mountain
lions have been observed within four
miles, of the campus.
Evidently the news has as yet failed
to cause any great consternation, even
though it is true. Probably because the
thought of most is that a miss is as
good as a mile, and a mountain lion four
miles away is a harmless beast. But the
fact remains that a mountain lion hunt
has been held, in which participated
some of the prominent University offic
ials, and another one is planned for Sat
urday. Perhaps the zoology department
will have a new skin to add to its col
lection before the affair terminates—
who knows?
