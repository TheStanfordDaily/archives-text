# Stanford-Olympic Soccer Contest Is To Be Played in S.F.
## 
### 
Tom rrow Stanford's soccer team
stands pitted again√üt the Olympic
Club in what may well be called the
most crucial contest of the 1920-21
season. Not much time has been giv
en the Cardinal players to get into
condition sinco the Christmas holi
days, but the team is in good shape
and confident that it will be a hard
fouglit battle no matter who comes
out on top. The game will be played
tomorrow afternoon in Sun Francisco
at the field at Bth and Market streets.
Forecasting the dope on this game
is like trying to tell whether or not
it will rain this time next year. Both
are equally uncertain propositions.
Stanford's team has not yet met de
feat; but on the other hand, they face
an unknown quality, a dark horse, in
the clubmen. The Olympics have im
proved so rapidly of late that any
estimate made on comparison of pre
vious games played are useless.
Only three points behind the Cardi
nal league-leaders in the for
the flag, the Olympics tomorrow are
determined to put up the strongest
kind of a fight to win, so that the
close of the day will find them resting
dangerously close to first place. From
the Cardinal point of view, a Stanford
victory is especially desirable inas
much as it will mean the practical
cinching of the league championship.
The team finishing on top when the
season ends will become the posses
sor of a trophy, with individual medals
for the players themselves.
Inspection of the lineup shows that
practacally the same team that beat
California last quarter will go on the
field tomorrow. The only changes that
have been made have strengthened
the team, so that there is good rea
son to suppose that another victory
will be added to the list if the team
work lives up to expectations. The
position of goal will be filled by Cap
tain Harvey Newlands, who has
shown brilliant work throughout the
season in blocking opposition attempts
to score. The two backs, Adams and
Anderson, are in their same old po
sitions, where , they liave both ex
hibited throughout the season an of
fensive brand of defense that has
been invaluable at times. A slight
shift has been made in the forward
line, where Weller will play center
forward. His work has been consist
autly improving and he will be a
valuable factor in holding the forward
line together for effective team work.
The team will leave on the 11:34
train tomorrow morning. They will
be guests of the Olympic Club for
luncheon and will be able "to use the
club's facilities both before and after
the game.
The Stanford line-up for the game
follows:
Newland, goal; Anderson, right
back; Adams, left back; Wing, right
half; Robinson, center half; Gorman,
left half; Mendoza, outside right;
Campbell, inside right; Weller, center
forward; Strauss, inside left; Mead,
outside left.
