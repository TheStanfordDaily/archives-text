# Santa Clara Defeats Nestoria In Debate On Immigration Laws
## 
### 
Santa Clara wrested a two to one
decision in favor of the affirmative
from Nestoria Debating Society in a
debate on the question, "Resolved, that
one oÂ£ the great reconstructive mea
sures needed to allay the present so
cial unrest is the enactment of more
stringent and comprehensive immigra
tion laws."
The Santa Clara team based its
arguments upon the failure of the
present immigration laws to provide
for the Americanization, education,
distribution, and employment of the
present flood of immigrants. They
showed farther that the supply of
cheap labor from foreign lands is re
ducing the standard of living of tlie
native American workmen.
The basis of Nestoria's debate was
the fact that immigration is not a
f ause for the present social unrest
but that the disturbances now mani
fest are an immediate effect of the
great war and not peculiar to Amer
ica alone. tried further to prove
that ihe character of immigrants now
coming into the country is good and
that the stndard may be raised by
more stringent enforcement of the
laws, particularly the literacy require
ment.
V. B. Cappa, '23, Lowell Gerson,
'22, and Martin Devries, '20, formed
Nestoria's team, with Emmet McCaf
fery, '24, as alternative. Cappa opened
the debate with a well organized and
well delivered talk, basing his case
upon tho adequacy of the present laws.
Gerson who continued the debate for
Nestoria, pointed (Tut the real causes
for industrial unrest, which have
grown out of the recent war. Devries
closed the case for Nestoria with one
of the best delivered speeches of the
evening, but appealing more to senti
ment than reason.
Tho Santa Clara team was well
balanced and prepared, which coupled
with an effective style of delivery,
resulted in a decision for them.
