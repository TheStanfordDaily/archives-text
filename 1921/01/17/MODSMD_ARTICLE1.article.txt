### 
Drawings for seats to the Masquers'
comedy production, "Trelawney of the
Wells," to be staged in the Assembly
Hall next Friday evening, will be held
in the Administration Building tomor
row afternoon at 1 o'clock. The price
of admission will be $1 for orchestra
seats and 75 cents for seats in the gal
lery. No war tax will be charged.
The play to be given next Friday
evening is to take the place of the
regular Masquers' lake production. This
is one of the most ambitious perform
ances attempted by college actors. Filled
from start to finish with wit and
humor, it is one of the most sparkling
comedies ever written. It is the kind
of a play that will please a campus audi
ence, striking a happy medium between
heavy and farcical comedy.
Comical and clever character parts
add to the play an dif
ferent atmosphere. The setting, an Eng
lish theater of the mid-Victorian period,
the Wells, makes the production unique.
Melba Berry, who takes the role of
Avonia Bunn, leading comedy and char
acter part of the Masquers' play, re
ceived commendable recognition in the
San Francisco Chronicle yesterday. Miss
Berry has won favor in past productions
for her ability to handle character parts.
The character, Miss Bunn, leads an "ex
ceptionally speedy" life and likes her
merriment and sips of the "red fluid"
as well as anybody. A talent of Miss
Berry seems to be in the reproduction
of the influences of "too much In
a production last year she did well at
demonstrating her ability to handle such
parts. â€¢
The eighteen members of the cast are
picked from some of the best dramatic
talent of the campus, including some
persons who have never before appeared
on the stage here. A. D. Cohan, in the
role of Tom Wrench, a young play
wright, will make his first appearance
Friday night. Cohan handles his char
acter with great pase and is clearly an
actor of ability.
After the play the Masquers' Society
will give a dance at the Women's Club
house. Although the comedy is a four
act production, the play will be over in
time for the dance.
