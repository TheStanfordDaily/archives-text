Interest in the recital to be given
by Louis Graveure at the Assembly

20, is constantly increasing. The
artist's distinctive personality, for he
is not only a noted singer, but an
athlete, all-round, out-of-door man,
artist and student, and the very fine
program "which has been announced,
has aroused the local music lovers
to a high degree of anticipation.
The life of this concert. singer is
completely devoted to his art. Mar
ried to the singer, Eleanor Painter,
he has made his environment always
subservient to his art, and all that
will enable him to broaden his music
al sphere. Previous to his concert;
stage successes, Mr. Graveure was
rather a gentleman of fortune. He
took life as it came to him, enduring
many experiences which perhaps later
allowed him to color his songs so con
vincingly. In the cold forests of
Canada he has hunted big game, liv
ing among that picturesque group of
mon who make trapping and hunting
their life work. He has followed up
the diamond streams of Africa.
Speaking of the concert given by
Graveure at Hartford, the Hartford

from Graveure's recital considered as
a performance, would savor of patron
izing or what is worpe. the kind of
foolishness that is unnecessary wis

to which nothing could have been
added nor anything taken away."
