# CARDINAL QUINTET RUNS STEAM ROLLER OVER ST. MARY'S IN SLOW CONTEST
## Stanford Basketeers Run Up 53 Points and Allow Visitors A Total Score of Nine 
### 
St. Mary's basketball five was no match for the Stanford varsity. Powell's
men walloped the transbayites soundly, the score being 53 to 9. From the opening
whistle it was apparent that the game was no contest. Stanford forged into the
lead immediately and ran up a score of 28 to 8 yi the first half.
The much-advertised Moy, captain of the St. Mary's five, failed to show any
thing that would mark him as one of the best players on the coast. He was up
against too tough a proposition in Freddie Adams and he had but few 'shots
at the basket.

In the second half Coach Powell dis
placed the varsity by second-string men.
This half was even worse than the lirst,
for the second squad piled up 28 more
points while the Oaklanders were mak
ing one. Apparently Coach Powell has
some high-powered substitutes.
Bert Mills was the star of the game.
He shot ten field goals for a total of
twenty points during the time he played.
Ralph Carver, who replaced Mills at
the beginning of the second half,
dropped four through the hoop, tieing
"Swede" Righter for the second high
score.
From a review of the three games
played thus far it is beginning to look
as if a mighty clever team will be re
quired to give the Cardinal quintet a
workout. However, the first two con
ference games that are to be played with
the Oregon Aggies next Friday and Sat
tirday should give the local fans a line
on the strength of the Stanford aggre
gation. The score:
