# CARDINAL QUINTET RUNS STEAM ROLLER OVER ST. MARY'S IN SLOW CONTEST

lead immediately and ran up a score of 28 to 8 yi the first half.
The much-advertised Moy, captain of the St. Mary's five, failed to show any

for the second squad piled up 28 more
points while the Oaklanders were mak

Bert Mills was the star of the game.
He shot ten field goals for a total of
twenty points during the time he played.
Ralph Carver, who replaced Mills at

"Swede" Righter for the second high
score.

as if a mighty clever team will be re
quired to give the Cardinal quintet a
workout. However, the first two con

the Oregon Aggies next Friday and Sat
