# LOWELL DEFEATED BY FRESHMAN FIVE
## Cardinal Babes Are Accurate In Basket Shooting; Chalk 34 Points to Visitors' 9 
### 
From the first whistle to the final
gun, last Saturday night, the Lowell
quintet was swept off its feet and
although the San Francisco lads
fought hard they were unable to com
pete with the superior team work and
skillful basketshooting of the fresh
men. The babes were expected to
win, but not by such a score as 34
to !), which was the final result of the
game. Lowell High School's basket
ball teams have always compared with
the best of the prep school teams and
if anything- can be judged from this
fact it will be a very prosperous year
for Stanford's first-year team.
The first half, which was featured
by long shots, ended in a 20-4 score
for the freshmen. Good guarding on
the part of Lowell's center and run
ning guard not only made these shots
necessary but helped to keep down
the score of the frosh.
In the second half, Coach Seay be
gan to shift in some of the other men
of the squad. These men played a
very steady game and although they
did not try such long shots the scor
ing machine of the frosh seemed
little effected, as can readily be seen
by the final score. In this period the
new men, which Lowell had put in,
tried to stage a comeback by long
shots from tl»e center of the floor, but
the majority of these shots, either
went wild or failed to have tho neces
sary altitude, netting only a single
basket.
Coach Seay has an unusually fine
bunch of material to work with this
year. Up to this time his team has
been a little weak in the defensive
positions but last Saturday's game
proves that he has found a remedy
for this difficulty. His new system of
play is undoubtedly one of the finest
ever taught to any freshman five and
its value has already been seen.
Jansen, center for the freshmen,
without doubt was the star of the
game. Brilliant basket shooting from
very difficult angles combined with
the fact that he seemed to be every
where on the court and into the ma
jority of the plays placed him as one
of the babes' best bets.
Mcllose played his usual scientific
game as forward. Long shots are his
specialty and whenever he shoots the
fan can usually add another basket
to the freshman score.
