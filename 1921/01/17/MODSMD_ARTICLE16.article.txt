shine," in the words of Yell Leader

Coach Powell and Captain Fred
Adams will talk to the exponents of
basketball, and will be succeeded on the
platform by "Dink" Templeton, who will
outline the spring's work on the track
and field.
Baseball will have the speaking sup
port of Coach Seay, while Morris Kirk
sey and Dr. Frank Angell will try to
expand the enthusiasm in track and field
after "Dink" Tenipleton's send-off.
Everybody will be called upon to sign
up for some branch of activity.
Kinney has called the rally for 7:30
and asks that the customary parades to
Encina be started in time to allow the
evening's program to continue as sched
uled. *
