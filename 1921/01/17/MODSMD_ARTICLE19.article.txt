# STREET CAR FARE RAISE
## 
### 
While prices in general are on the downward path, it is hard to
accept such an announcement as that issued by the Peninsular Railway
Comipany applying to the State Railroad Commission for an increase in
fares. This increase is applicable to the company's line running out to
the campus, and if granted, Stanford students will pay a fare of 10
cents to go to and from the campus. Undoubtedly the Peninsular Rail
way Company needs to purchase a large amount of equipment, and
has had to meet a number of problems which may require additional
revenue. The company will have to justify its application before the
railroad commission, but the phase that interests residents of the cam
pus is the extremely poor service that has been given for 6 cents.
From all indications it has been the practice of the Peninsular Com
pany to shunt all of its poor equipment from San Jose to L'alo Alto,
with the result that nearly every day one of the cars leaves the track
or some part of the system is put out of commission. There is supposed
to be a schedule for the cars to run upon, but in practice it is seldom
adhered to. There are innumerable cases that can be cited to show
where the employees have held up the cars to gossip or argue over
questions on their running time.
Such service was not worth 6 cents, and it will take a good stretch
of imagination to make most campus people believe that the same serv
ice is worth 10 cents. If it is the intention of the company to purchase
new equipment for its San Jose lines and give the Palo Alto line the
old San Jose cars, another kick is coming. If we are forced to pay a
10-cent fare on a single-track system, such a fare should purchase trans
portation on mjodern cars that can make the published schedule, or one
giving faster service.
The hearing before the Railroad Commission will take place in
San Jose on Wednesday, and in the interests of the Stanford community
official representatives of the student body should be there to present
the Stanford case.
