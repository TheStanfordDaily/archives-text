# VANCOUVER RUGBY UNION PRESIDENT COMPLIMENTS TEAM
## 
### 
Colonel R. Bell-Irving, president of
the Vancouver Rugby Union, has writ
ten to President Wilbur to compliment
the Stanford rugby team which played
in British Columbia during the Christ
mas holidays, for the sportsmanship and
gentlemanly behavior of the Stanford
men. He also has a word of praise for
Harry Maloney, the coach and manager
of the team.
Colonel Irving says that this Christ
mas trip of the Stanford team has
strengthened them in their eagerness for
an annual international intervarsity con
test in Vancouver during the Christmas
holidays. Mr. J. Nelson, editor of the
Vancouver World, he says, has donated
a handsome cup for interuniversity
rugby, and the details of a constitution
to govern its award are now being com
pleted.
"We are delighted," Colonel Irving
writes, "to see so many of our old
friends among the personnel of your
team this year, and only trust we may
have the pleasure of seeing them back
again.
"As a team they are to be heartily
congratulated, and only the highest
praise can be given for the remarkable
way in which they quickly adapted them
selves to local conditions calling for an
entire.ly different type of game from
that to which they were accustomed.
"While the honors in Vancouver were
divided, they had the satisfaction of
knowing that their line was not crossed.
"Another pleasing and perhaps re
markable feature for which their coach
and manager, Mr. Harry Maloney, de
serves credit, was that they were able
to play four very strenuous games in ten
days with only one spare man.
"A most favorable impression has
been created among those who witnessed
the games, or had the good fortune of
meeting your boys, of their commend
able behavior both on and off the held.
Throughout their tour without excep
tion every member of the team played
a clean, hard game, and 1 can assure
you it gave me the greatest pleasure to
referee three of the four games of such
sportsmen."
