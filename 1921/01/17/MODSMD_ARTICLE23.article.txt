Chronicle headline reads, "Smokers,
chewers, drinkers, to have hell all
their own, says, Volvia." Seems to be

A plunge into a natatorium filled
with whisky, wine and beer will fea
ture the premier appearance of booze
fighters in what this reformer calls

The midnight rounders will go back
to the old song that goes, "If the ocean
was whisky and I was a duck, I'd dive
to the bottom and never come up."

Champagne Charlie hopes that the
hootch vat is equipped with rails about

ably be enough to make him cuss
when he thinks what the gin hounds
are getting.
