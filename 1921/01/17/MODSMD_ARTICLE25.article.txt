tercollegiate athletic contest, and that

olution which is manifestly in the inter
est of clean sport."

resolution condemning proselyting, it
states in part, "That a committee of
nine, one from each district, be ap
pointed to deal with charges of prose
lyting or eligibility, each of these men
to acquaint himself with the eligibility
committees or arbitrators of the vari
ous conferences in his district, and also,
so far as possible, with the eligibility
authorities of the several institutions in
his district, not in organized confer
ences."
"Second, that a committee of three,
conveniently located geographically, be
named as a court of last resort for such
cases of proselyting or eligibility as are
not cleared up by the local conference
authorities or district representatives."
Professor Dubach of (). A. C. was ap
