# ENVIRONMENT AND ITS CHANGE OF CHARACTER IS THEME IN COMEDY
## 
### 
Masquer's comedy "Trelawney of the
Wells" stands out among theatrical pro
ductions for its all-star cast. Theatrical
life in England had suffered for some
time when Sir Arthur Wing Pinero
wrote his masterful humorous play for a
revival of dramatics. He chose for his
cast the leading actors and actresses of
England and gave a mid-Victorian time
to his comedy. By this unusual choice
of characters each member of the Mas
quer's cast will have equal chance to
demonstrate his dramatic ability.
The third act evolves theories dealing
with the powers of environment. The
dialogue, arranged in the clever and
witty composition of th eauthor, helps
in creating these situations.
Rose Trelawney returns to the Wells
Theatre after an escapade which ended
her stay at the home of Sir William
Cower, an eccentric old gentleman who
was trying to subsidize her, in order that
sh might be the right kind of a wife for
his grandson, Arthur Gower. A riotous
visit from the friends of her past was
directly responsible for her return to
the stage.
Her stay at the home of English
royalty had had its effect on the former
theatrical star in producing a sense of
refinment. In fact of this charge she
is no longer fit to resume her old place
at the Wells Theatre and is turned away
from the doors of her former habitat.
