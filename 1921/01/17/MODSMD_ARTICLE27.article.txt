I have often heard it said that wom
en lack interest in Varsity basketball.
This is easily understandable to any
one who has fought his way to a game
at the Encina Gym. Women, who
would like to be interested in basket
ball arrive at the Gym and lnd it filled
with men. They are obliged to fight
their way through the mob surround
ing the entrance, only to find that all the
seats are taken. If the woman is wise
she parks herself directly in front of
some tender-hearted man, who, seeing
the hopelessness of his situation, po
litely offers his seat that he may find a
better one. In the majority of cases,
however, tshe stands around until she
is quite disgusted with basketball and
vows "Never again.' l
This isn't as it should be. It seems
to me Stanford men should realize that
a woman can not hang from the raft
ers toy her eye-brows, thus getting an
excellent look at the game. Common
politeness would suggest that a few
gents do that, letting the women have
their scats.
Then take the queener. A brave man,
I call him. He fights through the crowd,
handicapped, as it were. He has to
protect his lady from the mob. He
tries to appear unconcerned under the
handed him, shouts of
"Queener!" etc. Imagine his feeling,
as well as that of the woman, on find
ing that there is no place for them.
Cannot some arrangement be made to
accommodate the women, thus stimu
lating interest in asketball, getting us
larger turn-outs to games'? The more
interest and enthusiasm in the game the
better teams will be turned out. Stan
ford's name will continue among the
first and best. Something should be
done to eliminate the necessity of mak
ing Stanford men show how thoroughly
ungentlemanly they can be by remain
ing seated while women stand.
