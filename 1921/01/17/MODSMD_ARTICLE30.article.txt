# KING, PIANIST, WILL APPEAR IN CONCERT WITH GRACE BECKER
## 
### 
Albert King, the young pianist, who,
with Miss Grace Becker, will appear in
a double concert tomorrow evening at
7:30 in the Little Theater, is considered
by many who have heard him one of
the most promising of the younger
virtuosos in the West. He is a young
Berkeley boy and has received his
musical education entirely in California.
He has concertized up and down the
coast this season, touring with Madame
Kolovo, the Russian violinist.
King appeared in a program at the
Community House in Palo Alto about
two months ago and gave a most satisfy
ing recital at that time. He is par
ticularly distinguished for his technical
skill and his playing is said to express
the sensibilities of an older and more
mature musician.
Miss Becker is a talented 'cellist and
is well known to musical audiences in
California and particularly around the
bay region, having appeared before
most of the musical clubs of San Fran
cisco. She is a member of the artists'
staff of the University of California
extension music department and is a
member of the Trio Moderne, consist
ing of harp, violin, and 'cello, which has
just returned from a three-weeks tour
of the state, appearing In over fifteen
concerts.
