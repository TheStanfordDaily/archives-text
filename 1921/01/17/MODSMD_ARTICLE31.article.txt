# Athletic Boom Aim Of Sequoia Smoker
## 
### 
Greater participation of Sequoia Hall
men in intercollegiate and intramural
athletics was the keynote of the first
smoker of the quarter held last night in
the little dormitory. The athletic spirit
was appealed to both by speeches and by
entertainment consisting of burlesque
contests, among them an indoor football
game.
A thorough canvass has been complet
ed of all lower division men in the hall,
and every one is listed for some com
petitve sport.
