# Palo Alto Council To Decennial Census Bill
## 
### 
It is the intention of the city council
of Palo Alto to appear before the state
legislature at Sacramento and request
the passage of a bill providing for a
state decennial census, commencing in
1925.
The recent federal census credited the
city with a population of 5900, while
authentic statistics in the hands of the
city health officer set the number at
6300; thus making the official record
about 500 short of the actual numbers.
