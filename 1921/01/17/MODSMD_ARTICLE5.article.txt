# STANFORD SOCCERITES TIE OLYMPICS IN GAME
## Stanford Varsity Leads Soccer League by Tying Olympics, Coach Maloney Is Pleased 
### 
Stanford practically cinched the cham
pionship of the University and Club
Soccer League on Saturday, when the
Stanford soccer team held the Olympic
Club to a 0-0 tie. It was a fine showing
that the Cardinal team made. Put up
against a heavier, bigger outfit, which
had been strengthened by the addition
of several Sunday League players, they
fought and succeeded in doing what
looked like the impossible.
"The best game I have ever seen the
team play," was Coach Harry Malonev's
verdict after the game, and added that
"the boys all played as a team窶馬ot just
as individuals." The odds were against
them before the game, as it looked as if
the stronger Olympic team had too much
the advantage in weight and size. Stan
ford again upset the dope.
The game was a fast one, at times
rather rough, but actual penalties were
few. There were no goal kicks from
the nenalty areas. Both teams were
eager to take the offense, and showed
plenty of* fight all through the game.
The superior condition of the Stanford
men showed in the way they rushed
the Olympics toward the last, and evi
dently if the game had been longer
the tie would have been broken. They
played the second half with as much
pep as the first, while the Winged O
players seemed to weaken toward the
last.
An outstanding feature of the game
was the large crowd that attended, and.
although the game was played in San
Francisco, the majority of the cheering
was for Stanford. As far as picking
out any individual stars on the team,
that is practically impossible, as the
smooth teamwork characterized the
game. The forward line showed im
mense improvement over early season
form, sticking together in a way that
had the Olympics guessing. The back
field, as it always has been, was right
on the job to block any attempts to
score.
The result of this tie game is that
Stanford now has an open field toward
first place honors. Three more games
remain to be played, and, barring in
jury or sickness, there is no reason why
they should not be won.
The frosh soccerites succeeded in
downing the boys from San Mateo High
School, about the same time, by the
score of 4 to 2. The high school team,
although fairly heavy, was new at the
game, and the frosh had little trouble
in penerating their defense. Poor
shooting was the only thing that kept
the score down. The play was slow and
somewhat rough, although the. frosh
forward line exhibited some pretty
passing at times.
The chances for a good team arc
greatly improved by the addition of
many new men. recently, the effect of
which will show itself as soon as they
have had a chance to get going.

The result of this tie game is that
Stanford now has an open field toward
first place honors. Three more games
remain to be played, and, barring in
jury or sickness, there is no reason why
they should not be won.
The frosh soccerites succeeded in
downing the boys from San Mateo High
School, about the same time, by the
score of 4 to 2. The high school team,
although fairly heavy, was new at the
game, and the frosh had little trouble
in penerating their defense. Poor
shooting was the only thing that kept
the score down. The play was slow and
somewhat rough, although the. frosh
forward line exhibited some pretty
passing at times.
The chances for a good team arc
greatly improved by the addition of
many new men. recently, the effect of
which will show itself as soon as they
have had a chance to get going.
Stanford practically cinched the cham
pionship of the University and Club
Soccer League on Saturday, when the
Stanford soccer team held the Olympic
Club to a 0-0 tie. It was a fine showing
that the Cardinal team made. Put up
against a heavier, bigger outfit, which
had been strengthened by the addition
of several Sunday League players, they
fought and succeeded in doing what
looked like the impossible.
"The best game I have ever seen the
team play," was Coach Harry Malonev's
verdict after the game, and added that
"the boys all played as a team窶馬ot just
as individuals." The odds were against
them before the game, as it looked as if
the stronger Olympic team had too much
the advantage in weight and size. Stan
ford again upset the dope.
The game was a fast one, at times
rather rough, but actual penalties were
few. There were no goal kicks from
the nenalty areas. Both teams were
eager to take the offense, and showed
plenty of* fight all through the game.
The superior condition of the Stanford
men showed in the way they rushed
the Olympics toward the last, and evi
dently if the game had been longer
the tie would have been broken. They
played the second half with as much
pep as the first, while the Winged O
players seemed to weaken toward the
last.
An outstanding feature of the game
was the large crowd that attended, and.
although the game was played in San
Francisco, the majority of the cheering
was for Stanford. As far as picking
out any individual stars on the team,
that is practically impossible, as the
smooth teamwork characterized the
game. The forward line showed im
mense improvement over early season
form, sticking together in a way that
had the Olympics guessing. The back
field, as it always has been, was right
on the job to block any attempts to
score.
