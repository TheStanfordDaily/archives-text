# ENTRANCE STANDARDS OPPOSED BY ALUMNI
## 
### 
Los Angeles alumni of Stanford
University have gone on record as
being opposed to the present policy
of admission in regard to entrance
requirement and tuition fees. Accord
ing to Herbert Marsliutz, prominent
alumni, the Los Angeles group wants
to see men with more 'red blood' in
them come to Stanford rather than
those whose qualifications are purely
scholastic.
The present requirements are bring
ing good brain material into the Uni
versity, but not equally good athletic
material, according to the Los Angeles
alumnus. A combination of brawn
and intelligence is what makes the
ideal college man. Graduates through
out the state are engaged in starting
a movement to alter some of these
requirements so that in the future
more red blooded men may gain ent
rance to the University.
In pursuance of their idea, the
alumni are planning to start a num
ber of regional scholarships, so that
by fall a man can be sent from each
district by each scholarship. The
alumni plan to co-operate with high
school principals in this work and will
pick the best all-around men far the
places.
