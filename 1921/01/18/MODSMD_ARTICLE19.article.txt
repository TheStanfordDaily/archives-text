school and made his first acquaintance
with natural historyj a study which was
later to bring him fame and recognition.
He attended the Academy at Warsaw
and entered Cornell in 1869. Here he con
tinued to show an aptitude for botany
and was made an instructor in the de
partment during his junior year. Fol
lowing his graduation in 1872 he was
made professor of natural history at
Lombard University.
In 1875 he was graduated in medicine
from the Indiana University. He rose to
the presidency here and later resigned
to become president of Stanford. In
1913 Dr. Jordan was made Chancellor of
the University, and in 1917 Chancellor
