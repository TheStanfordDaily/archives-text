# CAUSE FOR ACTION
## 
### 
The comparative price table presented on the first page today shows
the case that the residents of the Stanford campus have against the
merchants of Palo Alto. The prices shown have been carefully gath
ered by The Daily Palo Alto, and each claim made is substantiated by
evidence. Such discrimination against the people of Palo Alto and
Stanford has evidently been carried on for a long time, and while the
figures secured are only on groceries and meat, there is very little doubt
that the same condition exists in a number of other mercantile establish
ments in Palo Alto. Either the merchants conside Stanford students
their legitimate "meat" or they are under the impression that the stu
dents and faculty are fabulously wealthy and can afford to pay such
prices.
The fact remains that a good portion of the business of Palo Alto
is given over to supply the wants of the campus, and there is no apparent
reason for the merchants to charge higher prices than those of sur
rounding towns. Undoubtedly there has been trouble in the past with
unpaid fraternity accounts, and the merchants have had some cause for
raising the price level. But that condition has been largely remedied,
and if there are a few unpaid accounts existing on the campus, it is
certainly no excuse to charge the organizations that do pay their bills
prices from 6 to 7 per cent higher than those existing in surrounding
towns to cover tfie losses. Nearly every store of any size has the prob
lem of unpaid accounts to meet, but very few of them have taken the
same degree of protection that the merchants of Palo Alto have.
If he merchants have explanations to offer, this is the time to con
sider them. If they have no legitimate reasons, it is time that the
people of Palo Alto, who are fellow-sufferers, and the residents of the
Stanford cam(pus, unite to take some action to secure a level of prices
equaJ to that of nearby towns.
