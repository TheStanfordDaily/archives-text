# DR. JOHNSTON CAUSES GROWTH OF DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
Twenty-four years, with a policy of
guidance through personal contact, has
made many friends on the Stanford
campus for Dr. Oliver Martin Johnston
head of the Romanic Languages depart
ment.
Dr. Johnston has risen to his present
position in the face of difficulties. He
was born in Morehouse Parish, Louisi
ana, on a little farm, where he worked
until he was 18 years old. With scarcely
enough money to pay his board for a
month, he entered Mississippi College.
President S. C. Mitchell of the Univer
sity of South Carolina has written an
account of his struggles as a student,
entitled "The Will and the Way."
Immediately upon his graduation in
1890, he was made principal of the
preparatory department of the college.
The next year he was elected to the
chair of English. Refusing the offer of
the presidency, Dr. Johnston went to
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,
where he did graduate work in Romanic
languages for three years, winning a
$500 fellowship and later the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy. Meantime he
spent his summers in Europe, carrying
on special investigations in Italy and
France. He was instructor in French at
Bryn Mawr for one year and was called
to Stanford in 1897.
Since coming to Stanford, Dr. John
ston's interest has been equally divided
between research work and teaching,
since he believes that the one is an aid
to the other. His research has been prin
cipally along the line of philology,

early French literature and Dante. He
has been executive of the Department
of Romanic Languages since 1910 and
has brought about many changes in its
policies. Increased interest in French,
Spanish and Italian have brought about
a considerable growth in the depart
ment.
During the war Dr. Johnston was in
charge of the instruction in French at
Camp Fremont. He was also a member
of the Committee on Romanic. Lan
guage Instruction and the War, which
carried on its work in military camps
throughout the country.
Dr. Johnston was secretary of the
Philological Association of the Pacific
Coast from 1909 to 1913 and the presi
dent of that organization in 1917. He
was first vice-president of the Modern
Languages Association of America and
presided at its Yale meeting in 1917.
He has recently been informed of his
appointment as a member of the Dante
Memorial Association of One Hundred,
which is planning celebrations to com
memorate the six hundredth year after
the death of the Italian poet.
Since coming to Stanford he has made
several trips to Europe, the last one
being in 1914. He was in Paris when
the war broke out, but returned to this
country immediately afterward.
Dr. Johnston is another member of
the faculty who is intensely interested
in Stanford and everything that belongs
to Stanford. As such he wields a fine
influence for good in the University.
