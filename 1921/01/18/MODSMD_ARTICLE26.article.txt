# ARTISTS APPEAR IN CONCERT TONIGHT
## Grace Becker and Albert King to Play in Double Concert; Varied Program is Selected 
### 
Grace G. Becker, 'cellist, and Albert
King, pianist, who will give a double
concert this evening at 7:30 in the
Little Theater are both known to the
campus and Palo Alto community, and
the program tonight will be especially
interesting since it combines piano
and 'cello arrangements which will
show the artists at their best both to
those who have not as yet heard either
of the two artists, and to their form
e rhearers.
Miss Becker and her sister appear
ed here in a 'cello and violin program
about two years ago and will be re
membered by those who heard them
as giving a most enjoyable recital.
Since her introduction to San Fran
cisco musical circles by her teacher,
Herbert Riley, three years ago, Miss
Becker has become one of the best
known concert "cellists in San Fran
cisco and its vicinity, and has con
certized extensively in the State, ap
pearing in solo recitals and with the
Trio Moderne, composed of harp,
violin and 'cello. She was for some
time a pupil of Horace Britt, soloist
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, and is now studying with
Stanislaus Bern, master 'cellist, in pre
paration for a trip abroad for further
study.
The program which the two artists
have chosen for the recital this even
ing contains selections from a num
ber of well-known maatere and most
of the numbers are more or less
familiar ones. The entire program
will be as follows:
I. Sonata, for 'cello and piano
