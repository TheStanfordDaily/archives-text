<$> T. 1., '23 <§>
Time for ye ed. to hit the Blue
Laws a rap or two. Fearful of in
citing serition in the ranks he hath
abstained from mentioning that pro
posed law which comes as a culmina
tion of the acts of ye reformer. But
now that the Congresswomen are giv
ing the azure statutes a ride, ye ed.
can't keep his pen off.

The leader of the reform movement
says he doesn't want new laws passed,
but just wants the old ones enforced.
Among those that would be enforced
would be the government regulation
of the length of bed sheets. That one
was probably passed during a linen
shortage. Yet, it ought to be carried
into effect.

One old state statute makes it a
misdemeanor to leave the blinds up.
We wonder if that applies to horses
as well. No provision is made for
glass houses.
The law is even written in one state
prohibiting bells on domestic animals
on Sunday. What would Santa Claus
do on a Sunday Christmas in that
state —muffle the reindeer's music?
The only way for sheepherders to get
around that one would be to equip
their flocks with compressed air
whistles, or attach a portable phono
graph with a bell record on it, to
the leader's neck.

Reading the Daily top column wa
find that Dr. Jordan has just cele
brated his "seventieth birth." Some
thing to celebrate, we'll say. Funny
face says that beats a cat all hollow.
"R. W. Kenny sails for European
port"—Daily headline. Why not add
Burgundy and other beverage atop
overs?
