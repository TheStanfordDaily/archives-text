# DELTA CHI DEFEATED BY PHI DELTA THETA IN INTRAMURAL GAME
## 
### 
Another victory was scored by the
Phi Delta Theta quintet yesterday after
noon when the Delta Chi five was
beaten 16 to 9. The game was a keen
contest, and though the Delta Chi men
were never able to overcome their
opponents' lead, they fough hard
throughout the game.
Coplen starred for the Delta Chis,
scoring all of their nine points. He was
supported by Tritle, Conard, Taylor and
Winship. Clark and Pigott were the
leading point winners for the Phi Delta
Theta team. Fletcher, at center, played
a strong game, and Wrenn and Aubert
kept the Lawyers' score down by their
defensive work. The first half ended
with the Phi Delta Thetas in the lead,
9-5.
The other two games on the League
Six schedule for yesterday were for
feited. The Chinese Club defaulted to
the Beta Theta Pi, and the Off-Campus
five was awarded a 2-0 decision over the
Military Detachment when the latter
failed to appear.

The teams of League Four play their
third round this afternoon.
Tomorrow the Japanese Club will
clash with the Theta Chi quintet. Intra
mural dopesters predict a fast and clever
contest, for though the Japanese goal
shooters have lost both their games,
gymnasium gossip credits them with
playing some of the best ball yet seen
in the campus series. The Theta Chis
are leading the second league, being the
only quintet in that league which has
not been defeated.
