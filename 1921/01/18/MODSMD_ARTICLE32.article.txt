## 
### 
Rugby will soon be listed among
Stanford's intramural sports, according
to Coach Harry Maloney. A meeting of
all men interested in an intramural
rugby tournament has been called by
Maloney. The meeting will take place ar
4 o'clock Wednesday afternoon in the
lecture room in Encina Gymnasium.
Present plans are to start a series of
rugby games among campus organiza
tions at once. An award will probably
be given to the winning team. Whether
the ward will be a "feed" or a trophy
will be decided by the Physical Educa
tion Department.
Maloney asserted that a great inter
est in rugby has been shown on the
campus. The intramural tournament
plan is the result of this interest and
will give rugby enthusiasts a chance
to work out during the winter and
spring quarters.
Maloney hopes to discover some good
material for next year's team, which
will make the usual trip to Canada next
year to play at Victoria and Vancouver
during the Christmas holidays.
"The northern trip is a valuable asset
in preserving and developing the splen
did relations between Stanford and the
Canadian colleges," said Maloney. "The
Northerners look forward to our com
ing and treat us like brothers. I never
have experienced such cordiality in my
life as they showed us up there—
never!"
