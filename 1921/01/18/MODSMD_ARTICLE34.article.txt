# LOUIS GRAVEURE, BELGIAN BARITONE, TO GIVE CONCERT THURSDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Louis Graveure, the noted Belgian
baritone, who is to be presented b>
I" rank W. Healy Thursday night in the
second concert of the Healy series, is
known as a brilliant, sensitive, eloquent
and amiable concert artist. Graveure's is
a distinct personality. His appearance,
with his heavy beard and his stocky
physique, add to the dramatic effect of
his songs. His stage poise is considered
an art in itself. He seems no more con
cerned when he walks out on the stage
than he would be walking into his own
drawing room from the street. He is
perfectly at ease, and puts his audience
equally at ease. His apparent friendli
ness is one of the unusual things noticed
in all his concerts. He makes his audi
ence feel that he has known each and
every one for years. There is a famil
iarity about an evening when Graveure
sings that one seldom feels in the con
cert hall.
Beginning his career as a painter, Mr.
Graveure naturally has the artistic in
stinct in regard to dressing. Many
critics have called him a truly pic
turesque personality. For years the stage
has been the center of attraction in all
that is artistic in dress and costume, for
the actor and actress must dress the part
as well as play it. The concert stage is
one place where clothes count as well as
voice, and to know what to wear and
how to wear it is half the concert
singer's success.
Few singers on the concert stage pos
sess a more striking appearance than
Graveure. The moment he steps on the
stage the audience gazes on an inter
esting personality of force and confi
dence, and before he has uttered a
word his audience is with him. He has
learned the art of dress and he is a man
who can display clothes to their best
advantage. He not only has the build
of an atldete, but he is an athlete. His
eye is clear, his step springy, and his
head and shoulders erect. His neatly
trimmed beard also adds to the appear
ance of the singer.
