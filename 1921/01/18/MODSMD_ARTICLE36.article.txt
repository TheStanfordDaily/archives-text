GENE, Jan. 18.â€”Eighteen students were
dropped from the university and 126
others were put on probation during the
winter for failure to measure up to the
higher scholarship standards, which, ac
cording to Carlton Spencer, registrar,
arc higher this year than formerly. Out
of the total on probation, 50 per cent
of them are freshmen. Special consid
eration is given a student if it is thought
that a second chance would better his
scholarship.
Of the eighteen who were dismissed,
ten were on probation last term for poor
work during the spring term of last
year, and eight failed to make good
with a second chance and were conse
quently dropped.
