# MASQUERS' LEADS UNUSUALLY CLEVER
## Beatrice Edmonds Charming in Part of Rose Trelawney; Wilson Acts With Sincerity 
### 
Beatrice playing Rose
Trelawney in "Trelawney of the
Wells," comedy to be produced by the
Masquers, next Friday evening in the
Assembly Hall, is showing remark
ably fine work in rehearsals. Miss
Edmonds is well fitted for her part
and demonstrates excellent talent for
amateur work. Her beautiful voice
adds much to her acting, and with it
she runt a tremendous rauge, clever
ly changing from the most subtle com
edy parts of her character to the
scenes of deepest pathos.
In the first part of the play. Rose
Trelawney is the regular type of mid-
Victorian actress, foolish, but yet
modest. Later in the drama we find
her a refined, mild and sweet young
lady. The part calls for extraordinary
characterization and Miss Edmond's
talent is fully called into play in the
Marquers' production.
Gowns to be worn by Miss Edmonds
are being made and will be used in
the Pinero production for the first
time. They are patterned from the
sensationel and popular play, Drink
water "Lincoln" which is now playing
in New York.
Howard Wilson, as Arthur Gower,
playing opposite Miss FJdmonds, plays
his part with marked sincerity and
poise. Gower is a young lover and he
loves the actress regardless of the
dislike of his grandparents. This will
be Wilson's first appearance in cam
pus dramatics and from all indications
his "debut" will be a credit to him.
Mixed with the enthusiastic actors
of the age, playing at the Wells, Pi
nero has brought in two characters
of "the old time school." In the char
acter he has named Mr. and Mrs. Tel
fer, the parts are handled by James
Anglim and Virginia Lowers. This is
their first appearance on the cam
pus stage. In the earlier part of the
comedy we find them yet popular, but
slowly dying. Finally they are "placed
on the shelf" and their realization of
thte "passing of a perfect day" is both
pathetic and humorous.
The ticket drawing showed that
much interest is being taken in the
Masquers' first stage production today.
Although mauy good seats can still be
obtained, indications point to a full
house for the production. The cur
tain next Friday night will raise
promptly at 8:15 o'clock. This was
started at the play "Wedding Bolls"
and consequently many were not seat
ed when the show began.
