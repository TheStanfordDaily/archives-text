Palo Alto prices are 7.9 per cent higher than Redwood City; 6.7 per cent
higher than San Jose, and about 7 per cent higher than San Francisco.

Palo Alto stores are charging higher
prices for groceries, meat and other
merchandise than those of surround
ing towns and cities. This discovery
is the result of an investigation that
the Daily Palo Alto has been carrying
on for the past week.
Palo Alto prices on the goods li3t.ed
above, which may be considered rep
resentative. average 7.9 per cent high
er than those of Redwood City, 6.7
per cent higher than those of San
Jose and about '7 per cent higher than
those of San Francisco.
Campus house managers at a meet
ing last night, after studying the
Daily Palo Alto chart, agreed to take
immediate action to endeavor to re
duce prices in Palo Alto to the level
of those in surrounding towns, and
appointed a commitee for that pur
pose. The members are A. W. Taylor,
'22, P. F. Campbell, '20, and A. B.
McAlpine, '23. They will present
their case to the Palo Alto merchants
and Chamber of Commerce and if
nothing is done to improve conditions,
will arrange to buy elsewhere.
In carrying on the investigation,

prices were sccured under the same
circumstances and from representative
stores in each case. The figures
given are these at which the goods
are sold over the counter to retail
customers.
San Francisco firms make deliveries
to the campus once a week and make
daily deliveries in San Francisco.
Redwood City stores deliver free in
their own territory and make no extra
charge for delivering large orders to
outside points. Concerns in San Jose
make a nominal charge for campus
deliveries.
All these merchants allow discounts
for large and regular orders and allow
credit to any individual or group with
an established reliable reputation.
The prices were all secured at
practically the same time and the
prices of the different stores in each
town averaged. The variation in the
selling price of Campbell's Soups, a
standard product, possibly shows the
difference most clearly.
The Daily Palo Alto has evidence
to substantiate all figures.

appointed a commitee for that pur
pose. The members are A. W. Taylor,
'22, P. F. Campbell, '20, and A. B.
McAlpine, '23. They will present
their case to the Palo Alto merchants
and Chamber of Commerce and if
nothing is done to improve conditions,
will arrange to buy elsewhere.
In carrying on the investigation,

prices were sccured under the same
circumstances and from representative
stores in each case. The figures
given are these at which the goods
are sold over the counter to retail
customers.
San Francisco firms make deliveries
to the campus once a week and make
daily deliveries in San Francisco.
Redwood City stores deliver free in
their own territory and make no extra
charge for delivering large orders to
outside points. Concerns in San Jose
make a nominal charge for campus
deliveries.
All these merchants allow discounts
for large and regular orders and allow
credit to any individual or group with
an established reliable reputation.
The prices were all secured at
practically the same time and the
prices of the different stores in each
town averaged. The variation in the
selling price of Campbell's Soups, a
standard product, possibly shows the
difference most clearly.
The Daily Palo Alto has evidence
to substantiate all figures.
