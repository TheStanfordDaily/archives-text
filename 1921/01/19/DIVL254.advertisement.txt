Carter DeHaven, who so successful
ly registers intoxication as the tem
peramental Signor Monti, in his own
film version of "Twin Beds," has had
the benefit of vast experience in de
picting gentlemen who have imbibed
not wisely but well. In one of his
first starring vehicles of the speaking
stage, "The Girl in the Taxi," Mr. De-
Haven staggered convincingly about
the stage for four hundred and fifty
rip.hts, until he began to feel that he
had been an inebriate from birth. Fol
lowed^then several vaudeville sketches
and a number of screen comedies, In
all of which Mr. DeHaven was at one
time or another discovered in a reel
ing§condition.
Report has it that in "Twin Beds,"
Mr. DeHaven has eclipsed all his pre
vious comedy successes, and has made
Signor Monto one of the most laugh
provoking characters that was ever
flashed upon the silversheet. Great
things were prophesied for Mr. De-
Haven's production, and from all ac
counts, it has justified every predic
tion that it would be one of the sea
son's great successes. "Twin Beds"
will be the Associate First National
attraction at the Stanford Theater,
today for the last time.
