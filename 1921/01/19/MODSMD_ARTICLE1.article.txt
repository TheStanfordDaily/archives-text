# DR. JORDAN, "GRAND OLD MAN" OF THE UNIVERSITY REACHES SEVENTY YEARS
## CHANCELLOR EMERITUS DENIES THE STATEMENT OF MARK TWAIN THAT THIS IS AGE TO BE MUSTERED OUT 
### Wylie Kilpatrick, '23 
"I reach the age of seventy years,"
said David Starr Jordan in an inter
view yesterday, "the age at which Mark
Twain says a man is 'mustered out,'
having no further responsibility in the
world and 'not caring what anybody
may say about him,' is left perfectly
free to say whatever he pleases about
anybody else. Rut I do not find it neces
sary to be mustered out. I have just as
much to do as I ever had and just as
much desire to do it, and that fact, with
a cheerful outlook on the world, is a
natural product of good health, a bless
ing which has been, mine for the last
seventy years.
"I have, moreover, the gratis blessing
of a most devoted and helpful critic,
and as James Stephens observes: 'The
man who marries a university girl has
always thereafter a critic on the
hearth.'"
Varied has been the life of the man
who Stanford today honors on the anni
versary of his birthday. Though accus
tomed to thinking of him as the first
president of the University, the Stan
ford community realizes that a career
of seventy years has carried him into
many phases of American endeavor and
achievement. "In these seventy years I
have lived three separate lives, each one
full of joy to me. I was by training and
by choice a naturalist and explorer, by
choicc and also-by training a teacher,
and afterwards administrator, and
through the blunders of world politics j
I became a minor apostle of democracy,
In each of these lines I have had my
satisfaction. The last one has not al
ways enhanced my vogue, but as I have
said sometimes, I never went out of my
way <Vne inch to court popularity with
either man or beast.'
"It has been my fortune to study as a
naturalist a large part of the world,
Dr. Jordan said, "and at the same time
to become acquainted with all kinds of
people, 40 that perhaps no one living
knows more individual persons than 1.

I have said sometimes that I now have
met everybody on earth except a few
kings, and the need of making their
acquaintance grows fortunately less day
by day."
As a publicist and leader of political
thought the name of David Starr Jordan
has been intimately associated with
movements aiming at the healthy func
tioning of American democracy in its
domestic and international problems.
"In public affairs it has been my duty,"
continued Dr. Jordan, "to serve the gov
ernment on several international high
commissions, and this has enabled me to
get a pretty definite idea of the work
ings of administration in this and other
countries. It has intensified my belief'
that is the most backward
of all human enterprises, and that the
only way out toward good government
and administration in the interests of
the people is through democracy, while
democracy can demand good go\*ern
ment only as its units arc educated.
Therefore, increase of knowledge and
increase of the feeling of responsibility
are essential features in the growth of
democracy.
"The overshadowing question of
world peace and the abolition of armies
and armament is in itself only a phase
of democracy. Nothing constructive can
be accomplished by force or terrorism,
and democracy begins where enforced
01 der leaves off." -

The future is not as dark as some
cynical observers would have us be
lieve, iti the opinion of the Chancellor
Emeritus, tor he declares that "though
keeping as keen an eye as I can on the
defects of today, I have the greatest
faith in the ultimate future. Man is so
built that he cannot be satisfied without
freedom, order and justice, and the way
to these lies through friendliness and
conciliation. Patriotism is not merely
100 per cent American, but 100 per cent
human, for nothing can be good for
our own nation which is harmful to
some other. That our own nation
realizes this better than most of the
others is our good fortune. The achieve
ments we have made in the direction of
education, democracy, and public wel
fare are enormous, and will go on in
spite of the backsets and eddies which
always occur in the affairs of a free
people.
"This is our Christmas card for the
year:
"1851-1921
"Lord, here am I! My threc-score years
and ten
All counted to the full; I've fought Thy
fight,
Crossed Thy dark valleys, scaled Thy
rocks' harsh height,
Borne all Thy burdens Thou dost lay on
men
With hand unsparing, three-score years
and ten.
Before Thee now I make my claim, O
Lord!
What shall I pray Thee as a meet re
ward?
I ask for nothing! Let the balance fall!
All that I am or know or may confess
But swells the weight of mine indebted
ness;
Burdens and sorrows stands transfigured
all;
Thy hand's rude buffet turns to a caress,
For Love, with all the rest, Thou gav'st
me here,
And Love is Heaven's very atmos
phere !"
