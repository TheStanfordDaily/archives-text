# CARDINAL FIVE PLAYS COLLEGE OF PACIFIC TONIGHT
## Methodist Tossers Have Won From Olympic and Expect to Give Locals a Battle 
### 
Stanford will meet the basketball
team of the College of the Pacific to
night in Encina Gymnasium at 8:15
o clock. I his is, on its face, an easy
contest, but the Methodist five may
spring a big surprise, as they defeated
the Olympic Club recently, and the
Olympics were only beaten by Stanford
by six points.
Coach George Sperry has evidently
drilled a fast team to represent the Col
lege of the Pacific in the California-
Nevada League, and if Stanford is to
maintain its present unblemished record
in that organization it will have to beat
this quintet decisively.

This is the last preliminary game be
fore the opening of the Conference
schedule, and it is the desire of the
Stanford five to go into the Conference
with a clean sheet. The first two games
in the "big league" are to be played on
next Tuesday and Wednesday with the
Oregon Aggies here.

Coach Powell has commended the
action of the spectators in the last game
in discontinuing the practice of tossing
pennies for the kids to fight over. Powell
explains that because of the rapidity of
play it is a real danger to the players
to have small coins lying 011 the floor,
as a slip upon one of them might result
in a bad spill and unfortunate injuries
that would cripple the victim. It also
cuts the floor up badly and is a cheap
form of amusement that could well be
done away with.
Mills will start tonight's game at cen
ter, with Righter and Davies in the for
ward line and Richmond and Adams
doing the guarding.

Preceding the varsity game the fresh
man five will tangle with the Oakland
•Technical High School. This game is
scheduled to begin at 7.

The admission charge will be 50 cents
to outsiders. Student body card holders
and holders of season tickets will be
admitted free.
