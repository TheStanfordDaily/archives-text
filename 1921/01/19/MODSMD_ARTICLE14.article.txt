# CONCERT PROGRAM TO INCLUDE WIDE VARIETY OF SONGS
## Graveure, Noted Baritone, to Sing in Recital Tomorrow, Seat Sale Is Continued 
### 
The program which will be given by
Louis Graveure at his concert in the
Assembly Hall tomorrow evening is
unusual in the variety of numbers which
it includes and in the nature of the
songs themselves. Most of them are not
well known and have a popular rather
than a classical appeal. Frank W. Mealy,
under whose management the concert is
to be given, has announced that it is
quite possible that the program may not
please some of the entirely classical
music followers, but that he is confident
that when even they hear the program
which Graveure has selected they will
not only thoroughly enjoy it, but criticize
it favorably.
Graveure arrived in San Francisco
last week and appeared in a recital in
the Scottish Rite Auditorium in San
Francisco last evening. His present
California tour is the beginning of a
journey which will carry him prac
tically around the world, for he will
leav'c the first part of June for a tour of
Europe which will include Norway.
