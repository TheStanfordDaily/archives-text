# "JORDAN DAY"
## 
### 
The Jordan Club lias established a Stanford tradition in instituting
"Jordan Day," which should be observed unfailingly by all future gen
erations of Stanford students. David Starr Jordan, first President, and
Chancellor Emeritus of the University, holds a place in the memory of
Stanford people second only to the Founders, and it is fitting that the
anniversary of his day of birth should be observed.
The present students have had little opportunity to come into con
tact with Dr. Jordan, but the opportunities that have been given fully
verify the praises that are sung of him by those Stanford men and
women who have known Dr. Jordan as President of the University.
Since his retirement, Dr. Jordan's record has been one of active partici
pation in educational, scientific, and national endeavors, all of which
has made him one of the biggest men in the West and one of the best
known and respected in the nation. The position that Stanford Uni
versity occupies in the educational field is sufficient testimony of Dr.
Jordan's work as the first President and organizer, and as he lives to
look back upon his seventieth birthday anniversary, Dr. Jordan will be
able to mark the amazing growth of the University which he organized,
as Stanford men and women will similarly record the inevitable wide
spread increase in the fame and influence of the Chancellor Emeritus.
