# PALO ALTO AID NEEDED
## 
### 
Campus organizations have nearly unanimously fallen in behind
the effort to secure a lower level of prices, as the signatures to the agree
ment appearing" in the news columns today and the expressions of ap
proval received from the Palo Alto people testify. This campaign need
not stop with the residents of the Stanford campus. The high prices
existing in Palo Alto affect the people of Palo Alto equally as much as
the campus residents, and there is nothing to prevent them from lend
ing their influence in securing better conditions. This high level must
have been in effect for years, and if it really exists, and the merchants
cannot offer a reasonable explanation, the people of Palo Alto and Stan
ford are many dollars loser on their foodstuffs.
Prices in general are declining all over the country, but the figures
gathered by The Daily Palo Alto show that the Palo Alto merchants
have granted just enough decreases to keep in line with the general
movement, but still maintain a level higher than that of nearby towns.
There is no doubt that this condition should be remedied, and by
the united efforts of the residents of Palo Alto and Stanford, some sort
of satisfactory agreement can be reached with the merchants.
