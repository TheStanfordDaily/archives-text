# DR. J. E. COOVER SAYS DICE HAVE HELPED PSYCHOLOGY
## 
### 
With the desire to disseminate
sound psychology to his students and
to extend such knowledge by research;
as his dominant motives, Dr. John Ed
gar Coover has devoted his time to
the Psychology department and especi
ally to psychical research since 1912.
Dr. Coover is another example of the
Stanford men who has returned to the
University as a professor.
Dr. Coover was born in Remington,
Indiana. His elementary education
was obtained in Pennsylvania and in
Kansas, subject to the irregularities
of competing duties on a farm. After
a term in McPherson College he went
to Colorado and sought employment
as a telegraph operator. But the panic
of '92 was in prospect and corpora
tions were laying off men. He then
determined to follow out his old aim
of preparing to teach, and laid plans
to enter the State Normal School at
Greeley. These plans were twice
wrecked, first by an accident that
transferrel his savings earned on a
ranch to a surgeon and a boarding
house; next by the bankruptcy of his
employer who was also his banker.
But with his undrawn salary he leased
his employer's plant and thus accumu
lated a third stake by editing and pub
lishing "The Longmont Progress,"
that enabled him, after three years
of effort, to enter the Normal.
Here he studied four years, earning
his way as assistant librarian and
secretary to the president, becoming
editor-in-chief of the school magazine,
and finally receiving the degree of
bachelor of pedagogy. On leaving the
Normal he became principal of the
Como schools, a position he resigned
to enter Stanford in 1899.
It was in a class at Normal School
that Dr. Coover discovered that there
was some fault in the method of the
teaching of psychology and he resolved
there to root out the trouble. This
he found through his studies in the
Departments of Philosophy and Psy
chology, and in courses by Royce and
Palmer of Harvard at U. C. summer
sessions. He received an A.8., in
philosophy in 1904 and an A.M. in
psychology in 1905. Dr. Coover was
still earning his own way, first as a
printer and pressman and later as
manager of the Western Union tele
graph and long distance telephone
office formerly located in the cam
pus post office.
On leaving Stanford Dr. Coover ac
cepted the principalship of the Sonora
High School for two years. Three
more years were spent as principal of
the Dixon Union High School, and
in 1910 Dr. Coover returned to Stan
ford as an assistant in the Psychology
department. He received a Ph.D. in
1912, and was appointed to his pres
ent position as assistant professor of
psychology and fellow in psychical re
search.
During the war Dr. Coover was
commissioned a captain in the Sani
tary Corps. He was located on Long
Island in the Medical Research Labo
ratories. The psychological section
was the headquarters for perfecting
the "re-breather" tests, sent out psy
chologists to flying fields to make the
tests and trained flight surgeons in

psychology. Dr. Coover assisted in
this routine, introducing statistical
methods of treatment of the data col
lected by the section, and worked on
special researches. He is at present
occupied in preparing a report in col
laboration with Professor Stratton of
the University of California, Profes
sor McComus of Princeton, and Pro
fessor Bagby of Yale on the results of
experiments to discover psychological
tests will will diagnose the capacity
of a cadet before he undergoes train
ing in flight.
Dr. Coover is the author of several
monographs and of a number of con
tributions to professional journals.
He is a member of the scientific hon
or society, Sigma Xi, and various pro
fessional organizations.
He denies that the roulette wheel in
his attic reflects any discredit on
Monte Carlo, and suggests that we
owe out statistical methods to the
bounties settled upon mathematicians
by "gentlemen of fortune" who sought
laws by which they might win the
fickle goddess. He thinks a prerequi
site to psychophysics is an intimate
acquaintance with such lowly ap
paratus as coins, cards, and dice. The
theory of probability and "least
squares," he says, "follow naturally."
Among the various researches he
i has under way are the effect of sub
liminal stimuli upon conscious pro
cesses and the sensori motor process
of typing.
The result of the main line of work
which Dr. Coover has done in physical
research in the University is embodi
ed in a monograph called "Experi
ments in Psychical Research," giving
some unusual illustrations in which
type was set by himself.

With the desire to disseminate
sound psychology to his students and
to extend such knowledge by research;
as his dominant motives, Dr. John Ed
gar Coover has devoted his time to
the Psychology department and especi
ally to psychical research since 1912.
Dr. Coover is another example of the
Stanford men who has returned to the
University as a professor.
Dr. Coover was born in Remington,
Indiana. His elementary education
was obtained in Pennsylvania and in
Kansas, subject to the irregularities
of competing duties on a farm. After
a term in McPherson College he went
to Colorado and sought employment
as a telegraph operator. But the panic
of '92 was in prospect and corpora
tions were laying off men. He then
determined to follow out his old aim
of preparing to teach, and laid plans
to enter the State Normal School at
Greeley. These plans were twice
wrecked, first by an accident that
transferrel his savings earned on a
ranch to a surgeon and a boarding
house; next by the bankruptcy of his
employer who was also his banker.
But with his undrawn salary he leased
his employer's plant and thus accumu
lated a third stake by editing and pub
lishing "The Longmont Progress,"
that enabled him, after three years
of effort, to enter the Normal.
Here he studied four years, earning
his way as assistant librarian and
secretary to the president, becoming
editor-in-chief of the school magazine,
and finally receiving the degree of
bachelor of pedagogy. On leaving the
Normal he became principal of the
Como schools, a position he resigned
to enter Stanford in 1899.
It was in a class at Normal School
that Dr. Coover discovered that there
was some fault in the method of the
teaching of psychology and he resolved
there to root out the trouble. This
he found through his studies in the
Departments of Philosophy and Psy
chology, and in courses by Royce and
Palmer of Harvard at U. C. summer
sessions. He received an A.8., in
philosophy in 1904 and an A.M. in
psychology in 1905. Dr. Coover was
still earning his own way, first as a
printer and pressman and later as
manager of the Western Union tele
graph and long distance telephone
office formerly located in the cam
pus post office.
On leaving Stanford Dr. Coover ac
cepted the principalship of the Sonora
High School for two years. Three
more years were spent as principal of
the Dixon Union High School, and
in 1910 Dr. Coover returned to Stan
ford as an assistant in the Psychology
department. He received a Ph.D. in
1912, and was appointed to his pres
ent position as assistant professor of
psychology and fellow in psychical re
search.
During the war Dr. Coover was
commissioned a captain in the Sani
tary Corps. He was located on Long
Island in the Medical Research Labo
ratories. The psychological section
was the headquarters for perfecting
the "re-breather" tests, sent out psy
chologists to flying fields to make the
tests and trained flight surgeons in

psychology. Dr. Coover assisted in
this routine, introducing statistical
methods of treatment of the data col
lected by the section, and worked on
special researches. He is at present
occupied in preparing a report in col
laboration with Professor Stratton of
the University of California, Profes
sor McComus of Princeton, and Pro
fessor Bagby of Yale on the results of
experiments to discover psychological
tests will will diagnose the capacity
of a cadet before he undergoes train
ing in flight.
Dr. Coover is the author of several
monographs and of a number of con
tributions to professional journals.
He is a member of the scientific hon
or society, Sigma Xi, and various pro
fessional organizations.
He denies that the roulette wheel in
his attic reflects any discredit on
Monte Carlo, and suggests that we
owe out statistical methods to the
bounties settled upon mathematicians
by "gentlemen of fortune" who sought
laws by which they might win the
fickle goddess. He thinks a prerequi
