R. W. K., once conductor of Cab
bages, writes from N.Y. that good
stuff can be purchased for $8:80 per
liter and everybody tries to sell you
some. Says the barbers don't try to
sell you a tonic or a shampoo with
a haircut, but try to market some rye
instead, and assume the customary
peeved attitude if you refuse to buy.

Old gent to ditto, taking drink of
whisky—That stuff will ruin your
stomach.
Second ditto—That's all right. It
doesn't show with your clothes on,

Examiner reports that a guy back
in Kansas exhorted his family to put
up a spacious tomb when he kicked
off, equip it with electric lights and
put an issue of his favorite paper in
it every day for twenty years. If he
doesn't have them omit the Sunday
supplements, he'd better have a ware
house built over his remains.
This Kansas bird is supposed to be
rather eccentric. He isn't. He just
wants to delicately express his opinion
that his favorite paper, by its own
merits, Is meant for association with
the defunct.

Reports have it that the California
"Pelican" has been clipped—shorn of
its feathers as it were. Next thing
we know, censors will be uprooting
the Chaparral or exposing the Pic
torial. Editorial comment on Illust
