# SOCCER VARSITY MEETS PALO ALTO LEGION SATURDAY
## 
### 
I The next game on Stanford's soccer
; schedule will be with the American
' Legion team of Palo Alto, next Sat
urday. The game will be played on
I the local field, if weather conditions
j* permit.
This game is one of the regular
[ league games, end counts with the
• others in the race for the flag. The
£ Legion has put out a good team and
• one that will make the Cardinals work
• hard to win.
I The tie game with the Olympic
I Club last Saturday was the event that
• put joy into the hearts of the Cardinal
! rooters. Stanford by virtue of that
' tie, is still in first place, and unless
i the unexpected happens, should win
. the remaining three games, thus giv
' ing the other contenders no chance.
• Freshman soccer prospects have
' come out of the fog that enveloped
; them in the beginning of the quarter,
• when no one could tell for a while
• whether or not the team would still
• be intact, and a schedule of games has
\ been partly formed.
) The next game the freshmen have
• is with San Mateo High School, next
\ Saturday, on the field here. In the
' middle of next week they will test
• out their strength with the Palo Alto
\ eleven. These games, of course, may
; not be played unless the weather
» clears sufficiently for the field to be
| in shape. A wet and muddy field takes
; all the action out of a soccer game,
• especiall as the ball is continually
) in action and it is essentially an
open-field, running and kicking game.
