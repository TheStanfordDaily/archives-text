# Stranger Sleeps in Other Twin Bed, Wife Wild!
## 
### 
If you are loving wife, and if you
discovered a man other than your hus
band right in your bedroom, in fact,
right in the other one of your twin
beds, what would you do?
That's exactly what happened to
Mrs. Harry Hawkins and she expected
her husband to walk in any minute,
too.
Mr. Hawkins had gone out early in
the evening on business and his wife
had retired at her usual hour, without
a sign of anything amiss. Imagine her
dismay when on awakening and trip
ping blithely over to wake hubby, she
beheld another man, wearing her hus
band's pa.iamas and a high silk hat!
Report has it that Mrs. Hawkins
became terrified at the moment by the
entrance of her husband. However,
you can discover in what manner she
handled the situation when you see
the screaming bed-room farce, "Twin
Beds," which Mr. and Mrs. Carter De-
Haven are presenting in picture form,
at the Stanford Theater, today and
tomorrow, as the latent First National
attraction.
