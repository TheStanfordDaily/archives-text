### 
Second round of the handball tour
nament, from which a team will be
picked to represent Stanford in all
future games, will be played at the
Peninsula Club tomorrow night. This
round will be the final tryouts for
the team.
Those who have remained in the
eliminating rounds are Colvin Rutter,
Koba, Cohen, Lowenstein and San
some. This year's handball prospects
are very good. The material that has
tried out has been the best, and keen
competition has been evident in the
tryouts.
