# "EUROPE IS IN NEED OF BREAD" SAYS S. G. EDDY
## Asks Audience to Heed H. C. Hoover's Appeal for Food For the Starving Countries 
### 
I'read, peace, and God were declared
to be the three prime needs of the world
at the present moment by Sherwood
Eddy in his address at the assembly
this morning. He declared that every
country of Europe which he visited
since the signing of the armistice was
faced by a great national crisis—either
a war, strike, famine, or revolution.
Eddy described conditions in the vari
ous countries which he visited. The
speaker paid a tribute to Herbert
Hoover for his work in Poland in re
lieving the situation by carrying 011 the
work of feeding 1,000,000 children. He
said:
"There is 110 man in Etfropc or in all
the world who came out of the war who
has done more for humanity than a
Stanford man, Herbert Hoover."
In southern Russia, the speaker said,
he witnessed much distress among the
refugees of the army of General
Wrangel. He told of seeing great masses
of humanity piled together in boats.

The condition of the students and
professors in Vienna were said to be
serious. The annual salary of a professor
is sufficient to buy himself and family 1
an outfit of clothing, but there is no
money left with which to purchase
clothing. Students are forced to do any
kind of work they can find in order to
exist. Eddy urged his hearers to "take
the challenge of Herbert Hoover and
give $10 to keep a student alive. It not
only saves his life, but does much for
the whole student body."
"The world needs peace. National
racial and class strife are dominant in
the wrfrld. Every nation is demanding
self-determination, whether suited for it
or not. Class strife, the toiling masses
of the poor claiming their rights, is the
most serious kind of conflict.
"The significance of this situation is
that we arc now passing through the
greatest era of transition the world has
ever known. As great changes came
after the French revolution, so will
democracy finally emerge triumphant
when this decade is over."
"The desire of people for democracy,
though stifled for a thousand years, will
eventually assert itself. If this does not
come about through evolution people
will resort to revolution to bring it
about."
In England, Eddy said that changes
have recently been brought about by
evolution. Capital and labor lra.ve come
together to settle their differences by
submitting their disputes to a council
[composed of representatives of both fac
tions. This has proved an effective
means of preventing strikes, he said.
Dr. Jordan, who introduced the
speaker, was given a big ovation, the
occasion being his seventieth birthday.
Eddy spoke at a faculty luncheon fol
lowing the assembly.

I'read, peace, and God were declared
to be the three prime needs of the world
at the present moment by Sherwood
Eddy in his address at the assembly
this morning. He declared that every
country of Europe which he visited
since the signing of the armistice was
faced by a great national crisis—either
a war, strike, famine, or revolution.
Eddy described conditions in the vari
ous countries which he visited. The
speaker paid a tribute to Herbert
Hoover for his work in Poland in re
lieving the situation by carrying 011 the
work of feeding 1,000,000 children. He
said:
"There is 110 man in Etfropc or in all
the world who came out of the war who
has done more for humanity than a
Stanford man, Herbert Hoover."
In southern Russia, the speaker said,
he witnessed much distress among the
refugees of the army of General
Wrangel. He told of seeing great masses
of humanity piled together in boats.

The condition of the students and
professors in Vienna were said to be
serious. The annual salary of a professor
is sufficient to buy himself and family 1
an outfit of clothing, but there is no
money left with which to purchase
clothing. Students are forced to do any
kind of work they can find in order to
exist. Eddy urged his hearers to "take
the challenge of Herbert Hoover and
give $10 to keep a student alive. It not
only saves his life, but does much for
the whole student body."
"The world needs peace. National
racial and class strife are dominant in
the wrfrld. Every nation is demanding
self-determination, whether suited for it
or not. Class strife, the toiling masses
of the poor claiming their rights, is the
most serious kind of conflict.
"The significance of this situation is
that we arc now passing through the
greatest era of transition the world has
ever known. As great changes came
after the French revolution, so will
democracy finally emerge triumphant
when this decade is over."
"The desire of people for democracy,
though stifled for a thousand years, will
eventually assert itself. If this does not
come about through evolution people
will resort to revolution to bring it
about."
In England, Eddy said that changes
have recently been brought about by
evolution. Capital and labor lra.ve come
together to settle their differences by
submitting their disputes to a council
[composed of representatives of both fac
tions. This has proved an effective
means of preventing strikes, he said.
Dr. Jordan, who introduced the
speaker, was given a big ovation, the
occasion being his seventieth birthday.
Eddy spoke at a faculty luncheon fol
lowing the assembly.
