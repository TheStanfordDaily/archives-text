Wrist Watches
Are Cheaper This Week
By J. F. Haight
I We're having a special sale at this jewelry
store this week—the first in years. One of
the interesting things in the sale, is a collec
tion of 110 wrist watches, obtained from a
wholesaler who is willing to reduce his price
25 per cent to close them out. He wants to
confine his stock to the lines of one certain
manufacturer. So with this discount and a
I reduction in our own margin of profit we are
able to offer wrist watches, this week, at very
much less than the usual prices.
In the collection are small watches in the
various popular shapes, watches with gold
filled ases, 15 jewel guaranteed movements,
at $25, $27.50, and $30 —solid gold watches
at $32.50, $50, and $65. Then there are
platinum watches at $115 and $125, and
there are watches of platinum set with dia-
Imonds. These are priced at $225, $300 and
$500. Almost any kind of a watch desired is
here at really very much reduced prices.
