# GROCERS ASKED TO EXPLAIN APPARENT PRICE DIFFERENCE
## Chamber of Commerce Will Act As Mediator in Hearing Grievances of the Buyers 
### 
The Chamber of Commerce of Palo
Alto has agreed to act as a mediator in
hearing the grievance of the residents
of Palo Alto and Stanford against the
grocers of that city, who were asked to
explain the price table published Tues
day in The Daily Palo Alto, which
showed them to be charging prices for
merchandise in excess of surrounding
cities and towns.
The committee appointed for that
purpose at a recent meeting of the
campus house managers, and the editor
of The Daily Palo Alto, presented the
case today to Postmaster C. S. Kelly,
president of the Chamber of Commerce.
They explained that the movement was
aimed only at the grocers. After hear
ing a presentation of the facts and see
ing the comparative prices chart pub
lished by The Daily Palo Alto, he sent
out a letter to the grocers to appear be
fore the Chamber and explain why they
are selling goods at higher prices. Rep
resentatives of campus and Palo Alto
buyers will appear at the same time and
an effort will be made to reach some
sort of agreement.
In answer to the probable excuse of
the grocers that they are carrying un
paid bills at Stanford, it was suggested
that the house managers, who organized
Monday, agree to see that all bills arc
paid before a certain date.
Plans for cooperative buying are be
ing worked out in conjunction with the
campaign to bring grocery prices in Palo
Alto to a level of those in Redwood
City, San Jose, San Francisco and other
cities and towns throughout the country.
