# PALO ALTO "MOVIE" CENSORSHIP SERVED TO SPELL DEATH TO STUDENT ENJOYMENT
## 
### 
Stanford movie fans may be unable
to get the desired 'Hack" out of the
films hereafter due to the recent ac
tion of the City Council of Palo Alto
in appointing a committee for the
censorship of "objectionable" pic
tures.
The committee will be composed
of the members of the council com
mittee of public safety, representativ
es from the theatres and from the
different organizations that started
the movement.
This action is the result of com
plaints launched by the Parent-Teach
er's Association and the Methodist,
Presbyterian, Baptist and Episcopal
Church of Palo Alto.
