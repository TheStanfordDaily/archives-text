Louis Graveure, the noted Belgian
baritone, will be presented by frank
Healy in the second concert of the
Healy series, which is to be given this
evening in the Assembly Hall, at 8:30
o'clock. This will be Graveure's third
appearance at Stanford. His previ
ous visits will be remembered by those
who heard him, his last concert two
years ago, being particularly im
pressing. Since that time the artist
has made rapid strides, and is now
considered by critics to be in the
height of his powers. He is one of
the finest baritones now appearing on
the concert stage and comes directly
from a aeries of triumps in the East.
Graveure will have the assistance
of a young virtuoso, Eduard Gendron,
at the piano. Gendron is said to be
a remarkable pianist as well as ac
companist and will play two piano
solos during the evening.
The program Graveure has selected
is unusual in the variety and number
of the selections. Many of them are
not well-known, few operatic num
bers will be sung. The program, how
ever, is sonsidered one of Graveure's
most successful groups, and is one to
be enjoyeff both by the student of
music as well as the novice. The
program includes a wide variety of
songs. It opens with Graveure's
favorite group of Russian songs, and
includes a number of English, French
and Old English numbers.
The entire program this evening
will be as follows:
I. Russian Songs
In My Attic :...)
Death's Lullaby )
The Seminarian JMoussorgsky
The Doll's Cradle-Song )
Parasha's Revery )
