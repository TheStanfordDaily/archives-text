# POWELL'S MEN OVERCOME PACIFIC FIVE'S LEAD AND WIN IN LAST HALF, 30-18
## Righter Flings Five Field Goals; Richmond Contributes Two Sensational Shots 
### 
Ken Lilly s College of the Pacific
basketball five threw a scare into the
Stanford cage team last night that took
half of the game to recover from and
almost allowed them to romp away with
the Kjjpie, which was all in the way of
a surprise. Everyone figured tiiat the
Methodist college had a pretty fair
aggregation because they had defeated
the Olympic Club five, but no one sus
pected that they were quite so good as
they turned out to he.
The visitors hopped into the lead at
the start and at half time they were
leading 16 to 9. What Coach Powell
said to his warriors during the rest
period had good effect, for the Cardinal
varsity came back and played its oppo
nents off their feet. The final score was
30 to 18.
From the -first play it was evident
that something had gone wrong with the
varsity machinery. They didn't seem to
be able to get their bearings against
the Pacific men, who, on the other
hand, were playing a rapide-fire game
that dazzled even the spectators. Burch
field, forward, dropped two long field
goals through the hoop. Spurway, Stev
ens, and Spoon did the same thing once.
It was almost unbelievable. The varsity
played harder and harder, -but suc
ceeded only in piling up fouls which
were made to count by Burchfield, who
converted six of them. The teams left
the floor with the visitors leading.
It was a different story in the second
half. The guards evidently had their
orders to go after Burchfield, and play
after play was broken up, as every man
was going at full speed while the grind
was getting too heavy for the Methodist
aggregation. Slowly the Stanford score
mounted until it stood 15 to 16. Then
Dick Richmond took the pellet in mid
floor and made one of his fancy shots
for the score that put Stanford in the
lead. From then on it was all Stanford.
"Swede" Righter was the star of the
game with five clever shots that were
timely and did a great deal toward
wrecking the hopes of the College of
the Pacific team. Righter was closely
pressed for honors by Bert Mills, who
played his usual brilliant game, making
four field goals and converting six free
ones.
"Dick" Richmond broke into the sen
sational with two shots from the middle
of the floor that came at crucial times
and brought the spectators up yelling.
The College of the Pacific lias a fast,
well-balanced team, and they are bound
to be heard from in the California-
Nevada League. Coach "Bob" Harmon
was on hand from Santa Clara to get a
line on the visitors, as his team tangles
with them next Saturday night. We
wonder if he was pleased with what he
saw. The score:
