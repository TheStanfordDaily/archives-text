# INITIAL FRESHMAN CONTRIBUTION IS IN NEW PICTORIAL
## 
### 
The first of '24's contributions to the
Pictorial will appear in the coming issue
under the pseudonym "Sandy." The
subject of the article is the eternal
feminine again, and the title "The Hated
'Co-ed,' How Come?" The substance
seems to indicate a Robleite in hiding
behind the signature "Sandy," as the
defense is handled as by one intimate
with the injury. The roughs, and then
demoralizing influence upon the fresJj
men, if such a thing is possible, are
alleged to be the parties responsible for
this injustice to those amongst us who
arc fairer.
Dorothy Johnston, '21, is responsible
for a discussion of the question "Will
the Honor System Work at Stanford?"
Miss Johnston fears that unless a suit
able system of grading is inaugurated
that will eliminate this eternal cheating
and suspicion the present good reptita
lion of Stanford will suffer. She points
out that besides the personal satisfaction
of knowing that one is trusted there
will be the pride of knowing that Stan
ford turns out scholars of a .higher
moral calibcr, and that a more congenial
and trusted relation between the faculty
and student body will occur when each
group is confident of and fair towards
the other.
