# GLEE CLUB TO APPEAR IN SYMPHONY PROGRAM
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club plans to
give tangible evidence of their new
policy regarding the character of the
music they are singing in public, when
they appear on the program of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra at
the concert to be given in the As
sembly Hall, next Tuesday evening,
January 25.
The club will sing two songs sug
gestive of the sea. The first is Grieg's
famous "Land Sighting"; the second
an arrangement of Schubert's "By
the Sea"; and for the third one a stir
riug red-blooded viking song by Cole
ridge-Taylor. The latter is a sort of
modern anvil chorus and is one of the
most invigorating of all modern works
for male voices. The students will
sing under the direction of the Glee
Club conductor. Warren D. Allen.
For the remainder of the program,
Mr. Alfred Hertz is promisig selec
tions of rare beauty, including Schu
bert's beautiful "Unfinished Sympho
ny" and the well-known music from
Wagner's "Tristan Isolde," as well as
a number of other numbers.
The event will bo of particular in
terest to Stanford people, particularly
as the concert will be the last of the
Symphony Concert series to be given
this season. Tickets are still on sale
at the box office in the Administration
Building.
