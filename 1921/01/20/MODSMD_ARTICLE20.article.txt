# THE 						HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
Certain students interested in the honor system have been making
investigations here with a view of urging the installation of such a
system for the entire University. They have met with encouragement
trom President Wilbur and faculty members, and nothing seems to pre
vent the system from being inaugurated except the willingness of the
student body to take the initiative.
The success of the honor system is naturally dependent on the stu
dents themselves and in the interest they take in making the system a
success. Responsibility for reporting infractions of the honor code
must be taken by all alike, and in particular, members of the upper class
must consider themselves directly responsible. It takes courage for
any student to report another for cheating, but if the idea is impressed
upon the minds of every student that they are entirely on their honor
in all exammaions and in reporting a case of cheating they are simply
taking the best means of removing an individual who has the wrong
conception of what a Stanford man or woman should he and who is
not desired as a member of the Stanford student body, the honor sys
tem will be a success. Those who report the offenders will be doing
a real service to the University in eliminating such undesirable students.
It has been suggested that the departmental societies assume a ma
jor part of the burden of reporting infractions, and under their spon
sorship the honor system would be a success.
In the universities where the honor system has worked, the punish
ment for the offenders is generally expulsion, in addition to publishing
the names of the guilty ones. Violations of the honor code should not
be kept under cover by any means, and offenders in all cases should be
made known to the student body as one of the means of punishment and
as a warning to others.
I'efore the honor system cati be adopted, each department of the
University must approve it and agree to enforce it fully. The movement
cannot be installed too soon, and if each department takes prompt action
»n favoring its adoption the honor system will be inaugurated immedi
ately.
