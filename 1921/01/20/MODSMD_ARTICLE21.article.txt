# A
						REGRETTABLE INCIDENT
## 
### 
An extreme violation of the Stanford code took placc at the basket
ball game la9t night, when a group of irresponsibles expressed their dis
approval of the referee's decisions by booing and hooting. Such exhibi
tions are very rare on the Stanford campus and are discountenanced by
the entire student body. Stanford has always been known for its fair
treatment of visiting teams and of the officials in charge of the games,
and the Incident last night is not representative of the Stanford student
body. There are places for those students who participated in the oc
currence, but the Stanford campus is not one of them. On behalf of
the student body The Daily Palo Alto apologizes to the referee and the
visiting team for the breach of courtesy.
