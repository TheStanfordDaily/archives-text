# ED WIN A. COTTRELL SERVES PUBLIC IN DUAL CAPACITY
## 
### 
Woodrow Wilson leaving the aca
demic halls of Princeton to assume the
presidency in 1913 and William Howard
Taft vacating that office and accepting
a professorial chair at Yale made an
interchange of position which at the
time struck the sense of humor of the
American people. Though a coinci
dence, the donning of the professor's
cap and gown by Taft while Wilson
was entering the White House formed
a pointed illustration of the present-day
interrelation between university and
government. Formerly the "man on the
street" regarded the title of "Professor
of Political Science" as a confession of
impracticability; today, the professor is
sought by politicians, self-styled as
practical, to aid them in solving the com
plex problems of legislation and admin
istration.
Social investigator, government ex
pert, and educator, Edwin A. Cottrell
well represents that school of political
economists who combine theoretical re
search with applied administration. A
brief resume indicates the variety of his
active political work. Boston, in 1915,
desiring to overhaul its antiquated
financial system, appointed a budget
commission, which Professor Cottrell
served as secretary. The efficient sys
tem now in operation was installed upon
the recommendation of the commission.
The city manager plan of municipal
government was just coming into vogue
in 1916, when Cottrell became efficiency
engineer for Newton, Massachusetts.
As engineer, a position corresponding to
city manager, he organized the city's
departmental machinery. The following
year lie became assistant secretary of
the Boston Chamber of Commerce. His
duties required him to investigate the
current bills before the Boston Council
and the Massachusetts Legislature and
advise the commercial body as to the
probable effects of the measures upon
the business life of the state.
Director of the Ohio State Bureau of
Government Research from 1917 to

1919, Professor Cottrell's position was
one of varied responsibility. Not only
in acting as a clearing-house of political
information, the bureau, in addition,
served the state by aiding in the re
organization of municipal and county
governments. In training and equipping
governmental experts for the appointive
positions, the bureau sought to meet an
administrative need made acute by the
constant shift of American elective
officials.
The college life of Professor Cottrell
is reassuring to those who attempt to
balance their studies with participation
in student activities, for he graduated
from Swarthmore College in 1907 with
a high scholastic record and a leader of
the student body. A member of three
athletic teams, football, track, and base
ball, he did not confine his interest to
athletics). He represented Swarthmore
both in debating and in journalism,
serving on the varsity forensic squad
and as editor of the college paper.
A wide experience as a professor of
political science in the universities of
the East preceded his appointment to a
professorial chair at Stanford in 1919.
From 1907 to 1911 he served as an in
structor in the Pennsylvania State Col
lege. Harvard, Wellesley, Brown, and
Ohio State University at different times
claimed him for the next eight years.
During the last two years of the period
he was acting head of the department
of political science of the Ohio Univer
sity. This year, during the absence of
Professor Victor West, he holds a sim
ilar position at Stanford.
Though a resident of California for
but little over a year, lie has taken an
active interest in the politics of the
community and the state. As a member
of the city planning and civil service
committees of the Commonwealth Club
of San Francisco, director of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce, member of
the Palo Alto Library Board, his serv
ices are welcomed by these organiza
tions in their social work. Professor
Cottrell is a member of Phi Delta Theta.

probable effects of the measures upon
the business life of the state.
Director of the Ohio State Bureau of
Government Research from 1917 to

1919, Professor Cottrell's position was
one of varied responsibility. Not only
in acting as a clearing-house of political
information, the bureau, in addition,
served the state by aiding in the re
organization of municipal and county
governments. In training and equipping
governmental experts for the appointive
positions, the bureau sought to meet an
administrative need made acute by the
constant shift of American elective
officials.
The college life of Professor Cottrell
is reassuring to those who attempt to
balance their studies with participation
in student activities, for he graduated
from Swarthmore College in 1907 with
a high scholastic record and a leader of
the student body. A member of three
athletic teams, football, track, and base
ball, he did not confine his interest to
athletics). He represented Swarthmore
both in debating and in journalism,
serving on the varsity forensic squad
and as editor of the college paper.
A wide experience as a professor of
political science in the universities of
the East preceded his appointment to a
professorial chair at Stanford in 1919.
From 1907 to 1911 he served as an in
structor in the Pennsylvania State Col
lege. Harvard, Wellesley, Brown, and
Ohio State University at different times
claimed him for the next eight years.
During the last two years of the period
he was acting head of the department
of political science of the Ohio Univer
sity. This year, during the absence of
Professor Victor West, he holds a sim
ilar position at Stanford.
Though a resident of California for
but little over a year, lie has taken an
active interest in the politics of the
community and the state. As a member
of the city planning and civil service
committees of the Commonwealth Club
of San Francisco, director of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce, member of
the Palo Alto Library Board, his serv
ices are welcomed by these organiza
tions in their social work. Professor
Cottrell is a member of Phi Delta Theta.
Woodrow Wilson leaving the aca
demic halls of Princeton to assume the
presidency in 1913 and William Howard
Taft vacating that office and accepting
a professorial chair at Yale made an
interchange of position which at the
time struck the sense of humor of the
American people. Though a coinci
dence, the donning of the professor's
cap and gown by Taft while Wilson
was entering the White House formed
a pointed illustration of the present-day
interrelation between university and
government. Formerly the "man on the
street" regarded the title of "Professor
of Political Science" as a confession of
impracticability; today, the professor is
sought by politicians, self-styled as
practical, to aid them in solving the com
plex problems of legislation and admin
istration.
Social investigator, government ex
pert, and educator, Edwin A. Cottrell
well represents that school of political
economists who combine theoretical re
search with applied administration. A
brief resume indicates the variety of his
active political work. Boston, in 1915,
desiring to overhaul its antiquated
financial system, appointed a budget
commission, which Professor Cottrell
served as secretary. The efficient sys
tem now in operation was installed upon
the recommendation of the commission.
The city manager plan of municipal
government was just coming into vogue
in 1916, when Cottrell became efficiency
engineer for Newton, Massachusetts.
As engineer, a position corresponding to
city manager, he organized the city's
departmental machinery. The following
year lie became assistant secretary of
the Boston Chamber of Commerce. His
duties required him to investigate the
current bills before the Boston Council
and the Massachusetts Legislature and
advise the commercial body as to the
probable effects of the measures upon
the business life of the state.
