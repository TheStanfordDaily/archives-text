Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: Last night at the freshman
basketball game tbe referee was hooted
for some decisions made in the first of
the contest. Here we pride ourselves
on that spirit that stands above making
a show of childish displeasure at ad
verse decision in athletic contests. The
first hoots last night were from a scat
tered few, but with the repetition of
close decesions the war broke from all
sides until Coach Seay rose and had to
ask the onlookers to be quiet unless
they could voice something besides
howls of disapproval. The referee 'has
been here lie fore and he is known to be
absolutely fair. He simply called the
players on the infringement of some of
the rules about which the spectators
neither knew or cared nothing. Such
mooing and hooting is an insult to the
veracity of the refree and the rest of
the spectatirs, who are judged by the
actions of a loud few.
