# STADIUM PLANS SENT FOR ALUMNI APPROVAL
## 
### 
Plans for the financing of the pro
posed football stadium at Stanford have
been sent by the Board of Athletic Con
trol to the alumni for their approval,
support, or suggestions. If the board
is to go ahead with the project actual
construction work must begin this
spring.
In its letter the hoard explains that
it has reached two definite conclusions.
First—That it is not possible to con
struct the stadium on a strictly invest
ment basis; that is, by borrowing
money. The interest charge on the esti
mated cost would equal, if not exceed"
the increased earning capacity of the
contemplated structure. This, therefore,
would not permit any reduction of a
principle nor expansion in the athletic
program of the University.
Second—lt is not, in the opinion of
the board, practicable to raise the money
by an advance sale of tickets, as this
would to a considerable extent mortgage
the future and tie up for a length of
time the income which will be needed
otherwise. The board considers that it
cannot continue its athletic program as
planned if any considerable portion of
its future normal income is diverted.
To quote from the letter, "After dis
cussing the matter with many alumni
and other friends of the University, the

Board of Athletic Control feels that any
plan Tor raising the money required must
be based on an increased price for the
best tickets, at least during the period
that the stadium is being paid for. The
recommendation of the board is, there
fore, this: ticket privileges for fifteen
years will be given in return for sub
scriptions to the stadium. A subscrip
tion of $100 will assure the subscriber
the right to buy two choice reserved
seats for a period of fifteen years at a
price of $4 a seat. A subscription of
$200 will assure the subscriber the right
to buy four choice reserved seats for a
period of fifteen years at a price of $4
a seat. And so on up to a point where
an option can he had on ten by a
subscription of $500. Subscriptions of
more than $500 will be most welcome as
gifts to help out the valuable work, but
the board does not consider it fair to
the alumni in general to allot larger
blocks of seats. To those not subscrib
ing and securing the guaranteed rights
of purchase, it is proposed that the best
seats will be sold for $5, and that appli
cations will have to be made with no
more assurance than has been given in
the past that the seats will be available."
The letter also explained the plans for
the construction of the new stadium, the
cost of which is now estimated to be
$500,000
