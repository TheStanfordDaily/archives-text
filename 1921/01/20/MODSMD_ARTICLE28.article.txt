# W. D. Sweet Lectures To Citizenship Classes
## 
### 
"I have been willing to do what
everyone else agreed ought to be done,
when no one else was willing to do it."
This quotation from one of the late
Theodore Roosevelt's characteristic
talks at a Harvard University reunion
constituted the theme of an address
given yesterday morning to the three
citizenship classes in the Assembly Hall
by W. D. Sweet, of Denver, Colorado.
Mr. Sweet's plea was for college edu
cations and more of them. He discussed
the inadequacy of the institutions of
higher learning today to cope with the
large number of candidates for admis
sion. He also took up some of the
student movements participated in by
the youth of other nationsâ€”particu
larly the student strike in China.
He continued: "Leaders of this gen
eration are in the high schools and col
leges of the country; the educated mind
will constitute the leadership of the
future."
The speaker gave the three require
ments of successful leadership as fol
lows :
"Leaders must respect human beings."
"Leaders must possess an open mind."
"Leaders must be courageous and un
afraid."
