# BUSINESS MAN'S MOTIVE IS TOPIC OF MR. SWEET
## 
### 
That the most successful business
man iB the man whose life is the most
useful in the community, rather than
the oue who has acquired the most
wealth, was the opinion expressed by
Mr. H. B. Sweet, in his address upon
"The Business Man and His Over
flow," at the Little Theater last night.
"We must serve rather than save;
give rather than gain; then we will
lead the life of the overflow." He
stated that there are many opportuni
ties for service—things which need
just the business ability and acumen
which the ordinary business man can
put In.
Mr. Sweet believes that thorough
business organization is very essential
if a man ever intends to build up his
business to any size. "More busi
nesses go on the rocks from dry rot
and disorganization than from
other season that I know of. New
men with new ideas, new thought, and
new purposes must be constantly fed
in from the bottom."
A man's business should be so
thoroughly organized that it can go on
without him if he should be gone.
Then if anything required/ (his ab
sence, he would be able to get away
almost upon a moment's notice.
Mr. Sweet concluded his speech by
quoting from Chesterton: "We cannot
in the end rejoice in anything less
than the whole scheme of things."
