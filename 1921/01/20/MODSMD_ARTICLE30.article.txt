# RAM'S HEAD TO BEGIN REHEARSALS AT ONCE
## 
### 
Rehearsals for the Ram's Head show
will start immediately, as there will not
he any too much time before February
11, when the show is to he put on, to
get the cast whipped into shape and the
choruses doing the light fantastic in a
graceful and commendable fashion.
Dame Rumor has it that the leading
lady's voice is all that is to be expected
as to "sweet and limpid" qualities, and
that she and other "ladies" of the cast
are all that is graceful and beautiful.
Coach Lester Seib is enthused over
the material he has to work with this
year and is anxious to start rehearsals.
They will probably be held in the
Women's Clubhouse until the work on
the Masquers' play is finished Friday and
they can use the Assembly Hall.
