# FINAL TOUCHES POT ON COMEDY IN REHEARSALS
## Two Dress Practices are Held for Masquers' Comedy; Coach Predicts Big Success 
### 
Two dress rehearsals have been held
for the Masquers' comedy, "Trelawney
of the Wells," due to the heaviness of
the production, mass of scenery, prop
erties, lighting effects and novelty scene
in the last act; All the rough edges have
been rubbed off, according to Coach
Gordon Davis, and the show will pro
ceed without a hitch ne*t Friday even
ing.
The word "mid-Victorian" has a ten
dency to give the idea that the play is
deeper, more sober and of a more
classical type of dramatics than it is.
Pinero's comedy, on the other hand,
might be called a burlesque of the Vic
torian age. It is filled to the brim with
comedy and "spicy" lines and is the kind
of a play that a campus audience will
delight in seeing.
In the part of Mr. Ablett, played by
Hudson Proctor, wit and clever acting
reigns supreme. Ablett is nothing more
than the neighborhood grocer, and he is
mustered into serving the banquet given
in honor of Rose Trelawney when she
leaves the Wells Theater with Arthur
Gower to go to his home in order to
learn how to "properly conduct herself"
in the eyes of Trafalga Gower and her
brother, Sir William. Ablett's inexperi
ence in serving the dinner, his blunders
and his awkwardness carry with them
some of the most clever acting of the
scene. Proctor has worked out his part
to perfection.
Along with the inexperienced "hasher"
plays Fern Weaver in the role of Mrs.
Mossop, the landlady, and, like all land
ladies, she is a howling success.
The most outstanding part of the pro
duction is the fourth act. Most of the
fun and clever work of the author in
this scene is centered in O'Dwyer, an
irrepressible Irishman, who conducts a
rehearsal in the Royal Olympic Theater.
Eugene Curtis, in this part, makes a
typical stage director. His Irish brogue
and ability to change his character from
the passions of anger to calm emotions
of affection, give to the audience abund
ance of laughter.
The Masquers' Society, when it chose
"Trelawney of the Wells" for its pro
duction, picked one of the most sensa
tional and popular English comedies of
modern times. Its author, Pinero, cut
all binding twines and put in the manu
script of his play every bid for humor
and comical action possible.
Tickets for the production can still
be obtained 011 the campus. There are
also good scats at Crandall's in Palo
Alto.

than the neighborhood grocer, and he is
mustered into serving the banquet given
in honor of Rose Trelawney when she
leaves the Wells Theater with Arthur
Gower to go to his home in order to
learn how to "properly conduct herself"
in the eyes of Trafalga Gower and her
brother, Sir William. Ablett's inexperi
ence in serving the dinner, his blunders
and his awkwardness carry with them
some of the most clever acting of the
scene. Proctor has worked out his part
to perfection.
Along with the inexperienced "hasher"
plays Fern Weaver in the role of Mrs.
Mossop, the landlady, and, like all land
ladies, she is a howling success.
The most outstanding part of the pro
duction is the fourth act. Most of the
fun and clever work of the author in
this scene is centered in O'Dwyer, an
irrepressible Irishman, who conducts a
rehearsal in the Royal Olympic Theater.
Eugene Curtis, in this part, makes a
typical stage director. His Irish brogue
and ability to change his character from
the passions of anger to calm emotions
of affection, give to the audience abund
ance of laughter.
The Masquers' Society, when it chose
"Trelawney of the Wells" for its pro
duction, picked one of the most sensa
tional and popular English comedies of
modern times. Its author, Pinero, cut
all binding twines and put in the manu
script of his play every bid for humor
and comical action possible.
Tickets for the production can still
be obtained 011 the campus. There are
also good scats at Crandall's in Palo
Alto.
