# THETA CHIS LEAD INTERMURAL FIVES
## Quintets in League One Will Battle for Supremacy This Afternoon in Encina Gym 
### 
Dispute arising over the game be
tween the Japanese Club quintet and
the Theta Chi five yesterday after
noon, lead to the tentative agreement
to re-play the game on the large court.
When time was up the Japanese were
one point in the lead, but the referee
was not informed that the limit was
reached until fifteen seconds had
passed, in which time the Theta Chis
shot another basket.
The referee ruled the basket legitim
ate. This made the score 13 to 12
in favor of the Theta Chi team. The
Japanese protested, and then tbe fra
ternity captain offered to play the
game over. Koba, the Japanese cap
tain and star forward, said he was
willing if his team-mates had no ob
jection. The future game will draw
a large crowd, according to intramural
fans, for the teams are evenly match
ed and both lives are determined play
ers. The date for the game has not
been selected.
The Theta Chi basket shooters lead
yesterday's contest by a margin of
several points up to the last few
minutes. The Japanese Club spurted
in the final minutes, and threw four
baskets in rapid succession, breaking
into the lead by one point.
The fraternity team had the ad
vantage in size and strength, and were
aided by the cramped quarters. Their
advantage was offset by the greater
speed and team-work of the smaller
men. Kitow and Koba played to
gether well, and their clever work
won several bursts of applause from
the spectators.
Fans were agreed that these two
teams are among the top notch play
ers of the intramural leagues, and
some predicted that one or the other
would romp away with the campus
championship.
Sigma Nu annexed a 2 to 0 decision
over the Encina (west second) quin
tet by default. Spurting in the final
period, the Phi Gamma Delta basket
ers ran away frim Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon, leaving them on the short end
of a 20 to G score. The first half was
a hard fight, ending 4 to 4. It was
marked by close guarding on both
sides.
The standings of the teams in
League Two are:
Team W. L. Pet.
Theta Chi 2 0 1000

advantage was offset by the greater
speed and team-work of the smaller
men. Kitow and Koba played to
gether well, and their clever work
won several bursts of applause from
the spectators.
Fans were agreed that these two
teams are among the top notch play
ers of the intramural leagues, and
some predicted that one or the other
would romp away with the campus
championship.

over the Encina (west second) quin
tet by default. Spurting in the final
period, the Phi Gamma Delta basket

a hard fight, ending 4 to 4. It was

Dispute arising over the game be
tween the Japanese Club quintet and
the Theta Chi five yesterday after
noon, lead to the tentative agreement
to re-play the game on the large court.
When time was up the Japanese were
one point in the lead, but the referee
was not informed that the limit was
reached until fifteen seconds had
passed, in which time the Theta Chis
shot another basket.
The referee ruled the basket legitim
ate. This made the score 13 to 12
in favor of the Theta Chi team. The
Japanese protested, and then tbe fra
ternity captain offered to play the
game over. Koba, the Japanese cap
tain and star forward, said he was
willing if his team-mates had no ob
jection. The future game will draw
a large crowd, according to intramural
fans, for the teams are evenly match
ed and both lives are determined play
ers. The date for the game has not
been selected.
The Theta Chi basket shooters lead
yesterday's contest by a margin of
several points up to the last few
minutes. The Japanese Club spurted
in the final minutes, and threw four
baskets in rapid succession, breaking
into the lead by one point.
The fraternity team had the ad
vantage in size and strength, and were
aided by the cramped quarters. Their
advantage was offset by the greater
speed and team-work of the smaller
men. Kitow and Koba played to
