# FRESHMAN QUINTET DOWNS OAKLAND TECH
## 
### 
Duffy Seay's freshman quintet hung
up another bar on their victory string
last night when they put the Oakland
Technical High five to sleep, 33 to 14.
Playing fast, though jerkily, through the
entire game, and handicapped by close
foul calling, the Babes steadied in the
second half and left the transbay boys
in the dust. The Oaklanders got but
one goal in the two periods of play.
flic start of the game was ragged,
and the fast team from Oakland took
the freshmen off their feet for the first
few minutes. Then, as the Babes
steadied, the scores began to pile up. In
the first period the high school men took
the lead and kept it for a space of ten
minutes. McHose was put out of the
game and Bragg substituted, and Atwill
went in for Cooper. Atwill shot a
couple of pretty ones from the center
of the floor. Jensen annexed four counts
and the half ended. The score stood
13 to 10 in favor of the Stanford fresh
men.
WTTcn the boys came hack on the
floor for the second half things changed.
The Oaklanders got careless, and good
free shooting on the part of Granger
and Bragg helped the score up on the
Stanford side. Jensen slipped' in two
more field goals in this half and then
went out on four personal fouls. Mati
noccir substituted. Lowenstein went in
for Bragg and managed to drop in a
couple of free throws.
On the Oakland team no one starred.
They had a highly efficient organization
all around and gave the Babes a hard
fight all the time. Dichl and Peters,
forwards, shared the scoring honors
with six and seven points, respectively.
Truman, the center, made the other
tally.
