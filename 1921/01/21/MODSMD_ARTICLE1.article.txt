# LOUIS GRAVEURE GIVES WIDE AND VARIED PROGRAM
## Artist Possesses Voice of Unusual Beauty; Ease of Interpretation Is Pleasing 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
To hear Louiß Graveure Is to hear
not only a man possessing a voice of
rare beauty and resonance, but to hear
an artist In every sense of the word
who has attained a perfect balance
of voice, tone, technique and complete
understanding, and the art of convey
ing thiß impression to his audience
which belongs only to the truly great.
In his program in the Assembly Hall
last evening the noted baritone sang
each and every number with an ex
quisite finish that delighted and
satisfied. His voice is not of the ro
bust type but is characterized chiefly
by its refined and velvety quality and
range. Added to this is a distinctive
mastery of style and perfect diction,
and the power to bring out the
dramatic intensity, the beauty and

Revery and Dance" number, sung in
a spirited manner which brought out
all its imagery and rhythm.
The Old English songs, among them
"Westron Wynde," and "What If a
Day" were sung with a grace and
finish and an unaffected ease which
was delightful. In his selection of
French songs, Graveure gave a spon
taneous and charming interpretation
which emphasized the French charac
ter of these numbers. He substituted
the "Toreador" song in place of "Va
lentine's /Song" from "Faust," and
this number was particularly interest
ing in that it was sung in a manner
different from the interpretation of
most artists and in a way entirely
characteristic of Graveure's repressed
but colorful style.
The group which followed was made
up of a number of Hungarian songs,
arranged in English. Those among
them which were particularly distict
ive in appeal being "Morning in the
Village," and "O'er the Forest. The
final songs, among them "Cancion
Andalusia" and Wagner's "Star of
