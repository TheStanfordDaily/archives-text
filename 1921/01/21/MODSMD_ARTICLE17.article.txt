# SEAY'S QUINTET WILL PLAY COMMERCE HIGH
## Game Tomorrow Night Only Athletic Event; Freshmen Expect Fast, Hard Tussle 
### 
Tomorrow night, at 7 p.m., the
freshman basket squad meets Com
merce High of San Francisco, on the
local floor. The city team is fast, and
according to dope from the bay region
puts out as good a scrap as the quin
tet that was down last Wednesday
evening from Oakland Technical. The
babes are in good shape after a prac
tice last night against the varsity.
The same line-up as has been used
in past games will probably start the
game tomorrow night. All the men
were used last night in the scrimmage
and all worked in good shape. Coach
Seay is paying a good deal of atten
tion now to the development of team
attack and passing, relying on the
working of the ball down to close
under the basket before making shots
for the goal.
Smith and Jaiisen are alternating at
standing guard and center to ease up
a little on Jansen who is slightly be
hind the others in regard to condi
tion. His fast playing takes all his
wind, and the brief respite of the
back position once in a while gives
time to get a breath in the midst of
the game. McHose is improving
every day in his basket work, especi
ally on the long shots. Coach Seay
has been after Granger to make him
shoot for the basket instead of pass
ing to his partner forward and has
him working out well now on the
shooting end.
