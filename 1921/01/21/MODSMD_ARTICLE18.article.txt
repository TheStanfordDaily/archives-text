# CURRENT PICTORIAL COVERS WIDE FIELD OF LOCAL INTEREST
## 
### 
The Stanford Pictorial, which will
go on sale the early part of next
week will feature in its illustrated
section, pictures of the recent Wo
men's Interclass Hockey Series, with
Mills College. These are the first pic
tures of women's athletics that have
ever been printed in a Campus maga
zine, and they will be found of great
interest to the followers of the sport.
Harry Borba, '22, has written the
article "The 1921 Basketball Season."
The story forecasts the basketball
season's probabilities of victory for
the varsity, basing its logic on the
basis of the pro-season results. It is
the kind of story that Borba is best
at. a breezy sport article.
An article on "The Era of Ex
pansion" is another contribution from
S. N. Pierce, '22. The progress that
has been made in respect to the con
struction of the Stadium, the new
Union building and the War Memori
al, is catalogued.
