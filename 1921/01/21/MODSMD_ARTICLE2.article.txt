# Euphronia Submits Question For Debate
## 
### 
Euphronia Debating Socicty lias sub
mitted the following question to Ncs
toria for the intersociety debate which
will be held this 'quarter: "Resolved,
that the first two years should be
dropped from the curriculum of Stan
ford University." No word has been
received from the Nestoria committee
as to the acceptance of the question.
At the regular weekly meeting last
night members of Euphronia threshed
out the question: "Resolved, that a
federal court be established to settle
industrial disputes with the power to
enforce its decisions." The discussion
was started by Sydney Grossman, '23,
who took the affirmative, and his argu
ments were countered by George De
vor, '21. Then general discussion was
opened and the technical points clarified.
Members of Euphronia wish to urge
all new men of the University to attend
the meetings of the socicty. All mem
bers will meet on the Library steps for
the Quad picture tomorrow at 12:05.
