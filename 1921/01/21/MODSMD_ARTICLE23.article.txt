# THE 						SOUTHERN AWAKENING
## 
### 
Alumni in Southern California arose in their wrath the other day
and passed some angry resolutions condemning the tuition fees and the
entrance requirements. They also deplored the lack of "red-blooded"
men in the University, and expressed fear that their Alma Mater was
on the downward path, instead of on the road to progress. While The
Daily Palo Alto does not agree with all of the views exrpessed by the
Los Angeles association, it is gratifying to see the Stanford men and
women in the South wake up and take interest in the University.
They undoubtedly will be glad to know that a joint committee of
students and alumni is working with the Committee on Entrance in an
effort to obtain a revision of the entrance requirements. It is the idea
of the student-alumni committee to secure the best men in the State for
Stanford, and with this end in view they hope to secure entrance on the
basis of active participation in high-school activities, without letting down
the scholarshp bar to any great extent. There is no doubt that Stanford
can always use good athletes, debaters, journalists, and men full of "pep,"
as well as prospective Phi Beta Kappas, but we hardly appreciate the hint
cast out by the Los Angeles Alumni Association that "red-blooded" men
are lacking in the University.
The southern alumni also decided to work for the neJct appointment
to 'the Board of Trustees. This is no more than fair, as all of the present
Trustees are residents of the northern part of the State, and the South
would seem to be the logical place for the next Trustee to come from.
Many of the conditions complained of by the Los Angeles men can
be remedied by more active participation in Stanford affairs by the alumni
in general, and the more complaints they have the better, if they are will
in glo help remedy them. The southerners have already started on this
path by offering a number of tuition scholarships for southern high
school men who will qualify as all-around men.
