# U. S. C. Has Bright Outlook For Track In Coming Season; Many Stars Back
## Paddock, Schiller, Evans, Wilson and Boyle Are Out; and Boyle Are Out; Schiller to Pilot the Team 
### 
The University of Southern Cali
fornia will have a victorious varsity
track team if present indications are
any basis for the formation of an
opinion so early in the track practice.
Paddock, Schiller, Evans, Wilson,
and Boyle, all of whom competed in
the eastern Olympic tryouts last sum
mer and three of whom represented
the United States at Belgium, are
among those who will be out under
the guidance of Coach Dean Crom
well next week. These men will doubt
less score heavily in the spri»tß, the
half-mile, and the weights. The squad
is to be under the leadership of
George Schiller, the famous half-miler,
this season.
According to the present schedule
the Cardinal and Gold squads will
have return meets with California, and
Stanford in addition to their meet
with the University of Missouri. All
the contests take place on the Bovard
Field in Los Angeles. Southern
meets will doubtless be arranged, and
the sending of a team to the Penn
State Relay Carnival has already
planned for.
Southern California's lack of ma
terial in the high jump, the hurdles,
and long distance runs will be par
tially supplied by the members of
last year's frosh team, and by trans
fers who were unable to compete a
year ago. Among these latter is Lloyd
Rogers formerly of Stanford, who is
expected to make a very strong show
ing this season in the hurdles and
In the broad jump. Lester Leading
ham, star pole vaulter of last year's
squad, will be the only casualty upon
the list when the season opens, he
being injured in an accident last sum
mer which will keep him from partici
pating in athletics this year. Aside
from Leadingham, practically every
member of last year's aggregation,
which was the strongest in the his
tory of the University, will be back
on the cinder path and for this reason
a very strong varsity team may be
expected.
