# LEGION POST WILL PLAY SOCCERITES TOMORROW
## Prominent Stanford Athletes On Legion Squad; Varsity Wins San Francisco Praise 
### 
Soccer is on the schedule tomorrow
with the varsity lined up against the
Palo Alto post of the American
Legion. The game will not be an
easy one for Stanford to any means,
especially as some noted Cardinal
athletes are playing on the American
Legion team. The contest will start
at 3:00 o'clock on the local turf.
Coach Harry Maloney will be on the
opposition side in this fracas. As
commander of the local post, he has
organized the Legion squad and will
himself play center forward. Among
other well-known Stanfordites who
will play are "Dink" Templeion,
Charley Doe, Peavy, and Walthers.
Thus the American Legion team is
almost an all-star collection, and can
be expected to make the varsity work
to win.
There has been no practice this
week, due mainly to adverse weather
conditions. However, the team has
had a good rest since the game with
the Olympic team last Saturday. It
was undoubtedly one of the best ex
hibits of playing up in an emergency
that a Stanford team has ever ex
hibited. San Franciscans praised the
Cardinal squad for its fine work. Wm.
Campbell, Secretary of the California
Soccer Association, and Don Morri
son, Chairman of the Executive Com
mittee of the Association, both ex
pressed the opinion that Stanford, as
she played on Saturday, was strong
enough to stop any of the Sunday
league teams, which are the strongest
of all the organization teams.
The line-up for tomorrow's game
will be the same as that which faced
the Olympics with one exception.
Anderson, who is also a basketball
player, will not be in the game. Men
doza will play full back in his ab
sence, and Elmore, who played on the
freshman team, will take Mendoza's
place at outside right.
