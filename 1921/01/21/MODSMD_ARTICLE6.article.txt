# Opposition Increased To Car Fare Raise
## 
### 
The opposition to the Peninsular
Realway Company's petition for an
increase in fares received an added
impetus yesterday with the announce
ment that the city of Palo Alto had
taken steps to prevent the increase
being granted. The city has dele
gated the mayor, city engineer, and
the city attorney to appear at the
State Railroad Commission's hearing
at San Jose and contest the petition.
The hearing, which was to have
taken place last Wednesday and to
which a representative of the Student
Body was sent, was postponed to Feb
ruary 14, when it will be held before
a member of the State Railroad Com
mission.
