# MASQUERS' PLAY TONIGHT IS HUMOROUS PICTURE OF VICTORIAN THEATRE LIFE
## Pinero Production One of Spicy Comedy; Seat Sale at Box Office; Curtain at 8:15

Due to the mass of scenery and the

rise promptly tonight at 8:15 o'clock for
the Masquers' comedy, "Trelawney of

to "pull" his "bum" comedy when not
acting upon the stage.
Archie Steele plays Ferdinand Gadd.
He does a splendid piece of character
work in the part of a romantic man
with an abundance of conceit, is tem
peramental and laughable. In the end
he marries Avonia Bunn, Melba Berry,
and their wedding party goes to the
