# MASQUERS' PLAY TONIGHT IS HUMOROUS PICTURE OF VICTORIAN THEATRE LIFE
## Pinero Production One of Spicy Comedy; Seat Sale at Box Office; Curtain at 8:15 
### 
Due to the mass of scenery and the
heaviness of the play, the curtain will
rise promptly tonight at 8:15 o'clock for
the Masquers' comedy, "Trelawney of
the Wells." Coach Gordon Davis has
adopted the policy of starting all future
productions at that time. ,'Wedding
Bells," the sopohomore comedy, staged
last quarter, was started on time, and
as a result a certain portion of the
audience was not seated.
The old-time setting of "Trelawney
of the Wells," written in modern
comedy, is a clever humorous idea com
posed by the play's author, Sir Arthur
Wing Pinero. The word mid-Victorian
has the tendency to give the impres
sion that the comedy is "old-fashioned"

and "dry." On the contrary, it is rich
in modern and "spicy" humor.
One of the most pleasing characters
of the skit is Augustus Colpoys, played
by Roy Riffle. He is an Eccentric
comedian of the Wells Theater troupe.
Much to the disgust of the members of
the troupe, he is continually called upon
to "pull" his "bum" comedy when not
acting upon the stage.
Archie Steele plays Ferdinand Gadd.
He does a splendid piece of character
work in the part of a romantic man
with an abundance of conceit, is tem
peramental and laughable. In the end
he marries Avonia Bunn, Melba Berry,
and their wedding party goes to the
home of Vice-Chancellor Sir William
Gower to visit Rose Trelawney, former
actress of the Wells.
The wedding party is the downfall of
Rose. She has been at the home of the
vice-chancellor to learn how "to conduct
herself properly." Wine, women, and
song flows too freely, and then enters
Sir William and his sister, Trafalga.
The role of Sir William is played by
Alvan Wendt. He came into the cast
late, but has successfully made it one of
the most convincing parts of the drama.
In this scene, where the wedding party
visits his home, he and his sister, Tra
falga Gower, an old maid, play a bit
of the best comedy of the production.
Virginia Woodruff takes the part of
Trafalga. She is utterly horrified when
her eyes see the hilarious actions of the
midnight revelers. She enters the stage
in nightclothes, but quickly makes her
self "conspicuously absent" by hiding
behind a screen.
Servant parts of the play are taken
by F. E.Wilson as Charles, butler to Sir
William, and Catherine Taff as Sara,
a maid at the Wells. These two minor
parts call for clever acting, and both
of the characters are well executed.
After the play a dance will be given
by the Masquers' Society at the Women's
Clubhouse. Good seats for the produc
tion can still be obtained at Crandall s
in Palo Alto and will be sold at tin/ box
office tonight.

office tonight.
Due to the mass of scenery and the
heaviness of the play, the curtain will
rise promptly tonight at 8:15 o'clock for
the Masquers' comedy, "Trelawney of
the Wells." Coach Gordon Davis has
adopted the policy of starting all future
productions at that time. ,'Wedding
Bells," the sopohomore comedy, staged
last quarter, was started on time, and
as a result a certain portion of the
audience was not seated.
The old-time setting of "Trelawney
of the Wells," written in modern
comedy, is a clever humorous idea com
posed by the play's author, Sir Arthur
Wing Pinero. The word mid-Victorian
has the tendency to give the impres
sion that the comedy is "old-fashioned"

and "dry." On the contrary, it is rich
in modern and "spicy" humor.
One of the most pleasing characters
of the skit is Augustus Colpoys, played
by Roy Riffle. He is an Eccentric
comedian of the Wells Theater troupe.
Much to the disgust of the members of
the troupe, he is continually called upon
to "pull" his "bum" comedy when not
acting upon the stage.
Archie Steele plays Ferdinand Gadd.
He does a splendid piece of character
work in the part of a romantic man
with an abundance of conceit, is tem
peramental and laughable. In the end
he marries Avonia Bunn, Melba Berry,
and their wedding party goes to the
home of Vice-Chancellor Sir William
Gower to visit Rose Trelawney, former
actress of the Wells.
The wedding party is the downfall of
Rose. She has been at the home of the
vice-chancellor to learn how "to conduct
herself properly." Wine, women, and
song flows too freely, and then enters
Sir William and his sister, Trafalga.
The role of Sir William is played by
Alvan Wendt. He came into the cast
late, but has successfully made it one of
the most convincing parts of the drama.
In this scene, where the wedding party
visits his home, he and his sister, Tra
falga Gower, an old maid, play a bit
of the best comedy of the production.
Virginia Woodruff takes the part of
Trafalga. She is utterly horrified when
her eyes see the hilarious actions of the
midnight revelers. She enters the stage
in nightclothes, but quickly makes her
self "conspicuously absent" by hiding
behind a screen.
Servant parts of the play are taken
by F. E.Wilson as Charles, butler to Sir
William, and Catherine Taff as Sara,
a maid at the Wells. These two minor
parts call for clever acting, and both
of the characters are well executed.
After the play a dance will be given
by the Masquers' Society at the Women's
Clubhouse. Good seats for the produc
tion can still be obtained at Crandall s
in Palo Alto and will be sold at tin/ box
office tonight.
