# MASQUERS' PLAY PROVES SUCCESS OF TYPE COMEDY
## Classed as "Most Ambitious of College Attempts"; All Characters Cleverly Chosen 
### Sam H. Winklebleck, '23 
Credit is due to the Masquers Dra
matic Society for producing on the
Stanford stage a comedy which is
heavier than the type of light and
airy farce, which seems to appeal to
a certain portion of college students.
The production of "Trelawney of the
Wells," as the San Francisco Chron
icle termed it, was a most ambitious
attempt at college dramatics. Al
though the more frivolous farce will
draw a larger crowd, those who at
tended the play Friday night formed
an appreciative audience.
Pinero's production, has its setting
in mid-Victorian times, depicting the
atrical life of that age as contrasted
with the life of nobility. The play is
a comedy of characters rather than
of situations and getting the right per
sons for the right parts was one of
the most serious problems in its
preparations. The work of the play
ers revealed the success of Coach
Gordon Davis in filling the places.
Beatrice Edmonds, in the lead, Rose
Trelawney, played her part with a
marked degree of ease and natural
ness. She was well fitted for the
role portraying without difficulty the
characterizations of the popular "Rose
of the Wells." The gowns worn by
Miss Edmonds were beautiful in their
mid-Victorian style and added to the
effectiveness of her acting.
Howard Wilson, playing opposite
Miss Edmonds in the part of Arthur
Gower, her lover, showed poise, and
the proper degree of sentimentality
in his acting. He carried his part
with a repression that added to the
sincerity of the character which he
was depicting. His gestures and pan
tomime were also in keeping with his
acting, not becoming too conspicuous,
but yet helping to carry out his part.
Imogene Parrott, the young lady in
the play who "fixes things up," was
taken by Florence Hocking. The part
was well cast and miss Hosking's
acting came up to the standard of the
remainder of the cast. She was
natural in her part and played it with
past standard of character work. She
was A. D. Cohan in the role of Tom
Wrench, a young playwright. Cohan's
first appearance in campus dramatics
was last Friday night and it can be
classed distinctly as successful.
Melba Berry, as usual, was cast in
the strongest woman character part.
She did well in her comic interpre
tation of the role, and came up to her
past standard character work. She
acted the part of Avonia Bunn, not
only in the lines of the manuscript
but at all times when on the stage.
Ferdinand Gadd, who marries Avo
nia, was played by Archie Steele. He
carried his part excellently and only
favorable criticism can be made of
him.
The part of Vice Chanccllor Sir
William Gower, an eccentric old
gentleman of the English nobility was
taken by Alwin Wendt, with remark
able talent. At all times Wendt, w.as
immersed in his part. His speech and
voice inflections, which was one of the
prime features of the part was hand
led well. His old maid sister, Tra
falgar, played by Virginia Woodruff,
was also rendered in keeping with the
time of the play.
The two main comedy parts, that of
Augustus Colpoys, Roy Riffle, and O'-
Dwyer, Eugene Curtis, could not have
been better cast. Riffle showed clever
character work and Curtis won favor
in both his character work and his
Irish brogue. Although Curtis' name
failed to appear in the cast of mem
bers on the program, he was the life
of the last act.
Other parts, Mr. and Mrs. Telfer.
taken by James Anglim, and Virginia
Lowers, Captain and Mrs. DeFoenix
played by Paul Beuter and Mary Jane
Clark, the comic character of Mr. Ab
lett, a grocer, by Hudson Proctor, and
the usual howling landlady, Mrs. Mos
sop, Fern Weaver, Miss Brewster and
Mr. Denzil, of the new school of act
ors, played by Margaret Lies and
Theodore sterling; Charles, a butler,
F. E. Wilson; the maid, Sarah, by
Katherine Taff; were well done and
deserve commendable mention.
The scenic arrangement of the play
was well designed and executed. The
Dramatic Council has again justified
its appointments for the plays pro
duced since its organization, and have
shown a distinct improvement in their
scenic arrangement over thoso of last
year.
