# ASSISTANT ATHLETIC MANAGERS SOUGHT; MANY TO COMPETE
## 
### 
An opportunity is still open for any
juniors, sophomores or freshmen who
are interested in trying out for the posi
tion of assistant athletic manager of any
major or minor sport on the campus.
Thus far the only athletic manager ap
pointed at Stanford is Washington Con
nolly, who will he in charge of all col
lege basketball. However, there are a
number of these positions to be filled,
and they must he filled at once, as there
is accumulated work that must be dis
posed of.
There are a large number of benefits
that will result for the athletic manager.
For instance, he will receive a regular
collegiate Stanford "S" bearing some
special distinction for his form of activ
ity; he will be able to accompany his
team on all its trips abount the country;
he will derive a large amount of experi
ence in meeting people and in handling
budgets.
In addition, there is the honor that
will result for the University from the
efficient handling of the work; and the
honor of the job for the manager him
self.
Any men who arc interested in trying
out should sec Ed. Martin any after
noon in the near future at the gym
nasium, as the opportunity will not be
held open much longer.
