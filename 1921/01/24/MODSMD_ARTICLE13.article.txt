# CARDINAL QUINTET WINS FROM WINGED "0" 145-LB. TEAM BY 39 TO 34 SCORE
## Stanford Varsity Goes Through the Pre' Conference Schedule With Clean Record 
### 
Coach Powell's varsity basketball team added another scalp to its rapidly
growing belt by defeating the 145-pound team of tha Olympic Club in the last
game of the preliminary season Saturday night. The score was 39 to 34.
As in the contest of the preceding Wednesday, the varsity did not come
through until the second half. The Olympics showed up with a fast outfit and
they gave the Cardinal a merry time during the first twenty minutes of play.
They were leading at half time 20 to 19.

Beginning the second half, the Stan
ford quintet jumped into the lead and
slowly crept away from the San Fran
cisco outfit, finally winning by five
points. The game was not so interesting
as it might have been because the referee
insisted upon holding the players to the
closest interpretation of basketball rules.
When things began to liven up a bit the
referee's whistle would sound, indicating
a personal or technical foul on some
player. Most of these fouls were not
apparent to the majority of onlookers,
and many were excusable becausc of
the rapidity of the play, but the official
insisted that "rules is ruks," with a re
sultant slowing up of the struggle.
Bert Mills was the largest individual
point-maker. He sent five through the
hoop from the field and converted nine
free throws out of a possible twelve.
Dick Richmond was up to bis usual
tricks and astonished the opposition by
dropping two long throws through tine
ring.
Righter and Davies played flashy baW
in the forward positions and contributed
