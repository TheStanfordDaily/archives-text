# DESTRUCTION FACES LAGUNITA BOATHOUSE; STUDENTS' AID ASKED
## 
### 
The Lagunita boathouse is in a de
plorable state of disrepair and the uni
versity authorities have served notice
that as it constitutes one of the worst
eyesores on the grounds it will be torn
down at once.
Sensing the impending danger, inter
ested parties, together wltli the Physical
Training Department, have taken it upon
themselves to save this structure of a
by-gone day. There arc no available
funds to devote to this purpose, but Dr.
Browne has been able to secure dona
tions of all necessary materials and of a
certain amount of skilled labor. The
only other reqnisite required is the
united strength of a number of campus
men. Dr. Browne intends detailing hi*
4 to 6 gymnasium classes on this Tues
day and Wednesday to the work. They
will meet in front of the postofficc at
4:10 on these days and proceed in a
group to the lake. This includes, in addi
tion to the regular gym classes, the
handball, volleyball, and swimming
classes. Every man in these classes must
report.
Then, on Saturday afternoon, alt fra
ternity and hall men who arc on the
"boat" and are anxious for a bigger,
better Stanford, are asked to come to
the lake ready to work. .
Dr. Browne has quite an extensive
program of repairs in mind to make the
! oathouse a worthy and serviceable in
stitution on the campus here. He in
tends to dig a sewer and put modern
sanitary fixtures inside; replace the
broken windows throughout; wire the
boathouse with electricity; put in several
partitions and a number of new wooden
lockers.
The university has agreed to furnish
sufficient boats in addition to six that
will be supplied by individual students.
A splendid bathing beach will be pro
vided and a couple,of students will room
there to act as permanent caretakers
The result will be that the boathouse
will be a tiling of beauty and diversion
to the students and a credit to the uui
versity during the spring and summer
months this year.
