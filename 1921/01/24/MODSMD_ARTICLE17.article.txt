## 
### 
Stanford's basketball varsity today
went through its last practice before the
first conference struggle with Oregon
Agricultural College tomorrow night at
Encina Gymnasium.
Reports from the north are to the ef
fect that the Corvallis team is excep
tionally strong and should give Stan
ford its hardest contest thus far this
season. The visitors were expected to
arrive on the campus late today.
Coach Powell probably will start the
same team that opened against the
Olympic Club 145-pound team Saturday
night. "Lefty" Rogers, who has showed
promising form during the past few
weeks and who played well against the
Olympics Saturday probably will start
the O. A. C. battle at forward, with
Davies ready to relieve him in the sec
ond half. This plan has worked to ad
vantage, as Davies' speed is needed in
the last part of the game when the op
position is tiring.
Captain Freddy Adams is certain to
be at his usual place at standing guard.
Mills at center, "Swede" Rightcr at
forward, and Richmond at guard arc
also sure to start.
The game will start at 8 o'clock, ac
cording to word from the graduate
manager's office today. There will be
