# WHAT OREGON SAYS

The University of Oregon Daily Emerald has the following to say
in reference to the announcement of the formation of the "Big Three,"
and the recent publication of the Stanford football schedule:
"Stanford has announced its 1921 football schedule, which will per
haps cause a few to see a light. Of seven games scheduled, all but one
arc to be played at Palo Alto. One game is scheduled for Seattle with
â€¢the University of Washington. California and Washington will prob
ably announce similar schedules soon, and it is safe to predict that the
jiumber of games played off the campus in these two schools will be
correspondingly low. Who was it that said the "Big Three" wasn't to
set up a dictatorial policy towards other coast institutions?"
