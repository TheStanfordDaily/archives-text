Weary roughs on the Engineering
Corner will no longer have to stand as
they loiter watching the co-eds pass and
repass. For Saturday, under the com
bined efforts of the Civil and Mechanical
Engineering Societies, the engineering
bench was set in place and is now ready
for use whenever the weather permits.
Now the only question is will the bench
accommodate all those who wish to rest
upon its inviting concrete surface, for
although the seat is twenty feet long,
and allowing a foot per man. it will
take care of twenty, who has seen the
time when in fair weather there were
not more than twenty engineers stand
ing around on the corner.
