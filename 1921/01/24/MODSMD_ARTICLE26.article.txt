# CABBAGES AND THINGS

### 
<$> T. 1., '23 <S>
Bills have been introduced into the
state legislature to prohibit hip pock
ets, to close all pool halls and caba
rets at nine, to fine a man for snor
ing, to make it a misdemeanor to
wear a red necktie in public, but the
worst blow, of all is the proposed pro
hibition of chewing gum in Kansas.
The Jayhawkers are already bootleg
ging booze and cigarettes, and now
somebody wants to make the state
safe for Spearmint on-the-sly dis
pensers.

An eastern newspaper tells its read
ers that Morris Kirksey, the Stanford
splinter, predicts a successful track
season. A chip off the old block—
what?

Word comes from the south that
Paddock is out on the track. He re
cently declared that lie wouldn't com

count of businesss pressure. Business
must be poor.

"If Calden's leg is O. K., if Merch

heavy, if Sprott has not been slowed
up by football, and if the climate
does not affect the whole team, Cali

pion track team of America." —"Brick"

More bills. Demaslado bills. That
one on snoring has a mean penalty.
It reads as follows. "Snoring, talking
in one's sleep, or otherwise disturbing
the family and neighborhood peace
after 1 a.m., shall be punishable to
the following penalties: " —loss of
breakfast for the first offense, living
with mother-in-law for a certain num
ber of days, and fiines ranging from
$100 to $300 for the third and suc.ess
ive offenses. No doubt the future will
provide for the meting out of the death
