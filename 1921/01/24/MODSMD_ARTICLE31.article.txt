THE ORDEAL OF MARK TWAIN.
By Van Wyck Brooks. Dutton, 1920.
The author of this remarkable volume
will he remembered by many Stanford
and Palo Alto' people not only from his
being an instructor in the English De
partment from 1912 to 1915, but from
his visits to Carmcl since that time. It
was during a two-years' visit to that
literary and artistic center that Mr.
Brooks wrote this last and most import
ant of his essays.
The somewhat startling theory ad
vanced in "The Ordeal of Mark Twain"
cannot be justly stated in a few words.
To take it away from the good-sized
volume in which it is formulated and
defended would be to subject it to cheap
ridicule, whereas the mass of evidence
which Mr. Brooks brings out deserves
a most serious and respectful hearing.
How shall one account for the in
tense and rampant pessimism of Mark
Twain? He was wonderfully robust
and well; he made several fortunes by
the sale of his books; he was enormously
popular—honored, feted, lionized by
kings and conquerors and famous poets;
he was buoyant and light-hearted by na
ture; he was happily married; and his
sense of humor should have enabled him
to overcome any other conceivable cause
for taking a gloomy view of life when
all these things were in his favor. Yet
in his later years a savage and bitter
pessimism swayed and tormented him.
Whether one agrees with Mr. Brooks
that Mark Twain was born to be a far
greater figure in the world's literature
than he became, or that his humor was
merely the result of a hopeless dilemma ;
and not native to his genius, he cannot
set aside Mr. Brooks' most original !
hypotheosis until he is prepared to offer '
some more rational accounting for j
Mdrk Twain's pessimism than he will
find in these brilliant and fascinating
pages.
