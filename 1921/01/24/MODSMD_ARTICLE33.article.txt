# Cosmopolitan Club Plans Filipino Entertainment
## 
### 
The Cosmopolitan Club plans another
Oriental entertainment, "Filipino
Night," to take place (this) Monday
evening at 8 o'clock in the reception
room of the Women's Clubhouse. Mem
bers of the local Filipino Club have
prepared the program, which will be
characterized by native music, singing
and dancing. The meeting will only be
open to those who are already mem
bers, who have applied for membership,
and those who would like to join the
organization.
"Chinese Night," which was given by
the Chinese Club two weeks ago, with
the assistance of some imported talent
amid an excellent scheme of decoration,
was a big success, and it is expected
that the Filipinos will try to outdo the
Chinese for elaborateness.
Thirty-four applications for member
ship were received at the last meeting,
and these will he voted on in order at
a special business meeting to be held at
7:15. All active members are asked to
be present, because there is much im
portant business to be considered.
