# CAMPUS BASKETEERS ALTER SCHEDULE OF INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
Changes in the intramural basketball
schedule have been made on account of
the varsity games with the Oregon
Aggies tomorrow and Wednesday
nights. Because the bleachers will be
up for the varsity games on these after
noons the small courts cannot be used.
This leaves only the large court for the
intramural games, and consequently
only one game can be played each
afternoon.
The Theta Cliis will meet the Phi
Delta Gammas Tuesday afternoon.
Wednesday the Encina East Third
quintet will tackle the Medics.
The other games originally slated for
Tuesday and Wednesday in the second
and seventh leagues will be played next
Saturday afternoon.
Teams of League 8 play today, start
ing off the fourth round. The games
this afternoon are between the Kappa
Sigmas and Encina East Second; Encina
East First and Phi Kappa Sigmas;
Kappa Alphas vs. Delta Kappa Epsilon.
The latter contest promises to be a close
one. Both the Kappa Alphas and the
Dekes have won two out of three games.
The winner of this afternoon's alterca
tion will hold second place in League 8.
Results of Friday's battle in League
8 are: Kappa Sigma 2, Encina East
FirstO; Phi Kappa Sigma 2, Kappa
Alpha 0; Encina East Second 0, Delta
Kappa Epsilon 2. All these games were
forfeited. The standings of teams in
this league at the close of the third
series are:
Team— W. L. Pet.
Kappa Sigma 3 0 1000
Phi Kappa Sigma 2 1 .667
Delta Kappa Epsilon 2 1 .667
Kappa Alpha 2 1 .667
Encina East First 0 3 .000
Encina East Second 0 3 .000
The Chi Psis took the lead in League
3 Saturday by defeating the El Campo
team 13 to 12. Neither team had been
defeated up to Saturday, and both quin
tets fought hard to maintain a 1000 per
cent standing. A foul in the first few
minutes of play proved to be the de
ciding factor, each team shooting six
baskets.
Two teams failed to appear Saturday.
Theta Xi forfeited to Zeta Psi, and
Sequoia First and Fourth defaulted to
Sequoia Second. Percentages in League
3 stand as follows:
Team— IW. L. Pet.
Chi Psi 3 0 1000
El Campo 2 0 .667
Zeta Psi 2 0 .667
Theta Xi 1 2 .333
Sequoia Second 1 2 .333
Sequoia Ist and 4th 0 3 .000
in League 7 were not
changed by Saturday's games. Encina
East Third still leads that group.
Quintets thus far undefeated are
Alpha Kappa Lambda, Theta Chi, Phi
Gamma Delta, Chi Psi, Alpha lau
Omega, Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta,
Encina East Third, Kappa Sigma. Two
more rounds will be played in the pre
liminary tournament. Then the winners
in each league will battle for the campus
title.
