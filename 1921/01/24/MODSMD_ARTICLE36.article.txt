# STUDENT OPINION IS DISCIPLINE USED AT OREGON UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Student opinion is the only discip
line used in the honor system in
operation at the law school of the
University of Oregon. It is, however,
more of a true honor system than the
student policing system, according to
Dean William G. Hale.
"My opinion," says Dean Hale, "is
that if a student, to the knowledge of
his classmates, violates his honor, the
group would practically ostracize the
offender. The force of public opinion
in the group will help to keep the
weak student in line, and if he does
not remain in line, it will have the
effect of driving him from the uni
versity."
Professor W. C. Dalzell, formerly
an instructor at Stanford, but now
with the northern university, in talk
ing of the honor system with Uni
versity of Oregon law students said
that he remembered of only one case
of cheating under the Stanford system
as he knew it and in that case the
students refused to have anything to
do with the offender, until he found
it so uncomfortable that he finally
left college.
