# SOCCER TEAM WINS 2-1 VICTORY FROM AMERICAN LEGION
## 
### 
Stanford soccer varsity continued
its record of no defeats this season
by beating the Palo Alto Legion team
Saturday afternoon with one point to
spare—2 to 1. Stanford still heads the
Soccer League, and indications are
that it will continue to do so when the
season comes to a close.
The game, as the score indicates,
was a close one, and the Legion team
showed up better than had been ex
pected, considering the fact that it
has not had the advantage of prac
tice together such as the varsity has
had throughout the season. Although
there was good feeling on both sides,
naturally, the contest was no easy one
for Stanford to win, and it was an
interesting game from the standpoint
of the spectators.
During the first half the Legion
team threw a surprise when they play
ed the varsity off their feet and when
the half closed, were leading, 1 to 0.
They kept the ball constantly in Stan
ford territory, and showed some fine
work in rushing the varsity forward
lino and backfield. Peavy scored the
goal.
The second half proved to be Cardi
nal meat, however, and before the
proceedings were over, two points had
taken the place of that zero, Weller
scoring both of them. It looked very
much as if all the Legion team, lacked
was condition and wind, for that can
very well account for their slowing
up in the last part of the game. The
varsity, having played a long hard
schedule already, had every one of its
ment in fine shape to withstand a
hard rushing game.
It was virtually a case of two Stan
ford teams against each other, and
no matter how it came out, there is

cause for Stanford rejoicing. The
Legion team had many expert soccer
ites in its line-up. Dr. llrowne and
Coach Harry Maloney starred in the
backfield and forward line, respective
ly and former Stanford men such as
Price, Jim Adams, and Quinby showed
decisively that they had not forgotten
how to play.
As a result of this and other games
played over the week-end, the League
standing is practically the same as
last Monday. Stanford »till leads all
comers, with the Olympics one point
behind. The Winged O men won
their game Saturday from the Italian
team, and California took another
step downward when she lost, 1 to 0,
to the Chinese Y. M. C. A. California
meets the Olympics next Saturday, and
prospects for a Blue and Gold victory
do not look bright. Stanford will be
rooting for her, however, as every
Olympic defeat means just a little
closer grip on top place for the Cardi
nals.

naturally, the contest was no easy one
for Stanford to win, and it was an
interesting game from the standpoint
of the spectators.
During the first half the Legion
team threw a surprise when they play
ed the varsity off their feet and when
the half closed, were leading, 1 to 0.
They kept the ball constantly in Stan
ford territory, and showed some fine
work in rushing the varsity forward
lino and backfield. Peavy scored the
goal.
The second half proved to be Cardi
nal meat, however, and before the
proceedings were over, two points had
taken the place of that zero, Weller
scoring both of them. It looked very
much as if all the Legion team, lacked
was condition and wind, for that can
very well account for their slowing
up in the last part of the game. The
varsity, having played a long hard
schedule already, had every one of its
ment in fine shape to withstand a
hard rushing game.
It was virtually a case of two Stan
ford teams against each other, and
no matter how it came out, there is

cause for Stanford rejoicing. The
Legion team had many expert soccer
ites in its line-up. Dr. llrowne and
Coach Harry Maloney starred in the
backfield and forward line, respective
ly and former Stanford men such as
Price, Jim Adams, and Quinby showed
decisively that they had not forgotten
how to play.
As a result of this and other games
played over the week-end, the League
standing is practically the same as
last Monday. Stanford »till leads all
comers, with the Olympics one point
behind. The Winged O men won
their game Saturday from the Italian
team, and California took another
step downward when she lost, 1 to 0,
to the Chinese Y. M. C. A. California
meets the Olympics next Saturday, and
prospects for a Blue and Gold victory
do not look bright. Stanford will be
rooting for her, however, as every
Olympic defeat means just a little
closer grip on top place for the Cardi
nals.
