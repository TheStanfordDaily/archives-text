# Powell Calls Meeting of Coaches to Get Viewpoint on Rules
## 
### 
Coach Walter Lowell, who was re
cently made a member of the na
tional rules committee on football, has
written J. R. Klawans, President of
the Pacific Coast Football Associa
tion, suggesting a meeting of the
association to discuss any changes
officials on the coast may desire him
to recommend when the national rules
committee meets in the near future.
It is the purpose of Powell to go
over the rules with coaches, officials,
and referees on the Pacific Coast so
that when he goes East to attend the
big meeting he will be able to present
the views of the coast football men
on any changes that are contemplated.
Klawans has written Powell ask
ing him to set a date for the meet
ing in which case he will then sum
mon all officials and coaches to be
present and air any ideas they may
have on the subject.
Harry Braddock, an official and
member of the Pacific Coast Foot
ball Association, has expressed the
opinion that it would be a good idea
to eliminate the kick after a touch
down.
