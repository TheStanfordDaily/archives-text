# COMMERCE HIGH FALLS BEFORE SEAY'S QUINTET
## The 						Babe Five Puts Visilors to Sleep by the Large Score of 24-7, in Speedy Contest 
### 
Tn a one-sided contest last Saturday
night the freshman quintet defeated the
Commerce High School five by a score
of 24-7. The game was scheduled to
take place at 7 o'clock, but owing to a
misunderstanding the high school lads
did not show up until nearly an hour
later. As the game was only a prelim
inary to the varsity contest, and as they
were nearly ready to come on the court,
it was necessary to play ten-minute
halves. Considering this, the freshmen
ran up a very high score against their
opponents.
The first half was featured by good
passing on the part of the high school
players, and had they been a little more
accurate in their basket-shooting the
score would have undoubtedly balanced
up better. At first it looked as though
the Babes would be taken off their feet
by the speedy prep school, but very soon
they got together and romped away with
the first half of the game by a score
of 10-2.
Coming back for the second half, a
great improvement in teamwork was
shown on the part of the freshmen. This
seemed to break up the short passing
game of their rivals, for along towards
the latter part of the game the Com
merce players became unorganized. Good
guarding on both sides caused the for
wards to take longer shots for the bas
ket. The most of these shots lacked
altitude and they netted the freshmen
only fourteen points to the visitors five.
This made the total score 24-7.
Two men that have been showing up
well in the last few games arc Smith
and Atwill. They are at present holding
down standing and running guards, re
spectively. Smith's position is a very
difficult one to play properly, and it has
been largely through him that the teams
that the freshmen have played have had
such low scores. Atwill adds greatly
to the teamwork of the team and his
occasional long shots generally tally.
The lineup follows:
Stanford—McHose, f.; Granger, f.;
Jensen, c.; Smith, g.; Atwill, g.
Commerce —Lawless, f.; Costa, f.;
Pavntcr, c.; Sullivan, g.; Bclasco, g.
