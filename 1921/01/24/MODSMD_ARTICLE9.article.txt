# INTRAMURAL TEAMS TO BEGIN SOCCER SERIES
## 
### 
Rival intramural soccer teams,
weather permitting, begin today a
series of battles to detrmine the sur
vival of the fittest. Six teams have
been entered in the lists, and from all
indications, the games will be close
and interesting to watch.
The teams are scheduled to play one
game each on Monday, Tuesday and
Thursday. I?y this arrangement there
will be three games each day, and by
the time all nine games have been
played, it should not be difficult to
pick the winner.
