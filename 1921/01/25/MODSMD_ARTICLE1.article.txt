# VARSITY MEETS AGGIES IN FIRST CONFERENCE COURT CONTEST TONIGHT
## Freshman Quintet Is Scheduled For Game with University High Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford plays its first Conference
court game tonight with the Oregon
Aggies, after having completed the pre
liminary schedule unbeaten. The north
ern team arrived on the campus this
afternoon, bringing with them an en
viable reputation and a determination
to hang the Cardinal scalp on the O.
A. C. victory belt. The Oregon quintet
is reputed to be stronger than usual this
year, but Coach Powell's men are doped
to maintain an unmarred score-sheet,
although they expect to be pressed to
the limit.

A single night of practice has followed
the Olympic game last Saturday, which
will probably mean the choosing of the
same lineup. In the first half Righter
and Rogers will probably go in as for
wards, Mills center, and Richmond and
Adams guards. Davies will undoubt
edly replace Rogers at forward at the
beginning of the second half, in accord
ance with the practice followed in the
last two contests.

The second game of the series will
be played tomorrow night. After hav
ing an opportunity to look over the
opposing lineup, Coach Powell may
effect a few changes in the Cardinal, but
the best possible combination is thought
to have been found now.

Tonight's contest will start at 7:30,
in order to allow guests to attend the
symphony concert after the game. The
admission will be 25 cents in addition
to the student body card, and 75 cents
to outsiders.

The freshman basketballers meet the
University High School of Berkeley to
morrow night here at 7 p. m. The team
from across the bay has some fast mem
bers in its make-up and has had some
good preliminary games with the other
teams from the Berkeley district. The
last team from the northern territory
that came here, Oakland Technical
High, gave the Babes a hard workout,
and the boys from University High are
expected to be in better shape than the
other team.

The University High School enjoys
the privilege of frequent attendance at
the games of the University of Califor
nia and get good practitce under the
supervision of members of the college
teams. They have in the past always put
up a strong game to the first-year teams
here and are said to have a fast and
smooth-working team this season.

The Babes are in better shape than in
any of the preliminary games. Constant,
practice with the varsity and the nightly
workouts of the squad under Duffy
Seay's eye have given them teamwork
and a better attack than they have ex
hibited in earlier games, and they are
ready to put up a speedy game tomorrow
night for the onlookers. The same line
up as in previous games will probably
be used.

A. C. victory belt. The Oregon quintet
is reputed to be stronger than usual this
year, but Coach Powell's men are doped
to maintain an unmarred score-sheet,
although they expect to be pressed to
the limit.

A single night of practice has followed
the Olympic game last Saturday, which
will probably mean the choosing of the
same lineup. In the first half Righter
and Rogers will probably go in as for
wards, Mills center, and Richmond and
Adams guards. Davies will undoubt
edly replace Rogers at forward at the
beginning of the second half, in accord
ance with the practice followed in the
last two contests.

The second game of the series will
be played tomorrow night. After hav
ing an opportunity to look over the
opposing lineup, Coach Powell may
effect a few changes in the Cardinal, but
the best possible combination is thought
to have been found now.

Tonight's contest will start at 7:30,
in order to allow guests to attend the
symphony concert after the game. The
admission will be 25 cents in addition
to the student body card, and 75 cents
to outsiders.

The freshman basketballers meet the
University High School of Berkeley to
morrow night here at 7 p. m. The team
from across the bay has some fast mem
bers in its make-up and has had some
good preliminary games with the other
teams from the Berkeley district. The
last team from the northern territory
that came here, Oakland Technical
High, gave the Babes a hard workout,
and the boys from University High are
expected to be in better shape than the
other team.

The University High School enjoys
the privilege of frequent attendance at
the games of the University of Califor
nia and get good practitce under the
supervision of members of the college
teams. They have in the past always put
up a strong game to the first-year teams
here and are said to have a fast and
smooth-working team this season.

The Babes are in better shape than in
any of the preliminary games. Constant,
practice with the varsity and the nightly
workouts of the squad under Duffy
Seay's eye have given them teamwork
and a better attack than they have ex
hibited in earlier games, and they are
ready to put up a speedy game tomorrow
night for the onlookers. The same line
up as in previous games will probably
be used.
