# ENGLISH CLUB TO PLAY "THE YELLOW JACKET" IN MARCH
## Tryouts Will Be Tomorrow for the Oriental Drama; Cast To have Character Types 
### 
"The Yellow Jacket," a Chinese play
done in a Chinese manner, will be
produced by the English Club early
in March. Tryouts for this popular
oriental drama will be held tomorrow
afternoon from 2 to 4 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall; from 4 to 6 o'clock
in the Little Theater, and in the
evening from 8 to 10 o'clock in the
Little Theater.

"I want everyone who has ever
been in a play and everyone who has
ever wanted to be in a play to tryout,"
says Coach Gordon Davis. "There
are twenty-eight characters in the
cast and we will need every person
we can get with any dramatic ability."

"The Yellow Jacket" is one of the
most popular Chinese plays ever writ
ten. It is one of the best recommed
ed dramas of modern playwrights.
Clayton Hamilton, one of the most
renouned play critics says, "It is the
most remarkable artistic achievement
of the present season," and Charles
Frohman prophecLes, "It is a wonder
ful play and will be seen all over the
world."
The drama is novelty throughout.
It is presented in a Chinese manner
and has both music and dance. The

manner of presentation is amusing
and the emotional qualities of oriental
skit are strenghtened by the incidental
music which follows the action of
the play. The Boston Transcript
terms the play "A rare and marvelous
entertainment."

Coach Gordon Davis, who will be in
charge of the production, is assured
of the worth of the clever composi
tion, as he played the leading role
last summer at Carmel-by-the-Sea. "It
will be one of the most pretentious
plays of the year," says Davis, "and
at present the whole success of this
drama lies in the number who turn
out for the tryouts tomorrow."
