# ALFRED HERTZ TO OFFER SYMPHONY PROGRAM TONIGHT
## San Francisco Orchestra Will Play in Assembly Hall; Glee Club to Appear in Concert 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
The program which will be given by
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
under the direction of Alfred Hertz in
the Assembly Hall this evening at 8:15
will open with Weber's romantic over
ture, "Oberon," instead of
"Egmont." Mr. Hertz has chosen this
number because it fits so beautifully into
the two movements of Schubert's "Un
finished Symphony," which follows. The
"Military March" of Schubert, and
which will be used as a finale for the
symphony, will conclude a group of four
numbers so admirably chosen that the
effect will be that of a complete symph
ony in four movements. The romantic
suggestion of these pieces and the clarity
and simplicity of their melodies will
make them highly interesting and ap
pealing to every student with imagina
tion.

The three numbers by the- Glee Clul)
will afford a novel contest. The forty
members have worked hard under the
direction of their director, Warren D
Allen, and will endeavyr to make their
part of the program as artistic as pos
sible.
Variations on a Russian melody by six
different Russian composers, and the
"Prelude" and "Liebestad" from Wag
ner's "Tristan and Isolde" will conclude
an interesting and inspiring program.
