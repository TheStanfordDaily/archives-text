# Prices Are Reduced at University of Kansas
## 
### 
Following a boycott by the students
of the University of Kansas of the
retail merchants, resulting in a mark
ed drop in prices, a movement for re
duction in the price of board has been
started. Boarding houses in the vi
cinity of the campus have been charg
ing $7.50 a week, which many consider
too high a price to pay in view of
the reduction in retail prices. The
present rate is an increase ot nearly
100 per cent over pre-war prices.
No concerted action has been taken
as yet, although the campus paper,
which led in the boycott on the mer
chants, is conducting a vigorous cam
paign.
