# PUBLIC INITIATIONS
## 
### 
Public initiations arc prohibited by a University ruling, but lately
campus organizations have shown a tendency to overstep the letter of the
law and bring their initiations to the attention of the public in some form
or other. A. recent ease has brought the matter before the Men's Council,
and that body has issued a statement warning against the public appear
ance of any body of initiates that can be construed as an initiation.
The ruling against initiations was made by the University in the
first place for obvious reasons. Stanford was gaining a certain amount
of undesirable publicity from the antics performed by the initiates of the
various campus societies that did real harm to the name of the University,
and two or three especially so-called clever initiations caused the Univer
sity to absolutely prohibit public initiations in any form.
It is a natural tendency for an organization to wish rest of the cam
pus to know that it is initiating and to let the public know who its neo
phytes arc, but since public initiations are expressly forbidden, and the
Men's Council will construe the public appearance of any body of neo
phytes as an initiation, it is safest for all organizations to keep their in
itiations strictly private, if violations of the rule will bring severe pen
alties to tbe offenders.
