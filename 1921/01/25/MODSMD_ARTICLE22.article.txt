## 
### 
Members of the student body who have spare time at their disposal
will find their services welcome at the boathouse on the Lake, where the
physical training classes, under the supervision of Dr. A. D. Browne are
engaged in repairing the structure. The building has been condemned by
the University authorities and was to be torn down in a short time, but
Dr. Browne has undertaken to save the structure by putting it in such
good shape that it will be a real improvement. A diving platform will be
installed, and various other changes made that will require the services of
a number of students. The work will be finished on Saturday, and Dr.
Browne has asked for the aid of a large number of freshmen on that day.
