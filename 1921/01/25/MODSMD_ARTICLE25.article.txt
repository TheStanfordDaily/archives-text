# J. P. MITCHELL ACTIVE IN STUDENT AFFAIRS
## 
### 
John Pearce Mitchell, professor in
the Department of Chemistry, is a man
! who has always been active in Stanford
student affairs. He graduated from
Stanford himself in 1903 and has been
connected with the University ever since
that time. Since October he has been in
charge of the work of the Lower Divi
sion, which has brought about an even
closer contact with the students.
As treasurer of the Board of Athletic
Control, Professor Mitchell has straight
ened the affairs of that organization so
that within another year the debt of
$15,000, incurred in 1917, will be paid off.
He has brought about a reorganization
of that board, working on a budget
system.
Whenever the financial workings of a
Stanford undertaking have been in a
poor state, Professor Mitchell has been
called in. The result is that student or
ganizations' funds are now cared for by
a central bookkeeping office. The object
of this has been to bring about a conti
nuity of management and to give pub
licity to the reports of the various stu
dent enterprises. It has brought about
the publication this year for the first
time of a report of the finances of the
student organizations.
The centralization of this work began
while Professor Mitchell was a member
of the Board of Athfctic Control and of
the Stanford Union. The co-ordination
of these two came first and then the
general grouping of all student activi
ties. S.

The workings of the Lower Division,
a system installed here in the autumn
quarter, have been placed in Professor
Mitchell's hands. Although the plan is
but an experiment, he believes that it is
working out to be highly satisfactory to
both students and faculty.
While he/has always been actively en
gaged in work of this kind at Stanford, ]
the professor's real vocation is the •
Chemistry Department. Water analysis
and smelter smoke problems have been "
his principal interests. He has pub- •
lished several papers along these lines,
one of them being a report of the com- "
position of the local water supplies. He «
has been a member of commissions to \
deal with the problem of the injury -of j
smelter smoke to vegetation.
Professor Mitchell secured his A. B. !
in chemistry in 1903 and an A. M. degree '
the following year. In 1905 he became .
an instructor in the department and has j
been working up to his present position ■
ever since. In 1909 he was given the .
degree of Ph. D. During most of this ]
time, except for an interval of a few ■
years, lie was a member of the board .
controlling the Students' Guild. v
Professor Mitchell was born in Provi
dence, Rhode Island, but came West in
1887, when he was still very young.
After spending some years in Southern
California his family moved to Palo
Alto and he attended school at Belmont
before entering Stanford.
He is a member of Delta Upsilon fra
ternity.
