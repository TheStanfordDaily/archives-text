their pictures taken for the junior
section of the Quad is in sight, Editor
Ross Fisher this morning announced.
I Over four-fifths of the Juniors have
j had their pictures taken, and the
Quad management expects to clean
up the remaining pictures iy record
time.
White the editor desires to make
tlie Junior Section an inclusive photo
graphic record of the class it will be
impossible to give the juniors an in
definite time in which they may re
port to the studio. Fisher plans to
announce in a few days a closing date
after which no pictures for the sec
tion can be taken.
As Davey's Studio has assured the
Quad that it is prepared to accommo
date a large number of people, juniors
desiring a sitting can easily make the
necessary arrangements with the
studio.
The response of the sorority houses
to the call for pictures has been
generous. Nearly one-half of the
members of the houses have reported
to Davey's. Fisher is handling the
sorority pictures tiirough the presi
dents of the houses. He has requested
that trie heads of the chapters person
ally check up the members and urge
them to immediately make the neces
sary arrangements with the studio.
