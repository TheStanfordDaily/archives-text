# WELL-KNOWN ATHLETE IS FEDERAL STUDENT
## 
### 
With tho registration this quarter
of Alva W. Richards, Olympic games
champion, Stanford has added to her
list another man who has written his
namo among world-famous athletes.
Richards, who was a lieutenant in the
Army during the war, is a Federal
Vocational Training student and is
registered in the pre-medical depart
ment.
In the Olympic Games of 1912, held
at Stockholm, Richards won first
place in the high jump, beating out
George Horine, '13, who had previous
ly broken the world's record at Stan
ford. In the Inter-Allied games in
1918, he won places in many events
and received so many medals, it was
said, that he was in clanger of dropping
some when he shook hands with
General Pershing.
For a time Richards was stationed
at Camp Fremont, and with Harry
Maloney had charge of the athletic
activities there. He is, fortunately
for "Hrick Muller," ineligible for in
tercollegiate athletics, or else ho
would give the Berkeley man a hard
tussle for first honors in the high
jump.
