# TENNIS SQUAD WILL RESUME WORK AS SOON AS WEATHER IMPROVES
## 
### 
Competition for places on the var
sity and freshman tennis teams will
be resumed as soon as weather per
mits. All members of the freshman
classes who are signed up for the
sport are expected to spend one hour j
in the gymnasium for every cut on
the courts. Roll will be taken in the
apparatus room of Encina Gymnasium,
corresponding with the outdoor
classes.
Tennis prospects are exceedingly
bright this year on both freshman and
varsity turnouts. 'Jim' Davies, holder
Intercollegiate championships in both
of the Coast Conference
singles and doubles is playing in im
proved form and promises to give a
against California, to be held at the
good account of himself in the meet
close of the present quarter. "Skee"
Turner, L. S. Fish and Ford Tussing,
members of last season's racquet
team have been rapidly mastering
their strokes and have improved in
experience and play over last year.
Ted Mertz, '23, a transfer from the
University of Chicago is a player of
exceptional merit who though not
eligible for collegiate competition will
try for a nook on the inter-club game.
Prospects among the freshman play
ers who have been showing up well
are Richard Hinckley, and Norman De-
Back, who are ranked omong the lead
ing junior payers of the country.
Ernest . Greppin, Edward Berry, Al'
Huneke, J. C. McHose and Robzert
Edwards are making competition for
places on the freshman team very
keen.
The exact date for the freshman
tournament against California has not
been set definitely, but will be played
before the second week of April. As
the facilities for practice and for play
are limited, members of both squads
jare urged to make up all time lost
I through bad weather.
