# 1924 SOCCER TEAM TO PLAY PALO ALTO HIGH
## 
### 
I ■
At 4 o'clock this afternoon on the
varsity field the freshmen
team will meet the eleven from the
Palo Alto Hogh School. This will be
the fifth game in the series which is
being played with the high school.
So far both teams have won one and
I tied two of the former contests and
■today's game will settle the champion
i ship. The local prep school has a
fast team this year and has given
the freshmen many hard battles. Re
cently, however, several new players
have been added to the Stanford line
up so they should have a little trouble
in defeating their opponents in this,
the championship match.
