The Theta Chis and Phi Gamma
£ Deltas, leading teams in League 2, play
£ on the large court this afternoon. The
h bleachers being up for the*game with
' the Oregon Aggies tonight, deprives the
• intramural teams of the use of the
• small courts, so only one game can be
I played this afternoon. Neither team has
• been defeated so far, and today's con
w test is expected to draw an unusual
I number of spectators to see which team
■ is to lead the second l&ague.
• Playing on the large court will give
I the quintets a chance to show their
teamwork. This was impossible on the
• small courts. Coach C. S. Botsford
I points out that the new stadium will be
• a great benefit to intramural basketball
• in this regard, providing three new
full-size courts. Stanford will then have
| the best equipment for intramural bas
• ketball on the coast. This, Botsford
| thinks, will be an important factor in
| developing future varsity teams.
Tomorrow afternoon the Medics and
Encina East Third, the best two teams
• of League 7, will battle on the large
■ court. This will also be a hard fight.
\ Neither team has been defeated, the
" Medics losing one decision through de
• fault.
