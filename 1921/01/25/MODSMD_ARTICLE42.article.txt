# PHILIPPINE DANCING FEATURED BY NATIVES
## 
### 
Dancing and music given in native
Philippine style made a unique enter
tainment for the Cosmopolitan Club last
night in the Women's Clubhouse. More
than a hundred members of the club
were present. Part of the entertainment
was furnished by Filipinos who came
over from the Base Hospital.
A gorgeous color scheme was the
chief feature of the decorations, which
equaled those of "Chinese Night" given
by the Chinese members two weeks ago.
Last night's program was directed en
tirely by the Filiopino members of the
club.
