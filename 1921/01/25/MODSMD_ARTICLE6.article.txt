# Palo Alto High School Drive Includes Campus
## 
### 
The students of the Palo Alto High
School, who are making a drive to
raise $2,000 for the improvement of
the grounds of the school, have ex
tended the field of their activities to
include the campus.

The local high school, which was
completed in 1919, is regarded by
many authorities as the most beauti
ful in California, but the grounds sur
rounding it are sadly in need of im
provement. Owing to a lack of the
necessary funds for the work, the
boys have promised to give all the
necessary labor, and, in addition, the
whole school is making a drive for
the money with which to start the
work.
Graduates of the local school who
now attend Stanford arc appealed to
especially in the plea for funds. Con
tributions of from 50 cents upwards
may be sent or given to Allan Charles,
251 Lincoln Ave., who is in charge
of the drive.
