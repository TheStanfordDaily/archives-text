# Women of U. C. Would Rather Have Career Than Quick Marriage
## 
### 
The co-eds attending the University
of California todiv are admittedly mote
concerned with their future vocations
in life than with the kind or number of
their husbands.

This most astonishing of facts in this
ag«: of youthful romance is attested to
by no less a personage than Miss Lucy
Stebbins, dean of women at the Berke
ley institution. She proceeds further to
enlighten an astonished world by saying
that the girls do not banish thoughts of
wedded bliss for all time, but simply
until they render themselves independent
of "mere man" in a material sense.
"Don't think for a minute that all our
college girls are old maids, for they are
not," Miss Stebbins hastens to explain.
"But it seems that they are no longer
satisfied to step directly from the class
room into a home of their own. The
college girl today wants to feel her own
independence and wants to test her
ability to take her place as a self
supporting member of society.
"This new college girl, who takes her
place side bv side with the men of the
business and professional v/orld is
merely a product of the times, that's
all. Certain economic conditions have
made her. and when the test has come
she has not been found wanting. How
does this affect the success of matri
mony when she does not enter it? Our
university has not delved deeply into
that question. We are merely concerned
in seeing that the girls who went to
make their own way in life are given
every opportunity for success,"
