"The time is propitious for the ad
vance of the University of California to
a pre-eminent place among the institu
tions of the world," declares President
David P. Barrows in his report sub
mitted to Governor W. D. Stephens for
the year of 1920-21.
He whole heartedly opposes any at
tempt to establish a separate colloge of
agriculture. His argument is in part
that "the proponents of this measure
point to the fact that most Western
states have two state institutions, a uni
versity and a college of agrciulture and
mechanic arts. Without exception this
subdivision lias resulted in duplication
of plants and staff, waste of money, im
pairment of effort, unseemly rivalry,
and the creation of a situation which in
many states it now seems too hopless
to remedy. The University of Califor
nia can only attain pre-eminence if its
parts are whole and not dissipated in
obedience to particularism and local
feeling."
