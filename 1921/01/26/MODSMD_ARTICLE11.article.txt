# ORCHESTRA GIVES SECOND SYMPHONY CONCERT PROGRAM
## Alfred Hertz and Musicians Offer Balanced Program; Glee Club Well Received 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Alfred Hertz and his Symphony
Orchestra, in the second concert of the
season last evening, presented a re
markably well chosen program, which,
with the selections of the Glee Club,
formed an interesting and well-balanced
ensemble of lights and shadows, of deli
cate fancies and brilliant climaxes.
Weber's intriguing "Oberon" overture,
followed by Schubert's Symphony, was
a series of beautiful and melodic move
ments, gradually leading up to the
spirited "Military March," which made
a kind of transition between the two
previous selections and the invigorating
"Songs of the Sea," sung by the Glee
Club, which followed. By way of con
trast again, Alfred Hertz next offered
an interesting group of variations of a
Russian melody, which prepared the way
for the closing number, Wagner's Pre
lude and "Love Death" song from
"Tristan and Isolde."
The effect of the whole was that of
beautifully woven themes and tones
created with the absolute perfection of
which only the symphony is capable.
Each and every number was interpreted
with the care and artistry which is
characteristic of Alfred Hertz. Every
movement was finished and carefully
polished in a way which brought out
the full significance of its meaning,
without destroying the effect of the
symphony.
The fairy horns which opened the
"Oberon" overture were instantly sug
gestive of the magic atmosphere of this
musical version of the "Midsummer
Night's Dream" theme. Played with a
delicat" and airy flow of ingenious
melodies, it was an instant and direct
appeal to the imagination. It reflected
the universally popular story with all
its detailsâ€”fairy choruses, romance and
melody.
Hertz's reading of Schubert's "Un
finished Symphony" was done as only a
lover of Schubert's music who has pene
trated into its spirit could interpret it.
