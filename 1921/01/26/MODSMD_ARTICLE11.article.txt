# ORCHESTRA GIVES SECOND SYMPHONY CONCERT PROGRAM
## Alfred Hertz and Musicians Offer Balanced Program; Glee Club Well Received 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Alfred Hertz and his Symphony
Orchestra, in the second concert of the
season last evening, presented a re
markably well chosen program, which,
with the selections of the Glee Club,
formed an interesting and well-balanced
ensemble of lights and shadows, of deli
cate fancies and brilliant climaxes.
Weber's intriguing "Oberon" overture,
followed by Schubert's Symphony, was
a series of beautiful and melodic move
ments, gradually leading up to the
spirited "Military March," which made
a kind of transition between the two
previous selections and the invigorating
"Songs of the Sea," sung by the Glee
Club, which followed. By way of con
trast again, Alfred Hertz next offered
an interesting group of variations of a
Russian melody, which prepared the way
for the closing number, Wagner's Pre
lude and "Love Death" song from
"Tristan and Isolde."
The effect of the whole was that of
beautifully woven themes and tones
created with the absolute perfection of
which only the symphony is capable.
Each and every number was interpreted
with the care and artistry which is
characteristic of Alfred Hertz. Every
movement was finished and carefully
polished in a way which brought out
the full significance of its meaning,
without destroying the effect of the
symphony.
The fairy horns which opened the
"Oberon" overture were instantly sug
gestive of the magic atmosphere of this
musical version of the "Midsummer
Night's Dream" theme. Played with a
delicat" and airy flow of ingenious
melodies, it was an instant and direct
appeal to the imagination. It reflected
the universally popular story with all
its details—fairy choruses, romance and
melody.
Hertz's reading of Schubert's "Un
finished Symphony" was done as only a
lover of Schubert's music who has pene
trated into its spirit could interpret it.
The orchestration of this number is
beautiful and it was played with deep
understanding. It is filled with ro
mantic and unexpected outbursts, and
the legendary character was maintained
with all the spontaneity and modulation
of melodies which belong to Schubert.
The next number showed the com
poser in a different mood. Instead of
the light and color of the preceding
symphony came the "Military March,"
effective and stirring—a march disguised
in the artistic and brilliant symphony
arrangement which made of it more
than the familiar march theme. Under
Hertz's skillful direction the monoton
ous military character was lost and it
became first an artistic composition and
secondly a march.
The following selection offered by the
orchestra was particularly (interesting
and distinctively different. The theme
was a simple Russian melody with varia
tions arranged by six Russian com
posers, and was not only unique in idea
but was also charming both in its de
gree of variation and in the intrinsic
appeal of the melody.
The orchestra gave a dramatically
accented and appealing presentation of
the Prelude and Liebestad from "Tristan
and Isolde." Wagner in this great
musical drama has created possibilities
which were taken advantage of fully by
Alfred Hertz and his musicians, and
this closing number, full of delicate
touches and heavy climaxes of sound
was one to leave a lasting impression of
the powers of the orchestra.
The Glee Club, singing under the
dirrct'on of Warren D. Allen and ac
rompanicd by the orchestra, won de
cided success in the three songs which
they presented particularly Coleridge-
Taylor's "Viking Song." which hroughi
instant applause. The work of the club
showed finish and gave promising evi
dence of the new policy of the organ
ization regarding the charaeti r of thf
mus'c tVcv are ■■insinir.
