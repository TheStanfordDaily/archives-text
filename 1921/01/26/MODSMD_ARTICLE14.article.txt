# VARSITY DOWNS OREGON AGGIES IN OPENING GAME OF P. C. C. BASKETBALL
## Bert Mills Stars for Stanford, Scoring Sixteen Out of the Thirty-Two Points 
### 
Stanford downed the Oregon Aggies quintet in the first game of the
Pacific Coajjit Conference series in Encina Gymnasium, last night, by a score
of 32 to 19. The game was not as fast as had been anticipated, as both
teams were off color. The northern men showed the effects of the long trip
and the Cardinal team was not playing with its usual Bnap.
It was an interesting game from the standpoint of the spectators as both
teams gave the best they had. Coach Powell's aggregation outweighed the
Aggies and played them off their feet in the last half, both literally and
figuratively. The Aggie players were on the floor in every mixup, and there
were many in this period.

Stanford, as usual, did not get go
ing well until the second half. The
Cardinal tossers drew first blood and
ran the score up to six points before
the Oregonians got started. The Ag
gies slowly got their bearings and
started to creep up on the Cardinal
quintet One half minute before the
gun ending the first half sounded the
score stood 14 to 13 in favor of the
farmers. Just as the timer raised the
gun to end the first part of the game
Bert Mills dropped ona through, put
ting Stanford ahead 15 to 14.
Rogers and Righter started the game
in the forward positions. Davies re
placed Rogers to start the second
period and put new dash into the play
ers. Slowly Stanford forged ahead,
removing all doubts as to who would
win the contest. The Cardinal guards
also got down to their work and kept
the northern men away from the goal.
The Aggies scored but five points in
this half while Stanford totaled seven
teen.
Bert Mills was the largest contri
butor to the Stanford score. He made
half of the points, or sixteen, of
which ten were from fhdrt go«ls aiul
six on free throws.
Richmond made the fanciest shot
of the game. He threw a basket from
the scorer's table which is opposite
the exact center of the court.
Stinson, Aggie forward, scored most
of the points for the visitors. He
made eleven of their nineteen, seven
of which were free throws.
The same two teams will tangle to
night, and the game should be faster.
The Aggies will no doubt play better
ball after a day of rest and both teams
will profit by the experiences gained
in their first encounter.

Stanford downed the Oregon Aggies quintet in the first game of the
Pacific Coajjit Conference series in Encina Gymnasium, last night, by a score
of 32 to 19. The game was not as fast as had been anticipated, as both
teams were off color. The northern men showed the effects of the long trip
and the Cardinal team was not playing with its usual Bnap.
It was an interesting game from the standpoint of the spectators as both
teams gave the best they had. Coach Powell's aggregation outweighed the
Aggies and played them off their feet in the last half, both literally and
figuratively. The Aggie players were on the floor in every mixup, and there
were many in this period.

Stanford, as usual, did not get go
ing well until the second half. The
Cardinal tossers drew first blood and
ran the score up to six points before
the Oregonians got started. The Ag
gies slowly got their bearings and
started to creep up on the Cardinal
quintet One half minute before the
gun ending the first half sounded the
score stood 14 to 13 in favor of the
farmers. Just as the timer raised the
gun to end the first part of the game
Bert Mills dropped ona through, put
ting Stanford ahead 15 to 14.
Rogers and Righter started the game
in the forward positions. Davies re
placed Rogers to start the second
period and put new dash into the play
ers. Slowly Stanford forged ahead,
removing all doubts as to who would
win the contest. The Cardinal guards
also got down to their work and kept
the northern men away from the goal.
The Aggies scored but five points in
this half while Stanford totaled seven
teen.
Bert Mills was the largest contri
butor to the Stanford score. He made
half of the points, or sixteen, of
which ten were from fhdrt go«ls aiul
six on free throws.
Richmond made the fanciest shot
of the game. He threw a basket from
the scorer's table which is opposite
the exact center of the court.
Stinson, Aggie forward, scored most
of the points for the visitors. He
made eleven of their nineteen, seven
of which were free throws.
The same two teams will tangle to
night, and the game should be faster.
The Aggies will no doubt play better
ball after a day of rest and both teams
will profit by the experiences gained
in their first encounter.
