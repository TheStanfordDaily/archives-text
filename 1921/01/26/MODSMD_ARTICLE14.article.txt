# VARSITY DOWNS OREGON AGGIES IN OPENING GAME OF P. C. C. BASKETBALL
## Bert Mills Stars for Stanford, Scoring Sixteen Out of the Thirty-Two Points 
### 
Stanford downed the Oregon Aggies quintet in the first game of the
Pacific Coajjit Conference series in Encina Gymnasium, last night, by a score
of 32 to 19. The game was not as fast as had been anticipated, as both
teams were off color. The northern men showed the effects of the long trip
and the Cardinal team was not playing with its usual Bnap.
It was an interesting game from the standpoint of the spectators as both
teams gave the best they had. Coach Powell's aggregation outweighed the

farmers. Just as the timer raised the
gun to end the first part of the game
Bert Mills dropped ona through, put
ting Stanford ahead 15 to 14.
Rogers and Righter started the game

placed Rogers to start the second
period and put new dash into the play
ers. Slowly Stanford forged ahead,
removing all doubts as to who would
win the contest. The Cardinal guards
also got down to their work and kept
the northern men away from the goal.
The Aggies scored but five points in
this half while Stanford totaled seven
teen.
Bert Mills was the largest contri

half of the points, or sixteen, of
which ten were from fhdrt goÂ«ls aiul
six on free throws.
Richmond made the fanciest shot
of the game. He threw a basket from
the scorer's table which is opposite
the exact center of the court.
Stinson, Aggie forward, scored most
of the points for the visitors. He
