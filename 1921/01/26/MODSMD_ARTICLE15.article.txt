# FURTHER TRYOUTS FOR ENGLISH CLUB PLAY TOMORROW
## 
### 
Further tryouts l'or the English
Club's play, "The Yellow Jacket," to
be produced sometime in March, will
be held tonight from 8 to 10 o'clock
in the Little Theatre, and tomorrow
afternoon from 3 to 5 o'clock, and at
night from 7 to 9 o'clock, in the Little
Theatre. Due to the large number on
the cast several tryouts have to be
held.
The English Club chose for its play
this year one of the most amusing
novelty dramas of the season. "The
Yellow Jacket," a Japanese play
staged with Japanese conventions, is
endorsed by the most renouned critics
of modern dramitics. This year's
play is as wide contrast with the pro
duction last season. While "Ruther
ford and Son" was a heavy and deep
drama, "The Yellow Jacket" is a
lighter and more artistic production.
The date for staging the play has
not yet been set, but it will most
likely be produced around March 9
or 10.
More good parts are still open, and
those who have not yet tried out are
urged to see Coach Gordon Davis at
the times designated above. . The play
in itself affords a good opportuntiy
for any student with the loast bit of
dramatic ability.
