# CARDINAL FIVE PLAYS O.A.C. AGAIN TONIGHT
## Stanford Will Fight to Hold Lead in Conference; Aggies Determined to Win Tonight 
### 
Tonight at 8:00 o'clock, the Oregon
Agricultural five and Coach Powell's
quintet will mix in the second game
of the Pacific Coast Conference Cham
pionship Series. The Aggies were
unable to cope with the Cardinal var
sity in last night's contest, but the
second game should be faster and
more closely contested.
The northerners showed the effects
of their long journey and appeared
travel-worn. They seemed unable to
stand the pace. After a good day's
rest they should show up in their true
form. They showed flashes of being
a mighty clever aggregation last
night and in the opening half they
had Powell's men puzzled with their
perfection of the five-man defense
system. Both teams were plainly
nervous at the opening of the Con
ference schedule.
Coach Powell will probably use the
same line-up that started the con
test last night. "Swede" Righter,
Davies, and Rogers will play the for
ward positions, and Bert Mills will
hold forth at center. Captain Freddy
Adams will play at standing guard
with Dick Dichmond in the running
guard position.
It is expected that the Aggie line-up
will be the fame. Stinson, their larg
est point-winner is regarded as one
of the stars of the northwestern
basketball firmament, and he showed
flashes of his ability last night.
Arthurs, his running mate, is also a
dangerous man with the leather pel
let. Sanders plays in the center of
the court, with Ross* at running guard
and Hubbard in the standing guard po
sition.
Tlio game tonight will to preceded
by a preliminary game be tween the
freshman nve and the I Diversity
High f**.Uool team of Lerkeley. This
content is scheduled to s'p.ri prompt
ly at 7 o'clock, so the Varsity game
should begin at 8 or a little after.
The admission to tonight's contests
will be twenty-five cents to holders
of student body cards and season tick
ets, while outsiders will be charged
seventy-five cents.
