# JANUARY PICTORIAL WILL GO ON SALE TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
The January issue of the Pictorial
will be placed on sale tomorrow. The
editorials and articles indicate that this
issue will fullfil all of the Pictorial's
claims of being "The Students' Maga
zine of Opinion." The editor presents
his views on the recent protest of the
Los Angeles alumni against the admin
istration's policy in money matters, and
expresses the opinion that the way to
help Stanford to obtain the suggested
"red-blooded men" is not by destructive
measures or criticism.
"The Cardinal is Waving," a section
of the magazine, which will appear for
the first time in this issue, deals with
those alumni who have accomplished
things of interest to Stanford people.

'06, William li. Harrelson, '95, Henry
Suzzallo, '99, and Arthur M. Free, '03. in
this section.
Marion Kyle, '18, is the author of an
article "Will Stanford Become a Rich
Man's Institution?" President Wilbur
was interviewed by Kyle on this ques
tion, and the substance of the interview,
as well as statistics on how the high
tuition condition was handled at other
universities, is embodied in the story.
An architect's sketch of the new
LTnion Building is printed in connection
with a story by S. N. Pierce, '22, on the
"New Era of Expansion"; the rugby
team which went up to British Coltirn
bia; some action pictures of the minor
sports, and the usual pictorial supple
ment arc some of the cuts which will
appear.
Ed. R. Martin has an article on the
