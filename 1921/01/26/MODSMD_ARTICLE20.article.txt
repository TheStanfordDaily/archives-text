When Stanford University was founded it was one of the few
American universities located in the country and away from a city of
any size. The previous practice had been for educational institutions to
be built where the center of population was, but since the foundation of
Stanford, several institutions have either moved their plant to the coun
try or rebuilt entirely. The latest project of this nature is under way in
Texas, where there is considerable agitation to move the entire univer
sity to a 500-acre tract of land on the Colorado River, which was willed
to the university.
In case of the University of Texas, the university authorities have
found that they are prevented from expanding in the way of erecting
new buildings, or locating the entire university on a common campus
by the fact that the institution is located in the city, and additional land
cannot readily be purchased. The majority of American universities
located in cities have been confronted with the same problem, and they
have been forced to erect their buildings at various places in the city.
This practice destroys the unity of the institution and prevents to a large
extent the existence of- any amount of "college spirit." College spirit
has been recognized as a needed essential to a live university, and it has
been found to exist best in those institutions that are located in a cen
tral area, and in the country. A recent editorial in an alumni publica
tion of one of the Eastern universities cited Stanford as one of the three
best examples where real "college spirit" existed, and assigned as the
reason that the three universities were located in the country, where the
students developed a strong interest in university affairs and were
bound together because of constant association with each other.
Stanford students probably do not stop as a rule to think of the nat
ural advantages that they have, and perhaps do not realize that Stanford
is perhaps better situated than any other University in the country, all
of which is due to the foresight of the founders, Senator and Mrs.
Stanford.
