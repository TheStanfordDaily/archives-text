### 
A graduate of Stanford and one of

ment is perhaps best known to the

position as head of the Scholarship
Committee.
Professor Whittier was born in St.
Louis. He finished his elementary
education in the Riverside High
School and entered Stanford in the
first year of the University's exist
ence. During his college career Pro
fessor Whittier was actively engaged
in student affairs. He was one of the
board of directors of the Daily Palo
Alto and business manager and later
editor of the Sequoia, the student
magazine which has now been re
placed by the Cardinal.
He received his A.B. degree in 1893
and went to Harvard to study law.
He was granted an LL.B (cum laude)
from that institution in 1896.
While waiting for his degree from
Harvard Professor Whittier practiced
law in Los Angeles for a year. He
was president of the Stanford Alumni
Association in 1897, and in the same
year returned to the University as an
instructor in the Law department. He
was made an assistant professor in
1899 and associate professor in 1900
and served on the Scholarship Com
mittee during that time.
In 1902 Professor Whittier accepted
a position as professor of law on the

initial faculty of the University of
Chicago. At this institution he was
especially occupied with work on
pleading cases and devised a simpli
fied method of pleading which was
adopted by the Municipal court of
Chicpgo. While engaged in this work
Professor Whittier prepared a volume
of "Cases on Common Law Pleading"
which is in use in several law schools
at the present time.
Professor Whittier returned to
Stanford in 1915 to take up his pres
ent position as professor of law and
later became head of the Scholarship
Committee.
During the war the Law department
maintained a legal clinic for the bene
fit of the soldiers stationed at Camp
Fremont, of which Professor Whittier
was the head. It was the duty of this
clinic to handle any legal dealings the
soldiers might have and to give them
advice on such matters.
At the present Professor Whittier is
working up material for a course on
the administration of justice. Such
a course will consist of discussions
of proposed reforms in procedure. It
is intended primarily for graduates
who will have need of such knowledge
when they go into the actual practice
of law.
Besides the "Cases on Common Law
Pleading" Professor Whittier has
written a number of articles for law
magazines and 4s a member of the
American Bar Association.

education in the Riverside High
School and entered Stanford in the
first year of the University's exist
ence. During his college career Pro
fessor Whittier was actively engaged
in student affairs. He was one of the
board of directors of the Daily Palo
Alto and business manager and later
editor of the Sequoia, the student
magazine which has now been re
placed by the Cardinal.
He received his A.B. degree in 1893
and went to Harvard to study law.
He was granted an LL.B (cum laude)
from that institution in 1896.
While waiting for his degree from
Harvard Professor Whittier practiced
law in Los Angeles for a year. He
was president of the Stanford Alumni
Association in 1897, and in the same
year returned to the University as an
instructor in the Law department. He
was made an assistant professor in
1899 and associate professor in 1900
and served on the Scholarship Com
mittee during that time.
In 1902 Professor Whittier accepted
a position as professor of law on the

initial faculty of the University of
Chicago. At this institution he was
especially occupied with work on
pleading cases and devised a simpli
fied method of pleading which was
adopted by the Municipal court of
Chicpgo. While engaged in this work
Professor Whittier prepared a volume
of "Cases on Common Law Pleading"
which is in use in several law schools
at the present time.
Professor Whittier returned to
Stanford in 1915 to take up his pres
ent position as professor of law and
later became head of the Scholarship
Committee.
During the war the Law department
maintained a legal clinic for the bene
fit of the soldiers stationed at Camp
Fremont, of which Professor Whittier
was the head. It was the duty of this
clinic to handle any legal dealings the
soldiers might have and to give them
advice on such matters.
At the present Professor Whittier is
working up material for a course on
the administration of justice. Such
a course will consist of discussions
of proposed reforms in procedure. It
is intended primarily for graduates
who will have need of such knowledge
when they go into the actual practice
of law.
Besides the "Cases on Common Law
Pleading" Professor Whittier has
written a number of articles for law
magazines and 4s a member of the
American Bar Association.
