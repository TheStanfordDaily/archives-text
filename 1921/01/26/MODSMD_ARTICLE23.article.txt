# CABBAGES AND THINGS

Now that Chappie has cracked an
other one on the co-eds, it becomes
our gallant duty to come to the bat
for them.
* * *
Absolutely, we're going to bat for
them, even if we get three round ones
and there's nothing to fan out for.

Co-eds are O.K. The only thing
wrong with the '500 system (we have
this on the word of one of the nastiest
crabs we know) is that every ruff
can't have one.
* * *
We suggest more tuition to expand
the University and allow five hundred
more of 'em.
* * *
That idea of taking freshmen pic
tures is a good thing. Now we want
a place for pictures on women's ap
plication blanks.

A co-ed made our heart glad yes
terday. Gave us a date for March 31.
Less of the date-book stuff would go
better we think. On second thought,
she called it off because of previous
engagement.

Note:—The above was supplied ye
ed. by an energetic contributor who
won't divulge his name for fear some
one will find out about that March 31
date.

It is now incumbent upon us to de
vote a portion of ye colyum to the up
lift movement.' Our goal—be like the
elevator boys.
* * *
One of the first things we did want
to uplift was the boat-house. Now
let's lift the ban on work and fix it up.

That string of campus busses ever
on the go between Pally and this end
ought to be sprinkled with a few
owners interested in such a move
ment.
« t *
We saw a whole movie audience
nuch interested in the movement the
other day. The curtain got stuck.
* m m
That guy who sits next to us in a
history course might apply the sug
gestion to his feet during class hours.
We'vj stood on our own for numerous
years and can still hold the job.

NO MORE LYNCHING — LET'S
HANG THEIR PICTURES.
