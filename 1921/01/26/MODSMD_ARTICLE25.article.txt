# MURPHY WANTS TIME TO HARDEN BOXERS
## California and Stanford Fail To Reach Agreement on the Date For Tournament 
### 
Coach Murphy's boxers will meet the
California team on March 11 at Berke
ley if a final agreement can be reached.
The Blue and Gold coach proposed
February 25, but Murphy wants more
time,to harden his men, and unless the
later date is agreed upon the meet will
be postponed until next quarter.
The Cardinal team will meet U. S. C.
during the spring vacation at the Ath
letic Club in Los Angeles.
There are a number of last year's men
in line for places in the different
weights, and with some promising new
material Murphy expects to turn out a
strong team.
Harley Carter, '24, who played tackle
on the freshman football squad last fall,
is the most promising man in the heavy
weight class. Reports from U. C. say
that "Jimmy" Cline, who stopped Mark
Evans last year in the middleweight
match, will enter this year's meet as a
heavyweight. Cline is conceded to be the
best man on the Bruin Hjm.
"Babe" Henry, winner of the middle
weight championship against California
two years ago, will work in the light
heavy class this year. In the middle
weight Mark Evans, '21, another veteran
of the ring, is conceded a place on the
team.
Three men in line for the jwelter
weight match are Walter Bills, '21,
"Bill" Burkhard, '23, and Johnny Lane,
'23. They are all fast men in the ring
and it is a toss-up between them at
present.
"Jimmy" Ross, '23, and "Bob" Speirs,
'22, are pitted against each other for the
lightweight. Ross works low and has a
guard which makes him a hard man to
hit. His wallop is strong enough to
make his offensive work dangerous.
Speirs worked in this class on last
year's team and will give Ross a run
for his money.
"Mike" Hodges, '22, who defeated his
opponent in the bantamweight against
U. S. C. last year, will fight in the
featherweight this year, and has a com
bination of form and aggressiveness
which make him one of the best men on
the team.
So far Samuel Simmons, '23, a new
man in the game, has the field to him
self among the bantams. He has won
three bouts in the preliminary tourna
ments and is going strong.
There are several strong competitors
in all of the weights and no one is sure
of a place yet. Coach Murhpy is putting
them through preliminary bouts and the
winners of these will be among the men
to place on the team against the Bruins
and the Trojans.
