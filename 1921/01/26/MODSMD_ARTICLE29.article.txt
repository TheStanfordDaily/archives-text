# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM TO PLAY ITALIAN CLUB SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Nearing the end of their long lea'gue
schedule, Coach Harry Maloney's soc
cerites are leaving nothing undone
that will insure a successful close to
a season that has so far been a brilli
ant on 3 t r Stanford. Undefeated as
yet, it is the logical thing to forecast
that they will end the season with the
same standing.
Two more games remain on the
schedule to be won before Stanford
can claim the soccer championship.
The game next Saturday is with the
Italian Club of San Francisco, and the
following week-end the closing game
will be played with the Chinese Y.
M. C. A. Although neither team is
one to be despised, Stanford should
win if it plays anything like the brand
of soccer it has shown in crucial
games this season.
Practice has been held twice a
week, and the men are getting back
into their best form. The hard-fought
game with the Olympics necessitated
some time for recovery, as the brilli
ant playing exhibited on that occasion
was enough to take the edge off of
any squad. Coach Maloney is confi
dent that by the end of this week the
team will be in fine shape and ready
to show the Italians an unbeatable
brand of soccer.
All the members of the team are in
good physical condition and are free
from injuries that would hamper the
work. Stanford has been fortunate
so far this season in the absence of
injuries or sickness that might break
up the combination work of the ma
chine. Nevertheless, it has been felt
that such occurrences would not mean
disaster because of the substitutes
that have been available throughout
the season.
The preseut weather conditions have
not helped the soccer playing. Wet
weather is a hindrance to any foot
ball game, especially one such as soc
cer, where the teams are moving
about the field all the time. Hopes are
that the clouds will disappear by next
Saturday so that the game will be a
good fast one. Whether a wet field
works to Stanford's disadvantage is
hard to figure, as the opposing teams
do not seem to be any better water
dogs than Maloney's men.
