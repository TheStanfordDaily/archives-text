# FRESHMAN SOCCER TEAM DEFEATS PALO ALTO HIGH, SCORE 2-1
## 
### 
Freshman soccer stock jumped up a
few points yesterday, when the babes
downed the Palo Alto High School
eleven, by a 2 to 1 score. This be
r the fifth game of the series played
with tho high school, the freshmen
now have the lead. They have won
two, tied two and lost one.
The game was in doubt until the
final whistle blew, although at the
end of tho first half tho game seemed
safely on ice for the freshmen. It
narrowly escaped slipping off before
the last period ended. Palo Alto kept
conning stronger and stronger towards
the close of the contest. One clean
shot into the net was followed by a
second which would have tied the
score had it not been disallowed on
account of offside play.
Some changes have taken place in
the '24's line-up since last quarter, but
the team seems to have lost none of
its effectiveness. Captain Todd is
still at tho head of the team. Dwight
Wilbur was installed as new goal
keeper, and did effective work in pre
venting scores. Tho field's slippery
condition prevented the game from
being as clean-cut as would otherwiso
have been possiblo.
