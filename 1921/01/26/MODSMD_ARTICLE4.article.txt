# Last Tub in Encina Is Finally Replaced By Modern Plumbing
## 
### 
The old order changeth. Yea, verily.
The last bathtub has been taken out of
Encina. The old instrument of cleanli
ness, which reposed in state on the third
floor, the terror of freshmen and the
one solace of the old-timer, is no more.
It has given way to the omnipresent
shower. New fixtures have been in
stalled throughout the bathroom, and
the shining tile and nickel gives no
indication that here was made the last
stand of the grand old custom of tub
bing. Kismet!
