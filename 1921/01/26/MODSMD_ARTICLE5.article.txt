# FRESHMAN-UNIVERSITY HIGH GAME IS TONIGHT
## Trans-bay Quintet Reputed to Be Fast and Heavy; Invaders Beat Frosh Last Year 
### 
University High School comes down
tonight to meet the freshman squad in
what promises to be the fastest of the
preliminary season games. The contest
tonight is scheduled for 7 o'clock. The
northern team is one of the two prep
school aggregations that defeated last
year's freshmen, and has practically the
same lineup as they used during the last
season.
The Babes are in good shape for the
contest tonight, having rested for two
days with only light practice. They are
working now as a unit instead of the
more 1 or less ragged play that has
marked most of the earlier games.
Granger, playing at forward, has con
quered the tendency to pass constantly
to McHose for the shooting of the bas
kets, and his performance in the last
game against Commerce High School pf
San Francisco showed him to have the
ability to make the goals. He is one of
the best men on the team when it comes
to advancing the ball, and is compara
tively heavy alongside of the rest of the
quintet.
Jansen, center, is fast gaining the
condition the lack of which has slightly
troubled him in the past matches, and
his fast offensive and long arms 011
guarding will make him the most dan
gerous man on the team. Bob Atvvill
has showed up well at guard lately and
is making a hard fight to cinch the place
before the main battle with the Bruin
Cubs. Nip McHose is playing con
sistently at his front line position and is
only handicapped at the present by his
lack of weight. Smith, who has held
down the standing guard position from
the beginning of the season, is holding
out well on the job. His work on the
defense under the basket has brought
down considerable praise for him in
the games that have come so far.
