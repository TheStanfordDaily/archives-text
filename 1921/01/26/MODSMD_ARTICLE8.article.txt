# ORGANIZED WOMEN ADOPT AMENDMENT TO CONSTITUTION
## Dean Bradford Urges Support Of Intramural Athletics; Games Will Be Open to All 
### 
Election of women's officials will pro
ceed on an entirely new plan from now
on, according to the amendment to the
constitution of the Organized Women
of Stanford University adopted at a
mass meeting of the women held in the
Little Theater yesterday afternoon. As
the section formerly stood, Council
members were nominated entirely by the
members of Conference, and were then
elected on the Quad. It was felt that
this system had in it possibilities of too
much group interest, not enough repre
sentation of opinion of all the women,
and was too cumbersome for the Con
ference. The new amendment, which
was drawn up by a committee composed
of Florence Hocking, chairman; Helene
Searcy, and Ann Hardy, is as follows:
"Article IV. Elections Section 2a.
"Each of the sorority houses on the
campus may nominate eight women. Not
more than three of this number may
be members of the sorority making the
nominations; four of the number shall
be seniors and four shall be juniors.
"Roble Club may nominate fifteen
women. Not more than six may be
members of Roble Club. Eight shall be
seniors and seven shall be juniors.
"These names shall be brought to Con
ference by the Conference member in
the first week of April. They shall then
be put in the hands of a nominating
committee of five members to be ap
pointed by the president, who shall con
fer with them, but may not vote.
"The nominating committee shall se
lect twenty names from the list handed
then, ten to be seniors and ten to be
juniors. The nominations of this com
mittee shall then be submitted to Con
ference in the week preceding the elec
tion. The Conference shall then proceed
by secret ballot to vote for four seniors
and four juniors until, by the elimina
tion process, eight have been nominated.
The two junior members of the present
Council automatically become nominees,
making a total of ten nominees. These
nominations shall be published in The
Daly Palo Alto for two days preceding
the election."
The second part of the meeting was
turned over to Hester Proctor, '21.
president of the Women's Athletic As
sociation, who gave a brief appeal for
more support of athletics, and an
nounced that contests will be open to
men as well as women. The present
system of intramural athletics, with
occasional intercollegiate intraclass
games, was vigorously upheld by Dean
Harriet Bradford, who said that this
is the best system to develop an all
round interest in athletics. There are
plenty of women out for athletics, but
not enough out on the side lines to sup
port the teams, she said.
Miss Lois Kendall sophomore coach,
spoke briefly, urging the women to come
out for basketball. She announced the
Mills game as being scheduled for
March 4, with a probable game on Feb
ruary 6.
The Vocational Conference for this
year was announced for Saturday tnorn
mg, February 19, and women were in
vited to attend a current events dis
cission group to be led by Professor
Greene on Tuesday at 5 p. m.
Dorothy Marston, '22, was elected
women's yell leader. This is an entirely
new departure in women's activities, but
one which it is expected will assume
larger proportions as it is developed.

March 4, with a probable game on Feb
ruary 6.
The Vocational Conference for this
year was announced for Saturday tnorn
mg, February 19, and women were in
vited to attend a current events dis
cission group to be led by Professor
Greene on Tuesday at 5 p. m.
Dorothy Marston, '22, was elected
women's yell leader. This is an entirely
new departure in women's activities, but
one which it is expected will assume
larger proportions as it is developed.
Election of women's officials will pro
ceed on an entirely new plan from now
on, according to the amendment to the
constitution of the Organized Women
of Stanford University adopted at a
mass meeting of the women held in the
Little Theater yesterday afternoon. As
the section formerly stood, Council
members were nominated entirely by the
members of Conference, and were then
elected on the Quad. It was felt that
this system had in it possibilities of too
much group interest, not enough repre
sentation of opinion of all the women,
and was too cumbersome for the Con
ference. The new amendment, which
was drawn up by a committee composed
of Florence Hocking, chairman; Helene
Searcy, and Ann Hardy, is as follows:
"Article IV. Elections Section 2a.
"Each of the sorority houses on the
campus may nominate eight women. Not
more than three of this number may
be members of the sorority making the
nominations; four of the number shall
be seniors and four shall be juniors.
"Roble Club may nominate fifteen
women. Not more than six may be
members of Roble Club. Eight shall be
seniors and seven shall be juniors.
"These names shall be brought to Con
ference by the Conference member in
the first week of April. They shall then
be put in the hands of a nominating
committee of five members to be ap
pointed by the president, who shall con
fer with them, but may not vote.
"The nominating committee shall se
lect twenty names from the list handed
then, ten to be seniors and ten to be
juniors. The nominations of this com
mittee shall then be submitted to Con
ference in the week preceding the elec
tion. The Conference shall then proceed
by secret ballot to vote for four seniors
and four juniors until, by the elimina
tion process, eight have been nominated.
The two junior members of the present
Council automatically become nominees,
making a total of ten nominees. These
nominations shall be published in The
Daly Palo Alto for two days preceding
the election."
The second part of the meeting was
turned over to Hester Proctor, '21.
president of the Women's Athletic As
sociation, who gave a brief appeal for
more support of athletics, and an
nounced that contests will be open to
men as well as women. The present
system of intramural athletics, with
occasional intercollegiate intraclass
games, was vigorously upheld by Dean
Harriet Bradford, who said that this
is the best system to develop an all
round interest in athletics. There are
plenty of women out for athletics, but
not enough out on the side lines to sup
port the teams, she said.
Miss Lois Kendall sophomore coach,
spoke briefly, urging the women to come
out for basketball. She announced the
Mills game as being scheduled for
March 4, with a probable game on Feb
ruary 6.
