# JOURNALISTS TO HEAR PUBLICITY SPEAKER TONIGHT
## C. E. Persons, San Francisco Man, Will Address Stanford Association at Lecture 
### 
The work of the publicity man,
which forms the subject of Mr. C. E.
Persons' talk at the Journalists'
Association meeting tonight, is arous
ing intense intetrest among news
paper men and businfess men. It has
expanded so rapidly, particularly since
the beginning of the war and employs
such large numbers that several
schools of journalism have instituted
and are planning to institute special
courses of training for it; although
when the idea was broached a year
ago at the national conference of the
college teachers of journalism by Pro
fessor Everett W. Smith, of Stanford,
it aroused vigorous opposition on the
part of a considerable number of
those present.
Professor Smith's argument, which
Mr. Persons agrees, was that the pub
licity man is firmly established,
whether the newspapers like it or not,
and that he ought, therefore, be well
trained for his job and do his work
in a straightforward and self-respect
ing manner.
Many newspapers still oppose the
publicity man partly because publicity
work is attracting so many of the
best newspaper reporters of the coun
try and offers a higher pay, and part
ly because the newspaper editors ob
ject to what they regard as the ef
forts of the publicity men to get "free
advertising," for their employers and
to suppress undesirable news.
Mr. Persons believes that the pub
licity man can perform a worthy
function through being a trained ex
pert engaged in offering the public
the information which he ought to
have concerning the organizations
which employ him, and in tonight's
talk will discuss some of the ethical
problems which confront the publicity
man in his work. Mr. Persons is
better qualified to discuss this sub
ject since he has had first-hand ex
perience in business, in straight news
paper work, in publicity work, and in
advertising, all of which are directly
concerned with the activities and
problems of the publicity man.
The American Journalists' Associa
tion invites all Stanford people who
may be interested in this subject,
whether as prospective business men,
journalists, or publicity men, to at
tend the informal dinner at which Mr.
Persons will speak. It will be held
in the Alpha Sigma Phi house, at 6:15
o'clock this evening and the charge
is 50c.
