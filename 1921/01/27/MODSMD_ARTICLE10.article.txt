UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Jan. 27.â€”Strong opposition to the re
moval of the agricultural department
and erecting it into a separate "college
was voiced by President Barrows in
his annual report presented Governor
Stephens yesterday. Such a change
would result in a waste of money and
unseemly rivalry, he declared.
Speaking of the proposals for elim
inating lower division work in the Uni
versity, he asserted that student self
government would he destroyed, all stu
dent activities impaired and our ath
letic superiority threatened hy beginning
attendance with the junior year. That
student behavior was never better than
it is at the present time was the asser
tion made bv the President.
