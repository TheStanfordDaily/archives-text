# Officials Put Legion Soccerites In League
## 
### 
New interest in soccer has been
aroused by the formation of the Amer
ican Legion team of the Palo Alto
post, which contains many former
Stanford stars. The team was hurri
edly organized about a week ago to
meet the varsity soccer team in a
league schedule when the Columbia
Club dropped out, and such a good
showing was made that at a meeting
of the soccer officials in San Fran
cisco, Tuesday, it was decided to place
the Legion soecerites in the regular
league schedule. This schedule is
being drawn up and will bo an
nounced later.
Coach Maloney, being also com
mander of the post, has the formation
of the team under his supervision,
and will no doubt be able to turn out
a strong team capable of giving the
other league teams a good fight during
the remainder of the schedulo.
The next game hero will be played
Saturday when the Legion team mixes
with the freshmen in a workout.
Former Stanford players will be on
the former team, among them Lieu
tenant Boyle, who was once captain of
the Stanford soccer varsity, and
Robert Ames, former rugby star.
