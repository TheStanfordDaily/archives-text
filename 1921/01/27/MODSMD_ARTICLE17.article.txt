# CARDINAL MAINTAINS LEAD IN CONFERENCE BY AGAIN DEFEATING AGGIES, 33-25
## BERT MILLS MAKES TWENTY-THREE POINTS OF STANFORD'S TOTAL SCORE; STINSON STARS FOR OREGON FIVE 
### 
Stanford now has an unblemished record in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence by virtue of a second defeat administered to tho Oregon Agricultural
basketball five last night in Enclna Gymnasium. Both teams put out some
flashy basketball, but Coach Powell s men snowed their opponents under
in the last half, and copped the game 33 to 25.
The first half was almost even up. Stanford scored one more point
than the northerners, leading 12 to 11 at half time. The visitors played a
natty defensive game during this period and three wicked tosses by Arth
urs, the Aggie captain, featured their play on the offensive. Stanford, as
usual, failed to open up, confining its efforts mainly to defense.

The second period started with a
bang. Mills and Righter cracked
things wide open with fancy shots
from the field. The Aggies were forced
to take the defense as the Cardinal
quintet kept the ball in their terri
tory. Time after time Bert Mills
emerged from a tangle under the op
position goal and dropped the ball
through. Stanford scored twenty-one
points while the Oregonians were
making fourteen. Of the twetoty-one
made by Stanford twenty were pure
field goals while one was on a free
toss. Eight of the fourteen made
by the Aggies came from Stanford
fouls which they converted.
Bert Mills was easily the star of
the game. In the gamo of the pre
ceding night the fighting center made
one-half of the Stanford total. Last
night he surpassed this performance
and made one more point than two
thirds of the total, scoring 23 points.
Eighteen were tallied from field goals
and five from free throws.
Stinson scored thirteen points for
the farmers. He converted eleven out
of twelve free throws and added one
basket for good measure.
A peculiar and unusual play was
pulled off last night. Itigbtei* receiv
ed the ball near the Stanford goal
but found he was in no position to
shoot so he passed to Mills .who was
also well covered. Bert stuck up his
fingers so that the course of the ball
was deflected into the basket. Mills
received credit for the goal but has
