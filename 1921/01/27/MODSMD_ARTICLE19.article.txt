# HARVARD UNIVERSITY TO INCREASE TUITION TO MEET CONDITIONS
## 
### 
President Lowell of Harvard has re
cently made his annual report to the
overseers of the university, in which he
states that in spite of the generous en
dowment fund just contributed, there
is a staggering deficit in the resources
of the institution. Although the salary
of the teaching force has been raised to
approximately 50 per cent above the
former salary, an absolute necessity, the
endowment does not cover the increase
in wages of labor, the cost of services
of all kinds, and the recent great in
crease in the pricc of fuel and other ma
terials. The deficit which Harvard now
faces amounts to $161,0 CX), with a cer
tainty that this will be doubled for the
current year. Since it is impossible to
increase the endowment fund at present,
the only resource left is to make an
increase in tuition fees.
It is interesting for Stanford people
to note that President Lowell was in
fluenced, in part, by the fact that other
institutions have taken like action in
the raising of needed funds. Harvard is
charging distinctly less than many other
universities of its size and importance at
the present time. It is unwillingly that
the president predicts an increase "ad
justed to the diminution in the value of
the dollar."
