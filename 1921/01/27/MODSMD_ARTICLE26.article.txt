# AN AGREEMENT DESIRED
## 
### 
The case against the grocers in Palo Alto will he brought before an
arbitration committee tonight in an attempt to reach solfle kind o£ a
settlement. Since the publication of the price chart in The Daily Palo
Alto last Tuesday, which showed an apparent higher level of grocery
prices existing in Palo Alto than in Redwood City, San Jose, and San
Francisco, considerable agitation has arisen both on the Stanford cam
pus and in the city of; Palo Alto over the condition alleged to exist.
House managers of fraternities, sororities, and eating clubs havt
joined whole-heartedly in the movement with the determination to dis
cover the reason for the price differences. They desire to buy their
groceries in Palo Alto and to patronize the local merchants entirely if
they will be given prices corresponding to those quoted in surrounding
towns. Merchants in these neighboring towns have expressed a desire
to secure the campus trade, but the Stanford organizations should buy m
Palo Alto and desire to-do so if the grocers will meet them with a lower
level of prices.
At one time a number of the Stanford fraternities and sororities
were more or less in debt to the grocers, and they paid their accounts
slowly. This is not the case now. Largely through the efforts of Presi
dent Wilbur the fraternities and sororities arc now all in excellent shape
financially, and with one or two minor exceptions their credit is r.ated as
guod by the Merchants' Association in Palo Alto, and those houses that
are slightly in debt are not considered bad accounts. Since the apparent
cause for charging an increase over the regular prices has been removed,
the campus organizations are entitled to receive the benefits therefrom,
and they are not willing to accept prices higher than those in neighbor
ing towns by 6 or 7 per cent.
The campus organizations will meet the grocers fairly on any prop
osition suggested that will lower prices. However, the house man
agers feel that they have a just case, and they will insist 011 some sort of
a satisfactory agreement.
