# R. M. ALDEN IS ENGLISH CRITIC AND EDUCATOR
## 
### 
For nearly twenty years Raymond
Mac Donald Alden has been associated
with the Stanford English Department.
Coming to Stanford in 1901, a young
man but lately out of college, he has
devoted the years since to the duties of
his professorial chair and to research in
English. Service as head of the English
Department of the University of Illinois
from 1911 to 1914 has been the only
break in the continuity of his Stanford
work.
Back of the phrase "associated with
the English Department" is concealed
k work which is truly appreciated only
by students of his classes ahd associates
on the faculty. It has not been a sensa
tional work that occasionally breaks into
newspaper headlines because of radical
views on current literature. It has been
a loyal service of two decades to Stan
ford as a critical English scholar and
author. The testimonial of his en
deavors is best contained in the mem
ories of the scores of Stanford grad
uates who remember Dr. Alden as an
interpreter of literature and critic of
student composition.
The son of Isabelle Mac Donald
Alden, one of the most widely read of
religious novelists of the past genera
tion, he naturally specialized in classical
and English study during his university
days. An A. B. degree from the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania in 1894 was
lowed by a Masters from Harvard,
while his Alma Mater granted him a
degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1898.
It was only shortly afterwards that
Stanford called him to a chair of assist
ant professor of English. Four years of
teaching, one at Harvard and three at
the University of Pennsylvania, pre
ceded his Stanford appointment in 19111.
Holding several chairs during the fol
lowing years, he is now, as a professor
of English, the acting head of the de
partment.
The volumes published under his
name have been of varied nature. Until
recent years he was a frequent contrib
utor of short stories to the national
magazines. Collier's Weekly in 1905
awarcd him a $1,000 prize in a national
short story writing contest. A volume
of children's stories, containing "Why
the Chimes Rang," today retains a wide
circulation, although it was published
over ten years ago.
The research student in English best
knows Professor Alden for his text
books and particularly for his critical
works on poetry. His "Variorium F.di

tion of Shakespeare's Sonnets" is the
standard text of the sonnets by the hard
from Stratford-on-the-Avon. A volume
now in press, "Master Spirits of Litera
ture," contains a review by Dr. Alden
on Shakespearean drama. Two texts,
"English Verse" and "Introduction to
Poetry," are used by many schools.
A curious student of the records of
Stanford graduates, from 1904 to 1910,
who are now successfully practicing
law, would find on investigation that a
large number received their training in
public speaking from Professor Alden.
The period was unusually successful for
Stanford in intercollegiate debating. The
two Sheldon brothers each won the
Carnot medal, as the Joffre medal was
then named. Frank Hill, Morgan, Mil
ler, and Badkin were other debaters who
were successfully trained by him.
A choice of favorite authors, espe
cially contemporary writers, is difficult,
in the opinion of Dr. Alden. If any
favoritism is to be displayed, he admits
that the books of Arnold Bennett, Hugh
Walpole, and Owen Wister are more
often found on his library table than
those of any other contemporary
authors. It is the Victoran novelists to
whom he turns when he wishes to study
the best type of novel writing, for, he
believes, the novelists of that period are
today underestimated. The Atlantic
Monthly, Yale Review, and Literary
Digest are his choices from among the
current periodicals.
Mountain tramping and occasionally
tennis arc his athletic diversions. The
ideal vacation, he believes, is to combine
a motoring and hiking trip. He finds a
never-failing relaxation in music as a
piano and pipe-organ player.

Walpole, and Owen Wister are more
often found on his library table than

authors. It is the Victoran novelists to
whom he turns when he wishes to study
the best type of novel writing, for, he
believes, the novelists of that period are
today underestimated. The Atlantic
Monthly, Yale Review, and Literary

current periodicals.
Mountain tramping and occasionally

For nearly twenty years Raymond
Mac Donald Alden has been associated
with the Stanford English Department.
Coming to Stanford in 1901, a young
man but lately out of college, he has
devoted the years since to the duties of
his professorial chair and to research in
English. Service as head of the English
Department of the University of Illinois
from 1911 to 1914 has been the only
break in the continuity of his Stanford
work.
Back of the phrase "associated with
the English Department" is concealed
k work which is truly appreciated only
by students of his classes ahd associates
on the faculty. It has not been a sensa
tional work that occasionally breaks into
newspaper headlines because of radical
views on current literature. It has been
a loyal service of two decades to Stan
ford as a critical English scholar and
author. The testimonial of his en
deavors is best contained in the mem
ories of the scores of Stanford grad
uates who remember Dr. Alden as an
interpreter of literature and critic of
student composition.
The son of Isabelle Mac Donald
Alden, one of the most widely read of
religious novelists of the past genera
tion, he naturally specialized in classical
and English study during his university
days. An A. B. degree from the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania in 1894 was
lowed by a Masters from Harvard,
while his Alma Mater granted him a
degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1898.
It was only shortly afterwards that
Stanford called him to a chair of assist
ant professor of English. Four years of
teaching, one at Harvard and three at
the University of Pennsylvania, pre
ceded his Stanford appointment in 19111.
Holding several chairs during the fol
lowing years, he is now, as a professor
of English, the acting head of the de
partment.
The volumes published under his
name have been of varied nature. Until
recent years he was a frequent contrib
utor of short stories to the national
magazines. Collier's Weekly in 1905
awarcd him a $1,000 prize in a national
short story writing contest. A volume
of children's stories, containing "Why
the Chimes Rang," today retains a wide
circulation, although it was published
over ten years ago.
The research student in English best
knows Professor Alden for his text
books and particularly for his critical
works on poetry. His "Variorium F.di

tion of Shakespeare's Sonnets" is the
standard text of the sonnets by the hard
from Stratford-on-the-Avon. A volume
now in press, "Master Spirits of Litera
ture," contains a review by Dr. Alden
on Shakespearean drama. Two texts,
"English Verse" and "Introduction to
Poetry," are used by many schools.
A curious student of the records of
Stanford graduates, from 1904 to 1910,
who are now successfully practicing
law, would find on investigation that a
large number received their training in
public speaking from Professor Alden.
The period was unusually successful for
Stanford in intercollegiate debating. The
two Sheldon brothers each won the
Carnot medal, as the Joffre medal was
then named. Frank Hill, Morgan, Mil
ler, and Badkin were other debaters who
were successfully trained by him.
A choice of favorite authors, espe
cially contemporary writers, is difficult,
in the opinion of Dr. Alden. If any
favoritism is to be displayed, he admits
that the books of Arnold Bennett, Hugh
Walpole, and Owen Wister are more
often found on his library table than
those of any other contemporary
authors. It is the Victoran novelists to
whom he turns when he wishes to study
