know a place where a man can get
the unpleasant task finished in less
time than that.

"The Lord helps those who help
themselves, at the Inn, oughtt to be
"Lord help those who help them
selves."

You tell 'em fence, you've been
around a lot.

Wilful Willie is willing to donate
X. Y. Z. the condensed hair tonic.

Even Soupy Sue expresses a desire
to contribute the evaporated tooth
paste to X. Y. Z.

A San Jose chiropractor runs an
ad in the "Evening News," under

And now Fresno is trying to pass
an ordinance prohibiting the owner

A Chicago undertaker recently cele
brated the death of Jack Barleycorn
by putting $10,000 worth of him in
caskets and sundry other similar re
ceptacles. Prohibition agents disin
terred the remains and killed 'em
again. If they had only left 'em they'd
have been killed in the proper manner,
fitting to the occasion and delegated
use.
