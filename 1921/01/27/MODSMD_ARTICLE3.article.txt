# Recital Will Feature Bach's D Minor Sonata
## 
### 
Bach's Sonata in D minor will be
the featured selection in the Organ
Recital given by Warren D. Allen in
the Memorial Church, Thursday after
noon. The Sonata to be given is a
very unique and difficult work. It is
one of the "Trio-Sonatas," so called
because the writing throughout is for
three voices. The three separate
parts are played on the pedals aÂ»d on
two separate manuals. Each melody
is separate, distinct and independent,
so that the effect is that of a piece
of chamber music played by three in
struments, e.g., flute, violin and 'cello.
Other selections which Mr. Allen will
givo are:
Marche Nuptiale Guilmant
Reverie Debussy
Ancient Phoenician Procession
R. S. Stoughton
The recital will bo given as usual
at 4:15 p.m.
