# CALIFORNIA OPENS BASKETBALL SEASON TOMORROW EVENING
## 
### 
California's varsity quintet will open
its conference season tomorrow night
when the Blue and Gold men meet the
Oregon Aggies in Harmon Gymnasium.
Coach Wight's team will have to win
both games if they are to be reckoned
as real factors in the championship race.
The Aggies, after their brace of de
feats here, are going up to Berkeley
determined to break even by taking both
games.
California may yet win the champion
ship of the California-Nevada Basket
ball League, even though the Cards have
won three games. St. Ignatius defeated
Santa Clara 16 to 15 last night, but the
Ignatians were whipped by Berkeley last
week. St. Mary's, whom the Cards
overwhelmed, sprung a surprise and
came out ahead of the Nevada Sagehens,
21 to 19. The Davis Farm boys have
forfeited all of their games owing to
an uncompleted gymnasium.
If Coach Powell's five defeats the
Bruins there will be no contender for
the California-Nevada championship
save the Pacific quintet, which the Cards
have already beaten.
