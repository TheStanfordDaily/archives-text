# ENCINA TEAM DEFEATS MEDICS IN FAST BATTLE
## Hall Team Makes Sensational Come-back After Doctors Have the Game "On Ice" 
### 
Rallying when it looked as if they
were hopelessly beaten, the Encina
East Third quintet staged a sensation
al come-back, and defeated the Medics
15 to 14, yesterday afternoon, on the
court in Encina Gymnasium.
The Medics started off with a rush,
and for the first few minutes it seem
ed that the Hall men would not have
a chance. The Medics were leading
12 to 6 at the end of the first half.
Phimpton started off the second half
with a basket for the Encina team.
Eggleston followed with another. The
Medics essayed a come-back, but
strong defensive work on the part of
tho Encina guards kept them from
scoring. A goal on a penalty and a
basket by Henderson put the Hall
men in the lead. The Medicine men
came back and regained the lead
when Fernish made a clever shot from
mid-field.
Again the Encina team rallied, and
in the last half-minute scored the last
basket of tho game, winning by one
point. Phimpton and Eggleston show
ed up well in the forward positions
for the winners. Lembke, Dierker
and Henderson did some fine work in
the second half.
Coach Powell watched the game and
commented on the playing of several
men. Brown, forward for the Medics,
made a particularly fine showing. His
playing was as fast as has been seen
in the whole series, too fast in fact,
for his team-mates to follow with
out more training. Love, at center,
repeatedly took the ball away from
the Oaks and carried it into his own
territory.
Fernish played a fast game for the
Medics, and Baker came in for his
share of the scoring. Beaver's work
at standing guard was especially ef
fective in the first half.
Yesterday's victory gives the En
cina team the first place in League
Seven, and makes it a contender for
the Intramural championship.

Delta Chis and the Alpha Tau Omegas

comedy as basketball. Anderson,
