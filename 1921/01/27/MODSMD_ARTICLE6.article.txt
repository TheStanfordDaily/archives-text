# ENCINA TEAM DEFEATS MEDICS IN FAST BATTLE
## Hall Team Makes Sensational Come-back After Doctors Have the Game "On Ice" 
### 
Rallying when it looked as if they
were hopelessly beaten, the Encina
East Third quintet staged a sensation
al come-back, and defeated the Medics
15 to 14, yesterday afternoon, on the
court in Encina Gymnasium.
The Medics started off with a rush,
and for the first few minutes it seem
ed that the Hall men would not have
a chance. The Medics were leading
12 to 6 at the end of the first half.
Phimpton started off the second half
with a basket for the Encina team.
Eggleston followed with another. The
Medics essayed a come-back, but
strong defensive work on the part of
tho Encina guards kept them from
scoring. A goal on a penalty and a
basket by Henderson put the Hall
men in the lead. The Medicine men
came back and regained the lead
when Fernish made a clever shot from
mid-field.
Again the Encina team rallied, and
in the last half-minute scored the last
basket of tho game, winning by one
point. Phimpton and Eggleston show
ed up well in the forward positions
for the winners. Lembke, Dierker
and Henderson did some fine work in
the second half.
Coach Powell watched the game and
commented on the playing of several
men. Brown, forward for the Medics,
made a particularly fine showing. His
playing was as fast as has been seen
in the whole series, too fast in fact,
for his team-mates to follow with
out more training. Love, at center,
repeatedly took the ball away from
the Oaks and carried it into his own
territory.
Fernish played a fast game for the
Medics, and Baker came in for his
share of the scoring. Beaver's work
at standing guard was especially ef
fective in the first half.
Yesterday's victory gives the En
cina team the first place in League
Seven, and makes it a contender for
the Intramural championship.
The scrimmage between the Theta
Delta Chis and the Alpha Tau Omegas
set up from Saturday, was as much
comedy as basketball. Anderson,
standing guard for the Thota Delts,
Btarted the but by shooting a goal for
the A. T. O.'s. Lilly contributed to
the entertainmentt by taking a seat
in the bleachers when there was
nothing doing in bis sector.
On the side of real basketball play
ing, Neil entertained with some neat
basket shooting for the winners, and
was chief point winner for hia team.
The Alpha Tau Omegas won 15 to 7,
counting the basket presented to them
to Anderson. *
The Theta Delta Chi lineup was
Lilliy, Boucher, Cecil, Barham and
Anderson.
Phelp3 went in for the A. T. O.'s
when Eels was knocked out by a hard
fall. Neil, Rose, Porter and Taylor
completed the winning squad.
Today teams of League Five fight
their fourth battle. The Sigma Chis
are leading, up to this afternoon's con
testa.
Tomorrow, the Sequoia second and
Theta Xi quintets tangle. Other teams
scheduled for tomorrow are EI Campo
vs. Sequoia First and Fourth, and Chi
Psi vs. Zcta Psi. These games will
mark the fourth round for League
Three.

Rallying when it looked as if they
were hopelessly beaten, the Encina
East Third quintet staged a sensation
al come-back, and defeated the Medics
15 to 14, yesterday afternoon, on the
court in Encina Gymnasium.
The Medics started off with a rush,
and for the first few minutes it seem
ed that the Hall men would not have
a chance. The Medics were leading
12 to 6 at the end of the first half.
Phimpton started off the second half
with a basket for the Encina team.
Eggleston followed with another. The
Medics essayed a come-back, but
strong defensive work on the part of
tho Encina guards kept them from
scoring. A goal on a penalty and a
basket by Henderson put the Hall
men in the lead. The Medicine men
came back and regained the lead
when Fernish made a clever shot from
mid-field.
Again the Encina team rallied, and
in the last half-minute scored the last
basket of tho game, winning by one
point. Phimpton and Eggleston show
ed up well in the forward positions
for the winners. Lembke, Dierker
and Henderson did some fine work in
the second half.
Coach Powell watched the game and
commented on the playing of several
men. Brown, forward for the Medics,
made a particularly fine showing. His
playing was as fast as has been seen
in the whole series, too fast in fact,
for his team-mates to follow with
out more training. Love, at center,
repeatedly took the ball away from
the Oaks and carried it into his own
territory.
Fernish played a fast game for the
Medics, and Baker came in for his
share of the scoring. Beaver's work
at standing guard was especially ef
fective in the first half.
Yesterday's victory gives the En
cina team the first place in League
Seven, and makes it a contender for
the Intramural championship.
The scrimmage between the Theta
Delta Chis and the Alpha Tau Omegas
set up from Saturday, was as much
comedy as basketball. Anderson,
standing guard for the Thota Delts,
Btarted the but by shooting a goal for
the A. T. O.'s. Lilly contributed to
the entertainmentt by taking a seat
in the bleachers when there was
nothing doing in bis sector.
On the side of real basketball play
ing, Neil entertained with some neat
basket shooting for the winners, and
was chief point winner for hia team.
The Alpha Tau Omegas won 15 to 7,
counting the basket presented to them
to Anderson. *
The Theta Delta Chi lineup was
Lilliy, Boucher, Cecil, Barham and
Anderson.
