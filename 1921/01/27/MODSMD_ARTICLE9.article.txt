# UNIVERSITY HIGH ONABLE TO STOP FRESHMAN FIVE
## Seay's Team Runs Up 35 to 13 Score on Berkeley Five; Jensen and Atwell Star 
### 
In their regular Wednesday night
[ basketball game the freshman five had
little trouble in defeating the quintet
from University High School of Berke
ley by a score of 35 to 13. From the
very start the Babes rushed their oppo
nents off their feet, and although the
transbay lads did their best, in no stage
of the game could they compete with
the shifty freshmen. Poor shooting and
plentiful fouls caused the play to be
come uninteresting at time, but now and
then, especially during the second half,
the prep school players showed real
class, which caused the freshmen to do
their utmost. Consistent fumbling on
the part of the high school team gave
the freshmen good opportunities to show
their skill and knowledge of the game.
The game was rough throughout and,
literally speaking, the most of it was
played on the floor.
Jansen was undoubtedly the star of
the first half. When at center he was
always in the middle of the fight, and he
alone was responsible for eight of the
points chalked up by the freshmen. The
Babes in this half resorted to their usual
type of short passing play with an occa
sional long pass to McHose, who was
generally to be found in the vicinity of
the basket. The Babes succeeded in
scoring twenty-four points to their vis
itors' four.
The freshmen started the second half
off with a bang, but shortly after the
whistle had blown Jansen sprained his
ankle and was unable to continue with
the play. His placc was taken by Man
nocir. The freshmen seemed to be un
able to get together in this period of
play. Their short passing game, which
has always been one of the freshmen
specialties, seemed to fail for the first
time. They then tried longer passes, but
these either went wild or were broken
up by the high school players. Later
Granger and McHose got working and
succeeded in tallying a few more points
for the freshmen. Their rally was too
near the end of the game, however, and
it was impossible to make the score
which they had made in the first half.
Bob Atwill showed good form at run
ning guard. He shot well from the
middle of the court and his passing
generally placed the forwards in a bet
ter position to shoot.
The freshmen have now won every
game so far this season. This game,
like the rest of the games, shows that
the freshman basketball team .is not a
team composed of stars, but a team
composed of good players who have
learned the art of working together.
The lineup of last night's game was:
Stanford—McHose, f.; Granger, f.;
Jansen, c.; Mannocir, c.; Smith, g.;
Atwill, g.
