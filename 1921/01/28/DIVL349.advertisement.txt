When May Students
Buy Jewelry?
By /. F. Haiglit, Adv. Mgr. Samuels Jewelry Co.
Mighty little jewelry was bought by undergrads
when I was in College. A fountain pen, a watch
and a fiat pin was about the limit. Occasionally
some resplendent co-ed blossomed forth with a
solitaire, the gift of an unusually opulent upper
I' classman. But most of us had to wait a year or
two after going to work before we made the grade.
I Fact is, we didn't have the money in those days
and in that country, unless we earned it ourselves.
Nowdays, I understand, College boys in California
are frequently blessed with wealthy parents and
I it is not inconceivable that they may, with proprie
ty, purchase an occasional piece of jewelry for a
I birthday or other gift, or a diamond engagement
ring. But however wealthy, there's a limit set by
good taste. What is that limit? I want to know.
And who better than the students themselves, is
qualified to inform me? For the best answer to
this question from a Stanford student this firm
will award a prize of $25.00 cash. Second and
third prizes of $15.00 and $10.00. It costs
nothing to compete. Full details of the conditions
will be sent upon request.

When May Students
Buy Jewelry?
By /. F. Haiglit, Adv. Mgr. Samuels Jewelry Co.
Mighty little jewelry was bought by undergrads
when I was in College. A fountain pen, a watch
and a fiat pin was about the limit. Occasionally
some resplendent co-ed blossomed forth with a
solitaire, the gift of an unusually opulent upper
I' classman. But most of us had to wait a year or
two after going to work before we made the grade.
I Fact is, we didn't have the money in those days
and in that country, unless we earned it ourselves.
Nowdays, I understand, College boys in California
are frequently blessed with wealthy parents and
I it is not inconceivable that they may, with proprie
ty, purchase an occasional piece of jewelry for a
I birthday or other gift, or a diamond engagement
ring. But however wealthy, there's a limit set by
good taste. What is that limit? I want to know.
And who better than the students themselves, is
qualified to inform me? For the best answer to
this question from a Stanford student this firm
will award a prize of $25.00 cash. Second and
third prizes of $15.00 and $10.00. It costs
nothing to compete. Full details of the conditions
will be sent upon request.
