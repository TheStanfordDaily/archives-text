# "BABE" QUINTET PLAYS OAKLAND SATURDAY NIGHT
## Freshman Squad, Weakened by Loss of Jansen, Center, Expects Hard Contest 
### 
The freshmen, recovered from their
game last Wednesday night, will meet
Oakland High School here tomorrow
night at 7 p.m. The Oakland team
makes the third of the trans-bay
teams to come down here in the last
week. The other two have gone down
under overwhelming scores and the
babes are confident they will hand
the same sort of a beating to the
northern quintet tomorrow.

In the last two games the fresh
men have not showed the form they
had in the early part of the season
when it has come to ringing the bas
ket. The team work has constantly
improved and the handling of the ball
is better by most of the members of
the team, but the basket-shooting in
the field was poor in Wednesday
night's contest. Jansen made most
consistent shots during the game, run
ning up eight points in the first
period.
Jansen's injury will keep him out
of the game for at least a week until
the ankle gets strong enough for hard
work again. He has only suffered
a sprain, however, and will be back
in time to get in shape again before
the big game at the end of the fresh
man season. Jansen is probably the
most aggressive of the freshmen. His
weight, height, and cleverness with
the ball make him the outstanding
figure in the contests. Without him
tomorrow night, the squad will pre
sent a different line-up all around
than has been used before. The two
forwards will probably be the same
but the other three positions are in
doubt. Smith, Mannocir, and Strong,
are possibilities for center, with Wit
tenberg, Atwell, Taylor, and Wright j
for the guard positions.
