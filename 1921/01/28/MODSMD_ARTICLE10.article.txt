# BASEBALL ARTISTS ARE PRACTICING ON INDOOR FIELD
## Many Men Out For Squad; Pitching' Staff Has Places Open, Frosh Outlook Good 
### 
With practice beginning as soon as the
weather will permit, the Stanford var
sity and freshman baseball nines will
start intensive training for the 1921
season. Practice was to have started a
week ago, but due to the recent rains
it was impossible to use the diamond.
Men interested in baseball, however,
have been working out in the gym, and
Coach Seay, who is to coach the nines
for this season, is giving the players the
once over.
A championship varsity ought to be
turned out this season, as there are seven
or eight of the players back from last
year's varsity, and about the same num
ber of men who made their numerals on
the freshman squad. With these men as
a nucleus, and the large number of trans
fers and new men that have shown up,
a varsity that far surpasses previous
years ought easily to be formed. The
team will be especially strong in the
infield this season, as men like Kalian,
Holstein, Crowe, and Maillot are back
and are going strong. Wayland, Mitch
ell, and Kline, outfielders on last year's
nine, are also out for practice.
Draper is the only letter man back
who is out for the pitching end of the
game. There is a great need for pitchers
and this is one of the difficulties to be
overcome. Holding down the other end
of the battery is "Doug" Bundy, the
captain of this year's nine. His brainy
work in the games of last year pulled
the Cardinals through many tight places.
Backing him up for the same position
is George Green, captain of last year's
freshman nine. Many other players
from last year are back and arc putting
up a fight for their respective positions,
making strong competition all around.

As yet little can be said of the fresh
man nine. It is known, however, that
many players who made splendid high
school records are here and are going
out for the nine. Coach Seay is espe
cially anxious to get a line on these new
men. and all -men interested in baseball
are asked to report to him at once.

Freshman and varsity practice will be
resumed Monday, according to Captain
"Doug" Bundy, if the weather permits.
