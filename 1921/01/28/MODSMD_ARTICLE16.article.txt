## Coach Powell Will Use Same Line-up Against Fast Team From Southern College 
### 
Stanford meets the University of
Southern California basketball varsity
tomorrow night at Encina Gymnasium,
according to announcement today from
the graduate manager's office. The Stan
ford freshmen will play Oakland High
School in the preliminary game.

After the University of Nevada can
celled its game here next week, Ed.
Martin, graduate manager, immediately
got in touch with the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club for a game there tomorrow
night. The clubmen could not bring the
Cardinals south until next week, and
U. S. C. had an open date, so the
Irojans will be Stanford's next oppo
nent.
Indications are that the game tomor
row night will be the hardest of the
season. U. S. C. was barely nosed out
by the Los Angeles Athletic Club quin
tet earlier in the season, and the latter
team holds the reputation of being the
only team that has beaten California this
year. The outcome of tomorrow night's
affair will enable basketball fans to get
a comparative line on the Stanford and
California teams before the big series
with the Bruins.

Coach Powell put bis squad through
its last practice of the week this after
noon. He will probably start his usual
lineup against the Trojans and substi
tute Jimmy Davies for "Lefty" Rogers
at forward i nthe second half. Captain
Adams, Righter; Richmond, and Mills
are certain to start.
The admission charge to the game will
not be definitely announced until to
morrow.
