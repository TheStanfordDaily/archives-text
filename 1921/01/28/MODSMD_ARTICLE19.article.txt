# INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION
## 
### 
Men come to the University to learn, and while primarily they gain
most of their knowledge in the classroom, a large amount can profit
ably gathered o«i the outside through intelligent disfussion of small
groups. Whenever men get together they will always discuss or argue
some subject, and perhaps the most intelligent discussion arises or
should arise in meetings of organized In the early days of the
universities,, students banded themselves into societies or organizations
for the express purpose of debating or discussing important subjects,
and through the means of these societies some of the greatest political
doctrines and political thinkers were developed. The debating society is
perhaps the direct descendant of the old political discussion group, but
it largely fails in its purpose because the modern student is unwilling to
sit through a dry evening listening to some one else talk.
Informal meetings give rise to the best and most intelligent discus
sion, and it is well known that conversation flows much more freely over
the banquet board than in a stiff and formal meeting. The majority of
the Stanford honor societies meet in an informal way over the table at
regular meetings, but the topics of conversation are not generally di
rected in an intelligent manner, and generally amount to mere pleasan
try. Honor societies are the object of much attack, but it would seem
that-if some effort were made by these self-chosen groups to plan intelli
gent discussions for their meetings, they would be doing a great service
for themselves, and get real profit out of their gatherings.
There are always men who are willing to meet with such organiza
tions, whether professional or otherwise, and talk informally on subjects
with which they are familiftr, such as politics, philosophy, science, and
religion. Informal talks of this nature naturally would invite discus
sion from those present, and with the result that the members should
leave the meeting feeling that the evening was not entirely lost, as is
generally the case now.
The national organizations of some of the fraternities have talked
of forming speaker's bureaus of their prominent members to visit the
various chapters and give informal talks on subjects ou which they are
authorities. Such a move would be of great benefit to the fraternity
men and a great aid to the fraternity system.
