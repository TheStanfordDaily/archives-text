# SOCCER VARSITY PLAYS ITALIAN CLUB TOMORROW
## First Team Will Play in San Francisco; Second Team Plays American Legion 
### 
San Francisco will be the scene of
tomorrow's headliner on the soccer
bill, when Coach Maloney's fire-eaters
clash with the experts of the Italian
Club of that city. The other soccer
event will take place here on the
turf, at 3:00 when the American Legi
on "team of the Palo Alto Post, hooks
up with the second varsity team. The
second varsity will have some free
men picked from the '24 squad in its
line-up.
As "far as the importance of the
game at San Francisco, Stanford's
varsity holds the same position as that
occupied before the fracas last week
end; one point ahead of the nearest
contender, the Olympic Club. But
this one point is good enough to in
sure the trophy if the Cardinal waves
triumphantly over the next two games,
and there is every indication it will.
At the same time Stanford meets
the Italians, the Olympics meet Cali
fornia's team in what should be a
hard-fought battle. The clubmen rea
lize that if they lose there is abso
lutely no chance of first place for
them, as they can ojily get it now
through a Stanford defeat. The Blue
and Gold players are willing to exert
themsel\i> in order to revenge the
defeat plastered on tlit?m by the "O"
some time ago. Odds favor the club
rpen, and by all the dope they are
bound to win.
The varsity, however, also has the
well-known statistics on its side, for
if past performances are worth a
Mexican dollar, the Italians are doom
ed to console themselves with what
sympathy they can get by being beat
en. But overconfidence never yet won
a game, and Maloney's men realize
that they must play their best to be
sure of a victory.
The team as a whole is in good
shape. It took some time for it to
recover from the hard game with the
Olympic Club, but everything is in
shape now and should prove to be
satisfactory. Captain Newlands has
his team arranged in practically the
same formation as for last week-end.
Orlo Hays, who has had experience
with the team before, but has not been
with the squad this quarter until now,
has joined the team and should prove
an effective addition to the Cardinal
strength. He will play with Adams
at full back.
The Legion game with the second
varsity is in the nature of a workout
for the Palo Alto team, and they
should meet some strong opposition
from tho second-string men.
Legion team is shaping up very well,
and upon its entrance into the league
pcbednle with the other regular teams
will get down to work in earnest.
The line-up for the varsity game
with the Italian Club is as follows:
Newlands, goal; Adams, Hays, full
backs; Wing, Robinson, Gorman, half
backs; Mendoza, outside rightt; Camp
bell, inside right; Weller, centcr,
Mead, Inside left; Clark, outside left.
Coach Maloney wishes it announced
that the players should be present at
the Southern Pacific station to leave
on the 1:20 train tomorrow.

At the same time Stanford meets
the Italians, the Olympics meet Cali
fornia's team in what should be a
hard-fought battle. The clubmen rea
lize that if they lose there is abso
lutely no chance of first place for
them, as they can ojily get it now
through a Stanford defeat. The Blue
and Gold players are willing to exert
themsel\i> in order to revenge the
defeat plastered on tlit?m by the "O"
some time ago. Odds favor the club
rpen, and by all the dope they are
bound to win.
The varsity, however, also has the
well-known statistics on its side, for
if past performances are worth a
Mexican dollar, the Italians are doom
ed to console themselves with what
sympathy they can get by being beat
en. But overconfidence never yet won
a game, and Maloney's men realize
that they must play their best to be
sure of a victory.
The team as a whole is in good
shape. It took some time for it to
recover from the hard game with the
Olympic Club, but everything is in
shape now and should prove to be
satisfactory. Captain Newlands has
his team arranged in practically the
same formation as for last week-end.
Orlo Hays, who has had experience
with the team before, but has not been
with the squad this quarter until now,
has joined the team and should prove
an effective addition to the Cardinal
strength. He will play with Adams
at full back.
The Legion game with the second
varsity is in the nature of a workout
for the Palo Alto team, and they
should meet some strong opposition
from tho second-string men.
Legion team is shaping up very well,
and upon its entrance into the league
pcbednle with the other regular teams
will get down to work in earnest.
The line-up for the varsity game
with the Italian Club is as follows:
Newlands, goal; Adams, Hays, full
backs; Wing, Robinson, Gorman, half
backs; Mendoza, outside rightt; Camp
bell, inside right; Weller, centcr,
Mead, Inside left; Clark, outside left.
Coach Maloney wishes it announced
that the players should be present at
the Southern Pacific station to leave
on the 1:20 train tomorrow.
San Francisco will be the scene of
tomorrow's headliner on the soccer
bill, when Coach Maloney's fire-eaters
clash with the experts of the Italian
Club of that city. The other soccer
event will take place here on the
turf, at 3:00 when the American Legi
on "team of the Palo Alto Post, hooks
up with the second varsity team. The
second varsity will have some free
men picked from the '24 squad in its
line-up.
As "far as the importance of the
game at San Francisco, Stanford's
varsity holds the same position as that
occupied before the fracas last week
end; one point ahead of the nearest
contender, the Olympic Club. But
this one point is good enough to in
sure the trophy if the Cardinal waves
triumphantly over the next two games,
and there is every indication it will.
