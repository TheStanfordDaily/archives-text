# STATISTICS SHOW THAT OREGON MEN MARRY IN COLLEGE
## 
### 
Statistics recently compiled at the
Oregon Agricultural College disclose
the fact that one one hundred and
thirty-seven regularly enrolled students
of that institution are married—and this
excludes "college widows," or, for that
matter, widows of any kind.
Only thirteen of this number are
co-eds, making nine times as" many men
married as there are women. This is to
be considered due to the superior intel
lect and foresight of the feminine sex.
Both the men and their wives are
students in but eight of the 128 families
represented. In five other instances the
women have continued their education,
while their "hubbies" —mostly profes
sors—are doing their level best to keep
the family larders filled.
"Hump! It sure looks as if a girl
ought to get all the education she wants
before she marries—fat chance she has
of getting it afterwards," exclaimed one
of the girls who hasn't ventured.
The percentage of college-trained
women among the wives is compara
tively small, statistics proceed to show.
Seventy-five per cent of the married
students are rehabilitation men, whose
wives swore to "love, honor, and obey"
before coming to the college. The re
maining one-fourth is made up of regu
lar students, principally juniors and
seniors.
"That's all now," came a deep voice
over the wire, as a fraternity man com
plied with the request to give out the
"dope" on the number of married men
belonging to his house. "You might wait
a little while—we've got some others
who are awful near it," he added with
a chuckle.
