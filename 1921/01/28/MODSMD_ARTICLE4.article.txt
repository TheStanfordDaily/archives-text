"The boathouse at the lake, an old
Stanford landmark, is about to be torn
down. The lake is to be permanent,
and the boathouse should be saved to
provide the needed facilities for
canoeing and swimming. We stu
dents must put the house in first class
condition to save it from condemna
tion.

"An appeal is hereby made to every
member of the freshman class to meet
at the Lake Saturday morning, at 8
o'clock, and save for Stanford this
time-honored landmark. This is your
first opportunity, Class of 1924, to do
something constructive for your Alma
Mater. The student body has confi
dence that you will put it over big—
the boathouse must be saved!"
