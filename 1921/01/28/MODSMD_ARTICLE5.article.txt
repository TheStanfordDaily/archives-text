# C. E. PERSONS DESCRIBES WORK OF PUBLICITY MAN
## Newspaper Point of View is Necessary For Success of Prespective Press Agent 
### 
Mr. C. Edward Persons, in his talk
to the Journalists' Association last night,
presented the work of the publicity man
of the future as an enterprise of far
greater s<;ope and responsibility than
anything ever undertaken by a so-called
"press agent." "I would not call him a
'publicity man,'" he said, "but would
give him such title as 'public relations
man.' His duties are far more extensive
than merely passing out news concern
ing his organization, although, so far as
there is news, this falls within his
province.
"He must be regarded as holding one
of the most important positions in the
whole organization. He must be a part
of the organization and the organization
must be a part of him. He must know
intimately all its operations and its plans
and he must be qualified to advise au
thoritatively concerning the effect on the
public of any policy or proposal of his
employer.
"The public relations man must be
well trained in newspaper work, since
lie must understand the newspaper point
of view and comprehend what the editor
and reporter regard as news in order
that he may represent his employer fairly
to the public, but his functions are not
primarily ihose of a news dispenser.
His duties comprehend all the relations
of the organization of which lie is a
part with the public. He must be heart
and soul enthusiastic over the objects
and activities of his organization—if lie
cannot be he ought to go to some other
organization where he can be.

"There will inevitably come times
when his purposes and those the
newspaper will be in conflict. He repre
sents his organization and ought not
to be expected to give out injurious
information about that organization any
more than the president or any other
officer would be expected to. A good
newspaper man at such tttnes must get
the news which he conceives ought to be
obtained. This does not weaken the
public relations man's position; on the
contrary, it strengthens it with the
newspapers and it is a self-respecting
attitude. His job, so far as the news
papers go, is to furnish them accurate
and reliable information, but if a time
comes when he, as any other officer of
his organization, must refuse to give
information which the newspapers from
their standpoint desire, they will respect
him for taking that position heartily.
Whether or not, then, they obtain and
publish this information, depends upon
their ability as reporters and their de
termination as to the value of the news/'
Persons pointed out also that a man
occupying such a responsible position
would have a great influence on his
organization internally since all depart
ments would unconsciously be influenced
to measure up to the standards, which
he, through his activities as a public
relations man, would set for the whole
organization.

papers go, is to furnish them accurate
and reliable information, but if a time
comes when he, as any other officer of
his organization, must refuse to give
information which the newspapers from
their standpoint desire, they will respect
him for taking that position heartily.
Whether or not, then, they obtain and
publish this information, depends upon
their ability as reporters and their de
termination as to the value of the news/'
Persons pointed out also that a man
occupying such a responsible position
would have a great influence on his
organization internally since all depart

organization.
Mr. C. Edward Persons, in his talk
to the Journalists' Association last night,
presented the work of the publicity man
of the future as an enterprise of far
greater s<;ope and responsibility than
anything ever undertaken by a so-called
"press agent." "I would not call him a
'publicity man,'" he said, "but would
give him such title as 'public relations
man.' His duties are far more extensive
than merely passing out news concern
ing his organization, although, so far as
there is news, this falls within his
province.
"He must be regarded as holding one
of the most important positions in the
whole organization. He must be a part
of the organization and the organization
must be a part of him. He must know
intimately all its operations and its plans
and he must be qualified to advise au
thoritatively concerning the effect on the
public of any policy or proposal of his
employer.
"The public relations man must be
well trained in newspaper work, since
lie must understand the newspaper point
of view and comprehend what the editor
and reporter regard as news in order
that he may represent his employer fairly
to the public, but his functions are not
primarily ihose of a news dispenser.
His duties comprehend all the relations
of the organization of which lie is a
part with the public. He must be heart
and soul enthusiastic over the objects
and activities of his organization—if lie
cannot be he ought to go to some other
organization where he can be.

"There will inevitably come times
when his purposes and those the
newspaper will be in conflict. He repre
sents his organization and ought not
to be expected to give out injurious
information about that organization any
more than the president or any other
officer would be expected to. A good
newspaper man at such tttnes must get
the news which he conceives ought to be
obtained. This does not weaken the
public relations man's position; on the
contrary, it strengthens it with the
newspapers and it is a self-respecting
attitude. His job, so far as the news
papers go, is to furnish them accurate
and reliable information, but if a time
comes when he, as any other officer of
his organization, must refuse to give
information which the newspapers from
their standpoint desire, they will respect
him for taking that position heartily.
Whether or not, then, they obtain and
publish this information, depends upon
their ability as reporters and their de
termination as to the value of the news/'
Persons pointed out also that a man
occupying such a responsible position
would have a great influence on his
organization internally since all depart
ments would unconsciously be influenced
to measure up to the standards, which
he, through his activities as a public
relations man, would set for the whole
organization.
