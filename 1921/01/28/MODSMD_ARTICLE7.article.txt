# PROMINENT LOCAL PEOPLE WILL TALK ON RELIEF WORK
## Dr. Jordan and Mrs. Hoover Among Speakers to Deliver Talks at Tuesday Assembly 
### 
Dr. Jordan, Mrs. Herbert Hoover,
and Mortimer Kline, '21, will be speak
ers at the student assembly at 10 o'clock
Tuesday morning. Professor H. R.
Eairclough, chairman of the Stanford
committee representing the European
Students' Fund of the American Relief
Administration, will preside, and the
subject of the assembly will be this
latest enterprise of Herbert Hoover.

Little has been heard so far of the
European Students' Fund established by
Hoover under the American Relief Ad
ministration, although it is a subject
which appeals especially to American
college students.

In response to the appeals for assist
ance froin the faculties and students of
European universities, President Wilbur
some time ago appointed a special com
mittee of local Stanford people to act
on these appeals. On this committee
Professor Fairclough represents the
faculty; Mrs. T. T. T. Gregory, '98, the
alumni; and Philip Richards, '17, the
students. This committee has been made
the Stanford representative of the
project which Herbert Hoover set up in
his American Relief Administration to
extend aid to students and teachers in
the universities of Europe.

Hoover is directing the work of this
organization in accordance \*ith the sur
vey made by representatives of his or
ganization and by the World's Student
Christian Organization through Austria,
Hungary, Poland, Jugo-Slavia, Russia,
the Baltic States, Asia Minor, and
among the foreign students in Czecho
slovakia. France and Switzerland.

Tlic work among the students in these
countries is taking the practical form
which might be expected of an under
taking directed by Hoover. One of the
chief difficulties among these students is
that even when they are strong enough
to be able to do outside work they can
not find employment. The American Re
lief Administration is therefore provid
ing means by which they may aid them
selves through their own labor. Kitch
ens are established where they do the
work and farms are cultivated by them
to raise vegetables for the kitchen, and
in other ways they are assisted in work
ing out self-help schemes.

These matters and other phases of
the work will be explained by the speak
ers at the assembly.
