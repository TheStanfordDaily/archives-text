Who Can W i n
This Prize?
The Samuels Jewelry Co of San Francisco offers
$25.00 for the best, and $15.00 and $10.00 for the
second and third answers to the question "When
May Students Buy Jewelry?"
By /. F. IJaight, Adv. Mgr.
\
What is the limit set by good taste on the articles
of jewelry that may be purchased by a student?
This is the question we want answered in 200-
word essays by Stanford Students. Undergradu
ates are not presumed to be good customers of the
Jeweler but in these days of great prosperity it
may be that many have sufficient funds supplied
by their own efforts or by wealthy parents to per
mit them an occasional purchase of a birthday or
other gift, or an engagement ring.
It costs nothing to compete. Write for a sheet
giving instructions for contestants and go to it.
The awards will be made by someone on your
faculty, if I can arrange it, or by a couple of San
Francisco Advertising writers. The contest is open
to all classes. The winning essays will be pub
lished in the Daily Palo Alto and the information
will be used by this firm only as a guide in adver
tising our business to College people.
