# AGREEMENT MADE BY GROCERS AND BUYERS
## GROCERS TO SELL AT LOWER PRICES IF GIVEN VOLUME OF CAMPUS TRADE Prices Committee Concludes That Daily Palo Alto's Chart Was Hardly Fair 
### 
Palo Alto grocers agreed Thursday
night to sell goods to campus buyers at
prices on a level with those elsewhere,
provided the house managers give them
the volume of campus trade. This action
followed a campaign launched by The
Daily Palo Alto to bring local prices
down, and which culminated in a meet
ing of grocers and representatives of
fraternities and eating clubs last Thurs
day, at which both sides of the case
were presented and a decision made by
a "fair prices" committee.
This committee has reported that the
chart published by The Daily Palo Alto
two weeks ago can hardly be considered
a fair indication of existing conditions
becausc of a variation in stores, methods
and time of delivery, brands and grades
and fluctuation of daily prices.
The house managers, at a meeting Fri
day, agreed to assure the grocers the
greater amount of the purchases and
have appointed a committee to make
monthly investigations and reports. This
committee is composed of P. F. Camp
bell, '20, A. W. Taylor, '22, A. B. Mc-
Alpine, '23, G. M. Kyle, '18, and J. L.
Phillips, '20.
The report made by the "fair prices"
committee after the hearing last week
follows:
Representatives ot the Stanford house
managers, the local retail grocers, a
wholesale grocery firm, the Civic
League, the Chamber of Commerce, and
The Daily Palo Alto, appeared recently
before the committee appointed to
examine the local price situation as com
pared with that of surrounding cities.
The committee examined the figures se
cured from firms in San Jose, Redwood
City, and San Francisco by a repre
sentative of The Daily Palo Alto, com
pared several of the recent bills re
ceived by fraternity houses for gro
ceries with the wholesale prices prevail
ing at the time of purchase, examined
recent invoice prices and prices charged
at retail, heard an explanation of the
conditions of the market from a member
of a wholesale firm, gave â€¢ all present
opportunity to tell what prices had been
found elsewhere or charged by local
merchants, and asked the merchants
present to answer questions or explain
situations presented.
The committee sums up the discussion
of the conditions presented as follows:
1. We do not consider that the letter
submitted was fair becausc it carried
no statement of its purpose and was
partially anonymous.
2. The lists published as a result of
the answers to this letter show: (a)
variation in stores between wholesalers,

retailers, and "cash anil carry" which
are beyond proper comparison; (b) the
introduction into the lists of "leaders";
(c) variations in time and method of
delivery; (d) variations in brands and
grades; (e) fluctuation of daily prices.
3. Prices submitted in the discussion
fail to appreciate the difference of the
size of orders, some being delivered
once a month, some once a week, and
others necessitating several deliveries
daily.
4. A comparison of a bill of goods
purported to be at wholesale price with
the prevailing wholesale prices at the
time (as far as brands could be com
pared) showed a difference of about 7
per cent above the prevailing prices.
5. The price comparison between large
