### 
"The future of San Francisco and
her Pacific trade depends on the sti
mulation of local industries," declared
N. A. Davies, San Francisco business
man and correspondent for several
trade journals and commercial maga
zines, at the meeting of the Stanford
Economics Club, Thursday night.
"The Panama Canal has made it
practically as easy to ship from New
York to the Orient as from San
Francisco, so if western ports are to
develop as commercial centers, they
must become producing centers.
Many large concerns are developing
in the city, and several are moving in
from the East."
Davies was one of a series of speak
ers from San Francisco's Foreign
Trade Club invited to address the
Stanford Club by Washington Conolly,
'21, president of the organization. He
spoke on "San Francisco's Empire of
Trade."
