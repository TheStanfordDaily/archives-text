# SATISFACTORY RESULTS

### 
The meeting" between the representatives of the Stanford .campus
and the Palo Alto grocers held Thursday night, in which the Stanford
iinen attempted to show that grocery prices were from 6 to 7 per cent
higher in "Palo Alto than in surrounding towns resulted in considerable
benefit to the fraternities, sororities, and eating clubs that joined in the
movement. The greatest gain comes from the fact that the grocers con
sented to give the campits organizations prices equal to those quoted
from the nearby towns on the condition that the House Manager's Or
ganization would deal largely with the Palo Alto stores. ;
Despite the fact that the arbitrators decided that the comparative
prices submitted were not a fair indication of the price level #1 'alo Alto
and in the nearby towns, there is evidence to show that grocery prices
have come down in Palo Alto since the publication of the price chart.
The second direct-benefit from the movement is that the house man
agers are now banded together in a working organization and are able
to deal directly with the grocers, and through a permanent committee
they are able to keep in touch with outside prices monthly and be in a
position to buy in large quantities wherever the,prices are best.
The meeting also resulted in a better understanding between the
grocers and the house managers. The Stanford committee expressed
the desire of the house managers to buy in Palo Alto wherever possible
because they thought it their duty to support the city. On the other
hand the grocers assured the committee that it was their wish to help
the campus organizations and to aid them to buy to their best advantage.
Titmouse managers now possess a working organization and it is
their duty to watch the credit of each eating group to see that nothing
is done to injure the credit of the organization as a whole. At present
the credit of all the fraternities and sororities is good, and it must be
kept in that condition. The House Managers' Organization must, and
it is their intention, to watch the market and takw advantage of every
favorable opportunity to buy cheaply, and they should throw the volume
of their trade to Palo Alto if possible.
