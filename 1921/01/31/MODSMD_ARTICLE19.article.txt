Stanford athletics received a big boost with the announcement of the
trip that the baseball Varsity will make next summer to the Orient. The
last team to make the trip to China and Japan left the campus in 1913,
and Stanford has been in need of advertisement of this sort for som<;
time. The baseball men receive the announcement with considerable
satisfaction, for they have been working for such a trip for several
years, and they are fortunate in securing the realization of their efforts
at a time when the prospects are good for a strong varsity. Graduate
Manager Martin deserves considerable credit for his zeal in arranging
such a journey that will add to the prestige of Stanford athletics.
