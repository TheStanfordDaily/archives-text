# RIVAL ALLIANCE TO BIG THREE TO BE FORMED IN NORTH
## 
### 
Intercollegiate warfare is seen in the
announcement, coming immediately
after Oregon's offer to Gilmour Dobie,
that plans are almost complete for the
formation of a "little three," made up of
the University of Oregon, Oregon Agri
cultural College, and Washington State
College. The members of this triple
alliance will, at least in all matters per
taining to football, be rivals of the "big
three," which Stanford, California, and
Washington have recently formed.
The members of the new organization
will not be permitted, according to the
report, to schedule any games with the
University of Washington. The students
of the colleges in the Northwest feel
rather hostile toward the Seattle Uni
versity because of the latter's apparent
preference for the association with the
California universities instead of the
schools in its own region.
If the proposed boycott is carried out
the University of Washington will have
some difficulty in securing suitable
games next season. Football on the
coast will not be benefited by the new
association, unless it sees fit to work in
harmony with the other universities.
