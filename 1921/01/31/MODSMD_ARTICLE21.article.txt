# CHINESE CLUB GIVES $200 TO RELIEF FUND
## 
### 
The Chinese Club of Stanford, which
is composed of Chinese students who at
tend the University, has given $200 for
the relief of the famine victims of China.
Conditions are very bad in the Far East,
and a fund is being raised in the United
States to send money to alleviate the
suffering as far as possible.
Not onl\* has the Chinese Club at
Stanford sent money to the aid of their
starving countrymen, but in all the uni
versities the various foreign clubs have
raised considerable sums for the fund.
An appeal is being made for voluntary
contributions, as there will be no organ
ized drive.
Checks should he sent to the "Chinese
Relief Fund" at the Bank of Palo Alto,
or to Dr. David Starr Jordan.
