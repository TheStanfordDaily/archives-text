# SOCCER ELEVEN RETAINS LEAD IN LEAGUE RACE
## Varsity Annexes New Victory By Defeating Italian Club of San Franciscoâ€”1 to 0 
### 
Stanford's soccer machine was not
halted in its march to victory Saturday
afternoon, for when the Cardinal eleven
left San Francisco the Italian Club was
on the round end of a 1-0 score. The
score would indicate that the game was
not won very easily, but the fact is that
during the first half StanforcJ played
with only ten men, and this handicap
undoubtedly accounted for the small
margin of victory.
During the first half the Cardinal ma
chine, with one cog missing, held the
Italian Club to a tie, and neither team
had scored by the time the half ended.
As the second half began, Stanford, with
eleven playing, clubmen and
succeeded in garnering the one point
that was necessary to win. Campbell
made the score.
The game was played at the Stadium
at Golden Gate Park. The field was in
pretty fair condition, but a stiff wind
swept over it and hindered the playing,
especially when it came to accurate
shooting.
This was the next to the last league
game on the varsity schedule. The final
clash cotnes next Saturday, when Cap*v
tain Newlands and his men hope to leave
the Chinese Y. M. C. A. mourning over

ers for the league leadership, the Olym
pics, won from California Saturday, and
so are still just as close behind as ever.
