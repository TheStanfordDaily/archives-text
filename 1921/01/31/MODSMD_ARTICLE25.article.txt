# FREMONT POST PLANS TO HAVE CLUB ROOMS
## 
### 
Fremont Post No. 52 of the Amer
ican Legion will soon have new club
rooms, according to the latest report
from the committee appointed for that
purpose. No definite building has been
decided upon, but the committee ex
pects to report some definite results at
the next meeting.
An unusual feature of the cluhrooms
will be a "dummy canteen," where mem
bers can go at any time and, by signing
up an I. O. U., help themselves to candy,
tobacco, and drinks.
Among the furnishings of the rooms
will be a fireplace, kitchen range, phono
graph, pool tables and card tables. The
fireplace, range, phonograph and two
cords of wood have been donated to the
Post and will be installed as soon as the
rooms arc ready.
