# FRESHMAN FIVE DEFEATS BAY TEAM BY ODDS 29-25
## Babes Are Unable to Combat Aggressive Play of Oakland Quintet Until Last Quarter 
### 
Last Saturday night's basketball game
between the freshmen and Oakland High
School fives proved to be the closest
and hardest fought game that the fresh
melt have experienced so far this sea
son. The Cardinal team won 29-25.
From the very start of the game the
Oakland quaintet took the aggressive
and tallied three field goals before the
Babes got under way. This put the
freshmen under a handicap that they
were unable to overcome in the first
half. In the second period, however,
they came back with some good guard
ing and passing and not only succeeded
in holding but in outplaying their oppo
nents in the fastest part of the game.
At no time in the game were the fresh
men sure of winning. Plentiful foul
shots were called on both sides and had
it not been that McHose converted every
one of the nine fouls called on the high
school players and that their adversaries
only threw three out of the seven fouls
called on the freshmen, the 1924 aggre
gation would have undoubtedly met de
feat at the hands of the prep school lads,
as they threw two more field goals than
the freshman five.
The Oakland cage team lead the first
half by the score of 18-17. This is the
first time that the freshmen have been on
the little end of the score at mid-game.
Poor passing and the bunching of their
players gave their opponents a chance
to show some good passing and skillful
teamwork.
In the last period the Cardinal de
fense was strengthened by the addition
of Whittenbcrg at running guard. He
and Smith now worked up a good de
fensive system which allowed the for
wards to play nearer the basket. This
type of play soon began to tally, for not
only were the transbay players held to
two field goals, but the freshmen were
able to build up their end of the score.
The absence of Jensen, who has been
elected to captain the freshmen, was
probably one of the main reasons why
the balance did not hang more in the
favor of the frosh. Jensen plays center
and is a consistent point winner, and his
ability to guard keeps their opponents
from many points. He sprained his
ankle in the game with University High
and has been unable to play. It is doing
nicely, however, and he will undoubtedly
be able to play in the next game.
Saturday's lineups were:
Stanford Freshmen —McHose, f.;
Granger, f.T Reeder, c.; Smith, g.-c.;
Whittenbcrg, g.; Mannocir, c.; Coo
per, g.
Oakland High—Hoffman, f.; Sibbets,

Last Saturday night's basketball game
between the freshmen and Oakland High
School fives proved to be the closest
and hardest fought game that the fresh
melt have experienced so far this sea
son. The Cardinal team won 29-25.
From the very start of the game the
Oakland quaintet took the aggressive
and tallied three field goals before the
Babes got under way. This put the
freshmen under a handicap that they
were unable to overcome in the first
half. In the second period, however,
they came back with some good guard
ing and passing and not only succeeded
in holding but in outplaying their oppo
nents in the fastest part of the game.
At no time in the game were the fresh
men sure of winning. Plentiful foul
shots were called on both sides and had
it not been that McHose converted every
one of the nine fouls called on the high
school players and that their adversaries
only threw three out of the seven fouls
called on the freshmen, the 1924 aggre
gation would have undoubtedly met de
feat at the hands of the prep school lads,
as they threw two more field goals than
the freshman five.
The Oakland cage team lead the first
half by the score of 18-17. This is the
first time that the freshmen have been on
the little end of the score at mid-game.
Poor passing and the bunching of their
players gave their opponents a chance
to show some good passing and skillful
teamwork.
In the last period the Cardinal de
fense was strengthened by the addition
of Whittenbcrg at running guard. He
and Smith now worked up a good de
fensive system which allowed the for
wards to play nearer the basket. This
type of play soon began to tally, for not
only were the transbay players held to
two field goals, but the freshmen were
able to build up their end of the score.
The absence of Jensen, who has been
elected to captain the freshmen, was
probably one of the main reasons why
the balance did not hang more in the
favor of the frosh. Jensen plays center
and is a consistent point winner, and his
ability to guard keeps their opponents
from many points. He sprained his
ankle in the game with University High
and has been unable to play. It is doing
nicely, however, and he will undoubtedly
be able to play in the next game.
