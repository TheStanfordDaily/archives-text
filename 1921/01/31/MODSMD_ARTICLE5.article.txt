# MRS. HOOVER AND DR. JORDAN WILL TALK AT ASSEMBLY
## Stanford Band and Glee Club Will Participate; European Relief Will Be Discussed 
### 
The Stanford Band and the Glee
Club will both take part in the as
sembly at 10 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing. The band will play at the begin
ning and at the end of the assembly
and the Glee Club will sing "The Men
of Harlech," The Glee Club this year
has reached a t high level of perform
ance as was shown by its singing at
the San Francisco Symphony Orchest
ra concert last week and it was in
vited to take part in the assembly
with the idea that many of the cam
pus and Palo Alto residents will be
interested to hear them. The band
has been practicing regularly since
the beginning of the college year but
except at football time has been heard
very little on the campus.
The assembly will present the other
side of the distressing picture of the
European conditions painted by Sher
wood Eddy in his recent address on
the campus. Eddy told of the wide
hunger and suffering throughout Eu
rope. Dr. Jordan, Mrs. Herbert C.
Hoover and Mortimer Kline, '21, will
tell of the work that is being done
under American direction to overcome
these conditions and restore normal
life among the people of Europe.
Dr. Jordan has many correspondents
among the intellectual and political
leaders of Europe who write him about
the situation in their countries so that
he has almost a first-hand knowledge
of the progress towards normal condi
tions there.
The leader in relieving distress and
helping European peoples to regain
"their feet after the war is Herbert C.
Hoover. He began the Work as head
of the American Relief Admin
istration and now practically all the
relief agencies throughout, these na
tions have united under his direction
in the European Relief Council. He
is devoting all all of his time and ef
fort to this work. Mrs. Herbert ~C.
Hoover keeps in close touch with all
the activities of all the relief agencies
carrying on work under his direction
and recently has been malting a good
many talks to various American or
ganizations on the subject. She has
always been a popular speaker at
Stanford.
Of all the various organizations for
European relief which Herbert Hoover
has set up under the American Re
lief Administration the one which ap
peals most p&iticularly to university
men and women is the Students' Re
lief Fund which is directing the ef
forts to relieve distress among uni
versity students and faculty whose
suffering as the result of the war is
peculiarly acute. Mortimer Kline, '21,
has information about the work of
this fund and whai' it has been able
to accomplish.
The assembly tomorrow morning
has been called to arouse interest on
the Campus in the jelief work under
Herbert Hoover. Subscriptions for
the European Children's Relief have
been obtained without organizing a
campaign and a definite campaign on
behalf of the university students is
now being organized primarily
through living groups on the campus.
Tomorrow's assembly is for the pur
pose of explaining the situation which
every student ought to understand
but since the living groups will be
asked to contribute funds through
special agents of the local committee
for European Students' Relief, they
will not be asked to make any con- 1
tributioni or pledges of contributions
at tomorrow's assembly.
