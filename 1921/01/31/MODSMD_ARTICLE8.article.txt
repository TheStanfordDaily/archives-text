# VARSITY BEATS TROJANS; TAKES EIGHT STRAIGHT
## "Swede" Righter is Star of 34-14 Court Battle—Cardinal Too Fast for U. S. C. 
### 
They came, thew saw, but they fail
ed to put a stop to the Stanford run
of consecutive games won. Which is
by way of saying that the Cardinal
five won its eighth straight game by
defeating the Trojans of the Univer
sity of Southern California, 39 to 14.
It was an easy game for the Powell
ites. The southerners claimed sprain
ed ankles and said that they were
lost on such a large court but it was
simply a story of lack of class or of
facing too much class.
Coach Henderson failed to put the
customary two men on Righter, so
the "Swede" enjoyed a regular field
day. He easily took care of the one
guard and contributed seven field
goals to the Stanford score. Beside
his work on the offense his defensive
play was as usual, which means it
was high grade.
Bert Mills again scored more points
than any other player. His total score
was twenty-two points resulting from
ten field goals and two free throws.
The Trojar.s had neither offense nor
defense. They appeared to be com
pletely outclassed from . the first
whistle. The score at half time was
27 to 3 in favor of Stanford, so Coach
Powell shot in the second-string men
in the last half. The Los Angelenos
scored eleven points in this period
while the second varsity scored
twelve.
Boeck scored most of the points for
the visiting team. He dropped the
ball through the hoop four times in
the last half and converted one free
throw, making nine points.
