# PRATHER, MACCONEL, AND CLAFLIN ADDED TO'RAM'S HEAD CAST
## 
### 
Ned Prather, '23, has been added to
the Ram's Head cast, and is to take the
part of the Baby Vamp. Prather is to
be remembered for his excellent work
in last year's Ram's Head show as the
coy young lady of many charms.
Prather has just recently been elected
to membership in the Rani's Head So
ciety.
The part of the sentimental Italian,
Tony, also has a new characterizer, Der
inont Macconel, '23, recently of Hono
lulu. This is Macconel's first appearance
on the Stanford stage, but he is show
ing up well in rehearsals and is making
the character of Tony a very live part.
Another change in the cast was the
part of the Englishman, which is now
taken by Paul Claflin, '20. Claflin trans
ferred from Wisconsin in the autumn
quarter, and though he has never been
in campus dramatics, his work is well
known in Wisconsin. According to
Coach Seib, Claflin is handling the part
of the blase Englishman with skill that
is remarkably clever.
Both cast and chorus are working
hard and Seib is getting excellent re
sults. He says he has never worked with
a more willing or capable chorus. The
preparation for the play will be well
finished and the rough edges polished
by the date of its production, which is
February 11, in the Assembly Hall.
