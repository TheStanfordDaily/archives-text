# VARSITY 10 MEET ST. IGNATIUS FIVE TOMORROW NIGHT
## Last Pre-Conference Contest of Schedule to Be Played on Opposing Team's Floor 
### 
The Stanford varsity will go against
the St. Ignatius basketball live tomorrow
night on the St. Ignatius floor. A game
had been scheduled with Nevada on this
date, but since it was cancelled by the
Nevada aggregation Manager Connolly
arranged a game with the San Francisco
team.
The St. Ignatius five have a good
record, having held the California var
sity to a low score a week ago under
the disadvantage of playing on a strange
floor. Coach Powell does not look for
ward to an easy game tomorrow night.
The game was scheduled on the St.
Ignatius floor by Coach Powell in order
to accustom the players to playing for
eign courts before taking the Northern
trip.
Only eight or nine players will make
the trip to the city for the game. Coach
Powell will probably start the regular
five against the Saints, with Davies
changing off with Lefty Rogers in the
second half. Anderson, who has been
trying for the running guard position,
has been showing up well in practice
lately and will probably get a chance in
the game Wednesday. This is the last
pre-Conference game on ,the varsity
schedule, the University of Washington
opening a two-game series on thp local
court Monday,
