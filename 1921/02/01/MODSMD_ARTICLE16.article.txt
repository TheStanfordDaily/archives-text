# HELP HOOVER TO AID SUFFERING SUMS OF EUROPE
## CAMPUS SPEAKERS MAKE DRAMATIC APPEAL TO STANFORD PEOPLE TO HELP ALLEVIATE DESTITUTE MILLIONS Dr. Jordan Backs Movement to Make Local Campaign a Success 
### (By S. N. Pierce, '22 
Help relieve the distress of the European students that we may have an
educated and intelligent Europe in the next generation. This was the plea
made by Dr. Jordan, Mrs. Herbert Hoover, and Mortimer A. Kline, '21, at the
assembly this morning, called for the purpose of soliciting aid for the Europe
an Student's Relief, an organization formed by Herbert Hoover as an adjunct
of the American Relief Administration.
The conditions under which students are forced to live were graphically
pictured by Mrs. Hoover. Without money to buy the poor quality of food
that is found in Poland, Austria, Hungary, Germany, and the new republics of
Europe, the students who are strong enough are forced to seek work, and they
are generally unsuccessful in the quest of this because there is not enough
to go around.

Figures from (he three universities
to illustrate the deplorable condition
in Poland were quoted by the speaker
of the students. Fifteen per cent of
them had nj overcoats or other out
side garments. The students were
quartered six, seven, and eight in a
room, while over half of the rooms
were heatless. Twenty-six per cent
only had two meals a day. Sixty to
seventy cents is the monthly outlay
for food. There is no papef in any
of the affected areas and the result
is no nrt? bocks or new editions of
textbooks. For a girl to'earn enough
money to buy herself a new outfit of
the commonest clothing it is neces
sary to tutor 1,000 lessons.
"The universities of Europe have
always been a force for freedom, they
have kept up hope and courage when
their ideal seemed impossible of at
tainment. It is a sad paradox now
that freedom has arrived that some of
the very places that kept the fire of
liberty aglow are now in danger of
perishing."
The right plight of the professors
was related by Dr. Jordan. He told
of scholars, famous in their field of
work, who have died of staravation
and cold. He spoke of other men
forced to give up their profession and
find labor to earn enough money to
keop alive, sometimes, being forced to
give up their possessions and leave
the land which had been their home.
"The difficult task of feeding Europe
has been carried on by Herbert Hoov
er, a Stanford man, at a total cost
of less than the amount needed to
promote onq day the work of destruc
tion which was carried on for four
years.
"The students of today will be the
leaders of thfe next generation. If
we are going to have an enlightened
Europe in the next generation it is
necessary that we do something to
save the students and professors now.
The student appeal for the cause
was made by M. A. Kline, '21, He
said.
"This University gave the world
Herbert Hoover, who has set for the
world high ideals not equalled by any
, man with the possible exception of
| President Wilson. It is our duty to
back him up in this drive.
"The University of California fell
$2,000 short on quota but Stan
ford shall not be found wanting when
| the call comes."
Kline outlined" the plan which has
been adopted for the collection of the
; fund. On the basis of the number of
! students here the quota has been
figured at $3 per student "to keep a
student in a European university."
The Stanford Band and the Glee
Club both gave numbers at the as
sembly.
During the noon hour speakers visit
ed die various living groups on the
campus and collections were made.
The speaking and collections at the
women's houses was handled by Cap
and Gown.
P. H. Richards, '18, who is in charge
jof the student bod* collection an
| nounced that collections will be re
ceivable tomorrow at the booth in
the Administration Building, from 8
to 12, and from 1 to 3. He declared
that it was the desire of the committee
to finish up the drive as quickly as
possible.
The charter of your committee is
found in the action taken by this Asso
ciation at the evening session one year
ago, when it was voted that the chair
man "appoint a committee of three to
consider what measures thfc Association
may take to rid baseball of its objec
tionable features."
Their instructions are found in the
opening address of President Briggs at
the morning session, and in his ad
mirable article on "Amateur and Pro
fessional Sportsmanship in Baseball,"
published in Spalding's Official College
Baseball Annual for 1913. pages 5 and 7.
Your committee has for the time be
ing nothing to do with the difficult ques
tion of eligibility, nor with summer ball
in its relation to amateur sport. It is
concerned with what is appropriate and
desirable in the conduct of the game
itself, in order that the manners of
officials, players, and spectators may be
uniformly those of gentlemen, where
the highest ideals of fairnesfe and sports
manship shall be maintained, as is so
admirably done in intercollegiate tennis.
We do not think that anything should
be recommended winch would diminish
the virility of the game, or lessen the
scope of individual skill, or of clever
team work, but we earnestly contend
that strategy must no deteriorte into
trickery, and that the rules of the game
must be observed, not only in letter but
in spirit as well.
