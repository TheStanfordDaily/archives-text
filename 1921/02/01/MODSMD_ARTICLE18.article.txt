The great near *great among
the campus lnim'orists are invited to a
meeting by Editor Ross Fisher of the
Quad, 1o be held in the Quad office in
the Administration Building Thursday
afternoon at 2:30. The Quad razz con
test will be explained in detail by Fisher,
Though the closing date of the competi
tion. February 15, has been previously
announced, there are many features
which the editor desires to explain per
sonally those entering the contest.
An erroneous impression has arisen in
regard to the acceptance of material.
Fisher advises. Not only will the razzes
of those winning the prizes be pub
lished, but the 1922 Quad will include
the best contributions of all other com
petitors. A varied Razz Section is
planned for tly: forthcoming year-book,
and the editor is seeking material treat
ing everything from the historic "Count"
to the Peninsular Railway Company.
As has been previously announced, the
prizes will consist of two leather-bound
1 volumes of the 1922 Quad ,one to be
awarded to the best series of cartoons
razzing the living groups of the campus,
the second to be given to the best indi
vidual razz in the form of cither verse,
prose, or caTtoon. While cartoons arc
particularly desired. Fisher states, verse
or prose razzes are welcome and will
receive the same consideration as the
work of the artists. To date it happens
that most of the contributions have been
cartoons, and the Quad is anxious that
verse or prose razzes be contributed in
the near future.
