# BABE FIVE TO PLAY BERKELEY HIGH HERE TOMORROW NIGHT, 7:30
## 
### 
Tomorrow night at 7:30 the freshman
quintet will tangle with the five from
Berkeley High School. Berkeley High
has a speedy team this season and they
arc expected to give the Bahes a good
run for their money. They recently held
tlic California freshmen to a 19-13 score.
Captain Jansen will be in the game
tomorrow night and will he ready to
give the T'erkelcvites a good fight. Jan
sen has been out of the last two games
because of a sprained ankle, but is now
able to resume plav. Tt has been through
his consistent basket-shooting that the
have been able to run up such
high scores.
After the game tomorrow night the
dopesters may have some real stuff to
work on in grading the two Babe teams.
The Californians have the edge so far
in the favoritism of the city fans, but
some of the men who have seen the
local freshmen work say that if they
overcome the raggedness that charac
terizes certain parts of their play they
have a good chance against the Northern
youngsters.
What the Babes have lacked so far has
been real competition to test out their
strength. They have had so many games
with easy teams that tliev have become
overconfident, and when they get up for
a minute against some trained teamwork
they do not show too well. With the
first string lineup unbroken tomorrow
night they ought to put up a better
game than has featured their playing in
the last two contests.
