# STANFORD MUST NOT FAIL
## 
### 
Stanford students have been asked to give to many worthy causes,
but never has their aid been sought for a cause that affects them so
vitally and comes within their understanding so closely as the campaign
to raise funds for the university students of Europe. The conditions
depicted by the speakers at the assembly this morning strike such a
marked contrast between the environment under which the American
college student exists and the pitiful, struggling atmosphere under which
the European student labors that, Stanford men and women were faced
with the realization of what they might have had to undergo to obtain
the education that they are getting so easily now. The question that
arises is whether the ordinary Stanford student would submit to such
hardships in pursuit of learning, and whether they will give freely
to the aid of those who are willing to accept such hardship and trials
that they may become the future educated men and leaders of Europe.
Mr. Hoover has made this appeal to the University students of Amer
ica in the iaope that they would understand and appreciate something
of what their fellow-seekers are undergoing in Europe. He has not
asked the universities to contribute to the other funds because he thinks
that if they arise to the occasion in this instance they will be doing their
share.
Most of the American Universities have responded promptly to
Mr. Hoover's appeal, and some of them have fallen far below their
quota. Mr. Hoover is especially anxious that Stanford will give with
out reserve to this cause, and Stanford must not fail.
From three to ten dollars is asked from each student. Tt will take
a little self-sacrificing 011 the part of every Stanford man and woman
to pay this sum. It will be a greater burden on some than on others,
but three dollars' worth of sacrifice is not too much for any student to
bear in this cause that Stanford's greatest alumnus is sponsoring.
