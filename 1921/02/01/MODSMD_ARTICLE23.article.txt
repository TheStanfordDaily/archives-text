# FRATERNITIES MAY NOW BID MEN INFORMALLY
## 
### 
Second bidding date for freshmen en
tering this quarter was disposed of at a
meeting of the Interfraternity Confer
ence last evening. New men may be bid
informally from now on. The action
was taken by common consent because
of the fact that there is no need this
quarter of the second date.
Under the Conference regulations,
rushing of men undecided at the first
formal bidding begins at 6 o'clock on
that day and continues until 6 o'clock
the following Wednesday, when the
men may be pledged. ,
â€¢ It was also announced at the meeting
that freshmen pledged Sunday may move
to their respective houses immediately
upon receiving authorization from the
office of the dean of men.
