cific Coast Conference Association, vice
president of the National "Collegiate
Conference, and president of the West
ern District of the National Physical

whom is intrusted the future of ath
etics at Stanford. As a student at
Springfield College in Massachusetts he
earned a place among the chosen ranks
as a four-star athlete. Here he won hit*
block letter in football, baseball, basket
ball and track, and won minor letters in
ice hockey and gymnastics.
Upon graduation from Springfield
College in 1902, Dr. Browne took two
years of academic work at the Univer
sity of North Carolina and followed

cine. He coached the football and track
teams while a student in the medical
school, turning out winning teams.

a very successful term at Newton, lie
was called to Miami University and re
mained there as medical and physical
director for three years. Under his
coaching the Miami track and basket
ball teams made a very enviable record.
From Miami Dr. Browne was induced
to come to the coast and take the posi
tion of director of physical education
at Oregon Agricultural College. Close
attention to the needs of that institution
followed by a complete reorganization
of the department was in large measure

j responsible for the Aggie College com
ing to the front as a power in athletics
jof the coast. His system of intramural
! athletics instituted was the most promi
| nent feature at O. A. C. and served to
attract many for its benefits.
At the University of California Dr.
Browne served as director of physical
education during the summer session
and instructed on the faculty for two
summer quarters. He was commissioned
to the rank of captain in the Medical
Corps and later transferred to the same
position in the reserves. His work in the
graduate schools of medicine at Harvard
and Michigan for three years in spe
cialized medicine has ably fitted him for
the task of curing the most harmful
athletic troubles in their infancy.
Since his appointment to the position
of director of physical education at
Stanford. Dr. Browne has held the office
of president of the Coast Conference
Association. He was a member of the
nominating rules committee of the last
National Collegiate Conference, and was
elected to the vice-presidency and to
membership on the track rules commit
tee. Dr. Browne is now also vice-presi
dent of the Coast Conference Associa
tion. and president of the Western Dis
trict of the National Physical Educa
tion Association.
His system of intramural athletics,
now firmly established at Stanford, has
served to bring to light some of the
best available material for teams. Every
branch of sport is booming and the
future of the Cardinal in athletics is as
sured. The present facilities at Enciha
Gym are used to the limit and every bit
of the available space offered by the
new pavilion is needed to accommodate
the demands for athletic attainment
offered through the intramural system.
Dr. Browne is a member of Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity; Phi Chi, an honorary
medical fraternity, and Zeta Phi Med
ical Order.

president of the National "Collegiate
Conference, and president of the West
ern District of the National Physical

whom is intrusted the future of ath
etics at Stanford. As a student at
Springfield College in Massachusetts he
earned a place among the chosen ranks
as a four-star athlete. Here he won hit*
block letter in football, baseball, basket
ball and track, and won minor letters in
ice hockey and gymnastics.
Upon graduation from Springfield
College in 1902, Dr. Browne took two
years of academic work at the Univer
sity of North Carolina and followed

cine. He coached the football and track
teams while a student in the medical
school, turning out winning teams.

the ground floor. At the expiration of
a very successful term at Newton, lie
was called to Miami University and re
mained there as medical and physical
director for three years. Under his
coaching the Miami track and basket
ball teams made a very enviable record.
From Miami Dr. Browne was induced
to come to the coast and take the posi
tion of director of physical education
at Oregon Agricultural College. Close
attention to the needs of that institution
followed by a complete reorganization
of the department was in large measure

j responsible for the Aggie College com
ing to the front as a power in athletics
jof the coast. His system of intramural
! athletics instituted was the most promi
| nent feature at O. A. C. and served to
attract many for its benefits.

the task of curing the most harmful
athletic troubles in their infancy.

of director of physical education at
Stanford. Dr. Browne has held the office
of president of the Coast Conference
Association. He was a member of the

dent of the Coast Conference Associa
tion. and president of the Western Dis
trict of the National Physical Educa
tion Association.
His system of intramural athletics,
now firmly established at Stanford, has
served to bring to light some of the
best available material for teams. Every
branch of sport is booming and the
future of the Cardinal in athletics is as
sured. The present facilities at Enciha
Gym are used to the limit and every bit
of the available space offered by the
new pavilion is needed to accommodate
the demands for athletic attainment
offered through the intramural system.
Dr. Browne is a member of Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity; Phi Chi, an honorary
medical fraternity, and Zeta Phi Med
