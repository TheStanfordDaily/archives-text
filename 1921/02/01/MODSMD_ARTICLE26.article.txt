Editor The Daily Palo Alto:
There has been some misunderstand
ing among the faculty and students as
to Major Collins' motive in teaching the
art of equitation to the women students.
Major Collins has offered this course
out of his own good will in hi- belief
in the benefits the women will derive
from it, and is not being recompensed
by the University for the extra time it
takes to give this instruction.
It is the wish of the women taking
this course to thank Major Collins
through the columns of this paper for
his courtesy and patience, and to assure
him that the course highly appre
ciated. It may be added that this course
is a big addition to the Roble Gym
nasium department and has helped to
round Out the already extensive instruc
tion offered there.
