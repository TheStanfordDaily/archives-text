Among the recent hooks on the Far
East one should prove of special in
terest to the general reader as well
as to the special student. In "Amer
ica's Aims and Asia's Aspirations"
we have the attempt of a skillful
journalist Patrick Gallagher, to trace
one thread through the tangled skein
of the Peace Conference. The author,
who was long engaged in newspaper
work in the Philippines, represented
the New York Herald at Paris. While
trying to cover all the activities of
the Conference he was especially in
terested in those matters which con
cerned Asia. So although he gives
many interesting character sketches
and throws some light on many sub
jects, his book is.concerned primarily
with the work of the representatives
of Japan and China and of our own
delegates. We have here the fullest
account of the effort of China to se
cure the direct restriction of Kiao
chow, as well as the persistent at
tempt of Japan to secure the incor
poration of a racial equality clause
in the Covenant of the League of Na
tions. Sympathizing keenly with the
I Chinese, Mr. Gallagher shows clearly
j that the Big Three could not have
1 decided the Shantung question other
wise than as they did. Sentiment
favored China, but once again the peo
ple had to pay the price for the in
competence and corruption of their
officials. Happily a relief from this
situation lies in their own hands, if
they will but use it.
