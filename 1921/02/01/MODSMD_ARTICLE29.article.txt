It comes to us from good authority
that Redwood dancehall owners were
pained at the absence of certain
Stanford celebrities 011 the night of
January 2S. The S. A. E. struggle
must be quite some attraction.
* * *
A "Frisco" paper, in describing a
basketball team, refers to it as a
"first-string quintet." What were the
sport writers thinking about, a Ha
waiian orchestra?
* * »
That hip pocket ban proposed in the
state legislature must be contagious.
Somebody's trying to put it through
(or past) Congress now. What pock
\ ets will be allowed us when the anti
j cigarette league gets in its licks?
* * *
A fellow who came from Quebec:
Bumped off in a terrible wrec
He went nicely timber
When a hundred-pound timber
Fell down on the back of his nec.
* * *
SIMON AND THE FARE
Simple Simon met a sly one
And made a simple sally.
Said Simple Simon to the sly one
"What's the fare to Pally?"
Said the sly one to Simple Simon,
Because he didn't ken,
"The fare to Pally is six cents,
"But they want to make it ten."

Even the city papers are writing
feature stories on co-eds and powder

traction on our street car tracks that
causes them, the former, to attend to
the latter.

Since the sororities are no longer
classed as living groups, we should
be able to remark without fear of
contradiction that the mythical Neme

got. in a few good licks. Purely spe
-1 culative argument, of coarse.
* * *
Our band 1 must be getting ambitious,
judging by the way certain members
of it blow their,!instruments in two.
They ought to take a few lessons in
\ aero-dynamics.

And now cometh*the "Little Three."
Seeuis that every alliance must have

EACH GUEST WILL BRING A
