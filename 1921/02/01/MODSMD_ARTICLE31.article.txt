# CARDINAL TRACK PROSPECTS LOOK BRIGHT FOR THE COMING SEASON
## 
### 
Stanford track prospects seem es
pecially bright for the coming season.
Most of the members of last year's
varsity are out for places again this
season and nearly all the point-winners
of the freshman team have reported
for practice.
Captain Kirksey is naturally the
strongest man in the sprints. He can
be counted on for two first places in
any meet. Foster of fast year's fresh
man team and Bumbaugh, a transfer
from Oregon, seem likely men for
second and third places. Some other
men are showing up as possible dark
horses but as yet no meets have been
held to really determine their ability.
Wells is the outstanding man in the
hurdles. He is sure to break the tape
in every low hurdle race he starts
and there are very few men who can
beat him in the high sticks. King of
last year's varsity and Williams will
probably be the other Stanford men
in these events.
The quarter and half miles are pro
bably Stanford's weakest events on
the track. Wright and Hertel of last
year's squad are both good' for 51 se
conds in the quarter. Carlsmith and
Williamson loom up as the best bets
in the half. Carlsmith ran a good
race in the big meet last year but
failed to place. Williamson won the
freshman half mile. There is some
chance that Elliott may run the half
instead of the two-mile.
Elliott is the best miler that has
worn the Cardinal jersey for many
years. He won both the mile and the
two-mile in the freshman meet last
year, breaking the freshman mile re
cord. His showing in the P. A. A. was
also very creditable. He placed a
put and hammer and leads the field
California and Forward of the Olympic
Club. Eddleman will support him in
the two mile. He placed third in that
event against California last season.
Green and Wilcox are both 12 foot 6
men in the pole vault and should cap
ture the first two places in practically
all the meets. Green will also be in
action in the high jump and the dis
cus.
Green, Heath, and Weaver were all
consistent last season in clearing the
bar over six feet, and are all out for
practice. This event has been greatly
strenghtened by the return of Dykes.
The broad jump presents the great
est problem to Coach Templeton, as
practically all the men out are new
and have had very little experience.
Minsky, a transfer from Southern Cali
fornia has been showing up fairly
well. J. L. Russell, '21, has never com
peted before but has done 21 feet in
practice this early in the season and
looms up a possible first-place man.
Adams is the best man in the shot
put and Hanner leads the field
of javelin hurlers. The discus will
he hurled by Green, Kirksey and by
Sampsoil.
