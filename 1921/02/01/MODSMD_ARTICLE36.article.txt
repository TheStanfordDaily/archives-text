The first game in the intramural soc

default. Team A, a combination from
several fraternities, failed to show up.
A pick-up game was played, and the
hastily assembled team, made up mostly
of varsity men, beat the Redwood men
5 to 0.
Todd, captain of the Big Tree eleven,
drew much approbation by hi**brilliant
playing. The other men on the Sequoia
team are Brazil, Snow, Templeton, B.
Wilbur, B. C. Wilbur, Smith, Senior,
Law, Ridge, and Willard.
