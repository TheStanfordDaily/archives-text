## 
### 
In keeping with the program for
improving the general appearance and
attraction of the Lagunita, it is now I
planned to move the old bandstand
from the site of the new Stanford :
Commons to the shores of the lake. ■
This will not be done until later in ,
the year when the ground is dry.
According tjo present plans, which
are not final, the stand will be located
near the Women's Boathouse on the i
southeast side of the lake, facing the
hill leading to the President's home.
The pines and lake will form a
background and an outdoor amphi
theater can be made of the hill which
I runs down toward the water. Band
concerts and entertainments of other
kinds can be held here during the
spring and summer months.
In order to move the stand to the
proposed site, it will be necessary to
take the stand across the field below
Dr. Wilbur's home and back from «the
county road. This work cannot be
done during the wet weather. The
structure has been moved out of the
way of the new building and will re
main there until the wet weather is
•over. • f l ' ' i —*!"
