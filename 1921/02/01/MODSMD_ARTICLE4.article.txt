# BUBBLING BOHEMIA IS TITLE GIVEN RAM'S HEAD SHOW
## Charlie Arnn, Dan Evans Are Musical Comedy Authors; Clever Songs Are Featured 
### 
Ram's Head Socfety has given its
musical extravaganza a name which
•suggests nameless thrills and sur
prises. This name is "Bubbling Bo
hemia." The plot winds around wine,
women and song, and is flavored with
touching bits of sentimentality that
will bring the audience to tears —of
laughter. The authors of this bit of
cleverness are Charlie Arnn,' *20, and
Dan Evans, '20. Arnn is a member
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity but
is now living in Menlo Park with his
wife. He dabbled a bit in last year's
Ram's Head Show, writing a few lyr
ics, but this is the first time he has
made such a big attempt. Evans is
a member of Encina Club and is an
exceedingly clever writer of lyrics.
This is also his first attempt as an
author and both he and Arnn have
succeeded admirably.
There are a raft of clever song hits
written by campus t)alent. Among
these are songs by Myron Higby and
Milton Roberts, both well known on
the campus for previous successes in
both Ram's Head and Junior Opera
scores. ..*!*>,» j
Richard Malaby, '23. has also offered
some clever songs. Malaby transfer
red to Stanford in the fall and had
the part of the sentimental poet in
the Sophomcve Play, but this is the
first time he has offered any compo
sitions.
The chorus is doing some good
work and is showing up individual
start. Two of the ladies' beauty
chorus that have shown up especially
well in the art of mimicing the graces
of the fair sex are Bert Hard, '23. and
Bob Wilson, '23. They lead the chorus
es and certainly their grace would be
an inspiration to any poet. Spring,
Grecian and Indian War Dances
are not too much for this ingenious
chorus to attempt and to put over.
The campus is not going to be dis
appointed in expecting a great deal
of the musical comedy which will be
put on in the Assembly Hall on Fri
day evening, February 11.
