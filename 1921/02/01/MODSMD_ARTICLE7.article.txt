# STUDENTS ESTABLISH NEW BUS COMPANY TO COMPETE WITH TAXIS
## 
### 
No more shall exorbitant rates be
extorted from Stanford Students for
transportation to Palo Alto, accord
ing to the avowal of W. A. Henry
and Hugh Martin. These loyal Stan
ford men have come to the rescue of
campus queeners by establishing a
bus company to compete with the
Palo Alto taxi companies.
Beginning tomorrow night Henry
and Martin will operate a big bus
from the Women's Club House in
Palo Alto to the campus. The fare
will be fifty cent.' a couple, just half
the price charged by the taxi lines.
