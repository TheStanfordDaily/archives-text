When May Students
Buy Jewelry ?
For the best answer to the above question
this firm will award a cash prize of $25.
Second and third prizes of $15 to $10
respectively will be awarded.
Contest is open to any student, regularly enrolled
at Stanford.
Essays should not be longer than 200 words.
Awards will be made by a committee from the
Stanford faculty, or by a committee of advertis
ing managers of San Francisco Firms.
Contest closes February 28, 1921, and only one
paper may be submitted by an individual.
There are no fees or restrictions of any kind.
Winners of prizes must consent to the publication
of their essays in the Daily Palo Alto.
The object of this contest is first, of course, to gain
the attention of the students to this firmâ€”for ad
vertising this business. We do not, however, de
sire that the essays be written with a view to
furthering the jewelry business or the business of
this firm. We want a straightforward answer to
the question, regardless of our interests.
We want this information as a guide to our efforts
in advertising jewelry to Stanford students. If
there are limitations, set by good taste, on the
purchase of jewelry by students we want to know
it. If jewelry may be purchased by students, with
propriety, to a greater extent than is generally rec
ognized we want to know that. What articles of
jewelry may they properly buy and when is the
occasion appropriate?
Write your paper with these thoughts in mind and
mail it to the undersigned.
