Shoes
I Let's meet the readjustment conditions fairly and
squarely. The uncertainty of the last six months now
seems to have settled to a stabilized level. Consumer,
retailer and manufacturer can now make purchases
Iwith assurance and confidence.
The proof of the foregoing is found in our present
prices. Men's Walk-Over shoes that were retailing
at $16 and $18 some months ago are now marked
$10 and $12.50. Last July women's high lace shoes
wholesaled to the shoe merchant so as to justify a price
of $16 and $18. Today we are able to sell the same
shoes for $10 and $12.50, showing a drop of about
25 per cent.
The lower price level means larger business and
larger business is the foundation of expansion, develop
ment and Prosperity. Buy now!
