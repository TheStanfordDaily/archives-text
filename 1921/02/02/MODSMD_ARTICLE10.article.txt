### 
M;iy Peterson, the charming and popu
lar prima donna of the Metropolitan
Opera Company, will he the next con
cert artist to appear in the Peninsula
Musical Association series. This will be
the third attraction of the Peninsula
season, and will be given in the Assem
bly Hall on Thursday evening, Febru
ary 10.
Miss Peterson is considered an artist
of great personal power and magnetism,
and that she has been re-engaged for
her fourth consecutive season as prima
donna of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany is in itself a high tribute to her
artistry. In the past few years she has
become one of the most popular con
cert stars now before the public, and
she is invariably greeted with crowded
houses wherever she appears. For the
coming season she has been engaged for
seventeen return engagements on the
Pacific Coast. Miss Peterson has long
been a special favorite with colleges and
universities throughout the country, and
during the past season gave thirty-one
concerts in leading educational institu
tions.
Assurance is given of the enjoyment
to be derived from a program given by
Miss Peterson. It contains all the va
riety necessary for both an artistic and
popular success. There is always found
in her selections a number of delightful
old melodies, known from childhood
days, and Miss Peterson is noted for her
ability in interpreting them.

ruary 5. beginning at 8 o'clock. No more
