# Coach Maloney Enters Second Childhood By Contracting the Mumps
## 
### 
Ihe startling statement that Coach
Harry Maloney has entered his second
childhood came yesterday from no less
an authority than Dr. A. D. Browne.
Browne ought to know. He examined
Maloney and pronounced the verdict
that the rugby coach has fallen into that
well-known "error" of youth—Hirting
with mumps.
Browne ordered Maloney into seclu
sion for two weeks, and now has to
face the clamor of a mob of athletes and
near-athletes who apparently cannot sur
vive without the personal supervision
usually given by Maloney to their con
tests. Intramural boxers are demanding
the importation of a "foreign" referee
to conduct their bouts in Maloney's
place. Varsity, freshmen and intramural
soccer and rugby enthusiasts stream in
and out of the Gym office gnashing their
teeth over the loss of their "Harry."
"Nobody realized before how much the
life of this Gym depended on that man,"
asserted C. S. Botsford, after chasing
a gang of fencing maniacs out of the
office.
