# FRESHMAN FIVE WILL PLAY BERKELEY TONIGHT
## Strong High School Team to Tangle With Babes; Close Fight Expected at Encina 
### 
The freshman quintet tangles to
night with the Berkeley High School
team. The game is scheduled for 7:30
as there will be no varsity contest.
Last night under Captain Jansen the
babes held a light signal practice to
get into top shape for the struggle
I tonight. The second squad scrim
maged against the varsity in the aft
ernoon and all the players worked
except those who will probably start
the game tonight.
The northern five boasts a strong
combination, and as it held the Cali
fornia cubs to a low score last week,
comes here with a good record behind
it. The other teams from across the
! bay have not showed too much class
but tonight promises to be one of the
best games before the big contest be
tween the universities.
Captain Jansen will lead his team
again tonight after his forced lay-up
due to a sprained ankle. Lastj night
he was working in good shape and
ought to last tonight without any
trouble. McHosq will hold one of the
forwards with either Alabaster or
Granger for mate. The two guard po-
I sitions will probably start with At-
I will and Smith.
