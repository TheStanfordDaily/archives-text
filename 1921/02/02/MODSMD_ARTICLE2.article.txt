# AMERICAN SYMPATHY NEEDED BY SPANISH SAYS DR. BELAUNDE
## 
### 
North Amcrica must not believe that
South America is condemned to revo
lution, but rather that it is side by side
with Anglo-Saxon ideals, and should
view it with sympathy. These conclud
ing words of Dr. Victor Andres Be
launde, professor at the University of
San Marcos, Lima, Peru, in his lecture
at the Little Theater last night, give
with striking emphasis the viewpoint of
the illustrious South American.
The argument of Dr. Belaunde all the
way through his lecture was to get North
Americans to look with sympathy upon
South American spiritual development
and not to view it as a field merely of
economic exploitation. Spanish-America
is anxious to know and to understand
our ideals and we should be correspond
ingly anxious to know theirs, according
to the eminent professor.
The sudden change after the wars of
independence came so quickly that it is
only now that conditions are beginning
to be adjusted, and that the people are
making some preparation for self
government. The sons of these lighters
f*>r independence are just beginning to
attain the ideals their fathers strove for.
It is a struggle for democratic untiy
against geographical conditions and the
traditions of the country.
"America," said Dr. Belaunde, "has
outstripped Europe in international jus
tice and the evolution of democracy."
Unity is the rule in North America, but
in Spanish-America diversity-is the rule,
but there is spiritual unity.
Dr. Belaunde also lectured this morn
ing in the Little Theater at 9 o'clock to
Professor Percy Martin's class in South
American history.
