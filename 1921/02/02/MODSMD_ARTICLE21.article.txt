# FOR THE GOOD OF BASEBALL

### 
lii an effort to raise the level of college baseball and make it the
clean and wholesome sport that it should be. a committee of the Natiofial
Intercollegiate Athletic Association has made recommendations concern
ing the conduct of the men on the playing fold and' from the sidelines.
The report suggests that the constant abuse of the pitcher by the coach
ers be eliminated and all remarks from the bench be absolutely prohib
ited. This is a common practice with the professional teams and is fol
lowed more or less by some of the college teams. There is no doubt
that sarcastic and abusive remarks made by the coachers detract from
the game from the viewpoint of the average crowd of college specta
tors, who generally have a feeling of sportsmanship ingrained in them 1 .
At times the "line of talk" that the coachers utter is humorous and
adds to the interest in the game, but it takes a skilled coacher to do this
and keep from stepping over the line of decency. The average college
coacher does not know how" to get funny remarks across, and in the
majority of cases, he merely annoys the spectators, and sometimes pro
vokes ill feeling 011 the opposite team.
The committee also recommends that the catcher be prohibited
from talking to the batsman. This is an old trick used by professional
players to distract the batter, and can hardly be called good' sports
manship.
The recommendations named above are good ones, and they should
be followed rigidly by college teams if they are interested in making
baseball a typical college sport, where the highest ideals of fairness can
be exhibited. However, there is a danger of taking some of the "pep"
and spirit out of college baseball, if the committee's recommendation re
garding remarks of encouragement that the men on the team in the
field make to keep their own interest alive and to help the pitcher along,
is adopted. These remarks are not of an abusive nature, and they serve
to keep the interest of the spectators alive also.
College baseball can be made a much better sport than it is on the
Western Coast if the players will seek to better it by their own efforts.
Here at Stanford, baseball has been given a big impetus by the announce
ment of the trip to the Far East this summer, and the next few years
should sec the Cardinal turning out teams that will be known all over
the country for the sportsmanship and skill of the men.
