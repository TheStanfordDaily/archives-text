# NEWS FOR THE QUEENERS
## 
### 
The announcement of the new bus line that will operate between
the Woman's Clubhouse in Palo Alto and the campus after the Wednes
day night dances should give considerable satisfaction to the queeners.-
The management of the new concern will cut the present taxi rate in
half, which will be a big saving to those who are forced to pay an even
dollar every Wednesday for transportation. Anything that will lower
the cost of queening should meet with the approcal of the students, and
they should give the new bus company the entire campus trade.
