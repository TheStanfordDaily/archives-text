# DAVID HENRY GRAY HAS EARNED MANY TITLES
## 
### 
The varied career of Professor David
Henry Gray has earned for him aÂ£ once
the titles of dramatist, poqt, philan
thropist, dramatic critic and, last hut
not least, professor of English, in which
capacity he now serves at Stanford.
The fact that Stanford was preferred
to the positions offered him by Columbia
and Harvard at the same time makes
one realize the virtual honor bestowed
on the university to have such a man in
its faculty.
As dramatist and dramatic critic, he
has been interested in everything from
Shakespeare to the art of the movies.
He has written numerous articles for
technical journals emphasizing the
method of dramatorgic criticism. This
unique point of view, in that it is a dis
tinct separation from the set methods
of modern times, has caused many dis
cussions, one of which was recently
published in the London Times. These
philological articles are being com
pounded into book form and have won
for the author the Doctor of Literature,
which he received last commencement.
As a writer of dramas, Professor
Gray has had three of his works pro
duced, together with some adaptations
from French and German. He is at
present at work on a book on the Mod
ern Drama. From boyhood the drama
lias proved to be a subject of absorbing
interest for him. The very human ten
dency which permeates all of his works
was first brought forth in "The 1 emp
est," a play written while still in gram
mar school. Here the lad carried out
Shakespeare's "Tempest" in the light of

a boy's stomach after too much "Sun
day dinner." The delightful humor in
this is characteristic of what appeal in
his productions.
David Henry Gray's career as a poet
began when, as a young man, he de
sired a real banquet which the book
reviews could not afford him. Then he
would write a poem which bought for
him not only one banquet, but many.
His last contribution in this line was on
the occasion of the seventieth birthday
of David Starr Jordan. As a member
of Phi Beta Kappa lie was the poet of
the fraternity a few years ago.
Believing at one time that his life
was to be one similar to that of Jacob
A. Rees, lie worked for two and one-half
years doing social service work in the
slums of New York. He finally recog
nized the impossibility of such a career,
and we now find a slight vestige of this
tendency in his appointment to the Na
tional Board of Review in connection
with the betterment of the motion pic
ture. He is the only member outside of
New York, and is also a member of the
National Committee for Better I ilms.
As president of the California Associa
tion Committees for Better Minis, his
aim is to make films clean without tak
ing the "joy out of life."
Professor Gray received his Ph. B. at
Colgate in 1897 and his A. M. at Colum
bia in 1898, his Ph. D. also in 1904. He
was assistant in German and French at
Colgate Academy, 1896-97, and taught
in the summer sessions in Columbia and
the University of Texas, respectively.
He has been at Stanford since 1905.
