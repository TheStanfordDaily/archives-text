# MANY INTERESTING FEATURES PLANNED FOR NEW PAVILION
## 
### 
Plans for Stanford's new basketball
pavilion to be constructed near the
site of the present Gym, are nearly
complete and construction will soon
be under way. The building is to be
constructed to match the library with
the same brick and re-enforced con
crete exterior. Practically the whole
end of the building will be lighted
by a solid facing of windows to re
semble those of the library. Ventila
tion will also be had from the top of
the side walls by means of the same
window arrangement.
The floor space which is consider
ably larger than offered by the gym
nasium now in use will cover an area
of 108 by 150 1 square feet. On enter
ing the building from the front which
is to face Encina, there will be a spa
cious men's cloak room. The women's
dressing rooms and rest rooms will
be found on the left wing of the main
lobby and will be large and comfort
able.
At the west end of the building, a
kitchen with a service counter at
tached, will open into the main pa
vilion. Another feature In this res
pect will be a separate room for the
chaperons opening into the main por
tion through arches. This room should
serve as an attraction for the spon
sors of the dance for it is to be steam
beared and artistically furnished.
A serie? of handball courts will be
placed pri the side of the buliding
facing Encina Gym. This fact is of
special interest to the large group
of enthusiasts of that sport as their
facilities in the past have been
limited.
It is the plan of the contractor to
have the building completed, in time
for the senior Prom which will be held
the last week of the Spring quarter.
The value of the additional basket
ball floor space offered by the new
pavilion will be incalculable in the
development of future basketball
teams. The present floor is much too
small to meet the demands on it and
due to its being constructed on a
solid cement base. The new floor
will be a springy affair and will reduce
the number of injuries caused by the
solid floor.
A definite plan has been formulated
to finance the pavilion. The univer
sity is to contribute $5,000 per year,
$2,500 will be contributed annually
from the president's budget, $2,500
will be taken from the comptroller's
budget and three dollars a year is to
be paid from students' registration
fees.
