# Newspapers In This Vicinity Announce Increase In Rates
## 
### 
Practically all newspapers in the bay
and peninsula cities announced a raise
in rates which took effect yesterday.
The San Francisco morning papers in
creased their subscription price 25 cents
a month, while the evening papers raised
20 cents. A raise was also announced by
the Oakland and San Jose papers, and
similar action was taken by the Palo
Alto Times recently.
The increasing cost of paper and labor
have been given as the reasons for the
raise. It is said that the cost of white
paper in a single issue exceeds the price
at which it is sold. Attempts have been
made to get cheaper newsprint. Appeals
have even been made to Washington,
but they have been of no avail.
