# SYNCOPATED ORCHESTRA TO PLAY HERE SATURDAY
## Company of Instrumentalists and Vocalists Will Return To Campus For Concert 
### 
Under the management of Frank W.
Healy, the American Syncopated Or
chestra and Singers, who played here
last year, will return to the campus for
a concert, which will be given in the
Assembly Hall next Saturday night.
The company is made up of thirty
talented instrumentalists and vocalists,
who have been giving a series of con
certs on the Coast. Every form of jazz
music will be included in the repertoire,
and the orchestra is considered one of
the world's greatest exponents of the
melodies of the American negroâ€”music
which is a truly American product of a
race whose whole soul is harmony and
rhythm. In a tour of the South and
West, these thirty musicians, with two
vocal quartets and two'vocal soloists,
have been making American music loved
universally.
The American negro is known as a
musician of surpassing ability, a singer
whose tones have a distinct charm of
their own, and a composer of an entirely
different kind of music which ranks, in
its own way, with the compositions of
the greatest of the European masters.
Syncopation will be the keynote of the
program Saturday night, and the music
played will be the kind peculiar to the
emotional temperament of the negro.
But besides the variety of popular
syncopated music, the musicians will in
terpret a number of classics, and the
program will contain not only many
examples of jazz, pure and simple, but
will include a variety of negro spirituals,
folk songs, camp-meeting tunes, and a
number of ballads.
Tickets for the concert will be priced
at $1.50 for the first twelve rows, and all
other seats will be $1. They are now on
sale at Crandall's in Palo Alto and at
the box office in the Administration
Building.
