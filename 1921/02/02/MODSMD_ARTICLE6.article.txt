# REDWOOD TEAMS ARE DEFEATED IN GAMES WITH CAMPUS FIVES
## 
### 
Both the Stanford 135-pound team
and the Fremont Post, American Legi
on five were victorious over the Red
wood Post 135-pound and "unlimited"
quintets respectively, in last night's
games played at Fireman's Hall in
Redwood City. The 135-pound team
piled up a score of 46 to 6. The
Legion team, playing short halves,
was able to amass only 27 points to
their opponents' 2.
The team work of the light men
showed up to good advantage against
the green shirts, who were good indi
vidual players but lacked the co-ordi
nation necessary to get the ball into
their own end of the court. Several
times the Redshirts* team work scored
for them before the Legion men rea
lized that the ball was in play. Hogle.
Brazil and Hollingsworth accounted
for most of the midgets' scores. Po
lezky and Burnett filled the guard po
sitions so well that the Redwood for
wards got very few chances to show
their goal-shooting ability.
The "(Unlimited" game was equally
| one-sided. W. W. Young playing run
' ning guard, was the individual star
of the performance. Ho followed the
ball constantly, and repeatedly took
it away from the Redwood forwards,
i dribbled down the court and shot a
' basket. Young is coach of the 135-
i pound quintet. Arthur, White, Wilson
and Ayres were the other Legionaire
basketeers.
