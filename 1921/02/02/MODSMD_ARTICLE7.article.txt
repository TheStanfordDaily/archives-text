# CARDINAL FIVE PLAYS CATHOLIC TEAM TONIGHT
## Powell Will Take Nine Men to San Francisco to Meet the Fast St. Ignatius Quintet 
### 
Coach Powell will take the varsity
quintet to San Francisco tonight to
contest with the fast St. Ignatius five
in the last preliminary game of the
reason. Nine men will make the trip.
They are, Righter. Davies, Rogers,
Mills, Adams, Richmond, Esgen, An
derson, and Ralph Carver.
The St. Ignatius team is one of the
fastest around the bay and is made up
of several players who played with
the Olympic 145's here two weeks
ago. Gavin, Lauterwasser, and Boyle
who were all members of the club
team are attending the Catholic in
stitution.
Powell will start the usual line-up
against the San Franciscans. Righter
and Davies will play in the forward
positions with Rogers and Esgen as
relief men. Mills will hold forth at
center with Ralph Carver as his un
derstudy. Richmond at running guard
will be spelled by Anderson if a com
manding lead is secured early in the
game. Captain Freddie Adams will
take care of the Standing guard job.
Stanford should beat the Saints but
it will not be a walk-away. The Igna
tians are small and very fast and the
last light team that Stanford met, the
Olympic 145-pounders, held the Cardi
nal to a 39 to 34 score. Coach Powell
will be enabled to secure a line on
his team working on a strange court
and the team also should benefit by
their experience.
While the varsity is visiting the
freshman five will take on the quin
tet from Berkeley High School in- the
Encina Gymnasium.
