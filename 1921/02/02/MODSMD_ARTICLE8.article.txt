# HIGGENBOTTOM WILL SPEAKS TONIGHT ON PROBLEMS OF INDIA
## 
### 
India's help lies in agricultural edu
cation according to Samuel Higgen
bottom, who will speak at the Y. M.
C. A. World Problems Forum, in the
Little Theatre, at 7:30 tonight.
Higginbottom, who is principal of
the Agricultural Institute at Allaha
bad. director of agriculture to the
Gwalior government, and agrucultural
advisor to a number of the Mahara
jahs is well qualified to speak on the
problems of India through his close
contact with the inhabitants. He will
describe how he thinks conditions
there can be best improved and will
outline the achievements up to the
present time.
The Agricultural Institute of which
Higgenbottom is the head has a staff
composed of s ven Americans, three
of whom are in extension work, and
seven Indian Christian teachers and
assistants. The chief troubles which
he and his corps of workers have had
to combat are crushing poverty, illi
teracy, caste, and primitive methods.
These four things have been ob
stacles to India's progress for many
years and it is principally upon means
of alleviating them that Higgenbot
tom will base his lectures tonight.
Higgenbottom is making a tour of the
country and spoke at several southern
colleges on a similar subject recently.
