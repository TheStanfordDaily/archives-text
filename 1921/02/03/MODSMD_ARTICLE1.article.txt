# ALUMNI APPROVE BOARD PLAN FOR STADIUM FINANCE
## Answers to Circular Letter Favor Granting Privileges On Seats to Contributors 
### 
Alumni all over the country have
expressed themselves as being strong
ly in favor of the plan of financing
Stanford's football stadium by means
of ticket privileges in return for sub
scriptions. This reaction is the re
sult of a circular letter and card sent
out recently by the Board of Athletic
Control explaining the scheme and
asking for alumni sanction, disapprov
al or suggestions.
The cards returned to date, show
that 650 are solid for the board's plan
while 85 are opposed to it. Letters
have been received containing con
structive criticism and suggestions of
other ways to finance the project, but
the great majority have expressed the
opinion that the plan now being con
sidered will work out the best and
that they are willing to give their
support.
This plan provides that ticket pri
vileges for fifteen years will be given
in return for subscriptions to the sta
dium. A subscription of will
assure the subscriber the right to buy
two choice reserved seats for a period
of fifteen years at a price of four dol
lars a seat. For a subscription of
$200 the subscriber may have four
seats at four dollars apiece and so on
up to a point where an option can be
had on ten seats by a subscription of
$500. Larger subscriptions will be ap
preciated but the board does not con
sider it wise to allot seats to alumni
in larger blocks.
To those not subscribing and secur
ing the guaranteed right to purchase,
it has been proposed that the bast
seats will be sold for five dollars, and
that applications will have to be made
with no more assurance than has
been given in the past that the seats !
will be available.
As now being considered the stadi
um will be of the sunken type, prob
ably horseshoe in shape, large enough
to seat sixty thousand people at a
minimum, and containing a track with
a 220-yard straightaway through the
open end. It is estibated that the
cost of such a structure will be in
the neighborhood of $500,000. The
plans of the engineers-call for exca-<
vation in the spring or summer of
this year to the depth of approximate
ly twenty feet. The earth will be
banked arountj the excavation and
allowed to settle through two winter
seasons and then finished off with
concrete aeats in time for the Cali
fornia-Stanford game in 1923.
