# VARSITY TRIUMPHS OVER ST. IGNATIUS QUINTET IN FIRST OFF-CAMPUS GAME
## "SWEDE" RIGHTER PROVES TROUBLE MAKER FOR CATHOLIC TEAM; CONTRIBUTES EIGHT OUT OF SIXTEEN GOALS 
### 
The Cardinal basketball varsity in
vaded San Francisco last night and
administered a beating to the St. Ig
natius cage team. The score was 31
to 18. This was the first game thar
Stanford has played on a strange
court but the new landscape did not
deter them from putting on the usual
flashy exhibition of court work.
"Swede" Righter was a particular
ly bad actor against the Catholic ag
gregation. He contributed eight field
goals for a total of sixteen points, and
otherwise disported himself in a man
ner that aroused the jealousy of his
hosts.
Powell started the regular line-up
with Righter and Davies playing for
wards, Mills at center, Richmond at
running guard, and Captain Adams
in the standing guard position.

The members of the St. Ignatius
quintet were not strangers to the
wearers of the Stanford red. Larre
cou of the unlimited Olympic team
played running guard, and Boyle,
center on the 145-pound team, played
center. Garvin, Lauterwasser, and
Molkenbuhr were also in uniform.
The Varsity will rest until next
Monday when the University of Wash
ington comes here for a two game
series. These two games should be
fast for the reason that Washington
will try to dislodge Stanford from the
lead in the Pacific Coast Conference
series. California and /Washington
will play Friday and Saturday in Ber
keley and as each of these teams
have unblemished records in the Con
ference there will probably be a new
angle to the two games here next
week.
