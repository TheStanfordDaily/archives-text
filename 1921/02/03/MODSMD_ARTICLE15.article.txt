# Mumps Keep Maloney At Home; "Maniacs" Keep Him at Work
## 
### 
Not even the mumps and confinement
in his home on the orders of Dr. A. D.
Browne are enough to relieve Harry
Maloney from bis responsibilities in
guiding the athletic destinies of the
young army of sport enthusiasts who
storm Encina Gym every afternoon.
These "maniacs," as "Dink" Templcton
terms them, insistently demand the per
sonal attention of the physical training
mentor for their individual problems.
They keep the wire to Maloney's home
hot with their requests for instructions.
The one wire is hardly able to serve the
whole inquiring crowd, and the plan has
been suggested that another line to Ma
loney's house be installed so Mrs. Ma
loney can answer half the inquiries in
"rush" hours.
