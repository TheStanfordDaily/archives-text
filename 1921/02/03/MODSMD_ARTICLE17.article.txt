## 
### 
The Stanford English Club, together
with the Faculty English Department,
met Tuesday evening at 8:00 in the
Women's Clubhouse, for their semi
monthly meeting.
The feature of the evening was a
one-act. farce entitled "Caroline's
Christmas." This playlet constitutes
a most amusing and hilarious per
formance. It is the dramatization of
one of Leacock's "Nonsense Novels."
The cast was as follows:
Farmer f. William Huse
Farmer's Wife Genevieve Apgar
Son from Sing Sing R. Binckley
Son of Wall Street Archie Binns
Caroline Mollie Wlndlsh
With the sole exception of Binns,
the cast was composed of the club's
initiates; and their acting was a cre
dit to their society.
In addition to the play, there was a
musical program. Bernice Franken
heimer played several selections and
Darl Mac√üoyle sang his "Tommy
Land."
The evening's entertainment was
concluded with refreshments served
by a committee headed by Carroll
Alexander.
