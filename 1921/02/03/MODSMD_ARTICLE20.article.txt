In an address delivered to women of
the Young Women's Christian Associa
tion at the University of Oregon, Miss
Grace Edington, an instructor in Eng
lish, made the following statement:
"A pleasure which is being overdone
on the capus here, is the pleasure of
being engaged. It is no particular tribute
to a girl to be able to say that she has
been engaged to a number of men. You
know," she continued, "there is a differ
ence between being 'engaged' and being
'engaged to be married.'"
