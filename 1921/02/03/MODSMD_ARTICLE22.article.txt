# STADIUM PLANS

### 
Since the announcement of the plan to build a Stanford Football
Stadium Stanford students have heard nothing more of the matter, and
a good many have gained the idea that the plan has been side-tracked
and the idea dropped. This supposition is not true, as the announcement
in the news section today shows. The committee of the Board of Athletic
Control has been working quietly on the matter, and has been consider
ing every method possible to raise the money, and examining all feasible
plans as to the style and type of the proposed structure. That they have
gained results is evidenced by the number of replies received from alum
ni and the interest shown by Stanford men and women everywhere.
The replies from the alumni letters have enabled the committee to
determine the method for their financial campaign, and the drive will
be launched'soon. 1 he site has already been chosen, the type of stadium
to be built has been selected, and a definite time for beginning actual
work on the excavation has been decided upon. A formal ground-break
ing ceremony has been arranged to take place in a short time. The
progress that has been made is evident and puts the Stanford project
considerably ahead of the California stadium in a comparison of results
accomplished. The Stanford committee is alive and on the job and de
serves considerable credit for the progress made thus far.
