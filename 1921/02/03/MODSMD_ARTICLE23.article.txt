# Pershing and Prather Showing Progress In "Bubbling Bohemia"
## 
### 
. Rehearsals for "Bubbling Bohemia"
are showing good results. Dick Persh
ing and Ned Prather are doing particu
larly well. Pershing is an old veteran
at the dramatic game and knows many
tricks of the trade which he is using to
good advantage in the part of the news
paper reporter. One of the song hits of
the show will be sung by him, "Hoping,"
written by Myron Higby, '22. Prather,
though he started working on the show
at quite a recent date, is showing a keen
appreciation and understanding of his
part. Plays, recently, seem incomplete
without a vampire, and this time the
part is designated as the "Baby" vam
pire. This part falls to Prather,. and he
is entirely successful in his conception
of it.
S. H. Mendenhall lias what might be
called the ingenue role, that of a sweet,
innocent young girl, who tries, in bet
own simple way, to outdo the clever
vampire. However, both the innocent
girl and the vampire have keen competi
tion in Thomas Carskadon, who por
trays a coquettish old maid, and will
probably be the biggest comedy feature
of the play. Carskadon is exceedingly
clever and has a keen sense of humor
which enables him to make the most
of all the comedy stuff his part offers.
Coach Seib is very pleased with the
results he is getting and promises to
have a finished play for the campus.
