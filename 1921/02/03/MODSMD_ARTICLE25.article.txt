# SYNCOPATORS WILL APPEAR SATURDAY
## Program to Include Original Numbers, Negro Spirituals and Classical Selections 
### 
The American Syncopated Orchestra
and Singers, who will give a concert at
the Assembly Hall Saturday night, are
considered tiie world's greatest expon
ent sof all that the word syncopation
signifies. In the popular section of their
program they will endeavor to draw a
distinct line between "syncopation" and
"jazz," two terms much confused. Jazz
has been condemned as cacophony, while
syncopation skillfully done is an entirely
different product and something that
pleases those who understand it.
The program Saturday night will rep
resent the best of American negro
melodies. The orchestra will use a num
ber of old negro spirituals and folk
songs, as well as some original composi
tions by members o.f the orchestra and
some of the favorite classics.
The aggregation consists of thirty
musicians, some of them singers, but
mostly instrumentalists, and all chosen
musicians. Numbers which have been
particularly popular in their recent tour
of the Pacific Coast have been several
chorus selections, among them "Swing
Along," "Mammy o' Mine," and the
"Rain Song." The vocal quartet con
tains some unusually good voices, and
is composed of Laura Hall, soprano;
Marion Harris, contralto; William Cole
man, tenor; and William Hawkins,
basso.
Tickets for the performance may be
reserved at $1.50 for the first twelve
rows and $1 for all other seats. They
are now on sale at Crandall's in Palo
Alto and at the, box ofiice in the Admin
istration Building.
