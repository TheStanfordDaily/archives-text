The S. A. E. Again
The dance hall king of Redwood
j I lis hands upon his chin
Mused on a January night
| When his crowds were sparse and
thin.
The sounds of merry music-
Were wasted on the air,
There was no noise of shuffling feet,
No Stanford men were there
| "Hpw Come?" the dance-king won
dered
"Where can the roughnecks be?'
J — How could the Kedwou-cl u?.nce-king
know
They were at the S. A. E.
* ♦ »
The blue laws are named correctly
after all. The sky is the limit.
m * *
Yes, the Zionists plan a parade clown
Broadway, in the expectation that
they will be able to drive the evil be
fore them down the thoroughfare, and
hound it into the harbor. This busi
ness of casting the devil into the sea
may blight the 1921 fish crop.
+ * *
Of course, the lobsters will bite on
all the old gags, but the crabs will
always be with us, henrt and sounl.
* + *
A city paper headline says, "Ban
dits are shot in safe robbery." Does
not sound too safe to us.
# * *
The worst ingrate we ever heard of
was the sleuth who had the restaurant
proprietor pinched for putting brandy
sauce oi his birthday plum pudding.
Talk about biting the hand that's
putting out grub!
* * *
We wish some of the Sigma Nu's
representatives would have their
souls sent to the lower regions for a
little investigation. We didn't get
anything now from the "Heavenly
Gate" story.
* * •
Why didn't the Baron stop the soul
in its backward flight at the stage of
the anthropoid ape and look over some
of the boys' ancestors swinging from !
the cocoanut trees by the appendage
peculiar to such animals? That would
have been an interesting sidelight on
geneology and might put forth a mo
dern Hecateus.
* * #
We learn that Joe Murphy's men are
staging lively contests. Someone sug
gests that they're fighting unfairly.
Says it sounds like forbidden punch
ing.
