# UNDERCLASS WOMEN WIN FIRST GAME OF PRELIMINARY ROUND
## 
### 
The freshmen women's basketball
team defeated the senior seven by a
score of 16 to 3, in the first game of
the preliminary round of the inter
class series, Tuesday afternoon, on
the Roble courts. In spite of the
score the game was hard fought and
swift.
At the end of the first half the
score stood 6 to 1 in favor of the
freshmen. In the second half the un
derclass team piled up ten more points
and it was not until the last five min
utes of the play that the seniors made
their second goal, making a final of
16 to 3.
Sidney Hawkins made six of the
ten points for the freshmen in the
second half of the game and Helen
Lawrence threw four of the eight
baskets. Marion McElligott made the
remaining two points. Amelia Hed
ges made the first point for the seni
ors in the first half of the game and
Hester Proctor made the field throw
in the second half. Both Carol Elsey
and Muriel Pease playing in center,
starred for the seniors.
The second game of the series will
be played tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
between the junior and the sophomore
teams. Both teams have several of
last year's players back on the squads
and since both showed up well in the
last series the game promises to be
an interesting one.
