# SIGMA NU VICTORY MAKES RACE CLOSE IN SECOND LEAGUE
## 
### 
The cards are pretty well gummed-up
in the race for the title in League 2
of the intramural basketball schedule,
in consequence of the 5-3 victory of the
Sigma Nu out tit over the quintet repre
senting the Phi Gamma Delta house,
last night. The Fijis had a percentage
of 1000 until last night, when one bas
ket deprived them of the title, for the
present, and made it an even break be
tween them, the Sigma Nus and the
Theta Chi team, each with a percentage
of .800.
Arrangements will have to be made
for playing off the tie, as each of the
leaders in this league have lost one
game apiece; the Sigma Nus lost to the
Theta Cliis, the Theta Chis lost to the
Fijis, and last night the Fijis lost to the
Sigma Nus by the Score of 5 to 3.
The game was played on the large
floor at Encina and both teams, con
sidering this fact, did some good guard
ing, as the score indicates. Snooks and
Long tossed the baskets for the Sigma
Nus, two of the tallies being field goals,
and the odd number represents their
single free throw. Sibley rang up the
three points credited to the Phi Gamma
outfit with a field goal and one free
throw. Glenn, who played on the Fiji
five, also shot, but just too late.
The game was a neck-and-neck affair
all the way through, but both teams did
some erratic playing, otherwise a more
decisive score would have resulted.
Good-sized rooming sections were on
hand and a tight and exciting contest
rewarded their interest.
