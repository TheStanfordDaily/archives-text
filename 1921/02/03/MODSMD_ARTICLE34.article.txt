# Margaret Carlsmith, '22, Chosen Boating Manager
## 
### 
Margaret Carlsmith, '22, was elected
boating manager at a special meeting of
the Women's Athletic Association last
night. The duties of the new manager
will include the general supervision of
all lake sports. She will have power to
enforce the canoe rules and will have
charge of the women's boat house.
A new rule to replace the one now in
force by which nine consecutive practices
are necessary to make a player eligible
for a class team was enacted. The new
rule states that "No one shall play on a
team who has not been out for practice
with the team at least two weeks after
the beginning of practice." This rule
will become effective next quarter.
The board also acted to change the
time of the interclass basketball games
now in progress from 4:15 to 5 p. tn.
This change was made in order that
more rooters may attend tly? games.
This change will take effect beginning
next Tuesday.
