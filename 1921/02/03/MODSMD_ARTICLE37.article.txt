Miss Peterson is known as a finely
poised, all-around American girl, whose
practical side has not suffered by the
pursuit of an artistic career which has
brought her fame and recognition both
as a corfcert and as a grand opera star.
"I was a poor girl," Miss Peterson
said in a recent interview, "one of nine
children, and my father,' a Methodist
minister, died when 1 was but thirteen.
I had to struggle and sacrifice to get
my musical education."
The pursuit of her chosen career
meant facing many a rebuff and many
sleepless a lid despondent nights.
"It was a fight against ruthless fate
to get to Paris and study with Jean de
Reszke," Miss Peterson said. "I did that
when 1 was eighteen. It was a hardship
to sit up all night reading to a blind
old woman in Berlin in order to obtain
a little money, one mark, which would
buy my breakfast, dinner, and supper
the next day, thus allowing me to con
tinue my studies, it was a struggle, aqd
a grim one, to carry out my father's
teaching that I had a message in my
voice for the world."
The grim pictures of courage and
self-denial which Miss Peterson related,
a little $3-a-week room in the Latin
Quarter of Paris with its rented piano,
the struggle, almost hopeless at times,
to keep her soul alive and her body
clothed and nourished, the proud de
termination to win at all costs and carry
out her father's wish to give her voice
to gladden the world, only serve to
deeoen interest in the noted artist.
