## 
### 
"India's greatest need at the present
is for men and women to instruct lier
younger generation," said Samuel Hig
genbottom in a lecture in the Little
Theater last night.
Higgenbottom has spent sixteen years
in India and he is convinced that the
greatest hope for the country lies in
agricultural education.* Her aggregate
crops are very large, but the yield per
acre or per man is the smallest in the
world. "The difficulty has not been in
the land, because it is productive, but in
the poverty, the illiteracy, caste, and
primitive methods," said Higgenbottom.
Of the 700,000 villages in India, 500,-
000 have no teaching facilities, and
where there are schools few children of
the lower caste can attend because of
poverty. The average wage paid per day
is three to six cents.
In proving what can lie done for the
people of India by education, Higgen
bottom described the work done at the
Agricultural Institute at Allahabad, of
which he is the principal. The institute,
which has the co-operation of the In
dian princes and the British officials, is
engaged in training young Indians to
take charge of cultivating different sec
tions of the country.
Agricultural education has not been
popular in the provinces, because it has
been a matter of pride with Indian gen
tlemen thaf they have never performed
any manual labor. But with orders from
their ruler, the Maharajah, they have
taken up the work at the institute.
Higgenbottom is also director of agri
culture to the Gwalior government, and
devotes eleven weeks out of the year
to help improve their land. He has im
ported American implements and is
rapidly installing American systems of
labor. In addition, Higgenbottom gives
agricultural advice to a number of the
Maharajahs.
