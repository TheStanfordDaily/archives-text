"Every step in human progress in its
final analysis rests upon â€¢6ome victory
iu argumentative discourse," said M. L.
McClintock in his talk to Euphronia
Debating Society at their regular weekly
meeting last night. He traced the in
fluence of argumentation during the
Revolution and Civil War. The colonies
were welded together by argument, and
the same potent force brought the North
and South into two compact forces, one

McClintock passed briefly over the
field of influence which argument occu

military methods. This never has
worked and never will work. In order
to fight a thing successfully we must
meet it ultimately with an argument
containing more logic. Salesmanship and
law are two professions which rest
solely upon argument.
"Wc are in the University to become
