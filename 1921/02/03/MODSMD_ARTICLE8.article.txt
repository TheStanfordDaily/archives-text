## Contest is Hardest Fought of Season, Babes Unable to Pierce Strong Guard 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball team
met its first defeat of the season last
night when the Berkeley High School
led it out 19 to 17. The Babes fought
through the game harder than they have
in any other of the contests so far this
season, but were unable to catch up to
the Berkeley lads ;it any part of the
game.
The Berkeley live scored first when
Carver, guard, dropped one through the
ring for the first two counts. McHose
came right back with two for the Babes.
Botfi sides worked well when they got
the ball and advanced the sphere down
to their goal, and then somebody in
variably fumbled and lost the leather to
the opposition. Tnc score climbed slowly
on both sides and the first half ended
14 to 10 in favor of Berkeley.
When the second half opened the
Babes came out with more fight than
they had shown in the first period and
started to close up on the Berkeleyites,
but the high school team drew away and
the freshmen were unable to make the
grade. Granger substituted for Ala
baster,, but could not stop the rush of
the northern team.
In the last two minutes of play the
freshmen took a new grasp on them
selves and it looked for a moment as if
they were going to even the scorc be
fore the whistle. With thirty seconds
to go a pretty bit of passing over the
heads of the high school five put the
sphere under the basket and "it went
through, bringing the score up to within
two points of the Berkeley lead. It was
too late, though, and the final whrt'.r
blew, the game ending 19 to 17.
The freshman lineup was: McHose
and Alabaster, forwards; Jansen (cap
tain). center; Atwill and Sfiiith, guards.
Granger substituted for Alabaster.
