# U. OF C. PROFESSOR COMES OUT AGAINST FOOTBALL STADIUM
## 
### 
A bomb-shell was recently exploded
at the University of California when
a prominent memberf of the faculty,
in a statement issued to the public,
branded the proposed million-dollar
bowl at that institution as a menace
to the future of athletics there.
Professor G. M. Stratton, .professor
of psychology, was the individual who
so dampened the ardor of the boost
ers for the huge athletie stadium. He
pointed out the need for a revolution
in the system of athletics at the Uni
versity of California that would give
a majority of the students an oppor-.
tunity for healthful recreation, which
is now denied. He said:
"A man is welcome to come out.
for sports only in so far as he is pro
mising material for a Winning team.
Such a situation is a perversion of the
real aim of sports, which primarily
should be an, outlet for human ener
gies, a recreation to be indulged in
for the pure cheer and joy of playing.
"We are overlooking the 'do or die'
spirit by laying excessive emphasis
upon winning, and not the playing of
the game. There is no provision for
the average student who merely de
sires to playâ€”regardless of teams and
contest.
"Our crying need is more tennis
courts, this especially with a view to
the health and happiness of the wo
men of the university. How much
will the $750,000 stadium add to the
real welfare of the student body?
"What this university needs is great
er facilities for general participation
in sports than for just passive ob
servation."
