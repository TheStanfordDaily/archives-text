# FRESHMEN PLAY SALINAS COURT FIVE TOMORROW
## Babes Expect to Stage Comeback; Captain Jansen and Quintet Are in Good Shape 
### 
Duffy Seay's basketers meet Salinas
High here on the Encina court tomor
row night at 7:30. The Salinas team
arrives'tonight at 7:15 and will spend
tomorrow as gu3*t3 of the University.
They come with a good reputation
from the southern city and promise
to give the babes a game of the sort
they had at the hands of the Berkeley
High School last Wednesday.
Since the defeat of the Freshmen
Wednesday, Seay has put thtm through
a stiff series of jiactice. I.est night
he worked them in passing and rush
ing the ball. Their work in litis end
of the game Wednesday was shoddy
and they lost a number of easy tries
at the basket. Scrimmage against
the varsity gave the babes the hard
practice they needed last night. All
members of the* squad worked out in
different combinations and showed
more accuracy on the basket ringing
than they have in the several last
contests. This has been the weak po
int of the freshmen in the late games.
The showing of the Berkeley team
against the babes has given all .the
dope on the inter-collegiate game next
Saturday, February 12, to the Bruin
frosh. While they did not show the
Berkeley High team up with a large
lead they beat them decisively and
the local freshmen only kept close
to the high school five by fighting all
the time. They are due to come back
tomorrow night and put on an ex
hibition that will bring them up to
even money with the California first
year men. This game is one of the
last the babes will play before the
big game and they have to put out
their best —now or never.
