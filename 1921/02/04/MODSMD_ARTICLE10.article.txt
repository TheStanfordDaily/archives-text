The European Students' Relief fund
was established by Herbert Hoover to
aid the students and professors in the
universities of the stricken areas of
Europe. A special appeal is being
made to the colleges of the United
States for aid during the campaign
which Hoover is carrying on to raise
$33,000,000 for children's relief.
