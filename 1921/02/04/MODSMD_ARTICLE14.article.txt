# HOUSE MANAGERS PLAN CO-OPERATIVE BUYING
## GROCERS OUTLINE PLAN AT MEETING; APPROVED BY HOUSEWIVES 
### 
First definite steps toward co-opera
tive buying by campus living groups
were taken at a meeting of the organized
house managers in the Women's Club
house last evening. Paul Campbell, '20,
chairman of the committee which has
been working on the plan since The
Daily Palo Alto published its price chart
some weeks ago, presented his report
with a plan f or buying which met with
the approval of the majority of man
agers at the meeting.
One of the Palo Alto grocers has
offered to sell at prices at 5 per cent
above wholesale on canned goods and
1/i per cent above wholesale on other
goods. This compares with the 10/ per
cent above wholesale which house man
agers have been paying. This grocer has
agreed to allow a committee of the house
managers' organization to examine in
voices from his wholesalers and check
him up in all dealings. The plan was
presented with recommendations that
the houses buy in large quantities and
other recommendations as to methods of
buying, but contained no obligation as
to the extent to which the house man

agers' organization trade with him.
Two Palo Alto grocers claimed that
they had no desire for the campus trade.
The advantages of trading with a
local grocer rather than doing wholesale
buying from outside cities were pointed
out, and since the proposition presented
by one of the merchants showed that it
would save managers at least 3 per cent,
a number of the. houses agreed to do
co-operative buying in Palo Alto. These
managers will meet in a few days, when
the grocer will explain the plan which
was favored and answer all questions.
Several representative Palo Alto and
campus housewives were present at last
night's meeting and expressed their keen
interest in the effort to bring about
cheaper living conditions here. The
campus women arc thoroughly in sym
pathy with the move instigated by The
Daily Palo Alto and the organized house
managers and are anxious to join with
any scheme for community buying
which will reduce living costs.
Because of a misunderstanding as to
the meeting place, several managers
were not present last night.
