# CARDINAL QUINTET TO MEET U. OF W. MONDAY
## Local Basketers Are on Last Lap in Drive for Pacific Coast Championship Title 
### 
When Stanford and the University of
Washington basketball teams clash in
Encina Gymnasium on next Monday
night the Cardinal aggregation will
start its final drive for the Pacific Coast
Conference. The northern quintet will
be entertained by the University of Cali
fornia five tonight and tomorrow night
in Berkeley, and these two games will
doubtless eliminate one or the other out
fit from the championship running.
Stanford, Washington, and California
each have won two conference games
to date. In the event that California
wallops the northerners in two games
the Stanford series will not provide a
great deal to go on in figuring the Stan
ford chances. But, should the Wash
ington men trounce the Bruins, the
games next week will be real crucial
affairs and will go a long way toward
determining the Conference champion
ship.
The two games next week are the last
that Coach Powell's men will play on the
campus until February 26. Following
the game scheduled with the University
of California court team at Berkeley,
Stanford will invade the north to play
two games with Washington State and
a return series with the University of
Washington. Upon returning home the
team will entertain the Bruins in the
second game of the California-Stanford
series here on February 26. If a third
game is necessary it will be played in
Berkeley on March 4.
The balance of the schedule is as
follows:
February 7-B—University of Washing
ton at Stanford.
February 11—University of California
at Berkeley.
February 15-16—Washington State
College at Pullman.
February 18-19—University of Wash
ington at Seattle.
February 26—University of California
at Stanford.
March 4—University of California at
Berkeley (conditional).
