# EXCITEMENT GROWS AS FIVES FIGHT IN FINALS
## Alpha Kappa Lambdas Lose to Breakers; Bull Pen Defeats 3rd Floor, Fast Game 
### 
Competition for championship of
the minor intramural basketball
leagues is rapidly growing keener
with the playing of the final games.
Several ties have made extra games
necessary. Three of these extra clash
es occurred last night on the large
court. The results are: Breakers 16,
Alpha Kappa Lambda, 13; Phi
Gamma Delta, 20, Theta Chi, 11, Sig
ma Chi 29, Phi Kappa Psi, 17. The
medics won from the Associated Fed
eral Students, 20 to 8, in the afternoon
game, and the Encina Bull Pen de
feated the Encina East Third, 15-12.
The Breakers-Alpha Kappa Lambda
game was marked by sharp rivalry
throughout. The Alpha Kappa Lamb
das started out in the lead and main
tained their position through the first
half, which ended 7 to 6. The eating
club rallied in the final period, and
with some clever shooting by Peavey,
ran up 1G points, holding the fraternity
team to 13. The Breakers' line-up was
Peavey and McPherson, forwards;
Carey, center; Kirksey and Tisne
guards. For Alpha Kappa Lambdas,
Cornell and Rawlins played forwards,
Becker center and Youngerneel and
Adams guard. Cornell was chief
point-winner for the fraternity five.
The Fiji-Theta Chi ecrimmage was
even more of a reversal of fortunes.
The Theta Chis started strong and had
the better of their opponents by a 9
to 5 count at the end of-the first half.
Gover then went in at center for the
Phi Gamma Deltas, who immediately
began to play like fiends, making 15
points while holding the Theta Chis
to 2. The final score was 20 to 11,
with the Fijis on the prosperous end.
Both Gover and Pitts made sensa
tional shots during the second half.
Pitts, who was captain of the Mon
tana State quintet last year, scored
10 points. Gover added 8. Sibley,
Glenn, Colvin and Dills also played
consistently for the Fijis.
Hogle was the stellar player for
the Theta Chis. Though at disad
vantage against heavier men, he filled
his position at center creditably,
scoring several times on hard shots.
He accounted for 7 of the 11 points
made by his team. C. Starkey, Flem
ing, W. Starkey and Freeman, all out
weighed by their opponnts, played
hard and cleverly.
The Encina Bull Pen sprang a sur
prise by defeating the fast Encina
East Third quintet in a close game
in the afternoon. This is the first
defeat for the Third floor five, and
was not put across easily. The con
test was close and exciting through
out. Eggfeston started for the Third
Floor men. Plimpton, Henderson,
Dierker, and Lembke supported him
with fast team work. Walker, Feheren
Cunningham, Koehler, and Strauss
made up the Bull pen team.
The Associated Federal Students
were outdone by the Medics, though
the competition was closer than the
20 to 8 score indicates. Love, Fernish,
Summerfield, Baker and Beaver play
ed for the doctors. The A. F. S. line
up was Ayers, White, Bradshaw, Nel
son and Mcintosh.
