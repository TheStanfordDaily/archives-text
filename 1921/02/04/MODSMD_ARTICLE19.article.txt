# DIG A LITTLE DEEPER
## 
### 
If Stanford is to turn in a 100 per cent report on the Student's
Relief Fund, more enthusiasm must be expressed by the members of the
student body, and a little more willingness to dig down and contribute
be shown. The preliminary report of the committee shows that about
one-third of the amount expected has been collected, although there are
several organizations yet to be heard from.
Several universities have fallen below expectations in this campaign,
but Stanford must not be one of them. Each individual student must
bear part of the burden to place Stanford among the 100 per cent class,
even though it is a sacrifice.
As a whole the Eastern universities have responded to Mr. Hoover's
appeal in gratifying shape, and justified his decision in placing this
fund directly up to the university men and women who are capable of
giving on broad, general principles to aid fellow-students in distress. A
large number of American university students know what it is to go
without a number of things in order to secure college training, and it is
this class especially that will understand the need of the European stu
dents, and will be willing to deprive themselves to some extent in order
to lend a helping hand to the students on the other side, who are labor
ing under conditions that cause the average college man to wonder how
they can do it.
Aside from the fact that the cause is a just one, Stanford has a
deeper interest in this campaign, and one that makes it impossible for
this University to fail. Herbert Hoover, the man who has won the
eternal gratitude of Europe for his labors in her interest, is a Stanford
man, and in this appeal he has made to the colleges of America, his Alma
Mater must not be found wanting.
