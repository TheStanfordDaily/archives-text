Roland Dorgeles' Les Croix de bois
appears to be the most widely admired
French war-book at present. It gives
a series of pictures more fair than
those of Barbusse' Le Feu; where
no officers ever appear and it always
rains, but preserves an effect of reali
ty by the same horrors of war, and
the slang used In the narrative.
Speaking l'argot des tranchees was
the soldiers' recreation, like pictures
que swearing with the Americans.
Dorgeles' book was written late in the
war after the argot had assumed its
definite form, so the language is worth
studying.
Patrick Macgill is the only English
man who approaches the poignant
agony of such chapters as Le Fanion
rouge, devoted to those who died
under their own artillery; le Mont
calvaire, where a garrison waits the
explosion of a German mine; or Mou
rir pour la Patrie, an execution. Notre
Dame des biffins (infantrymen) em
phasizes the religious spirit in the

French soul. Among the soldier
types the best are the law-student
Demachy, who finally breaks down
when his sweetheart leaves him; Mo
raehe, adjutant and martinet; Sulph
art, of the old army "qui fit la re
traite"; Bouffioux, capable of anything
to avoid the trenches, with a comical
career as a cook; Capt. Cruchet, start
ing an attack with the words: "Mes
amis . . . Ttt, Ttt, C'est pour la
France, hein?. . . Une belle attaque
. . . Nous allons enlever ca"; and the
farmer Monpoix, dying heart-broken
under suspicion as a spy. These sol
diers do not spend every day in the
trenches, they are wounded or leave
the army, return to Paname (Paris),
and when peace comes they look back
to the past and say "C'etait le bon
temps."
