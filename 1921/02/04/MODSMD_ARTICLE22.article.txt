# PROFESSOR A. B. CLARK HEADS ART DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
Art in the university is compara
tively new in this country, and it is
not often in the institutions that do
include an art department in the
curriculum that an ideal and thorough
ly up-to-date course of art study is
offered. At Stanford, Professor Arthur
Bridgmati Clark is directly respnsible
for the present art department as it
now is, keepink pace with the develop
ment of art teaching in the univrsi
ties of the country. In universities
as a whole, art is treated more as a
branch of archaeology than as an ap
plied study and the fact that art is a
thing which is continually changing
and which requires wide-awakeness
and adjustment is often overlooked
in many educational institutions.
The Department of Graphic Art
here has survived and progressed in
spite of many adverse conditions, and
in the face of many handicaps Pro
fessor Clark has kept it on its feet
and as entirely modern as possible.
The existence of the art department
has been a struggle that has required
effort and perseverance and the dif
ficulties connected with maintaining
the department are perhaps not gen
erally understood. The policy of the
University in the past has not been
favorable to the existence of an art
department here and many limitations
have been necessary as a result. One
of the greatest handicaps is the small
teaching staff. Professor Clark has
met this need by arranging special
courses given by out-side men, such
as the poster course now being given
by Emil Grebs and the special course
in color work given during the sum
mer session by Rudolph Schaeffer of
San Francisco. The many Graphic Art
majors owe to Professor Clark per
haps more than to any other one per
son the courses which are now avail
able to them largely through his un
tiring efforts.
Professor Clark was born in East
Onondaga, New York, and after at
tending preparatory schools there re
ceived his degree of Bachelor of
Architecture from Syracuse Univer
sity in 1888. In 1891 he received his
Master of Architecture degree from
the same institution.
Professor Clark was lured away

from his career as an architect for
about eight years, devoting most of
his time to painting. But he returned
to architectural work again, although
not confining himself strictly to that
field. He has, besides his work in
painting, done a large amount of cri
tical work and teaching. He began
as instructor of architecture in Syra
cuse University in 1889. In 1891 he
married Hannah Grace Blrge of Hec
tor, New York. For some time he was
Director of the Trade School and
drawing instructor in the New York
State Reformary, for the education of
criminals. This was the first school
of its kind in the country, and was a
successful experiment in working out
the theory of treating crime as a dis
ease.
In 1898 Professor Clark was a stu
dent In the New York School of Art
under William Chase, and in 1898 he
went abroad for a year to study, be
ing associated both with Whistler
and Twachtman. In 1910 he again
went abroad for an observation trip,
and studied in the galleries of France,
Germany, Italy and England.
In the field of education, besides his
work at Syracuse, Professor Clark
has been actively engaged in teach
ing ever since coining to the Universi
ty in 1592, and has been Professor of
Graphic Art here since 1916. In the
summer sessions of 1913 and 1915 he
was instructor In pottery at the Cali
fornia School of Arts and Crafts, and
a lecturer at. the California School of
Fine Arts in 1919 and 1920. Some of
his architectural work has been, be
sides a number of houses in the East,
the designing of the gymnasium and
Y. M. C. A. buildings at Syracuse Uni
versity, and the gymnasium and cha
pel at the New York State Reforma
tory. He has been the architect for
a great number of campus houses, the
most recen ; : lining Herbert Hoover's
new home.
Professor Clark is a n ember of the
College Art Teachers' Association and
is a member of the City Planning
Commission of Palo Alto. He belongs
to Delta Upsilon fraternity.
Professor Clark is the author of
several books. In 1895 he published
"Observing and Drawing Goometrical
Models," and in 1915 "Design," a text
book which is of .practical use to art
studenis. His most recent work. "Art
Principles in House, Furniture and
Villago Building," has just left the
publisher.

Art in the university is compara
tively new in this country, and it is
not often in the institutions that do
include an art department in the
curriculum that an ideal and thorough
ly up-to-date course of art study is
offered. At Stanford, Professor Arthur
Bridgmati Clark is directly respnsible
for the present art department as it
now is, keepink pace with the develop
ment of art teaching in the univrsi
ties of the country. In universities
as a whole, art is treated more as a
branch of archaeology than as an ap
plied study and the fact that art is a
thing which is continually changing
and which requires wide-awakeness
and adjustment is often overlooked
in many educational institutions.
The Department of Graphic Art
here has survived and progressed in
spite of many adverse conditions, and
in the face of many handicaps Pro
fessor Clark has kept it on its feet
and as entirely modern as possible.
The existence of the art department
has been a struggle that has required
effort and perseverance and the dif
ficulties connected with maintaining
the department are perhaps not gen
erally understood. The policy of the
University in the past has not been
favorable to the existence of an art
department here and many limitations
have been necessary as a result. One
of the greatest handicaps is the small
teaching staff. Professor Clark has
met this need by arranging special
courses given by out-side men, such
as the poster course now being given
by Emil Grebs and the special course
in color work given during the sum
mer session by Rudolph Schaeffer of
San Francisco. The many Graphic Art
majors owe to Professor Clark per
haps more than to any other one per
son the courses which are now avail
able to them largely through his un
tiring efforts.
Professor Clark was born in East
Onondaga, New York, and after at
tending preparatory schools there re
ceived his degree of Bachelor of
Architecture from Syracuse Univer
sity in 1888. In 1891 he received his
Master of Architecture degree from
the same institution.
Professor Clark was lured away

from his career as an architect for
about eight years, devoting most of
his time to painting. But he returned
to architectural work again, although
not confining himself strictly to that
field. He has, besides his work in
painting, done a large amount of cri
tical work and teaching. He began
as instructor of architecture in Syra
cuse University in 1889. In 1891 he
married Hannah Grace Blrge of Hec
tor, New York. For some time he was
Director of the Trade School and
drawing instructor in the New York
State Reformary, for the education of
criminals. This was the first school
of its kind in the country, and was a
successful experiment in working out
the theory of treating crime as a dis
ease.
In 1898 Professor Clark was a stu
dent In the New York School of Art
under William Chase, and in 1898 he
went abroad for a year to study, be
ing associated both with Whistler
and Twachtman. In 1910 he again
went abroad for an observation trip,
and studied in the galleries of France,
Germany, Italy and England.
In the field of education, besides his
work at Syracuse, Professor Clark
has been actively engaged in teach
ing ever since coining to the Universi
ty in 1592, and has been Professor of
Graphic Art here since 1916. In the
summer sessions of 1913 and 1915 he
was instructor In pottery at the Cali
fornia School of Arts and Crafts, and
a lecturer at. the California School of
Fine Arts in 1919 and 1920. Some of
his architectural work has been, be
sides a number of houses in the East,
the designing of the gymnasium and
Y. M. C. A. buildings at Syracuse Uni
versity, and the gymnasium and cha
pel at the New York State Reforma
tory. He has been the architect for
a great number of campus houses, the
most recen ; : lining Herbert Hoover's
new home.
