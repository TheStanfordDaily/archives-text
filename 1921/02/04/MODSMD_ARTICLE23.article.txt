# CABBAGES AND THINGS

*> T. 1., '23 — <S>
The typesetter made a bum out, of
us yesterday. We thought we had a
keen pun, but when the Evening
Bugle came out, he had corrected a
joke 011 one of his own mistakes. Ods
Bodkins! What does he win?
Day before yesterday, the Daily
came forth with an announcement
that Joe Murpliy was going to stage
some livery contests, l)reamy Dan
being responsible for the substitution
of the "r" for the "1." He was only
a day late in correcting it, and wreak
ed vengeance 011 ye Cabbage ed.
When he made the correction, he
couldn't see any joke in our suggestion
to Joe that he "stabilize his livery
squad," and he left that out. When
he finished with our pun, it had about
as much kick as distilled water. That's
the wisp of grass that shatters the
emu's vertebrae.

Irrelevant Point
Indignant Stude —Look'ee here Prof.
Flunkmeout, why is this answer
wrong?
Prof F. —You stated that Caesar was
captured by a Mohammedan pirate
in 1505, whereas the pirate was a
Hindu.
Ind. Stude—Well, who cares wheth
er he was a Mohammedan or Hindu
that long ago.

We wish that Sigma Nu's baron
would take our soul back a few cen
turies when we take those exes in
Far East history. We'd get the real
hop on the course. No more parallel
bars enclosed in parentheses marked
on our papers.

NOW ALL THE METHODISTS
WILL JOIN IN THE CHORUS.
