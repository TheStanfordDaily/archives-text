Douglas Bundv, '21, is captain of the
1921 Stanford baseball varsity. Bundy
has played on the Cardinal nine for the
past two years, most of the time as a
catcher. He has also played tirst base
and in the outfield. Bundy is a small
man as catchers go, weighing but 150
pounds, but this does not deter him
from ranking as one of the steadiest
and headiest receivers that ever wore
a Stanford uniform. His particular
ability lies in getting the work out of the
hurlers. He exercises a steadying in
fluence on the wildest ones and forces
labor out of the lazy ones.
Bundy transferred to Stanford from
Yale in 1917. While in Yale he caught
for his freshman team and was winner
of the broad jump in the Meadowbrook
events in the same year. In a baseball
game shortly after that he broke his
ankle sliding into second base, and this
injury put an end to his track ambi
tions.
Bundy registers from Los Angeles
and is a geology major. He is a mem
ber of Skull and Snakes, Quadrangle
Club, and Delta Kappa Epsilon fra
ternity.
