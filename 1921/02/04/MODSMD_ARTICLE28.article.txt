Coach Seay's freshman basketball five
lias nearly completed its schedule of
games for the 1921 season. Hut two pre
liminary games remain to be played be
fore the big series with the California
Cubs begins.
Thus far the first-year men have suf
fered but one defeat. That was at the
hands of the Berkeley High School quin
tet, who outseored the frosh two points,
winning 19 to 17. This Berkeley aggre
gation had previously lost to the Cali
fornia freshmen by four points, so fig
ures on the impending series between
the two first-year teams are rather
upset.

day Lick High School may come here
to take a whirl at the Babes. The little
big series with California starts Febru
ary 12 here. On Wednesday Stanford
