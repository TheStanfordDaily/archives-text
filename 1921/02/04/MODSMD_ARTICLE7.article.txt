The thirty instrumentalists and vocal
lists who will appear in the American
Syncopated Orchestra and Singers' con
cert tomorrow night in the Assembly
Hall at 8:30 will present a program in
cluding every variety of syncopated
music, as well as many favorite classical
numbers and old negro melodies. This
will be the second appcarance of the
orchestra on the campus, a previous con
cert having been given here last year
by them.
These syncopated musicians are con
sidered specialist exponents in inter
preting' the music of their race. The
voices of the chorus are exceptionally
good and the instrumental numbers are
chosen with the view of presenling
every development of syncopated music,
which is American in its very source.
The American negro has won his
place as a musician of surpassing ability,
a singer whose tones have a distinct
charm of their own. and a composer of
an entirely unique and different kind of
music. In the concert Saturday night a
sharp line will be drawn between the
actual syncopated music and what lias
recently come to be known as "jazz."
Tickets for the concert arc still on
sale at Crandall's in Palo Alto at $1.50
and $1, and at the box office in the Ad
