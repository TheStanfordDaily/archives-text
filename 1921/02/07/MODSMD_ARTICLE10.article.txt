game would be close. The Chinese held
out and played a good game, but their
defense collapsed like a deflated balloon
when the Cardinal forwards got into
their stride and started shooting goals.
The remainder of the first half showed
the defense of the opposition cracking
under the strain. By half time the score

shape and made the game a fast, snappy
one, interesting to watch despite the one
sided score.
