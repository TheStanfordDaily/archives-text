# NATIONAL TRACK MEET TO BE HELD IN CHICAGO SOON
## Winners in All Conferences to Compete; Stanford Has a Chance to Win First Honors 
### 
Stanford University apparently has
an opportunity this year to win the
national college track championship
through the annual College Confer
ence Meet which will be held in Chi
cago, this spring.
The National College Conference at
its meeting in IChicago during the
Christmas holidays determined on
this meet and appointed a committee
to complete the details. This com
mittee consists of Dr. Alonza Stagg,
Director of Athletics at the Universi
ty of Chicago, T. E. Jones, Track
Coach at the University l of Wiscinson,
and R. L. Griffith of the Department
of Physical Education of the Universi
ty of Illinois. These three were se
lected because they were near to Chi
cago where it was determined to hold
the meet.

This will be the first national track
meet ever held and all conferences
and associations in the United States
will be invited to send their first-place
winners to compete. The results of
the National College Conference will
for the first time determine by actual
competition the track and field cham
pionship of American colleges. Such
championships heretofore have been
determined only on paper by compara
tive records.
By this method of comparative
records Stanford last year won the
national track championship. It had
not only more first-place winners than
any other college in the Western Con
ference but among all the colleges
of the United States its track team
secured more places in the theoretical
aH-college team than any other.

On this all-college team, as publish
ed in the officiaT athletic almanac,
Morris Kirksey in the 100-yard dash;
Jess Wells in the 220-yard hurdles;
and J. F. Hanner in the javelin throw,
were given places, while of the other
Pacific Coast Colleges only the Uni
versity of California, the University
of Washington, and the University of
Southern California, won recognition
each getting one man. Only two col
leges in the United States besides
Stanford received more than one place
on this team and these two, Pennsyl
vania State College and Dartmouth
College, received only two places.

Stanford's three place-winners are
in college and eligible to compete this
spring. Kirksey, captain of the team
this year, was recently officially cre
dited with 9:4-5 in the dash
and both Wells and Hanner will be
at least as strong as they were last
year. While under Dink Templeton's
tutelage several other Stanford men
are likely not only to win first places
in the Coast meets this spring but to
make strong bids for the national
championships.
