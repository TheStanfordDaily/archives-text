# 1924 CAGE TEAM BEATS SAUNAS HIGH 37-19
## Freshmen Comeback Strong in Fast Contest; Coach Makes Changes in Line-up 
### 
In one of the fastest games of the
season the Stanford freshmen bas
keters succeeded in overwhelming the
Salinas High School quintet by a score
of 37-19 in Encina Gymnasium Satur
day night. In spite of the lopsided score
the match was no walkaway for the
frosli, and the battle was featured by
excellent passing and good teamwork
on the part of both sides. At the outset
the freshman aggregation took the lead
by making five points before the high
school team could get under way.

At half time the score stood 20-10 in
favor of the Babes. Both teams put up
a hard fight during the half and there
was a constant rushing of the ball. The
freshmen showed great improvement in
their teamwork and in their basket
sho.oting, and although the Salinas five
showed flashes of real class as a rule
they could not compete with the short
passing of the freshmen. The half was
unusually free from fouls and kept the
plays going at a fast rate.
During the second half Coach Seay
replaced the freshmen until all the men
except Captain Jensen, who was unable
to play due to his injured ankle, had a
chance against the high school squad.
Coach Seay started a new combina
tion. McHose and Loewenstein started
at the forward positions with Recder do
ing the work of the center. Atwill and
Wright held down the defensive end of
the game for the frosh. These men suc
ceeded with some good plays. Reedcr
was the individual star of this half,
scoring twelve of the twenty points
made. McHose and Atwill played their
usual style of game, these making
six points between them. Loewenstein
proved a good teammate for McHose,
and he not only broke through the oppo
nents' guard but he succeeded in making
the other •field basket. Whitenburg and
Alabaster showed up well in the second
half. Imlay and Starr starred for the
prep school lads.
