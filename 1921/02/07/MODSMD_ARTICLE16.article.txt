# STANFORD FIVE PLAYS SUN DODGERS TONIGHT
## BOTH QUINTETS ARE FIT TO START CRUCIAL SERIES FOR CONFERENCE LEAD 
### 
Tonight Stanford and the University of Washington begin the crucial
serit-s that will decide whether Stanford is to remain at the top of the Con
ference schedule or whether the Sun Dodgers will pull them down. Wash
ington is the hurdle which Coach Powell's five will have to pass over in order
to retain their present position.
Washington will arrive on the campus today fresh from its series with
the University of California, in which they won and last a game. The Bruins
were successful in the first game played on Friday night, but the invaders
threw a scare into the Berkeleyites which lasted over to Saturday night, when
proceedings were reversed and the Sun Dodgers came out with a victory.

Spectators at the first game, which
California won by a score of 33 to 32,
are still talking about the game put up
by the northern outfit. With but one
day of rest after their long journey, they
played the Bruin quintet off their feet in
the last ten minutes of play, only to be'
nosed out by reason of two fouls in
the last minute of play. Ten minutes
before the end of the contest Washing
ton had but 16 points against 27 for
their opponents, when they started a
campaign that gave them the lead 32 to
31. Two unfortunate fouls gave the
ganYe to California. Saturday night the
boys from the northland stepped right
out and handed their hosts a 23 to 20
walloping.
The Washingtonians are featuring on
this trip the longest center that has
appeared on a college varsity in many
days. Sielk is his name and he stands
six feet six and carries some little
weight along with his inches. In the
opening game in Berkeley he demon
strated his value by reaching up and
shoving through the ball, which was
balanced on the hoop. Besides this feat,
he dropped two out of three in from
the center of the floor.

Another star in the northern firma
ment is Crawford, the running guard.
In size he is the other extreme from
Siclk, weighing but 135 pounds and be
ing built proportionately. He is reported
to be one of the fastest guards on the
coast. A great deal of the credit for
Saturday's victory lias been given to
him.
The Sun Dodgers have a five-man de
fense worked out that is a marvel. The.
standing guard refuses to stand, follow
ing the opposition forwards all over the
court, but his teammates work in to
prevent any possible scoring during his
absence. Against California the north
erners shot from anywhere on the court
with great success, and most of their
throws were from the center.
Against this doughty aggregation
Coach Powell will start Righter and
Davies in the forward jobs, with Lefty
Rogers as first aide. Bert Mills will hold
forth in his usual position in the center
of the court, while Dick Richmond will
play running guard. Captain Adams will
try to keep the Sfin Dodgers away from
the Stanford goal. With this lineup
working in top form. Washington's team
is going to have its hands full trying
to repeat the victory of Saturday. Stan
ford has yet to lose a game, and it is
doubtful if any new precedents will be
established tonight.

A reverse for Stanford at Washing
ton's hafids would drop the Cardinal to
third place, with California leading and
Washington in second position.

The game tonight has all the ear
marks of being a slashing one. Stanford
is fit and ready to do battle with the
visitors and Washington is very confi
dent that it can put a stop to the long
string of victories now credited to
Powell's cohorts.

The game will be called at 8 o clock.
The admission charge will be 25 cents
to holders of student body and season
tickets and 75 cents to outsiders.
All members of the Stanford Band
are requested to get in touch with E.
W. Plaskett in Encina Hall to find out
the ylace of meeting tonight. Ihe band
is to plav for the game tonight, and
tomorrow night.
