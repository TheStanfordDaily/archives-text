### 
Tonight and Tuesday the Varsity will meet the University of Wash- j
ington basketball team in probably the most important series of, the sea*
son. If the Cardinal,is to win the Conference title, it must finish on
the long 1 end of the score of both Washington games. The University
of California team is right behind Stanford in the percentage list, and
the Blue and Gold has never been known to overlook a slip on the part
of a Stanford team. Coach Powell's- \ arsity squad must win both
games in this series, and, as in the past, the Cardinal team is assured of
the full support and confidence of the rooters.
Although pep and enthusiasm is desired as much as possible at the
basketball games, again it is necessary to remind a small group of over
zealous students that Stanford rooters are gentlemen and are able to
control their enthusiasm. Booing the members of the visiting team,
or passing sarcastic remarks about them, is tabooed 011 the Stanford
campus, and the visitors from Washington must have perfect treatment
during their stay here. The past season has seen several violations of
the Stanford code, and it should be the duty of every upperclass student
to sec that sucfi incidents do not foccur again.
