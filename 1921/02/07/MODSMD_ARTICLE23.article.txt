# REGISTRAR ELLIOTT ONE OF ORIGINAL FACULTY
## 
### 
Registrar Orrin Leslie Elliott has
watched Stanford generations come and
go from thi? â€¢ very beginning. He has
held his present position since the estab
lishment of the University in 1891.
Unexpected circumstances have placed
Dr. Elliott in his present office. While
studying at Cornell University he had
no idea of becoming a registrar or even
of being connected with college work.
His ambitions were in the newspaper
field.
Dr. Elliott received his Ph. D. in I.SSS
and was given a doctor's degree in 1890.
During these five years he was an in
structor in English and for two years
did secretarial work for President
White of Cornell. When President
Adams became the head of the univer
sity he placed James Owen Griffin, later
a professor of German at Stanford, in
charge of the registrar's office, with Dr.
EJliott as his assistant.
It was during this time that Senator
Stanford went East to confer with
President White upon the organization
of the University. This conference re
sulted in the appointment of Dr. Jordan,
then at Indiana, as president of
University. Meanwhile, Dr. Elliott had
applied for a position as instructor of

economics in the Indiana institution
Through this letter he received his ap
pointment from Dr. Jordan as registrar
of Stanford University.
The registrar then expected that this
work would be only temporary, but as
the duties of Jiis office wound around
him he found that lie was in the position
to stay. Dr. Elliott has been closely
connected with the organization and
growth of Stanford and every student
who has ever attended the institution
has either corresponded or talked with
him.
During his first year he offered two
; classes in economics, but soon found
that the work flf the office required all
of his attention.
Dr. Elliott published a booklet called
| "Stanford and Thereabouts" in 1906.
I A few years earlier he edited several of
his Sunday chapel talks before the stu
i dents.
His family is loyal to Stanford. Airs.
Elliott has been active among wives of
the faculty, and his three children, two
sons and a daughter, are Stanford
graduates.
Dr. Elliott is a member of Phi Beta
1 Kappa.
