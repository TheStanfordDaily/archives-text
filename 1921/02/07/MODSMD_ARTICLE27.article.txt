## 
### 
Appearing on the Quad for sale the
latter part of the week, the February
issue of The Stanford Cardinal will be
the short-story number of the year.
Three sketches contained in the issue
combine to make up an unusually inter
esting collection of short stories.
"The Mute Chorus," by Carl Wilhelm
. son, is a vivid and beautiful story of
the logging industry in the Northwest.
.The Montana plains forms, the setting
for a realistic tragedy by Frances
Cooper entitled "The War Bridle."
: Katherine Taff has attempted an un
, usual sketch in "A Beautiful Woman."
! and his succeeded in painting a unique <
I character.
Two of the most interesting pictures
| to be published this year by any of the
! campus magazines will appear in the
j February issue. The widow of Jack I
[ London has personally given her per- 1
i mission to The Cardinal to print a por- 1
trait of the famous author which has
never previously been published in a
! magazine. "The Midnight Sun" the
, title of an unusual picture which re
| veals the beauties of a summer evening
j in Ala^aka.
Translations from t\vo of the great
j est Russian poets, Lermontov and Push
j kin, are contributed by Robin Lampson.
1 The translations will appear in an East
ern publication after their publication
by The Cardinal.
Due to unforeseen difficulties the ex
! cerpts from the autobiography of David
j Starr Jordan which were to be pub
lished in tlie February issue have not
: arrived on the campus. The unavoid
| able delay makes it impossible for The
i Cardinal to print the extracts in the
! forthcoming issue.
