## 
### 
Work on the boathouse has been j
progressing rapidly since the plan for I
its reconstruction was adopted and
work started last Saturday. Ernie f
Brandsten, swimming coach, is over
seeing the work. Two landing plat- f
forms for canoes have been built out
from the front and the west end. A
fifteen-foot diving board is in place
and ready. A fifteen-foot platform i
built on the drain pipes about twenty
five yards from* the boathouse will .
also be used for high diving.
Electric lights, running water, and I
dressing rooms will be among the new i
additions. One novel idea almost com- \
pleted is the building of a large log I
j raft to be anchored out toward the \
middle of the lake as a resting place }
for bathers.
