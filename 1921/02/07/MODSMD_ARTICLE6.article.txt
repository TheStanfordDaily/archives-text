sung by the girls' chorus. This song

act work of this kind has been special
ized and perfected to such a degree that
sparkling wines will flow from a rock,
when Jack Heffernan, as *the convincing
Jew, exercises a little of Moses' business
and strikes the rock with his staff. This
is probably one of the most difficult
roles in the play, but is cleverly handled
by Heffernan.

ltincl of Bohemia, where some of the
adventurous men have wandered only
to find there a colony of women who

years previous. Mystery and the spirit
of the Orient pervades the play.

ish dignity a part around which much
