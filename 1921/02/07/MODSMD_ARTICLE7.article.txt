# WHAT IS A KOPECK? "INCIDENTAL FEE" TO DANCE THE ANSWER
## 
### 
What is a "kopeck." For the answer
ask one of the Junior Dance Committee.
On the attractive posters that adorn the
campus it is listed as the incidental fee
to the entertainment that is to be offered
by the Juniors at their dance next Satur
day evening in the Women's Clubhouse.

"Kopeck" means, in terms of coin of the
realm, the equivalent of ten dimes, or the
sum of one hundred round coppers.
This includes the incidental fee for the
evening as well as the tuition and ath
letic expense. There is no syllabus fee,
because there are no syllabi in the course
of terpsichore that is to be offered.
Willit Dorland, Bob Conolly. A1
Carrey, Helen Hauge, Dorothy Hurl
hut are in charge of all arrangements
for the dance.
