Yell Leader Wendell Kinney wishes
to remind the students that the basket
ball series with the University of Wash
ington is the biggest set of games to he
played on the Stanford court this year.
For this reason lie requests that a large
Stanford delegation be present. The
game is scheduled for 8 o'clock, which
should enable all of the houses to finish
their meetings in plenty of time to get
to the game.
