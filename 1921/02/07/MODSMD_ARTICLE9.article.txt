# SYNCOPATORS ARE EXPONENTS OF NEW ART IN CONCERT
## Orchestra Gives Exhibition of Syncopation; Program Includes Negro Melodies 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Syncopation as a fine art was dis
played in all its varied and assorted
forms by the American Syncopated Or
chestra and Singers in their concert
Saturday evening. In the collection of
solos, orchestral, and ensemble num
bers the syncopaters produced such rich
harmonies and riots of rhythm that you
involuntarily kept time with them. And
the old negro spirituals and folk songs,
soothing in their melodies, were sung
with the charm one always associates
with the ballads of the old South.

The thirty talented musicians played
their own music in their own way. Even
in the fastest, most invigorating of the
ragged rhythms their music wasn't the
loud, discordant, "jazzy" kind of "jazz"
of recent vogue. It was something much
more penetrating than that. They didn't
force discords upon you. It was the

very essence of syncopation in its most
refined and captivating form, played by
those who understand it best.

The vocal work was especially good.
I lie company includes two quartettes,
each of which sang several old darky
melodies, and combined forces for the
ensemble numbers, "Swing Along" and
the "Rain Song." Their voices were
most pleasing as to tone, and besides
the choral wofk there were a number of
solos, among them two selections by
Laura Hall, who has a particularly
charming soprano voice. William Haw
kins, besides bis "Song of Steel," sang
as an encore the old basso favorite, "The
Big Bass Viol."
A trombone solo by William Dyer
set forth many new tempo surprises,
and Harrison Emanuel won much re
sponse in his violin selections, in which
he proved himself adept in tone crcation.
"Drumology," a drum solo, was one
of the sensations of the evening. J Minnie
Bertrand is not only a drummer par
excellence, but an all-aroftnd athlete as
well, and added to the intricacies of
sound which lie produced was the fasci
natiyn of watching his performance.

The orchestral selections were all en
joyable in variety of syncopation and in
the compelling rhythms which they of
fered, although the popular numbers
were by no means as up to date as might
have been expected. "Hold Me" and

"La Yida" could well give place to some
thing a little more recent. Sad to say,
Brahms' "Hungarian Dance" seemed to
be the most inspiringly syncopated of
all the offerings. The well-known "Evo
lution of Dixie" arrangement, a series
of variations, however, proved without
doubt what the orchestra really could
do. The concert as a whole formed a
unique and entertaining evening.
