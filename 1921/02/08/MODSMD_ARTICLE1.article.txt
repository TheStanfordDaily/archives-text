# STANFORD FIVE DEFEATS NORTHERNERS IN OPENER
## RIGHTER, DAVIES, ADAMS STAR AGAINST VISITING TEAM IN STIRRING GAME 
### 
The University of Washington bas
ketball team was all that reports had
said it was, but it was outclassed by the
Cardinal quintet last night. The red
shirted players, forced to extend them
selves for the first time this season, dis
played a class of basketball that no
doubt will land them at the top of the
heap in the Conference, and walloped
the Sun Dodgers 25 to 14. It was the
fastest and most furiously contested
game played on Encina court this sea
son.
Both teams started off at top speed,
fighting with every ounce of eaergy
they possessed. For a few minutes it
was anybody's game. Then Talbot, Sun
Dodger captain, was penalized and Bert
Mills made the first point of the game.
A few minutes afterward "Swede"
Righter rung the ball, making the first
Stanford field goal of the game. Then
the battle was on in earnest. The Stan
ford players kept the,ball in Wash
ington territory throughout most of this
period. The* shifty forwards of the
visiting team would angle the ball away
and start hopefully down the court, only
to be halted by a Stanford man, and the
ball would go flying back toward the
Cardinal goal.
It was simply a case of the purple
gold aggregation being played off their
feet. Whenever they were able to get
the ball near the Stanford goal and into
the hands of Sielk, the tall center,
Freddy Adams would start into action,
remove the Sun Dodger from the glob
ule and send it hurtling back to the
other end of the court.
Likewise did Davies contest with the
highly-touted Crawford. The little guard
of the visiting aggregation was all and
then more than the critics said he was,
but he met a man as good as he was in
Davies. Crawford is as big as a min
ute and quite a bit faster, but Davies
was crowding him all the time during
the first period so that much of his
effectiveness was lost.
"Swede" Righter came into his own
last night and payed the star game.
The "Swede" has been playing more
than ordinary ball all season, but last
night his playing was extraordinary. He
made five field goals for a total of ten
points. After making the first basket
of the game he dropped in an unusually
long shot from the center of the field
that was the best of the evening. His
work on the defensive was every bit as
flashy as his offensive play.
The Washington team played a won
derfully fast game in the first period,
but at no time did they endanger the
Stanford lead. The score at half time
was 18 to 9 in favor of Stanford. Both
teams showed the effects of the speedy
first half and slowed down in the second
period. Washington's five-man defense
was more effective against the tiring
Cardinal players in this period and but
seven points were scored by Stanford.
The Sun Dodgers scored five more.
The outstanding feature of the Stan
ford defense was the work of Captain
Freddy Adams. Playing from the basket
to the center line, Adams kept his tei ri
torv practically free of northern men.
Time after time he broke up plays that
looked dangerous and shot the ball to
one of his teammates who took it out
of danger. To Adams must be given a
great share of credit for the Stanford
victory.
The work of the Stanford team as a
whole was co-ordinated and extremely
effective. All of the passing was snappy
and the ball was handled without a
bobble.
Washington certainly has a dangerous
team, and at no time until the final pis
tol was it safe to say that Stanford
would be the winner. The men with
the yellow jerseys exhibited a tendency
to pull the unexpected and were always
to be feared on long shots. Crawford
starred for the visitors, especially in the
last half, when he was all over the court
with the ball. He scored two baskets for
a total of four points.
Mills was the highest point scorer.
He made eleven markers on four field
goals and free throws.
Botli Mills and Talbot for the visitors
were a little off on throwing the free
ones. Mills made three out of seven,
whie Talbot made two out of eight.
Richmond played his usual classy
game of ball at running guard and was
a big factor in keeping the Sun Dodgers
from scoring.
The crowd that witnessed the game
was the largest that lids ever packed into
Encina Gymnasium to see two cage
teams in action. The S. R. O. sign was
out fifteen minutes before the game
started, and more than two hundred
people were forced to hear rather than
see the game. Those who, were able to
get in were well cared for by the man
agement and seated as conveniently as
possible under the existing conditions.

He made eleven markers on four field

Botli Mills and Talbot for the visitors
were a little off on throwing the free

Richmond played his usual classy

The University of Washington bas
ketball team was all that reports had
said it was, but it was outclassed by the
Cardinal quintet last night. The red
shirted players, forced to extend them
selves for the first time this season, dis
played a class of basketball that no
doubt will land them at the top of the
heap in the Conference, and walloped
the Sun Dodgers 25 to 14. It was the
fastest and most furiously contested
game played on Encina court this sea
son.
Both teams started off at top speed,
fighting with every ounce of eaergy
they possessed. For a few minutes it
was anybody's game. Then Talbot, Sun
Dodger captain, was penalized and Bert
Mills made the first point of the game.
A few minutes afterward "Swede"
Righter rung the ball, making the first
Stanford field goal of the game. Then
the battle was on in earnest. The Stan
ford players kept the,ball in Wash
ington territory throughout most of this
period. The* shifty forwards of the
visiting team would angle the ball away
and start hopefully down the court, only
to be halted by a Stanford man, and the
ball would go flying back toward the
Cardinal goal.
It was simply a case of the purple
gold aggregation being played off their
feet. Whenever they were able to get
the ball near the Stanford goal and into
the hands of Sielk, the tall center,
Freddy Adams would start into action,
remove the Sun Dodger from the glob
ule and send it hurtling back to the
other end of the court.
Likewise did Davies contest with the
highly-touted Crawford. The little guard
of the visiting aggregation was all and
then more than the critics said he was,
but he met a man as good as he was in
Davies. Crawford is as big as a min
ute and quite a bit faster, but Davies
was crowding him all the time during
the first period so that much of his
effectiveness was lost.
"Swede" Righter came into his own
last night and payed the star game.
The "Swede" has been playing more
than ordinary ball all season, but last
night his playing was extraordinary. He
made five field goals for a total of ten
points. After making the first basket
of the game he dropped in an unusually
long shot from the center of the field
that was the best of the evening. His
work on the defensive was every bit as
flashy as his offensive play.
The Washington team played a won
derfully fast game in the first period,
but at no time did they endanger the
Stanford lead. The score at half time
was 18 to 9 in favor of Stanford. Both
teams showed the effects of the speedy
first half and slowed down in the second
period. Washington's five-man defense
was more effective against the tiring
Cardinal players in this period and but
seven points were scored by Stanford.
The Sun Dodgers scored five more.
The outstanding feature of the Stan
ford defense was the work of Captain
Freddy Adams. Playing from the basket
to the center line, Adams kept his tei ri
torv practically free of northern men.
Time after time he broke up plays that
looked dangerous and shot the ball to
one of his teammates who took it out
of danger. To Adams must be given a
great share of credit for the Stanford
victory.
The work of the Stanford team as a
whole was co-ordinated and extremely
effective. All of the passing was snappy
and the ball was handled without a
bobble.
Washington certainly has a dangerous
team, and at no time until the final pis
tol was it safe to say that Stanford
would be the winner. The men with
the yellow jerseys exhibited a tendency
to pull the unexpected and were always
to be feared on long shots. Crawford
starred for the visitors, especially in the
last half, when he was all over the court
with the ball. He scored two baskets for
a total of four points.
Mills was the highest point scorer.

than ordinary ball all season, but last
night his playing was extraordinary. He
made five field goals for a total of ten
points. After making the first basket
of the game he dropped in an unusually
long shot from the center of the field
that was the best of the evening. His
work on the defensive was every bit as
flashy as his offensive play.
The Washington team played a won
derfully fast game in the first period,
but at no time did they endanger the
Stanford lead. The score at half time
was 18 to 9 in favor of Stanford. Both
teams showed the effects of the speedy
first half and slowed down in the second
period. Washington's five-man defense
was more effective against the tiring
Cardinal players in this period and but
seven points were scored by Stanford.
The Sun Dodgers scored five more.
The outstanding feature of the Stan
ford defense was the work of Captain
Freddy Adams. Playing from the basket
to the center line, Adams kept his tei ri
torv practically free of northern men.
Time after time he broke up plays that
looked dangerous and shot the ball to
one of his teammates who took it out
of danger. To Adams must be given a
great share of credit for the Stanford
victory.
The work of the Stanford team as a
whole was co-ordinated and extremely
effective. All of the passing was snappy
and the ball was handled without a
bobble.
Washington certainly has a dangerous
team, and at no time until the final pis
tol was it safe to say that Stanford
would be the winner. The men with
the yellow jerseys exhibited a tendency
to pull the unexpected and were always
to be feared on long shots. Crawford
starred for the visitors, especially in the
last half, when he was all over the court
with the ball. He scored two baskets for
a total of four points.
Mills was the highest point scorer.
He made eleven markers on four field
goals and free throws.
Botli Mills and Talbot for the visitors
were a little off on throwing the free
ones. Mills made three out of seven,
whie Talbot made two out of eight.
Richmond played his usual classy
game of ball at running guard and was
a big factor in keeping the Sun Dodgers
from scoring.
The crowd that witnessed the game
was the largest that lids ever packed into
Encina Gymnasium to see two cage
teams in action. The S. R. O. sign was
out fifteen minutes before the game
started, and more than two hundred
people were forced to hear rather than
see the game. Those who, were able to
get in were well cared for by the man
agement and seated as conveniently as
possible under the existing conditions.

The University of Washington bas
ketball team was all that reports had
said it was, but it was outclassed by the
Cardinal quintet last night. The red
shirted players, forced to extend them
selves for the first time this season, dis
played a class of basketball that no
doubt will land them at the top of the
heap in the Conference, and walloped
the Sun Dodgers 25 to 14. It was the
fastest and most furiously contested
game played on Encina court this sea
son.
Both teams started off at top speed,
fighting with every ounce of eaergy
they possessed. For a few minutes it
was anybody's game. Then Talbot, Sun
Dodger captain, was penalized and Bert
Mills made the first point of the game.
A few minutes afterward "Swede"
Righter rung the ball, making the first
Stanford field goal of the game. Then
the battle was on in earnest. The Stan
ford players kept the,ball in Wash
ington territory throughout most of this
period. The* shifty forwards of the
visiting team would angle the ball away
and start hopefully down the court, only
to be halted by a Stanford man, and the
ball would go flying back toward the
Cardinal goal.
It was simply a case of the purple
gold aggregation being played off their
feet. Whenever they were able to get
the ball near the Stanford goal and into
the hands of Sielk, the tall center,
Freddy Adams would start into action,
remove the Sun Dodger from the glob
ule and send it hurtling back to the
other end of the court.
Likewise did Davies contest with the
highly-touted Crawford. The little guard
of the visiting aggregation was all and
then more than the critics said he was,
but he met a man as good as he was in
Davies. Crawford is as big as a min
ute and quite a bit faster, but Davies
was crowding him all the time during
the first period so that much of his
effectiveness was lost.
