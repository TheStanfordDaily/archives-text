The semi-annual student body elections will be held tomorrow for
the purpose of choosing the new editor of The Daily Palo Alto and
representatives to the Executive Committee and various class officers.
Three amendments to the student body constitution also will be submit
ted to the students.
The projwsed amendment which provides for the creation of nomi
nating assembly is worthy of support and should be passed. This method
has been tried at other places and has done much to increase interest in
student body politics and secure capable men for the offices. The spon
sors of the measure state that it will apply to the president, vice-presi
dent, and secretary of the student body and the members of the Execu
tive Committee. Class officers and the Student Council are not included.
The other two amendments fall in the class of excess baggage and
appear to be useless. The one providing that members of the Executive
Committee who are absent more than two consecutive meetings be re
moved from office is a weak attempt as a remedy and should be voted
down without question. If the Executive Committee cannot cut down
absences to a minimum by fines or some other method, something is
wrong with its organization. Dropping a member because of two ab
sences is rather a drastic move and could be used with effect for political
purposes.
The third proposed measure calling for the election of a member of
the Junior Class to the Student Council falls in the same class. It seeks
to make the Student Council continuous by the addition of one Junior,
who shall attend all meetings but shall be without a vote, and shall auto
matically become a member of the Council the next year. It is difficult
to see how the addition of one man could make the Council continuous to
any appreciable extent and how he would be able to influence the four
new members with his years experience. If continuity is desired in
order to secure a more experienced body, two or three members should
be added from the Junior Class, who by their majority, could control the
Council during their senior year. As it stands now, the measure is
valueless. j*
Students must be careful in voting on amendments to the constitu
tion to be certain that the measures will accomplish something and not
merely add useless provisions onto a constitution that is long enough
and has a considerable number of amendments attached already.
