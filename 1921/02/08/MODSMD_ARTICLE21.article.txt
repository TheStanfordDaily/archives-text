# FAITHFUL PORTRAITURE WINS FAME FOR CURATOR
## 
### 
Pedro J. Lemos commenced his ar
tistic career in a log cabin in the moun
tains of Nevada, where his parents,
who were early California settlers, had
gone during the silver boom of the early
eighties.
After their return to California his
faithful protraiture of the corner drug
gist made upon the sidewalk with chalk,
while still a youngster, so impressed the
druggist that every effort was made to
encourage his ability, and while contin
uing his schooling he studied with the
best available artists and became fa
miliar with all of the art mediums.
These early studies were later supple
mented with work in the leading art
schools in the East. Focusing his at
tention upon the art of the book and il
lustrating, he became art director for a
large publishing house, where he illus
trated and directed the make-up of many
books.
With the growing demand in art
schools for practical art courses, Mr. Le
mos was asked to organize a depart
ment in design in the Mark Hopkins
Art Institute of San Francisco. His
work here was so successful that he was
made director of the Institute, and with
new departments installed, Mr. Lemos
soon became nationally known as a lead
er in art instruction. He was appointed
Professor of Design and Applied Art
on the University of California staff
and was made a member of the Univer
sity Academic Committee. At this same
time he was the organizer of vocational
art classes for the Efficiency School of
the Standard Oil Company.
In 1917 Mr. Lemos was appointed to

take charge of the new Art Gallery at
Stanford as well as the Museum. Dur
ing the past few he has issued a
number of publications on art education,
and his courses of study for vocational
art have been adopted by many institu
tions. As an aggressive advocate of art
for life's sake he was known to be an
active supporter of this need for years
and is now widely recognized as one of
the men responsible for the present prac
tical art courses being installed in
American schools.
Mr. Lemos is editor of the School
Arts Magazine, which is published in
Massachusetts, and as the author of
"Art Simplified," "Applied Art," "Print
Processes," "Pen Drawing," and other
books he is known in practically every
high school and art institution in Amer
ica for the help he has given students.
Mr. Lemos has been urged to take up
work in various art institutes, hut he has
no desire to leave Stanford and Cali
fornia permanently. During next sum
mer he will supervise a course of design
and color in Chicago, give four lectures
on art education in Cleveland, and also
do some work in Boston. For the fol
lowing year he has been asked to con
duct a sketching class tour for art teach-
Mr. Lemos has received a number of
medals and prizes for etchings, paint
ers through Italy, Spain, and France,
ings, and handicrafts demonstrating his
achievement and versatility in the field
of art. At present he is working on
material for an exhibition of his work
to he given at Columbia College in New
York, where he studied art. The exhi
bition will later he shown at several
Fastern art centers.
