Announcement Column comes forth
with the declaration that the Ex-Com
mittee "meets Tuesday at $4.00, in
stead of 7.30." Alas, high tuition has
driven us to thinking of and announc
ing time in terms of dollars. Next
week they'll probably meet at 2.75 .

Further down the Colyum we peruse
these enlightening lines; "Cosmopoli
tan Club meets on Library Step."
Must be a small organization to hold
a meeting on so small a space, or else
the step has been extended.

Lefty Luke surmises that said or
ganization is certainly cosmopolitan
to stick so close together.

Cabbage ed. can scarcely refrain
from remarking upon the unusual
sagacity of the pot hound who barked
six successive, distinct times at the
end of a yell for the varsity at last
night's game. And he wagged his tail
in approbation of his own intelligence.
Even the canines are rooting for the
Red-shirts.

The leturn of several Encina men
from a celebration of Chinese New
Years a day or two ago. has resulted
in a midnight gunpowder plot. We
suggest, for the benefit of the few
who get any sleep under the best of
circumstance, that we confine our
spontaneous manifestations of efferv
escent spirit to the daytime. Let tlis
Chinese Club do the firecracker stunt.

We admit that Latin is a dead lang
uage, but how about the so called
dead arts? The undertaker comes to
the front to insist that we've got him
all wrong. He's got to admit that it's
not very lively.

Cab—Little girl, do you swear?
Age—No sir, but I know all the
words.

There was an old man from Serentum,
Who sat on his false teeth and
bentum,
When they said, "What's the loss?
• "How much did they cost?"
He said, "I don't know. I just rentum."

UNLESS OTHERWISE DIRECTED,
PUT THE NUMBER OF EACH
QUESTION ON THE LEFT OF THE
RED LINE. »
