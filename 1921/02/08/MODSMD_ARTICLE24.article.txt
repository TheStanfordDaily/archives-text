MODERN WOMAN, by Martinez
Sierra.
La Mujcr Modcrna or Modern
Woman is the title of a book recently
published in Spain by G. Martinez
Sierra. Martinez Sierra is the apostle
of feminism in Spain. He is one of the
most distinguished of the contemporary
dramatists and in his dramatic master
pieces, notably in Mama, 1912, Mademe
Pepita, 1912, and Amanecer, 1915, he
idealizes Spanish womanhood and de
fends the rights and privileges of woman
with great force. In 1917 he published
liis now famous book, Feminismo y
Espanolismo, where lie makes propa
ganda for the rights of women in Spain,
pointing out in his vigorous style the
status of feminism in the most progres
sive countries, notably in the United
States.
In his latest book. Modern Woman,
published in the summer of 1920, Mar
tinez Sierra begins by declaring that in
civilized countries the problem of the
rights of women in their broadest aspects
should no longer be under discussion.
1 lie great problem before the world at
present, he says, is the new moral and
political life of nations with woman as a
social and political factor, as the com
panion and co-worker of man. The
great war was won by the men who
fought in the trenches and the women
who toiled and suffered everywhere ; and
this is nothing new, says Martinez
Sierra, since woman has* always shared
with man the burdens and sorrows of
all wars and other world calamities.
Martinez Sierra hopes that in Spain
women will be allowed to vote, write
and speak, in order that she may have
a moral and educating influence on the
generations to come without having to
use violence, as lias been unfortunately
the case in other countries.
In summarizing the reasons for advo
cating the full rights of woman, Mar
tinez Sierra lias discovered nothing
new. He gives the usually well known
reasons: she is a human being; if she
can educate a family, as no one will
deny, she can also educate the larger
family, society, the nation, etc., etc. But
the whole problem is treated by one who
is an arti-t and one genuinely appre-
of the liner aspects of the in
fluence of woman in the home and in
society. He fully appreciates, for ex
ample, the fact that the tears of Miss
Rankin, our representative in Congress
when war was declared against Ger
many, were not tears of weakness or
mere sentiment. "The tears of .\Jiss
Rankin are the tears of all the North
Americans, of all the peoples of the
world, who weep because they are to
march to kill one another instead of
marching to embrace one another as
brothers. Let Miss Rankin weep, for
she weeps for all mothers, for all
women, for thus wept Mary at the foot
of the Cross, and her tears did not mean
that she objected to the death of her
Son for humanity,"
This timely book of the distinguished
Spanish dramatist will be welcomed not
only in Spain, but also in our own coun
try, where in spite of our general edu
cation there arc yet many so-called men ,
who would make of woman a mere
slave.
