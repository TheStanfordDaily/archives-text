# BABES AND VARSITY SWIMMERS TO MEET FRIDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
The freshman-varsity swimming
meet next Friday afternoon at 4:30
o'clock should prove a close contest
according to Coach Ernest Brandsten.
The meet will hinge on the 50-yard
and 100-yard dashes and the relay.
Both teams have good material for
these events, and though the "dope"
slightly favors the varsity, the fresh
men are counting on Miller and Grep
pin to upset the proverbial pot of
beans.
Austin, Drake and McConnell will
swim the sprints for the varsity, and
Darling will be the fourth man in the
relay team. The freshmen who will
swim in, the relay are Proctor, Miller,
Burdick and Greppin.
Mills is expected to take the 220
and the plunge for distance for the
varsity. Van Deusen, Wood and
Fletcher ar& doing good work in the
back-stroke for the frosh, and some
predict the frosh will win this event.
