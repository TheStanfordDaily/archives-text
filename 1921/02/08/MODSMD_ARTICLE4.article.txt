### 
In a statement issued today, Man
ager William Vosburgh of the 1922
Quad, corrected an erroneous report
which has been circulated that a num
ber of the managerial tryoutees for
the 1923 Quad have withdrawn from
the race for the managership. Vos
burgh wishes to make it clear that no
withdrawals have been made this
quarter.
A new record has been made by the
management of the Quad this year in
completing the business work of the
year book at an early date. As the
1922 edition of the Quad is to be
printed on the campus, Ihe manager
is allotted a much shorter time in
which to complete the business ar
rangements necessary to publish the
book. Through the co-operation of
different living groups of the Univer
sity, Vosburgh was enabled to allocate
space in the Quad to half of the
groups by the first of February. A
majority of both living groups and
campus organizations tfiave already
paid their dues for the spaceppurr r
chased.
