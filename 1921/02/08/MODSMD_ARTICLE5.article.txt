# ARTISTS TO GIVE LITTLE THEATRE CONCERT TONIGHT
## Nathan Firestone Will Appear In Joint Recital Program With Mrs. Ruth May Friend 
### 
A viola and piano arrangement of
a sonata by Brahms, will be one of
the numbers to be played by Nathan
Firestone in the joint concert which
he and Mrs. Ruth May Friend will
give in the Little Theater, at 7:30 this
evening. This selection is considered
one of the most interesting composi
tions for viola interpretation. Mr.
Firestone will also play the "Marchen
Erzahlungen," of Schuman, a series
of colorful sketches. He is an artist
of considerable note and will be re
membered by many as having given
a concert in the Little Theatre two
years ago. He will be accompanied at
the piano by Mrs. Rudwig Rubenstein.
Mrs. Friend is well known in local
musical work and has taken part in
a number of programs both on the
campus and in Palo Alto. Besides
Haydn's "My Mother Bids Me Bind
My Hair," she will sing a beautiful
composition the "Se Seran Rose," and
also "Where the Bee Sucks," an adap
tion of the selection in Shakespeare's
"Tempest." Tonight's concert will
