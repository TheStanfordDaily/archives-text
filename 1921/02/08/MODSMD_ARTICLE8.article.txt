# BUBBLES FURNISH FUN AND LAUGHTER IN MUSICAL SHOW
## Pershing and Carskadon Star In Clever Comedian Roles; Seat Sale to be Wednesday 
### 
Wednesday at 1 o'clock in the Admin
istration Building begins the big rush
fo rtickets for the Ram's Head show,
"Bubbling Bohemia," to be given next
Fciday evening in the Assembly Hall at
8:15 sharp. Good seats may also be
obtained at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
One of the main reasones for going
to see this musical farce is Thomas
Carskadon. Thomas is the coquettish
old maid who has been deprived of the
privilege of vamping men in her youth,
but at her first opportunity, which is a
late one, she more than makes up for
lost time and leads the younger girls
a merry chase in the science of vamp
ing. Carskadon was a scream in last
year's Ram's Head comedy, but this year
he is two screams.
Dick Pershing, as the lead, is putting
all kinds of pep into the part of the
newspaper reporter, and will put over
with his well-trained voice and pleasant
personality some of the song hits of
the show. When Pershing makes his
appearance in the land of Bohemia, the
"Bubbles" there get their first glimpse
of a real man, and, of course, this
snappy individual is burdened down with
attentions, but handles the situation with
an experienced hand and finishes the
play with a "Bubble" on one arm and
the crown of a hero on his brow.
And as for the chorus—well, the coach
says the pictures don't show the half of
it. And this is true, for every "girl" is
a "star" in himself. Their dances and
songs are exceedingly clever and will
keep the audience holding their sides
with laughter.
Every ticket purchased at tomorrow's
lottery will be twice its value in fun and
amusement.
