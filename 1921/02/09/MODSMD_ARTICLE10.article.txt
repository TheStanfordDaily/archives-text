# FEBRUARY CARDINAL CONTAINS CRITICAL EDITORIAL SURVEYS
## 
### 
The February issue of The Cardinal
is potable for its editorial department,
which contains a constructive criticism
of the university in its relation to the
admission Tf new students. Attempting
a purely critical survey of the Stanford
educational standards in the January
number, the editor of The Cardinal in
the forthcoming issue presents a com
plimentary editorial which suggests
practical methods of remedying the de
fects outlined in the previous number.
The January issue aroused criticism,
both favorable and adverse, from the
Palo Alto and campus publications, and
the forthcoming editorial will present
new aspects of the problems raised liy
the controversy. A second editorial
dealing with the Stanford Union urges
the revitalizing of an institution which
its founders planned should occupy a
needed place in Stanford life.
The second installment of the auto
biography of David Starr Jordan will
lie published in the March issue of The
Cardinal. Due to delay in receiving
proofs of the extracts which were to
have appeared in the February number,
the publication of the installment has
been necessarily postponed.
A trilogy of unusual stories are pre
sented by The Cardinal in the issue to
be placed on sale on the Quad Friday
morning. Variety in title and setting
mark the series. Ranging from the log
ging industry of the Northwest, in
cluding the plains of Montana, and ex
tending to war scenes, the authors have
chosen attractive material and local color
for their stories. The titles, "The Mute
Chorus," "A Beautiful Woman," and
"The War Bridle," are suggestive of the
variety of appeal in the sketches.
