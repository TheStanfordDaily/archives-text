# STANFORD TAKES SECOND GAME FROM WASHINGTON FIVE
## Definite Lead Gained By Cardinal in Race for Coast Supremacy 
### (By HARRY BORBA, '22 
The Stanford Band furnished the music and the Cardinal quintet waltz
ed away with the second game of the Washington series, beating the team
from the north by a score of 30 to 22. Washington sang, "When We Get
You Alone Up North." But it was not easy waltzing. The Sun Dodgers
proved to be unwilling partners to the dance and clogged the steps many
times during the evening. It was some contest, accent that some. First
Washington was in the lead, and then Stanford would pass them, only to
be passed again in a few minutes. One of those games where the spec
tator hangs on to the edge of the seat and flirts with nervous prostration
for twenty minutes at a stretch.

And heroes, they were all heroes.
Washington entered the game with
the same confidence that they had
at the start of the first game. Stan
ford perhaps was suffering from a
slight touch of overconfidence and
was a little careless. Both teams
started slowly, much as boxers do at
the start of a bout. Bert tMills scored
the first point, converting a foul.
Washington hopped into the lead on
a clever shot from Sielk. Then
"Swede" entered the ranks of the
field goalers with the first Stanford
basket. That cracked the game wide
open.
Up and down and around the court
the two teams went with the advant
age first with one team then with the
other. Washington had learned consi
derable from their experiences in the
first game. Instead of playing all
five men in the center of the court
they played Sielk under the goal where
he was dangerous every time he re
ceived the ball because of his height.
They parked a man midway of the
court to receive the passes a la
"Swede" Righter. they discon
tinued the long throws to a great
extent. Above all else they fought.
The score at half time was 14 to 14.
The second half opened with both
outfits fighting like wolves. For a few
minutes there was no advantage.
Then Washington broke the tie with
two brisk field goals, leading by four
points. Stanford for a moment ap
peared to be dazzled by the purple
and gold speed. ~ Rogers broke the
spell with an unusually pretty shot
from the center of the floor, and Mills
added another point, making the Stan
ford score 17 to the visitors' 18. Then
"Swede" Righter upset the fond hopes
of Washington by dropping the pellet
through from the center edge of the
court. The happened at four minutes
before quitting time.
Talbot, Sun Dodger captain and for
ward, made a point on ft free toss,
tieing matters up again. Then Righter
and Mills started to undo the boys
from the northlaiul. Mills shot one
then Righter imitated him, and so they
changed off until the score stood at
27 to 22 in favor of the Cardinal. The
Sun Dodgers called for time out and
conferred but it was of no avail as
there was but one minute and ten sec
onds left to go. The contest ended
with both teams battling in the mid
dle of the floor, after Mills had made
one more free goal and a field shot.
It was the best game that has been
played 011 th Stanford court in two
seasons. The game the night before
was exciting in itself but this game
was more so because of the great un
certainty. There was never a moment
until the final gun when a prediction
as to the winner could be safely made.
At one time with but four minutes to
go and the purple and gold contingent
in the lead it looked dubious for the
Cardinal but Powell's men came
through with the necessary punch at
the right moment.
Who played the best game? They
all did. It is impossible to pick the
star 011 either of the teams. It was
strictly a contest between two well
trained and well-matched teams and
the Cardinal aggregation won.
Bert Mills was the largest point
winner, making eighteen of Stanford's
thirty points. Ten of the eighteen
were on converted fouls and eight
counted from four field goals.
Cornelius Erwin Righter played his
usual hangup game and was the
cause of lots of Washington's grief.
Davies played a hard game before he
was relieved by Rogers, who also
played a very pretty brand of bas
ketball. Richmond and Captain
Adams kept the Washington forwards
so well covered that they must have
thought that they were playing in a
tunnel.
For the visitors Crawford was the
bright light. This boy is a wizard at
getting over the court. Weighing 128
pounds he played the big Stanford
forwards to a standstill at times and
also found occasion to make some
close tries at the ring.
Referee Kerns deserves lots of cre
dit for the manner in which he handled
the two teams in both games. There
was absolutely no cause for argu
ment in any of his decisions and there
was none. He is the most satisfactory
official that has appeared at Stanford
this season.
During the intermission gymnastic
teams representing the University of
California and Stanford gave an ex
hibition of ground and lofty tumbling
and parallel bar work that was ap
preciated by the spectators.

ford score 17 to the visitors' 18. Then
"Swede" Righter upset the fond hopes
of Washington by dropping the pellet
through from the center edge of the
court. The happened at four minutes
before quitting time.
Talbot, Sun Dodger captain and for
ward, made a point on ft free toss,
tieing matters up again. Then Righter
and Mills started to undo the boys
from the northlaiul. Mills shot one
then Righter imitated him, and so they
changed off until the score stood at
27 to 22 in favor of the Cardinal. The
Sun Dodgers called for time out and
conferred but it was of no avail as
there was but one minute and ten sec
onds left to go. The contest ended
with both teams battling in the mid
dle of the floor, after Mills had made
one more free goal and a field shot.
It was the best game that has been
played 011 th Stanford court in two
seasons. The game the night before
was exciting in itself but this game
was more so because of the great un
certainty. There was never a moment
until the final gun when a prediction
as to the winner could be safely made.
At one time with but four minutes to
go and the purple and gold contingent
in the lead it looked dubious for the
Cardinal but Powell's men came
through with the necessary punch at
the right moment.
Who played the best game? They
all did. It is impossible to pick the
star 011 either of the teams. It was
strictly a contest between two well
trained and well-matched teams and
the Cardinal aggregation won.
Bert Mills was the largest point
winner, making eighteen of Stanford's
thirty points. Ten of the eighteen
were on converted fouls and eight
counted from four field goals.
Cornelius Erwin Righter played his
usual hangup game and was the
cause of lots of Washington's grief.
Davies played a hard game before he
was relieved by Rogers, who also
played a very pretty brand of bas
ketball. Richmond and Captain
Adams kept the Washington forwards
so well covered that they must have
thought that they were playing in a
tunnel.
For the visitors Crawford was the
bright light. This boy is a wizard at
getting over the court. Weighing 128
pounds he played the big Stanford
forwards to a standstill at times and
also found occasion to make some
close tries at the ring.
Referee Kerns deserves lots of cre
dit for the manner in which he handled
the two teams in both games. There
was absolutely no cause for argu
ment in any of his decisions and there
was none. He is the most satisfactory
official that has appeared at Stanford
this season.
During the intermission gymnastic

The Stanford Band furnished the music and the Cardinal quintet waltz
ed away with the second game of the Washington series, beating the team
from the north by a score of 30 to 22. Washington sang, "When We Get
You Alone Up North." But it was not easy waltzing. The Sun Dodgers
proved to be unwilling partners to the dance and clogged the steps many
times during the evening. It was some contest, accent that some. First
Washington was in the lead, and then Stanford would pass them, only to
be passed again in a few minutes. One of those games where the spec
tator hangs on to the edge of the seat and flirts with nervous prostration
for twenty minutes at a stretch.

And heroes, they were all heroes.
Washington entered the game with
the same confidence that they had
at the start of the first game. Stan
ford perhaps was suffering from a
slight touch of overconfidence and
was a little careless. Both teams
started slowly, much as boxers do at
the start of a bout. Bert tMills scored
the first point, converting a foul.
Washington hopped into the lead on
a clever shot from Sielk. Then
"Swede" entered the ranks of the
field goalers with the first Stanford
basket. That cracked the game wide
open.
Up and down and around the court
the two teams went with the advant
age first with one team then with the
other. Washington had learned consi
derable from their experiences in the
first game. Instead of playing all
five men in the center of the court
they played Sielk under the goal where
he was dangerous every time he re
ceived the ball because of his height.
They parked a man midway of the
court to receive the passes a la
"Swede" Righter. they discon
tinued the long throws to a great
extent. Above all else they fought.
The score at half time was 14 to 14.
The second half opened with both
outfits fighting like wolves. For a few
minutes there was no advantage.
Then Washington broke the tie with
two brisk field goals, leading by four
points. Stanford for a moment ap

The Stanford Band furnished the music and the Cardinal quintet waltz
ed away with the second game of the Washington series, beating the team
from the north by a score of 30 to 22. Washington sang, "When We Get
You Alone Up North." But it was not easy waltzing. The Sun Dodgers
proved to be unwilling partners to the dance and clogged the steps many
times during the evening. It was some contest, accent that some. First
Washington was in the lead, and then Stanford would pass them, only to
be passed again in a few minutes. One of those games where the spec
tator hangs on to the edge of the seat and flirts with nervous prostration
for twenty minutes at a stretch.

And heroes, they were all heroes.
Washington entered the game with
the same confidence that they had
at the start of the first game. Stan
ford perhaps was suffering from a
slight touch of overconfidence and
was a little careless. Both teams
started slowly, much as boxers do at
the start of a bout. Bert tMills scored
the first point, converting a foul.
Washington hopped into the lead on
a clever shot from Sielk. Then
"Swede" entered the ranks of the
field goalers with the first Stanford
basket. That cracked the game wide
open.
Up and down and around the court
the two teams went with the advant
age first with one team then with the
other. Washington had learned consi
derable from their experiences in the
first game. Instead of playing all
five men in the center of the court
they played Sielk under the goal where
he was dangerous every time he re
ceived the ball because of his height.
They parked a man midway of the
court to receive the passes a la
"Swede" Righter. they discon
tinued the long throws to a great
extent. Above all else they fought.
The score at half time was 14 to 14.
The second half opened with both
outfits fighting like wolves. For a few
minutes there was no advantage.
Then Washington broke the tie with
two brisk field goals, leading by four
points. Stanford for a moment ap
peared to be dazzled by the purple
and gold speed. ~ Rogers broke the
spell with an unusually pretty shot
from the center of the floor, and Mills
added another point, making the Stan
ford score 17 to the visitors' 18. Then
"Swede" Righter upset the fond hopes
of Washington by dropping the pellet
through from the center edge of the
court. The happened at four minutes
before quitting time.
Talbot, Sun Dodger captain and for
ward, made a point on ft free toss,
tieing matters up again. Then Righter
and Mills started to undo the boys
from the northlaiul. Mills shot one
then Righter imitated him, and so they
changed off until the score stood at
27 to 22 in favor of the Cardinal. The
Sun Dodgers called for time out and
conferred but it was of no avail as
there was but one minute and ten sec
onds left to go. The contest ended
with both teams battling in the mid
dle of the floor, after Mills had made
one more free goal and a field shot.
It was the best game that has been
played 011 th Stanford court in two
seasons. The game the night before
was exciting in itself but this game
was more so because of the great un
certainty. There was never a moment
until the final gun when a prediction
as to the winner could be safely made.
At one time with but four minutes to
go and the purple and gold contingent
in the lead it looked dubious for the
Cardinal but Powell's men came
through with the necessary punch at
the right moment.
Who played the best game? They
all did. It is impossible to pick the
star 011 either of the teams. It was
strictly a contest between two well
trained and well-matched teams and
the Cardinal aggregation won.
Bert Mills was the largest point
winner, making eighteen of Stanford's
thirty points. Ten of the eighteen
were on converted fouls and eight
counted from four field goals.
Cornelius Erwin Righter played his
usual hangup game and was the
cause of lots of Washington's grief.
Davies played a hard game before he
was relieved by Rogers, who also
played a very pretty brand of bas
ketball. Richmond and Captain
Adams kept the Washington forwards
so well covered that they must have
thought that they were playing in a
tunnel.
For the visitors Crawford was the
bright light. This boy is a wizard at
getting over the court. Weighing 128
pounds he played the big Stanford
forwards to a standstill at times and
also found occasion to make some
close tries at the ring.
Referee Kerns deserves lots of cre
dit for the manner in which he handled
the two teams in both games. There
was absolutely no cause for argu
ment in any of his decisions and there
was none. He is the most satisfactory
