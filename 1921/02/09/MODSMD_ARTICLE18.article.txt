The Regents of the University of California are considering a
tuition charge for all students in the University, and they have been
advised that such a charge would be legal, according to a news story
in The Daily California!!, the Berkeley student paper. The story states
ihat 110 effort will be made to enforce payment until the finances of the
university require it.
It appears from this information that Stanford will not be alone on
the tuition basis, and that our neighbors will soon experience the joy of
digging up a neat sum each registration day. Stanford was confronted
with the problem of insufficient revenue several years ago, and not
having the State to appeal to, the only course for the Board of Trustees
to pursue was to turn to the students. The University of California has
depended on the Legislature for its money, and until recently the sum
was sufficient, but as the Berkeley institution increased, and the total
registration jumped enormously, it was faced bv an immediate need of
more revenue. The effort to secure the additional money by Amend
ment 12 in the recent election was turned down by the people, and now
the students of the University probably will have to pay.
Stanford students know how hard it is to pay tuition, but thev also
realize that the University must continue to grow and keep pace with
other educational institutions, and since the students are the direct bene
ficiaries, they are the ones who have to pay. If the students of our neigh
boring institution bear this in mind and accept a tuition charge if it
comes, they will save themselves a good deal of unnecessary complaint
and bad feeling.
