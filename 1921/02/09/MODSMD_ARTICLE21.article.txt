# Women Criticise The Cheek-to-Cheek Form of Terpsichorean Art
## 
### 
While in the spring the young man's
fancy may run along certain lines, the
housewife's mind usually turns to
thoughts of housecleaning, and in ac
cordance with this feminine trait the
Women's Conference, has undertaken a
housecleaning campaign that will start
with "cheek-to-cheek" dancing.
In a letter dated February 4, ad
dressed to the president of each sorority
house, the Conference strikes a blow at
this particular form of the well-known
art of terpsichore that will be severely
felt among "queening" circles.
The letter says, in part: "The atten
tion of the Women's Conference has
been called to the extent of 'cheek-to
cheek' dancing on this campus. . . .
Considerable criticism has been made
by both men and women chJperons.
. . . The Conference members de
cided that the best way to cope with
this matter was to ask the president of
each sorority to tell the members of
her house that the Women's Conference
stands behind Miss Bradford in her
attitude toward this form of dancing.
