# NATHAN FIRESTONE, RUTH MAY FRIEND PLAY IN CONCERT
## 
### 
Nathan Firestone, violonist, and Mrs.
Ruth May Friend, soprano, appearing in
joint recital, gave an interesting and
varied program in the Little Theater
last evening. The concert opened with a
viola and piano number, Brahms'
stately "Sonata," for the viola. The
literature of the viola is comparatively
limited, as very few compositions have
been written especially for viola inter
pretation. Brahms' sonata, composed
expressly for the viola, is particularly
suited to the rich, deep tones of the
instrument. It is one rarely heard and
is distinctly novel and different in com
position. Mr. Firestone's other number,
"Marchen Erzahlungen," which closed
the program, is a group of three fairy
tales, arranged for viola and piano.
Mrs. Ludwig Rosenstein accompanied
Mr. Firestone at the piano.
"My Mother Bids Me Bind My Hair,"
a delicate canzonetta written by Haydn,
was the first song offered by Mrs.
Friend. This was followed by "Where
the Bee Sucks," an interesting though
rarely heard song by Sir Arthur Sulli
van, the eminent British composer. It is
one of six Shakespearean songs which
Sullivan has set to music, and is an
adaptation of the poem from the "Temp
est." "My Heart Is Like a Lute," also
sung by Mrs. Friend, is one of a cycle
of songs called "A Lute of Love,' by
Milligan, a young New York composer,
who has written a number of composi
tions during the last two years. "Se
Searan Rose," the last selection, has
been made famous by Melba, and is
familiarly known as the "Melba Waltz.
