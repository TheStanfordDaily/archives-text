# VARSITY MEN

### 
Because of his ability to receive the
ball from any angle and to shoot with
out straightening up, Bert Mills has
gained the reputation of being one of
the best centenders in Pacific Coast
Basketball. Blessel with a fighting
spirit he is one of the mainstays of
the Cardinal varsity. He has scored
more than half of the points made by
Stanford this year. He has never
made less than one-half of the mark
ers in a game and in two games he
made more than two-thirds.
Mills is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs
170 pounds. He is but 20 years of
age and gives promise of being con
siderable of a man when he attains
his full growth. Right now he is so
much of a man that the opposing
coaches invariably set two men to
watch him.
This is the second season that he has
played on the varsity. Previous to
coming to Stanford he played basket
ball at the College of the Pacific. Bert
is likewise somewhat of aetaoinmm
er. He has never been around the
University in the Spring Quarter tc
work with the red-shirted nine but
he cannot live down his reputation.
Unfortunately this in Mills' last
year at Stanford as he graduates from
the Economics department in April.
