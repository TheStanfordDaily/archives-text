# CAST FOR "THE YELLOW JACKET" IS ANNOUNCED BY COACH GORDON DAVIS
## English Club will Stage Play on March 8; Thirty Students to Take Part in Drama 
### 
George C. Hazelton and Benrimo's
conventional Japanese novelty play
"The Yellow Jacket," will be produced
by the English Club, Tuesday, March
8, the evening before Founder's Day.
The cast has been fully chosen by
Coach Gordon Davis.
"The Yellow Jacket," presents in
English, the conversations of the
Chinese Theater, which have changed
but little through hundreds of years.
"While the story is original, the play
depicts and brings together with
authenticity, eustoms, action and music
in the same way they are presented
by the Celestials themselves," says
Coach Davis. "The drama is a rich
playground for the imagination, for
no stage in the world is so interwoven
with delightful suggestive conventions
as that of the Chinese."
The most important parts are the
property man, taken by Dean Ross,
'23, who does not speak a word; Daf
fodil. a part made famous by Schyler
Ladd, played by Mathew Torbiner,
'24; and the part of Woo Hoo Git, by
Coach.Davis. Among the women, the
lead, Moy Fah Loy, Plum Blossom, is
taken by Anne Gardner, '21.
Coach Davis's part in the drama is
a revival of an old tradition of the
English Club. In past years the so
ciety always included some member
of the faculty in their casts. English
Club productions were "the common
meeting ground of faculty and stu
dents in campus dramatics." In 1917,
when "The Great Divide" was staged,
Professor William B. Owens took an
important part. The Club requested
Davis to take this part as he played
if at Carvel-by-the-Sea last year.
Ross, who takes the peculiar silent
part, made his first appearance this
year in dramatics. He took the lead
in the Sophomore comedy, "Wedding
Bells." Tobriner will make his first
appearance in the coming production.
"This man is a discovery and very
good," says Davis.
Anne Gardner played in the Mas
quers' play by the lake last year, and
has taken part in Junior operas.
Emily Wordman, a new student here,
will star in the second lead.
With thirty members on the cast,
the production of "The Yellow Jacket"
affords the best of opportunities to
campus actors. It is a play that is
different and will call for excellent
character work.
