# GLEE CLUB ARTICLE FEATURES FEBRUARY ILLUSTRATED REVIEW
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club, as an adver
tising agency for the University, is
the subject matter of an article by
Dan Evans, '20, in the February issue
of the Illustrated Review. A Glee
Club story is especially appropriate
at this time, since the organization
is to start soon on the season's tour.
The first program will be given at the
Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco.
Pictures of the Glee Club and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, taken
on the local platform, are printed in
conjunction with Evans' article. The
local club is the only organization of
its kind to have been photographed
in connection with the Symphony
Orchestra.
"Stanford Men in the Oil Industry,"
by Anita Schwarzenbeck, outlines the
successes of Cardinal graduates in
this great natural industry, giving
many examples of men who have risen
to high positions in the world of oil.
The unusual success of Stanford men
in this work, makes the story one of
great interest to college students and
graduates.
The February Review is dedicated
to Dr. Jordan on the occasion of his
seventieth birthday, and includes
several poems, chief among which are
dedicatory lines to the ChanCiellor-
Emeritus, by Dare Stark, '17.
In the pictorial field, the next issue
of the Review is featured by the latest
picture of the varsity basketball team,
cuts of the Stanford and University
of British Columbia rugby teams, and
a full-page group of Stanford views.
The Review will appear on the cam
pus within the next few days.
