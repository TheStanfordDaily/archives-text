# WINE, WOMEN AND SONG TO INVADE CAMPUS FRIDAY
## Rams Head's Great Musical Farce to Have Scenes Full of Originality and "Pep" 
### 
The Assembly Hall Friday night will
be a scene of "Wine, Women, and
Song, and all the good feeling that
goes with it. Bubbling Bohemia is full
of originality and pep, clever musical
numbers, and action. Every part is a
character part that has called "for hard
work and cleverness on the part of its
interpreter.
One of the best of the musical num
bers will be a dance savoring of the
Oriental, with lony and the Vamp do
ing the specialties. The part of Tony
is probably the most difficult in the cast,
but it is being exceedingly well handled
by Dermont Macconel,' who is making
his debut in campus dramatics. His
Italian dialect savors of spaghetti and
garlic and "Shores of I-taly."
Hollis Chalmers, as the professor,
pictures all this is thoughtful and pon
derous in professors, in the first act, but
in the second act he loses his decorum
and falls for the "Queen." His conduct
from then on is not as a professor's
should be, but is light and giddy and,
allegorically speaking, he is pomposity
with bells.
Paul Clafiin gives the accepted
lesque Englishman with a good line and
a brainless head. He puts over the song
"It's Not the Wine" with a pathetic
wistfulness that brings tears to the eyes.
The cast is backed up by a clever
chorus that executes the songs and
dances with grace and daintiness.
Good seats for the show may still be
obtained from Crandall's in Palo Alto.
