# NED PRATHER '23 STARS IN RAM'S HEAD PRODUCTION
## Dress Rehearsal Demonstrates Versatility of Cast; Dick Pershing Clever as Reporter 
### MELBA BERRY, '22 
The three acts chuck full of clever
lines went off with smoothness and
accuracy .at the dress rehearsal of the
Ram's Head musical extravaganza,
"Rubbling Bohemia," last night. For the
short time that the cast and chorus have
had to whip their play into shape the
showing was exceedingly good for a
dress rehearsal.
Dick Pershing, playing the reporter,
has put into his part an interpretation
that is all his own, and adds punch and
snap to the play. Dick wins the heart
of the innocent young girl, Ardys Dean,
who, though reserved and backward in
manner and speech, has the appearance
that would lead one to believe that
"she" could hold her own.
We are also requested to keep our eyes
on Ned Prather, the Baby Vamp, who
bids fair to be the hit of the show.
Prather has worked up some clever
characterizations that would make
Julian Eltinge himself jealous. One of
Prather's best numbers is "It's the
Clothes That Make the Women." Not
enough can be said for the dance that
he and Dermont Macconel, as Tony, put
over. It is a decidedly new innovation
in campus dramatics.
S. H. Mendenhall takes all prizes for
comedy stuff, and though a sworn old
maid, is won by the persuasive arts of
the convincing Jew, Jack Heffernan.
A surprise, however, is reserved in
the mystery surrounding the Prohibi
tion Sleuth, Nelson Valjean, who will
keep his audience sitting 011 the edge
of their seats from his entrance IQ his
exit. He is a bold, bad man, with a weak
spot in his character that brings about
his ruination.
The chorus should come in for a fevy
of these compliments, but adjectives are
few, so we'll let them tell their own
story Friday evening at 8:15 in the
Stanford Assembly Hall. The seat sale
has been a record one for Ram's Head
Society, but a few good seats are still
011 sale.
