# INTRODUCTION OF HONOR SYSTEM IS ADVOCATED IN COMMITTEE REPORT
## Group Appointed to Investigate Matters Favors Adoption of Plan as Proposed 
### 
The committee, consisting of G. M.
Kyle, chairman, H. A. Brown, C. A.
Wilcox, P. E. Erickson, and A. West
wick, which was appointed last quarter
by Student Body President Floyd Mc-
Elroy to investigate the possibilities of
installing the honor system at Stanford,
has, after an exhaustive study of the
situation, made the following report:
1. That any honor system that does
not have its original impulse from an
earnest desire of the students them
selves will be a failure.
2. That no committee can hope to
introduce such a system in Stanford by
itself. The movement must come from
the student body as a whole under the
guidance, of course, of a certain direc
tion and leadership from some organized
body.
3. That in view of these circumstances
and in view of the earnest desire of
the majority of Stanford men and
women to have an honor system, the
committee has taken it upon itself to
interview students and heads of many
of the departments as to the feasibility
of the introduction of such a system.
4. That everywhere there has been an
overwhelming sentiment in favor of the
honor system.
5. That from past experience Jias
been found best to lay more stress upon
the prevention of cheating than upon
the means of punishment. That an in
tensive educational campaign be com
menced in order to inculcate this view
into the, new men in Stanford. That
?3Cb incoming class /or the next few
years be present at an assembly where
the ideals and purpose of the Stanford
system be impressed upon them.
6. That cards be printed by the stu
dent body, to be placed in all rooms
where examinations are being con
ducted under the honor system, which
shall bear the following mott^:
THE HONOR SYSTEM IS ON
TRIAL AT STANFORD. WILL YOU
DO YOUR PART?
7. That any' rn.m who cheats with
those words staring him in the face does
not deserve the honor of being a Stan
ford man.
8. That this plan will be forced on no
department. All departments wishing to
adopt the system can obtain the details
of the internal organization required
from the committee.
9. That no organization will be re
quired save some body of men in the
department who will take it upon them

selves to see that every possible aid is
given towards the success of the suc
cess of the system, and, while making
every effort to see that NO CHEA IING
OCCURS, will try to see that all offend
ers are brought before the Men's Coi\ n> t
cil.
10. That in the Geolbgy and Miniu.g
departments the G, Und M. Sblnety takes
this function upon itself, and in ot'ner
departments which already have such
organizations, these organizations are in
a position to take upon themselves ihe
same task.
11. That the committee believes sin
cerely that the men and women of Stan
ford arc of the caliber to make the honor
system work, and starts out on its work
with every confidence of help and co
operation.
There has been a well-defined and
growing sentiment oi late towards the
adoption of an honor system. Articles
have been coming out in the magazineg
and editorials have been written on the
subject by the various campus editors.
It has beerf talkecl on the corners of
the Quad and discussed in every walk of
college life, all the time growing and
becoming more concrete, and just now
coming to active expression. Its main
justification and the reason for taking '
the trouble for its adoption, according ,
to Marion Kyle, '18, chairman of the
committee, is that primarily it creates
a standard of action that raises the ,
student both in his own estimation and
in that of his associates.
"When men or women say they arg
from Stanford it will mean much more,
and they will say it with more pride if
they know that Stanford men and
women are a caliber which can make
an honor system work. It will mean
that the students and the faculty are
closer together and regard themselves I
as part of a big and comprehensive plan
to turn but betttr citizens and make
finer and better personalities, and in
this Capacity of mutual aid and under
standing to make the work easier and
more congenial for all concerned. At
present there is a tendency for the stu
dent to regard the professor who paces
his room with a watchful eye in the
light of a jailer and not as a companion
in the march towards better progress in
the business of living* It will mean
that no student gets a Stanford degree
pn stolen credits and that this move
ment is primarily an undergraduate pro
test against such procedure."

as part of a big and comprehensive plan
to turn but betttr citizens and make
finer and better personalities, and in
this Capacity of mutual aid and under
standing to make the work easier and
more congenial for all concerned. At
present there is a tendency for the stu
dent to regard the professor who paces
his room with a watchful eye in the
light of a jailer and not as a companion
in the march towards better progress in
the business of living* It will mean
that no student gets a Stanford degree
pn stolen credits and that this move
ment is primarily an undergraduate pro
test against such procedure."
The committee, consisting of G. M.
Kyle, chairman, H. A. Brown, C. A.
Wilcox, P. E. Erickson, and A. West
wick, which was appointed last quarter
by Student Body President Floyd Mc-
Elroy to investigate the possibilities of
installing the honor system at Stanford,
has, after an exhaustive study of the
situation, made the following report:
1. That any honor system that does
not have its original impulse from an
earnest desire of the students them
selves will be a failure.
2. That no committee can hope to
introduce such a system in Stanford by
itself. The movement must come from
the student body as a whole under the
guidance, of course, of a certain direc
tion and leadership from some organized
body.
3. That in view of these circumstances
and in view of the earnest desire of
the majority of Stanford men and
women to have an honor system, the
committee has taken it upon itself to
interview students and heads of many
of the departments as to the feasibility
of the introduction of such a system.
4. That everywhere there has been an
overwhelming sentiment in favor of the
honor system.
5. That from past experience Jias
been found best to lay more stress upon
the prevention of cheating than upon
the means of punishment. That an in
tensive educational campaign be com
menced in order to inculcate this view
into the, new men in Stanford. That
?3Cb incoming class /or the next few
years be present at an assembly where
the ideals and purpose of the Stanford
system be impressed upon them.
6. That cards be printed by the stu
dent body, to be placed in all rooms
where examinations are being con
ducted under the honor system, which
shall bear the following mott^:
THE HONOR SYSTEM IS ON
TRIAL AT STANFORD. WILL YOU
DO YOUR PART?
7. That any' rn.m who cheats with
those words staring him in the face does
not deserve the honor of being a Stan
ford man.
8. That this plan will be forced on no
department. All departments wishing to
adopt the system can obtain the details
of the internal organization required
from the committee.
9. That no organization will be re
quired save some body of men in the
department who will take it upon them

selves to see that every possible aid is
given towards the success of the suc
cess of the system, and, while making
every effort to see that NO CHEA IING
OCCURS, will try to see that all offend
ers are brought before the Men's Coi\ n> t
cil.
10. That in the Geolbgy and Miniu.g
departments the G, Und M. Sblnety takes
this function upon itself, and in ot'ner
departments which already have such
organizations, these organizations are in
a position to take upon themselves ihe
same task.
11. That the committee believes sin
cerely that the men and women of Stan
ford arc of the caliber to make the honor
system work, and starts out on its work
with every confidence of help and co
operation.
There has been a well-defined and
growing sentiment oi late towards the
adoption of an honor system. Articles
have been coming out in the magazineg
and editorials have been written on the
subject by the various campus editors.
It has beerf talkecl on the corners of
the Quad and discussed in every walk of
college life, all the time growing and
becoming more concrete, and just now
coming to active expression. Its main
justification and the reason for taking '
the trouble for its adoption, according ,
to Marion Kyle, '18, chairman of the
committee, is that primarily it creates
a standard of action that raises the ,
student both in his own estimation and
in that of his associates.
"When men or women say they arg
from Stanford it will mean much more,
and they will say it with more pride if
they know that Stanford men and
women are a caliber which can make
an honor system work. It will mean
that the students and the faculty are
