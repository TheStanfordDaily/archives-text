Coach ' _
Stanfo- 4 °welt will lead the successful
t 'd varsity to Berkeley
yfrow iioi»fit (o contest with the
.wins in th«< first game of HW Cali
W>rnia-Stanford series. Tl>k gaitto' at-'
I Harmon Gymnasium will be the firsf*
stopover in Stanford's final drive for
the championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
From Berkeley the team will go north
to Pullman, with stopovers at Portland
and Spokane, to meet the Washington
State Cougars in a two-game series.
Then the men will go back to Spokane
and thence to Seattle, where they wilt
play a return series with the University
of Washington. The trip will take up.
ten days and five games will be played.
In order to cop the title in the Con
ference it will be necessary for Stan
ford to win three of the five games;.
[ The hardest games of the tour will be
with the purple and gold aggregation at
Seattle. This team forced Stanford to
extend itself in the series just com
pleted here, and they may ilip over a
win or two on their own court.
Likewise, the game at Berkeley to
morrow night should be a difficult one.
Although California lost one game to
Washington and Stanford won both
games from the northerners, the Bruins
are always dangerous when playing
against the Cardinals. California is in
second place in the Conference stand
ing and is tied with Stanford for first
place in the California-Nevada League,
so that a great deal depends upon the
outcome of this game.
Powell will start the regular lineup
against California. Righter and Davies
will play forward, with Mills in center,
and Richmond and Adams in the guard
positions. From the way this outfit went
against Washington they should win
against the Berkeley team.
California "will present their usual
lineup with Colp, Larkey, Lggleston,
Symes, O'Neill, and Lc Hane.
The following men will make the
northern trip:
Captain Fred Adams, Bert Mills,
"Swede" Righter, Jimmy Davies, Dick
Richmond, "Lefty" Rodgers, Ralph
Carver, Fred Anderson, Coach Walter
Powell, and Manager "Wash" Con
