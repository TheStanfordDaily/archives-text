# AN APPARENT NEED
## 
### 
Further evidence that an honor system is badly needed at Stanford
is furnished by the increasing number of reports that are being - made of
notebooks being stolen from window ledges on the Quad, and from
other supposedly safe places, just before examinations are to be held.
This practice is becoming more and more prevalent, so that it seems
perfectly proper to a number of students to make use of stolen notes,
and nothing will be said of it.
Making use of stolen notebooks before an examination amounts
to the same thing as cheating, and should be treated as such by the
Men's Council. Students who fall into this practice are even lower
than those who cheat in examinations, for they deprive the rightful
owner of the notes from studying for the examination. It should go
hard with offenders if they are caught at this game.
The adoption of an honor system should remove much of this evil.
If students are given to understand that they are entirely on tlieir honor
in all ways, and that no infractions of the honor code will be permitted,
there will be no more cases of stolen notebooks reported. Students who
would violate the honor principle are very rare, and those who do should
not be allowed to remain here.
