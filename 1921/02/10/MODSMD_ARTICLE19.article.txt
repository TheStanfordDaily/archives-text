# GO TO BERKELEY
## 
### 
Tomorrow night the Varsity plays the University of California
basketball team in the first game of the Stanford-California series. The
game will be played at Berkeley, and the Cardinal team will have to per
form before a large crowd of enthusiastic Blue and Gold rooters. Stan
ford is at present leading the Pacific Coast Conference, and the Stan
ford student body is confident that the California scries will not put a
crimp in the Cardinal hopes. In order to assure the Varsity that this
confidence does exist, every Stanford man and woman who can possibly
get away should be at the game tomorrow night and be ready to give a
"Skyrocket" when Coach Powell's team comes on the Boor.
