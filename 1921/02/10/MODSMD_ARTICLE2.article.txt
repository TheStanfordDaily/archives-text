# RICHARD MALABY, '23 TO DIRECT MUSIC IN 'THE YELLOW JACKET'
## 
### 
Richard Malaby, '23, will have
charge of all the music for the Eng
lish Club play "The Yellow Jacket"
to be produced March 8. The music
for the drama is one of the most im
portant factors in the conventional
Oriental drama. Malaby is known on
the campus for his ability to compose
and direct music.
Half of the orchestra is placed on
the stage in full view of the audience.
Tlie music follows the action of the
play and the weird strains produced
by the musicians add color to the
play. One of the most amusing in
struments of the orchestra is the
moon harp.
The unique features as found in the
orchestra, and the difficult character
acting are the basic foundation for
the Oriental play's success. To the
Chinese, the play might carry pathos
and deep emotional qualities. To the
Englishman and American the novelty
of the drama worked out by the
Japanese conventions produce a hu
morous tinge.
