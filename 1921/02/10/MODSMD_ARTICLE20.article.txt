# THEODORE HOOVER NOTED AS AUTHORITY ON ORES
## 
### 
The appointment of Theodore Hoov
er, March 28, 1919, as Professor of
Mining and Metallurgy, marked a new
period in the development of the
teaching of mining at Stanford. Pre
viously the subject had been taught
in close connection with geology, but
the appointment of Professor Hoover
was coincident ,with itiie formation
of a graduate School of Mining and
Metallurgy of which he became di
recting head.
The aim of the present Mining
School is neither to supercede or to
duplicate* the work associated de
partments. Candidates for admission
into the school are largely trained in
the Departments of Geology, Chem
istry, and Engineering. Special atten
tion is given to the mining and metal
lurgy of metals in which work Stan
ford graduates have been so success
ful.
The life of Hoover at Stanford was
typical of many of those who attended
in the pioneer days. He was active in
college affairs in his undergraduate
days from 1898 to 1901, graduating on
the latter date from the Department
of Geology and Mining. The ever
present campus politician was active
even in the days which older Stanford
graduates are wont to call the "Golden
Period" of the University. Ballot
box stuffing in student body elections
had corrupted student activities and
Hoover was a leader in a reform
movement which placed the elections
on a clean basis. The Geology and
Mining Society had its origin at that
time when he was instrumental in

forming the organization. The Board
of Control of Athletic Fields had its
forerunner in the Training House
Corporation which he aided in orga
nizing.
The career of Theodore Hoover as
a mining engineer is in many ways
similar to that of his brother, Herbert
Hoover. An apprenticeship in his
profession was served by three years'
work as an assistant engineer with
several California firms. Extending
his field of work, he became in 1906
consulting engineer for the Cosmo
politan Proprietary, Ltd., in London
and Mexico.
Following his appointment as con
sulting engineer for the Minerals
Separation, Ltd., London, in 1900, he
developed the flotation process of ore
concentration. This work provided
him with the material for his book on
the "Concentration of Ores," which
is regarded by engineers as the
authoritative text on the subject.
Extending the scope of his efforts
during the next decade, Hoover be
came one of the leaders of that group
of American who are internationally
known as mining experts. From 1911
to 1919, when he returned to Stan
ford, he was consulting engineer for
a number of English, Oriental, and
American mining firms. Engineering
skill as well as administrative ability
marked his work in these positions.
Professor Hoover, in the course of his
professional duties, has traveled ex
tensively in Mexico, India, Russia,
Australia, Germany and Asia Minor,
visiting the main mining centers of
the world.

teaching of mining at Stanford. Pre
viously the subject had been taught
in close connection with geology, but
the appointment of Professor Hoover
was coincident ,with itiie formation
of a graduate School of Mining and
Metallurgy of which he became di
recting head.
The aim of the present Mining
School is neither to supercede or to
duplicate* the work associated de
partments. Candidates for admission
into the school are largely trained in
the Departments of Geology, Chem
istry, and Engineering. Special atten
tion is given to the mining and metal
lurgy of metals in which work Stan
ford graduates have been so success
ful.
The life of Hoover at Stanford was
typical of many of those who attended
in the pioneer days. He was active in
college affairs in his undergraduate
days from 1898 to 1901, graduating on
the latter date from the Department
of Geology and Mining. The ever
present campus politician was active
even in the days which older Stanford
graduates are wont to call the "Golden
Period" of the University. Ballot
box stuffing in student body elections
had corrupted student activities and
Hoover was a leader in a reform
movement which placed the elections
on a clean basis. The Geology and
Mining Society had its origin at that
time when he was instrumental in

forming the organization. The Board
of Control of Athletic Fields had its
forerunner in the Training House
Corporation which he aided in orga
nizing.
The career of Theodore Hoover as
a mining engineer is in many ways
similar to that of his brother, Herbert
Hoover. An apprenticeship in his
profession was served by three years'
work as an assistant engineer with
several California firms. Extending
his field of work, he became in 1906
consulting engineer for the Cosmo
politan Proprietary, Ltd., in London
and Mexico.
Following his appointment as con
sulting engineer for the Minerals
Separation, Ltd., London, in 1900, he
developed the flotation process of ore
concentration. This work provided
him with the material for his book on
the "Concentration of Ores," which
is regarded by engineers as the
authoritative text on the subject.
Extending the scope of his efforts
during the next decade, Hoover be
came one of the leaders of that group
of American who are internationally
known as mining experts. From 1911
to 1919, when he returned to Stan
ford, he was consulting engineer for
a number of English, Oriental, and
American mining firms. Engineering
skill as well as administrative ability
marked his work in these positions.
Professor Hoover, in the course of his
professional duties, has traveled ex
tensively in Mexico, India, Russia,
Australia, Germany and Asia Minor,
visiting the main mining centers of
the world.
The appointment of Theodore Hoov
er, March 28, 1919, as Professor of
Mining and Metallurgy, marked a new
period in the development of the
teaching of mining at Stanford. Pre
