# PHI GAMMA DELTA WINS INTRAMURAL TITLE IN LEAGUE
## 
### 
In a game that was as tight as the
tightest, the intramural five repre
senting the Phi Gamma Delta house
yesterday defeated the Sigma Nu
quintet by the score of 3 to 2, and
thereby annexed the title in League
2. The game was marked by erratic
playing on both sides and many
baskets were missed when the shooter
had plenty of time and a clear floor.
Long, of the Sigma Nu team, threw
the only field goal which was tossed
during the game, and Gover, the fighl*
ing center of the Fiji team, tossed
three free throws out tof four for his
team, these points winning the game.
Two field goals were tossed, one by
each team, after the whistle had blown
but could not be counted.
As may be seen from the score, the
game was exciting from start to
finish, one man could not hold the
ball for more than a fraction of a
second. At the end of the first half,
neither team had scored, and by the
end of the second half the score stood
two-all, which necessitated the play
ing of an extra five minutes, during
which time the Fijis annexed one more
point, and the title to their league.
