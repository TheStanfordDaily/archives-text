# FEBRUARY 22 IS SET FOR IRISH MARATHON ON STANFORD TRACK
## 
### 
February 22 is the date set for the
annual Irish Marathon, to be held on the
Stanford oval. Twenty-four men will
compete on each team over a course
covering six miles. The Quadrangle
Club will offer medals to the men on
both non-varsity and varsity teams mak
ing the best record for the quarter mile.
This meet in the past has served to
bring forth the most promising ma
terial on both the varsity and freshman
teams, and is looked forward to with a
great deal of interest.
Captain Morris Korksey and Willard
Wells, '20, will select the men who are
to compete in the meet, and all who
intend to entcrshould hand in their entry
at once. Anyone who has ever donned
a pair of shoes of any description is
urged to enter the meet. Fraternity
houses and all living groups on the
campus are urged to co-operate to make
the Irish Marathon a success.
One of the most interesting features
of the day will be a show by the hold
overs. Milton Bulkley, who has written
many humorous skits, is chairman of the
play committee, so enthusiasts can look
to seeing a fitting revival of the custom.
This show will be staged by the best
talent in the hold-over ranks.
In the Marathon It appears that the
present first-year class should make x a
very fair showing. George and Tliur
nian Clark, who have figured among the
best in former high school meets, will
make a strong bid for non-varsity hon
ors. Kenny Wright will run for the
seniors. He has made good time in the
quarter mile event and may pick off the
medal offered by the Quadrangle Club
for best varsity time.
The success of the Marathon depends
on the turn-out in the various classes,
and it is up to every man who has ever
run before, who thinks he might last
through the quarter mile, to come out
and try for the team. The race will be
run on the relay plan, each class run
ning. an entry for each lap over the six
mile course.
