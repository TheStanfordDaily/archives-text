# ARMY FILM PICTURES FIGHTING CONDITIONS
## Movies of Over Seas Action Will Be Shown in Assembly Hall Friday and Saturday 
### 
The army film showing actual fight
ing action in France which will be
shown in the Assembly Hall, Friday
and Saturday evenings, February 18,
19, should be interesting to those who
did not participate in the fighting
over seas, because it presents more
accurately than any picture yet shown
fighting conditions in France, while
for those who were members of the
91st, 2d, and 42d divisions in France
a large element of interest lies in the
possibility of picking themselves out
in one or another of the scenes. One
of the scenes shows an actual fight
between a German plane and an Amer
ican balloon protected by a barrage of
anti-tank guns. The German finally
maneuvers into a position from which
he makes a nose dive straight at the
balloon and sets it on fire, the Amer
ican leaping from the balloon with his
parachute and safely alighting. The
German plane, however, is finally
brought down to the ground after a
good deal of stunts failing in his at
tempt to avoid shell fire. The Amer
ican soldiers gather around the Ger
man as he is carried off for treatment.
This is no staged "aerial battle" but
a picture of the real thing.
Another thrilling episode presents
the engineers of the 42d routing the
enemy out of their hiding place in a
neck of the woods during the Chateau
Thierry battle. In this scene the
Americans are shown hurling hand
grenades and those who see the pic
ture wonder how the photographer
who took it had the nerve to stand his
ground under the German gun fire
and can readily believe that 16 men
lost their lives before the film was
completed, as the case actually was.
