# COACHES WOULD GIVE CIRCLE BLOCK 'S' TO GYMNASTIC TEAM
## 
### 
A movement to give members of
the Stanford Gymnasium Team a
Circle Block "S" has been started by
the coaches of the various sports. A
petition has been prepared and sub
mitted to the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Pennsyl
vania and most of the Eastern Uni
versities grant a letter for distinguish
ed work on the Gym team. Some of
the large colleges award the varsity
block letter to the gym menâ€”the
same thing that the football men get.
The coaches of the recognized
sports believe that good work on the
Gym team should get recognition.
Granting a letter will be a great
stimulus to the activity, is their
opinion. Coach Maloney says that
the more men we have competing for
the gym team, the better our other
athletics will be. His idea is that a
man is more apt to "discover himself"
by this system. The minor sports
are a rich source of material for the
major sports, he says.
The petition is given below:
"We, the undersigned, petition the
Board of Athletic Control to grant a
Circle Block "S" to those men who
have qualified for the gymnastic team.
It is understood that the members of
the gymnastic team who receive this
Circle Block "S" are to be recom
mended by the coach on the basis of
service and ability in exhibition.
"We believe this would be an in
centive toward the development of
an activity which is now recognized
by the majority of the large colleges
and universities in the United States."
