# Tabby, Pet of Three Campus Groups Meets Death Beneath Wheels Of Speeding Machine
## 
### 
Hard luck has crossed the path of
at least three of the campus living
groups. A large black cat (gender
unknown) has ceased to exist due to
the ministrations of somebody's auto
mobile or truck. The cat has been
the property of Beta Theta Pi during
the last year, but was also claimed
by the Thetas and Fijis. Now all are
grieving their loss.
During the feline's life it was the
cause of some heated disputes as to
just who owned it, but when its
thread of life was so rudely severed,
no one would claim the honor of ad
ministering the last rites. The duty
devolved upon the house and grounds
committee of the Beta house, near
where the cat met its intimely end.
Flowers today adorn the grave of
the deceased and a raptajn
of the scullery vows bitter revenge
upon the perpetrator of the deed which
ended all nine existences of the cat
at once.
