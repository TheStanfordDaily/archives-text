## Coach Murphy's Men Ready to Go Through Final Tests Before Meeting Berkeley 
### 
Coach Murphy's protegees are to
take part in a boxing tournament to
be held in the local gymnasium on
the night of February 11. Every bout
should prove to be a hard contested
fight as the outcome of each match
will render the winner a place on the
squad.
The men to take part in these bouts
and their respective weights are: 118
lbs., K. Sapiro vs. Brad Simmons;
128 lbs., Mike Hodges vs. Howard
Brown, and G. Rowland vs. Morris
Mode; 138 lbs., Jimmie Ross vs. Gay
Hensold, and J. H. Smith vs. Bob

bout will be in effect an exhibition

in the heavyweight class will mix
with Jim Arthur, a freshman.
The feature bout of the evening
should be when Mark Evans and
Husky Wassum tangle. Last year
Mark Evans took on Husky Wassum
to determine the championship of the
school in this weight. Young Wassum
broke his hand in the first round but
with tins disability put up a good
fight. Wassum was then a novice in
the four-round game but this year it
is expected that Mark Evans will find
him a tough proposition.
The Babe Henry-Kennedy battle
phould come up to all expectations.
This is Babe's first fight in the light
heavyweight class, while Kennedy has
always averaged this weight and with
his speed and shiftiness should give
Henry competent opposition.

chosen for the varsity squad will start
intensive training for the California-
Stanford contest which is to take
place at Berkeley on March 11.
