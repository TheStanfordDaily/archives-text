# NEW REGULATIONS ON SCHOLARSHIP ARE ANNOUNCED
## Committee Changes System; Only Grade Points Will Be Considered in Future Rating 
### 
The Committee on Scholarship has
changed the regulations concerning the
general average that students must
maintain; in the future only grade
points will be considered. Heretofore
the averages have been determined by
hours, grade points, and counts.
The new plan will make it easier for
a student to get off probation. Under
the old plan extra »hours and grade
points were required to equal those lost,
while now the grade points alone must
be made up.
Mid-quarter probations, failures, and
disqualifications are to be eliminated.
The usual notices of the courses in
which a student is deficient will be sent
out. One effect of this will be that ath
letes will not be disqualified from play
ing in the middle of a quarter just be
fore a game. This will also mean, how
ever, that men going in for athletics
will have to watch their step or be
caught up at the end of the quarter.
The committee believes that too much
emphasis can be placed on mid-quarter
examinations and reports, and it is
hoped by them that the change will lead
to more continuity of class work during
the quarter.
The whole idea of the change has
been simplification, and it was found
that this could be accomplished without
varying the results obtained by the pres
ent "rules. The number of students dis
qualified or put on probation will re
main about the same. The change in no
way affects the regulations concerning
the amount of work required each quar
ter. — 1
