# FEBRUARY CARDINAL TO APPEAR ON QUAD FOR SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning the February
issue of the Stanford Cardinal will be
placed on sale on the Quad, being the
first of the campus magazines to be
published this month. The Cardinal
in its February issue is not playing
up any special article or story but is
presenting a number marked by varie
ty of interest. By its well-selected
stories, articles, verse, and particularly
its pictures, the Cardinal has suc
ceeded in presenting an issue of
balanced appeal.
The printing of a full page cut of
Jack London was made possible by
the permission of the widow of the
California author. A special book
plate used by London is accompanied
by verse contributed by Robin Lamp
son. An unusual picture of the Mid
night Sun contained in tliÂ£ issue was
made from a photograph recently
brought from Alaska by a Stanford
student.
The two editorials of the number,
"Looking Toward the Future," and
"Revitalizing the Stanford Union,"
are certain to provoke interest. A
short article on the labor situation is
a resume of the latest developments
in the controversy between labor and
capital.
The three short stories published
will justify the attempt of the editor
to present the forthcoming issue as
a short story number. Verse is con
tributed by Archie Binns and Robin
Lampson. -.Ks.Un-
