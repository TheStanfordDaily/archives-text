# RAM'S HEAD TO HOLD REIGN ON CAMPOS TONIGHT
## Curtain to Raise at 8: 15 For Society's Luring Musical Farce; Dance After Show 
### 
The Ram's Head Dramatic Society
will present their annual play to the
campus .and public in the Assembly Hall
this evening. The curtain will rise at
8:15 sharp, with the opening chorus,
"Men." â€¢
The songs and dances will be accom
panied by an orchestra made up of the
best talent the campus has to offer, un
der the competent direction of Tommy
Reynolds. Myron Iligby, who com
posed some of the lyrics in the score,
will be at the piano.
The parts offer many nationjalities
ranging from the 'blase Englishman to
the sentimental Italian. Variety, in fact,
is the keynote of the play. Love scenes
and sob stuff give way to laugh-tickling
farce.
Coach Lester Seib has worked hard
with his material and is confident that
they will put a play over the footlights
tonight that will come up to, if not ex
ceed, any Ram's Head show of the
past.
Most of the comedy stuff in the show
comes in the characterization by boys of
the girls' parts in the show. It may be
stated that the entire cast and chorus is
made up of men, though some may doubt
this when they see to-night's perform
ance, as some of the parts are t&ken
with unbelievable grace and naturalness.
Stage settings will be another feature
of the play. The greater part of the
play takes part in a cave. Scenic effects
for this have been worked out by Col
man Stewart. With the limited mate
rial which the Assembly Hall offers, a
natural effect has been hard to obtain.
A few seats are still unsold and will
be on sale at the box office tonight.
