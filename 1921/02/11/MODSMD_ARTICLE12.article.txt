# VARSITY AND FRESHMEN QUINTETS TO TANGLE WITH BLUE AND GOLD TEAMS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW EVENING
## Coach Powell's Basketball Squad is Ready for Crucial Game at Harmon Gymnasium 
### 
Coach Powell and the Stanford varsity basketball team went to Ber
keley yesterday where they will engage the California Bruin Five in tho
first game of the final drive for the Pacific Coast Conference title tonight.
The quintet worked out in Harmon Gymnasium yesterday afternoon and
after resting today they should be in fine fettle for the contest tonight.
Powell is confident that the Cardinal will beat at Bruin aggregation
tonight. All of the men are in exceptionally good condition and they
realize the imperativeness of defeating the Berkeleyites. This game will
go a long way toward determining the title-holder in both the Conference
and the California-Nevada League. In the latter association California and
Stanford both have unblemished records, while Stanford is the undisputed
leader in the Pacific Coast Conference with four victories. California has
won three games and lost one for a percentage of .750.
After witnessing the first game ofthe Stanford-Washington series in
Encina Gymnasium last Monday night, Coach Wight and the Bruin varsity
have worked out a plan to offset thetype of play used by the Cardinal
warriors and they expect to hand themen from the farm a defeat to take
north with them.

Wight will start his star forwards,
Coop and Captain Jack SymeH, with
Jeff Larkey playing center. The de
fensive end of the court is to be hand
led by Eggleston and Le Hane. This
is the combination that has been so
successful for the Blue and Gold this
season.
Opposing this outfit Coach Powell
will start "Swede" Righter and Jimmy
Davies as forwards with Bert Mills
doing the free goal shooting and car
ing for center. Captain Adams and
Dick Richmond will play guards.'
Following the game tonight both
teams will depart for the north where
they will play four games. Stanford
will have the hardest games in the
northland. Washington State College
and the University of Washington will
oppose the Cardinal, while the Bruins
meet the University of Oregon and
the Oregon Aggies. The Aggies have
yet to win a game in the Conference
and the Oregon team has won but
half of its contests.
The purple and gold aggregation
from the University of Washington
lost three out of four games played
when it invaded California this week
but every one of the three were hard
fought and decided only in the last
few minutes of play. On their own
court they are figured to make Stan
ford step some to repeat. The Cou
gars of Washington State have been
having a very successful season and
according to word of the Washington
players they are formidable contend
ers for coast laurels.
More than four hundred rooters will
invade Berkeley tonightt to support
the Powellites. The game is sched
uled to start at 8 o'clock.
Manager "Wash" Connolly has an
nounced the personnel of the squad
that will go north as follows: "Swede"
Righter, Jimmy Davies, Lefty Rod
gers, Dick Richmond, Bert Mills, Cap
tain Adams, Fred Anderson. Ralph
Carver and Coach Powell. •

court they are figured to make Stan
ford step some to repeat. The Cou
gars of Washington State have been
having a very successful season and
according to word of the Washington
players they are formidable contend
ers for coast laurels.
More than four hundred rooters will
invade Berkeley tonightt to support
the Powellites. The game is sched
uled to start at 8 o'clock.
Manager "Wash" Connolly has an
nounced the personnel of the squad
that will go north as follows: "Swede"
Righter, Jimmy Davies, Lefty Rod
gers, Dick Richmond, Bert Mills, Cap
tain Adams, Fred Anderson. Ralph
Carver and Coach Powell. •
The team returned to the campus to
day to attend classes, but left again
this afternoon for the Berkeley campus.
Coach Powell and the Stanford varsity basketball team went to Ber
keley yesterday where they will engage the California Bruin Five in tho
first game of the final drive for the Pacific Coast Conference title tonight.
The quintet worked out in Harmon Gymnasium yesterday afternoon and
after resting today they should be in fine fettle for the contest tonight.
Powell is confident that the Cardinal will beat at Bruin aggregation
tonight. All of the men are in exceptionally good condition and they
realize the imperativeness of defeating the Berkeleyites. This game will
go a long way toward determining the title-holder in both the Conference
and the California-Nevada League. In the latter association California and
Stanford both have unblemished records, while Stanford is the undisputed
leader in the Pacific Coast Conference with four victories. California has
won three games and lost one for a percentage of .750.
After witnessing the first game ofthe Stanford-Washington series in
Encina Gymnasium last Monday night, Coach Wight and the Bruin varsity
have worked out a plan to offset thetype of play used by the Cardinal
warriors and they expect to hand themen from the farm a defeat to take
north with them.

Wight will start his star forwards,
Coop and Captain Jack SymeH, with
Jeff Larkey playing center. The de
fensive end of the court is to be hand
led by Eggleston and Le Hane. This
is the combination that has been so
successful for the Blue and Gold this
season.
Opposing this outfit Coach Powell
will start "Swede" Righter and Jimmy
Davies as forwards with Bert Mills
doing the free goal shooting and car
ing for center. Captain Adams and
Dick Richmond will play guards.'
Following the game tonight both
teams will depart for the north where
they will play four games. Stanford
will have the hardest games in the
northland. Washington State College
and the University of Washington will
oppose the Cardinal, while the Bruins
meet the University of Oregon and
the Oregon Aggies. The Aggies have
yet to win a game in the Conference
and the Oregon team has won but
half of its contests.
The purple and gold aggregation
from the University of Washington
lost three out of four games played
when it invaded California this week
but every one of the three were hard
fought and decided only in the last
few minutes of play. On their own
court they are figured to make Stan
ford step some to repeat. The Cou
gars of Washington State have been
having a very successful season and
according to word of the Washington
players they are formidable contend
