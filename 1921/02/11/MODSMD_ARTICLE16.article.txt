# IN CLOSING
## 
### 
With this issue Volume 58 comes to a close, and on Monday Volume
59 of The Daily Palo Alto makes its appearance under tlie direction of
the new editor.
Volume 58 has seen The Daily pass through a critical stage of its
development, and at present it appears that the paper will be able to
through the spring and be in excellent condition for the opening
quarter next fall. While all of the city papers have just announced a
raise in their rates, and countless of the smaller dailies have suspended
publication, it is a matter of pride to note that with the co-operation of
the editorial and business staffs expenses have been cut down to a
minimum, a fact which accounts for the present improvement in the
financial conditions of the paper.
1 his volume has also seen the growth of a new feature in college
dailies, the exchange of intercollegiate news. This has developed into
an important feature during its short existence, and in the future it will
be the means of bringing universities much closer together, and eliminat
ing much of the narrow-mindedness which the college student is gener
ally afflicted with. University student bodies are finding that they have
too much in common to be separated by prejudices, and that each should*
know what problems the other is facing, and how they are solved. The
intercollegiate news service will play an important part in this field as
time passes. Its value is shown by the fact that two such services have
already been formed in the West, and a third one is proposed. The Daily
Palo Alto is fortunate in being a member of the first of these associations
to be formed.
Iti line with this policy to make the college student a better informed
person, condensed news dispatches of world happenings played an im
portant part in the news section of this paper during the past term.
1 his service was finally suspended because of its cost, but it will un
doubtedly be resumed when finances warrant it. University students
have to be taught to read outside news, and when they do learn to read
it, they will come to regard it as one of the most valuable features in a
college daily.
As the official student body publication, it is the duty of* The Daily
Palo Alto to s})onsor all worthy movements, and to attempt to correct
any evils that may be present. Such was the aim of The Daily during
the past term. Whether it was successful or not must be left to the
students for determination.
Under the guidance of the incoming editor, The Daily Palo Alto
will without doubt adhere to the high standards it has always had, and
continue to be a credit to Stanford.
