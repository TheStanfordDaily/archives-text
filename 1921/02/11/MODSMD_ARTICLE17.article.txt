# HENRY LANZ, BUILDER OF THE SLAVIC DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
The introduction and development of
a Slavic Department at Stanford is
largely due to the efforts of Professor
Henry Lanz. Coming to Palo Alto in
the beginning of 1917, Professor Lanz
started a private class in the Russian
language at the University with only
seven students, and in the fall of the
same year he was appointed by the Uni
versity to teach the Russian language
and literature. The number of students
interested in the subject was continually
growing with every quarter, and at the
same time the Slavic question »was
moved to the foreground of interna
tional politics.
The end of the war resulted in the
formation of several Slavic States, and
to meet the very natural interest of the
public and particularly of the students
toward these new-born nations, Profes
sor Lanz decided to start a course in
Slavic Literatures in general. At the
present time the average registration in
the Slavic Department approaches thirty
to one hundred students. Professor
Lanz is now assisting one of his stu
dents in the translation of the most
significant and interesting poems from
the classical period of Russian literature,
and he sees in them a valuable contri
bution to the existing collections of Rus
sian poetry in the English language.
Professor Lanz was born in Moscow,
but his father was a naturalized Amer
ican citizfli, and he has never applied
for Russian citizenship. He received his
high school and college training in Rus
sia, which he considers a country of re
markable natural and spiritual resources.
Professor Lanz's fatlier, who left Russia

because of opposition to the qld regime,
belonged to a very old family of the
aristocracy, being a third cousin of Leo
Tolstoy, but Lanz, Sr., was entirely op
posed to any expression of aristocratic
sentimenf an«l brought his children up
to strictly ideals.
Upon completion of two years' work
in Moscow University, Professor Lanz
left Russia to study in Germany. He
received a Ph.D. (magna cum laude)
from the University of Heidelberg in
1911 and went to Marbury to do research
work in the history of philosophy. Dur
ing this time Professor Lanz published
several articles both in the German and
Russian languages. In 1912 his book on
"The Problem of Objectivity in Modern
Logic" appeared and. was followed by
several articles on similar rsubjects. On
returning to Moscow, Professor Lanz
was appointed instructor of logic in the
Reform College and lecturer on aesthet
ics in the Musical Conservatory. In
1914 he returned to Germany to finish
research work on a book he was writing
on the History of Philosophy, but was
forced to leave there when the war
broke out. He made his way to Eng
land and from there, as an American
citizen, could obtain a passport to no
other place but the LTnited States. »
Four years of close contact with the
schools and educational system of this
country has brovlftht him to the conclu
sion that its education and life in gen
eral is a good school for all Europeans,
and especially Russians, and he is look
ing forward with confidence to the fu
ture co-operation of both countries,
economically and in literature.

to one hundred students. Professor
Lanz is now assisting one of his stu
dents in the translation of the most
significant and interesting poems from
the classical period of Russian literature,
and he sees in them a valuable contri
bution to the existing collections of Rus
sian poetry in the English language.
Professor Lanz was born in Moscow,
but his father was a naturalized Amer
ican citizfli, and he has never applied
for Russian citizenship. He received his
high school and college training in Rus
sia, which he considers a country of re
markable natural and spiritual resources.
Professor Lanz's fatlier, who left Russia

because of opposition to the qld regime,
belonged to a very old family of the
aristocracy, being a third cousin of Leo
Tolstoy, but Lanz, Sr., was entirely op
posed to any expression of aristocratic
sentimenf an«l brought his children up
to strictly ideals.
Upon completion of two years' work
in Moscow University, Professor Lanz
left Russia to study in Germany. He
received a Ph.D. (magna cum laude)
from the University of Heidelberg in
1911 and went to Marbury to do research
work in the history of philosophy. Dur
ing this time Professor Lanz published
several articles both in the German and
Russian languages. In 1912 his book on
"The Problem of Objectivity in Modern
Logic" appeared and. was followed by
several articles on similar rsubjects. On
returning to Moscow, Professor Lanz
was appointed instructor of logic in the
Reform College and lecturer on aesthet
ics in the Musical Conservatory. In
1914 he returned to Germany to finish
research work on a book he was writing
on the History of Philosophy, but was
forced to leave there when the war
broke out. He made his way to Eng
land and from there, as an American
citizen, could obtain a passport to no
other place but the LTnited States. »
Four years of close contact with the
schools and educational system of this
country has brovlftht him to the conclu
sion that its education and life in gen
eral is a good school for all Europeans,
and especially Russians, and he is look
ing forward with confidence to the fu
ture co-operation of both countries,
economically and in literature.
The introduction and development of
a Slavic Department at Stanford is
largely due to the efforts of Professor
Henry Lanz. Coming to Palo Alto in
the beginning of 1917, Professor Lanz
started a private class in the Russian
language at the University with only
seven students, and in the fall of the
same year he was appointed by the Uni
versity to teach the Russian language
and literature. The number of students
interested in the subject was continually
growing with every quarter, and at the
same time the Slavic question »was
moved to the foreground of interna
tional politics.
The end of the war resulted in the
formation of several Slavic States, and
to meet the very natural interest of the
public and particularly of the students
toward these new-born nations, Profes
sor Lanz decided to start a course in
Slavic Literatures in general. At the
present time the average registration in
the Slavic Department approaches thirty
to one hundred students. Professor
Lanz is now assisting one of his stu
dents in the translation of the most
