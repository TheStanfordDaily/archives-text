# MEDIC FIVE DEFEATS ENCINA BULL PEN IN SEMI-FINAL BATTLE
## 
### 
That Stanford fight is not confined
to varsity contests was shown yester
day afternoon when the Medics won
a stubbornly disputed game from the
fast Encina Bull Pen quintet, 10 to 6.
This was the first of two extra games
made necessary by a three-cornered
tie for championship of League Seven
in the preliminary intramural series.
Superior team work won for the
Medics. They held the lead through
most of the game, but were so hard
pressed by the Hall men that a let
up at any time would have reversed
their fortune. The game was played
on the large court. Both teams were
well supported by rooters.
Cunningham scored the first point
of the game for the Bull Pen, throwing
on a penalty.
Love came back with a basket for
the Medics almost immediately. The
fight was even throughout the first
half, the Medics getting a few more
shots than their opponents. Guarding
was so close on both sides that most
of the shots were inaccurate, and the
scoring was light. The half ended in
a 4 to 4 tie.
The first half showed the Medics
that Love could outjump the Bull Pen
center, Fehren. They came back in
the second half with some well-plan
ned plays, and by good team work,
managed pradually to draw away from
the Encina men.
Burkhart at forward played a stel
lar game for the winners. He scored
most of their points, and was good
at getting down the field for free
shots. Fernish did some fast work for
the doctors at forward. * w* «•*
Cunningham at running goard was
the luminous star of the Bull Pen
quintet. He scored all the points made
by the Oaks. Fehren fought hard
straight hrough the game, though
playing against the taller center.
Wassum and Walker put up a fast
game, but were too closely guarded
to score the points counted on from
them by the Bull Pen fans. Files
made a good showing at guard, though
at a disadvantage in playing against
heavier men. Koehler, Strauss and
Nelson went in for the Encina team
in the second half. In the last few
minutes Grothe went in and with
Koehler put on a good exhibition of
team work. W. E. Starkey refereed.
