Falls Dead While Combing Hair. Try
Glover's sheep dip.
He clasped her to his heart, his own,
His ecstasy no tongue could speak,

That moment he'd have scorned a
throne,
When in his ear,
His love, his dear,
Said, "What's your wages, Bob, a
week?"
* * »
Don't wofry about your reputation.
It'll be rosy when yoq die. Even that
feline, now defunct, whicli was owned
by half the Row, is being extoled to
the skies, despite the knowledge that
it was the source of uncouth music
at un-Christian hours.

Little Jack Ginn sat in the Lnn,
Eating a hamburger steak.
The unlucky glutton
Choked on a button
And shouted, "I've made a mistake."

So the co-eds of Illinois University
are planting the ban on cigarettes?
Looks lige a boomerang ban, judgnig
by the retaliatory measures adopted
by the masculine element of the In
stitution to defeat the co-eds' pur
poses. Looks to us as though the
Eastern gents are taking poor mea
sures. Their ban will call for ye old
fashiond depravity of style and make
a worse reaction than ever.
