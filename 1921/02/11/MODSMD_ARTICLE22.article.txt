# MAY PETERSON GIVES DELIGHTFUL PROGRAM
## Metropolitan Soprano Pleases In Operatic Numbers and Variety of Light Songs 
### (By MARY JANE CLARK, '22 
May Peterson, herself delightfully
charming, is an artist, possessing a
voice notable for its lyric beauty and
clarity of technique. The songs which
she sang in her concert in the As
sembly Hall last evening were en
tirely in harmony with the personality
of the singer and brought out the
grace and delicacy of her voice.
The numbers were all of a more or
less light, poetic nature, forming a
series of delicate and imaginative
sketches. The histronic requirements
were not neglected, a number of the
songs being vividly dramatic, and
many of them were distinctly beauti
ful in tenderness of appeal.
The "Aria" from Mozart's "Le Nozze
di Figaro" with which Miss Peterson
opened her program, together with
the "Momus" aria from "La Lutte
Entre Phoebus et Pan" of Bach, and
Messager's "Jamais la Vielle Maison
Grise" from "Fortunio" comprised
the operatic selections. These were
all sung with a sufficient apprecia
tion of their dralnatic nature, but
without destroying the light graceful
character of the program. The old
English song, "Oh, No John" was a
playful little number winning instant
response. "L'Heure Delicieuse" and
Dvorak's "Song's My Mother Taught
Me," were the most well received of
the second group of songs, the well
known Dvorak composition being par
ticularly beautiful.
Miss Peterson's next selections in
cluded an old Swedish folk dance, a
Russian folk song, and an old Scotch
song, which with the old English and
old French-Canadian songs in the first
part of the program as well as a negro
spiritual, formed a rather unusual va
riety of charming folk songs. As an
encore Miss Peterson sang the alwavs
loved "Carry Me Back to Old Virginia."
Among the closing numbers were a
musical adaptation of Eugene Field's
poem, "Come Hither, Little Child,"
"Snowflakes," "Just Before the Lights
Are Lit," and "Love Is the Wind," a
most appealing and delightful little
group of songs.
I As a final encore Miss Peterson,
playing her own accompaniment, sang
the "Echo Song" made famous by
Jenny Lind, and "Comin' Through
the Rye."
