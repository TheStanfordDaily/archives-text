Happiness is restored in the Ma
loney household. Coach Harry has
overcome the mumps, and is back in
Encina Gym. No longer does Mrs.

'phoii3 calls asking when the Sequoia
Soccer team plays Encina First, or
inquiring where the Rugby meu's
shoes are. k ,
Harry seems glad to be back. " "I
never 'ave spent such a restless week
in my life, never!" he declares.
"I pray heaven he may. never be
sick again" avers Mrs. Maloney. "I
never dreamed one man could be so
much in the way about the house."
