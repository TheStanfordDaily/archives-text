# Junior Class Gives First Dance After Game Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
The Junior Dance tomorrow night in
the Women's Clubhouse will start at 9
o'clock, so as to give time for every
body to see the Freshmen battle the
U. C. Babes in the opening game of
the series with California.
Music will be furnished by a five-piece
orchestra with Grinstead at the piano;
Tex Mertz and Lewie Alabaster, saxa
phone; Homer Mitchell, banjo; and A1
Carrey on the traps. They have been
practicing together and will offer a mean
variety of synocopation.
Decorations will be simple, but the
lighting effect in the clubhouse will be
changed for the dance. The fee for the
evening's entertainment will be one dol
lar coin or currency.
