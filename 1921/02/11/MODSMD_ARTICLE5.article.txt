# STANFORD AXE MAY RETURN TO FARM AS PRIZE FOR ATHLETICS
## 
### 
The coveted Stanford Axe, captured
by the Berkeleyans nearly two de
cades ago, and now reposing in a safe
deposu \auli, a little further
home with the announcement that
Judge Everett Brown, who was chiefly
responsible for its capture, favors
putting the relic up for competition
between the two universities. The
proposal was made some time ago
that the axe should leave its haven
of safety and should pass back and
forth, as a reward for athletic sup
remacy.
If the plan goes through there will
be more interest added to the already
intense rivalry between the Cardinal
and the Blue and Gold. Jn addition,
Stanford will be enable to regain
possession of the captured trophy, and
install it in a place of honor, where it
will remain until California is able to
wrest it away by a victotry in ath
letics Opinion around the bay, both
of Berkeley students and the general
public, seems to be that the proposed
plan would be beneficial all around.
