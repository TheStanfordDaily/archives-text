# FACULTY FAVORS INSTALLATION OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
## Letters Received from Various Departments Congratulating Honor Plan Committee 
### 
Letters from the Departments of
Mining and Metallurgy, Geology, Phi
losophy, Law, and others have been
received today assuring the committee
appointed by Floyd McElroy, '21, to
investigate the possibilities of in
stalling an honor system at Stanford,
that the faculty, as far as these de
partments are concerned at least, is
in flavor of the installment of such a
system. These departments have been
using the honor system in recitation
and examination for a considerable
time and are thoroughly convinced
of its advisability, the Geology De
partment having operated unofficially
under their plan since 1892.
A letter from President Wilbur to
the President of Dartmouth Univer
sity congratulating him on the in
stallation of the system at that uni
versity, and expressing the hope of
such a systems installation here, has
been referred to the committee. Pre
sident Wilbur mentions the operation
of the idea in the Law and Chemistry
Departments at Stanford as very en
couraging and says that he is con
vinced that the trial will be a success.
The following is a copy of the Presi
dent's letter:
Mr. F. G. Norstrand,
42 North Massachusetts Hall,
Hanover, N. H.
Dear Mr. Norstrand: —In response
to your letter of January 22d, which
I found upon my desk upon my return
from the east, I am glad to give you
my opinion on the so-called honor
system.
I think that one of the proudest
achievements in American education
is the success of the honor system in
effect at Princeton University. What
Princeton can do certainly Dartmouth
can. and so, incidentally, can Stan
ford, when enough time has elapsed
for the necessary education. The
least thought would lead every hon
est college man to feel that there
should be no members of the alumni
association who have earned their de
gree by fraud. Every degree so earn
ed causes a distinct loss to the holder
of every degree. In such a mutually
co-operative body as a university there
should be no room for fraud of any
sort. The great difficulty is that any
honor system requires the united back
ing of a large proportion of the re
turning students in any given year.
With the necessary assimilation each
year of new students gathered from
all kinds of educational institutions
there is great difficulty in devising a
workable honor system. An honor
system that is a source of hypocrisy
is the greatest blight that can come
to any student body. I think the way
to make such a system successful is
to have the student appoint the neces
sary committees and to serve notice
upon students violating the rules of
the university that they shall leave
at once without any unusual ceremony.
If the students themselves send a
committee around to tell their fellow
student, who has been cheating, that
he belongs somewhere else, it does
not take long to put an honor system
into effect and there is no need of
"telling the teacher." *
I am sending you a copy of a re
port made to me by Dean Huston of
the Stanford Law School, where the
honor system is now in use here at
Stanford. It indicates the particular
conditions that have made the honor
system a success in that department. I
understand that a similar plan is suc
cessful in the Chemistry Department
of the University.
I am looking forward earnestly to
the day when the men of Stanford will
themselves come forward with the
proposal to put a genuine honor sys
tem into effect. I hope that you will
he successful at Dartmouth. It may
help us here.
Very sincerely yours,
R. L. WILBUR. President.
The Mining and Metallurgy Depart
ment sent this letter to H. A. Brown,
one of the men on the committee:
Mr. H. A. Brown,
No. 6, Lasuen St., Stanford Campus.
Dear Sir: —The honor system has
been exclusively in use in this depart
ment for two years. We place com
plete trust in the students registered
in the department, at the same time
believing that any man who betrays
that trust damages himself alone. It
may annoy an instructor to have such
an insult placed on his intelligence,
but it does not harm the instructor
or the department.
Yours very truly,
THEODORE J. HOOVER,
Executive Head, Department of
Mining and Metallurgy.
The letter from the Geology Depart
ment is as follows:
M. H. A. Brown,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Mr. Brown: The honor system
has been in operation in the Department
of Geology, informally and unofficially,
since 1892, especially in the upper class
es. Students have been put on their
honor just as they would in a family,
and the results are satisfactory. The
upper classmen have taken it upon
themselves to direct and discipline the
younger men, and we have never heard
any complaint from them, nor from any
instructors, of the existence of cheating
in the upper classes.
We have trusted the men with the
same freedom that we give to our fami
lies, and with the same gratifying re
sults, of mutual confidence, justified by
the outcome. We assume that they
are gentlemen and have not been disap
pointed.

The following is a copy of the Presi
dent's letter:
Mr. F. G. Norstrand,
42 North Massachusetts Hall,
Hanover, N. H.
Dear Mr. Norstrand: —In response
to your letter of January 22d, which
I found upon my desk upon my return
from the east, I am glad to give you
my opinion on the so-called honor
system.
I think that one of the proudest
achievements in American education
is the success of the honor system in
effect at Princeton University. What
Princeton can do certainly Dartmouth
can. and so, incidentally, can Stan
ford, when enough time has elapsed
for the necessary education. The
least thought would lead every hon
est college man to feel that there
should be no members of the alumni
association who have earned their de
gree by fraud. Every degree so earn
ed causes a distinct loss to the holder
of every degree. In such a mutually
co-operative body as a university there
should be no room for fraud of any
sort. The great difficulty is that any
honor system requires the united back
ing of a large proportion of the re
turning students in any given year.
With the necessary assimilation each
year of new students gathered from
all kinds of educational institutions
there is great difficulty in devising a
workable honor system. An honor
system that is a source of hypocrisy
is the greatest blight that can come
to any student body. I think the way
to make such a system successful is
to have the student appoint the neces
sary committees and to serve notice
upon students violating the rules of
the university that they shall leave
at once without any unusual ceremony.
If the students themselves send a
committee around to tell their fellow
student, who has been cheating, that
he belongs somewhere else, it does
not take long to put an honor system
into effect and there is no need of
"telling the teacher." *
I am sending you a copy of a re
port made to me by Dean Huston of
the Stanford Law School, where the
honor system is now in use here at
Stanford. It indicates the particular
conditions that have made the honor
system a success in that department. I
understand that a similar plan is suc
cessful in the Chemistry Department
of the University.
I am looking forward earnestly to
the day when the men of Stanford will
themselves come forward with the
proposal to put a genuine honor sys
tem into effect. I hope that you will
he successful at Dartmouth. It may
help us here.
Very sincerely yours,
R. L. WILBUR. President.
The Mining and Metallurgy Depart
ment sent this letter to H. A. Brown,
one of the men on the committee:
Mr. H. A. Brown,
No. 6, Lasuen St., Stanford Campus.
Dear Sir: —The honor system has
been exclusively in use in this depart
ment for two years. We place com
plete trust in the students registered
in the department, at the same time
believing that any man who betrays
that trust damages himself alone. It
may annoy an instructor to have such
an insult placed on his intelligence,
but it does not harm the instructor
or the department.
Yours very truly,
THEODORE J. HOOVER,
Executive Head, Department of
Mining and Metallurgy.
The letter from the Geology Depart
ment is as follows:
M. H. A. Brown,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Mr. Brown: The honor system
has been in operation in the Department
of Geology, informally and unofficially,
since 1892, especially in the upper class
es. Students have been put on their
honor just as they would in a family,
and the results are satisfactory. The
upper classmen have taken it upon
themselves to direct and discipline the
younger men, and we have never heard
any complaint from them, nor from any
instructors, of the existence of cheating
in the upper classes.
We have trusted the men with the
same freedom that we give to our fami
lies, and with the same gratifying re
sults, of mutual confidence, justified by
the outcome. We assume that they
are gentlemen and have not been disap
pointed.

Letters from the Departments of

ed causes a distinct loss to the holder
of every degree. In such a mutually
co-operative body as a university there
should be no room for fraud of any
sort. The great difficulty is that any
honor system requires the united back
ing of a large proportion of the re
turning students in any given year.
With the necessary assimilation each
year of new students gathered from
all kinds of educational institutions
there is great difficulty in devising a
workable honor system. An honor
system that is a source of hypocrisy
is the greatest blight that can come
to any student body. I think the way
to make such a system successful is
to have the student appoint the neces
sary committees and to serve notice
upon students violating the rules of
the university that they shall leave
at once without any unusual ceremony.
If the students themselves send a
committee around to tell their fellow
student, who has been cheating, that
he belongs somewhere else, it does
not take long to put an honor system
into effect and there is no need of
"telling the teacher." *
I am sending you a copy of a re
port made to me by Dean Huston of
the Stanford Law School, where the
honor system is now in use here at
Stanford. It indicates the particular
conditions that have made the honor
system a success in that department. I
understand that a similar plan is suc
cessful in the Chemistry Department
of the University.
I am looking forward earnestly to
the day when the men of Stanford will
themselves come forward with the
proposal to put a genuine honor sys
tem into effect. I hope that you will
he successful at Dartmouth. It may
help us here.
Very sincerely yours,
R. L. WILBUR. President.
The Mining and Metallurgy Depart
ment sent this letter to H. A. Brown,
one of the men on the committee:
Mr. H. A. Brown,
No. 6, Lasuen St., Stanford Campus.
Dear Sir: —The honor system has
been exclusively in use in this depart
ment for two years. We place com
plete trust in the students registered
in the department, at the same time
believing that any man who betrays
that trust damages himself alone. It
may annoy an instructor to have such
an insult placed on his intelligence,
but it does not harm the instructor
or the department.
Yours very truly,
THEODORE J. HOOVER,
Executive Head, Department of
Mining and Metallurgy.
The letter from the Geology Depart
ment is as follows:
M. H. A. Brown,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Mr. Brown: The honor system
has been in operation in the Department
of Geology, informally and unofficially,
since 1892, especially in the upper class
es. Students have been put on their
honor just as they would in a family,
and the results are satisfactory. The
upper classmen have taken it upon
themselves to direct and discipline the
younger men, and we have never heard
any complaint from them, nor from any
instructors, of the existence of cheating
in the upper classes.
We have trusted the men with the
same freedom that we give to our fami
lies, and with the same gratifying re
sults, of mutual confidence, justified by
the outcome. We assume that they
are gentlemen and have not been disap
pointed.
(Signed) James P. Smith.
