# BABES MEET BRUIN CUBS ON THE LOCAL COURT, SATURDAY
## 
### 
Tomorrow night at 8 p.m. the Babes
meet the California Cub basketers in
the first of the inter-collegiate freshman
games of the season. The freshmen
have defeated all but one of the or
ganizations that have opposed them
through 'the past season and have
swamped most of the opposing teams by
large scores.
Through the preliminary season this
year the first year squad has performed
spasmodically; one game they have gone
well and in the next have played ragged
ly. Injuries to ( Captain Jansen in the
middle of the season broke up the team
work for a week but in th<*last game
the Babes seemed to have come back
all right and were working in first-class
form.
In the one game where the freshmen
%
met defeat, the Berkeley High School,
which won and held the California lirst
year quintet to a 19-13 score in the pre
ceding week. The freshmen did not get
started until the second half, and then
they could not overcome the Jead that
the high school team had gained in the
first period. Right after tiiis defeat the
Babes staged a come-back, though, and
won from Salinas High by a large one
sided score.
A new man has put in an appearance
on the court in the last two days. He
is John ("Scotchy") Campbell. At the
first of the season he showed up as a
good-looker for a guard position on the
five, but had to quit due to studies.
Back again he has showed speed and
class that makes him seem like a sure
thing for tomorrow night's struggle. He
is heavy and that i.s what will count
against the husky team from the regions
of the Blue and Gold.
For the rest it looks like the same
line-up will start as has opened all the
preceding games. McHose and Gran
ger will hold the two forward positions,
with Smith at standing guard and a
choice of A twill, Wittenberg, *and
Campbell for the running-guard posi
tions. Captain Jansen will lead his
team mates at the center job. Jansen
has performed there through the sea
son and has proved the mainstay of the
team. His height and active work on
the iloor, coupled with a good shooting
eye for basket ringing, makes him the
most feared member of the team.
Of the University of California babes,
not much dope is Available for certain.
They are fast and heavy and have run
up large scores against all opposition.
They have one man, Kancaid, at guard
who last year played on the quintet
representing the Los Angeles Athletic
Club in the East when they won the
title there. He is rated as one of the
best defensive men in the basketball
world at the present. To forecast the
outcome of the contest is impossible.
It is only certain that both sides are
out for a victory and will fight until the
last gun.

In the one game where the freshmen
%
met defeat, the Berkeley High School,
which won and held the California lirst
year quintet to a 19-13 score in the pre
ceding week. The freshmen did not get
started until the second half, and then
they could not overcome the Jead that
the high school team had gained in the
first period. Right after tiiis defeat the
Babes staged a come-back, though, and
won from Salinas High by a large one
sided score.
A new man has put in an appearance
on the court in the last two days. He
is John ("Scotchy") Campbell. At the
first of the season he showed up as a
good-looker for a guard position on the
five, but had to quit due to studies.
Back again he has showed speed and
class that makes him seem like a sure
thing for tomorrow night's struggle. He
is heavy and that i.s what will count
against the husky team from the regions
of the Blue and Gold.
For the rest it looks like the same
line-up will start as has opened all the
preceding games. McHose and Gran
ger will hold the two forward positions,
with Smith at standing guard and a
choice of A twill, Wittenberg, *and
Campbell for the running-guard posi
tions. Captain Jansen will lead his
team mates at the center job. Jansen
has performed there through the sea
son and has proved the mainstay of the
team. His height and active work on
the iloor, coupled with a good shooting
eye for basket ringing, makes him the
most feared member of the team.
Of the University of California babes,
not much dope is Available for certain.
They are fast and heavy and have run
up large scores against all opposition.
They have one man, Kancaid, at guard
who last year played on the quintet
representing the Los Angeles Athletic
Club in the East when they won the
title there. He is rated as one of the
best defensive men in the basketball
world at the present. To forecast the
outcome of the contest is impossible.
It is only certain that both sides are
out for a victory and will fight until the
last gun.
Tomorrow night at 8 p.m. the Babes
meet the California Cub basketers in
the first of the inter-collegiate freshman
games of the season. The freshmen
have defeated all but one of the or
ganizations that have opposed them
through 'the past season and have
swamped most of the opposing teams by
large scores.
Through the preliminary season this
year the first year squad has performed
spasmodically; one game they have gone
well and in the next have played ragged
ly. Injuries to ( Captain Jansen in the
middle of the season broke up the team
work for a week but in th<*last game
the Babes seemed to have come back
all right and were working in first-class
form.
