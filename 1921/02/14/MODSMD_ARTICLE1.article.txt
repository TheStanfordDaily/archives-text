# RAM'S HEAD PLAY CLEVERLY STAGED AND INTERPRETED
## "Women" Roles Well Taken; Tom Carskadon and Ned Prather Perfect "Flirty" Girls; Valjean as "Prohi"

Any criticism, no matter how favor
able, would be but an echo of the gen
eral feeling of the campus theater-goers
who saw the Ram's Head musical show
Friday evening. Every clever line and
gesture and every musical number were
received with enthusiasm from an appre
ciative audience. It is no secret that the
campus prefers light comedy to any
other form of dramatics.
The success of the play lay in the
coach, the cast, and the songs. Not
much can be said for the plot, because,
if it had one, it wasn't discovered. How
ever, there was plenty of action and
funny stuff that covered up this de
ficiency.
Dick Pershing did all that could be
done with a part that had so little oppor
tunity to advertise ability. Pershing has
a charming voice and a personality that
showed through even the disadvantages
of a "straight" in a Ram's Head show.
Ardy% Dean gave an apt interpreta
tion of a "sweet, innocent girl," though
he seemed to be having serious diffi
culties in making his pedal extremities
do the proper thing.
Ned Prather, as the baby vamp, and
Dermont Macconel, as the sentimental
Italian, made a good team. Tony won
the vamp with caveman tactics, and
about this time the pair offered a dance
that was clever in its individuality and
originality. Ned Prather sang the song
hit of the show, "It's the Clothes That
Make the Women." Prather's vivacity
and clever "take off" of femininity was
the biggest part of the performance.
