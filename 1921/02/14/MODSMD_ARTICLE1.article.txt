# RAM'S HEAD PLAY CLEVERLY STAGED AND INTERPRETED
## "Women" Roles Well Taken; Tom Carskadon and Ned Prather Perfect "Flirty" Girls; Valjean as "Prohi" 
### (By Melba Berry, '22 
Any criticism, no matter how favor
able, would be but an echo of the gen
eral feeling of the campus theater-goers
who saw the Ram's Head musical show
Friday evening. Every clever line and
gesture and every musical number were
received with enthusiasm from an appre
ciative audience. It is no secret that the
campus prefers light comedy to any
other form of dramatics.
The success of the play lay in the
coach, the cast, and the songs. Not
much can be said for the plot, because,
if it had one, it wasn't discovered. How
ever, there was plenty of action and
funny stuff that covered up this de
ficiency.
Dick Pershing did all that could be
done with a part that had so little oppor
tunity to advertise ability. Pershing has
a charming voice and a personality that
showed through even the disadvantages
of a "straight" in a Ram's Head show.
Ardy% Dean gave an apt interpreta
tion of a "sweet, innocent girl," though
he seemed to be having serious diffi
culties in making his pedal extremities
do the proper thing.
Ned Prather, as the baby vamp, and
Dermont Macconel, as the sentimental
Italian, made a good team. Tony won
the vamp with caveman tactics, and
about this time the pair offered a dance
that was clever in its individuality and
originality. Ned Prather sang the song
hit of the show, "It's the Clothes That
Make the Women." Prather's vivacity
and clever "take off" of femininity was
the biggest part of the performance.
Costumes formed a I>i'k feature in the
show, anil Paul Claflin, as the English
man, was not to he outdone, so on each
appearance he added a new aspect to
his attire by changing the flower in his
buttonhole. This change ranged from
the opening cala lily to the modest bunch
of violets. Claflin added punch to the
usually dry role of an Englishman.
The Professor, played by Hollis Chal
mers. had an educated right hand that
did most of the talking for him. His
change of character from the prosaic to
the sentimental was well done. Thomas
Carskadon, as the Qttoen, worked well
with Chalmers, and their rollicking (?)
dance to the scintillating strains of "It's
a Rich Man's College, After All'' was a
good laugh-tickler.
Jack Heffernan gave us somet'aing
new in the line of Hebrews, and made a
worn-out role interesting. Though he
dropped his vernacular occasionally, he
played one of the most difficult charac
ters in the play with a surety that in
sured its success.
S. H. Mendenhall, with a small part,
made a big laugh out of every line. His
interpretation of a "man hater" was un
excelled.
Lester Seih works for effects, and cer
tainely got them in this play. The
"Sleuth Patrol" was one of them. This
could have been done by no other than
Nelson Valjean, who put all the fun
possible into it.
The poptdar ladies of the cast received
proper tribute from an appreciative audi
ence in the form of elaborate bouquets.
The chorus never failed to get a laugh
at their entrance and a hand at their exit,
and did a great deal to have the Ram's
Head show received as well as it was.
