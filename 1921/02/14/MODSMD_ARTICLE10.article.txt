# DR. GRENFELL TALKS TO LARGE AUDIENCE
## Humanitarian Relates Story of Labrador Relief Work; Contributions Given Fund 
### 
People of Palo Alto and Stanford
showed their deep appreciation and in
terest last evening by filling the Assem
bly Hall to hear the lecture of Sir Wil
fred Grenfell. In simple, direct lan
guage Dr. Grenfell disclosed facts of
his thirty years' experience in the Labra
dor, which held the audience from the
beginning to the end. With the aid of
slides and motion pictures vivid de
scriptions were made of the geograph
ical aspects, the people and the develop
ment of that country. The rock-bound
coasts where the mountains meet the
sea, densely covered with spruce, large
fir, and birch forests, lend a scenic effect
unsurpassed in their beauty. These
mountains divide at intervals to form
picturesque--* fjords who perpendicular
walls nest the wild Eider diifk. The
Grand River, the largest in LabKldor,
makes a 312 foot drop near its base, th&
falls being twice the height of Niagara.
Dr. Grenfell's rirst party of 150 men
found an Anglo-Saxon race speaking
as we do and similar in build. The peo
ple are simple and exceedingly loyal to
their ideals. Christianized, the native
does no fishing on Sundays, even though
food may be needed and a net of fish
is nearby ready to be taken. They are
progressive as well, casting aside tra
ditions, and full of initiative for new
projects. The Medical Mission has been
the leading influence in awakening them
to the realization of the advancement
of which they are capable. Industries
were introduced and the co-operative
store system was laid out. The Yale,
Harvard, and Princeton Medical Units
have assisted in the erection of hos
pitals in a radius of 200 miles from each
other in that district, besides numerous
nursing stations. Ihe relief brought to
these peoples, iced in from the rest of
the world eight months of the year, is
unlimited in value. Not only has Dr.
Grenfell brought health to thousands of
under-nourished children, but he has set
up recreation buildings provided with
amusements to divert the lonely seaman
from the saloons, where the hard-earned
money for the little family was so often
rashly spent.
Donations were received at the door
of the Assembly Hall toward the $1,500,-
000 fund which Dr. Grenfell is raising
to perpetuate the work he has begun.
Mr. W. W. Crocker, of the Crocker Na
tional Bank in San Francisco, is the local
treasurer, and donations may be sent to
him.
