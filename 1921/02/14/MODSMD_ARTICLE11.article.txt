# U. C. DIAMOND SQUAD HAVE HARD PRACTICE
## 
### 
The diamond squad at the University
of California is spending all available
time now in strenuous practice. Coach
Zamlocli made the statement Satur
day afternoon as he watched liis boys
that "California will have su great
hitting team this season."
As his pitching staff is not as strong
as it might be he bases his hopes al
most entirely on Myers, Rowe and
Hermle who, he says, should all hit
over the .300 mark. However, fo;
his other positions he has some very
promising material and jexpects to
turn out an Al team.
