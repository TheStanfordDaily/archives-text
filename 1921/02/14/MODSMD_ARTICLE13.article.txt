# STANFORD LOSES FIRST GAME TO BRUIN QUINTET 30-24, AND BABES ARE DOWNED BY BERKELEY FRESHMEN
## Powell's Men Suffer Reversal Of Form and California Takes Opening Game of Big Series 
### (By Harry J. Borba, '22 
Old Joe Slump hit the Stanford Varsity quintet Saturday night and they
lost their first game this season to California. The score was 30 to 24, and the
game was of the gruelling order, crammed full of action from start to finish.
That there was something radically wrong with the Cardinal quintet was appar
ent from the jump. The players lacked the old fire that has characterized their
work in all the preceding games. This was no doubt due to the two hard games
played with Washington the early part of the week.
Stanford took the lead when Mills converted a foul for the first point.
The Bruin Varsity came right back with a field goal and the battle was on.
The teams see-sawed hack and forth throughout the first period, with first one
team leading and then the other. The score at half time was 13 to 12 in favor
of California.

This did not worry any of the Car
dinal rooters, of whom there were over
four hundred in attendance, as Stanford
has always come from behind to win out
in the last half. But they lacked the
necessary stamina to cinch this game
and gradually lost ground in the final
period. The team went to pieces and
seemed to forget the system that they
had perfected. Meanwhile, the Califor
nians were putting forth every effort to
win he game, and they took advantage
of Stanford's lack of ginger to sneak
over the necessary points.
The old dependable "Swede" Righter
played his usual consistent hall and was
by all odds the star of the game. Four
times Righter took the pellet in the
Yhjddle of the court and dropped it
through ri »S ' n a fashion that
brought the from the house.
Likewise, he was tbe\vl\oje defense in
the last period of\"h*gamt.^-^P ttan' n
Adams was bothered by a sore
and was seriously handicapped in the
latter stages of the game. Richmond
was oft color, too, so the bulk of the
defensive work fell to the "Swede."
Coop was the outstanding star for the
Berkeley aggregation. He was planted
under the basket and was fed con
tinually by his teammates in a fashion
that Powell's men did not stop, and he
made every opportunity count. Coop
scored sixteen of the thirty California
points.
Eggleston played a pretty defensive
game for the Blue and Gold. His work
in this contest stamps him as one of the
best guards in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. He was working on "Swede"
Righter during most of the game, and
despite the fact that the blond forward
is a mighty shifty man and starred on
his own account, the work of Eggleston
was worthy of high praise.
Stanford's defeat at the hands of the
Bruin quintet changes the whole face of
the Conference standing. The two teams
are now tied for first place with a per
centage of .800, each team having won
four games and lost one. The results of
the two scries played in the north by
each team will decide the owner of the
title. California has four fairly easy
games with the tail-enders, while Stan
ford tangles with two of the best teams
ever, and a roar of cheers greeted him |
as he took his place again at center.
No more scores were made this half j
and the period ended 13 to 11 in favor j
of California.
The second half opened with the !
bleachers confident that the babes \
would stage a comeback and run away [ I
from the Bruins. But the Californians j \
had a reserve of speed in store and j I
ran up a ten-point lead in the first j
five minutes before the dazed locals y
got to going. The Californians had |
seen the fault of their foul making I
in the first period and now** took more =
ci're not to make any more, so the f
free shooting in this period was not \
so productive. Granger scored one |
field goal and Mac Hose two in this I
period. Pierce of California went out i
with four personals and Wetzel sub- f
stituted. Shortly after he went in he I
§
was laid out in a scramble over the r
ball. Overexcitement on the part of
some leatherlungs in the bleachers
lead to calls of "stalling," and "take
him out." When they saw he was
really laid cold the shouts changed to
cheers. Carson substituted for Wet
zel.
I
With the half about gone Reeder
substituted for Jansen. The babes
held then for a few minutes but were
unable to keep the Bruin captain,
Talt, from scoring two more field
goals and running the final score up
to 37. The babes got ten points in
this half, bringing their total up to 21.
As for stars in the game, they were
not. Campbell played a spectacular
game at guard but his work was with
out finish and he was called several
times for minor infractions such as
traveling. Jansei\, Mac Hose, Granger
and Smith, played strong games and
each worked well with his team
mates. !
For the Californians, Talt, captain
and forward, was the star of the quin- i
tet. He did all the free shooting, I
completing ten out of eleven tries.
He also scored twelve of the field po- j
ints made by the Blue and Gold or- i
ganization. Kincaid, All-American
guard, did not show up according to
what was expected. Granger held him
down so that he really did not come ;
up at all with the work of the rest of
his team mates. _

centage of .800, each team having won
four games and lost one. The results of
the two scries played in the north by
each team will decide the owner of the
title. California has four fairly easy
games with the tail-enders, while Stan
ford tangles with two of the best teams
ever, and a roar of cheers greeted him |
as he took his place again at center.
No more scores were made this half j
and the period ended 13 to 11 in favor j
of California.
The second half opened with the !
bleachers confident that the babes \
would stage a comeback and run away [ I
from the Bruins. But the Californians j \
had a reserve of speed in store and j I
ran up a ten-point lead in the first j
five minutes before the dazed locals y
got to going. The Californians had |
seen the fault of their foul making I
in the first period and now** took more =
ci're not to make any more, so the f
free shooting in this period was not \
so productive. Granger scored one |
field goal and Mac Hose two in this I
period. Pierce of California went out i
with four personals and Wetzel sub- f
stituted. Shortly after he went in he I
§
was laid out in a scramble over the r
ball. Overexcitement on the part of
some leatherlungs in the bleachers
lead to calls of "stalling," and "take
him out." When they saw he was
really laid cold the shouts changed to
cheers. Carson substituted for Wet
zel.
I
With the half about gone Reeder
substituted for Jansen. The babes
held then for a few minutes but were
unable to keep the Bruin captain,
Talt, from scoring two more field
goals and running the final score up
to 37. The babes got ten points in
this half, bringing their total up to 21.
As for stars in the game, they were
not. Campbell played a spectacular
game at guard but his work was with
out finish and he was called several
times for minor infractions such as
traveling. Jansei\, Mac Hose, Granger
and Smith, played strong games and
each worked well with his team
mates. !
For the Californians, Talt, captain
and forward, was the star of the quin- i
tet. He did all the free shooting, I
completing ten out of eleven tries.
He also scored twelve of the field po- j
ints made by the Blue and Gold or- i
ganization. Kincaid, All-American
guard, did not show up according to
what was expected. Granger held him
down so that he really did not come ;
up at all with the work of the rest of
his team mates. _

Old Joe Slump hit the Stanford Varsity quintet Saturday night and they
lost their first game this season to California. The score was 30 to 24, and the
game was of the gruelling order, crammed full of action from start to finish.
That there was something radically wrong with the Cardinal quintet was appar
ent from the jump. The players lacked the old fire that has characterized their
work in all the preceding games. This was no doubt due to the two hard games
played with Washington the early part of the week.
Stanford took the lead when Mills converted a foul for the first point.
The Bruin Varsity came right back with a field goal and the battle was on.
The teams see-sawed hack and forth throughout the first period, with first one
team leading and then the other. The score at half time was 13 to 12 in favor
of California.

This did not worry any of the Car
dinal rooters, of whom there were over
four hundred in attendance, as Stanford
has always come from behind to win out
in the last half. But they lacked the
necessary stamina to cinch this game
and gradually lost ground in the final
period. The team went to pieces and
seemed to forget the system that they
had perfected. Meanwhile, the Califor
nians were putting forth every effort to
win he game, and they took advantage
of Stanford's lack of ginger to sneak
over the necessary points.
The old dependable "Swede" Righter
played his usual consistent hall and was
by all odds the star of the game. Four
times Righter took the pellet in the
Yhjddle of the court and dropped it
through ri »S ' n a fashion that
brought the from the house.
Likewise, he was tbe\vl\oje defense in
the last period of\"h*gamt.^-^P ttan' n
Adams was bothered by a sore
and was seriously handicapped in the
latter stages of the game. Richmond
was oft color, too, so the bulk of the
defensive work fell to the "Swede."
Coop was the outstanding star for the
Berkeley aggregation. He was planted
under the basket and was fed con
tinually by his teammates in a fashion
that Powell's men did not stop, and he
made every opportunity count. Coop
scored sixteen of the thirty California
points.
Eggleston played a pretty defensive
game for the Blue and Gold. His work
in this contest stamps him as one of the
best guards in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. He was working on "Swede"
Righter during most of the game, and
despite the fact that the blond forward
is a mighty shifty man and starred on
his own account, the work of Eggleston
was worthy of high praise.

Old Joe Slump hit the Stanford Varsity quintet Saturday night and they
lost their first game this season to California. The score was 30 to 24, and the
game was of the gruelling order, crammed full of action from start to finish.
That there was something radically wrong with the Cardinal quintet was appar
ent from the jump. The players lacked the old fire that has characterized their
work in all the preceding games. This was no doubt due to the two hard games
played with Washington the early part of the week.
Stanford took the lead when Mills converted a foul for the first point.
The Bruin Varsity came right back with a field goal and the battle was on.
The teams see-sawed hack and forth throughout the first period, with first one
team leading and then the other. The score at half time was 13 to 12 in favor
of California.

This did not worry any of the Car
dinal rooters, of whom there were over
four hundred in attendance, as Stanford
has always come from behind to win out
in the last half. But they lacked the
necessary stamina to cinch this game
and gradually lost ground in the final
period. The team went to pieces and
seemed to forget the system that they
had perfected. Meanwhile, the Califor
nians were putting forth every effort to
win he game, and they took advantage
of Stanford's lack of ginger to sneak
over the necessary points.
The old dependable "Swede" Righter
played his usual consistent hall and was
by all odds the star of the game. Four
times Righter took the pellet in the
Yhjddle of the court and dropped it
through ri »S ' n a fashion that
brought the from the house.
Likewise, he was tbe\vl\oje defense in
the last period of\"h*gamt.^-^P ttan' n
Adams was bothered by a sore
and was seriously handicapped in the
latter stages of the game. Richmond
was oft color, too, so the bulk of the
defensive work fell to the "Swede."
Coop was the outstanding star for the
Berkeley aggregation. He was planted
under the basket and was fed con
tinually by his teammates in a fashion
that Powell's men did not stop, and he
made every opportunity count. Coop
scored sixteen of the thirty California
points.
Eggleston played a pretty defensive
game for the Blue and Gold. His work
in this contest stamps him as one of the
best guards in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence. He was working on "Swede"
Righter during most of the game, and
despite the fact that the blond forward
is a mighty shifty man and starred on
his own account, the work of Eggleston
was worthy of high praise.
Stanford's defeat at the hands of the
Bruin quintet changes the whole face of
the Conference standing. The two teams
are now tied for first place with a per
centage of .800, each team having won
four games and lost one. The results of
the two scries played in the north by
each team will decide the owner of the
title. California has four fairly easy
games with the tail-enders, while Stan
ford tangles with two of the best teams
ever, and a roar of cheers greeted him |
as he took his place again at center.
No more scores were made this half j
and the period ended 13 to 11 in favor j
of California.
The second half opened with the !
bleachers confident that the babes \
would stage a comeback and run away [ I
from the Bruins. But the Californians j \
had a reserve of speed in store and j I
ran up a ten-point lead in the first j
five minutes before the dazed locals y
got to going. The Californians had |
seen the fault of their foul making I
in the first period and now** took more =
ci're not to make any more, so the f
free shooting in this period was not \
so productive. Granger scored one |
field goal and Mac Hose two in this I
period. Pierce of California went out i
with four personals and Wetzel sub- f
stituted. Shortly after he went in he I
§
was laid out in a scramble over the r
ball. Overexcitement on the part of
some leatherlungs in the bleachers
lead to calls of "stalling," and "take
him out." When they saw he was
really laid cold the shouts changed to
cheers. Carson substituted for Wet
zel.
I
With the half about gone Reeder
substituted for Jansen. The babes
held then for a few minutes but were
unable to keep the Bruin captain,
Talt, from scoring two more field
goals and running the final score up
to 37. The babes got ten points in
this half, bringing their total up to 21.
As for stars in the game, they were
not. Campbell played a spectacular
game at guard but his work was with
out finish and he was called several
times for minor infractions such as
traveling. Jansei\, Mac Hose, Granger
and Smith, played strong games and
each worked well with his team
mates. !
For the Californians, Talt, captain
and forward, was the star of the quin- i
tet. He did all the free shooting, I
completing ten out of eleven tries.
He also scored twelve of the field po- j
ints made by the Blue and Gold or- i
ganization. Kincaid, All-American
guard, did not show up according to
what was expected. Granger held him
down so that he really did not come ;
up at all with the work of the rest of
his team mates. _
