freshmen quintetN went down to a
crushing defeat in th£'?„ econ d P ei 'iod
before California, Saturday The
score was 37 to 21. The babes* , fev l0W "
ed a better brand of ball than th"6*
have in any of their past performances
and during the entire first period
kept the Blue and Gold Cubs on the
run. The second half proved the un
doing of the freshmen and the su
perior weight of the Californians be
gan to tell at the opening of the
period when they ran up a ten-point
lead in the first five minutes of the
second session.
The two teams lined up with about
fifteen pounds weight advantage to
the Bruins. California came first on
the court and warmed up, with every
appearance of confidence in their
ability to make short work of the
Cardinal youngsters. Then when the
local freshmen made their entrance
they plainly showed to be lighter, but
seemed better on the basket ringing
than the opposition.
The game started by the California
team scoring twice in the first couple
of minutes before the locals got going.
Then a foul on California resulted in a
complete basket on a free throw by
Mac Hose and soon after he shot one
from the field, bringing the score up
to the Californians. Then Pierce, the
California forward, made a couple of
neat throws from the field and pushed
the California side of the score up to
eight. Fouls were many in this half
due to the close calling of referee
Glenn. The Bruin babes evinced a
tendency to make penalties by hold
ing and the accurate free shooting of
Mac Hose helped materially in evening
the score of the half. He com
pleted seven out of ten tries in the
first period.
With about three minutes to go in
the first half Captain Jansen collided
with Wright, the California center,
and went out for the count. Conster
nation reigned among the bleacherites
for "Bob" had been playing a whale
of a game. Ministrations of "Doc"
Pillsbury brought him around, how
in the league. However, there is no
cause for worry, now that the Cardinal
players have shaken the one had game.
It was natural to expect that there
would be a breaker to the long string of
victories, and while it came at a crucial
time it will have a beneficial effect on
the northern games because of the added
irityortance of them.

With about three minutes to go in

with Wright, the California center,
and went out for the count. Conster
nation reigned among the bleacherites

of a game. Ministrations of "Doc"
Pillsbury brought him around, how
in the league. However, there is no
cause for worry, now that the Cardinal
players have shaken the one had game.
It was natural to expect that there
would be a breaker to the long string of

time it will have a beneficial effect on
the northern games because of the added

gan to tell at the opening of the
period when they ran up a ten-point
lead in the first five minutes of the
second session.
The two teams lined up with about
fifteen pounds weight advantage to
the Bruins. California came first on
the court and warmed up, with every
appearance of confidence in their
ability to make short work of the
Cardinal youngsters. Then when the
local freshmen made their entrance
they plainly showed to be lighter, but
seemed better on the basket ringing
than the opposition.
The game started by the California
team scoring twice in the first couple
of minutes before the locals got going.
Then a foul on California resulted in a
complete basket on a free throw by
Mac Hose and soon after he shot one
from the field, bringing the score up
to the Californians. Then Pierce, the
California forward, made a couple of
neat throws from the field and pushed
the California side of the score up to
eight. Fouls were many in this half
due to the close calling of referee
Glenn. The Bruin babes evinced a
tendency to make penalties by hold
ing and the accurate free shooting of
Mac Hose helped materially in evening
the score of the half. He com
pleted seven out of ten tries in the
