# PURPOSE AND POLICY
## 
### 
Volume 59 of the Daily Palo Alto will be published with one aim
in view: to serve as best it may the interests of the student body in whose
behalf it is printed.
How this end may best be accomplished is the continual problem of
the Daily. It purposes first to print all the news, unbiased and uncolored
as possible, and in this the co-operation of the university community is
solicited. Editorially the Daily will attempt to take an all-university
attitude, to look to the best of its ability to the university as a whole.
Direct criticism is invited* The columns of the Daily will always
be open to signed opinions of reasonable length, and Ix>th sides of all
controversies will be cheerfully printed". Faculty opinion is earnestly
requested.
In attempting- to maintain a creditable newspaper the Daily is con
fronted at present with the handicap of limited finances. Important
general changes have been made to reduce costs, and in the day-to-day
make-up small features that would add materially to the tone and char
acter of the paper, must be put aside for the same reason.
However, the situation is slowly improving, and it is hoped that
the end of the spring quarter will see the debt wiped out and the Daily,
financially sound, in a position more effectively to continue with the
policy on which it is founded.
