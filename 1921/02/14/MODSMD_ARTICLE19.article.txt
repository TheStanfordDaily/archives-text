# CONFERENCE LEADERSHIP
## 
### 
The Stanford Varsity left the basketball floor Friday night de
feated the first time this season. The men fought desperately at Berke
ley, but together in the system they know and consequently
exhibit the type of game the Cardinal followers are accustomed
to see. It was the first off-game <?f the year, and Coach Powell un
doubtedly saw and will be able to correct the mistakes of the quintet.
There was among the Stanford stands at California a certain dis
gust at the showing of the team. Its supporters should remember that
the most expert athlete cannot make a record in every race, and occa
sionally a 9% second man is beaten in 10 flat. The Cardinal five had
been running in stellar form for nearly a dozen games.
The Varsity has four hard contests in the North, while the Blue
and Gold compete there with the Conference cellar teams. But the
five is now in the position where Stanford teams always show best, at a
disadvantage, and barring injuries should yet land the Conference
leadership.

SEVERAL HUNDRED Stanford students journeyed to California
Friday prepared to out-root a few thousand Berkeleyites. It seems that
at least one Cardinal yell leader should have been prepared to handle
the crowd.

REGARDING ADMINISTRATION of the staff, promotions and
demotions will be made on three considerations: capability, seniority,
and ability to work effectively with the thirty or more other persons
who make up the organization responsible for the publication of the
Daily Palo Alto.
