# PROFESSORS JONES AND WILDMAN ARE QUOTED IN NATION-WIDE POLL
## 
### 
Professor Murray S. Wildman and
Professor Eliot Jones, of the Economics
Department, are quoted in the last issue
of the "Literary Digest" in a "nation
wide poll on the return of prosperity."
Professor Wildman said: "In this
Santa Clara Valley packing houses are
full of unsold fruit; unemployment, al
ways serious at this season, is accen
tuated by influx of idle men from colder
localities. Retail sales are small, as
farmers are slow to buy. No improve
ment yet; all would seem to depend on
fruit sales. Prosperity here rests on just
two things: the fruit harvest —largely a
question of weather—and price of fruit.
Personally I look for two or three years
of relatively dull times, some liquida
tor of land prices, and some in
solvency."
Professor Jones said that present
acivity was poor and continued. "Con
ditions will be worse, undoubtedly. Ex
pect business recovery not before spring,
ind probably not then."
l Professors of economics all over the
country believe that conditions will be
worse before they are better, and are
inclined to emphasize the importance of
illowing months, perhaps years, for
readjustment processes in this country
; '.nd the whole after-war world.
