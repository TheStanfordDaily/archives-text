The Blue and Gold rooters sang,
"California, we're strong for you," at
the game Friday night. Hats off to
the guy who remarked that they were
too darned strong.
* * *
Limousine Lew says it's coats off
for that bird.
* * *
We noticed, as we strolled clown the
Row the other night, at least six of
those seven-to-eight-o'cloek choose
your-own-snake affairs. Academic
activities are certainly taking up a
lot of valuable time.

There once was a jolly young Mormon
Who got him a job as a foreman,
His htarem of nine
Played a tune on his spine
And now he's an awfully soremon.

Look before you leap. Two men
were run over by street cars in San
Francisco last week. Leap and then
look.
* * *
First Poker-hound—l. gotta paira
bullets... Whatta you got?
Second P. H.—Automobiles.
First ditto—Whazzat?

I'm fiifteen cents light. Changa
Berry, Ed.
* * *
Rougher—l gotta room mate who's
so lazy he won't get up for his eight
o'clocks.
Slicker —'Snothing, I got one who is
so lazy he won't keep his eyes open
on the Engineering Corner.

Sing a song of six bits, pocketful o'
rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds, baked
into a pie,
When the pie was opened the birds
began to sing,
Must have had Tagawa acookin* for
the king.
* * *
"Yes," says one of our contempo
raries, i"The early worm gets 'the
Cabbage," Whassat, a bookworm?

We are glad to learn that it "ap
pears that the paper will be able to
survive the spring" under our new
editor.
