# TUITION RAISES ALL OVER UNITED STATES ABOUT FITY PER CENT
## 
### 
That Stanford is by no means the
only university that has increased the
tuition greatly is shown by the pub
lication of a list of the various tui
tion raises of the Eastern institutions
in the annual report of President A. L.
Lowell, of Harvard. President Lowell
in his report declares that, owing; to
the increased expense, and despite the
fact that some $12,000,000 was raised
by a drive last year, Harvard faces
the necessity of a higher tuition fee.
The present charge is about $200 a
year, and the proposed increase is 50
per cent, which will thus bring the
sum to $300.
Three hundred dollars is now the
average tuition fee for almost all of
the leading universities, the state in
stitutions, of course, being excepted.
The following figures were cited, giv
ing past and present charges made:
Columbia—ln 1919, $192; now $256.
Dartmouth —In 1920, $200; raised
next year to $250.
Yale—ln 1918, $200; now $300.
Princeton —In 1920, $250; next year
$300.
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy— for all students entering
on or after September, 1920*.
Bryn Mawr, Vassar, and Wellesley—
In 1920, $150 to $200; next year, $300.
