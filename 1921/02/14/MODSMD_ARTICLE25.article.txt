# Major Collins Speaks Before Fremont Post
## 
### 
At the regular meeting of Fremont
Post last tweek. Major Collins gave an
interesting talk in which he covered
the general history of college military
unit, throughout the United States.
He gave a thorough history of the
unit at Stanford up to the present
time and what it expects to accomplish
in the future. One point of interest
which he touched on was the unfor
tunate effect which the S. A. T. C.
had on the R. O. T. C., causing a com
plete disorganization of the R. O. T.
C. and a prejudice against it.
Comrade "Fighting Bob" Robinson
explained the several bonus bills
which are now up before the state
legislature.
