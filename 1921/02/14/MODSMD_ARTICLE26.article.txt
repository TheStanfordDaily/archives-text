# FRESHMAN SOCCER TEAM TIES WITH SAN MATEO HIGH
## 
### 
Sacramento may be the goal of
Stanford's championship eleven
if plans now maturing work out as
expected. Plans are under way for an
invasion of northern California to see
what Stanford can show them there
in the way of soccer.
Coach Maloney has written to the
Sacramento officials to set a suitable
date, probably February 22, and make
the necessary arrangements. If they
decide to put up a team against the
Cardinal, it will be in the nature of an
all-star team chosen from the Sacra
mento Soccer League organizations,
and will without doubt be able to give
Stanford a hard battle. Nothing de
finite can be stated about the pro
posed trip as yet until the Sacramento
officials have been heard from.
The only soccer game played here
over the week-end was the freshman-
San Mateo high schrimmage, which
ended in a 1 to 1 score. The '24 team
showed up very well, and put up a
good fight against rathej; unfavor
able odds. All during the game there
were only ten men on the field for the
freshmen, and with this incomplete
team they held the San Mateo boys
to a tie. San, Mateo showed improve
ment, but Captain Todd and his men
are also steadily showing up better
as the quarter goes on. No more
games have been arranged at pres
ent.
The American Legion was to have
played California Saturday, but at the
last moment word came from Berkeley
that they could not come down.
