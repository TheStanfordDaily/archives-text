# SECOND AND THIRD PLACE MEN NEEDED FOR TRACK WORK
## 
### 
the track squad was issued today by Dr.
A. D. Browne, head of the Physical
Training Department He declared that
while the team has a number of good
place men, the squad needs men
who can take second and third place.
These are essential to win the meet with
California, he added. Dr. Browne's
statement follows:
"Last spring the California track
team won from Stanford by a slight
margin. The relay was the deciding
event, but Stanford was weak in the 440
and the meet went to California. Stan
ford should not have allowed the meet
to hang on the relay event, as the 440
was the weakest event. A margin of
points in favor of Stanford should have
been secured before the relay took place,
but she failed in this by having too few
second and third place men.
"Stanford had a few stars of unusual
ability, but woefully weak in men of
mediocre ability. The student body
itself showed a marked indifference to
the lack of men who might have, by
continuous training and aggressive ef
fort, contributed second and third place
points to the final score. Our' team last
spring was not well balanced. It is true
we had stars, but a star wins only five
points in an event while the other, places
count for four points, and the oppo
nents usually have a few stars, too.
"We are approaching the 1921 track
season and now is the time to make
place for a sucessful team. Coach 1 em
pleton reports 260 men on his squad,
which is reported to be the largest squad
in the history of track at Stanford.
"The squad may be the largest, but it
certainly is not the best, but with a few
good men for a nucleus 1 believe "Dink'
Templeton can build up a well-balanced
team if the students give him support
not side-line support, but the kind that
will put five hundred men on the track
squed.
"We have some experienced men on
the campus who will be glad to assist
Templeton in handling this number of
candidates. We have ' Dad Moulton,
C. S. Botsford, Harry Maloney, Dean
Culver, Alva Richards, of Cornell, and
Professor Everett W. Smith. All of
these men have had coaching experience
and are specialists in certain events. 1 he
coaches' plan calls for many preliminary
contests in the form of \intramural
meets."
