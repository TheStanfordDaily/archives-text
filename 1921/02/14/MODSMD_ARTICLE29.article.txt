# BISHOP DECLARES JAZZ NOT IMMORAL
## 
### 
Jazz is not immoral if it is properly
danced. This is the edict of Bishop
! Chapon of Nice, which is probably the
! jazziest city on earth at the present
moment, for all the world and his wife
have invaded the French riviera this
year.
Speaking of the decolette dress, the
bishop said:
"Indecency is not a matter of inches,
by manner. Victorian fashions which
in those days were almost prduisli,
would be indecent if worn today by
some modern women."
