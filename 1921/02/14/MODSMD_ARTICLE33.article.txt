OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, Corvallis, February 14. â€”The
magnitude of the Oregon Agricultural
College in its many branches of work
astonished members of the Legislature
who were guests of the institution. In
a two-hour trip around the buildings
they were able to see only a small part
of the work actually done.
"The Oregon Agricultural College,"
explained President W. J. Kerr, "has an
enrollment of 3,520 regular long-course
resident students, an increase of 125 per
cent during the last three years. When*
a college exceeds the 3,500 mark, it is
no longer a small institution. There are
2,468 men and 1,052 women in the col
lege, and of these 3.138 arc high-school
graduates, the remainder being mostly
mature students who are taking special
vocational work."
One hundred and fifty-one students
came here this year from other colleges
and universities. President Kerr ex
plained the financing of the
bringing out the fact that the resident
of regular college work, the extension
work and the experiment station are all
under separate provision, and that funds
for one cannot be used for the others.
