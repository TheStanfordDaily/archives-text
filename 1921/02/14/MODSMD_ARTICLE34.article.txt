# HONOR SYSTEM IS SUCCESSFUL IN LAW SCHOOL
## Dean C. A. Huston In Letter to President Wilbur Tells Legal Department's System 
### 
1 hat the honor system is working
successfully in the Stanford Law School
is the belief of Dean Charles A. Huston,
as expressed in a recent letter by him to
President Wilbur. "In the history of
the Law School during my fifteen years'
acquaintance with it," he declared, "I
have known of only one case'of cheat
ing in a lew examination. I have had,
during that time, the testimony of a
large number of men in whose veracity
I have the utmost confidence that the
plan worked successfully."
The statement of Dean Huston con
tains additional evidence of the practi
cability of installing an honor system
at Stanford. The letter follows declara
tions from the Departments of Mining
and Metallurgy, Geology, and Philos
ophy, that the system in those depart
ments lias by experience proven satis
factory.
"The Law School has used the system
| in conducting its examinations for the
last sixteen years," continued the dean.
"There . are no rules and regulations
covering the system. The instructor re
ports any evidence of dishonesty,
| whether the evidence consists in infor
mation arising out of the papers them
selves or from information given him
by members of the cjass, together with
a statement supplementing the evidence
itself."
Various factors contribute to make
the system a success in the opinion of
the head of the Law Department. A
very strong esprit de corps among the
students aids in the observance of the
regulations. "In one case I am told that
the students themselves invited a man
who cheated to withdraw, and he did so
without anything being said by the
faculty. At a meeting of the members
of the Law School early in the first

quarter of the college year an informal
speech is made by some alumnus of the
Law School in which he tells of his own
acquaintance with the honor system
during his membership in the Law-
School, and urges upon the students that
they respect it as one of the best tradi
tions of the Law School."
I think I should say in fairness." adds
j Dean Huston," that the conditions un
der which the honor system was inaug
urated in the Law School and the char
acter of law examinations both tend to
make the observance of the honor sys
tem relatively easy. Law examinations
consist of hypothetical cases. It is not
possible by reading parts of another
man s paper, or even consulting a text
book, to make reasonably sure that the
copier can successfully answer the ques
tion. Further, in the conducting of
examinations the students are seated at
alternate desks, so that any temptation
to copy is reduced to a minimum."

speech is made by some alumnus of the
Law School in which he tells of his own
acquaintance with the honor system
during his membership in the Law-
School, and urges upon the students that
they respect it as one of the best tradi
tions of the Law School."
I think I should say in fairness." adds
j Dean Huston," that the conditions un
der which the honor system was inaug
urated in the Law School and the char
acter of law examinations both tend to
make the observance of the honor sys
tem relatively easy. Law examinations
consist of hypothetical cases. It is not
possible by reading parts of another
man s paper, or even consulting a text
book, to make reasonably sure that the
copier can successfully answer the ques
tion. Further, in the conducting of
examinations the students are seated at
alternate desks, so that any temptation
to copy is reduced to a minimum."
