be moved into the corporation yards
and will be used as an office for the
toreman of the grounds. The blocks
are under it, the rollers ready, and if
the weather clears tomorrow the Uni
versity house-moving truck will pull it
;o what may be the final resting place.
Delyon is moving today into the Men's
Union Building, and will occupy the
basement room where the barber shop
was.
Ten years ago the little old building
and Delyon started their career on the
campus together. At that time the build
ing sat just back of the Union. Tn a
few years it was moved to the curve
by the post-office, and Delyon stoutly as
serts that he repaired shoes the whole
day that it was moved. Then it was
moved to its present place on Lagunita
Drive, where it has stood among its
wooden fellows and remained to be the
last one to give way to the new era of
progress.
