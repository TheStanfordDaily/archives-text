# ENGLISH CLUB PLAY TO BEGIN DAILY PRACTICES
## Production Was Handicapped by Other Plays; Drama to be new Slant on Dramatics 
### 
Rehearsals for the Chinese conven
tional play "The Yellow Jacket," to
be produced by the English Club on
March 8, will be started intensively
this week, according to Coach Gordon
Davis. Since the announcement of
the cast only part time practices
could be heul on account of the Ram's
head rehearsals and regular weekly
musicals.
"We are going to give the campus
something which will be enttirely dif
ferent," says Davis. "Never before
has a play which depicts the workings
of Chinese dramatics been produced
here. Although "The Yellow Jacket"
may have pathos and seriousness for
the Celestial, it will be a play of
humor and laughter for the campus
audience."
The production was written by
English playwrights who studied the
Chinese ways. They saw their op
portunity to write an extremely amus
ing drama. Although its first appear
ance in New York did not draw the
entire appreciation of the audience,
the most renowned critics of the
country predicted a great success. It
has become known the world over and
is as the Boston Transcript termed
it, "A- rare and marvelous enter
tainment."
"The Yellow Jacket" has been pre
sented in every capital and metropolis
throughout the civilized world. New
York, London, Berlin, Munich, Vienna,
Budapest, Petrograd and Moscow in
turn have set upon it, the seal of their
artistic and popular approval. "In
literal truth, 'The Yellow Jacket' may
be called 'The play that has charmed
the wo.'d'," says a leader in world
dramatics^
