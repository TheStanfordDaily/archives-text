# H. R .FAIRCLOUGH WILL LECTURE UPON SLAVIC CONDITIONS
## 
### 
"Montenegro and the Dalmatian
I Coast" will be the subject of the illus
trated lecture which Professor Fair
clough will give in the Little Theater
tomorrow evening at 7:30 o'clock. This
subject is one which will probably be of
interest, due to the great prominence
given this part of the country during the
great war and the recent Fiume episode.
Professor Fairclough is eminenth
suited to discuss this subject, since he
has spent nearly two years in Monte
negro and Jugo-Slavia. During the war
he had the rank of lieutenant-colonel in
the American Red Cross forces em
ployed in the southern field, and his
activity there has woon for him recogni
tion by these governments.
Although not one of the original in
structors at Stanford, Professor Fair
clough came here in 1894, and has been
a member of the faculty ever since. He
is now head of the Latin Department.
The lecture tomorrow will cover gen
eral conditions in Jugo-Slavia, especially
in Montenegro and on the Dalmatian
coast. Professor Fairclough will touch
upon the differences existing between
Jugo-Slavia and Italy, which were sup
posedly settled in the recent treaty of
Rapallo, under the terms of which
D'Annunzio had to evacuate Fiume. The
political situation and the general geo
graphical and historic background will
also be discussed. A large number of
slides will be shown of the interior and
of the coastal region.
