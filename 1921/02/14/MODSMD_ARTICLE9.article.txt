# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB SKIT THIS EVENING
## 
### 
The Cosmopolitan Club will give
their most unique entertainment of
the year this evening, when sixteen
nationalities will be represented in
"Cosmopolitan Night." Committees
from each nationality in the club were
appointed at the last meeting, and
each is responsible for a five-minute
"stunt" typical of the nation it rep
resents. Several varieties of native
music, songs, and dances, have been
planned, and the American students
have arranged for a four-piece fresh
man orchestra. Novel refreshments
will be served.
The club will meet promptly at 7:30
in the reception room of the Women's
Club House.
