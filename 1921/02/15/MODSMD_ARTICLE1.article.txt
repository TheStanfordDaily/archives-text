# MURPHY ARRANGES FAST BOUTS FUR MING TOURNEY
## Phil Noonan, Billy Leonard, Olympic Club Officials, to Referee Boxing Contests 
### 
Phil Noonan or Billy Leonard, both
of the Olympic Club, will officiate at
the boxing tournament to be held on
Thursday evening, February 17, in
Encina Gymnasium.

The dope comes straight from Coach
Murphy that three of the bouts hid
fair to he the best ever presented at
Stanford. When Johnny Lane and
Bill Burkhart, two welterweights,
walk out fiom their corners the local

fans can expect to see more out and
out class than is usually delivered
in amateur matches. Lane has boxed
three seasons and worked against
U. S. C. last year. Burkhart is als©
a three-season man and this quarter
has shown more class in the ring
than any man around the Gymnasium.

Another welterweight match whJ'dh
•will present real talent is the one be
tween Phil Neer and Walter Bills.
Neer is a veteran at the game and
started in ring work with the Mulno
mah Club of Portland. In 1917 he was
runner-up for the amateur national
championship in the featherweight
class. He wields as good a right cross
as he does a tennis racke't. Bills was
a close contender for the welterweight
honors of the University last season.
He has the speed and grit to umke
him a dangerous man to meet.

The "bont between Jimmy Ross and
Gay Hen sold would "be a feature 'ibotit
in any ordinary array, Tbut in this case
they are all features for their res
pective weights. ltoBs makrs his
first appeujrance :as a lightweight this
year. Last season he *won the feather
weight coast championship in his
first bouts. He fights low and has a
play of foot work which makes him
hard to (faandle. HeKsold is nne of
the best lightweight boxers in the
ITniversitj and when the final gong
sounds for these two mitt-artists the
fans will have seen a real match,
featuring all the fine points of the
game.
After tl*s settlement of this bout
and another in the lightweight class
between Howell Smith and Bob Spiers
there will be a feature bout, or a de
cision on general work, to pitik the
man to met;t California.
For the first time in the? histery of
Stanford boxing, two full-flfedged
heavyweights will be seen in action.
Harley Cartel*, gridiron man, and Jim
Arthur are file men and When ithey
swing into the ropes there will be
some straining of hemp and creaking
•of framework.
