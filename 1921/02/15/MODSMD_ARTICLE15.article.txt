# STANFORD PLAYS W. S. C. FIVE ON PULLMAN COURT
## Cardinal Quintet Opens Two Game Series With Cougars in Northern City, Tonight 
### 
Tonight, in Pullman, Washington,
Coach Powell's court team will play the
Cougars of Washington State in the
first of a two-game series. The Stan
ford quintet arrived in Pullman yester
day, and after resting today they will*he
in fine fettle for the opening game of
their northern tour. Hut little is known
of the Washington State team, except
that they are in third place in the Con
ference and that they defeated the Uni
versity of Washington in one game.

The dope favors Stanford to win on
the strength of pre-season records, al
though playing on a strange court after
a hard journey may affect the team's
playing to some extent. In order to
retain a chance for the Pacific Coast
championship the Cardinal five will have
to win three out of the four scheduled
games in the north and will then have
to win two games from the Bruin aggre
gation on their return home to cinch
the title.

"Swede" Righter, Jimmy Davies, and
"Lefty" Rogers will do the goal shooting
against the Washington Staters. These
men have all been playing consistent
hall and can be counted upon to corac
through tonight. Bert Mills has a
charley-horse that affected his playing
in Berkeley last Friday night, but the
four days of rest have no doubt fixed
him up. Dick Richmond and Captain
Adams will do the defensive work.
Adams, also, has been suffering from a
sore wrist and a strained thumb, but
his .injuries are on the mend and he will
be prepared to play his usual hard
game.
