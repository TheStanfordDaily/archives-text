# FRESHMAN QUINTET PRACTICES HARD TO WIN SECOND CONTEST
## 
### 
The second game of the Stanford-
California freshman basketball series
comes tomorrow night at the University
of California. The Babes met a crush
ing defeat in the last game, when the
Bruin Cubs handed them the knockout
in the second period of play. Monday
night and last night they practiced hard!,
working against the play form that the
Califomians used here in the last game,
and should put up a better competition
when they meet tomorrow night.

Jansen is going again in good shape
after the wallop in the mouth that he
received in the last contest, and has no
ill effects from the slammed mouth.
When he slowed up in the last game
was when the northerners started their
rush that carried them so far ahead of
the worn-out local freshmen.
The same lineup worked in the prac
tice last night that started the first game
and will probably start the game tomor
row night at Harmon Gymnasium.

"Scotchy" Campbell continues to play
his strong game at guard and will un
doubtedly be a starter in the game. Cap
tain Jansen, McHose, Granger Camp
bell. and Smith have their numerals
cinched now, and Jess Reeder .has one
leg captured on his number. Several
other men will possibly get a chance to
show thdir work in the contest if things
go according to the dope that is present
now.
