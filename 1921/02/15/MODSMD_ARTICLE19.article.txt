# HONOR AT STANFORD
## 
### 
Stanford men and women have always favored the honor principle
in examinations, but heretofore no practical measures have been taken
to effect its general adoption. A majority of the students have for
many years envied'those of the few departments where the honor sys
tem has been applied without reservation, in a way that is in part indi
cated by the following statement from the Daily Palo Alto of February
16, 1914, by a student in economics.
"What added advantage has the Law department? Do we
need policemen where they do not? I as an American citizen
object to being imprisoned and spied upon for one hour while
taking an examination. True, this is the statement of ati ideal
ist, but I believe greater honesty could be secured as it has been
secured by the Law department. Under the present system of
spies and guards I would not think of feporting my neighbor
who was employing unfair means, for he would be successfully
meeting the challenge. But under the honor system I would
not hesitate an instant to warn one who would be so base, so
disloyal to democracy as to cheat.
"Are the lawyers more honest—in college—than the rest
of us ... ?"
Certainly the lawyers claim nothing over members of other depart
ments, except that they actually apply the honor system while many
others do not.
A student committee under Marion Kyle, '18, is now laying the
possibilities of the honor plan before the various departments, and one
by one they are declaring in favor of a definite trial.
Student members of departments which have not yet acted on the
honor proposal, who believe in its principle, may do well to make known
their belief to their respectitve major professors, for undoubtedly men
who conduct examinations are no more pleased with the duty of watch
f'rrg for cheaters, than are the students who are being watched; and the
time will never be better than now to make Stanford entirely an "honor
university."
