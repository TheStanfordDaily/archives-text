### Pacific Intercollegiate News Service 
The University of Oregon student
body will produce "Arizona," Augustus
Thomas' four-act comedy-drama, on
March 5. Rehearsals will begin shortly,
the cast having been chosen. Star Nor
ton will take the lead as Bonita Canby,
while Lieutenant Denton will be played
by Lyle' Bartholomew. As this is the
students' play, it is planned to have the
prices as moderate as possible. An effort
is being made to secure the U. of O.
orchestra to provide the musical accom
paniment.
