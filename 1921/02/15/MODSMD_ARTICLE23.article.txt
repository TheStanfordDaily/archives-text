# ERNST BRANDSTEN HAS CHARGE OF ACQUATICS
## 
### 
Ernest Brandsten, director of swim-1
ming at Stanford, member of the Na
tional Swimming Rules Committee, and
holder of several world's titles in div- ]
ing, is the man to whom is due the]
credit for the enviable position the Car
dinal holds in the aquatic world. Di
rector Brandsten came to Stanford with
a remarkable record as a swimmer, a
coach, and chiefly a developer of talent
in the swimming field.
Graduating from the School of Swim
ming. Stockholm, Sweden, in 1902.
Brandsten became instructor at the
Municipal Baths of Stockholm, where
he established a most enviable record.
As a result of his work there he was
selected to pilot the Neptune Swimming
Club of Sweden in 1906. Here Brand
sten had an opportunity to perfect hi
own form in aiding others and became
more proficient in swimming and div
ing. Some of the best swimmers in
the country were developed under his
instruction at this time. %
In the world's championships, held in
1912, Coach Brandsten qualified in the
finals in three diving events,»and in the
following year won the national cham
pionship of Sweden in higlr, springboard,
and plane board diving. In addition to
this record, he has successfully com
peted against the world's best aquatic
artists. He first earned fame on the
coast as a diver when he dove over
ninety feet in an exhibition high diving 1
contest staged in S;yi Francisco Bay.
This feat has never since been equaled
and was considered a very daring ven
ture, though executed in perfect form.
The University of California obtained
his Services as swimming coach in 1911,
which position he held until 1915. While
a coach at the transbay institution some
of the best swimmers in the history of
the Berkeley school were developed,
among whom were Ludy Langer, one of
the best known all-around swimmers.
As a result of his careful instruction
at Stanford, Brandsten succeeded m de- I
/is A I

veloping Norman Ross and Clarence
Pinkstftn, two of the most famous fig
ures in the * present-day swimming
world. Ross came Stanford knowing
j little about form and psychology of
racing, but liis hidden ability was no
ticed by Coach Brandsten, and as a re
sult the greatest swimmer the world has
produced started his. career in-the Car
dinal pool. Brandsten has a knack of
handling men and getting the best there
is in them. Through patience and earn
est labor he has built the Stanford swim
ming team to rank among the first on
the coast and also to score an over
whelming defeat over the varsity and
freshman teams of California.
Coach Brandsten is also a master of
Swedish gymnastics and tumbling,
which lias proven of great assistance in
teaching the various difficult dives. His
system is to first instruct his protege
to dive and turn the various flips from a
belt contraption, giving the person per
fect confidence and ability to execute
the dive when entering the water. With
this belt and springboard device the
most difficult dives can be mastered in a
short time and the development of a
number of very promising divers is
immninent. Under the leadership of
Coach Brandsten swimming Iras become
one of the most popular sports at Stan
ford, and not a day passes hut what the
tank is filled to capacity. There is now
no for any man in Stanford not
knowing how to swim and dive, with as
competent an instructor as Brandsten
and all of the necessary facilities at
hand. If the turnouts continue as prom
ising as in the last few years, there can
be nothing to hinder Stanford from
keeping its place as one of the most
prominent institutions fostering swim
ming in the country.
Mr. Brandsten is one of the best
known authorities on swimming in the
country, is a leader in the Red
life-saving movement, and a keen fol-
I lower of all branches of sports.

As a result of his work there he was
selected to pilot the Neptune Swimming
Club of Sweden in 1906. Here Brand
sten had an opportunity to perfect hi
own form in aiding others and became
more proficient in swimming and div
ing. Some of the best swimmers in
the country were developed under his
instruction at this time. %
In the world's championships, held in
1912, Coach Brandsten qualified in the
finals in three diving events,»and in the
following year won the national cham
pionship of Sweden in higlr, springboard,
and plane board diving. In addition to
this record, he has successfully com
peted against the world's best aquatic
artists. He first earned fame on the
coast as a diver when he dove over
ninety feet in an exhibition high diving 1
contest staged in S;yi Francisco Bay.
This feat has never since been equaled
and was considered a very daring ven
ture, though executed in perfect form.
The University of California obtained
his Services as swimming coach in 1911,
which position he held until 1915. While
a coach at the transbay institution some
of the best swimmers in the history of
the Berkeley school were developed,
among whom were Ludy Langer, one of
the best known all-around swimmers.
As a result of his careful instruction
at Stanford, Brandsten succeeded m de- I

veloping Norman Ross and Clarence
Pinkstftn, two of the most famous fig
ures in the * present-day swimming
world. Ross came Stanford knowing
j little about form and psychology of
racing, but liis hidden ability was no
ticed by Coach Brandsten, and as a re
sult the greatest swimmer the world has
produced started his. career in-the Car
dinal pool. Brandsten has a knack of
handling men and getting the best there
is in them. Through patience and earn
est labor he has built the Stanford swim
ming team to rank among the first on
the coast and also to score an over
whelming defeat over the varsity and
freshman teams of California.
Coach Brandsten is also a master of
Swedish gymnastics and tumbling,
which lias proven of great assistance in
teaching the various difficult dives. His
system is to first instruct his protege
to dive and turn the various flips from a
belt contraption, giving the person per
fect confidence and ability to execute
the dive when entering the water. With
this belt and springboard device the
most difficult dives can be mastered in a
short time and the development of a
number of very promising divers is
immninent. Under the leadership of
Coach Brandsten swimming Iras become
one of the most popular sports at Stan
ford, and not a day passes hut what the
tank is filled to capacity. There is now
no for any man in Stanford not
knowing how to swim and dive, with as
competent an instructor as Brandsten
and all of the necessary facilities at
hand. If the turnouts continue as prom
ising as in the last few years, there can
be nothing to hinder Stanford from
keeping its place as one of the most
prominent institutions fostering swim
