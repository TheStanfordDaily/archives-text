Mrs. Asquith's autobiography is de-1
I servedly one of the marked books of;
recent months. That the author is
the wife of a great British Prime Min
ister, of course, attracts attention to
the book, but the charm of her story
lies in its presentation of the person
alities of the author herself and of
her friends. In her friends Mrs.
Asquith has been unusually fortunate.
Even in the eighties, as Margot Ten-1
I nant, she counted among her intim- j
i ates such young men, since risen to!
; places of high trust, as Arthur James I
1 Balfour, George Curzon, and John |
i MorLey. Among her wjarm friends 1
i were also leading men much older!
i than herself and she has known a:
• I
: round half dozen of Prime Ministers.
Her vivid studies of prominent fig- j
j ures will make her work last as a
valuable contribution to the literature
{ descriptive of the past and passing:
generation.
But the central character of the book
is the author herself. Her childhood
squabbles and escapades, her long and
ardent devotion to riding and danc-1
ing, her interests in books, her friend
ships aud her love affairs, are all
presented in considerable detail, and
with an impartiality that sees defects 1
jas clearly as virtues. The author is [
j conscious that she is studying an un-1
usual and remarkably yinteresting
woman, but how can she well think
otherwise when men like John Ad-j
dington Symonds and John Morley
adn Jowett of Balliol have told her so?
Margot Asquith evidently agrees
with Sir Wilfred Grenfell in holding
that an autobiography must be a free
and full confession or yield to the
charge of insincerity. She pictures
herself as a vital, independent sort of
porson. instictively something of a
sensationalist, and therefore she is
only in character when her story
shocks the staidly conventional by
her frank presentation of some of the
intimacies of life and by her candid
self-appreciation. One rtiight be tempt
ed to find fault with the latter, though
it is quite a different thing from vani
ty, where the book dull or fumbling.
But the workmanship of the tale bears '
out the author's estimate of herself. |
As to reticences, the carping critic
may be reminded that Margot still
preserves a good many, a praiseworthy
accomplishment in these days. And
she dedicates the work to her hus
band with a quotation from Epictetus.

But the central character of the book
is the author herself. Her childhood
squabbles and escapades, her long and
ardent devotion to riding and danc-1
ing, her interests in books, her friend
ships aud her love affairs, are all
presented in considerable detail, and
with an impartiality that sees defects 1
jas clearly as virtues. The author is [
j conscious that she is studying an un-1
usual and remarkably yinteresting
woman, but how can she well think
otherwise when men like John Ad-j
dington Symonds and John Morley
adn Jowett of Balliol have told her so?
Margot Asquith evidently agrees
with Sir Wilfred Grenfell in holding
that an autobiography must be a free
and full confession or yield to the
charge of insincerity. She pictures
herself as a vital, independent sort of
porson. instictively something of a
sensationalist, and therefore she is
only in character when her story
shocks the staidly conventional by
her frank presentation of some of the
intimacies of life and by her candid
self-appreciation. One rtiight be tempt
ed to find fault with the latter, though
it is quite a different thing from vani
ty, where the book dull or fumbling.
But the workmanship of the tale bears '
out the author's estimate of herself. |
As to reticences, the carping critic
may be reminded that Margot still
preserves a good many, a praiseworthy
accomplishment in these days. And
she dedicates the work to her hus
band with a quotation from Epictetus.
