In order that the student body may
more clearly understand the financial
situation and outlook of the Daily
Palo Alto, I wish to explain a few
facts in conjunction with the financial
report of the Daily Palo Alto as print
ed in today's paper.
There is nothing complicated about
it. Though the Daily ran at a loss
last quarter, there is actually no debt
at present, of the surplus left over
from last ypar's profits.
On October 1, 1920, the Daily had a
surplus of $592.11, available as a mar
gin to run on. In the Fall quarter
the paper showed a defiicit of $292.00,
as shown to today's report. This de-1
ficit was largely the result of United
Press wire service and excessively
high printing rates. The paper only
used 294 dollars of its surplus and has
the remainder left.
The Daily Palo Alto is on a sound
financial basis at present. A slight
profit was shown in January due to
most stringent economy in all depart
ments, and a closely matched make
up on the part of the editorial staff.
No large profit can ever be expected
from the present size of paper and the
present subscription rates, but with
a continuance and a pick-up in busi
ness conditions, there is no reason
to believe that the paper cannot meet
all ita expenses and possible a
small surplus for expansion.
