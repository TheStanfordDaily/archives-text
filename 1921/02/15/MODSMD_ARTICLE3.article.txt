# MISSIONARY ASKS AID FOR LABRADOR PEOPLE
## Sir Wilfred Grenfell Speaks of Suffering in Northland and Praises Colleges' Work 
### WYLIE KILPATRICK, '23 
"A laboratory in human service" was
the phrase used by Sir Wilfred T. Grer<-
fell to describe Labrador in an inter
view Sunday afternoon. "Cut off in
many respects from the rest of the
world, tlie Labrador people preseril a
problem of relief which calls for the
direct application of Christianity.'"

Tht famous medical missionary was
reticent when speaking of his personal
share in alleviating suffering on tlic
northeastern coast of Canada, but was
fran'K in praising the work of his asso
ciates particularly the volunteer students
from American universities. '""Nearly a
hundred men from tlie colleges of 'ihe
United States,' said Dr. GrenfeTl, "'come
to Labrador every summer to aid in'ihe
hospitals or on the boats," Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton have each orgahitcd

societies to provide a quota oi men for
the summer wwrk.

A few of the western universities, m
eluding Stanford and the University of
California, occasionally furnish vohm
teer workers. "Hot only do tire â€¢sttulralts
form the staffs for ten summer schools,
hut they are nurses'and surgical assist
ants on ships ami in hospitals.
Tne Labrador mission has. had a -pv
euliar appeal ti* American university
men for many years because of the per
sonality of its head. As a student at
Oxford 'University, Dr. GrenfeTl was
an all-around athlete, captain of tin 1
rugby team, oarsman on the varsity
eight, and shot-putter. Transition from
lie life of a young doctor in London
to that of a missionary in Labrador was
unexpected. 'Meeting the fishermen of
Billingsgate, his interest in relieving
their condition led him to ship out as a
sailor for several years on the North
Sea. A trip to Labrador revealed the
needs of its isolated people, and woVk
for the fishermen later extended to the
inland region of the country.
American universities have not been
slow in responding to the campaign for
raising a permanent endowment for the
C renfell mission. "Tne initiative in sub
scribing funds is left entirely to the stu
dent bodies," said the Labrador mission
ary- The Yale students a few days ago
set a quota of $5,000 which they intend
to subscribe. An equal amount was
raised in one evening at Princeton.
The universities of the west are re
sponding in a like manner. President
Barrows of the University of California
last week stated that a drive would be
shortly started on the Berkeley campus.
Donations from Stanford were received
at the Assembly Hall Sunday evening j
and additional amounts are being for
warded to Mr. W. H. Crocker, Crocker
National Bank, San Francisco.
