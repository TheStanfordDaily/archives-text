# INTRAMURAL RUGBY TEAMS LINE UP FOR GAME ON THURSDAY
## 
### 
Rugby comes into its own as a
regular intramural sport this week,
as the busketball contests draw to a
close, and various living groups have
already been arranged to form teams ;
for games that are to be played be- 1
ginning Thursday.
Three teams have been chosen from
the groups. They are as follows: !
Team A, Capt. 1). M. Wallace, includes 1
Chi Psi, Delta Chi, Phi Delta Theta,
Kappa Sigma, Kappa Alpha, Sigma
Nu, Phi Kappa Sigma, Alpha Delta

Doe, Beta Theta Pi, S. A. E., Sigma
Sigma Phi, Alpha Kappa Lambda,
Encina. Team C, Capt. Phil Clark,

Gamma Delta, Delta Tau Delta, Zeta
Psi, Thesa Chi, Sequoia.
The first game will be held Thurs
day afternoon at 4:39, between Team
A, under Captain Wallace, and Team
B, under Captain Doe. The former
will have its team made up from nine |
organizations, while the latter, al
though including men from only eight
living groups, will have all Encina to
pick from, so the game should be a
fairly even one.
The important thing to be announced !
is that everyone on all three teams
must be out Wednesday afternoon to
practice and get equipment. Interest
in the series is high and the even
matching of the teams forecast close
and fast games.
