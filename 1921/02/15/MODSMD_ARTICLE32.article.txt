year 1919-20 lias just been made public.

to every member of the Alumni Asso
ciation of the University.
Practically all the items included by
President Wilbur in his own particular
report have already been made public
through announcement of University
action in the public press, but the 304-
page volume containing his report and
various appendices is made notable by
the fact that in it for the lirst time the
' complete financial condition of Stanford
University is made public in minute de
tail through the report of the Treasurer
of the University, Timothy Hopkins.
In his report Treasurer Hopkins
points out that the sale of the Vina and
. Durham ranches and the investment of
the proceeds in bonds, together with
the investment in bonds of all other
available money, have enabled the Uni
versity to pull through the trying wtir
period with a success that would have
been impossible otherwise, since the
original trust consisted largely of these
and other real estate holdings and of
railway bonds with comparatively low
income. He says that a study is being
constantly made of the University's in
vestments in the endeavor to still fur
ther increase their yield.
Treasurer Hopkins' report closes with
an expression of appreciation of the
, gifts that have been received by the
University since its foundation and the
hope that Stanford i'may have that
financial support that has been the
I source of inspiration and growth to other
! privately owned universities of the
United States."
