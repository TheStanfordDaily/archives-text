Mr. Hall McAllister Griffiths, Chair

California, 1529 Shattuck Ave., Ber
keley, Cal.- —Dear Mr. Griffiths: —In
regard to California-Stanford debating
relations of the current year Debat
ing Coach Miller L. McClintock and
myself wish to call attention to the
following:
The regular procedure on the part
of California this year in continuing
the inter-collegiate contest with Stan
ford as outlined by the debating con
tract, and as observed in the past, re
quired thutr California tender to Stan
ford in the very early part of the
Vail Term, positively not later than
October 10th, a question for the de
bate. This year Stanford did not hear
from California though every effort
was made to reaeh authorities at
Berkeley. Meanwhile we learned that
California had selected a team to
Stanford.

when The (late for the con
test was less Vhan a month away, 1
received California's ch'oice of a qties
i tion. After consulting at once with
faculty memtfers and leading debaters
: I was convinced that the question was
i not agreeabV; to us and made a spe
| eial trip to Berkeley to inform the j
representatives there. California in i
a few days 'informedme that no change j
| in the question would be considered,;
I notwithstanding it has never been the
custom fui either university to dictate
the suhjert for detißte.
Then, solely because I did not care
to sw; a debate o( such long stanSingl
dropped 1 informed the California j
authorities that we would meet, 'iliem j
on The question submitted and that
i we -would prefer ihat the dite of the
contest be moved forward to -allow one i
more week of preparation. California!
declined spying no "fct'bate was possible j
before 'Christmas.
After eommunicatlion with Coach
McfCHntcrifc who was then on leave of
absence, 'f suggested that Stanford
would hear any proposal from Cali
fornia relative to holding the debate
during the early Winter Term. Cali
fornia failed to answer.
I ,
After a thorough review <cof the
events leading to the present status j
of debating relations regarding this
contestt, Coach McChntock anh my-j
self are of the opinion that the mat-!
ter of this debate shwuild be dropped I
definitely.

Mr. Hall McAllister Griffiths, Chair
man, Debating Council, University of
California, 1529 Shattuck Ave., Ber
keley, Cal.- —Dear Mr. Griffiths: —In
regard to California-Stanford debating
relations of the current year Debat
ing Coach Miller L. McClintock and
myself wish to call attention to the
following:
The regular procedure on the part
of California this year in continuing
the inter-collegiate contest with Stan
ford as outlined by the debating con
tract, and as observed in the past, re
quired thutr California tender to Stan
ford in the very early part of the
Vail Term, positively not later than
October 10th, a question for the de
bate. This year Stanford did not hear
from California though every effort
was made to reaeh authorities at
Berkeley. Meanwhile we learned that
California had selected a team to
Stanford.

when The (late for the con
test was less Vhan a month away, 1
received California's ch'oice of a qties
i tion. After consulting at once with
faculty memtfers and leading debaters
: I was convinced that the question was
i not agreeabV; to us and made a spe
| eial trip to Berkeley to inform the j
representatives there. California in i
a few days 'informedme that no change j
| in the question would be considered,;
I notwithstanding it has never been the
custom fui either university to dictate
the suhjert for detißte.
Then, solely because I did not care
to sw; a debate o( such long stanSingl
dropped 1 informed the California j
authorities that we would meet, 'iliem j
on The question submitted and that
i we -would prefer ihat the dite of the
contest be moved forward to -allow one i
more week of preparation. California!
declined spying no "fct'bate was possible j
before 'Christmas.
After eommunicatlion with Coach
McfCHntcrifc who was then on leave of
absence, 'f suggested that Stanford
would hear any proposal from Cali
fornia relative to holding the debate
during the early Winter Term. Cali
fornia failed to answer.
I ,
After a thorough review <cof the
events leading to the present status j
of debating relations regarding this
contestt, Coach McChntock anh my-j
self are of the opinion that the mat-!
ter of this debate shwuild be dropped I
definitely.
If next yea*, or in tlie future the
University of California considers it j
wise that the 'California-Stanford de
bate shtmld be held according to fhe
customary regulations and procedure, j
Stanfoid will be glad to hear from!
California on the subject.
