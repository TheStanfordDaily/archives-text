# FRESHMEN PLAY SECOND GAME OF SERIES TONIGHT
## Local Babes Will Do Battle to Bring Home Chance for a Last Attempt to Gain Title 
### 
Duffy Seay and his freshmen left this
afternoon on the 3:11 train for San
Francisco, en route to the California
campus, where they will do their utmost
tonight to avenge their defeat in the last
game. The Babes have their last chance
tonight to make a three-game series out
of the freshman intercollegiate basket
ball. The game will be in Harmon
Gymnasium at U. C. at 8 p. m.
Last night the freshmen went through
a light signal practice. The first string,
consisting of Captain Jansen, McHose,
Granger, Smith, and Campbell, ran for
mations and signals for most of the
practice time, and then worked with a
few changes from the substitutes.
Field goal-shooting from difficult
angles has been the work of the past
week, because the Babes found in the
last game that they could not employ
the passing rush game that they have
used so far this season when up against
a team as fast and heavy as the Califor
nians. Better basket work marked the
performance last night and the quintet
this evening will rely on that to make
the points rather than the chance help
of accurate shooting of foul baskets.
The freshmen are at a disadvantage
the same as the Bruin Cubs suffered in
the last game here. They have never
seen the California court and will be
totally unfamiliar with the ground there.
They are at the height of their training
now, though, and are prepared to give
everything they have tonight in an en
deavor to turn the tables on the Blue
and Gold and bring home a chance to
play one more game. If there should be
another game in the series it will be
played on the local court at the end of
this week or next.
