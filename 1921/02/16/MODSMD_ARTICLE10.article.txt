# MONTENEGRO DESCRIBED IN FAIRCLOUGH LECTURE
## Mountain Range Responsible for "Adriatic Question"; Dalmation Coast Described 
### 
Last night in the Little Theater Pro
fessor H. R. Fairclough of the Latin
department gave his illustrated lecture
on "Montenegro and the Dalmatian
Coast," and carried his hearers back in
spirit to the formation of those little
Adriatic kingdoms centuries before the
birth of Christ.
Dr. Fairclough briefly sketched the
geographical situation o'f Jugo-Slavia
and then ,in turn, touched upon the
economic and political problems conÂ®
fronting the people of that region.
"The fa'ct that Jugo-Slavia is divided
into two parts by a mountain range,- is
responsible for the so-called Adriatic
question," continued Dr. Fairclough.
"The eastern section is very fertile and
extremely rich, while the western part
consists only of dry, arid mountain
ranges. The former is known as Serbia,
while the latter represents the tiny king
dom of Montenegro."
The speaker went back with his audi
ence to that far-off day when Julius
Caesar had been the first proctorator of
Dalmatia and had had constructed some
of the very roads that the Dalmatian
peasants use today. He stated that
Aurelian, Claudius IT, Diocletian, and
scores of others of the great Roman
emperors had originally come from this
picturesque territory. He brought the
story on down through the Middle Ages,
pointing out how the intervening moun
tain range had resulted in the advent of
a religious strife among the people that
has never entirely been stamped out.
Then how the coast had fallen before
the great Ottoman empire, and how the
Montenegrans through live centuries of
attack and subjugation had maintained
their independence.
"The Montenegrans are a very lovable
people," continued Dr. Faiclough, "and
although some consider their country a
very unattractive place, 1 think that it
compares very favorably with Switzer
land and its wonderful Alps."
"The people are considered also by
some as an illiterate group. It may in
terest you to know that twenty years
after the Caxton press in England, a
second printing press was operating in
this little country."
In conclusion. Dr. Fairclough quoted
the sonnet written by Alfred Tennyson
in honor of the people of Montenegro.
Following the lecture proper a series of
highly interesting slides, secured by the
doctor abroad, were projected on the
screen, relative to the life of the people
and the condition of these minute
Adriatic countries.
