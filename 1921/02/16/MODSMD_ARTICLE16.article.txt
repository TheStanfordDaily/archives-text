# STANFORD QUINTET TRIUMPHS OVER WASHINGTON STATE COUGARS AFTER
## TWO EXTRA PERIODS OF PLAY, 42-37 Davies Ties Score With Foul Shot After Final Gun; Carver Stars; W.S.C. Leads 29-6 at Half 
### 
Coach Powell's cage warriors nosed out the Washington State Cougars
after two extra periods of play and won the first game of the two-games
series in Pullman last night by a score of 42 to 37. The game was the
hardest and most exciting that the Cardinal quintet has engaged in this
season.
The score at half time was 29 to 6 in favor of the Washington State.
After the ten-minute rest period the Stanford men came back and held the
northerners to six points while they piled up twenty-two points in rapid
order... As the final gun sounded the score waq 32 to 31 but a Washington
State player fouled. Jimmy Davies took the pellet and toed the mark to
shoot for the basket after the game was officially over. He made it and
the score was tied at 32 points all.

The teams played an extra five min
utes to decide the winner but each
contingent was playing such an ex
cellent brand of ball and the score was
again a tie at the end of the extra
period with 34 all. Another extra
period was necessary but this time
the red-shirted men got in their deadly
work and romped away with the long
end of a 42 to 37 score.
Jimmy Davies and Ralph Carver,
playing center for Bert Mills, were
the stars of the game. Carver was
responsible for a great many of the
Cardinal points, while Davies' shot
that tied the score required consider
able nerve and accuracy.
Stanford made twenty-six fouls,
seventeen of which were converted by
the Cougars. A foul on Righter, con
verted by Mclvor, put the Washington
team one point in the . lead one minute
before the final gun. Just before time,
Friel fouled by running with the ball.
With everything depending on his
throw, Davies shot true and the game
was tied 32 all.
The Cardinal line-up last night was
Righter and Davies, forwards; Ralph
Carver, center; Richmond and Adams,
guards. Bert Mills may be ready for
the second game tonight. He was
not in the best of shape when the
team departed and it is possible that
Coach Powell is saving him for the
series with the University of Wash
ington, which begin Friday night, in
Seattle.
Tonight the two teams""will play
again on the same court and with the
advantage of one victory the Powell
ites should win again. This Washing
ton State team is evidently a high
powered outfit and the second game
will doubtlessly be another nerve
wrecking affair.
