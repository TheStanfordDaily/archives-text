# JUNIOR TEAM SCORES THIRD VICTORY IN BASKETBALL SERIES
## 
### 
The junior women's basketball
team scored their third straight, vic
tory yesterday afternoon when they
defeated the seniors by a score of 30
to 6. The team work and passing of
Ihe junior team was not up to par
and throughout the game there was a
great deal of high and wild passing
on both sides, which was probably
due to the slippery condition of the
field.
Imogene Aten, playing forward for
the juniors threw seven of the fifteen
baskets and Lena Tavernetti five.
Margaret Younglove, who was placed
in the forward position during the
last seven minutes of the play threw
the other two. Carol Elsey made the
first four points for the seniors dur
ing the first half of the match and
Hester Proctor the remaining two
points.
The final game of the preliminary
round will be played tomorrow be
tween the freshmen and sophomore
teams. So far in the present series
theso two teams have tied for second
place. Both teams have well-develop
ed systems of passing and thorough
team work. Judging by previous
games the match tomorrow will be
hard fought and speedy.

terday were:
Seniors —Hedges. Lorimer. Pease,
McGee, West, Jones, Elsey and Proc
tor.
