# UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS SPEAK
## 
### 
For the first time since the founding of Stanford, the University's
entire financial status is made public in a complete 304-page volume
just issued, containing rejjorts of the President and other university
officials. Many alumni have asked for just such a statement by which
they could accurately familiarize themselves with the problems of the
administration. Graduates have sometimes declared unequivocally
against steps that were taken, noticeably tuition, giving as a ground their
"belief" that it was not necessary to raise money in that way. A close
study of the report will convince many that tuition was the only possible
expedient in the administration of a university of which we would wish
to be members.
Significant in the report is the sale of the Vina and Durham ranches
and the investment iti bonds of "all available money"; indicating that
there are no longer landed estates convertible into securities bearing
greater income. In other words the endowment now renders practically
the greatest return possible, and additional income can be secured only
from other sources, namely students, alumni, and the public.
it is not strange then that Treasurer Hopkins hopes that Stanford
may have "that financial support which has been the source of inspira
tion and growth to other privately owned universities." Without such
support, Stanford's normal healthy growth apparently must stop. Stan
ford 1 can expect such support only from a loyal graduate body, or from
a properly informed public. The general impression has long prevailed
that Stanford is a wealthy institution. Treasurer Hopkins' report should
go a long way in correcting a false impression as to the university's
financial assets, and should prove valuable in securing future public
support. / ,
