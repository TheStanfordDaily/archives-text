# TRACK ASSOCIATION PROPOSES CHANGES IN AMATEUR EVENTS
## 
### 
The committee on track events of
the International Collegiate American
Amateur Athletics Association has
suggested several changes to be in
corporated into the constitution of
the association at the next regular
meeting early in March.
It is proposed to make the standard
440 hurdle a three foot hurdle, in ad
dition to the 2 1-2 and 3 1-2-foot hurd
les now in use. They also suggest
that the three-mile run be made a
new and regular track event. Up to
this time the javelin throw has not
been usually observed as a track
event in the east. The committee
proposes to make this a universal
event throughout the country.
Stanford is allowed three repre
sentatives at the gathering next month
but it is improbable that any men
from here will attend.
