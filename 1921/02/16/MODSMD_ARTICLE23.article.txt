# LIFE OF PROFESSOR WILLIS IS LONG TRAIL OF TRAVEL
## 
### 
The life of Bailey Willis, Professor
of Geology, is best described as a long
trail. His travels have taken him
to the ends of the earth and through
many and varied experiences to the
position he now occupies, in the Uni
versity.
Professor Willis is the son of the
poet Nathaniel P. Willis and spent his
early youth in a picturesque home at
Idlewild-on-the-Hudson, near New
York. After his father's death he
went to England and Germany, where
he spent four years before returning
to America to enter Columbia Uni
versity He values his German train
ing because of its thoroughness. It
laid the foundation of all his later
work in sound habits of study. In
1878 he took the degree of Mining
Engineer and in '79 that of Civil En
gineer at Columbia, where he had
been strongly influenced by J. S. New
berry, Professor of Geology.
His first geologic work was done in
the eastern states, ranging from
Michigan to Georgia, examining and
sampling iron ores. In 18S1 the North
ern Pacific Railway Company orga
nized a great survey of the for North-
West tributary to the railroad, and
young Willis was put in charge of
the exploration of Oregon and Wash
ington, especially with reference to
coal resources. Here he came to know
the pioneer life of the West and to
value that loyalty to friendship which
is a characteristic of good fellowship
among even the roughest of men on
tlje frontier.
From 1884 to 1902 Professor Willis
was an active member of the United
States Geological Survey and ad
vanced from Assistant Geologist to the
position of. Chief Geologist and Assist
ant Director. His field work embraced
geologic studies in all parts of the
United States and was supplemented
by research into problems relating to
the structure and history of the con
tinent. In these studies he was close
ly associated with the great leaders
in geologic science of that time, in
cluding G. K. Gilbert, one of the ablest
minds in American geology.
In 1902 he "shed the harness of a

government} mule" as Professor Willis
put it, and for a dozen years follow
ing he was engaged in travel and ex
-1 ploration. He re-visited Europe and
journeyed through Russia and Siberia
to China. Tn the latter country he
took a walk of about 2000 miles, pene
trating far into the interior. In in
timate association with the Chinese,
Professor Willis came to recognize
the sterling virtues of that people and
also the great difference between a
nation which looks ever backwards
and his own, which regardless of
history, looks only forward.
After several years spent in the
studies suggested by his Asiatic work,
Mr. Willis embraced an opportunity
to visit South America. He was sent
to Argentina in 19101 to represent the
Smithsonian Institution at the Sci
entific Congress of Buenos Aires and
while there he accepted the position
of Consulting Geologist to the Argen
tine Government, which he held for
four years. He made an economic
survey of Patagonia, located railways,
studied water supply and water power
planned an industrial city. He
also visited many other parts of
South America. His early experience
in the West proved of great service
to him on the South American fronti
er, for there again he always found
men responsive to a square deal.
The World War ended the Argen
tine work. In 1915 Professor Willis
came to Stanford on the invitation of
Dr. Branner to become his successor,
the two geologists having long been
friends. Mr. Willis considers this in
vitation the highest compliment of
his career. In his work in the Uni
versity, he has endeavored to live up
to the Stanford ideal, that a professor
shall be an investigator as well as an
instructor and he has been constantly
active in geologic research and its
practicable application.
"It is a long trail to look back over,
but good comrades have been mine
on every mile and new ones are con
stantly falling into line. In their
eompany the trail is all too short,"
said Dr. Willis.
