The Redwood City Fathers have

The following sign caught the eye
of Cautious "For Sale —
Fresh-laid eggs and pullets." Says

City papers declare that California
won from thrj Aggies last night in a
spectacular finish. California was
four points in arrears at the end of
the first half. According to the same
source of Information, Stanford mere

points at the end of the half. We get
the same impression from Gulliver's
Travels. "With an enormous leap of
six and three-e'ghths Inches, the little
