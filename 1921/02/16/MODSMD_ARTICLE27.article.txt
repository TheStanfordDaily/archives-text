# WORK ON SCENES IN JAPANESE DRAMA IS BEGUN BY STEWART
## 
### 
Scenic arrangement and scene paint
ing has been started under the direc
tion of Colman Stewart, stage man
ager, for the English Club play, "The
Yellow Jacket," to be produced on
March 8, in the Assembly Hall. Pic
tures of the original settings used in
the first production of the drama have
been received and the arrangement
here will be a complete reproduction.
Warren D. Allen, University Organ
ist, has been lending his ability to
plan the musical part of the play.
Incidental music which follows direct
ly with the action of the play is one
of the features of Chinese convention
al drama. Richard Malaby, who will
also direct, is endeavoring to make
a full imitation of the "yellow man's
orchestra."
The Celestial customs which are
clearly depicted in the Chinese play,
are truly executed. Although to the
native of China the drama may hold
pathos, but to the American theater
goer, the acting seems to have an ad
verse reaction on his emotion. Humor
may be found in the most serious
parts and novelty is the keynote to
the conventional play.
The English Club chose "The Yellow
Jacket" to produce a play which
would be different. The production
is known the world over and has been
staged in the leading theatres of the
world's capitals. It will be a play
worth while seeing and gives assur
ance of pleasing the campus audience.
