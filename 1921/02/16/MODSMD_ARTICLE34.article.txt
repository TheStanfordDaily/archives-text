# Euphronia Will Hold Debate Tryouts Tonight
## 
### 
Euphronia Debating Society will hold
its tryouts ,for the inter-society debate
for tonight at the regular meeting
in Room 50 of the Education Building.
All members of the society may try for
the team and no previous signing of
names will be required. The question
is: "Resolved, that the death penalty
be abolished in the State of California."
This is one of the current problems of
the day and much can be said for both
sides. President Martin requests that
all members be present to help put some
pep in the discussion.
