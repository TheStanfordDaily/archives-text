# MEDIC QUINTET WINS FROM KAPPA SIGMA IN INTRAMURAL GAME
## 
### 
Boosters of the Medic intramural
quintet freely predicted their team would
win the campus championship after the
Young Docs snowed under the Kappa
Sigma five 18 to 2 yesterday afternoon.
The Alpha Delta Phis defeated the Phi
Gamma Delta basketers 21 to 2, and the
Delta Upsilon five downed the Breakers
20 to 13.
Brown starred at forward for the
Medics. His playing was exceptionally
fast and his passing and shooting were
accurate. Brown was captain of the
Morningside College quintet last year.
Hey and Ward, playing guard for the
Kappa Sigmas, held the Medics down to
four points in the first period, which
ended 4-2. Fairchild played a hard game
against larger men and scored the lone
basket for the Kappa Sigs. Dake and
Farrish were so closely guarded that
their shots at the goal were few and
generally muffed.
The Alpha Delta Phi quintet had lit
tle trouble defeating the Phi Gamma
Deltas, thus maintaining their unbroken
record of victories. The score at the
end of the first half stood 8-0 favoring
the Alpha Delts. The second half saw
the number more than doubled, while
the Fijis scored two points on a basket
by Colvin.
Neer and Gcrson divided honors in
point winning for the Alpha Delts.
Neer was constantly after the ball on
the defense, and managed to shake loose
from his guard on the offense. Gerson
was always ready to receive the ball
from Pollard when the latter recovered
it under his own goal. This proved a
big factor in the scoring of the Alpha
Delts, giving them time to get the Neer-
Gerson-Phelps combination started down
the court.
Pollard and Kline were successful in
keeping the Fiji forwards covered
throughout the game. Pollard scored
two baskets. His work showed up well
during the whole game. Pollard s for
mer service on the varsity gave the fans
a chance to compare the intramural and
intercollegiate brands of basketing. The
general opinion voiced yesterday was
that several men on the intramural
teams are varsity caliber.
The D. U-Breakers game started out
as a runaway for the fraternity men,
and the first half ended 8 to 1 in their
favor. The Breakers rallied in the sec
ond period and ran up 12 points while
the Row men were rubbing their eyes.
Then the D. L'.'s realized they had to
fight for the game, so got busy and piled
up 12 counts of their own. Ihe game
ended 20 13 with the D. U. quintet on
top.

the Alpha Delts. The second half saw
the number more than doubled, while
the Fijis scored two points on a basket
by Colvin.
Neer and Gcrson divided honors in
point winning for the Alpha Delts.
Neer was constantly after the ball on
the defense, and managed to shake loose
from his guard on the offense. Gerson
was always ready to receive the ball
from Pollard when the latter recovered
it under his own goal. This proved a
big factor in the scoring of the Alpha
Delts, giving them time to get the Neer-
Gerson-Phelps combination started down
the court.
Pollard and Kline were successful in
keeping the Fiji forwards covered
throughout the game. Pollard scored
two baskets. His work showed up well
during the whole game. Pollard s for
mer service on the varsity gave the fans
a chance to compare the intramural and
intercollegiate brands of basketing. The
general opinion voiced yesterday was
that several men on the intramural
teams are varsity caliber.
The D. U-Breakers game started out
as a runaway for the fraternity men,
and the first half ended 8 to 1 in their
favor. The Breakers rallied in the sec
ond period and ran up 12 points while
the Row men were rubbing their eyes.
Then the D. L'.'s realized they had to
fight for the game, so got busy and piled
up 12 counts of their own. Ihe game
ended 20 13 with the D. U. quintet on
top.
