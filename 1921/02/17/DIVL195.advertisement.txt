WHY YEAST IS BEING USED AS A CONDITIONER
One Vital Element Without Which We Cannot
"KEEP FIT"
This new discovery of science Is startling thousands of men and
women every day. Are we getting enough of this single element,
this Vitamine, in our everyday meals? Without it, scientists are
agreed, we fall off in health. A number of foods, notably spinach,
contain this Vitamine, but from many of our everyday foods it has
been removed by the process of manufacture or preparation.
The richest known source of this vitamine is yeast—just the familiar
little cake of Fleischmann's Yeast. That is why thousands of men
and women are taking yeast to correct complaints which often come
with lowered vitality and to maintain natural, vigorous health.
