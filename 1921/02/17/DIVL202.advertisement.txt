" When May Students II
Buy Jewelry? jj|
By f. F. Haight, Adv. Mgr. Samuels Jewelry Co.
Mighty little jewelry was bought by undergrads when I was
in College. A fountain pen, a watch and a frat pin was
about the limit. Occasionally some resplendent co-ed
blossomed forth with a solitaire, the gift of an unusually
opulent upper classman. But most of us had to wait a year
or two after going to work before we made the grade. Fact
is, we didn't have the money in those days and in that coun
try, unless we earned it ourselves.
Nowadays, I understand, College boys in California are fre
quently blessed with wealthy parents and it is not incon
ceivable that they may, with propriety, purchase an oc
casional piece of jewelry for a birthday or other gift, or
a diamond engagement ring. But however wealthy, there's
a limit set by good taste. What is that limit? I want to
know. And who better than the students themselves, is
qualified to inform me? For the best answer to this ques
tion from a Stanford student this firm will award a prize
of $25.00 cash. Second and third prizes of $15.00 and
$10.00. It costs nothing to compete. Full details of the
conditions will be sent upon request. II
