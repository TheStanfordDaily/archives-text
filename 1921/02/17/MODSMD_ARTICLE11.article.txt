# MEDICS, D.U. AND PHI DELIS MAINTAIN LEAD
## Burkhart, Beaver, Fairchild, Carver and Lacey Star in Intra-Mural Court Contest 
### 
Playing their usual fast brand of
basketball, the Medic quintet defeated
the Chi Psis 11 to 8 yesterday afternoon
on the varsity court in one of the hard
esf battles of the whole intramural
series. The Delta Upsilon five easily
won from the Phi Gamma Deltas with
a 5 to 1 score. The Phi Delta Theta
team nosed out the fighting Kappa
Sigma quintet in the last minute of play
by a penalty throw. The score was
7 to 6.
All games scheduled for today have
been postponed until Saturday on ac
count of the finish of the intramural
boxing tournament being held on the
basketball court.
Tomorrow the Medics meet the Fijis,
the Delta Upsilon and Alpha Delta Phi
quintets tangle, and the Chi Psi five bat
tles Phi Delta Theta. The last-named
contest will be a keen fight, according
to fan talk.
Burkhart was chief point winner for
the Medic five yesterday. He converted
three out of five penalty throws, and
made a neat basket on a long try from
the side line. Love played a fast game
in the first half, but slowed up later in
the game. His basket in the first few
minutes of play gave the Docs the lead,
which they held throughout the re
mainder of the game.
Baker and Beaver worked their strong
defensive play in the usual effective
manner. Beaver's judgment of the Chi
Psis' teamwork saved the day for his
quintet several times when a score
seemed certain.
The Phi Delt-Kappa Sigma contest
started like a runaway for the Phi
Delts. Pigott scoring a basket in the
first ten seconds. Hey and Ward, the
Kappa Sigma guards, quickly tightened
and prevented further field goals during
the first period. Parish and Dake had
trouble getting away from their oppo
nents. This prevented teamwork on the
part of the Kappa Signias and left Fair
child to put across most of the offensive
work in the first half. This he did by
long and fast dribbling runs, but Aubert
and Plavter forced him to resort to long
shots, none of which scored. The score
at the end of the first half was 3-0 for
the Phi Delts. and they kept their lead,
winning 7 to 6.
The Delta Upsilon contest with the
Phi Deltas belonged to the D.
U.'s from the first. Guarding on both
sides was close, especially in the second
period, when only one point was scored
by the Delta Upsilon five, and none by
the Fijis.
Patrick, Carver, and Lacey showed
good teamwork on the offense, but had
trouble finding the hoop. Carpenter,
Miller, Clark, and Baker were full of
fight on the defense.
