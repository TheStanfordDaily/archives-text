# U. C. SHOWS LARGE NET PROFIT ON ATHLETICS
## 
### 
The University of California, with a
net profit on athletics for the year just
ended of $52,928.60, is far ahead of any
of the other universities in the country
in respect to athletic finances. The re
port shows that football contributed the
hulk of the receipts, $79,453.77 coming
from this source. Football, track, box
ing, and rugby were financially success
ful. while the other sports were run at
a loss.
The annual athletic reports of Harv
ard and Princeton, which have just been
made public, show a more unsuccessful
financial result. Although Harvard took
in $174,578.28, the expenses amounted to
more than that, and there was a deficit
of $6,343.44. Football and baseball were
the only sports which showed a profit.
Princeton also came out on the wrong
side of the ledger to the extent of
$5,431 45. Crew in all three universities
was the most expensive undertaking.
