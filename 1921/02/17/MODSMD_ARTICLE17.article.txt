# FROM STUDENT TO ALUMNUS
## 
### 
Stanford's limitd income is set forth in the statement of the
University officials. The Stanford of the future must receive sup
port from the alumni or from the public. Substantial support will
not be forthcoming' from a graduate body which does not realize' the
significance of the problem with which the administration is deal
ing, and which does not entertain a keen pro-university feeling; and
certainly public support will not gravitate toward an institution
whose alumni are not actively favorable toward it.
Students have a great deal to do with alumni attitude. The
student atmosphere inevitably reflects among ' the graduates of
Stanford. Careless student expression often leads to misunder
standing among the alumni; and hastily formed and erroneous cam
pus opinion may go a long way and do much damage before it can
be corrected.
A student recognition of these tendencies and attempt by action
and expression to reflect always the true loyalty of the campus com
munity, together with assumption on graduation of fair, whole
hearted, and active university support, may do much to foster the
solid pro-Stanford alumni spirit that will aid materially in build
ing the future Stanford we expect to know.
