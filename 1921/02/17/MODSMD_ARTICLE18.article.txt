# NOT UNLESS WE WANT IT

### 
No one will force the honor system on, the students of Stanford.
It is generally granted that the honor principle is fair to students
and professors; that Stanford men will observe it; that freshmen,
after explanation at a general assembly, and the example of upper
classmen, would not violate it; that it operates to the best of ad
vantage in those departments where it is used; and that all stu
dents favor it, passively.
But all this will not bring about a complete honor system, un
less the students m those departments where it does not exist ask
for it. In the Law department, the law students enforce the system.
In Geology and Mining, the Geology and Mining Society is respons
ible for the principle.
If the members of the departments now using the old system
prefer to continue under it, they may do so by remaining indiffer
ent, but if they want to come into the honor system class, they
must take the initiative and request the department officials that the
change be made.
Student initiative alone will make Stanford wholly an "honor"
university.

COACH JOE MURPHY has scheduled a regular carnival of argu

Murphy's men will go against California before long, and the ex

the pick of the 800 tryoutees at Berkeley who are battling for a

THE VARSITY come-back against Washington State was typical
of what is expected of Stanford teams. The men came through and
took the series after the Cougars had gained an almost insurmount
able lead against them. Last night's contest showed the Cardinal
from the start an unbeatable team, and the campus may rest a little
more easily while awaiting the news from the University of Wash
ington.
