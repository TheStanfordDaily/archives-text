# PROFESSOR BEACH SPEAKS OF CHANGES AT STANFORD
## 
### 
Walter Greenwood Beach, professor
of social science, returned to Stanford
as a professor at the beginning of the
fall quarter of last year. Professor
Beach attended Stanford during the
years 1897-98, taking up graduate work
in connection with his chosen profession,
that of a doctor.
Unfortunately, his health was not
equal to the strain and he was forced to
abandon his ambition. Professor Beach
has since been teaching, except for a
short time when he was engaged in
business, which he found distasteful. He
says that he finds teaching more to his
liking than any other work that he has
experienced.
Professor Beach received most of his
education in the East. He has a Bach
elor of Arts degree from Marietta Col
lege in Ohio, and also one from Harv
ard University. His Master of Arts de
gree was received from Harvard in
1892. From 1893 to 1897 he was pro
fessor of philosophy and history at the
Marietta College for Women. After he
left Marietta he came to Stanford as a
student.
He said that the Stanford to which he
returned last fall seemed very different
to him from the Stanford which he at

tended as a graduate student. Larger
registration is not the only difference
that is noticeable. Many changes in liv
ing conditions, the attitude of the stu
dents, and the fact that more people
come to college than formerly did, be
cause it is the fashion to do so, are the
most noticeable differences. The student
of the time when he attended Stanford
came here because it could give him
what lie wanted along educational lines,
whereas nowadays a student is just as
liable to register because a friend did
and there was nothing better to do,
according to Professor Beach. This in
crease in registration decreases the
chance for individual work and is one
result of evolution which is not an ad
vancement, in his estimation.
The year following his studies at
Stanford, Professor Beach accepted an
assistant professorship at Washington
University and was successively pro
fessor and head of the department of
history and economics. In 1910 he was
appointed professor of social sciences
in Washington State College and served
in that capacity until 1917, when he was
made dean of the College of Science
and Arts of the same institution. It was
this position that he left to come to Stan
ford.
