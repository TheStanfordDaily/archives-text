# TRANSITIONS FROM TRAGEDY TO HUMOR IN 'YELLOW JACKET'
## 
### 
Humor —a quiet, twinkling humor—
that alternately shocks by its cynicism
and amuses by its cleverness, is one of
the main ingredients in the "Yellow
Jacket," the English Club play which
will be presented on Marcli 8. Far from
being a dull, dreary "classic," the "Yel
low Jacket" is filled with human touches
and jumps "from the sublime to the
ridiculous" in a most delightful manner.
As an example of the daring but
charming transitions in which the play
abounds, take this: the dashing young
hero, after overcoming untold horrors
in his efforts to reach the palace of the
usurper, cries out that he will "fling his
naked body against the castle walls." A
moment later the rich man's son, the
usurpter, rises from behind the red cur
tain that represents the mighty battle
ments and remarks to his audience:
"You have heard this youth's almost
indelicate threat."
The humor doesn't always come with
the same sudden break, but the gentle
fun and satire is suffused over the whole
scene. These little touches give the play
a piquancy rarely found in the conven
tional drama.
Indeed, it has the kind of humor that
you remember long after the show is
over—the kind that makes you chuckle
to yourself as you arc going down on
the Kampus Kar. It was this quality
•which so delighted European audiences
and made the "Yellow Jacket" one of
the biggest hits of the past decade.
Coach Gordon Davis says that the
local cast has entered into the spirit of
the play admirably and will give it a
real interpretation. They know how to
bring out its high lights and shadows
in a-way that assures the campus public
of an evening's real entertainment.
