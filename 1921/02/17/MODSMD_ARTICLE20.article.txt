"THE CAPTIVES," By Hugh Walpole.
N. Y. 1920.
For the second time within two
years, Mr. Walpole has been awarded
by the University of Edinburgh the
Tait Black prize for the most distin
guished recent British novel. The
former award was made to "The Sec
ret City," a study of the Russian re
volution; the latter to "The Captives,"
a purely English tale. In this there
is little to surprise those of us who
have come to think of this writer as
the one among the youngest novel
ists whose work is most certain to
prove worth while.
Mr. Walpole is a characteristic son
of our generation, in liking to deal
with serious problems, but not to solve
them. He has a keen sense of the
things that make difficulties for
youth—the eternal conflict between
youth and age, between the spirit of
adventure and that of duty. His per
ceptions are sound and sane, perhaps
a little over-serious, not positively
constructive, but both keen and sym
pathetic; and he is much truer to the
facts that many of his contemporaries,
because he does not exaggerate the
rule of sex, nor underestimates the
place of duty and of faith, in the game
of human life. This does not seem
Miat. he takes sides with the age
against youth, or duty against love;
he does not. But he sees both sides
fairly.
I have said that he comes to no
constructive conclusions. Yet there is
one conclusion which he is fond of
presenting, the same which formed
the theme of one of his best earlier
novels, "Fortitude." The heroine of
"Th."» Captives" has the quality which
Mr. Walpole described by that word,
and which he evidently thinks to be
youth's surest key to the mysterious
doors of life. Maggie was doomed
to be lonely and misunderstood, but
still knew that she had the
strength to "compel life to give her
what she wanted." Hence she knew
every kind of trouble except bitter
ness or despair—never those. "How
could you be bitter about people
when you were all in the same box,
all as ignorant, as blind, as eager to
do well, as fallible, as brave?"
This tells nothing of the story of
"The Captives," though there is a
real story, vigorous and varied, and
a rich array of vivid characters. But
those who are first of all looking for
a story will turn elsewhere. The
reader who likes fiction as a form of
thinking will find it, alive and sti
mulating, in this book.
