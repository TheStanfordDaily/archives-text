# COMMITTEE PLANS TO ASK FOR ADOPTION OF JUNIOR COLLEGE SYSTEM FOR STATE
## 
### 
If the plan of the committee ap
pointed by the California State Legis
lature to investigate the conditions of
the state institutions goes through, the
University of California will become a
school solely for upperclassmen and
graduate students. California now has
too many underclassmen, according to
the committee, and this will require an
entire change of California's system of
education,
In order that this change might be
come effective at once, the committee,
headed by H. C. Jones, '02, of San Jose,
has asked that the State Legislature
pass a law providing that all communi
ties with property assessed for ten mil
lions can have a junior college. These
junior colleges will give the first two
years of college work and will be run
in, connection with the present high
school system Students going to these
colleges will be required to take certain
courses which will prepare them to start
in business or to be admitted to any
college with a junior standing.
The new system will benefit students
who come to college and also offers a
little higher education for the man who
enters in the business world without col
lege training. It will eliminate a good
deal of the time wasted by the under
classmen in getting accustomed to col
lege ways and will lessen the jump be
tween universities and high school. It
will be the purpose of the junior col
leges to give the student a general edu
cation, leaving the state institutions in
which he can specialize.
In reviewing this question, the com
mittee found that there will have to be
some changes in the present college
systems, especially in athletics. The
intercollegiate law at present does not
allow transfers to compete on the ath
letic teams of a school. This would keep
all the men of the junior class from
entering into the sports and it would be
impossible to get good representative
teams from the senior class alone. Some
provision must be made for this, and at
the same time keep professionals out of
college athletics.
The committee figures that the lower
classmen cost the institutions more, and
cause, for the most part, the crowded
conditions of the universities. If the
men, then, who graduate from the junior
colleges of the state continue with their
education, the committee sees no rea
sons why the present high cost of educa
tion and crowded conditions cannot be
done away with altogether.
