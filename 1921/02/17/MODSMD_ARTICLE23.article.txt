Situated as we are at Stanford, with
a limited registration, surrounded by
wholesome tradition, bound together
by extremely strong ties of friend
ship and common interest, there is
no reason why the Honor System
should not be practiced and fostered
by the whole student body.
It is not a matter of developing a
spirit of honor and fair play in the
individual, it happens that most of
us have it. Furthermore it is not a
case of maintaining such a system
through fear of punishment, if so the
question of honor is no longer involv
ed. The system can and should be
carried on through the force of spon
taneous and unanimous sentiment.
Granting that the spirit of fair play
is weaker in some of us than in
others, no man is going to cheat in
the face of the sentimentt which he
knows exists and especially with the
spiritual prod of a placard, staring
him in the face reminding him that he
is trusted. No freshman after the
proper explanation at a general as
sembly and the further lesson of pre
cept and example, is going to be ob
livious to the spirit that prevails in
the class room, and will mould his
conduct and beliefs accordingly.
This may sound rather idealistic
or smack of premature heavenly at
tainment or more particularly endow
the Stanfordite with angelic prin
ciples. If such is the case it is in
teresting to note that our saints are
peculiarly assembled according to de
partments. Students have unofficially
been placed on their honor in some of
the departments for a number of
years. You need only to talk to the
men and the professors of these de
partments to find that it is an un
qualified success. In the Geology and
Mining Department, it is directly in
the hands of the Geology and Mining
Society. Any cases that may arise
are handled by this organization of
students. This is as it should be.
Similar arrangements can be made in
every department by the students
themselves. The Honor System
should not be crammed down any
one's throat but because of the
"scrupleless few" it does require the
sponsorship of the sentiment and ini
tiative of the departmental student
organizations, and it behooves these
bodies to act accordingly so that we
may claim along with our other at
tainments a 100 per cent Honor Sys
tem at Stanford. 11. A. BROWNE, '10
