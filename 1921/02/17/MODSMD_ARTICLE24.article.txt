At the meeting of the Euphronia De

held for places on the debating team
which will meet the Nestoria Debating

tryouts were closely contested, and a
great deal of excellent debating ability
shown. The men who will represent
Euphronia in this debate are E. D. Lan
dels, '21, Ellis Hirschfeld, '21, and E. C.
Durand, '24. S. C. Anderson, '22, was
chosen as an alternate. The debate will
be held the latter part of this quarter.
The question for final discussion is:
"Resolved, That the death penalty be
abolished in the State of California."
