# CARDINALS OVERWHELM COUGARS IN SECOND GAME OF NORTHERN SERIES BY 36-20 SCORE; LEAVE FOR SEATTLE
## Righter and Davies Are Largely Responsible for Victory with Eighteen Points Apiece 
### 
"Swede" Righter and Jimmy Davies were the outstanding reasons for the
defeat of the Washington State Cougars in the second game of the series
at Pullman last night. The score was 36 to 20 and Righter and Davies
monopolized all of the goal shooting honors copping off eighteen points each.
Righter was the sensation of the contest. He made four field goals in
the opening period and five more in the second spasm. Davies scored five
from the floor and contributed eight free ones out of twelve tries. While
Righter and Davies were administering the bitter medicine, Captain Freddy
Adams kept the Stanford territory fairly free of Cougars, and press dispatch
es indicate that the little captain went some on his own account.

The Cougars fought through to tho
finish but they were no match for
Coach Powell's cohorts who kept the
game sewed up from the start. The
score at half time was twelve to nine
in favor of the Cardinal. In the sec
ond half the Cougars added eleven
points to their score while Stanford
piled on twenty-four more, making the
final score 36 to 20.
Evidently the Stanford quintet is
back in its old form and prospects
are much brighter for the real cru
cial series of the northern tour which
begins tomorrow night in Seattle. The
University of Washington five which
furnishes the competition in the next
two games has been resting this week,
but since Powell's men are again in
their stride it is impossible to pick the
winner. The games will certainly be
whirlwind affairs.
Captain Mclvor was the largest in
dividual point winner for the Wash
ington State five. He scored ten po
ints out of seventeen free throws at
the basket. Mclvor is a guard but
he is blessed with a knack of con
verting gift shots He made seven
teen out of twenty-six in the first
battle and ten out of seventeen in last
night's affray.
California was also successful in its
contest with the Oregon Aggies last
night so that the teams are still tied
for leading honors. The Bruins leave
for Eugene, Oregon today to play the
University of Oregon two games. If
both California teams are successful
in their last two games in the north
they will decide the Pacific Coast
Conference championship in Califor
nia the latter part of this month.

score at half time was twelve to nine
in favor of the Cardinal. In the sec
ond half the Cougars added eleven
points to their score while Stanford
piled on twenty-four more, making the
final score 36 to 20.
Evidently the Stanford quintet is
back in its old form and prospects
are much brighter for the real cru
cial series of the northern tour which
begins tomorrow night in Seattle. The
University of Washington five which
furnishes the competition in the next
two games has been resting this week,
but since Powell's men are again in
their stride it is impossible to pick the
winner. The games will certainly be
whirlwind affairs.
Captain Mclvor was the largest in
dividual point winner for the Wash
ington State five. He scored ten po
ints out of seventeen free throws at
the basket. Mclvor is a guard but
he is blessed with a knack of con
verting gift shots He made seven
teen out of twenty-six in the first
battle and ten out of seventeen in last
night's affray.
California was also successful in its
contest with the Oregon Aggies last
night so that the teams are still tied
for leading honors. The Bruins leave
for Eugene, Oregon today to play the
University of Oregon two games. If
both California teams are successful
in their last two games in the north
they will decide the Pacific Coast
Conference championship in Califor
nia the latter part of this month.

"Swede" Righter and Jimmy Davies were the outstanding reasons for the
defeat of the Washington State Cougars in the second game of the series
at Pullman last night. The score was 36 to 20 and Righter and Davies
monopolized all of the goal shooting honors copping off eighteen points each.
Righter was the sensation of the contest. He made four field goals in
the opening period and five more in the second spasm. Davies scored five
from the floor and contributed eight free ones out of twelve tries. While
Righter and Davies were administering the bitter medicine, Captain Freddy
Adams kept the Stanford territory fairly free of Cougars, and press dispatch
es indicate that the little captain went some on his own account.

The Cougars fought through to tho
finish but they were no match for
Coach Powell's cohorts who kept the
game sewed up from the start. The
score at half time was twelve to nine
in favor of the Cardinal. In the sec
ond half the Cougars added eleven
points to their score while Stanford
piled on twenty-four more, making the
final score 36 to 20.
