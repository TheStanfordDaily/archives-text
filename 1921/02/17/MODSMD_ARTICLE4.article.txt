# CARDINAL FRESHMEN LOSE SECOND COURT GAME TO BERKELEY
## Blue and Gold Babes Defeat Local First-Year Squad by 42-17 at Harmon Gym 
### 
California' Freshmen 42, Stanford
Freshmen 17. That is the story of the
second game, last night, between the
rival Babe quintets of the two univer
sities. The game was not as good a
basketball contest as the fir>t of the
series that was played here last Satur
day. Both teams last night fought too
hard to make the game a really good
exhibition, and the large number of per
sonal fouls on either side made the con
test slow.
The local freshmen fought as. they
ha ! never fought before to stem the
rush of the Bruins, but were unable to
come closer than within four points of
the Blue and Gold lead. Over-anxiety
on the side of the locals to stop the
Californians lost them many chances to
score, and the basket work of the Babes
was poor on the long shots. These were
the only kind they had, so the results
were not satisfactory in point numbers.
California opened the struggle with a
field goal made by Captain Talt on a
long shot from the middle of the field
in the first minute of play. Pierce fol
lowed with another of a like variety
and the Bruins jumped into the lead
that they constantly increased through
the whole game.
McHose scored early in the play and
was followed with another by Granger.
The tallies mounted slowly with the
locals about five or six points behind
until the half ended California 17, Stan
ford 12. At the half time the Babes
figured they were due for a come-back
and came onto the court at the opening
gun resolved to even the score. The
Cubs fooled them again, though, and
began the same fast game that they
showed in the second half of the game
here.
Early in this period Pierce went out
on four personals and Wetzel substi
tuted. Kincaid followed Pierce to the
bench on the same count and Houvinen
went in for him. Werlee and Smith
substituted for Ure and Wetzel.
Reeder was the first of the Stanford
subs to go in. He entered to give Jan
sen a breathing spell. Jansen replaced
him but was taken out with four per
sonals, and Reeder went in again. Other
substitutions were: Lowenstein for
Granger, Bragg for McHose, Atwill for
Campbell, Cooper for Smith, and Ala
baster for Lowenstein. Only the first
man, Reeder, completed his two neces
sary entrances into the game to be sure
of a numeral in addition to the five that
started both games.
The lineups were:
Stanford—McHose, Granger, Jansen,
Campbell, Smith.
California—Talt, captain; Pierce,
Wright, Kincaid, and Ure.
Referee—Street.
