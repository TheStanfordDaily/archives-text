# LOCAL LIGHTWEIGHTS DEFEAT CALIFORNIA IN EASY GAME; 30-20
## 
### 
Stanford's 135-pound basketball
team turned the tables of the fresh
man game last night, at California,
and walloped the Bruin light weights
30 to 20. The limited hung the
crepe on the Blue and Gold aggrega
tion at every part of the contest and
never gave them a look in.
The game opened with W. W. Young
and Hogle of the locals rining up a
half a dozen baskets before the Cali
fornians got started. The northern
ers had never worked much together
from the looks of their performance
in the first period and the mosquitoes
from the farm mixed them up until
they couldn't get anywhere. When
the whistle blew to end the first round
the locals were on the long end of
20 to 6.
With the start of' the second half
the Caltfornians staged a desperate
attempt to rally and did catch up ten
points befoie the Stanford five pinned
them down again. Then the light
weights had everything their own way
and the score went up to the final
tally, Stanford 30, California 20. The
line-up for the locals was: Hollings
worth and Koba, forwards; Hogle,
center; W. W. Young and Silveira,
guards. Subs: Brazil, Polesky and
Kennedy. Referee, Street.
