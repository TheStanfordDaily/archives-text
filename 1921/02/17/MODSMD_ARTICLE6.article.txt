# 'POWDER RIVER' FILM TO BE SHOWN FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN
## 
### 
In order that school children may
have an opportunity to see the "Powder
River" film, the official moving picture
of American operations in France, a
special matinee has been arranged for
them on Saturday afternoon in the As
sembly Hall.
This matinee is set for 2 o'clock and
the price for children will be 25 cents.
For adults the admission charge at the
matinee will be the same as for the two
evening exhibitions, 50 cents, which in
cludes the war tax.
The promoters of the presentation of
the film believe that the pictures have
so much educational value for school
children who are now studying the
World War that a special opportunity
has been offered them to see it.
The forty-piece military band from
Fort Scott, which has been ordered to
Palo Alto by General Hunter Liggett
in connection with the Powder River
film, will be here both Friday and Sat
urday.
An indication of the drawing power
of the Powder River film as seen from
the professional exhibitor's point of
view is the fact that the California The
ater in San Francisco, which has audi
ences of thousands every day, has ar
ranged to run the film for a solid week.
Since it takes more than two hours to
run off the three reels, the manager of
this theater evidently believes that he
can fill his house for a week with prac
tically nothing else than this single fea
ture, In several cities in the northwest
and in northern California where the
film has been shown the theaters have
run it for a solid week to packed houses
at every performance.
Fremont Post of the American Legion
and the local post of the Disabled Vet
erans of the World War, which are
united in tjic showing of this film, are
placing it before tlie public on its own
value and making no appeal on the
grounds of the purpose to which they
intend to devote the proceeds, which is
the care and rehabilitation of men who
have been incapacitated by the war.
This purpose, however, is one that has
received high commendation from such
men as General Pershing and General
Wood. General Pershing, writing re
cently, said:
"I am, of course, very much inter
ested in everything which concerns the
welfare or betterment of ex-service
men and am in thorough sympathy with
all legitimate efforts to aid them to re
habilitate themselves. This particularly
applies to those who by reason of
wounds or sickness have been totally or
partially disabled. Such aid should not
be classed as charity, but held as a sacred
duty."
General Wood wrote.
"I am very glad you are going to
make this effort and wish for you the
largest possible measure of success. We
owe a debt of gratitude to the men who
carried our flag to victory, who offered
everything, even life itself. Especially
are we indebted to those who have come
back crippled and unable to take up
again their former occupations.
"We must do everything possible to
make these men again active, useful
members of society

In order that school children may
have an opportunity to see the "Powder
River" film, the official moving picture
of American operations in France, a
special matinee has been arranged for
them on Saturday afternoon in the As
sembly Hall.
This matinee is set for 2 o'clock and
the price for children will be 25 cents.
For adults the admission charge at the
matinee will be the same as for the two
evening exhibitions, 50 cents, which in
cludes the war tax.
The promoters of the presentation of
the film believe that the pictures have
so much educational value for school
children who are now studying the
World War that a special opportunity
has been offered them to see it.
The forty-piece military band from
Fort Scott, which has been ordered to
Palo Alto by General Hunter Liggett
in connection with the Powder River
film, will be here both Friday and Sat
urday.
An indication of the drawing power
of the Powder River film as seen from
the professional exhibitor's point of
view is the fact that the California The
ater in San Francisco, which has audi
ences of thousands every day, has ar
ranged to run the film for a solid week.
Since it takes more than two hours to
run off the three reels, the manager of
this theater evidently believes that he
can fill his house for a week with prac
tically nothing else than this single fea
ture, In several cities in the northwest
and in northern California where the
film has been shown the theaters have
run it for a solid week to packed houses
at every performance.
Fremont Post of the American Legion
and the local post of the Disabled Vet
erans of the World War, which are
united in tjic showing of this film, are
placing it before tlie public on its own
value and making no appeal on the
grounds of the purpose to which they
intend to devote the proceeds, which is
the care and rehabilitation of men who
have been incapacitated by the war.
This purpose, however, is one that has
received high commendation from such
men as General Pershing and General
Wood. General Pershing, writing re
cently, said:
"I am, of course, very much inter
ested in everything which concerns the
welfare or betterment of ex-service
men and am in thorough sympathy with
all legitimate efforts to aid them to re
habilitate themselves. This particularly
applies to those who by reason of
wounds or sickness have been totally or
partially disabled. Such aid should not
be classed as charity, but held as a sacred
duty."
