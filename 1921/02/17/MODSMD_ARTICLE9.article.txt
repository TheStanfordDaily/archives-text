# De VRIES RECOMMENDED FOR POSTMASTERSHIP
## 
### 
Friends of Martin DeVries, '21, on
the Campus and in Palo Alto, are giv
ing him their support for the Stan
ford postmastership by the circula
tion of a petition endorsing him for
the position. During the war DeVries
served with the American Red Cross,
first in connection with the hospital
service, and later with the Bureau of
Supplies. His services were so high
ly recognized that, he was tendered a
commission which would place him as
departmental head for assisting dis
abled veterans in one of the largest
hospitals in the United States. He
was unable to accept this offer because
of college plans.
DeVries is registered in the Political
Science department and has been
active in tlebating. He has worked
his way through Stanford despite the
fact of his loss of two limbs, and is
at present, associated with a law office
in Palo Alto.
