This Prize? |j
The Samuels Jewelry Co. of San Francisco offers $25 for
the best, and $15 and $10 for the second and third answers
I to the question "when May Students Buy Jewelry?" ||
By /. F. Haight, Adv. Mgr.
What is the limit set by good taste on the articcs of jewelry that
may be purchased by a student? This is the question we want
answered in 200-word essays by Stanford Students. Under
graduates are not presumed to be good customers oi the Jeweler
but in these days of great prosperity it may be that many have
sufficient funds supplied by their own efforts or by wealthy
parents to permit them an occasional purchase of a birthday or
. other gift, or an engagement ring.
It costs nothing to compete. Write for a sheet giving instruc
tions for contestants and go to it. Awards will be made by a
committee of the faculty, Professors Everett Smith, Miller Mc-
Clintock, and Paul Clyde. The contest is open to all classes.
The winning essays will be published in the Daily Palo Alto and
the information will be used by this firm only as a guide in ad- #
vertising our business to College people.
