# STANFORD WILL PLAY WASHINGTON QUINTET TONIGHT
## Cardinals Are Expected to Repeat Former Victories Against Sun Dodgers' Team 
### 
The varsity meets the University of
Washington quintet in the first game
of the second series tonight in Se
attle. This is the extra series that
the Cardinal five has to play in ac
cordance with theÂ» schedule of the Pa
cific Coast Conference. The team has
rested only one day and will have a
battle royal with the aggregation from
the Seattle university.
In the games here, the varsity only
won from the northerners by the hard
est playing in the two-night series and
only sewed the games up 4n the last
few minutes each time. The purple
and gold organization has had a week's
rest while the Stanford team has
'played two games already this week
with the strong Washington State
live. They [left Pullman yesterday
afternoon and have spent today in
Seattle working out on the court
there.
Crawford, the Washington guard,
played a whirlwind of a game here
when the quintet was south, and kept
Righter on the jump all through the
contests. Sielk the lanky center of
the Sun Dodgers will start again,
probably against Mills, who has been
kept out of the last games in the
north. The rest of the same original
Washington line-up will go against
the Cardinals. The local lineup is not
definite. It will probably be Righter
and Davies, forwards; Miller or Car
ver, center; and Adams and Rich
mond, guards.
The Stanford team will go against
the Sundodgers tomorrow night in the
last j dine of the northern series. They
will leave Seattle directly after the
game and arrive here Monday if they
travel according to schedule.
