# OR. JORDAN EXPLAINS BENEFITS OF BIOLOGY TO HUMAN PROGRESS
## 
### 
"Tlie benefit to the world of biology
and its kindred sciences is, first, through
economic advancement, second, through
the development of modern sanitation,
and third, the emancipation of the human
j mind from its superstitions in regard to
LI the structure of tiie body." This was
! the substance of Dr. Jordan's talk be
fore the World Problems Forum on
! "The Contributions of Biology to
| Human Welafre," given in the Little
11 Theater last night. "Every form of
science gains added dignity by beinfe
' made of use to man,'' said the Chan
! cellor, "and the study of living organ
isms has resulted in inestimable prac
tical benefits."
Dr. Jordan gave several examples of
1 the economic benefits of biology. "Plant
1 and animal breeding has now reached
' the stage of a fine art," he said. "It is
possible to produce the very highest type
(fcf animal or plant through careful se
' lection. Right on this farm Governor
Stanford produced some of the finest
horses in the world." Ihe conservation
' of forests and fisheries is primarily a
problem of biology." he continued, "and
is one of vast importance at present.
William v/Greeley, a former Stanford
j student, is at present in charge of this
work as Chief Forester of the United

•, Dr. Jordan explained that the reason
. that tuberculosis and cancer are so dan
i gerous is because no effective means
3 lias been discovered to check the growth
a or spread of the bacteria, and at present
all that can be done is to make the body
i. more resistant to the attacks (if the

"There has never been a conflict be
i tween religion and science, declared the
Chancellor. "The only conflict has been
between knowledge and liearsy, between
fact and superstition. Ihe education o,
the people in the principles of >anita
li lion and health has largely eliminated
thf old hokus-pokus methods of treating
disorders and diseases."
II In conclusion. Dr. Jordan touched on
8 the relation of biology to politics,
i, "There is only one thing that deter
tl mines the downfall of a nation, and that
II j is the destruction of the best stock, com
: bined with the increased breeding of the
a inferior elements. When people are op-
El pressed, down-trodden, and subject to
; ; famines, they have only the oselvcs to

--1 of initiative that they have reached such

"Tlie benefit to the world of biology
and its kindred sciences is, first, through
economic advancement, second, through
the development of modern sanitation,
and third, the emancipation of the human
j mind from its superstitions in regard to
LI the structure of tiie body." This was
! the substance of Dr. Jordan's talk be
fore the World Problems Forum on
! "The Contributions of Biology to
| Human Welafre," given in the Little
11 Theater last night. "Every form of
science gains added dignity by beinfe
' made of use to man,'' said the Chan
! cellor, "and the study of living organ
isms has resulted in inestimable prac
tical benefits."
Dr. Jordan gave several examples of
1 the economic benefits of biology. "Plant
1 and animal breeding has now reached
' the stage of a fine art," he said. "It is
possible to produce the very highest type
(fcf animal or plant through careful se
' lection. Right on this farm Governor
Stanford produced some of the finest
horses in the world." Ihe conservation
' of forests and fisheries is primarily a
problem of biology." he continued, "and
is one of vast importance at present.

"There has never been a conflict be
i tween religion and science, declared the
Chancellor. "The only conflict has been
between knowledge and liearsy, between
fact and superstition. Ihe education o,
the people in the principles of >anita

thf old hokus-pokus methods of treating
disorders and diseases."
II In conclusion. Dr. Jordan touched on
8 the relation of biology to politics,
i, "There is only one thing that deter
tl mines the downfall of a nation, and that
II j is the destruction of the best stock, com
: bined with the increased breeding of the
a inferior elements. When people are op-
El pressed, down-trodden, and subject to
; ; famines, they have only the oselvcs to
; j blame, as it is due to their own lack
--1 of initiative that they have reached such
r a state. The white raci is dominant be
