# "POWDER RIVER" IS SEAL ACTION FILM
## 
### 
General John J. Pershing is the first
figure who appears in the 7,000-foot
lilm, "Powder River," which will be
shown in the Assembly Hall at 7:30 to
night and again tomorrow afternoon and
evening. The first picture presents him
leaving New York with his staff for
France, then he is shown landing on
French soil and greeted by the Euro
pean officers, who hail his arrival as a
promise of hope for victory.
The film then shows in episodes, which
run for more than two hours, the whole
progress of America's participation hi
the war from the time when we began
to send over troops until the armistice.
Some of the pictures seem on their
face almost impossible. The great Ger
man submarine killer, U-3S, is shown
actually sinking fourteen vessels on the
Atlantic. These pictures were) taken, as
were many others, from aeroplanes.
Another picture which ;would seem an
impossibility, except that this entire film
was taken by the United States Army
Signal Corps, and is released by the
army authorities themselves, is a scene
in which an American aviator is shot
down inside the German lines and taken
prisoner, but manages before his capture
to set his plane on fire and destroy it.
American convoys are shown sailing
across the Atlantic bearing thousands of
soldiers, and these soldiers are shown in
thei revery-day life of camp and on the
march up. to the very front line trenches
and pitched battles, with the Red Cross
first aid statuns hard at work behind
the lines.
Stewart Edward White will be unable,,
because of other engagements, to speak
during the presentation of the film, as
lias been announced, but the Rev. R. B.
Cherrington, of Palo Alto, who was a
chaplain in the 91st Division and is now
chaplain of Fremont Post of the Amer
ican Legion, will comment on the pic
tures in which he, himself, appear a
number of times.
The forty-piece military band from
Fort Scott will be in Palo Alto and on
