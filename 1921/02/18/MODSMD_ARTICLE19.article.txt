# POINT WINNERS
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton's track team will win from California, if
Stanford men in numbers get out on the oval and learn to take second
and third places. The Cardinal now has more individual stars than has
Berkeley. We had them last year and took more first places in the
Conference meet than did any university, but we did not win.
Templeton can teach men how to take points, if they are willing to
work, but he needs men who will work faithfully when he is able to
give them personal attention, and more faithfully when he cannot do so.
Development in a majority of the events is attained through study and
consistent daily workouts. It is well known that more stars are de
veloped than are born.
The coach tells of a man who came out last year for the first time,
with whom he worked for about a month in a particular event, and who
was soon regarded by "Dad" Moulton as the best possibility in years.
At the end of a month he disappeared. Stanford needs fewer ballroom
and more track athletes. This is not to say that we lack the red-blooded
men we formerly had. There arc a number of excellent prospects out on
the track every night, but there are a great many more who have never
been in track suits, and with them the outcome of the California meet
may rest.
