The plans for the Masonic dance to
be given at the Women's Clubhouse
next Monday night are rapidly assum
ing definite form.
The, committee in charge is arrang
ing a series of entertainment to take
place between dances. The very best
campus talent has been procured for
this purpose, among the number being
Les Scib, Jack Heffernan, and Nathan
son on the saxaphone. Other campus
artists will contribute to the intermis
sion between the dance numbers.
The Masonic Club wishes to empha

and their wives are cordially invited to
attend the dance. Unescorted women
are also given a hearty invitation. The
dance will have all the best features
of a jolly-up without the objectional
parts.
