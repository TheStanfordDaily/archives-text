# Ernest Gale Martin Heads Department of Physiology
## 
### 
Eastern universities are in the habit
of assuming that the colleges of the
West form a recruiting ground from
which they may draw on need for pro
fessors for their faculties; Stanford
showed its peculiar drawing power when
in 1916 Ernest Gale Martin accepted its
call to become head of the Physiology
department and deserted the halls of
Harvard.
A varied career as a student, teacher,
and author preceded Professor Mar
tin's appointment. Following his grad
uation from Hamlin College, Minne
sota, in 1897, he taught in high schools
for four years and entered Johns Hop
kins Junior University as a graduate
student in 1901. Three years of study
in the Maryland university were recog
nized by a degree of Doctor of Philos
ophy.
A short period of teaching at Purdue
University preceded his work at Harv
ard, which he began in 1906. For a
decade Professor Martin taught at
Harvard, rising from the position of in
structor to that of assistant professor.
Radcliffe and the Sargent School for
Physical Training utilized his services
as a teacher when the duties of his pro
fessorial chair freed him for outside
work, if â€¢
The books by Dr. Martin are recog
nized as authoritative by members of the
medical and teaching professions. Twice
he has published revisions of Martin's
"Human Body," a text used by many
medical colleges. Research work in the
physiological effects of induced currents
in the blood led him to write "Measure
ment of Induction Shocks," which con
tains the results of his study. Next
spring the Collier's Publishing Company
will publish a book he has recently com
pleted, "Physiology and Hygiene," one

of a series of popular and scientific texts.
In common with many of the Stan
ford faculty, Professor Martin left liis
academic duties during the war to serve
the government. First joining the Public
Health Service, his duties required him
to inspect the munition workers of many
states and judge as to their physical
efficiency. Later, he was appointed a
captain in the Sanitary Corps, becoming
divisional nutrition officer of General
Leonard Wood's division. Discharged
from the army in January, 1919, he is
now a member of the Public Health
Service on inactive duty.
To his friends Professor Martin is a
man whose human interest takes him
into many activities outside his duties
as a professor. Nearly every afternoon,
if the weather permits, he is found on
the tennis court of the Faculty Club,
where he is known as one of the "Old
Guard" of the racqueters. In summer
he never fails to answer the call of
Pacific Grove, where he and his family
live until the opening of Stanford in
October.
Sherlock Holmes, he frankly admits,
is one of his .favorite authors, as detec
tive stories are his chosen means of
relaxation. Dr. Martin prefers the short
stories of O. Henry, Kipling, and Rich
ard Harding Davis to the lengthy novels
of contemporary fictionists. The At
lantic Monthly, the Literary Digest, and
the Saturday Evening Post are always
found on his library table.
The movies cannot claim him as a fan.
for he terms the usual film as stupid.
"The Mark of Zorro," Professor Martin
believes was an exception which he
thoroughly enjoyed. .
Professor Martin is a Fellow in the
American Association for the Advance
ment of Sciences and in the American
Acadamv of Arts and Sciences.
