That P. O. sign advertising for a
"baby walker" is Greek to the non
domesticated and uninformed and
even to others. Even a prof, was
wondering the other day whether a
servant was wanted to teach the in
fant to walk, or whether an infant by
the name of Walker was in demand.
Although ye ed. is not in a position to
be an authority on such matters, he
willingly volunteers the information
that he was the proud owner of one
once. Note: Owner of a walker.

The river came op and flooded 1 the
advertiser's back yard.. He couldn't
get down to his place of business. And
then the meaning of the words, "Have
you a little ferry in your home," ap
pealed to him with mare th.m usaal
emphasis.

The hunter stood firiurg shot after
shot into the foliage of a tall tree. A.
coon chanced by and paused to in
quire, "What you-all shootln' at. Big
boy?"
"A bear," briefly replied the hunter
"Ain't nuffin in dat tree," vouch
safed the darkskin.
After firing a dozen more rounds at
the mystic bear, the hunter discovered.!
that he had a flea on his eyelash.

That old custom of widow SJurning
in India l was all wrong. They should
have burned the wife first and let the

The' spectators weren't the- only
ones who took in everything at the i
bouts Tast night. Several of the tfsti
cuff artists seemed disinclined to let
anything get past 'em.

Powder River'* had an advance pub
licity agent at the affair, too. His
wortfry "Waihoo" in of
the pugs' efforts will no doubt attract
a 1 la*rge crowd to the army film. These
advertising people certainly have the
hop on originality.

We're curious to know what the
new army ration is. We dont care
wfiat they call it, but we sure want a
bottle of it.

Some of the boys were so anxious
last night that they started: a duel be
fore the gong blew. Of course, it
takes all kinds of folks to make up a
population, but there are those who
would have been willing to wai ta
while. The undertaker is a nice man
but we don't crave his acquaintance.

And the boys all went home sing
ing, "Just like a Cripple."

If the referee lost his goat, where
would he get a Noonan?

Wonder how many will say, ."This
youth thinks he's Funny."
