# LEAGUE TROPHY AND MEDALS TO BE GIVEN SOCCER SQUAD SOON
## Cup Awarded by Italian Club Will Be Presented in City at Banquet After Easter 
### 
Stanford's championship soccer team
will lie formally awarded the league cup
and the individual medals will be dis
tributed to the players at a banquet to
be held in San Francisco after the
Easter holidays, according to an an
nouncement issued after the meeting of
the Socccr League in San Francisco yes
terday. The banquet will probably come
the first Monday, of the spring quarter.
The cup was put up by the Italian
Club to go to the winner of the league
championship, and will thus be in Stan
ford's permanent possession. It is a
magnificent trophy, and there was some
talk of making it only a temporary pos
session of the winner, but in accordance
with the wishes of faie donors it be
comes the property of the Cardinal per
petually. Next year a cup will probably
be put up which will have to be won
more than once to be kept permanently.
The medals for individual players will
not be ready until after Easter, as they
will be cast from the same dies as the
medals to be given to the champion
players of the Senior League of San
Francisco. There will be twelve medals
to be distributed. As more than twelve
men have taken part in league games
for the Cardinal, a selection will have
to be made on the basis of the number of
league games in which the players have
participated. Coach Maloney is not yet
ready to announce the list of twelve who
will win the trophies. The medals are
to be donated by the California Soccer
Association, and will be presented at the
same banque\ with the cup.
The cup will be on exhibition in San
Francisco next Sunday, the occasion be
ing the play-off game for the champion
ship game of the Sunday League.
While the varsity squad is at present
inactive, the Palo Alto Legion team,
composed mostly of former Stanford
men and undergraduates, has three
games lined up. The first will be this
Saturday with the Chinese Y. M. C. A.
at the Stadium in San Francisco. The
next two games, on the following Satur
days, are with the Italian Club and the
Olympic Club, both games to be played
at Eighth and Market.
There are three former Stanford
soccer captains on the Legion team â€”
Lieut. Boyle, Reynolds, and Quinby.
Other Stanford men who will play
are Clark, Price,\ Jim Adams, McGil
vray, Couch, Dr. Browne, and Coach
Maloney. Masters and Peavy. both on
the present barsity, are also on the
Legion squad.
Future games for the varsity are still
uncertain. Maloney has not yet heard
from Sacramento, and if that plan
proves impossible, a game with the Grass
Valley League stars may be arranged.
In either case the opposition will be
strong enough to make it interesting.
The freshman team matches wits and
feet with the Seale Academy boys this
afternoon. No material changes have
been made in the '24 lineup, and if work
ing together counts for anything, a good
showing is due from Captain Todd and
his men. Weather conditions lately have
greatly hindered practice
