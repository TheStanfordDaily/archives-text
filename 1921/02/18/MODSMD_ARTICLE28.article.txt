# Freshman Soccer Team Ties Seale Academy
## 
### 
The freshman soccer team met the
Seale Academy eleven yesterday af
ternoon and yiame out with a tie
score, the final count being 1 to 1.
The game itself was rather slow. This
can be attributed to the fact that the
field was not in the best of shape
due to the recent rainy weather.
The next game on the freshman
schedule is a return contest with the
same team. It will take place next
Wednesday afternoon, weather con
ditions permitting.
Capt. Todd's team did not show the
necessary additional improvement
which was hoped for in order to win
the game. Consistent practice with
the aid of good weather, however,
should go far toward making for a
decisive victory the next time the
teams clash.
