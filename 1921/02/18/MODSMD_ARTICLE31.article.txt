### 
A copy of the first complete edition
of the text of tlie Heraclean Tablets, 1
which is one of the rare volumes ac
quired by Librarian Clark on his recent |
trip to Europe, has just been received
by the Library.- The Tablet itself with I
its Latin inscription was set up in i
Heraclea in the south of Italy after 46
I! C., and is now recognized as con- j
taining a long fragment of the other- |
wise unknown Municipal Law of Julius j
Caesar. The bronze plate on which it is \
engraved is one of the treasures of the 1
Royal Museum at Naples. The only
other copy of the text of the Tablets in
this country is in the Harvard Library.
