## BILL BURKHART GETS DECISION OVER JOHNNY LANE IN THE 'WELTERS'; JIMMIE ROSS GIVES SPIERS THE NEAR K. 0. 
### 
When liill Burkhart and Johnny Lane,
two welterweights, loft the ring in the
I campus championship boxing tourna
ment held at Encina Gymnasium last
night, local fans had seen the best bout
of the evening and one of the best ever
staged at Stanford.
Both men were clever and gritty,
j They used their heads as well as their
; mitts. The whole bout was a fast give
l and-take battle with little clinching.
' Burkhart held a -light edge throughout
| the contest and his wicked left brought
! roars from the fans. Lane went down
I under a heavy wallop in the third, but
was up again, and they exchanged heavy
punches until the gong sounded. It was
Burkhart's bout.
Jimmy Ross maintained his hard
hitting reputation when he stopped Bo 1
_ I

Spiers in the third round. Spiers was
up before the count, but, judging .by his
actions, he was taking a short coursc in
astronomy, so Noonan stopped the
match. This bout showed real boxing
skill and headwork. Both -men led hard
in the. first round, which ended with
little advantage either way. In the sec
ond Spiers came back strong and took
the lead. This round was a combination
uf heavy wallops and clinching. Ross
went into the third round with his fight
ing spirit registering strong, and, after
an even exchange of punches, Ross de
livered three to the head in quick suc
cession and Spiers went down. The
bout was over.
From the time that "Bud" Woodward
and Hugh Fnllerton, welterweights,
squared off at the tap of the gong it was
a battle and no quarter asked. Wood
ward has a terrific punch and he landed
some heavy crosses to the body which
thudded like the fall oi* a piledriver.
Fnllerton made a game stand and came
through several times with well-placed
punches, but in the third round Wood
ward, using the ropes to good advantage,
led out with a battering attack which
easily gave him the decision.
The bout between Howard Brown and
"Mike" Hodges, featherweights, was a
battle royal from the first gong to the
last. The first round was about even
with both men getting in good punches.
Brown was the more aggressive, but
Hodges had cleverness and showed more
ring generalship. The second round was
an exchange of wallops, featuring good
footwork. In the third Brown worked
a close-up rush game which carried In â– 
opponent backward across the ring.
Hodges' cleverness stood him in good
stead and he received little real punish
ment. The decision went to Brown.
The bantams. Sam Simmons and
Kaluin Sapero. came through in good
fashion with their bout and gave the
