# CHINESE THEATER TO FORM STAGE SETTING FOR CELESTIAL PLAY
## 
### 
Reproduced in all its quaintne-s and
! beauty, a Chinese theater forms the
j stage setting of the "Yellow Jacket,"
the English Club play which will be pre
sented in the Assembly Hall on March
Bth. The whole "works"' are right there
in plain view, including the property
man, the manager, the orchestra and all
the paraphenalia.
The play proceeds strictly according
1 to Chinese conventions, which from the ,
American viewpoint are the most un
conventional things imaginable. As each
character appears on the scene he shows
his good intentions by promptly giving
a complete sketch of his past life and
present plans. We hate to think what
might happen if this practice were car-
I ried out in real life, but as shown on
I the stage it forms one of the most pic
turesque features of a drama that is
everywhere distinctly "different."
For fear that you won't lie able to
follow the play, the obliging celestial
provides a Chorus who at all times
keeps you posted on what is taking place.
The droll comments of this character
are really rich. ,
One quickly becomes accustomed to
the strangeness of it all, and then the
true beauty of the central story becomes
apparent. It depicts the struggles of the
wistful young hero for his beautiful
little Plum Blossom, and shows that,
regardless of race, wherever there is
youth there is romance.
As a play the "Yellow Jacket" has
charmed people in every part of the
world, and the Stanford campus will
be no exception.
