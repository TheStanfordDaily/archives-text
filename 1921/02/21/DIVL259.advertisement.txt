A Man's Shoe

Here is a sturdy dark brown calf shoe that
answers the need for campus wear.
Stout soles and heels, brass
eyelets and staunchly made.
This shoe is not too fine for everyday college wear.
It is neat and good looking, but still sturdily made.
If you should care to wear it for semi-dress occa
sions, it would be entirely appropriate.
These shoes are showing a very great decrease,
due to price revisions
