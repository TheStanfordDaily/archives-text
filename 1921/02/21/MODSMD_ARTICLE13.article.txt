# VARSITY IS NOSED OUT OF BOTH OF WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY GAMES AND LOSES CHANCE FOR P. C. C. PENNANT
## Brilliant Playing and Fight Mark Contests; Stanford Leads at Half In Second; Finals 28-25; 17-16 
### 
Washington wreaked its vengeance
upon Stanford for the two defeats suf
fered on Encina court two weeks ago,
hy winning both games from the Car
dinal quintet on the Seattle court on
Friday and Saturday nights. Like the
two contests between the Purple and
Gold aggregation and the Powellites
here, the games in the northland were
close and hotly contested. The score on
Friday night was 25 to 28, and on Satur
day Stanford made its linal attempt to
stay in the conference championship run
ning, but when down to defeat in the
last few minutes of play, the score be
ing 17 to 16.
Had Stanford been able to down
Washington in the final game it would

.still have a chance to tie with California
for the conference title, but Saturday's
loss gives the gonfalon to the Berkeley
team.
The Cardinal quintet left Stanford a
week ago last Friday leading the confer
ence with an unblemished record. It met
its first defeat at Berkeley, losing to
thee Bruins in a heart-breaking game.
Following this contest the two teams,
Stanford and California, departed for
the northland to meet the northern uni
versity fives. California was success
ful in all four of its games, while Stan
ford broke even, winning the first two
and losing the last pair. As it now
stands, Stanford has suffered three de
feats and is in second placÂ«, while the
California five has lost but one game,
and wins the conference championship.
The first game at Seattle Friday found
Coach Powell's cohorts a little weary
from their two victories over the fast
Washington State team. Washington
led in the first half, scoring 15 points to
8 for the Cardinal. The old Stanford
fight was on display in the second period
and the Powellites leaped into the lead
and maintained a one-point advantage
up tn the last three minutes of play,
when two spectacular shots by the
Washington forwards won the game for
the Purple and Gold tosscrs.
In the second fracas on Saturday the
Cardinal quintet started out to trim their
hosts and they scared them considerably.
The score at half time was 12 to 11 in
favor of Stanford. Both teams came
back with the old do-or-die spirit and*
the last period resolved itself into a real'
battle. The five-man defense system of
Washington was working to perfection,
while the Cardinal defensive methods
were just as effective. It was neck-and
ncck until near the end of the game,
when a long shot by Captain Talbot of
the Washington five threw the northern
team into the lead.
Just how effective the defenses of the
two outfits were is shown by the score
for the second part of the game. Wash
ington scored but six points, and they
held Stanford to four markers.
Stanford will play its last conference'
game with the University of California
quintet on Encina court next Saturday
night. This is likewise the second game
of the Stanford-California series.
