## 
### 
In an effort to obtain "better films"
for the state, Prof. H. D. Gray of the
English department has drawn up a
bill which will soon be brought before
the State Legislature, providing for
the creation of a State Board of Re
view for Motion Pictures. The bill
calls for a board consisting of the
State superintendent of public instruc
tion and nine other citizens, who aro
not in any way connected with the
'movie' industry.
Prof. Gray, with several others, was
largely instrumental in the recent
creation by the city of Palo Alto of
an amusement committee of nine
members which is to pass on all pub
lic amusements given in the city. In
this manner all objectionable films will
be removed by the board.
As a part of the movement for im
proved motion pictures, Prof. Gray
discussed the methods of obtaining
"better films" before the California
State Civic League in San Francisco,
Saturday.
