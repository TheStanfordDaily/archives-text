# TO HONOR WASHINGTON
## 
### 
*
Washington is one of the few great men on whose birthday the
Stanford academic machinery comes to a pause. For most of ns tomor
row will be a holiday of freedom, rest, and pleasure, according* to our
custom of honoring 1 those who have performed great services for their
country.
Vet many episodes in the life of our first president command interest
and admiration, and in reflection upon any of them true Stanford men
may stop profitably, if but for a moment. We are told by economists
today that our revolution was carried through largely by men with small
economic means. Still Washington, a member of the wealthy colonist
class, sided actively with the common patriots. Many of the comfortable
landed colonists were against war measures and in favor of the then
existing order, for it was deemed the safer to property interests. They
might have been correct in their calculations but for the contrary decision
of one of their own number, for we may easily imagine what would have
happened to that unfed, unclothed, unpaid army at Valley Forge under
any leader but Washington.
Members of Stanford University, which aims to develop broad
minded men of vision, character.' 4, and courage, may well consider a
moment the career of our first great leader, for the inspiration a memory
of his deeds should afford.
