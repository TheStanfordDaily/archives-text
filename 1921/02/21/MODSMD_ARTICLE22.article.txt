# WELCOME HOME THE TEAM

Stanford's varsity basketball team lost two crucial panics in the
race for the coast conference championship to the University of Wash
ington Friday and Saturday nights. The Cardinal quintet made a last
desperate statu!, only to lose by one point.
The rigors of a long journey and the difficulties of playing effective
basketball in five games within a period of nine days, against the
strongest teams of the Pacific Slope, can be appreciated only by those
who have made the trip. The showing of Coach Powell's five is highly
commendable.
All credit must be given the players of the University of Wash
ington. Tn their two appearances at Stanford they showed themselves
a gentlemanly lot of clean athletes, and their victory on their own court
is not surprising after the two fighting games they lost here. «
Coach Powell's team will now direct its entire strength in an attempt
to win the three-game series from the University of California five.
which now leads the conference.
