•
Ever since his early preparatory days,
when his interest in natural science was
first awakened, Professor Charles Henry
Gilbert of the Department of Zoology
has been constantly and wholly devoted
to his chosen work. His life has been
spent in unbroken study and work ujong
zoological lines, and in the capacity of
investigator in governmental research
work as well as in the educational field
he has contributed to the progress of
science, particularly in the study of
North American fishes. Here at Stan
ford Professor Gilbert, a member of
the pioneer faculty of 1891, has founded
j and developed the Zoology department
; which he directs at the present time,
i Professor Gilbert was born in Rock
j ford, Illinois, and received his prcpara
I tory education in the public schools of
j Indianapolis. It was at the Indianapolis
High School he lirst met Dr. Jordan,
! who. then a young man, was teaching
| there, and the two began what later
j became a lifelony association. In 1875
) Professor Gilbert's interest in natural
j science was stimulated in a class to
| which Dr. Jordan lectured, and the fol
j lowing year, when Dr. Jordan proposed
; to take a party of students on a walking
jtrip through the Southern States, it de-
I veloped that the party was ultimately
' made up of Dr. and Mrs. Jordan and
J Professor Gilbert.
The next year Professor Gilbert fol
lowed Dr. Jordan to Butler University,
j and they undertook similar tours for
j the next four years, studying animals,
! plants, and particularly fishes. In 1879
j Professor Gilbert received his B. S. de
! gree from Butler University, and the
! next two summers were spent in accom
j pauying Dr. Jordan on European tours.
| Then in 1880 lie came with Dr. Jordan
| to the Pacific Coast as assistant in tak
j ing the census of fisheries for the gov
j ernment report of 1880. They investi-
I gated fisheries from British Columbia
! to San Diego, and when Dr. Jordan was
i

I called back to Indiana, E'rofessor Gil
bert continued the work, going south as
far as Panama.
Professor Gilbert received his M. S.
from Indiana University in 1882 and his
Ph. D. from the same institution in
1883. He married Julia R. Hughes of
Bloomington. Indiana, in August of the
same year. From 1880 to 1884 Professor
Gilbert had been an assistant in natural
sciences at Indiana University and in
1884 he took up the post of professor of
natural history at the University of In
diana, where he remained until 1889. »
From 1889 to 1891 he was professor of
j zoology at Indiana University and since
| leaving Indiana he has occupied the chair
j of Professor of Zoology at Stanford.
Among the governmental positions
| which Professor Gilbert has held is that
'of assistant to the United States Fish
| cries Commission from 1880 to 1888. In
; 1889 and 1890 lie acted as naturalist in
| charge of the United States Fish Com
| mission steamer "Albatross," and* later,
in 1902 and; 1906, he Conducted seven
I cruises among the Hawaiian Islands and
in the Northwest Pacific and Japan. As
j a result of his investigations, a number
I of deep sea fishes, amounting to several
j hundred species previously unknown to
i science, were discovered.
In 1909 Professor Gilbert was made
i assistant in the International Fisheries
■ Commission, and during the past ten
i years has been in charge of expert
salmon investigations for the United
I States Bureau of Fisheries and the Brit
ish Columbia Fisheries Department.
; Professor Gilbert is the author of a
! "Synopsis of the Fishes of North Amer
i iea." which he wrote with David Starr
I Jordan in 1882, and of a book on "The j
' Deep Sea Fishes of the Hawaiian i
| Islands," published in 1905. He is also
; a contributor to the "Life History of the
j Sock-eye Salmon," and lias published a
| number of papers on North American
j fishes.
