## 
### 
Latest reports from the soccer field
indicate that Coach Maloney's team
will not be able to meet any soccer
team at Sacramento, 'as had been
| hoped for a while. Word was receiv
|ed from Sacramento that they could
| not get a team to oppose the varsity
in »lie hitter's proposed
northern California.
Another opponent is in sight, how
j ever, in the Grass Valley All Star
team. Coach Maloney was notified
!by the officials of that league that
they would like to meet the Stanford
eleven at any time most convenient
:to the latter. Maloney will set the
\ date some time soon and in all prob
ability the trip will be made. The
I game will be played on some Satur
| day afternoon. Grass Valley has a
i strong reputation in soccer circles, and
I the game will prove a good chance
j for si comparison between two sec
j tions of the state.
The American Legion Team of Palo
Alto, played the Chinese Y. M. C. A.
; soccer team Saturday and won, 2 to
1 1. The Legion team, composed most
ly of former Stanford men, played
better soccer than they have done so
far this season, and showed improve
ment especially in team-work.
The game was played at the Stadi
um in Golden Gate Park. The field
was in good shape, and there was little
wind blowing—ideal conditions for a
good game. A good-sized crowd was
out to watch the proceedings. The
one point made by the Chinese was j
the result of a penalty kick.

; lows:
Hays and McGilvray, fullbacks;
