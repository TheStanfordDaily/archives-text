# Cercle Francais Will See Travel Posters
## 
### 
Travel posters, advertising the various
scenic routes for which France is noted,
will be a feature of the meeting of the
Cercle Francais which will be held on
Wednesday evening in the Women's
Clubhouse at 8 p. m. These posters, of
which there are some twenty-five, were
sent to the local club by a FreVich rail
way company, the Paris-Lyons-Mediter
ranean.
It has been arranged to place the
posters on the walls of the room so
that all may have an opportunity to
examine them. The remainder of the
evening will be taken up with French
games and conversation.
