Simpson after graduating from the i
University of the Pacific, as it was j
then, and a short time on San Jose l
newspapers, went on the staff of the
San Francisco Chronicle, where he j
stayed for twenty years as telegraph ;
editor and night editor. In 1913 he j
left the Chronicle to become managing j
editor of the Sacramento Union, which !
was reorganized at that time. After
two years he bought a controlling in
terest in the paper, but the war com

out.

purchased it, Simpson returned to

newspaper methods and aims and (

the opportunities and responsibilities
of present-day journalism, as he sees
them. He will speak informally from j
the viewpoint of* a practical news
paper man who is interested in the j
future of his profession.
The meeting will be held in the
Stanford Inn, where one of the small
dining rooms has been secured for
