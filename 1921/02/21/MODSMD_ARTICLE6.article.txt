month's Pictorial, this time as a globe
trotting observer instead of editor, in

articles last quarter. "Notes of a Rub
berneck" is tlie title of the story of his
impressions. Kenny stayed for a time
in New York and his experiences there
and aboard ship en route to Europe he
tells in this article.
The most emotional part of the voy
age seems to have been that portion
immediately following the third mile.
In this connection Kenny notes the in
sight of the steamship company, for as
he looked in the register he found him
self listed as a saloon passenger.
"Some Basic Factors of the Japanese
Question" is the title of a contribution
by Professor Payson J. Treat. The
three most important aspects of the
problem are the number of Japanese
already residents of California, the ap
parently increasing immigration, and the
seeming unassimilability of the race, ac
cording to this article. Professor Treat
is an authority on the Far East and is
particularly interested in this problem.
Mel ha Berry, '22, is the author of
"Rumoritis," dealing, as its title indi
cates,' with rumors, materialized and
otherwise. The good old matrimonial
rumor, the scholarship dope, all about
how so-and-so stepped into that litera
ture course just in time to save himself
from the G. 8., and those athletic and
specialized rumors that are forever cur
rent and so seldom proved, arc consid
ered with the regret that no means of
combatting this has yet been discovered.
