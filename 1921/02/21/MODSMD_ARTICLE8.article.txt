# FACULTY HEADS ENDORSE HONOR SYSTEM REVIVAL
## Plan Discussed in Letters Received by Committee Investigating the Possibility 
### 
Further faculty approval of the re
vival of an honor system at Stanford
has been received by the committee
investigating its possibility. Profes
sor R. W. Doane, head of the Depart
ment of Entomology and Bionomics,
Professor Harris J. Ryan, head of the
Department of Electrical Engineering,
and Professor W. P. Durand, head of
the Department of Electrical Engineer
ing, have written letters endorsing
the agitation toward such a system.
These communications follow:
Editor Daily Palo Alto: —The stu
dents and faculty in the department
of Electrical Engineering, have no
problem in regard to the conduct of
examinations. No difficulty has been
met in carrying out the regulations
in force in recent years. Putting
each man on his honor is heartily
favored. By so doing the great ma
jority of every class will co-operate
to see that all tests are met honestly.
Cordially yours,
HARRIS J. RYAN.
My Dear Mr. Brown: —Referring to
our recent conversation regarding the
honor system, I am glad to assure you
on behalf of the Department of Me
chanical Engineering of our cordial
sympathy with the idea of an honor
system and of the very ready wel
come and support which we should
be glad to extend to such a system. It
is clear that any such system, in
order to succeed, must, be based upon
a solid, definite student sentiment in
favor thereof and if such system can
be thus established through the initi
ative of the students or of student
organizations representing forward
loflfrg student sentiment, this De
pamnent may be counted on to lend
every possible co-operation and aid
in making of such a movement a con
tinuing success.
Cordially yours,
W. F. DURAND.
Mr. George M. Kyle, Chairman,
Honor Committee. Dear Sir: —I have
been asked what our department
thinks of > the honor system.
The Department of Entomology and
Bionomics has always assumed that
the students studying with us .were
no longer children but had attained,
to some degree, at least, a state of
young manhood and womanhood that
i should carry with it a sense of moral
! and intellectual responsibility and in
dependence. It is true that this confi
i dence has sometimes been misplaced
j and it has been necessary to place
! occasional students in the children's
! class and deal with them as children
, from the grades of the lower schools.
I On the whole, however, we find that
the students respond in a most satis
factory way to any system that ap
! peals to them as fair and square, and
! we believe that if the so-called "honor
| system" was adopted in ALL the deal
j ings with the students, that they would
! meet the proposition in the spirit in
which it was given.
If the "honor system" is simply a
| question as to whether an instructor
I shall be in a classroom during an ex
| amihation period, the discussion is
! hardly worth the while. If a stu
dent wills to cheat, the presence of
j an instructor will have very little in
j fiuence one way or the other, but if
j the sentiment) if the student body
j makes cheating an abomination and a
! thing not to be countenanced, it will
! soon become so unpopular \ that it
will no longer be practiced here.
And while we are discussing honor
and fair play for all, why not consider
i the question of reference books that
j so often must be seen by a large num
ber of students in a comparatively
j short time. It may be thoughtlessless,
; but more often it is selfishness and
j a total disregard of honor and fair
play that will prompt a student to
steal or hide a book when he knows
that a class of perhaps fifty or a hun
dred other students need the book
j just as much as he does. This thing
I has become all too common here. Let
us all, instructors, students, and every
body else, try to be honorable and
fair in ALL of our dealings.
R. W. DOANE.
Department of Entomology.
