The final round of the women's in
terclass basketball series will start
next Thursday afternoon on Roble
field, at 4:20, with two games, one

teams and the other between the
seniors and sophomores. The fresh
man-junior game was originally sched
uled for Tuesday afternoon, but ow
ing to the holiday was postponed. The
first game will begin at 4:20.
The preliminary series ended last
week with the juniors in first place,
having won all the games in which
they participated; the freshmen sec
ond, with two victories to their cre
dit; the sophomores third, with one,
and the seniors last with none. The
playing and scores in these games
will be taken in consideration in mak

dividual player, but will not count
either for or against the class team
in the finals. »

es, the final one of which is scheduled
between the juniors and sophomores
on March 9. The last of the prelimin

will be greater support on the side
lines during the next half of the tour
nament.
