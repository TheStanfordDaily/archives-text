# VARSITY BEGINS WORK FOR GAME WITH CALIFORNIA
## Team Takes Rest for One Day After Return from North Before Resuming Practice 
### 
Varsity practice on the home floor was
again resumed this afternoon in prepara
tion for the second game of the Stan
ford-California seties. Coach Powell
and eight men arrived on the campus
Monday night after a ten-day invasion
of the north and a well-earned rest was
taken yesterday. The men are in fair
condition with the exception of a few
minor injuries, and with a good workout
the remainder of the week should be in
the best shape for the California game
Saturday.
Although there is no possibility of
winning the Pacific Coast Conference
championship now, Stanford still has a
chance of coming out on top of the
California-Nevada League and of win
ning the state title. Should Stanford
win the game with California Saturday,
they will be tied with the Blue and Gold
in the local league and will have an
opportunity of winning the title in the
third and deciding game. Should there
be a third game, the place will be de
cided later, as no definite arrangements
have been made at present.
"Although California has a good team,
1 do not feel that we played our best
game against them in the first of the
series," stated Coach Powell in refer
ence to the coming game, "and I feel
sure that we will give them a real battle
on our own floor Saturday night."
California will probably use the En
cina court for practice Thursday and
Friday, while the Cardinal varsity will
practice as usual up until the California
game.
