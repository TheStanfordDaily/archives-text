# HOLIDAY MUSICAL PROGRAM IS GIVEN IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Campus Organizations Present Good Program; "Florist Shop" is Successful Comedy 
### (By Mary Jane Clark, '22 
An interesting and entertaining varia
tion of the season's musical series was
the Washington's Birthday program
given in the Assembly Hall last evening
by the University musical organizations.
The program was different in that it
was given entirely by campus talent,
and was interesting in content as well
as in showing the work that our musical
organizations are doing. The entertain
ment was presented by the Schubert
Club, the Glee Club, the University Or
chestra, and the University Band, and a
one-act plav, "The Florist Shop," was
contributed by the members of Coach
Gordon Davis' class in dramatic inter
pretation. The proceeds were for the
benefit of the European Students' Fund.
The University Band displayed its
ability to advantage under the direction
of Professor Ernest Whitney Martin.
The opening number was Raff's Sym
phony "Leonore," which was followed
by Lubomirsky's "Danse Orientale," a
very pleasing number A variation of
"Maryland, My Maryland," the next se
lection, was particularly favorable to
band interpretation.
Appearing for the first time this year,
the Schubert Club offered three very de
lightful songs, light in character, but
sung with finish. Among them, "All*
Through the Night," an old Welsh air,
was especially appealing.
The Universitv Orchestra, directed by
Warren D. Allen, accompanied the
Schubert Club and Glee Club selections
and also contributed two numbers, the
"Merry Wives of Windsor" overture
and Tschaikowsky's "Song Without
Words." The interpretation of both
numbers was complete both from an
orchestral and an artistic standpoint.
The orchestra also played "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail," and the "Star Spangled
Banner," in which the audience joined,
at the end of the program.
One of the most popular numbers was
the group of songs given by the Glee
Club, which included Coleridge-Taylor's
spirited "Viking Song," and a very dif
ferent and amusing little arrangement,
"Call John," which won instant re
sponse. The club contains some good
voices and is doing excellent work this
year.
"The Florist Shop," directed by Coach
Davis, was a very clever little one-act
comedy, full of humorous situations and
giving opportunity for competent acting.
The parts were well taken, Melba Berry,
'22, playing the lead, that of Maude, the
sympathetic and philanthropic clerk who
manages both the business of the shop
and the affairs of the customers as well.
Katherinc Reid, '21, as Miss Wells; H.
Hollis Chalmers, '23, as Mr. Jackson,
and Harrington Wells, '23, as Henry,
made the most of the comedy situations
of their parts, and Arnold Bayley, '23,
as the Hebrew proprietor, did some par
ticularly good character work.
