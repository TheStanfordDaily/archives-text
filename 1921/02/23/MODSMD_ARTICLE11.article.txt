# HOLIDAY MUSICAL PROGRAM IS GIVEN IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Campus Organizations Present Good Program; "Florist Shop" is Successful Comedy 
### (By Mary Jane Clark, '22 
An interesting and entertaining varia
tion of the season's musical series was
the Washington's Birthday program
given in the Assembly Hall last evening
by the University musical organizations.
The program was different in that it
was given entirely by campus talent,
and was interesting in content as well
as in showing the work that our musical
organizations are doing. The entertain
ment was presented by the Schubert
Club, the Glee Club, the University Or
chestra, and the University Band, and a
one-act plav, "The Florist Shop," was
contributed by the members of Coach
Gordon Davis' class in dramatic inter
pretation. The proceeds were for the
benefit of the European Students' Fund.
The University Band displayed its
ability to advantage under the direction
of Professor Ernest Whitney Martin.
The opening number was Raff's Sym
phony "Leonore," which was followed
by Lubomirsky's "Danse Orientale," a
very pleasing number A variation of
"Maryland, My Maryland," the next se
lection, was particularly favorable to
band interpretation.
Appearing for the first time this year,
the Schubert Club offered three very de
lightful songs, light in character, but
sung with finish. Among them, "All*
Through the Night," an old Welsh air,
was especially appealing.
