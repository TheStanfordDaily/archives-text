# CLUBHOUSE DEMANDS DEPOSIT TO COVER LOSSES IN FUTURE
## 
### 
Repeated loss of property from the
Women's Clubhouse has forced the
Board of Directors to make a ruling
that hereafter all organizations giv
ing dances there must make a deposit
to cover these losses. If nothing is
stolen or broken, the deposit will be
returned. The new ruling went into
effect last Monday.
During the past week, thefts from
the clubhouse have been worse than
previously. The most recent losses
are a large mirror from the wall of
the women's dressing room and a valu
able flower basket on the third floor.
Punch bowls and clocks have repeated
ly disappeared during dances and
windows have frequently been broken,
according to the directors.
The object of the new ruling is to
shift the responsibility from the -chib
house to -the student organizations
using the building, in the that
the roughs may be disc.ouragff; frpm
future malicious mischief.
