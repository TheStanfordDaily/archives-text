# PICTORIAL FOR MARCH WILL APPEAR TUESDAY
## "Popular Pastimes" as Well as "Indoor Sports" Are Featured in This Edition 
### 
The Stanford Pictorial will be
placed on sale the day after tomor
placed on sale Tuesday, March 1.
The illustrated section of this i?eue
will contain several interesting pages
of cuts besides the center spread. A
whole page is given over to the mili
tary and another to "Popular Pas
times," a section similar to the "In
door Sports" in the January issue,
and there are numerous illustrations
as well.
"Popular Pastimes," might have
been called "The By-ways of Knowl
edge." The Great American game is
shown in executive session—a session
which seems to be presided over by a
heart flush, clearly shown in the fore
ground. The fickle frolickers are
shown frivoling away father's liberty
bonds, and opposite—a photograph so
"still" that one feels sure that the
poetic curfew has tolled the knell of
parting day. Last, but not to be over
looked and the most touching of all —
Hon and Dearie in action. The
photographer is certainly to be con
gratulated on obtaining a picture of
such a unique situation. H. J. Borba,
'22, describes the group very cleverly.
Stanford's newest sport, polo, ap
pears spectacularly in connection with
the page of military cuts. No matter
how little one knows about polo these
pictures will surely be appreciated as
there is spirited action in every one
of them. The charging horses and
the sweeping sticks are exciting even
in a photograph. A picture of a
home taking the hurdles is another
handsome cut on this page.
The center spread has the intra-J
mural basketball teams which are j
champions of their respective leagues, j
as the main subject and also contains
pictures of the men who have been
prominent (luring the last month. |
