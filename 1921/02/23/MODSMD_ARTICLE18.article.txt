made this quarter in 1 order to cut
down the work that will have to be
dons at the opening of the spring
session.
The Carnival this year will be a
larger affair than ever before if the
plans of the manager come out ac
cording to specification. Work on the
details is to be started at once and
the various groups that will offer en
tertainment will have a longer time
to work up the original sketches that
have proved to be so popular in the
past. ..
This season in addition to the home
talent stunts that have been put on
before, there will probably be some
talent from outside as one of the main
attractions.
Petrini will organize his commitee
tomorrow into the various depart
ments and start them on their assign
ments. He asks that all the ap
pointees make it a point to come to
this first meeting on lime in order that
the business may be disposed with
and the plans started without delay.
