# SPANISH STUDENTS KNOW DR. AURELIO ESPINOSA
## 
### 
There are few students of Spanish
who have nof heard of Dr. Aureiio
Macedonio Espinosa of the Stanford
Romanic Languages.
His research work subsequent
publications have made him an author
ity on the language. »
Although he fell into the work by
accident, Dr. Espinosa has been teach
ing Romanic Languages ever since his
graduation from the University of
Colorado in 1902. Born of Spanish
parents in 1880, he entered the uni
versity of that state in 1898 as a
Latin major. After being graduated,
he was a Spanish instructor while
working for his master's degree which
was granted in 1904.
Dr. Espinosa left Colorado for the
University of Mexico where he taught
for live years before going to the Uni
versity of Chicago to receive his
doctor's degree, in 1909. After that
he came* to Stanford where lie has
been ever since as an associate pro
fessor in the Romanic Languages de
partment.
Dr. Espinosa has made two trips to
Europe, having only recently
to this country after six months of
research work in Spain. While there
last year he collected 300 folk lore
tales for the American Folklore So
ciety. These will soon be organized
.to constitute at least two large vo
lumes. The professor has been par
ticularly active in work along this
line and is associate editor of the
Journal of American Folklore. In the
last ten years he has published eleven
articles on that subject in this one
magazine,
Ballads have also furnished founda
tion for research and he has publish
ed collections from New Mexico and
Porto Rico. He has now the material
for a publication on the modern
Spanish drama, which he has been
investigating for some time.
Dr. Espinosa's real interest is in
comparative philology and it is in

this branch of the work that he se
cured his doctor's degree. He is now
working in conjunction with Navarro
Thomas on a book of Spanish phone
tics.
In the aggregate publications from
his pen have approached the hundred
mark and have been chiefly philologic
al and liteiary works and text books.
He has published two grammars which
were writt n in conjunction with Pro
fessor Clifford G. Allen of the local
departments Several of his books
have been published in France, Ger
many and Spain.
Two of particular interest are
Spanish translations of stories by Dr.
David Starr Jordan, published in
Spain. They are "The Human Har
vest" and "The Unseen Empire."*
In addition to his editorial position
on the Journal of American Folklore,
Dr. Espinosa is editor of Hispania, a
magazine published by the American
Association of Spanish teachers. He
is a corresponding member of the
Mexican Geological Society, the Chili
Folklore Society and the Hispanic So
ciety.
Although the professor has made
only two trips abroad he has lived in
n Spanish atmosphere throughout his
life, and his accent would not lead
one to believe that he is a native
American. Dr. Espinosa's parents were
Spaniards and in 1905 lie was married
in New Mexico to a womaji of Span
ish parentage. They now have five
children who are looking froward to
a Stanford education.
The Americanization of Spanish life
in Europe particularly impressed Dr.
Espinbsa on his trip last year. He
noticed that Fords and other Amer
ican-made articles were everywhere
in evidence and that the people are
adopting American customs. It is no
exaggeration to say that it is men
such as he who are bringing about this
closer relation between the two
countries.

in New Mexico to a womaji of Span
ish parentage. They now have five
children who are looking froward to
a Stanford education.
The Americanization of Spanish life
in Europe particularly impressed Dr.
Espinbsa on his trip last year. He
noticed that Fords and other Amer
ican-made articles were everywhere
in evidence and that the people are
adopting American customs. It is no
exaggeration to say that it is men
such as he who are bringing about this
closer relation between the two
countries.
There are few students of Spanish
who have nof heard of Dr. Aureiio
Macedonio Espinosa of the Stanford
Romanic Languages.
His research work subsequent
publications have made him an author
ity on the language. »
Although he fell into the work by
accident, Dr. Espinosa has been teach

graduation from the University of
Colorado in 1902. Born of Spanish
parents in 1880, he entered the uni
versity of that state in 1898 as a
Latin major. After being graduated,
he was a Spanish instructor while
working for his master's degree which
was granted in 1904.
Dr. Espinosa left Colorado for the
University of Mexico where he taught
for live years before going to the Uni
versity of Chicago to receive his
doctor's degree, in 1909. After that
he came* to Stanford where lie has
been ever since as an associate pro
fessor in the Romanic Languages de
partment.
Dr. Espinosa has made two trips to
Europe, having only recently
to this country after six months of
research work in Spain. While there
last year he collected 300 folk lore
tales for the American Folklore So
ciety. These will soon be organized
.to constitute at least two large vo
lumes. The professor has been par
ticularly active in work along this
line and is associate editor of the
Journal of American Folklore. In the
last ten years he has published eleven
articles on that subject in this one
magazine,
Ballads have also furnished founda
tion for research and he has publish
ed collections from New Mexico and
Porto Rico. He has now the material
for a publication on the modern
Spanish drama, which he has been
investigating for some time.
Dr. Espinosa's real interest is in
comparative philology and it is in

this branch of the work that he se
cured his doctor's degree. He is now
working in conjunction with Navarro
Thomas on a book of Spanish phone
tics.
In the aggregate publications from
his pen have approached the hundred
mark and have been chiefly philologic
al and liteiary works and text books.
He has published two grammars which
were writt n in conjunction with Pro
fessor Clifford G. Allen of the local
departments Several of his books
have been published in France, Ger
many and Spain.
Two of particular interest are
Spanish translations of stories by Dr.
David Starr Jordan, published in
Spain. They are "The Human Har
vest" and "The Unseen Empire."*
In addition to his editorial position
on the Journal of American Folklore,
Dr. Espinosa is editor of Hispania, a
magazine published by the American
Association of Spanish teachers. He
is a corresponding member of the
Mexican Geological Society, the Chili
Folklore Society and the Hispanic So
ciety.
Although the professor has made
only two trips abroad he has lived in
n Spanish atmosphere throughout his
life, and his accent would not lead
one to believe that he is a native
American. Dr. Espinosa's parents were
