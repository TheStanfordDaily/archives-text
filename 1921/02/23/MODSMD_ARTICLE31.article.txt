# "Yellow Jacket" is True Comedy of Oriental Tupes
## 
### 
George Washington himself could
write the advertisements for the
"Yellow Jacket" without hurting his
reputation in the least. This Oriental
drama of love, laughter, and tears
which the English Club will present
on March Bth is one that truly de
serves praise and one that will ap
peal to the campus publjf- especially.
College students like cleverness and
action and have little patience with
dramatic crudities. When Handsome
Harold in a movie thriller overcomes
six huskies all bigger than himself he
doesn't get applause but receives the
merry haw-haw. Such heroics are an
insult to the intelligence.
The "Yellow J-acket," however, will
keep anyone interested. The audacity
of its humor, the novelty of its setting
and of its story keep your
attention continually fixed upon it. It
is a classic with a punch.
