# Intelligence Tests Are Explained by Terman
## 
### 
Prof. Lewis M. Terman, at a meet
ing of the Faculty Forum last Mon
day night, discussed the various phases
of the intelligence tests, which were
employed so extensively in the Army
during the war and which are being
more and more used in schools and
colleges. It has been discovered, the
speaker declared, that students who
leave college claiming ill health, fi
nancial difficulties, or inability to find
desired courses are below the average
in the tests.
Dr. O. M. Elliott was elected presi
dent of the Forum for the ensuing
year and Professor A. M. Cathcart
