# STANFORD MAN PLANS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH PARTY IN THE ORIENT
## 
### 
James E. Hicks, '22, is planning to
conduct a party to the Orient during
the summer vacation which will be
primarily interested in studying the
historical and economic life of Japan
and China.
With this purpose in view a 3000-
mile inland journey has been arranged
for. Startiug from Tokio the party
will go by rail through the main island
touching at Kobe on the way to Shi
monoseki, the southeastern port; then
across to Fusan at the southern ex
tremity of Korea and striking north
ward up the peninsula they will touch
at Seoul, the Korean capital, en route
to Mukden, Manchuria.
Prom Mukden the Chinese govern
ment railroad runs eastward to Pek
ing, crossing the Great Wall, then
southward through the heart of China
to Hankow on the Yang-Tze river,
and the party will take this route,
stopping for a day or so at Peking
to explore the ancient shrines and
Buddha temples. A boat trip from
Hankow down the Yang-Tze to Shang
hai will give an intimate view of Chi
nese river life. This ancient river-is
lined with boats and teeming with
the congested life of the Orient.
Embarking at Shanghai the party
will go to Manila and then across to
Hong Kong. On the homeward trip
the route leads back to Japan and
the famous inland sea voyage from
Nagasaki to Kobe between the two
main islands will prove one of the
most beautiful and instructive v fea
tures of the trip.
Professor Payson J. Treat of the
History Department and an authority
on History of the Far East has kindly
offered his assistance in planning aÂ«
pleasing historical itinerary which
will greatly increase the edu'oational
benefits of the trip.
