## 
### 
Prince'ton University is not in favor
of intersectional football contests and
would never consider an invitation to
come Wot and participate in a game
of that nature.
This, in substance, composed the re
marks of Hill Roper; head football coach
at Princeton, delivered at a banquet of
Princeton alumni in St. Louis. He di
rectly attacked the annual game played
at Pasadena on New Year's day and
made it plain that his school would never
lie a party to such a contest. He said
that Princeton had already been sounded
out as to coming to the coast next year
and had flatly refused.
He also made the point that the an
nual Pasadena game is hardly a fair
test of the relative prowess of the oppos
ing teams due to the tiresome, long jour
ney from the East. He further pre
dicted that the next East vs. West game
would have to be played in the East.
