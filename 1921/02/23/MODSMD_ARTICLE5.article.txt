# FIRST BAWL GAME OF SEASON SATURDAY
## Varsity Meets San Francisco American Legion Team In Contest on Local Diamond 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay's baseball machine
will get under way in its first game of
the season when it meets an American
Legion team of San Francisco on the
local diamond next Saturday afternoon.
The squad has been slowly working into
shape for the last month, and Coach
Seay has great confidence that the Car
dinal will come through strong, this
season.
Five men are in line for the mound
position: Draper, Green, Kelly Nef.
and Haley. Three of these hurlers will
be used in the Saturday' game. Either
Bundy or Holston will hold down the
other end of the battery. The infield
men are steadily and surely getting their
eyes on the hop. Patterson is likely to
cover the initial sack, and Mitchell will
guard the territory around second. Kal
lam and Maillot will divide the honors
at short, with Crowe and Heckendorf
holding each other to a tight race for
third.
In the outfield Carver, Wayland, and
Kline will probably start the game.
From now on the varsity will play
two games every week, probably each
Wednesday and Saturday. Coach Seay
is arranging for a trip south during
spring vacation, but no definite plans
have been reached.
