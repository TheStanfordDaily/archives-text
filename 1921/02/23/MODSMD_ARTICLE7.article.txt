# MILITARY OUTING TO SEARSVILLE ENJOYED
## 
### 
The rcccntly organized military honor
society, Pi Kappa Tan, was host to the
women's equitation class and other spe
cially invited guests, who, in all, num
bered more than fifty persons, at a
Searsville outing yesterday. The horses
were furnished through the courtesy of
the local military department.
The fact that yesterday was a Uni
vcrsity holiday and in addition an ideal
day combined to make the trip a com
plete success.
The return to the campus was late in
the afternoon.
