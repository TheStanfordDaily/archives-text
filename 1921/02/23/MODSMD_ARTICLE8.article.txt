# NEW BASIS FOR ADMITTANCE HAS FACULTY APPROVAL
## Characters to be Considered In Selecting Applicants For Entrance in Future 
### 
Selection of new students on the basis
of character, leadership, and exceptional
ability as well as scholarship is provided
in the entrance requirements approved
Monday afternoon by the faculty. Ten
tative plans proposed by students and
faculty for a revision off entrance re
quirements and discussed for several
months were whipped into a definite
form by the action of the Monday meet
ing and will serve as the guide in ad
mitting new students next autumn.
The present regulation limiting the
number of first-year men entrants to
450 for the autumn quarter and SO each
for the two succeeding quarters is re
tained. In event the number of candi
dates fulfilling the scholastic require
ments exceeds 450, an eligible list will
be made on which men who meet the
new qualifications will be placed. # j'orce
of character, courage, and honesty are
characteristics which will aid a candi
date desiring his name on the list. Other
qualifications giving a man a preference
are scholarship, exceptional ability of
any kind, qualitic '■> of leadership exerted
among schoolmates and associates, and
physical vigor. Sons of alumni of Stan
ford will upon request be included on
the list.
Not only will inclusion on the eligible
list be secured by a candidate present
ing the all-around qualifications outlined
by the regulations, but the names of
persons awarded regional scholarships
and those .vho havi' compre
hensive" examinations will be placed on
the list. An average grade of 75 will
be required of those who have passed
the examinations of the College l'.n
trance Examination Board.
The new regulations are applicable to
men and women equally. While the
present "preferred list ' will continue in
force for any women who are now on
the list, the revised rules will govern
the admission of all other candidates.
The Registrar expects that in three or
four years the preferred list will have
worked itself out and that all women
will be governed by the new rules.
Daughters of the academic staff, how
ever, receive a preference which is not
accorded sons of the professors.
In respect to the admission of stu
dents with advanced standing, a distinc
tion is made between men and women.
No limitation is placed upon the num
ber of men entering with at least a year
and a half of college credits, while the
women are governed by the 500 limit
rule.
In one respect the new rules make ad
mission more difficult. Previously, men
who graduated from preparatory schools
with twelve units of a recommended
grade have not been barred from enter
ing. The revised rules admit only those
who have completed fifteen units of
high school studies with a recommended
grade.
The action of the faculty was taken
because of the pressure of candidates
for admission has been so intense that
the present system has become unwork
able. Particularly in regard to women,
the preferred list now in vogue has pre
sented insurmountabU* difficulties to ad
mission to women who were not familiar
with the requirements three and four
years prior to the date they desired to
register. The new rules, the committee
on scholarship believes, will not only
lie just but will ensure that only the
best qualified of high school graduates
will be admitted.
Minor changes in the rules provide
that two days be officially designated
for registration purposes for the autumn
quarter, the lirst day to be assigned
primarily for the Lower Division fresh
men and to precede the regular calendar
date for registration.

force for any women who are now on
the list, the revised rules will govern
the admission of all other candidates.
The Registrar expects that in three or
four years the preferred list will have
worked itself out and that all women
will be governed by the new rules.
Daughters of the academic staff, how
ever, receive a preference which is not
accorded sons of the professors.
In respect to the admission of stu
dents with advanced standing, a distinc
tion is made between men and women.
No limitation is placed upon the num
ber of men entering with at least a year
and a half of college credits, while the
women are governed by the 500 limit
rule.
In one respect the new rules make ad
mission more difficult. Previously, men
who graduated from preparatory schools
with twelve units of a recommended
grade have not been barred from enter
ing. The revised rules admit only those
who have completed fifteen units of
high school studies with a recommended
grade.
The action of the faculty was taken
because of the pressure of candidates
for admission has been so intense that
the present system has become unwork
able. Particularly in regard to women,
the preferred list now in vogue has pre
sented insurmountabU* difficulties to ad
mission to women who were not familiar
with the requirements three and four
years prior to the date they desired to
register. The new rules, the committee
on scholarship believes, will not only
lie just but will ensure that only the
best qualified of high school graduates
will be admitted.
Minor changes in the rules provide
that two days be officially designated
for registration purposes for the autumn
quarter, the lirst day to be assigned
primarily for the Lower Division fresh
men and to precede the regular calendar
date for registration.
Selection of new students on the basis
of character, leadership, and exceptional
ability as well as scholarship is provided
in the entrance requirements approved
Monday afternoon by the faculty. Ten
tative plans proposed by students and
faculty for a revision off entrance re
quirements and discussed for several
months were whipped into a definite
form by the action of the Monday meet
ing and will serve as the guide in ad
mitting new students next autumn.
The present regulation limiting the
number of first-year men entrants to
450 for the autumn quarter and SO each
for the two succeeding quarters is re
tained. In event the number of candi
dates fulfilling the scholastic require
ments exceeds 450, an eligible list will
be made on which men who meet the
new qualifications will be placed. # j'orce
of character, courage, and honesty are
characteristics which will aid a candi
date desiring his name on the list. Other
qualifications giving a man a preference
are scholarship, exceptional ability of
any kind, qualitic '■> of leadership exerted
among schoolmates and associates, and
physical vigor. Sons of alumni of Stan
ford will upon request be included on
the list.
Not only will inclusion on the eligible
list be secured by a candidate present
ing the all-around qualifications outlined
by the regulations, but the names of
persons awarded regional scholarships
and those .vho havi' compre
hensive" examinations will be placed on
the list. An average grade of 75 will
be required of those who have passed
the examinations of the College l'.n
trance Examination Board.
The new regulations are applicable to
men and women equally. While the
present "preferred list ' will continue in
force for any women who are now on
