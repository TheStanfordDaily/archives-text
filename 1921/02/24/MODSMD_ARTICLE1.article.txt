California's varsity journeyed from
Berkeley last night and held a secret
practice on the Encina floor between 7
and 9 o'clock. The Blue and Gold squad
has had the advantage over the Cardinal
in not having as long a northern trip
and show less effects in rounding back
into top form.
The Stanford varsity held the first
practice since its return from the north
yesterday afternoon, Coach Powell giv
ing the men a light practice to work out
the effects of the long ride. Although
but little time is left before the game
to practice, Coach Powell cxpccts to
have the men "in shape to show their
best brand of ball Saturday evening.
Davics will probably start Saturday's
game at forward, with Rightcr, v Mills,
Richmond, and Adams at their usual
places. Davies showed up well on' the
northern trip and was the most consist
ent point-gainer for the Cardinal. Coach
Powell will have good reserves in Rog
ers, Carver, and Anderson to call upon
should go wrong with any of
the first live.
