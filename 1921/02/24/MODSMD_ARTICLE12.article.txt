# WEIGHT Mi INCREASED BY REPORTING OF ADAMS
## First Warm Day Finds Track Swarming With Athletes Working Winter Kinks Out 
### 
Fred Adams made his first appear
ance this season on the oval yester
day afternoon and heaved the shot
with such a vengeance that he is
considered as a strong contender in
this event. "Red" Tauzer is also
showing up good and is putting a lot
of zip behind the brass ball. Samp
son is built for the job but is having
a battle to get into form.
Yesterday was the first good day
for track this season and the summer
heat took out many a kink and gave
the boys the edge on shin splints and
other results of the last month's rain
and cold.
Captain Kirkjsey and A1 Carrey are
leading waj?~anead in the sprints with
a number of new men showing better
every day. Jess Wells, Bob Williams,
>nd Lane Faulk are taking the hurdles
with fine form for this early in the
season.
Thompson, Hertel and Ken Wright
are working well in the quarter;
Carlsmith, Williamson, and Murphy
arc gradually cutting down the time
in the half, with Carlsmith leading by
a shade.
"Louie" Minsky and "Charlie" Long
are approaching the take-off with more
confidence every night in the broad
jump. Yesterday's heat gave them
more spring and the dry sawdust was
a little more pleasant than the wet
mush they had been hitting during
the rains.
Tauzer, for the Varsity, and Hart
ranft and Bowers for the first-year
men, sailed the discus out with more
than their usual heave and its brass
edges glistened bright in the sunshine
as it soared through the air.
