# NEW ELECTRIC TIMER INSTALLED ON OVAL
## 
### 
A new electric timer was installed |
on the Stanford oval yesterday after-;
noon with the compliments of the j
Psychology Department, sponsored by
Dr. Frank Angell. This delicate ap
paratus catches the time of the cinder
path men to within a hundreth of a ,
second. C. S. Draper, '21, was in
charge of its installation.
The running of the watch, which is
a large clock-like affair in a liard
v/ood box, and the movement of the
hand on its three-inch dial are inde
pendent, allowing the watch to run
all the time during the races. Con-;
nection is made with starting gun j
through a fine wire stretched across
the muzzle which is broken by the
wadding of the blank charge.
Fine wire is also used for the tape i
as it was found that a cotton tape had
too much stretch in it to obtain ae- j
curate results. F. D. Banham, Uni
versity Mechanician, made the finish j
contact at the tape post, which stops j
the hand of the dial the instant that
the runner strikes the wire. This
finely adjusted part tof the set is of
the utmost importance to accuracy
as it is delicate enough to be set for
a difference of wind or other varia
tion.
This is the first electric timer on
the coast and one of the few of Its
kind in tjje United States. It was
originated in England and used there
for track events and horse racing.
Several trials with it yesterday cor
responded with the hand watchea and
there is no doubt but that it will be
a complete success.
