# SEAY'S BASEBALL NINE WILL PLAY OPENER SATURDAY
## Men are Instructed in Base-Running' and Sliding; All Are Rounding into Shape 
### 
Coach Sony- is putting the- varsity
baseball squad through two hours of
hard work every afternoon in prcpara
tion for the first game of the season,
which will be played on next Saturday
afternoon with American Legion Post
No. 4ft of San Francisco.
The Legioners have a fast chib and
have defeated some of the fastest nines
around t he Bay. They recently played
the St. Mary's College team and lost
a hard contest 2 to 0. This should give
an idea of their strength, for the men
of the Oakland institution, under the
tutelage of "Duster" Mails, Cleveland
American League pitcher and world's
series hero, have developed one of the
classiest teams in the Western college
class.
Five slabsters are working out daily,
and Johnny Couch of the San Francisco
Coast League team is giving them per
sonal instruction on three days a week.
Draper, Green, Kelly, Nef, and Haley
are the men from whom Coach Seay
will choose his hurlers for Saturday's
game. The choice to seems to lie
between the first three. Draper will in
all probability start the fracas, but Green
and Kelly are almost certain to pitch a
few innings.
Seay spent yesterday afternoon in
schooling the men in the petty larceny of
the national pastimeâ€”how to hook a
bag. He had the forty cohorts sliding
into the specially constructed pit for
half an hour and then took them onto
the diamond, where they showed their
ability in falling away from the baseman
when running the bases.
The men are slowly acquiring their
batting eyes and the fielding is also be
coming more perfect with each practice.
