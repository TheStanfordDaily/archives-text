Candidates chosen from high school graduates by regional alumni
associations and sent to Stanford because of desirable qualities df citizen
ship and leadership, by the new entrance plan are for the present reason.

recommended units. With this understanding the regional scholarship
idea becomes a definite, practicable possibility.
There was less incentive for organizations of graduates to finance
scholarships and send to the University men whom the*)' thought deserv
ing when it was possible and even probable that their candidate would
qualify for the waiting list only. Many of the most desirable among the
high school graduates are students who have worked their way through
school, and who therefore do not top the "honor list" in studies. Often
a "II" grade received by one pupil indicates greater comparative ability
than the "A" secured by his classmate, and perhaps fifteen recommended
units earned by a man working his way through high school may mean
more than a straight "A" card. Certainly when a student has so worked
his way and earned his recommended units, and when in addition lie has
taken a leading part in student activity, he should be worth} of any
university which aims to produce real men. Certainly, if the announce
ment that character, qualities of leadership, and physical vigor are to be
considered in passing on applicants means anything, this type of student
should be able to enter Stanford. »
Alumni organizations are already endorsing the regional scholar
ship plan. A group of Stanford men in New York City have just an
nounced a scholarship of $500 to send a New York man to Stanford
next year. The same association made clear its intention of financing an
additional scholarship immediately in order to send two men instead of
one. Oakland alumni last night appointed a committee to determine the
best means of providing a scholarship. With other graduate organiza
tions favoring'the plan, the freshman class next year should include not
only many men who otherwise could not pay tuition, but also a goodly
number of desirable students who would never have been financially able
to attend Stanford, tuition or no tuition.
