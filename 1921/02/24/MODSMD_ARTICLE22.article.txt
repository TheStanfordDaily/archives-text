# LIFE OF DR. GARDNER DEVOTED TO HUMANITY
## 
### 
One of the leading figures on the
campus who upholds the ideals of the
Stanford Spirit is found in Dr. Charles
Gardner, chaplain in the Stanford Me
morial Church. As a comrade to all
whom be meets, his aim has been to
penetrate into the heart of the student
body and develop a type of manhood
and womanhood of which Stanford may
be proud.
Dr. Gardner, who is of English par
entage, came to California in 1893, and
after reading theology with Bishop
Nichols at the Church Divinity School of
the Pacific for live years was ordained
in the ministry. He became rector of
All Saints' Church, Palo Alto, in 1898,
and came to Stanford as the lirst chap
lain of the University in 1902. He
preached one of the dedication sermons
at the opening of the Memorial Church
in 1903. In 1917 the chaplain went East
and was special preacher at Harvard
University. The degree of Doctor of
Divinity was granted him in 1920.
Dr. Gardner has done much to further
social service work in California. In
1907 he founded the Social Service
Board of Stanford and four years later
the Stanford Clinics Auxiliary in San
Francisco, which led to the establish
ment of the Campus Auxiliary to the
Stanford Clinic. He is the president of
the Board of Directors of the Stanford
Home for Convalescent Children. At
the time the Red Cross needed capable
men to carry out its important mission

of relief, Dr. Gardner was made chair
man of the Home Service Section of the
Palo Alto American Red Cross. During
the period of the war he had charge of
the organization of church work in Cali Â«
fornia for Herbert Hoover and was
chaplain of the Officers' Training Camp
in Del Monte. He is a trustee of the
Church Divinity School of the Pacific
and was for many years dean of the
Convocation of San Jose of the Diocese
of California.
In working out the policy of the Uni
versity Church, Dr. Gardner regards it
not as an institution but as an influence.
It does not provide for secular member
ship, but throws the "doors so wide open
that all may enter, and with a platform
so broad that all can find expression for
their religious life." To carry out this
policy In- has adopted the system of spe
cial preachers, which permits the church
to engage the services of the most in
fluential representatives of all sects from
every part of the country to occupy the
pulpit. The interpretation of the great
oratorios, under the direction of War
ren D. Allen, which were introduced
by Dr. Gardner, has made the service
unique and lias addec( much to the
artistic life of the University.
The chaplain may be seen any bright
Saturday afternoon wielding the "club"
with the other golf fans on the links of
a nearby country club. "My cure for the
blues," he says, "is visiting the sick and
afflicted, not seeing the movies which I
abominate!"
