# CABBAGES AND THINGS T. I., '23

### 
"Here's room for improvement," re
marked the butler, as he surveyed the :
parlor the morning after the night |
before.
* * *
One of our worthy militants wants 1
to borrow enough ffioney to build a|
more substantial navy. That's what!
we might call, "floating a loan."
* * *
Even the Idaho senate has passed a
bill prohibiting the sale of cigarettes
in the Gem state. Ye Cabbage ed.
owes one of the representatives a ten
spot. Better he look a little out.
* * *
Talking about the blade of grass j
that pulverizes the dromedary's spinal
column, a robber in Memphis held up |
a former victim at the point of a gjun :
and forced him to take back his empty;
pocketbook. The only thing worse
that we can think of would be to force!
a minister to listen to a dictophone
reproduction of his own sermon.
* * *
Reformers' ideas are like their
heads —nothing in 'em.
* * *
Cowboy—-We used to buy a bridle
with two bits.
Harness salesman —That's all right.;
We'll let you have one on time with ;
only one bit.
* * *
The best debasing team on the cam
pus is comprised of those two Yellow
Peril motormen who stop and argue
about turning the switch. They've
certainly got the low-down on extem
pore argument.
* * *
These birds who always knock exes j
for a loop aren't so far off. You know j
the general shape of a 100p —a linej
with the ends connected.
