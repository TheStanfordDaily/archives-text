OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, CORVALLIS, Feb. 24.—The
highest voltage 60-cycle electrical trans
fortner on the Pacific Coast is in opera
tion in the laboratory of the Electrical
Engineering department of the Oregon
Agricultural College. It lias a capacity
of 350,000 volts and is susetl in experi
ments by the students for determining
the break-down point of porcelain and
other insulators for high tension work
and also for testing all kinds of elec
trical insulations.
The installation of this "cute little
toy —it weighs 15.000 pounds and com
pares favorably in size with a large hank
safe—has just been completed by Pro
fessor I'red (). McMillan and his assist
ants, and the professor is as proud of
his "pet" as a fond parent is of his only
son. Situated as it is in a concrete pit
and surrounded by a strong fence, the
inquisitive visitor is restrained from try
ing to find out how much of its capacity
he can safely absorb.
