# RENAISSANCE CLOD TO PRESENT PLAYS
## Spanish Comedies Translated Into English for Saturday Evening Production of Club 
### 
Four unique comedies of the six
teenth century life of Spain will be
presented in the Little Theater, Sat
urday evening by the Renaissance
Club. The program will start at 8
o'clock.
Translated for the first time
the Spanish of Lope de Rueda for the
special use of the club in staging the
plays, the comedies are fresh and full
of humorous lines. They will be pre
sented with strict fidelity to historical
detail. The rich costumes of mediev
al Spain will be emphasized by the
simple stage setting used.
The account given by Cervantes*of
the performance of a gfoup of play
ers in a. city square is the basis for
much of the detail employed in the
Saturday productions. The curtain
will rise to discover a group of villag
ers celebrating a feast day. The com
pany of seven players arrive, set up
a crude wooden stage, and perform
four short comedies amid the applause
and comment of the villagers.
