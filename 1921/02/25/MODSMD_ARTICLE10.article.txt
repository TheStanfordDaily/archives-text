# CARDINAL SQUAD READY FOR BRUIN CURT TEAM
## Blue and Gold to Meet Local Five In Second Contest of Series in Encina Gym Tomorrow Night 
### 
With the first of the Stanford-California basketball series already
stowed away, the Blue and Gold aggregation will have the advantage over
the Cardinal quintet, when the game starts tomorrow night on the En
cina court. Whether this advantage will have any bearing on the re
sults of the contest we have yet to learn, but Coach Powell and his men
believe they can put up their best game. The varsity has had a short
rest since the return from the northern trip, and are in best shape to give
the bruin five their hardest fight of the season.
Several of the squad showed signs of being stale after the long ride
from Seattle but short workouts during the last few afternoons of this
week has removed all traces of this fault. Coach Powell has been devot-

ing a great deal of practice time to
the perfecting of a defense for the
California style of play and the Blue
and Gold will probably find themselves
up against a, tougher proposition than
they met a couple of weeks ago 011
the Berkeley court.
Davies and Righter will probably
start the game at the forward posi
tions for the Cfardinal, while Coop
or either" Douhit or Captain Symes
will open the fight for California.
Symes was not used much by Coach
Wight in the first game but as he was
one of their biggest scoring factors
against Oregon and O. A. C., he may
be used most of the game. The Blue
and Gold have a good man in Douhit
as a reserve and with Coop, he aided
greatly in California's defeating of
Stanford in the first game.
Mills will be found at his usual po
sition of center at the opening of the
game tomorrow night and facing him
for California will be Larkey. Mills
w&s a little off form in the first game
but a good rest has worked wonders
and Bert is expected to be a tower
of offense for the Cardinal.
Captain Freddie Adams and Dick
Richmond will §tart at their regular
guard LeHane and Eg
gleston wilwpfe ahe bulk of the defense
for the Gold. LeHane is
is short b'iij liafc proved to be good
both on defcaßtß and offense. Eggles
ton. last yearfc selection for the all
conference teim; is nited one of the
best guards tin the Coast this year,
and will a man who will need
watching in tlie game tomorrow.
The seat ?ale will start at 6:30
o'clock tomorrow night and with the
I exception of the California seats, the
women's section at the east end of
; the court will be the only other re
i served section. Holders of student
| body cards and season tickets will be
| charged 35 cents admission, while all
j others will be taxed 75 cents. Eddie
Penaluna, of San Francisco has been
! secured to referee the game.
