# PHI DELTA THETA CLINCHES POSITION BY MEDIC VICTORY
## 
### 
The Phi Delta Theta quintet clinch
ed second place in the intramural
basketball league yesterday by defeat
ing the Medics 12 to 9.
The Medics were greatly handicap
ped by the loss of G. D. Brown, their
stellar forward. Brown was kept out
of the game on account of illness.
The Phi Delta Thetas started out
fast, and the first part of the game
looked like a runaway. Then the
Medics pulled themselves together and
by hard fighting pressed the Phi Delts
close, but were unable to take the
lead at any stage of the game.
At. the end of the first half the score
stood 7 to 3 against the Medics. They
came back strong in the second peri
od, and for a time it looked as if they
would overcome the Phi Delt's lead.
Pigott always managed to get the ball
just about when the Medics seemed
ready to pass the Phi Delts, and by
his sure shooting kept the score in
favor of the fraternity team.
Baker, Weaver, Sommerfield, Love
and Burkhart played for the Medics.
Pigott, Pleyter, Fletcher, Aubert,
Miller and Kraft went in for the Phi
Delta Thetas.
The Alpha Delta Phis are still lead
ing the league, and undoubtedly will
come out of the series champions of
the campus. The Alpha Delt - Chi Psi
game which was to come off yesterday
was set back a day on account of
varsity practice.
