# WITH THE VARSITY
## 
### 
The Stanford basketball Varsity last week at Washington lost to a
wonderful team on its own court at the end of a liard trip. Previously
the team at California was somewhat handicapped by the early week
Washington games here. Tomorrow the Varsity meets tho Californians
on Encina Court. The men have had time for a slight rest, and are in
fairly good shape, and now must either win from the conference leaders
or concede them the unclouded coast supremacy.
Coach Powell has as husky and as brilliant a combination as ever
represented Stanford in a major sport, and his team will exhibit the
type of game we. expect of it, win or lose.
It remains for the Stanford rooters, those of us who are fortunate
enough to gain admittance, to represent the Cardinal on the sidelines
as the team will on the court. There should be nothing in the evening's
program that will not check with the Stanford idea of sportsmanship
and courtesy. Veil Chief Kinney and his assistants will be in charge
of the crowd, and if the rooters will follow their'leadership there will
be nothing about the evening that Stanford students will be unable to
look upon with pride and satisfaction, for the team itself will be there
to battle with all its fight and spirit.
