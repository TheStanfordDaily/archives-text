The senior class has come up notice
ably in passing and general teamwork.
Caryl Elsey 'has especially developed in
her ability to throw baskets. The sopho
mores were handicapped by the absence
of Esther Culver in center, but other
wise played with their regular lineup.
At the end of the first half of the
junior-freshman game the score stood
9 to 4 in favor of the freshmen. The
passing of the juniors was wild and
seemed disrupted by the teamwork of
the lowerclass team. In the second half
the juniors were better able to get away
from their guards and as a result rapidly
brought the score to a tie of 9 to 9
Merian McElligott broke the tiuJji favor
of the freshmen. About two minutes
later "the juniors again tied the score,
which was broken by a field throw by
Imogene Aten in their favor. Three
more baskets for the juniors brought
the final count 17 to 11 in their favor.
