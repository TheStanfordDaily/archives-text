# ROTH SUPERVISES TRUST AND UNIVERSITY PLANT
## 
### 
Almou E. Roth occupies a unique
position in the life of the Stanford
community. To the usual student
mind in any college, the Business Of
fice stands as a department outside
the scope of undergraduate interest.
It looms as an impersonal entity, ne
cessary to conduct business routine
but rarely compelling attention.
Assuming the office of Comptroller
of Stanford in the autumn of 1919, Al
mon Roth has by the force of person
ality humanized the department. The
Stanford Business Office is marked
by a desire and ability not only to ef
ficiently administrate the University
Trust, but to conduct the minor phases
of its work in a way that adds to the
personal convenience of the students.
Instances readily come to the mind
of every student of Comptroller Roth's
services in building walks, shifting
buildings, or grading lots, which,
though not in themselves important,
reveal his constant watchfulness of
the University plant and grounds and
his efficiency in promptly remedying
faults.
Though he was born in South Da
kota, August 31, 1886, California can
claim him as a thoroughly naturalized
native son, for his parents moved to
this state when he was three years
old. Spending his boyhood in Mendo
cino County, he received his element
ary schooling in Ukiah and graduated
from the high school of that city in
1905.
The following year Roth entered
Stanford, majoring in the Pre-Legal
department. His career in the Uni
versity is reassuring to students who
endeavor to evade "smoke-ups" while
they are immersed in student act
ivities. The friends of Roth some
times jokingly said that he majored
in politics and athletics. Neverthe
less, % his record in the Law depart
ment was above the average. He re
ceived his A. B. sheepskin in 1909. and
a Juris Doctor degree two years later.
Reversing the usual procedure by
which athletes seek political prefer
ence after establishing a reputation
on the athletic field, Roth was active
in student organizations during the
earlier years of his college course and
was not able to enter athletics until
his senior year* The present Men's
Council for Student Control had its
parallel at that time in the Executive
Committee of the Men's Conference,
which he served as president. His
organizing ability was recognized by

the student body when it selected him
as president of the Associated Stu
dents in his senior year.
The entrance of Roth into athletics
late in his college course seemingly
was no handicap to him, for as a seni
or he made both the varsity track and
football squads. The time of the five
man relay team of which he was a
member still stands as the official
record of the Pacific Coast. The year
following his graduation he was se
lected as a member of the All-Amer
ican Rugby team to tour the Anti
podes. The fifteen, composed of rugby
players from California and Nevada,
played the crack teams of Australia
and New Zealand and returned to the
mainland with the long end of the
score in many of its gridiron battles.
During his undergraduate years he
balanced his studies not only by par
ticipation in activities but by outside
work, as a member of the fire depart
ment of the campus and as a waiter
at Madrona. The old fire force of that
period was made historic by its ath
letic personnel. During his four years
connection with the force, the records
reveal that but one fire diverted the
attention of the student firemen from
athletics. It is likewise related that
on that disconcerting occasion, five
of the six men were at a track meet !
at Berkeley. Shortly afterwards a
permanent personnel was substituted
for the students.
In 1909 the office of Student Advisor
w*as created, Roth being appointed as '
the first occupant of the position which
has been only lately abolished because j
it duplicated the work of the Dean!
of Men. He remained advisor until!
1912. Phi Delta Phi, Quadrangle Club,'
Skull and Snakes, and Encina Club,
claim him as a member.
For two years after he left Stanford, i
1912-1914. he practiced law in /the of-'
fice of the District Attorney of San
Francisco. Entering the office of
Pillsbury, Madison, and Sutro, in the
latter year, he remained with the J
firm until returning to the campus last
year.
His work was in the business phase j
of law, in the main consisting of the |
reorganization and financing of corpo
rations.
In 1912 he married Mildred Hayes, j
'11, of San Jose. Mrs. Roth is a mem
ber of Gamma Phi Beta, Cap and |
Gown, and during her undergraduate i
years was Associate Editor of the j
Daily Palo Alto.

connection with the force, the records
reveal that but one fire diverted the
attention of the student firemen from
athletics. It is likewise related that
on that disconcerting occasion, five
of the six men were at a track meet !
at Berkeley. Shortly afterwards a
permanent personnel was substituted
for the students.
In 1909 the office of Student Advisor
w*as created, Roth being appointed as '
the first occupant of the position which
has been only lately abolished because j
it duplicated the work of the Dean!
of Men. He remained advisor until!
1912. Phi Delta Phi, Quadrangle Club,'
Skull and Snakes, and Encina Club,
claim him as a member.
For two years after he left Stanford, i
1912-1914. he practiced law in /the of-'
fice of the District Attorney of San
Francisco. Entering the office of
Pillsbury, Madison, and Sutro, in the
latter year, he remained with the J
firm until returning to the campus last
year.
His work was in the business phase j
of law, in the main consisting of the |
reorganization and financing of corpo
rations.
In 1912 he married Mildred Hayes, j
'11, of San Jose. Mrs. Roth is a mem
ber of Gamma Phi Beta, Cap and |
Gown, and during her undergraduate i
years was Associate Editor of the j
Daily Palo Alto.
Almou E. Roth occupies a unique
position in the life of the Stanford
community. To the usual student
mind in any college, the Business Of
fice stands as a department outside
the scope of undergraduate interest.
It looms as an impersonal entity, ne
cessary to conduct business routine
but rarely compelling attention.
Assuming the office of Comptroller
of Stanford in the autumn of 1919, Al
mon Roth has by the force of person
ality humanized the department. The
Stanford Business Office is marked
by a desire and ability not only to ef
ficiently administrate the University
Trust, but to conduct the minor phases
of its work in a way that adds to the
personal convenience of the students.
Instances readily come to the mind
of every student of Comptroller Roth's
services in building walks, shifting
buildings, or grading lots, which,
though not in themselves important,
reveal his constant watchfulness of
the University plant and grounds and
his efficiency in promptly remedying
faults.
Though he was born in South Da
kota, August 31, 1886, California can
claim him as a thoroughly naturalized
native son, for his parents moved to
this state when he was three years
old. Spending his boyhood in Mendo
cino County, he received his element
ary schooling in Ukiah and graduated
from the high school of that city in
1905.
The following year Roth entered
Stanford, majoring in the Pre-Legal
department. His career in the Uni
versity is reassuring to students who
endeavor to evade "smoke-ups" while
they are immersed in student act
ivities. The friends of Roth some
times jokingly said that he majored
in politics and athletics. Neverthe
less, % his record in the Law depart
ment was above the average. He re
ceived his A. B. sheepskin in 1909. and
a Juris Doctor degree two years later.
Reversing the usual procedure by
which athletes seek political prefer
ence after establishing a reputation
on the athletic field, Roth was active
in student organizations during the
earlier years of his college course and
was not able to enter athletics until
his senior year* The present Men's
Council for Student Control had its
parallel at that time in the Executive
Committee of the Men's Conference,
which he served as president. His
organizing ability was recognized by

the student body when it selected him
as president of the Associated Stu
dents in his senior year.
The entrance of Roth into athletics
late in his college course seemingly
was no handicap to him, for as a seni
or he made both the varsity track and
football squads. The time of the five
man relay team of which he was a
member still stands as the official
record of the Pacific Coast. The year
following his graduation he was se
lected as a member of the All-Amer
ican Rugby team to tour the Anti
podes. The fifteen, composed of rugby
players from California and Nevada,
played the crack teams of Australia
and New Zealand and returned to the
mainland with the long end of the
score in many of its gridiron battles.
During his undergraduate years he
balanced his studies not only by par
ticipation in activities but by outside
work, as a member of the fire depart
ment of the campus and as a waiter
at Madrona. The old fire force of that
period was made historic by its ath
letic personnel. During his four years

reveal that but one fire diverted the
attention of the student firemen from
athletics. It is likewise related that
