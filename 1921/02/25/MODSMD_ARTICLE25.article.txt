Dear Sir 1 w i>h. through the columns

music-lovers in the University to attend
the concert to be given by Paul Alt house
in the Assembly Hall tomorrow ( Satnr
day) evening. Mr. Althouse is one of
the really big singers at the Metropolitan
opera. On account of the heroic and
beautiful qualities of his voice and his
power as a dramatic singer, in- is ac
claimed by many as the logical successor
of Caruso. T do not often make an ap
peal of this sort, but feel justified this
time in urging all members of the Uni
versity community to make a special
effort to hear this great artist.
