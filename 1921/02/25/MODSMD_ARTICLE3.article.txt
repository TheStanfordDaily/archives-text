# VARSITY-FRESHMAN TRACK MEET COMES TOMORROW AT 10:30
## 
### 
Tomorrow the varsity and freshmen
meet in the tliird of the interteam track
struggles. Additions to both squads have
materially strengthened the teams and
sonic real meet-winning time will prob
ably be made on the cinders tomorrow.
"Dink" Tenipleton has some real
"finds" out for the track events now
among the new men. None of the times
are available due to the censorship on the
oval, but judging from the way some
of the youngsters are making the old
boys step out, there is going to be some
keen competition for firsts and also a few
of the "second and third place men,"
that are needed to round out a squad of
point-winners.
Art Wilcox is back on the pole vault
this year with a better form than before
and going stronger every day. Last night
in practice he cleared the bar at not so
very far short of four meters. This is
going some in the face of the fact that
the dual meet last year went at a figure
representing just about his height.
