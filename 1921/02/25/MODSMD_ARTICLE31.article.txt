# BUDGET FUND DRIVE OF Y..C.W A. 10 BE HELD THE DAYS NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The Y. W. C. A. drive for $60(1, to
help carry on the work for the coming
year, will be held on March 2, 3 and 4.
This sum, which is about one-quarter of
the entire budget for the local chapter,
will be collected in a house to house
canvass.
The funds subscribed to the Y. W. arc
used in three different ways: first, to
alleviate the expenses incurred by direct
participation in campus activities and
management of campus affairs under the
Supervision of the Y. W. C. A.; second,
to carry on work in Palo Alto and vicin
ity ; and third, for expenditures required
by the national organization.
The chapter maintains a general secre
tary on the campus, whose salary is,
raised by an advisory board entirely in
dependent of campus support. Her du
ties include general supervision of the
Y W. affairs on the campus.
Discussion groups on current topics
are conducted under the supervision of
well-known people. Publicity for the
annual vocational conference, which was
held here last Saturday, is handled by
the organization. Bimonthly meetings,
at which there is usually some promi
nent speaker, are also held.
The Y. W. also does much to bring the
women of the campus into closer rela
tionship' with one another. This is
usually accomplished through picnics,
meetings, committees, and get-together
parties.
These are but a few of the many ways
in which the money subscribed is used
on the campus.
