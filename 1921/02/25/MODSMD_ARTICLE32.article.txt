# FROSH DIAMOND SQUAD ROUNDING INTO SHAPE
## Newland Says Babes Have Good Material; Wants a Larger Number at Tryout 
### 
Freshman baseball is getting under
way as intensive practice has started,
and although working under diffi
culties, the freshmen yire presenting
a fair appearance. "Bud" Woodward
has been elected captain of the team,
and has charge of the squad in the
absence of a regular coach.
Harvey Newlands, firmer varsity
player, coached the freshmen |or a
time at the beginning, but dropped
the work a short time ago, leaving the
'24 players without a coach. Varsity
Coach Seay has been giving what time
he can spare toward supervising
freshman practice.
Approximately thirty-five freshmen
ar« out for practice. This number will
be reduced considerably when the first
cut takes place in a few days. Those
who have not yet been out must be
on hand before the end of this week
if they expectj to have any chance to
place on the squad. Practice is be
ing held every afternoon at 4, the
freshman diamond.
Hitters are lacking, and any one
who can wield the willow with telling
effect is sure of receiving good atten
tion. ""Pitchers are also greatly need
ed, and any future Mathewsons who
are lurking on the outskirts need only
step up and show their goods to be
certain of a good chance. The in
field is rounding out in better shape
than the other departments, but early
season practice shows plenty of room
for improvement. The outfield must
be strengthened much before it can
:iold its own with the inner garden
combination. On the whole, the great
est need seems to be for good hitters
and good pitchers.
The first game on the schedule is
with San Jose High School on March
5, but it is expected that another
will be arranged for before that
time. There has also been some talk
about. a trip to be taken during the
Easter holidays, although plans have
as yet taken no definite shape.
Renovation of the freshman field is
being finished, and with its comple
tion, a good diamond will be avail
able for practice. Regrading and put
ting in new bases are the chief im
provements being made.
