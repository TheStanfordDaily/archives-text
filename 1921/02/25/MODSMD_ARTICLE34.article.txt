"The Wind-up of the Basketball
Season," is the title of Harry Borba's
sport story which will appear in the
coming Pictorial. Borba discusses,
the results of the past season and j
gives his opinion on the possibility of,
whipping California in the two games [
which remain to be played. The ar- j
tide has the news about what hap
pened up north and what the plan is
for remedying the difficulty.
Warren J. Lewis, '20, has written an !
article callcd "The Eating Situation,"
considering the progress made by the
recent drive for lower prices towards
the accomplishment of its end. Lewis
says that the manager plan is ineffici
ent, considered from the standpoint
of cheap buying, and that a new sys
tem of purchasing should be arranged
whereby the smallness of the items
and the distraction of other work than
buying in the dase of the purchaser, j
might be eliminated.
An article on the old controversy
concerning sophomore caps is the con
tribution of Tom Irwin, '23. What
difference does it make whether they
wear the old red crush, or the flashy!
check? They'll wear what they please
at any event.
The book will be on sale Tuesday
morning.
