a few practice innings last night to
strengthen the base-running and give
the men a chance to get their eyes 011
the ball.
There were few strikeouts, as the
pitchers were warned to "go easy on
that arm," and the boys sent the fielders
on both sides scampering to the jungles,
with the result of a lot of valuable prac
tice in base-running and throwing.
