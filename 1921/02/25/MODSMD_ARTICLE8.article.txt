Summer schools for the civic-com
mercial organization secretaries and
others interested in civic fields have
been held under the auspices of the
American City Bureau for the past
six years. Last year the school was
held at the University of Wisconsin,
but so much time was consumed in
making the trip that many members
were unable to attend. Stanford was
chosen as the most central point in
the West for the meeting.
