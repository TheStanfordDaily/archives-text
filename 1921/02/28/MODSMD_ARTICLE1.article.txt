# STANFORD CHOSEN AS SITE FOR FOOD RESEARCH SCHOOL
## $700,000 Fund Provided by Carnegie Corporation For Institute 
### 
Establishment of a food institute at
Stanford for the intensive study of
problems of production, distribution,
and consumption of food was agreed
upon by the Carnegie Corporation of
New York last Saturday, according to
an announcement by that organization
yesterday. The new organization will
begin work in July, 1922. A fund of
$700,000 will be provided for the sup
port of the school for ten years.
The selection of Stanford as the home
of the institute was due in part to the
fact that the best available collection of
documentary material relative to the
economic side of the war is shelved in
the Stanford Library. The material was
collected by Herbert Hoover, who first
suggested the need for the institute to
the Carnegie Corporation.
Research work during the war, when
the study of food supply in its different
phases was necessary in order to obtain
maximum efficiency in the nutrition of
nations involved, emphasizes the need
for such an institute, according to the

founding corporation. The general field
of the institute will be tlie problems
arising after the food has left the
farmer's hands.
Scientific stifdy of the marketing and
distribution of food products will be
one of the special features of the re
search school. Us objects, however, are
intended to contribute to the welfare of
the producer and consumer by eliminat
ing present wastes in the marketing of
nearly all kinds of food. Inaccurracy of
previous data has shown a national need
which the institute is intended to elim
inate.
Three scientists, to be known as di
rectors of the Food Research Institute
of Stanford University, having the au
thority to determine the scientific poli
cies and problems to lie studied," are to
be appointed by the University, in ac
cordance with an agreement between
Stanford authorities and the Carnegie
Corporation. The founding corporation
has voiced its desire that the new organ
ization be known eventually as the
Hoover Institute. Further agreements
provide for the appointment of men of
national prominence, representing vari
ous groups of the community, one of
them to be Herbert Hoover, to an ad
visory committee comprising nine mem
bers.
Provision lias also been made for the
admittance of specially qualified stu
dents, as it may be possible to instruct
them without disadvantage to the pri
mary research purposes of the >rganiza
tion. A limited group of fellowships
will be available for graduate students
of more than ordinary ability. It is ex
pected that they will receive valuable
training in public service and at the
same time carry out the objects of the
institute.
