# VARSITY QUINTET STAGES COME-BACK AND DOWNS CALIFORNIA SCORE 30-25
## VICTORY GIVES CARDINAL CHANCE FOR TITLE; 135 POUND TEAM ALSO WINS 
### 
Stanford evened up the basketball
series with the University of Califor
nia by defeating th% Bruin aggrega
tion in the second game on Encina
Court, Saturday evening. The score
was 30 to 25. The game in many
respects was like the first one played
in Berkeley two weeks ago. Then
California took the 30 points while
Stanford was on the short end with
24. As in the opener the winning
team jumped right into the lead and
maintained a three or four point mar
gin throughout th«< game.
Powell's men scored first when
Davies converted a free" throw. Im
mediately thereafter Jimmy started
on his mad career and throughout
this period he kept the spectators
thrilled with long and short difficult
shots. He seemed to experience very
little trouble in making them from
any angle.
Meanwhile the Cardinal quintet was
putting on a clever exhibition of de

fensive play. Captain Adams was
right on the job under the basket,
and Coop, who played behind Freddy
in the game across the bay, found he
up against a different sort of propo
sition. Coop's team-mates were sel
dom able to get the ball to a posi
tion where they could pass it to him,
and when they did Adams usually in
terfered so that he spent an restless
and uneventful evening.
Stanford scored five points before
the visitors got started. Then they
chalked up a field goal and Stanford
added two more points. So it went
with each team giving its best but
the Cardinal always a little in the
lead. The Bruins were plainly dis
tressed at their inability to get loose
and score a few points. They held
frequent floor-rapping sessions in the
center of the court where on hands
and knees they put on table-rapping
seances, minus the table, but they
couldn't seem to get the right kind
of spirits to work with them. Many
others are experiencing this same
kind of trouble these days.
The score at half time was 19 to
12 in favor of Stanford. With this
comfortable lead to go on the red
jerseyed players took things easy in
eleven more markers while their op
the last period being content with
ponents made thirteen.
Jimmy Davies was the scoring star
of the game. He made one more thun
half of the total Stanford score,
dropping six through the hoop while
under fire and making four free
throws for a total of sixteen points.
His work on the defense was just as
effective and he was accorded a great
hand when he left the game near the
end.
Coach Powell's men played one of
their moKt perfect games last night.
They worked with machine-like pre
cision and very little lost motion.
They settled right down to play bask
etball at the outset and they kept up
a consistent gait during the entire en
counter.
Captain Jack Symes was the high
man on California's scoring. He made
three field goals and three free ones
for a total of nine points.
There was a mammoth crowd on
hand to see the two teams go through
their paces. There was several hun
dred in line when the doors were
opened at 6:30 and 7 o'clock every
available seat and piece of standing
room had been taken.
The place of the third game of the
series has not been decided upon.
Graduate Manager Ed Martin is go
ing to make an effort to have it staged
in San Francisco in the Civic Audi
torium. If this location cannot be ob
tained it is very likely that the Oak
land auditorium will be used.
