# STANFORD LIGHT-WEIGHTS DEFEAT BRUIN LIMITEDS
## 
### 
Speed, science and sure shooting
won the game for the Stanford 135-
| pound quintet Saturday night when
the weight men buried the Blue and
Gold midgets under a 31-11 score.
The contest was an easy victory for
j the Cardinal menyWho staged one of
| the fastest exhibitions of basket
shfioting ever seen on Encina Court,
despite the strong defense put up by
the thans-bay artists.
Koba, the diminutive Cardinal for
j ward, was the sensation of the even
ing. The way he deceived his guards
time after time convulsed more than
a thousand Stanford rooters with
; laughter. He was incredibly fast on
1 the defense, and slippery as the pro
verbial greased pig when he had the
! ball.
I
Captain Young, flaying running
guard, was high point-winner for the
( Stanford midgets. He scored six
points in the first half and seven in
I the second period. His fast dribbling
and passing was one of the chief fea
tures of the weight team's offense,
and his precision in dropping the ball
through the hoop was fatal to the
hopes of the Campanile'contingent.
Hogle at Center and Hollingswortli
at forward worked well in the midgets'
system of team work. Hogle shot
four field goals. Silveira played a
. steady defensive game at standing
guard, and his interference with the
: California offensjve is largely respons
ible for the small count run up by the
Berkelyyites.
Kennedy and Polesky substituted for
Hollingswortli and Young in the sec
ond half. Brazil went in for Kenne
dy in the last few minutes. The sec
|oiul string men kept up the same bril
liant play shown by the regulars, and
kept the Bruins from scoring, though
they were unable to add to the lead
already gained.
Playing was close during the first
few minutes. Stanford gained a slight
lead at the outset, but the Bears press
ed thorn close. When tlie first period
was about half gone the Cardinal men
suddenly started a dazzling attack
that swept the Cubs off their feet and
piled up points fast enough to suit
even the voracious Stanford rooters.
The half ended 14 to 7.
The second half was even more of
a massacre than the preceding period.
The Bears only scored 4 points in
this period, while the Stanford five
piled lip 17, making the final score
31 to 11.
Johnson, the chunky California for
ward, was the strongest man on the
Blue and Gold aggregation. He
scored 7 points, though out of the
game during part of the second half.
Weinstein, at running guard, played
a fast game, but had trouble finding
the basket.
Shooting was the weak points of the
California team. Getting nearly as
many tries at the hoop as the Stan
ford men, htey missed a much larger
percentage of throws.
The following gives the line-ups of
the two teams:
Stanford—• Koba, Hollingsworth,
forwards; Hogle, center; Young* run
ning guard; Silveira, standing guard.
California—Johnson and Degolia,
forwards; Beach, center; Weinstein,
running guard; Thompson, standing
guard.
Substitutes — Stanford — Polesky,
Kennedy, Brazil.
California —Griffith, Henney, Sulli
van, Taylor and White.
