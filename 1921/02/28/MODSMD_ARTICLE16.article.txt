# A 						STEP AHEAD FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
The first eastern recognition of the Pacific Coast as an intellectual
center comes with the announcement of the $700,000 appropriation by
the Carnegie Corporation of New York for the establishing of a food
institute at Stanford. It is, of course, a mark of distinction that this
University should be recognized as the best fitted to undertake the work.
To Stanford students the announcement bears other marks of signifi
cance. The value of the Stanford Library is emphasized. Heretofore
there has never been available any comprehensive data on food produc
tion, distribution and consumption. The Hoover workers have had
access to sources never reached by other research workers, and the re
sultant collection of documentary material now in the Library can prob
ably never be duplicated.
The action of the Carnegie Corporation designates Stanford as
a University needing of and worthy of public support. Valuable
financial gifts have previously been made by such men as Treasurer Hop
kins of the University, and Thomas Welton Stanford, but these were by
men connected with the Stanford family. The Carnegie action provides
the first financial support the University has received from the outside,
and should do more than a little in placing Stanford before the public as
it must be placed if it is to be a greater University in the future.
