# COAST SUPREMACY
## 
### 
The Pacific Coast basketball supremacy is at present wandering at
large. The Washington University Daily announced that the northern
five was the best on the coast when it recorded the 17-16 victory over
the Cardinal. Washington has dropped four conference games.
Coach Powell's men handily took honors from California Saturday
night, and have an even chance of repeating this week, though the com
ing game will in any event be a tough battle.
A victory by Stanford in the last game would on a percentage basis
tie Stanford with California for the conference title. The conference it
self has never made a ruling in regard to the three-game series, though
all contests of two-game and four-game series are regularly figured in.
The California Nevada League authorities on the point formerly ruled
that the California-Stanford series should count as one game, the win
ner to be credited in the percentage column with one victory, and the
loser with one lost game.
