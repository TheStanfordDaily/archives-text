# LOCAL STICKERS SLAM LEGION FOR 17 RUNS
## Draper, Kelly, and Green on Mound for the Cardinals; Batting of Nine is Good 
### 
A fair-sized crowd of Cardinal fans
saw the first baseball game of the season
last Saturday afternoon on the local
diamond when the varsity won a lop
sided contest from the American Legion
team of Golden Gate Post No. 40 with a
final score of 17 to 3.
Coach Seay's men maintained the lead
throughout the game and banged out
nine hits, while our slabsters held the
visitors down to six. Draper was on the
mound for the first three innings and
the Legionnaires succeeded in tallying
only two runs while our men were cir
cling the bags for five. Kelly went in
in the fourth and put so much stuff on
the apple that he finished his three
innings with a clean sheet, no hits, no
runs.
Green finished the game and only one
man crossed the rubber while he was
on the slab. Captain "Doug" Bundy
held down the other end of the battery.
Mitchell and Kline were the stars with
the fungo, each getting two hits to their
credit. When Mitchell pulled up at third
after one of his wallops he had driven a
low fly to deep center which had good
speed on the bound and sent the fielder
scurrying to the long grass.
Patterson handled his job at first with
the form and carriage of a veteran.
"Pat" gets them high or low and he is
no slouch with the stick, either. At the
opposite corner of the infield Tlecken
dorf let nothing get by and his throw
ing was sure and fast. Kallatn worked
at short during the first part of the game
and changed to second to replace Mitch
ell, Maillot going in at short. Kallam's
fielding was in the A-l class and he
drove out a hit which started his batting
average off in good shape.
Carver and Wayland each played a
good brand of ball, covering ground
well in the field and meeting the ball
several times with the stick. In the sixth
inning Crowe replaced Wayland in cen
ter and drove a clean hit through the
open territory at second with the same
well-aimed swing which piled up his bat
ting average last year.
Lilly and Mertz, Stanford men, played
with the Legion team, and Lilly's work
was of the same quality which has
marked him as one of the best ballplayers
Stanford has ever produced. Mertz
worked as catcher, and, although his
throwing is a little wild, will Ik- the
strongest contender with Captain Bundy
if Green continues as a slabster. Cowan,
second baseman and captain of tlie vis
itors, is an old Stanford man, and was
one of the best shqrtstops that a Car
dinal nine ever had.
