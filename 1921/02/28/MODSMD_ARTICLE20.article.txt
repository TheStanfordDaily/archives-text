# AL THOUSE CONCERT IS ONE OF SEASON'S BEST
## Program Varied in Types of Songs Furnishes Chance For.. Artist's.. Versatility 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
It was a most fortunate circum
stance that Paul Althouse could ar
range a Stanford recital, and the some-1
what impromptu program which he
gave in the Assembly Hall Saturday
evening proved one of the most
thoroughly satisfying and enjoyable
of the season's concerts.
Mr. Althouse fulfilled all that has
been said of him throughout his re
cent tour by critics who have placed
him among our few great tenors, even
heralding him as the forthcoming
Caruso. His voice is one which may
truly be called beautiful. It is full [
and rich, wide and even in range,
capable of delicate shadings and im
pressing crescendos. His phrasing is
remarkably controlled and his diction
perfect; every word can be understood
and yet there is no feeling of any
effort in his pronunciation.
The artist chose as his first group
of songs a number of French and
Italian selections, Massenet's "Le Sais
Tu" and Manoir de Rosamonde," by i
Duparc, being particularly interesting.
Verdi's "Celeste Aida," aria from
"Aida," was the favorite of the more
substantial numbers and was sung
with sympathetic warmth and peauty
of tone. The "Aida" number, to
gether with "La Donne Est Mobile,"
from "Rigoletto," which was sung as
a final encore were the only really
classical numbers of the evening. The
program was similar in this respect j
to those of several recent concerts in
that it did not seem to contain
enough of those compositions by old
masters which every audience loves
aird likes to hear sung by some one
who it knows is capable of interpret-1
ing them satisfyingly.
Among the other groups were a I
"May Day Carol." and "Someone
Worth While," two very pleasing
numbers, and "the Blind Plowman,"!
which emphasized the powers of the
artist's voice and his command of
every resource. Of the last group.
Russel's "Vale" and "The Living God"
were the most appealing.
Mr. Althouse was accompanied by
Rudolph Gruen, who besides has care
ful and finished accompaniments play
ed three solo selections, Chopin'sj
"Ballade in G minor," Rubenstein's
"Valse Caprice." aad a "Juba Dance"
by Dett, in which he proved himself
an artist of skill and feeling.
