# "Borrowed" Syncopation, Moon, and Bandstand Requisites For Dance
## 
### 
At least one campus couple has found
a solution to the high cost of dancing
problem.
"Borrowing" the music from the
Sigma Chi dance in the Women's Club
house Friday night, utilizing the classic
lighting effect of, a rising full moon, and
making the college bandstand serve as a
dancing pavilion, this resourceful couple
save precious kopecks and floated about
the floor with much the same feeling
of triumph that thrills the barefoot boy
as he gloats oyer his stolen watermelon.
The bandstand rests near the club
house, where the builders of the new
"Commons" left it when they moved it
off the site of the proposed structure.
Now "Ed and Co-ed" are wondering
how many dances they can enjoy before
the stand moves on to its future station
on the shores of Lagunita.
