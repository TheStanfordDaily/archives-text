"Commercializing the Campus Stage"
is the title of an article appearing in
the February Pictorial, which will go
on pale tomorrow. J. E. Thrash, '21,
editor ol the magazine draws his con
clusions for the article from statis
tics published by the Students' Or
ganization Fund and attacks abuses
of the campus stage in no uncertain
terms.
The fact that more money was paid
out in salaries to the advertising staff
of one organization than was spent
by it to advertise its show is one of
the many reasons pointed out to sub
stantiate the claim that the local
stage is being commercialized. The
article points out that while salaries
are paid by this organization, only
members receive the remuneration
while hard working non-members re
ceive nothing but a card of thanks.
The action advocated is that a
smaller admission be charged by or
ganizations using the proceeds of their
productions for their own personal
benefit.
