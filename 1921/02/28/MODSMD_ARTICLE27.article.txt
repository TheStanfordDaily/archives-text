# INTER-CUSS TRACK SHOWS FAST SPRINTS
## No Advance Dope Given Out by Templeton; Kirksey Stepping Out Some in 100 
### 
Better times showed up at the inter
class meet Saturday than have been seen
on the oval so far this year. Kirksey
stepped away from Sudden in the cen
tury in neat style and left the youngster
to finish his own race. The kick of the
artillery horse that Kirksey got last
week must have gone to his legs, for
they were certainly working out all right
Saturday morning.
The 440 fell to Therman Clark of the
first-year squad. Clark is new this quar
ter and comes from the south with an
interscholastic record to his credit in
the quarter.
The low sticks went easily to Jess
Wells, with Lane Falk and Williams
running close for second placers. Jess
is getting back i nto the old record
breaking form for the low and high
hurdles and will be good for his share
of the points in the spring meets.
Lane Falk has been showing better
form this year than last and looms up
as a good competitor for a place in the
stick events.
Kirksey took the broad jump Satur
day with something over seven yards.
"Dink" Templeton is still keeping the
cover on the times made in the events,
but gossip says that the straight dope is
that some fast heats arc being stepped
off in the sprints.
The freshmen weight men are going
strong. Hartranft, Ludeke, and Arthur
are heaving the shot and discus far and
wide, and as soon as they get it down
to a science of more far than wide they
will be contenders for point-gatherers.
Workouts are going on every night
now with the settling of the weather,
and results are showing up fast. The
two squads are rounding out on the
rough corners to be able to put up good
fights at the early meets.
The following events were run off:
100-vard dash—First heat: Wells first,
Bumhaugh second, Wilcox third; time.
10:3. Second heat: Kirksey first, Sud

The men turned out better to the Fri
day afternoon scrub meet last week, but
they were not all there, and Coach Tem
pleton wants it understood that what he
said in regard to credits will hold good
and the men who miss these meets will
lose out. The men who placed in the

events. Kauffman is running the mile
better all the time and is sure of a place

The men turned out better to the Fri
day afternoon scrub meet last week, but
they were not all there, and Coach Tem
pleton wants it understood that what he
said in regard to credits will hold good
and the men who miss these meets will
lose out. The men who placed in the
events in which fairly good showings
were made follow:
100-yard dash—Reed first, Hale sec
ond, Fullerton third; time, 10:4.
440 yards—Swayne lirst, Tennant sec

Mile run—Kauffman first, Booker sec

120-yard low hurdles—Doughty first,
Terman second, Gray third; time, 14:4.
Swayne and Tennant are both running
good in the quarter and are almost sure

of a place on the freshman squad.
Meyers in the half and Reed in the
sprints are of varsity caliber and are
strong contenders for places in these
events. Kauffman is running the mile
better all the time and is sure of a place
with the first year men.
Better times showed up at the inter
class meet Saturday than have been seen
on the oval so far this year. Kirksey
stepped away from Sudden in the cen
tury in neat style and left the youngster
to finish his own race. The kick of the
artillery horse that Kirksey got last
week must have gone to his legs, for
they were certainly working out all right
Saturday morning.
The 440 fell to Therman Clark of the
first-year squad. Clark is new this quar
ter and comes from the south with an
interscholastic record to his credit in
the quarter.
The low sticks went easily to Jess
Wells, with Lane Falk and Williams
running close for second placers. Jess
is getting back i nto the old record
breaking form for the low and high
hurdles and will be good for his share
of the points in the spring meets.
Lane Falk has been showing better
form this year than last and looms up
as a good competitor for a place in the
stick events.
Kirksey took the broad jump Satur
day with something over seven yards.
"Dink" Templeton is still keeping the
cover on the times made in the events,
but gossip says that the straight dope is
that some fast heats arc being stepped
off in the sprints.
The freshmen weight men are going
strong. Hartranft, Ludeke, and Arthur
are heaving the shot and discus far and
wide, and as soon as they get it down
to a science of more far than wide they
will be contenders for point-gatherers.
Workouts are going on every night
now with the settling of the weather,
and results are showing up fast. The
two squads are rounding out on the
rough corners to be able to put up good
fights at the early meets.

as a good competitor for a place in the
stick events.
Kirksey took the broad jump Satur
day with something over seven yards.
"Dink" Templeton is still keeping the
cover on the times made in the events,
but gossip says that the straight dope is
that some fast heats arc being stepped
off in the sprints.
The freshmen weight men are going
strong. Hartranft, Ludeke, and Arthur
are heaving the shot and discus far and
wide, and as soon as they get it down
to a science of more far than wide they
will be contenders for point-gatherers.
Workouts are going on every night
now with the settling of the weather,
and results are showing up fast. The
two squads are rounding out on the
rough corners to be able to put up good
fights at the early meets.

The men turned out better to the Fri
day afternoon scrub meet last week, but
they were not all there, and Coach Tem
pleton wants it understood that what he
said in regard to credits will hold good
and the men who miss these meets will
lose out. The men who placed in the
events in which fairly good showings
were made follow:
100-yard dash—Reed first, Hale sec
ond, Fullerton third; time, 10:4.
440 yards—Swayne lirst, Tennant sec
ond, Harcourt third; time, 55:3.
XBO yards—Meyers first, Wilson sec
ond, Lake third; time, 4:59 3 5.
Mile run—Kauffman first, Booker sec
ond, Ambler third; time, 2:12 2-5.
120-yard low hurdles—Doughty first,
Terman second, Gray third; time, 14:4.
Swayne and Tennant are both running
good in the quarter and are almost sure

of a place on the freshman squad.
Meyers in the half and Reed in the
sprints are of varsity caliber and are
strong contenders for places in these
events. Kauffman is running the mile
better all the time and is sure of a place
with the first year men.
Better times showed up at the inter
class meet Saturday than have been seen
on the oval so far this year. Kirksey
stepped away from Sudden in the cen
tury in neat style and left the youngster
to finish his own race. The kick of the
artillery horse that Kirksey got last
week must have gone to his legs, for
they were certainly working out all right
Saturday morning.
The 440 fell to Therman Clark of the
first-year squad. Clark is new this quar
ter and comes from the south with an
interscholastic record to his credit in
the quarter.
The low sticks went easily to Jess
Wells, with Lane Falk and Williams
running close for second placers. Jess
is getting back i nto the old record
breaking form for the low and high
hurdles and will be good for his share
of the points in the spring meets.
Lane Falk has been showing better
form this year than last and looms up
as a good competitor for a place in the
stick events.
Kirksey took the broad jump Satur
