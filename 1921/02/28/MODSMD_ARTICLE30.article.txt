# PHI DELTA THETA HAS GOOD CHANCE FOR BASKET PLAQUE
## 
### 
The Phi Delta Theta quintet defeated
the Alpha Delta Phis 4 to 3 in a stub
bornly contested court game Saturday,
and won a chance for the campus cham
pionship.
Today the Alpha Delta Phis play the
Chi Psis, and if they win they will be |
tied with the Phi Delts for the cham
pionship. The Medics dropped out of
the race by forfeiting to the Breakers ;
and Delta Upsilon fives.
Should the Alpha Delts and Phi Delts
have to play another game for intra
mural championship, the game will* un
doubtedly be a close one. Records show
the teams evenly matched, and rooters
will be found in numbers supporting
each team. One "choc malt" has already
been placed as a wager on the outcome.
Coach C. S. Botsford has announced
that the intramural leaders have agreed
to charge a small admission fee for the
deciding game, the proceeds to go to a
fund to purchase paint for the boat
house.
