Oh, Boy!! Lillian Russell in her
palmiest days or Gaby Deslys at* her
gabbiest never broke into print with
a story like this one. The actress
who started milk baths and the dancer
who had. a king making goo-goo eyes
were mere amateurs compared to the
bunch that hands out the dope on the
"Yellow Jacket." It seems that the
aforesaid body covering is SOME
garment and if you believe that it is
just an ordinary pajama upper, listen
to this:
The tale involves everything from
the Imperial Palace at Peking, the
"Forbidden City," to the artists' colony
at Carmel-by-t he-Sea, and Gordon.
Davis tells it with an absolutely
straight face.
Davis, hunting costumes for the
"Yellow Jacket," went over to Carmel
to see Anne Dare, who produced the
Chinese pantomime recently given at
the Players Club in San Francisco
with great succe&s. She lived in
China for several years and is an
authority on things Chinese.
She showed him a particularly
gorgeous mandarin's robe which fasci
nated him by its beauty. After some
hesitation, Anne Dare was finally in
duced to let him wear it in the play
and it will be seen in the forthcom
ing English Club production.
So far so good; but wait —already
the plot is growing thicker. Davis in
quired into the history of the robe
and found —that it had been stolen
from the Emperor's palace at Peking!
Dark and devious was its history
until Anne Dare got hold of it and the
robe actually exists because ye re
porter saw it. Its beauty, also, is
certainly 110 fairy tale, and Gordon
Davis, faculty dramatic coach, stoutly
maintains that it was pilfered from
the principal residence in the "For
bidden City."
You tell 'em yardstick, we can't
fathom it.
