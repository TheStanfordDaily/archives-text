# BOARD OF ATHLETIC CONTROL APPROVES PLANS FOR STADIUM
## 
### 
Approval of the report of the Engi
neering Commission on the proposed
stadium was given by the Board' "of
Athletic Control at its regular monthly
meeting which was held Saturday
afternoon in the Stanford Union. Pro
fessor C. 13. Wing, head of the com
mittee, submitted detailed plans, in
cluding blueprints, for the stadium
which in a number of respects devi
ates from the previous proposals under
consideration by the board.
The plan as amended calls for the
construction of an embankment type
of stadium which will be similar to a
horseshoe in shape. Upon three tides
of the bowl bleachers will be con
structed. The fourth side, though an
embankment, will be graded to per
mit access into the bowl by the crowds
either on foot or in automobile.
The engineering report tmakes pro
vision for a larger number of spec
tators than any of those previously
considered. The bleachers will com
fortably seat 59,000 people. The pro
vision for automobile entrance over a
graded embankment will increase this
figure. Space for standing room will
bring the total number of possible
spectators up to approximately 65,000.
Dr. A. D. Browne, Physical Direc
tor, submitted to the board an esti
mate of $2600 to cover, the cost of
athletic administration for the re
mainder of the school year. The
board approved the report, which pro
vides for the maintenance of the ath
letic staff, the financing of several
activities, and the employment of stu
dent assistants.
