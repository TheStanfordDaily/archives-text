# PLANS FOR HONOR SYSTEM BEGIN TO DEVELOP PROMISE
## Representative Students Give Views at 'Assembly; The Scheme Endorsed by Head 
### W. W. Caldwell, '24 
I The student assembly held at 9 this
morning in the Assembly Hall marks
.'in epoch iVi the history of the life and
progress of the University. For the
meeting this morning marks the first
tangible movement towards an honor
system here. For many years there has
existed on the campus a realization of
the necessity for some kind of a system
whereby Stanford men and wome/fcould
be responsible for their own conduct and
themselves judge the misconduct of
others. And today that sentiment has
crystallized into a student opinion that
stands 100 per cent for the honor sys
tem.
The assembly this morning was called
to order by Floyd McElroy, '21, presi
dent of the Associated Students, who
introduced N. R. Allen, chairman of the
committee which was appointed to in
vestigate the condition of the Daily Palo
Alto. Although the formal report is not
yet complete, AHen gave in a few words
a brief summary report to the student
body. He outlined the history of the
situation and said: "Today, the Daily
Palo Alto is standing on its own feet and
! is working out its own destiny; and will
j soon be free of all debts."
He further stated that although his
j committee had held about twelve or
thirteen meetings, they had not actively
interfered, but had stood by and watched
j the paper work out its own salvation.
Allen said that the committee plans to
recommend constitutional changes with
regard to the conduct of the paper in
order to avert any danger of financial
crises in the future. The written report
will be ready for publication in aboMt
I two weeks.
In a few words President Mc
! Elroy outlined the puprose of the meet
ing and sounded the keynote of all the
following talks. He said: "An honor
| system to be a success must come from
the students themselves and be 100 per
I cent in its expression. We have no band
| or glee club here this morning to put
this thing over on an unsuspecting stu
dent body. It* there is to be any appeal
for an honor system today, it must come
I from the floor." McElroy then intro
! duced President Wilbur, who made a
short appeal for the immediate adoption
of some form of honor system. In part
he said:
"Forget for a moment, if you can, that
I am the president of the University, and
think only of me as a graduate and
alumnus of this institution. When the
students want an honor system bad
enough to ask for it, they can have it.
One of the humorous moments of the
meeting came when Dr. Wilbur con-
I tinned: "Every cheater is a bad egg
j and we don't want him in the Stanford
j omelette.'
"We have the process of assimilating
600 or 700 new students each year. The
future of these freshmen depends upon
the surroundings and environment in
which we place them. Everyone has a
tine streak of idealism in him: it is only
necessary that we should develop it.
He added. "You must be willing,
though, to pay the price. You must be
willing to th'row out a fraternity man
or the captain of one of the varsity
teams, if necessary. Everyone guilty of
cheating must go. That is the test.
In conclusion, he said: "Think this
thing through and decide for a square
deal for your University and for your
fellow-men."
Marion Kyle. '18, chairman of the com
! mittee appointed to investigate the honor
I system, was next introduced. He ex
plained that there could be no comprc
hensive honor system plan. An honor
system means there shall he no cheating,
that is all. He announced that pledges
will be distributed tomorrow to all liv
ing groups on the campus to be signed
by the students who realize the import
ance of the honor system and sincerely
desire its adoption.
Then President McElroy called upon
a number of prominent campus men and
women to state their views upon the
question. Among those responding were
J. Patrick, president of the Senior Class;
"Swede" Righter, varsity man and all
round athlete; H. A. Brown, president
of the Interfraternity Conference; W.
F. Leiser, editor of the Daily Palo Alto;
Bernice Frankenheimer, president of
Roble Club; Dorothy Johnson, president
of the Organized Women ; E. F.. Crowe,
ex-editor of the Daily Palo Alto; P. F.
Erickson, president of the Men's Coun
cil, and M. E. Kline, prominent campus
orator. They expressed themselves as
unanimously in favor of the immediate
adoption of the honor system in all de
partments of the University.
