# BEAUTIFUL LIGHTING AND STAGING SEEN IN 'YELLOW JACKET'
## Corps of Technical Experts Working on Elaborate Plan Orchestra Music a Feature 
### 
Music, form, and color, will blend
in giving the "Yellow Jacket" one of
the most remarkable stage settings
ever seen on the campus. This ex
quisite Oriental phantasy is being
produced with a richness seldom ( at
tempted there is a genu
ine treat in store for drama lovers
when the curtain goes up on its per
formance on Tuesday, March Bth.
One of the most distinctive features
of the show will be the lighting. Some
thing never before attempted here,
that is, the use of three spotlights
all directed from the front, will give
jrtunity for an infinite variety of
color effects. The stage can be bathed
in color to suit the mood o f the scene
and individuals can be interpreted
by the light thrown upon them. Thus,
the young hero may be surrounded
with the shining pink of hope, the
heroine with the golden glow of ro
mance, and the vengeful hunchback
enveloped in sinister purple.
These effects are being worked out
by Ernest H. Greppin, '24. who is an
experienced spotlight expert. He
comes from the south and did the
spotlight work for the Pilgrimage
Play which ran all last summer in
Hollywood. The lighting on the stage
will be handled by the head electrici
an, Kenneth LeMarinel, '23. •*
A six-piece orchestra will be placed
upon the stage and will furnish inci
dental music to follow right along
with the action. This music isn't
inserted with an abrupt crash as in a
musical comedy bur blends perfectly
with the play. Orchestrations have
been completed and the musicians are
enthusiastic over the beauty of the
melodies.
Photographs of the settings used in
the original New York production have
been secured and the local scenes will
be exact eppies of these. Clyde E.
Coakley, '22, the scenic artist, is a
man who combines talent and profes
sional experience and he has
some wonderful effects with the scenic
plot.
