# WHY A STUDENT ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
Stanford students appreciate Dr. Wilbur's statements of yesterday
on the honor plan, and also his readiness to give an hour of liis,time to
the Associated Students in assembly on the honor plan. It seems that j
the more often faculty and student opinion are actually brought together |
on any definite issue, the more often we learn that the line dividing the I
two viewpoints is not as definite as is sometimes thought.
Consciousness on the part of the average undergraduate of mem
bership in the Associated Students becomes apparent at distant intervals
during a college year; usually at a quad election, or at a student assem
bly. Non-active members of a student body, members ignorant of stu
dent problems, arc comparable to non-active citizens of the United
States, a type for which Stanford does not stand.
Assemblies like that of yesterday, in which the best representative
faculty and student opinion is brought together in an attempt to get at
the bottom of a problem of University interest, promote better faculty
student understanding, help in the crystalization of student conscious
ness, and create a better university spirit.
