Alumni all over the country are
showing an active interest by the
formation of clubs to keep Stanford
people in touch with each other and
to further all affairs of the University.
The latest club to be established is
at Phoenix, Arizona. At a meeting
of twenty-seven Stanford people held
on February 7, "Chick" Orme, '16, waÂ»
elected president and plans for week
ly luncheons for the men eating in
town and a geneial monthly meeting,
were completed.
Alumni at Salt Lake have reorga
nized their club under the name of
Stanford University Alumni Associa
tion of Utah, with B. S. Crow as presi
dent. Thirty members were present
at the meeting and Dr. Swain who was
in Utah at the time addressed the
club.
Stanford people in Pasadena will
hold a meeting on Tuesday night to
discuss plans for monthly meetings.
The gathering was instigated by R. P.
Pelouze, '19, and Alumni Secretary
McDowell will be present at the meet
ing. Two other clubs are in the mak
ing, one at Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the
other in Tulare county, probobly to
be located at Visalia. There are a
large number of Stanford men through
out Oklahoma engaged in work in the
oil fields, who are very anxious to ar
range a permanent club for meetings.
Even Mexico has its interested
Stanford men according to a letter
ireceived from Howard F. Nash in
which he tells of a reunion held by
I

a few members of the Mining Depart- i
ment recently, at Tampico. The Ret
together was entirely successful, and
plans have been made for similar
meetings to follow.
Other clubs formed during the past
year are those at San Francisco,
Riverside, Oakland, and in Orange
county.
