# H.J. RYAN IS DIRECTOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS
## 
### 
Professor Harris J. Ryan, head of
the Electrical Engineering Department,
has worked steadily through a long
career toward one purpose, and this has
been the building up of an enduring re
lation of co-operation between the Uni
versity and technical men in practice.
Back in the pioneer days of electrical
engineering, the year following his
graduation from Cornell in 18K7, Pro
fessor Ryan entered business with J. G.
White and I). C. Jackson, organizing
the Western Engineering Company,
with Lincoln, Nebraska, as their head
quarters. After a year in practice, Pro
fessor Ryan discovered that he belonged
to the University and to research work.
He there conceived the idea that he
should aid the University to co-operate
more generally with men in the field.
Believing that practice as a consult
ing engineer tended to disrupt his pro.
gram of co-operation, Professor Ryan
lias accepted employment in but two
cases—one only of a major character.
He has served as a member <>f the board
of consulting engineers for the Los An
geles aqueduct power project since 1909.
He felt this to be a duty to the public
as well as one of co-operation with the
chief electrical engineer of the project,
who was his graduate student at Cornell.
Otherwise lie lias, in the words of 1 ho
reau, "hewn to the line and lei the chips
fall where they may."
! Professor Ryan was born on a farm
near Harrisburg, and was sent to Balti
| more for his early schooling. In 1879 he
! entered Baltimore City College and in
ISBI transferred to Lebanon \ alley
College, Pennsylvania, taking a "class
ical" course. From there he went to
Cornell in 1883 in preparation for his
life work of mechanical and electrical
engineering, graduating in 1887.
After a year in business he went back
; to Cornell as instructor in charge of
| the electrical machinery laboratory. In
j 1895 he was given a full professorship
and made head o! the Department of
Electrical Engineering. This was in the
days when electricity had just begun to
| come into its own. The country was
eager for men to take up this work, in
dustries were being electrified, and Cor
nell turned out large classes to meet the
urgent demand. During this time Pro
fessor Ryan came in touch with men
from Stanford, and the things they told

him about California made him want to
live here. So he gladly accepted a call
to Stanford in 1905 and has been here
continuously since that time.
With one exception Professor Ryan
has never had time to write books for,
as he put it, "he has been engaged in the
actual work of 'going over the top,' with
no time left for 'mopping up' and 'con
solidation.'" He has contributed over
sixty monographs on electrical research.
Before leaving Cornell he had begun
the study of high voltage phenomena in
relation to long distance transmission of
power. This work has been continued
steadily at Stanford.
During the war he was chairman of
one of the two American groups of the
National Research Council that worked
upon anti submarine supersonics, and
was placed in charge of the laboratory
built for supersonic research in Pasa
dena. This group worked in conjunction
with three others of its kind in New
York, France, and England. They con
lined themselves largely to perfecting
the searchecho to be used in locating
enemy submarines in hiding.
This spring Professor Ryan will co
operate with the engineers of the South
ern California Edison Company in
equipping a thirty-mile section of the
Big Creek to Los Angeles transmission
for an experimental tryout of 220,000
volts, in preparation for the use of such
high voltage on long lines.
He is a member of the National Acad
emy of Sciences, Fellow of the Amer
ican Association for the Advancement
of Science. American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers, the American Electro
chemical Society, the Institute of Radio
Engineers, American Physical Society,
Phi Kappa Psi. Sigma Xi, and lan
Met a Pi.
in the summer Professor Ryan for
gets his labors for a while and travels
from Tia Jnana to Vancouver, generally
iu the "old Ford," on reconnaisance. He
likes to get out into the open country
and see other people in all walks of life.
He enjoys the better motion pictures
and does not miss many that are worth
while.
His dominant idea in University rou
tine work is that all effort on the part
of the student and of the faculty mem
ber should be for the highest benefit and
the heartiest approval of the person the
student will be 'ten years after.
