# American Legion Team Postpones Soccer Game
## 
### 
The game scheduled for Saturday be
tween the American Legion soccer team
and the Italian Club of San Francisco
was postponed for two weeks on ac
count of the inability of the latter to
have their full team present. The game
was to have been played at Eighth and
Market, San Francisco. The next game
the Legion team lias is with the Olympic
Club next Saturday on the same field.
The next varsity contest is with the
Union Iron Works eleven on the local
turf next Saturday. Plans for trips
have not yet matured, but it is possible
that some big excursion will take place
before the year is over.
