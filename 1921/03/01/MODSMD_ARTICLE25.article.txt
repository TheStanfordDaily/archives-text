Work of the quality displayed by
' the Stanford 135-lbs- basketball team
' last Saturday and throughout the sea
: son deserves recognition by the stu-
I dent body.
That weight teams have come into
I our athletic system to stay, is the
! opinion of most coaches at Stanford
j and California. Some predict that the
limited system will be applied to
i other sports besides basketball.
In that event Stanford should show
appreciation to these men who repre
sent her by awarding some distinctive
letter, such as the English "S", to the
men who qualify according to the stan
dards set for other sports.
So far as sounded out student opini
on will unanimously support a ruling
by the Executive Committee to that
effect. All the coaches favor the
plan. Walter Warren. '22
