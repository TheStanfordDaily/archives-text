"The Tiger in the House," by Carl Van
Vechten. New York: Alfred A.
Knopf, 1920. i
Even novelists do not fall into a sud
den violence of dispute about the com
parative virtues of elephants and dodos,
dinosaurs and giraffes and horned bison.
Nor has the dog ever lacked apologists
for his supposed admirable fidelity to
the master man. Alone among animals,
cats have ever roused humanity to equal
furies of hate and love. About cats men
do not differ mildly: they detest or they
adore with a bitter distinctness often
edging into serious pathological cases
like Napoleon and others less famous
whom cats transfixed into mortal loath
ing.
In opposition to these "cases" almost
all great French writers of the nine
teenth century devoted years to the pas
sionate but never blatant study of the
animal fascinating in his mysterious de
tachment from humanity. To this long
list of distinguished writers must now
be added Mr. Carl Van Vechten, in
public life a critic of music, in private
life a patient envisager of cats. For his
serious delightful study he has massed
an elaborate ethnology, a veritable out
line of the cat in history, painting,
science, music, dcmonologv, folk-lore,
literature, religion.
The bibliography itself is imposing in
minuteness and rich in devious lore. In
love or hate Mr. Van Vechten is never
hysterical, and never does he go beyond
facts which any other investigator can
not himself attest. ")ften Mr. Van
Vachten is more the cholar than the
creative histprian; but the foot-notes are
often more interesting than the text â€”
not a usual fault in scholarship. The
included photography is really wonder
ful and enchanting. The cat, most digni
fied and seclusive of artists, does not
easily lend his majestic indifference to
the vacuous bland postures required by
the manipulator of cameras.
Considered either as serious ethnology
or merely as personal biography of vari
ous jointly celebrated cats, "The Tiger
in the House" is the only complete and
authentic study of the cat in the Fnglish
language, and no less remarkable for its
intelligence lhan for its inclusiveness.
