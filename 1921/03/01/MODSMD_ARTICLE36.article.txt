; feited to the Delta Upsilons. Brown,
j the star forward of the Medic combi
! nation, has tonsillitis, and Baker who
| played standing guard has a sprained
ankle.
Yesterday's game was an easy vic
tory for the Alpha Delts. Phelps was
the individual star for the winners,
shooting 11 points in the last half.
Gerson and Neer at forward put on a
fast exhibition of team work, and Pol
lard and Kline developed a defense
that was like barbed-wire entangle
ments to the Chi Psi attack.
Doherty, playing running guard for
I the Chi Psis, was active on defense,
j and showed up well by his speedy
dribbling. J. Wallace, at forward,
made two goals on long tries from the
center of the court. Wilcox, Hugh
Wallace and Schlaudemann fought a
hard, but losing game.
