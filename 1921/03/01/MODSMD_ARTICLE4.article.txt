# SPRING CARNIVAL WILL BE MODELLED AFTER SPANISH FIESTAS OF EARLY TIMES
## Date for Annual Event Will Be Recommended at Meeting or Executive Committee Tonight 
### 
The Spring Carnival this year will take the form of a fiesta, a real old
fashioned representation of the fiestas that have been held in Spain and the
Spanish-American countries for centuries, and formed the chief day of annual
amusement in the early days of California. The joy spirit will reign supreme
for an entire evening of merriment, and the whole carnival will be made as
near like a native Spanish celebration as possoble.
Carnival Manager James Petrini, '21, has divided his committee into the
following departments: Dan W. Evans, director of concessions; E. N. Farmer,
art director; B. S. Parks, superintendent of construction; J. E. Simpson, pur
chasing agent and director of Finance; Russell Sewall, director of entertain
ment; W. T. Martin, dancing arrangements; T. R. Carskadon, director of off
campus publicity; W. C. Evans, director of campus publicity; Stark Draper,
head electrician; Anne Hardy, ticket sellers and takers; Laura Getz, secretary
carnival committee; Dorris Anderson, aid on campus arrangements; Bernice
McDivitt, aid on Concessions; W. F. Lewis, aid on Construction.

Director of Concessions Dan W.
Evans is working out the plans of the
details of the Spanish program of the
Carnival evening. The enclosure sur
rounding the gymnasium has been
again selected to house the annual
event and the space will be trans
figured into a Spanish city. Quaint
dwellings of the Latin type will house
the concessions and the streets will
be narrowed down with the over hang
ing balconies that line the streets of
the Spanish cities and the Spanish-
American countries. While the shows
of the Carnival will offer a varied type
of entertainment they will be on the
Spanish style as much as possible. A
Spanish theatre with some of the best
Latin talent available to carry off the
parts will be one of the attractions.
Miniature Tiajuanas, Spanish cabarets,
and a bull-fight will be among the
entertainments of the evening.
Many specialty entertainments that
will be free will add to the good time
of trie show. Jt is tne plan of In<\
committee to start the evening off
