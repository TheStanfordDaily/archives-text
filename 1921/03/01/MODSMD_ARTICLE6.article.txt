# Return Tournament In Handball Is Planned
## 
### 
A return handball tournament has
been arranged between Stanford and
and University of California for April
2. Due to a lack of interest in hand
ball at California, only one player ar
rived for the meet last Saturday, and
tho doubles sets were consequently
forfeited to Stanford. The Bears have
asked for a chance to vindicate them
selves, and accordingly a contest has
been scheduled at the Berkeley Y. M.
C. A. courts. The men who will repre
sent tho Cardinal are Lowenstein,
Kabo, M. Cohen, Sansone, Colvin. Two
sets of doubles and one singles set
will be played.
