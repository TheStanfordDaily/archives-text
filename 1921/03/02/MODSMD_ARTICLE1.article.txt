# APRIL 15 AND 16 SET AS DATE FOR SPRING CARNIVAL
## Proceeds to Be Used to Send Cardinal Track Team East For Intercollegiate Meet 
### 
April 15 and 16 were granted to the
Spring Carnival last night by the Execu
tive Committee. These dates are a
change from the original time, due to
the track meet with California that is
set for Saturday, April 16. The plan of
the Carnival Committee is now to in
clude the Saturday in the entertainment
and make the celebration last over two
days.
The program of the first night will
be as planned before, with the conces
sions and the evening of the fiesta play
time on Friday. On the following morn
ing there will be a swimming meet here
in the Encina pool between Stanford
and the Californians.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the an
nual Stanford-California track meet
will be run off. There will also be
varsity tennis matches after the meet.
To these events there will be several
thousand rooters from the University
of California and as many more people
from San Francisco and the peninsula, in
addition to the Stanford quota.
For the benefit of these outside people
some of the concessions and variety en
tertainments will be reshown and in the
evening a grand ball will be given in
either the Encina Gymnasium or one of
the other large campus halls.
Arrangements this year are to stage
the Carnival on a%more stupendous scale
than ever before and to put it on a par
with the yearly sport offerings of the
other large universities of the country.
The track meet'and first baseball game,
coming as they do on the same day, will
make the biggest drawing card that the
University could possibly get in the
of an attraction to the outside people.
a good time for all and the dance
in the evening will wind up a two-day
round of pleasure that will be hard to
beat.
Many campus organizations are freely
offering their services to the committee
already. Skull and Snakes, Ram's Head,
Hammer and Coffin, and other organiza
tions either have concessions or work
in the staging of the various parts of
the show.
A large percentage of the California
people will come down here the night
before and will go to the celebration.
