						SPANISH CARNIVAL
## 
### 
That Spanish fiesta atmosphere to be injected into the Spring Carni
val will without doubt meet with unanimous campus approval. The
carnival as it lias developed in the last three years has become one of the
most looked-forward-to events of the spring - calendar.
The committee this year has undertaken a more elaborate program
than has previously been attempted, and is receiving the cooperation of
all living groups. With considerable satisfaction we note that the pro
ceeds of the venture are to be used in sending the track team east, and
the men under Templeton and Kirksey should have a royal trip it the
carnival continues to progress on the scale outlined and with the enthusi
asm that is this far evidenced.

TWO COMMUNICATIONS received yesterday by The Daily would
have been printed today had the writers attached their names. It is a
general rule that opinions are published with signatures. However,
when the writer has reason for withholding his name, his wish may be
respected, but in any event the name should be communicated to the
editor.
