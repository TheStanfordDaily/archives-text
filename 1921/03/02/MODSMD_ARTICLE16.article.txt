Discussion following the steadily in
creasing number of casualties among
"ruffs" at the Women's Clubhouse
brought out the suggestion that life nets
be placed around the building to insure
;i soft landing place for those who fall
from the window sills.
"Ruff" experts agree that unless some

ford will soon become an asylum ( for

the cherished institution of "ruffing"
will perish from the campus.
Joe Stash, alias for the man whose
name is being withheld, points out that
attendance at the Saturday night session
was only half what it was the preceding
night, when he won his wound stripe.
He says casualties in the "ruff" ranks
are demoralizing the forces, and has

called a convention of loyal members
at the Kappa Alpha house Thursday
