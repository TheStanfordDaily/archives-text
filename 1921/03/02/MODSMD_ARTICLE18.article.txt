# CLEAN SPORTSMANSHIP IS IDEAL OF H. W. MALONEY
## 
### 
"No man has done more for the de
velopment of Stanford's ideals of clean
Sportsmanship than Harry Maloney."
This declaration comes from no less an
authority than Professor John P. Mitch
ell, secretary of the Board of Athletic
Control.
Henry Wilfred Maloney, affectionately
known as "Harry" by the students, is
Director of Minor Sports. He got his
early athletic education in a military
athletic training school in Dublin, Ire
land.
After graduation he served in the
Boer war under Colonel Douglas Haig,
who became general-in-chief of the Brit
ish forces in France in the World War.
Maloney then came to the United
States and established a gymnastic
school in Pasadena. After several years
there lie came to Stanford as roach of
gymnastics, in 1908. Later he became
trainer of the football squad, and
studied medicine at the same time.
In 1910 Maloney took charge of the
University boxers and soccer team. As
soccer coach his record is phenomenal.
For nine consecutive years the Cardinal
defeated the Blue and Gold. During the
war, while Maloney was absent, the
Bruins won for two years, but with his
return the Stanford team won the cham
pionship again this year.
Maloney lias always been deeply inter
ested in intercollegiate minor sports, and
il is largely due to his efforts that these
activities receive the recognition they
have in the West. He led the move
ment which resulted in the awarding of
the block circle "S" to minor sport ath
letes.
When the United States entered the
war Maloney received a captaincy on
the strength of his Boer war service. He
went to the llrst officers' training camp
at tlie Presidio, then returned to Stan
ford for a short time, and later went to
Camp Fremont as athletic officer.
He went overseas with the Eighth
Division, which arrived too late for
service in the front line. After the sign
ing of the armistice he was appointed
athletic officer at Brest. His work in
this position was extremely difficult, but
he performed the task' so well that Gen
eral Pershing congratulated him per
sonally for it.

He was then appointed coach and
trainer of the American athletes enter
ing the Inter-Allied Games at Paris.
After the overwhelming victory of his
team, Maloney again received the per
sonal congratulations of General Persh
ing.
Returning to Stanford, Maloney re
sumed his duties in the gymnasium.
He has won international fame since
then as a rugby coach. The Christmas
vacation trip taken by the rugby men
to Canada for the last two years is now
regarded as a permanent custom.
He was coach of the American rugby
team that won the world's championship
last summer in the Olympic Games, and
later defeated the best teams of Belgium
and France, where rugby is the leading
sport. Ten of the fifteen men of this
team were Stanford men, trained here
by Maloney.
He has always been a staunch advo
cate of clean sports, and his success in
instilling his ideals into his teams is
shown by the favorable comments made
on the sportsmanship shown by his men
wherever they have gone. Just recently
Dr. Wilbur received a letter from Col
onel Bell Irving, of Vancouver, one of
the best-known sportsmen of the North
west, congratulating Stanford on having
such athletes and true sportsmen as were
on the squad that made the northern
trip.
How Maloney took charge of the
track team last season against his own
personal desires, because there was no
one else available, and worked himself
into a nervous wreck turning out one
of the best teams Stanford ever had, is
too well known to need repetition.
He is a strong supporter of Stanford's
system of athletics, where everyone can
enter athletics, but where sports are not
everything in a man's college career.
"We aim to have so many sports that
every man can find the thing he likes.
Every man can do something well. We
help the men find out what they can do,
and incidentally we are developing
future varsity material.
"Stanford is an unusual university. I
have never found the same ideals and
taste for clean sports in any other
place. Our men play to win. but. above
all. they play like sportsmen."
"No man has done more for the de
velopment of Stanford's ideals of clean

last summer in the Olympic Games, and
later defeated the best teams of Belgium
and France, where rugby is the leading
sport. Ten of the fifteen men of this
team were Stanford men, trained here
by Maloney.
He has always been a staunch advo
cate of clean sports, and his success in
instilling his ideals into his teams is
shown by the favorable comments made
on the sportsmanship shown by his men
wherever they have gone. Just recently
Dr. Wilbur received a letter from Col
onel Bell Irving, of Vancouver, one of
the best-known sportsmen of the North
west, congratulating Stanford on having
such athletes and true sportsmen as were
on the squad that made the northern
trip.
How Maloney took charge of the
track team last season against his own
personal desires, because there was no
one else available, and worked himself
into a nervous wreck turning out one
of the best teams Stanford ever had, is
too well known to need repetition.
He is a strong supporter of Stanford's
system of athletics, where everyone can
enter athletics, but where sports are not
everything in a man's college career.
"We aim to have so many sports that
every man can find the thing he likes.
Every man can do something well. We
help the men find out what they can do,
and incidentally we are developing
future varsity material.
"Stanford is an unusual university. I
have never found the same ideals and
taste for clean sports in any other
place. Our men play to win. but. above
all. they play like sportsmen."
"No man has done more for the de
velopment of Stanford's ideals of clean
Sportsmanship than Harry Maloney."
This declaration comes from no less an
authority than Professor John P. Mitch
ell, secretary of the Board of Athletic
Control.
Henry Wilfred Maloney, affectionately
known as "Harry" by the students, is
Director of Minor Sports. He got his
early athletic education in a military
athletic training school in Dublin, Ire
land.
After graduation he served in the
Boer war under Colonel Douglas Haig,
who became general-in-chief of the Brit
ish forces in France in the World War.
Maloney then came to the United
States and established a gymnastic
school in Pasadena. After several years
there lie came to Stanford as roach of
gymnastics, in 1908. Later he became
trainer of the football squad, and
studied medicine at the same time.
In 1910 Maloney took charge of the
University boxers and soccer team. As
soccer coach his record is phenomenal.
For nine consecutive years the Cardinal
defeated the Blue and Gold. During the
war, while Maloney was absent, the
Bruins won for two years, but with his
return the Stanford team won the cham
pionship again this year.
Maloney lias always been deeply inter
ested in intercollegiate minor sports, and
il is largely due to his efforts that these
activities receive the recognition they
have in the West. He led the move
ment which resulted in the awarding of
the block circle "S" to minor sport ath
letes.
When the United States entered the
war Maloney received a captaincy on
the strength of his Boer war service. He
went to the llrst officers' training camp
at tlie Presidio, then returned to Stan
ford for a short time, and later went to
Camp Fremont as athletic officer.
He went overseas with the Eighth
Division, which arrived too late for
service in the front line. After the sign
ing of the armistice he was appointed
athletic officer at Brest. His work in
this position was extremely difficult, but
he performed the task' so well that Gen
eral Pershing congratulated him per
sonally for it.

He was then appointed coach and
trainer of the American athletes enter
ing the Inter-Allied Games at Paris.
After the overwhelming victory of his
team, Maloney again received the per
sonal congratulations of General Persh
ing.
Returning to Stanford, Maloney re
sumed his duties in the gymnasium.
He has won international fame since
then as a rugby coach. The Christmas
vacation trip taken by the rugby men
to Canada for the last two years is now
regarded as a permanent custom.
He was coach of the American rugby
team that won the world's championship
last summer in the Olympic Games, and
later defeated the best teams of Belgium
and France, where rugby is the leading
sport. Ten of the fifteen men of this
