# BOXING MEET TO BE STAGED UNDER WAR DEPARTMET RULES
## 
### 
Coach Murphy and "Bobbie" John
son, California boxing coach, have
agreed that the meet on March 11
shall be conducted under the rulea of
the War Department which were
drawn up during the war. They are
practically the same as the A. A. U.
rules and call for three two-minute
rounds with one-minute rests. An
extra round may be ordered in case
no decision is reached at the end of
the third. A referee and two judges
shall decide the contests.
No definite men have been selected
as officials but California has recom
mended that they be chosen from the
following men: Billy Leonard, Joe
Niderost, Phil Noonan, Sol Levinson,
Joe Hiekey, and Lester Hink, all of
the Olympic Club. They are men of
experience and Coach Murphy will
approve the selection from them.
It has never been definitely an
nounced that California forfeited the
lightweight bout of last year's meet
between Jerry Hurley and Wheeler of
California, due to the fact that
Wheeler used the pivot punch and
this blow has always been considered
a foul. With this bout California had
enough points to win the tournament.
Bill Burkhart is rapidly getting a
fighting edge which promises to bring
home a Cardinal victory in the welter
weight class. Carter is working every
day and is in perfect condition, tipping
the beam at 194 pounds. Jimmy Ross
has been running the mile in the
weekly track meets and three two
minute rounds will be just a mild
pastime for him.
Hodges, lightweight, and Wassum,
middleweight, are different in size but
they both have the same peculiarity
of a trip-hammer punch. Wassum has
a tremendous wallop and can take
them just as hard as he delivers them.
Hodges gives no appearance of bulg
ing muscle and Samson tendencies, but
somewhere in those arms of his is the
stuff which makes for knockouts.
Simmons is as hard as nails and the
littlo fellow is showing more class
every day. All these men, with the
exception of Wassum, will mix in
som« exhibition bouts at the Base
Hospital this evening to help the war
veterans put over their show for the
benefit of the patients.
