j The Yellow Jacket
This English Club play that is to
be staged Tuesday evening ought to
j draw a pretty big crowd for it's some
thing worth seeing. It gives us a
' chance of seeing "how the Chinese
;do it." Besides this, Gordon Davis
i who is to take the principal role is
a professional actor of experience and ;
has a knowledge of all the tricks of j
the stage. The play was a decided |
j success- while playing at Carmel and
| should certainly receive appreciation
j from a college audience.
I 'Crime Will Out"
We see where the Ram's Head is
getting the axe. That's too bad when
j the condemned banquet was to be, or,;
j rather is to be, held on April first.
We wonder if it will an April Fool's
| party after all. At least we have food '
i for our promising young journalists, |
I and they probably won't overlook it,
so duck your heads, Ram's Headers.!
One-Act Plays to be Given
Popular campus talent will produce!
one-act plays in the Little Theatre,;
March 10 and 11. Gordon Davis as
snres those that desire to attend that
the doors will be open at the end of
each play to facilitate exits.
Greenwich Village Follies Score Hit
The Greenwich Village at the '
I Curran Theatre in San Francisco are
| still drawing a big per cent of the |
j campus theatre-goers. This is the.|
I last week of the Follies, as the en- j
gagement claaes Saturday night. It
is a musical comedy that bubbles over |
with jazz and wit. Ted Lewis' or
chestra is one of the biggest scores of j
tho show and he alone is worth going
to see.
