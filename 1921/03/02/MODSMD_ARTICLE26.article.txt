# FRESHMAN BASEBALL WILL OPEN SEASON SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Freshman baseball begins its season
next Saturday afternoon when the team
meets the Mountain View High School
nine on the lield here at 2:30 in the
afternoon. The squad has been practic
ing for almost a month now. and the
ones who have showed up consistently
have made marked improvement.
As the practice has advanced prob
able men" for different positions are
looming up individually. Behind the
plate Huneke and Holmes are showing
the most stuff. At first base Strong,
May, Cross, and Atwill, who has just
started coming out. are the leading can
didates. Second base is being contested
for by Deffenbach and Hawkins. Short
will be held down by Captain Woodward.
Smurr and Dwight are the two most
promising aspirants for the corner posi
tion at third base.
Several men are chasing flies in the
outer pastures, among whom the best
seem to be Collins, Liebendorfer, T'uller,
Ehrhorn, and Chandler. There are a lot
of others trying out, but they have not
; as yet shown enough consistent practice.
The pitching staff is at present a
i weak part of the team. Several hurlers,
i among them Mertz. Loewenstein, Lo
| bree. Bonner, and Fry, are trying out,
I hut they need a lot more work and prac
! tice to round out a good staff.
The main thing needed now is hard
j practice and plenty of it. Captain Wood-
I ward has his men out every afternoon,
and if the squad comes through in prac
tice as it should there will be a vast
improvement. This improvement is badly
I needed if tlie team is to make any kind
j of a showing at all.
Coaching will take a more systematic
form with the advent of "Swede
Righter on the scene next week. New
land, and once in a while Powell, have
| done what intermittent coaching has
been done heretofore, and with more
! regular coaching chances are increased.
No cut in the squad has yet been made.
Righter will have charge of that when
lie assumes his duties next week.
