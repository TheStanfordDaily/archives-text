# Mysterious Beauty Aids â€”But You Tell 'Em, Arabia I've Been Out All Night
## 
### 
Pass the incense, Hortense. When it
comes to handing out atmosphere this
English Club crowd certainly wins the
diamond-studded slide rule. They think
that they really have a play in their
"Yellow Jacket," and compared to the
talking they do about it, the erstwhile
kaiser was a shrinking violet.
Monday they sprang one about the
leading man's kimono being originally
snatched from the emperor's palace at
Peking, and now they come right back
with another one. The first one may
have knocked you cold, but in the ele
gant language of the comic song, "Yofr
ain't heard nothing yet."
This latest brainstorm is also con
cerned with costumes and involves a
mysterious Oriental beauty who refuse,
to let her name be divulged. It seems
that the group of Chinese players sent to
San Francisco .to assist in the recent
Chinese New Year's celebration has a
wonderful collection of sacred and sym
bolical costumes.
Gordon Davis, director of tlie play,
tried in every way to get a glimpse of
these trappings, but was everywhere met
with the cold impassivity of the Oriental.
In despair, he went to a beautiful Chi
nese girl who occupies a position of
responsibility with a large linn in San
Francisco.
She pulled some mysterious wires, and
lo! not only did Davis see the costumes,
but some of them were actually loaned
to him.
She smilingly accepted his thanks, but
cautioned him that not a hint of her
identity must reach the outer world.
Check!
