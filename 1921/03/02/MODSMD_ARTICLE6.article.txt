# BASEBALL TODAY SHAPES TEAM FOR OLYMPIC CONTEST
## Varsity to Meet Team From Fort McDowell On Local Diamond This Afternoon 
### 
Coach Seay put his men through a
stiff hitting and fielding and practicc
last in preparation for the game
with the Fort McDowell nine, which
will be played on the local diamond
this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
Ihe visitors have never annexed a
fast reputation and the Cardinal nine
expect an easy victory, but it will give
them a chance to get their eyes on the
ball in preparation for the game with
tffe Olympic Club next Saturday.
In the early part of the practicc yes
terday Coach Seay drove out some long
flies and the way our outfielders tore
hack after them and pulled them down
was good tonic to a fan's system. Then
they split up for some practice with
the stick and walloped the apple to all
points of the field. Kline and Crowe
show the most consistency in driving
the ball to unguarded territory. Crowe's
favorite groove is right over second.
Patterson is one of the trimmest and
surest players on the team. He handles
his job a*t first without a fluke or a
fumble. When "Pat" is at the plate
with the stick you can always figure on
something different from the old song
of one-two-three-out. And "Pat" has
something besides his mitt and agility—
he uses his head.
Heckendorf, at third, is the sort of
player who makes the fans sit back on
their plank with the hope still hanging
on strong no matter how far in the hole
the home team may be. Ground balls
have no terrors for "Lefty"' and infield
flics might just as well fall into a
basket. When he walks to the plate,
takes an extra hitch in his belt, twists
the peak of his cap, and squares himself
—well, he-means business, that's all.
The whole team is showing up good,
both first and second string men. They
have the earmarks of a winning club
and when the time for the Oriental trip
rolls around the dope all points to some
real playing. Draper and Green are at
present the strongest slabsters, but the
season is just beginning, and Nef, Kelly,
and, Haley give promise of developing
into good men. Back of them are Swartz
and Rousselot, who are both throwing
well. Kallaiu, last year's captain, is a
veteran and plays a heady, fast game at
short. He has a bad foot which has
kept him on the limp, but it was better
yesterday and lie may get into the game
this afternoon.
