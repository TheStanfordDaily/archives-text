representing the University of Oregon
for Pacific Coast League honors Friday

Binkley, '19, will meet the Univ<«*ity
of Washington team on the local plat
form at the same time. The advisability
of legislation prohibiting strikes in the
essential industries will be the subject
for discussion.
Previous experience in debating the
same question gives the Seattle squad
the advantage in the contest here. They
recently defeated a team from Prince
ton and have been under the instruc
tion of Karl Leib, a former Stanford
debate coach, throughout the forensic
season. James Bailey and Robert Mc-
Farland will represent the Seattle uni
versity.
Attention in local debating circles has
been centered on labor problems during
the last two seasons. The waiving of
the constitutionality of the question
chosen for the league contest is ex
pected to make Friday's debate one of
more than usual interest. The two
teams have been under the supervision
of Coach M. L. McClintock since his
return to the University this quarter
and arc in a postiion to discuss every
phase of the question.
The contest with Washington will be
