# THIRD SERIES GAME FRIDAY; DREAMLAND OR AT HARMON GYM
## Stanford Seat Sale will Open in Administration Building Thursday; Jim Cave will be Referee 
### 
Dreamland Rink at Sutter and Steiner Streets, in San Francisco, or
Harmon Gymnasium in Berkeley, will be the scene of the third game between
the Stanford and California basketball teams, next Friday evening. The
time of the game 8 o'clock and the date, Friday, March 4, are definite. As
the Daily goes to press, Graduate Managers Martin and Nichols, of Stanford
and California respectively, are making a final effort to secure the San Fran
cisco location for the crucial game and indications are that they will be suc
cessful, Dreamland Rink is preferred for this contest, because of its greater
seating capacity and central location. In case it is impossible to secure it
the game will take place in Harmon Gymnasium.

Jim Cave, who officiated in a number
of football games last fall, will be the
referee in the deciding game- of the
series. Cave is a man of integrity and
ability as an official and his selection as
the eleventh man on the court is a good
one.
Coach Powell is putting the varsity
through its regular practices each even
ing in preparation for the coming claspic
with the Berkeley aggregation. Most of
the hard work has been done and the
team has now reached its finest point,
so that the practices are merely for tho
purpose of keeping the men on edge.
This third game of the series will cer
tainly be worth going miles to see. The
first two games were unusually close for
basketball games and there was not a
great deal to choose between either of
the teams. Stanford, however, is con
cedcd the edge if for no other reason
than its pair of victories over the Uni
versity of Washington when that team
visited California. The Bruins were
only able to defeat the northerners once
and that was by the narrow margin of
one point. The that the Car
dinal quintet dropped two games to the
Purple and Gold quintet in the north
land may be easily met by a glance at
the standings of the two teams that
Stanford contested on that northern
to'ur.
—Powell will start the team that has
been so successful in most, of the en
counters this season. Rigliter and Davies
will play the forward positions, with
Bert Mills touching them off at center,
and Captain Fred Adams and Dick Rich
mond doing the defensive work. This
combination is one of the strongest on
flie Pacific Slope and they will force the
Bruins to move some in order to win.
Coach Wight will probably start Coop
J and Douthit in the forward positions.
Jeff Larkey is the regular center of the
| California team, and Le Hane, Eggles
ton, and Captain Jack Symes are guards.
Tickets for Stanford students will be
| placed on sale at the booth in the Ad
; ministration Building, Thursday from
i 1:30 4 p.m., and on Friday from 12:30
j to 2 o'clock.
One ticket will be allowed each peif.ui
presenting a student body card. A
| person may present more • than one
! card, however. The admission will
; be 35 cents to card holders and $1
to outsiders.

land may be easily met by a glance at
the standings of the two teams that
Stanford contested on that northern
to'ur.
—Powell will start the team that has
been so successful in most, of the en
counters this season. Rigliter and Davies
will play the forward positions, with
Bert Mills touching them off at center,
and Captain Fred Adams and Dick Rich
mond doing the defensive work. This
combination is one of the strongest on
flie Pacific Slope and they will force the
Bruins to move some in order to win.
Coach Wight will probably start Coop
J and Douthit in the forward positions.
Jeff Larkey is the regular center of the
| California team, and Le Hane, Eggles
ton, and Captain Jack Symes are guards.
Tickets for Stanford students will be
| placed on sale at the booth in the Ad
; ministration Building, Thursday from
i 1:30 4 p.m., and on Friday from 12:30
j to 2 o'clock.
One ticket will be allowed each peif.ui
presenting a student body card. A
| person may present more • than one
! card, however. The admission will
; be 35 cents to card holders and $1
to outsiders.
Dreamland Rink at Sutter and Steiner Streets, in San Francisco, or
Harmon Gymnasium in Berkeley, will be the scene of the third game between
the Stanford and California basketball teams, next Friday evening. The
time of the game 8 o'clock and the date, Friday, March 4, are definite. As
the Daily goes to press, Graduate Managers Martin and Nichols, of Stanford
and California respectively, are making a final effort to secure the San Fran
cisco location for the crucial game and indications are that they will be suc
cessful, Dreamland Rink is preferred for this contest, because of its greater
seating capacity and central location. In case it is impossible to secure it
the game will take place in Harmon Gymnasium.

Jim Cave, who officiated in a number
of football games last fall, will be the
referee in the deciding game- of the
series. Cave is a man of integrity and
ability as an official and his selection as
the eleventh man on the court is a good
one.
Coach Powell is putting the varsity
through its regular practices each even
ing in preparation for the coming claspic
with the Berkeley aggregation. Most of
the hard work has been done and the
team has now reached its finest point,
so that the practices are merely for tho
purpose of keeping the men on edge.
This third game of the series will cer
tainly be worth going miles to see. The
first two games were unusually close for
basketball games and there was not a
great deal to choose between either of
the teams. Stanford, however, is con
cedcd the edge if for no other reason
than its pair of victories over the Uni
versity of Washington when that team
visited California. The Bruins were
only able to defeat the northerners once
and that was by the narrow margin of
one point. The that the Car
dinal quintet dropped two games to the
Purple and Gold quintet in the north
land may be easily met by a glance at
the standings of the two teams that
Stanford contested on that northern
to'ur.
