# PROFESSOR RENDTORFF DISCUSSES GERMAN TRIP
## Development of New German Republic Is Subject of Tuesday Evening Lecture 
### 
"Germany regards the war as a closed
chapter. She is now looking for a new
hasis of adjustment and must work out
her ow-n salvation," said Professor K.
G. Rendtorff last evening in the Little
Theater in the observations
he had made during his recent trip
through Germany. Germany has many
dormant qualities which her new po
litical organization can bring to the sur
face, he believes, and the future of the
country lies in the ability of the Ger
man people to work. Her motto now is
'Hope and work even more.
Professor Rendtorff traced the history
of Germany and the development of the
new German republic, explaining her
present problems in the light in which
he was able to view them through close
and ultimate contact with the people
themselves during his four months' visit
in Germany. A new Germany, he said,
was born November 9, 1919, and is to
day facing a new crisis, the outcome of
which may only be speculated upon.
Professor Rendtorff, however, believes
in the stability of the republican form of
government and places his confidence in
the German people and their constitu
tion. Bolshevism l\e considers the worst
enemy of Germany at the present time,
but believes that this movement will
never bccome. strong enough to be a real
menace.
Germany is still suffering from the
war, and will continue to suffer, Pro
fessor Rendtorff said. Her population is
decimated and she is facing economic
ruin. It will be many centuries before
she can regain complete adjustment.
"Germany as I saw it was like* a sick
man recovering from a long and fright
ful illness. He is well enough to be
interested in the things in the sick room
but not strong enough to care for events
in the street." Professor Rendtorff said
Germany is interested in her own recon
struction, but may never again be feared
as a menace in outside affairs. The new
political machine, he said, is naturally
not as efficient as the old. It creaks and
drags, but it holds together and it works.
The question as to whether Germany
will remain unified or will dissolve can
not be answered with absolute certainty,
lie explained.
Professor Rendtorff devoted the lat
ter part of his lecture to a discussion of
his tour through Germany and described
the desolate condition of sections of the
country. The suffering of the middle
classes, he said, is pitiful, in spite of the
placid surface of their life, and
bers of underfed children and suffering
and penniless students is appalling. He
described the tremendous work done
there by Hoover and by relief societies.

government and places his confidence in
the German people and their constitu
tion. Bolshevism l\e considers the worst
enemy of Germany at the present time,
but believes that this movement will
never bccome. strong enough to be a real
menace.
Germany is still suffering from the
war, and will continue to suffer, Pro
fessor Rendtorff said. Her population is
decimated and she is facing economic
ruin. It will be many centuries before
she can regain complete adjustment.
"Germany as I saw it was like* a sick
man recovering from a long and fright
ful illness. He is well enough to be
interested in the things in the sick room
but not strong enough to care for events
in the street." Professor Rendtorff said
Germany is interested in her own recon
struction, but may never again be feared
as a menace in outside affairs. The new
political machine, he said, is naturally
not as efficient as the old. It creaks and
drags, but it holds together and it works.
The question as to whether Germany
will remain unified or will dissolve can
not be answered with absolute certainty,
lie explained.
Professor Rendtorff devoted the lat
ter part of his lecture to a discussion of
his tour through Germany and described
the desolate condition of sections of the
country. The suffering of the middle
classes, he said, is pitiful, in spite of the
placid surface of their life, and
bers of underfed children and suffering
and penniless students is appalling. He
described the tremendous work done
there by Hoover and by relief societies.
