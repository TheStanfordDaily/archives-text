Wednesday of next week has been
set aside by the university authorities
as a holiday, in order to fittingly com
memorate the memory of Senator and
Mrs. Stanford, the founders of the uni
versity.
That the day may most fittingly be
observed, Professor Bassett, together
with his committee on Public Exer
cises, has arranged a varied and com
prehensive program to occupy most of
the day.
At 10 o'clock in the morning an all
university assembly will be held in
the Assembly Hall. The following
program will be given at that time:
Overture University Band
Address—"How the Endowment Was
Saved" David Starr Jordan
Selection—"My CJountry" Koerner
Glee Club
Address—"The Bystander's View of
Stanford".. Rev. Willard B. Thorp
I)r. Jordan will discuss those dark
days when the school's endowment —
and through it, the school itself —was
in danger of extinction. It will call
those days Which were so fraught with
impending disaster back again to the
minds of the "old guard" and to old
residents of this vicinity. The story
of the law suit by contrast reveals the
remarkable development of Stanford
in recent years.
Rev. Thorp has just recently been
called to the pulpit of the First Con
gregationel Church in Palo Alto from
a similar position at San Diego, and
it is expected that he will present a
upon t!ie subject.
