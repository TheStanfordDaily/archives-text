# PS-S-S-T! TURNING OF WORM GETS THE EARLY RISING BIRD
## 
### 
Pss-t!! The Worm Turneth Again.
Unheralded and / unsung the annual
edition of Pss-t appeared on the cam
pus this morning in its guise og pas
sionate green, throwing co-ed defiance
to the "fifteen hundred" from every
nook and corner of its sheet.
Few of the campus celebrities es
caped attention from the editor of the
"co-ed" razz sheet. The old proverb
telling us about the early bird getting
flie worm is reversed in the verdant
sheet. The worm seems to be getting
the early bird and a few of them rose
late. The upper lip, the upper story
the Upper Division have not been
spared by the tomahawk.
Numerous wily dimes were coaxed
from their lairs in the jeans of several
hundred of those subjected to attack
this morning by representatives of
.the journalistic lawn.
A P.-S. calls attention to the fact
that the "guys htat didn't rate a razz"
would be staging a come-back. No
body was omitted.
