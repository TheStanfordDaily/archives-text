# TEMPLETON SHAPES MEN FOR SATURDAY INTER-CLASS MEET
## Track Mentor Looks for Good Marks to be Set in Annual Clash of Stanford Classes 
### 
Track Coach "Dink" Templeton put
his charges through their last hard
workout of the week this afternoon in
preparation for the annual inter-class
meet set for Saturday morning at 10:30.
Competitive races were run both last
night and tonight, and after all the men
had gone over their distances, Temple
ton called workouts Over until Saturday.
The meet Saturday will he the last
preliminary affair of the season. The
Olympic Club meets the Varsity here
on March 12, and the freshmen are
scheduled to compete with one of the
bay high schools on the same day.
Templeton looks far some good marks
to be set in the class meet Saturday
morning, and he expects to get a better
line on any new material that has come
to the front since last week's workouts.
Varsity prospects against California
are already the topic f<?r considerable
campus discussion. Most of the dope
sters already grant the Bears the 4*WJ,
880, mile, high jump, shot, broad jump,
and the relay. Stanford is sure of the
sprints unless Captain Morris Kirksey
breaks a leg between now and the big
meet, the javelin if Manner is in last
year's form, and both hurdles. The
two-mile, the discus, and the pole vault
are classed as doubtful events.
Much of Stanford's chances of win
ning the big meet seem to rest on the
versatile Kirksey and Templeton's knack
of developing second- and third-place
winners. Kirksey is sure to annex ten
markers in the dashes, and his work in
the discus and the broad jump during
the rest of the season will lie watched
with anx'iety. as it is in these events that
the Cardinals have a chance to take
points from the highly touted "Brick'
Mullet".
