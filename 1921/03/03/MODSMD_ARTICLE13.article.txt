# ARMY TEAM LOSES TO CARDINAL NINE BY 10 TO 4 SCORE
## Seay Uses Three Pitchers in Practice Struggle Against Players from Ft. McDowell 
### 
Coach Seay's ball tossers won their
second game of the season from thp
soldiers of Ft. McDowell, yesterday
afternoon on the local diamond, by a
score of 10 to 4. The visiting nine
appeared to be fairly strong at the
start but their catcher weakened, and
then the pitcher went, to pieces after
half the doughboys from the station
had taken a whirl at back-stopping.
Meanwhile, the varsity was enjoying
a regular field day, making ten runs
and perpetrating everything in the
baseball book on the army men.
George Green started on the mound
and pitched four innings of high-class
baseball.j He allowed but two hits
and not a man crossed the plate.
Green is rapidly developing into a
pitcher ol" merit and he shows more
stuff every time he takes the hill.
Haley, who throws from the port
side, succeeded Green in the fifth
frame, but he was erratic, walking
the bases full. Nef was sent to the
rescue and managed to pull out with
but two runs. Nef pitched nice ball
for the balance of the game. He al
lowed Ft. McDowell two more hits
and as many runs during his stay in
the box.
Mitchell featured around the second
hassock with some good fielding and
managed to cop off the batting hon
ors again. Saturday, he batted from
the lee side of the pentagon and man
aged to collect two blows, so yester
day he changed over to the right side
and only made a home run, a two
base hit, and scored four runs in three
official times at bat. At the rate he
is going now it looks as if Crowe and
Kline who were the leading sluggers
last year will have to look to their
laurels.
The Stanford nine shapes up more
like a real ball team each time they
start. The fact that they made ten .
runs on but six bingles indicates some
wide-awake baserunning,. and the
team is putting t*p a snappy game in
the field.
The soldiers used a tall left-hander
by the name of Knipe ami he pitched
some pretty baseball, but his catchers
kept him in hot water during most of
the game.
