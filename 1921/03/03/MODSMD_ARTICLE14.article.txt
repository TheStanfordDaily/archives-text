## 
### 
Anxiety on the campus over the fate
of Dr. Frank A. Golder, who is gather
ing material for the Hoover War Col
lection, lest he had been in Tiflis when
it was captured recently by the Bol
sheviks, was releived today by a cable
gram announcing that Golder is safe in '
Constantinople.
Dr. Golder is moving around Europe
making purchases for the collection of
war documents, particularly as they
touch upon food questions, which are
being gathered at Stanford. The last
heard from him on the campus was
that he had gone from Constantinople
to Tiflis by way of Batoum, and it was
feared th&t he was in Tiflis at the time
of its capture. Today, however, a mes
sage announcing his safety reached Stan
ford, having been relayed through
James A. Logan, head of the Children's
Relief in Paris, to the New York offices
of the relief organization, and then to
Stanford.
