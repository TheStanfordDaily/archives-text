# CABBAGES AND THINGS
## 
### 
With tltyj squirming and turning: of
the worm comes a desire on the part
of the Cahbage worm to help along
the hisses. •
* * »
Having turnec/'again, the worm must
bask in the position it held before the
apparance of the hold-up on the cam
pus this a.m. Go ahead and squirm
if you like and use another year in
putting out a hisst, but we can't see
where we'll bite for ten cents again.
* * *
It can& be that the worm turned
because it was stepped on by those it
aims at accurately.
* * *
Is it possible that all this squirm
ing was caused by being stepped on
by the recipients of the razz?
* * *
There's the bookworm, the army
worm, the angleworm, and the worm-'
gear, but the turning worm is certain-j
ly hundred per cent bait.
* * #
We don't mind being fish, but it's
tough have to part with the phen-1
nings to get hooked.

Trust a worm to try to slip out of
things. They razz the whole campus, i
by group and by individual, and say
"king's ex" on the come-back. Now
you tag me.
* * *
Little maiden, don't be peeved,
Don't be saddened, don't be grieved,
Don't call the engineers galoots
When they pass without salutes.
Before you judge ferociously
Think well of reciprocity.
All this world's bought with a price,
If gallantry yqu want, be nice,
Flounce not past with look command
ing,
Salaams and bows and pomp demand
ing,
Graceful ways prompt men to grace,
Cheer us and set the boys a pace.
Ye ed. has been asked to explain so
many of his jokes recently that he is
going to give up the Colyum in the
near future and conduct a research
and seminar on back humor.

The ntfcnager of the Quad was
speaking of "deleterious effects" the
other day. Now that he's taken up
lake sports, at night, we wonder if
Delia Torious. or whatever her name
was, has anything to do with it.

Had a baseball game yesterday.
Yeah. Lotta folks didn't know it and
dcn't yet. Stick around and I'll tell
you something about it.
* * *
The boys from the Fort were com
prised of eight people in baseball
! suits and a darkboy, who played short
[ stop.
* * #
Duffy called "heads up" when the
i darkie walloped at the ball. When he
| missed, the bleachers bawled, "Thumbs
| down." Ue should have called tails.
* * -i
When Wayland hit to right field, the
! 'leachers roared —both of 'em.
* * *
, Talk about turnin' the "dark clouds
j inside out," Crowe gave the inkbottle
i shortstop reason for that little per
formance when a ball went through
where shortstop should have been.
* * *
The doughboys' had a de
termined chin. He stepped on it try
j in' to pick up a grass-cutter.
* * *
What's the need for that whale
j sized fan the engineers use once in
! a sun dog? You should have seen the
j breeze kicked up by the bats last
i night.
* * *
After all, a baseball game is like the
Greek wars. If the sacrifices don't
go right, the war's lost.

A team of ball-playing preachers,
I Engaged in a game with their teach
ers;
They had but one ball.
And they all had to stall.
, When the sphere rolled under the
bleachers.
m * *
OPEN THE DOOR. THAT LETS
US OUT.
