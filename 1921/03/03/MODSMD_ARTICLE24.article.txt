# RELIEF FUND QUOTA IS SHORT ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
The campus quota of the European
; Student Relief Fund is $200 short, ac
cording to Professor Fairclough, chair-
I man of the committee in charge of the
fund. The total so far reaches only
$3,800, and it is necessary to have $4,000
before he can turn the campus contri
bution into the national fund. Profes
sor Fairclough is very anxious to call
the attention of the campus to this con
dition and hopes the response will en
I able him to send in the total quota very
soon.
Professor Fairclough will go to the j
California Agricultural School at Davis |
tomorrow to assist in the special drive I
for the Relief Fund there.
