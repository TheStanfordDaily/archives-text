"Where Lilith Dances," a hook of j
i
! poems by Darl Mcßoyle, '20, has been j
j published by Professor Charleton, of i
: Vale University, in connection with
j the Yale series of Younger Poets.
I This volume was chosen by Dr. Lewis
j from among some two hundred manu
] scripts submitted to him.
That Dr. Lewis' choice was wise is
indicated by even a brief summary of
the book. It is a collection of short
poems, many of which were written in
Scotland during 1914, and others were
written here at Stanford. Mcßoyle
has also scored several successes in
the writing of musical comedies, and
of four of his skits, including "The
Love Shop." "An Arabian Knight,"
j "The Little Cottage." and 'Tiider the
| Apple Tree," are now playing on the
j Orpheum circuit.
As a song writer he has been equ
! ally successful, and is known as the i
! author of "To Have, to Hold, and to
Love," "Bring Back Those Wonderful
| Days," "Forever is a Long, Long,
, Time," and "Something Doing Down
in Dixie." He is also writing a new
| book of poems, which will appear
| shortly.
Perhaps the most striking of all the
collections is "The Vision of Grace,"
wherein the soul is shown the why
of divine grace in a manner which
thrills the mind and leaves in the
remembrance of the reader a linger
ing doubt of bis own worth, and an
infinite belief in the majesty of the
i eternal. Mcßoyle has succeeded in
combining the grace and rapture of
poetry with the inevitable facts of
life, and has produced an effect which
bids fair to last.
The last three poems in the little
book, are constructed on the theme
of the war, and are remarkable in the
fact that Mcßoyle has chosen for his
j subject things so obvious that their
1 very obviousness has thrust them into
! obscurity. Of these, "A Blind Soldier"
j which describes the return of a sol
die now blind, to his old home, is
i one of the most pathetic in its de
, scription and yet the most hopeful
for the future of any poem that I
have read. "Russia, Sleeper of the
Ages," is full of a rugged strength
that well fits the subject. An element
of mystery creeps in that holds the
reader enthralled. "My God Forbid
It Me," tells the story of an outlaw
i who refused a drink of water when
j he was dying, because the men had
! brought it to him at the risk of life,
' saying that it is "the blood of men."
Mcßoyle, in his style and method of
| treatment has attained the results of
I more mature poets, and his poems
I show a degree of excellence and true
' feeling which is often lacking in the
i younger authors.

"Where Lilith Dances," a hook of j
i
! poems by Darl Mcßoyle, '20, has been j
j published by Professor Charleton, of i
: Vale University, in connection with
j the Yale series of Younger Poets.
I This volume was chosen by Dr. Lewis
j from among some two hundred manu
] scripts submitted to him.
That Dr. Lewis' choice was wise is
indicated by even a brief summary of
the book. It is a collection of short
poems, many of which were written in
Scotland during 1914, and others were
written here at Stanford. Mcßoyle
has also scored several successes in
the writing of musical comedies, and
of four of his skits, including "The
Love Shop." "An Arabian Knight,"
j "The Little Cottage." and 'Tiider the
| Apple Tree," are now playing on the
j Orpheum circuit.
As a song writer he has been equ
! ally successful, and is known as the i
! author of "To Have, to Hold, and to
Love," "Bring Back Those Wonderful
| Days," "Forever is a Long, Long,
, Time," and "Something Doing Down
in Dixie." He is also writing a new
| book of poems, which will appear
| shortly.
Perhaps the most striking of all the
collections is "The Vision of Grace,"
wherein the soul is shown the why
of divine grace in a manner which
thrills the mind and leaves in the
remembrance of the reader a linger
ing doubt of bis own worth, and an
infinite belief in the majesty of the
i eternal. Mcßoyle has succeeded in
combining the grace and rapture of
poetry with the inevitable facts of
life, and has produced an effect which
bids fair to last.
The last three poems in the little
book, are constructed on the theme
of the war, and are remarkable in the
fact that Mcßoyle has chosen for his
j subject things so obvious that their
1 very obviousness has thrust them into
! obscurity. Of these, "A Blind Soldier"
j which describes the return of a sol
die now blind, to his old home, is
i one of the most pathetic in its de
, scription and yet the most hopeful
for the future of any poem that I
have read. "Russia, Sleeper of the
Ages," is full of a rugged strength
that well fits the subject. An element
of mystery creeps in that holds the
reader enthralled. "My God Forbid
It Me," tells the story of an outlaw
i who refused a drink of water when
j he was dying, because the men had
! brought it to him at the risk of life,
' saying that it is "the blood of men."
Mcßoyle, in his style and method of
| treatment has attained the results of
