# TWO SOCCER GAMES ARE SCHEDULED FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## Varsity Meets Ironworkers While Legion Eleven Plays Soccerites of Olympic Club 
### 
Two games will be on the bill for
the soccer tan here this coining Sat
urday, both to be staged on Stanford
fields. The varsity will meet the
Union Iron Works team from San
Francisco on the tart' lield. The Palo
Alto post of the American Legion has
succeeded in having its game with
the Olympic Club transferred from
San Francisco to the campus, and the
game will take place on the auxiliary
field. Both contests will start at 3 in
the afternoon.
The varsity game is interesting
chiefly in the opportunity it affords
for comparing the brand of soccer
played by the universities with that
shown by the Sunday League teams
from the city. The Iron Works eleven
finished well in San Francisco league,
this season, and will without doubt
give Captain Newlands and his men
a hard fight. There seems no reason,
however, why the team that won the
University league championship should
be defeated by them unless something
unforeseen occurs.
The same line-up that the varsity
has used in its last few games will
be on the field Saturday, barring in
juries or sickness. Indications are
that the Iron Works team will be
practically the same that it has been
throughout the present season.
The American Legion team, the
same one that has been playing San
Francisco teams during the last few
weeks, goes up against a tough propo- 1
sition in the Olympic Club, which was i
the runner-up in the championship. I
The Legionites stepped in to fill the
breach left by the delinquency of the j
Columbia Club, and have been show- j
ing up very well. The great number !
of ex-Stanford players on the team
will attract interest in the coming
battle. '
