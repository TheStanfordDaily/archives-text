# DR. BADE GIVES WORLD PROBLEMS FORUM TALK
## Speaker Claims Bible to Be Book of Hebrew Folklore; Questions from Audience 
### 
The last meeting of the World
Problems Forum, for this quarter,
held under the auspices of the Y. IVI.
0. A., was addressed last night by
Dean William F. Bade, of the Pacific
School of Religion, on the subject,
"Where has Historical Criticism Led
the Bible?" After the lecture, ques
tions were asked by the audience for
the purpose of clearing up some of
the speaker's statements concerning
so vital a subject.
Dr. Bade stated that only good has
been accomplished by the develop
ment of the investigation of biblical
statements upon a historical basis,
because a careful reader of the scrip
tures can not avoid discovering flatly
contradictory statements and is gen
erally at a loss when he tries to ac
count for the discrepancy. The fact
that the document extends over a
thousand years of piecemeal contri
bution explains the different view
points and purposes of the books. In
reality the Bible is Hebrew folk-lore.
The purpose of the field of historical
criticism is to determine the authenti
city of the history and its chronology.
Many of the statements are contradic
tory and only from a histological sur
vey can their relative importance as
truth be determined. For instance,
the first reference to the crossing of
the Dead Sea explains the miracle as
a natural phenomena, a very low tide
and a strong wind. The next few
hundred years saw the necessity of a
new version, to serve the needs of the
theories of the time, so a miraculous
significance is attached with is even
more marked in a later interpretation.
Historical comparison of the contex
of the adjacent material in respect
to its references to the political, so
cial and religious life of the nation and
neighboring nations is the only guide
to authenticity besides the differences
in the language in which the scrip
tures are written.
The two sets of commandments il
lustrate the contradictory ambiguity
of the Bible. The first set serves the
social purpose the nomads
together as opposed to the agricultur
ists and are anything but spiritual, in
contrast to the teaching of the ten
tablets of Moses that are generally
accepted as inspired.
Sincerity characterized the address
of Dean Bade, and he was especially
clear in answering the many questions
that were asked in respect to every
thing from methods of teaching to a
definition of God, for which he gave
the following:
"The unity of a people's highest
ideals."
