# Young Adventurers Get Trip to Southern City
## 
### 
Seeking a glimpse of the world out
side, but weary from a seventeen-mile
hike from San Francisco to Burlingame,
two young adventurers, Arnold Tucker,
7j% and Earl Stephens, wandered up
Palm Drive late Monday night, mis
taking it, they said, for the road to San
Jose. Before they had progressed very
far they encountered a group of stu
dents to whom they explained that they
were in search of their mother in San
Jose.
The kind-hearted students, believing
their story, placed the youngsters on an
autobus bound for the Garden City.
Taken in charge by an qfficer upon their
arrival there about midnight, the boys
confessed that they had left San Fran
cisco that morning with the idea of see
ing for themselves what the world was
really like. They had been given a "lift"
from Burlingame to Palo Alto where
they encountered unexpected aid from
the students.
