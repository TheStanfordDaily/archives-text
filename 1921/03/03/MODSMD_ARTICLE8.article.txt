# EUPHRONIA WINS IN ANNUAL CLASH WITH NESTORIANS
## Winning Trio, Landels, Durand and Hirschfeld Argue for Maintaining Penalty 
### 
Euphronia won for the twenty
fourth time the annual forensic clash
between Nestoria and Euphronia de
bating societies, held in Room- 12 of ;
the Law Building, last night, taking
the negative of the question: "Re
solved. That capital punishment for
first-degree murder be abolished in*the-i
State of California. "Judges, Profes-1
sors Whittier and Kirkwood of the I
Law department, and Professor Bas
sett of the English department, were!
unanimous in their decision in favor
of Euphronia.
B. E. McCaffery, '24, who proved to |
be Nestoria's ablest speaker, opened
the debate for the affirmative by stat
ing three facts in support of his propo
sition, first, that capital punishment
was out of accord with present-day
humanitarian views, second, the fact i
that capital punishment does not re- j
tard crime, and third, that capital '
punishment is a wastage, an idea,
based on the vengeance of society, and j
prevents all chance of reform.
In making the first speech for the
negative, Ellis Hirschfeld, '20, empha
sized the point that the California law,
providing for life imprisonment or the |
death penalty at the option of the
jury, had all the advantage of the life
imprisonment system', with tPe added
advantage of the deterrent effect of
the fear of death in the prevention of
cold-blooded murder.'
S. R. Dows, '22, the second speaker j
for the affirmative, made the state-!
pjont tha> it if the certanty of pur !
ishment and not the severity which!
deters the criminal, and cited statist- i
ics to prove that more convictions are
secured in the states having life im
prisonment as the highest penalty.
At the conclusion of his argument
Hirsc hfp Id of the opposition asked him
a question, which was, however, re
ferred to the rebuttal by McCaffery.
As the second speaker on ,the nega- j
tive, H. J. Durafld, '24, said that capital
punishment was necessary to make the |
fear of punishment a sufficient pre-j
ventive to the criminal, and that the
duty of the stftte is first to protect th 6
lives of law-abiding citizens, more
than to protect the lives of murderers.;
The last Nestoria speaker, S. G.
Trimble, '22, took as his point the
statement that the really efficient law
is the one which reforms, not merely
punishes, and stated that the death of
a man left no chance for the reforma
tion and subsequent usefullness to
society which might occur in the case
of life imprisonment with a possibility
of pardon.
E. D. Landels, '21, in making the
final speech for the negative, char
acterized himself by his wit and elo
quence as the leading Euphronia
speaker. He said that the natural
avenue of progress was to reserve the
death penalty for murder, as the
value of human life over property
rose, and that whilo the state owes
a duty to the "criminal to reform him,
it owes a greater duty to protect the
innocent public.
L. B. Martin. '22, the president of
i the Euphronia Society, presid' '
I the meeting, which was nttor
| a number of men from the two
! zations, as well as outsiders.
