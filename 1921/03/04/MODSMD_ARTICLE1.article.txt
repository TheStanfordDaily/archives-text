# VARSITY NINE TO PLAY OLYMPICS IN THIRD GAME
## Draper and Bundy are Chosen by Seay to Open Contest on Local Diamond at 3:30 
### 
Coach Seay's nine will meet the Olym
pic Club in the third game of the sea
son on the local diamond at 3 :30 tomor
row afternoon. The game should be
fast and bring out real ball playing on
both sides at the dopesters concede the
Olympics a good line-up this year. The
Cardinal team has two victories to its
credit so far and will meet the visitors
with strong intentions of evening up the
victory which the Winged-0 club took
home with it last year.

Draper and Bundy will start the game
with Kelly in reserve for the job on the
mound. The infield will work the same
as in the two previous games with Pat
terson at first, Mitchell guarding the
keystone territory, Heckendorf in his
stamping ground around third, and Kal
lam nabbing the bounders coming his
way at short.

Kline, Wayland, Crowe, and Carver
will divide honors in the outfield. These
men have been dealing out a high grade
of bnll playing both in the field and at
the plate, with Kline and Crowe holding
a slight edge on stick work. Carver has
been packing a bad knee for the last
few days, which may keep him out of
the game. Fd Morrissey or Augie Jotin
son will take the mound for the Olym
pics with Jimmy Riordan taking the
throws. These men are rated as vet
erans, and with a strong team behind
them will make the Cardinal work for
their tallies.
