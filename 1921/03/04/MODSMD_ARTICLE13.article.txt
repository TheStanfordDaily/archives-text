# COURT GAME TOMORROW DECIDES CARD-BRUIN SERIES
## CAGE SUPREMACY OF PACIFIC COAST HINGES UPON OUTCOME OF CONTEST Lou Foley of Los Angeles will Referee Final Battle; Powell Says Team Ready for Whistle 
### 
Lou Foley, of Los Angeles, will be the eleventh man on the court tomor
row night when the basketball varsities of California and Stanford claÂ»h in
the third game of their annual series, and the deciding game of the Pacific
Coast Conference, in the Oakland Auditorium. Foley is well-known in the
south as a football and basketball coach, and officiated in the game between
Stanford and U. S. C. grid teams last fall. He was chosen because the man
agers deemed it advisable to have an outsider handle the crucial game.
Foley has been recommended as a very capable official.
Coach Walter Powell has been putting the squad through light workouts
this week and he expresses himself as well pleased with their fitness. The

quintet will go into battle with the
usual men on the job and fighting
hard. This last week of practice has
put the men in better condition than
they were when they defeated the
Blue and Gold aggregation last week,
and they feel fully confident that they
can repeat their victory on a neutral
court.
Righter and Davies are slated to
begin in the game at forwards. Both
of these men have been playing stellar
ball all season and they are counted
on to do the bulk of the Cardinal
scoring against the Berkeleyites.
Bert Mills, who suffered from minor in
juries during the northern tour, is
entirely recovered and prepared to
play his best game of the year at
center. Dick Richmond will handle
the running guard job and may be
counted oh to contribute one or two
spectacular shots when the going gets
close. Captain Adams will play stand
ing guard, and those who saw his work
against the speedy California forward
last Saturday know that his end of
the court will be well cared for.

Opposing this five, Coach Wight
will start his regular line-up, consist
ing of Coop and Douthit, forwards;
Larkey, center; Eggleston, Symes,
and LeHane guards.
Both of these teams are determined
to play their hardest to take this, the
third game of the series. If Stanford
wins it will mar the claim of the Cali
fornia team to the Conference cham
pionship as both teams will then have
lost three games hut the Cardinal will
have defeated the Blue and Gold five
two out of three games. This game
is regarded by both Graduate Man
agers as a conference game, and in
the event of a Stanford victory the
title of each team will he equal, and
a third game will be necessary.

Because of these facts it is the de
sire of Coach Powell that every Stan
ford man and woman who can pos
sibly get to Oakland on Saturday
night shall be at the Auditorium, when
the teams go on the floor, to cheer
the red-jerseyed players on. There
are plenty of seats to accommodate all
who care to go and every Stanford
rooter who attends will enhance the
team's chances, which now are exceed
ingly bright, through his presence in
the Stanford rooting section.

Tbe Oakland court is about the
same size as Encina Gymnasium
floor, the only difference being that
the baskets are set upon the floor
supports instead of being suspended.
Ample floor space is provided bo that
there will be 110 difficulty over spec
tators being on or over the lines.

Manager "Wash" Connolly an
nounces that tickets will be placed
on sale in the Administration Build
ing tomorrow morning from 9 to 11
so that all those who are going, hut
were unable to get to the seat sale
this afternoon, may procure the paste
boards. The price of the tickets is
35 cents to holders of student body
cards and $1 to outsiders. The gamo
is scheduled to start promptly irt 8
o'clock.
