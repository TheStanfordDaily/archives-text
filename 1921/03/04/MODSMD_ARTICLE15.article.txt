# ONE WAY TO WIN
## 
### 
Coach Powell's men are ready. Were they to meet the California
five at Oakland tomorrow night behind closed doors we have no doubt as
to which team would set the pace.
But California's decided advantage lies in her having 10,000 students
at hand to pour into the auditorium. Should the game be one of those
nerve-racking contests, and should California near the end of the second
half develop a slight rally, all of the Berkeley thousands together will be
vocally backing and mentally backing the Blue and Gold with all their
mo nil courage. Basketball men believe this a tremendous force to tight
in any close battle.
Stanford men who are with Coach Powell's five in its attempt to
bring another coast basketball championship to the farm will make sure
that the Cardinal stands at Oakland are prepared to combat any force
California's thousands may be able to exert. The Stanford team should
not lack the kind of support it must have to set the pace that means
victory.
