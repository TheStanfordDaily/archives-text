# DEBATING HONORS
## 
### 
Pacific Coast debating honors will be decided this evening. Two
speakers from the University of Washington will side against Robert
Hinckley, '19, and Vernon Green, '21, on the strike question at the Little
Theatre tonight. In the north Paul F. Erickson, '21, and David rannen
baum, '22, compete against the University of Oregon. Washington and
Oregon debate at Seattle. The university whose two teams secure the
largest judges' vote takes the Pacific League championship.
Coach Miller McClintock has developed a team of reputed clever
ness in debating tactics to take the stage platform at the Little Theatre,
and Washington's men, who easily defeated Princeon, are unusually well
prepared.
This evening's contest should furnish an immediate clash ot keen
wits and is well worth consideration of the student body.
