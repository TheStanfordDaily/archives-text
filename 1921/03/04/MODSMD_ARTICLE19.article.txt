# APPOINTMENT OFFICE HAS GROWN UNDER MRS. SNELL
## 
### 
There are few more interesting ways
of spending an hour on the campus than
stealing some of Mrs. Elizabeth Burritt
Snell's valuable time. For although the
appointment office may seem to have no
particular attraction except for business
purposes, it is one of the most human'
spots at Stanford.
"Our duty in this office," says Mrs.
Snell, "is to mother Stanford students —
and to use a little more common sense
in doing it than most mothers use."
For there is more to the work of an
appointment secretary than merely plac
ing men and women in positions. Both
the employer and the students must be
taken into consideration in a number of
ways. Mrs. Snell had made it her busi
ness to become a personal friend of
every student who comes to her for aid
—and there were 1,100 of these last year
alone.
She must know more than the work
of her own office—she must know in
general the work of the newspaper man,
the physicist, the secretary, the sales
man. For she must pick men and wom
en for these positions and must know
what qualifications are necessary.
The Stanford appointment office is an
example of efficiency. It contains re
markable cataloguing systems and files—
but the most remarkable of all of these
is the brain of Elizabeth Snell, the guid
ing force of the office.
One of the reasons why she is espe
cially fitted for this work is that Mrs.
Snell has gone through it all herself.
She knows the difficulties of securing a
position, and she knows the requirements
of that position after it has once been
secured. During her last year in col
lege. Mrs, Snell did all kinds of student
work, and since her graduation she lias
been employed in the offices of lawyers,
engineers, doctors, insurance men, and
has spent one year teaching English and
business subjects in night school.
Elizabeth Burritt graduated from
<s. a>

Stanford in 1908 after having majored
in the Latin and Zoology departments,
and studied business subjects for one
year at the Polytechnic Business College
in Oakland, taking some graduate work
in court reporting.
She had intended being a teacher,
more because it was the proper thing for
young women to do than for any other
reason, but circumstances led to her tak
ing up secretarial work, which was not at
up secretarial work, which was not at
that time as fashionable as it is today.
Mrs. Snell was one of the pioneers in the
field and was characterized by Mrs. May
Cheney, appointment secretary at the
University of California, as being the
only graduate of either of the state uni
versities who was then really qualified
for such work.
The appointment office was tempo
rarily in charge of the late Professor
Show following the departure of Susan
Bristol, when Mrs. Snell was asked to
come here in 1916 and was thouhgt of
then by the students as practically noth
ing more than a place for making ap
pointments to talk with the President
of the University. Tti her five years
here, the appointment secretary has built
the office up to strong position which it
now holds in the life of Stanford.
Tn vocational conferences on matters
of teaching and business alone as a part
of her duty as a member of the Voca
tional Guidance Committee of the Fac
ulty! Mrs. Snell talked with sixty-eight
students last year, and it would be im
possible to number the others with whom
she has come in contact.
It is interesting to watch her with a
phone at 'each ear, talking to her assist
ants and a visitor at one time and suc
cessfully doing each. Everything about
Mrs. Snelh and her office is practiacl.
She is a business woman. But more
than that, she is human, and a worthy
friend for any Stanford man or woman
to cultivate.

been employed in the offices of lawyers,
engineers, doctors, insurance men, and
has spent one year teaching English and
business subjects in night school.
Elizabeth Burritt graduated from
<s. a>

Stanford in 1908 after having majored
in the Latin and Zoology departments,
and studied business subjects for one
year at the Polytechnic Business College
in Oakland, taking some graduate work
in court reporting.
She had intended being a teacher,
more because it was the proper thing for
young women to do than for any other
reason, but circumstances led to her tak
ing up secretarial work, which was not at
up secretarial work, which was not at
that time as fashionable as it is today.
Mrs. Snell was one of the pioneers in the
field and was characterized by Mrs. May
Cheney, appointment secretary at the
University of California, as being the
only graduate of either of the state uni
versities who was then really qualified
for such work.
The appointment office was tempo
rarily in charge of the late Professor
Show following the departure of Susan
Bristol, when Mrs. Snell was asked to
come here in 1916 and was thouhgt of
then by the students as practically noth
ing more than a place for making ap
pointments to talk with the President
of the University. Tti her five years
here, the appointment secretary has built
the office up to strong position which it
now holds in the life of Stanford.
Tn vocational conferences on matters
of teaching and business alone as a part
of her duty as a member of the Voca
tional Guidance Committee of the Fac
ulty! Mrs. Snell talked with sixty-eight
students last year, and it would be im
possible to number the others with whom
she has come in contact.
It is interesting to watch her with a
phone at 'each ear, talking to her assist
ants and a visitor at one time and suc
cessfully doing each. Everything about
Mrs. Snelh and her office is practiacl.
She is a business woman. But more
than that, she is human, and a worthy
friend for any Stanford man or woman
to cultivate.

There are few more interesting ways
of spending an hour on the campus than
stealing some of Mrs. Elizabeth Burritt
Snell's valuable time. For although the
appointment office may seem to have no
particular attraction except for business
purposes, it is one of the most human'
spots at Stanford.
"Our duty in this office," says Mrs.
Snell, "is to mother Stanford students —
and to use a little more common sense
in doing it than most mothers use."
For there is more to the work of an
appointment secretary than merely plac
ing men and women in positions. Both
the employer and the students must be
taken into consideration in a number of
ways. Mrs. Snell had made it her busi
ness to become a personal friend of
every student who comes to her for aid
—and there were 1,100 of these last year
alone.
She must know more than the work
of her own office—she must know in
general the work of the newspaper man,
the physicist, the secretary, the sales
man. For she must pick men and wom
en for these positions and must know
what qualifications are necessary.
The Stanford appointment office is an
example of efficiency. It contains re
markable cataloguing systems and files—
but the most remarkable of all of these
is the brain of Elizabeth Snell, the guid
ing force of the office.
One of the reasons why she is espe
cially fitted for this work is that Mrs.
Snell has gone through it all herself.
She knows the difficulties of securing a
position, and she knows the requirements
of that position after it has once been
secured. During her last year in col
lege. Mrs, Snell did all kinds of student
work, and since her graduation she lias
been employed in the offices of lawyers,
engineers, doctors, insurance men, and
has spent one year teaching English and
