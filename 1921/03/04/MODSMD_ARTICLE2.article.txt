# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL AT MILLS TOMORROW PROMISES FAST GAME
## 
### 
The junior and sophomore women's
basketball teams will play the upper and
lower-class sevens of Mills College to
morrow morning at 10 at Mills in the
first interclass intercollegiate game this
season. The teams will leave Palo Alto
at 7:11 in order to connect with the 8:20
boat to Oakland. Since it will be pos
sible for rocrters to take the next train
and still be in time for the game, it is
hoped that there will be a good repre
sentation on the side lines.
Both juniors and sophomores are
champions in their divisions, the juniors
having defeated the seniors last Tues
day and the sophomores the freshmen
yesterday. The juniors stand undefeat
ed so far in the interclass series and the
sophomores have lost but one game in
the finals. Both teams arc consistent in
their passing and team work and should
stand a very good chance against the
Mills sevens.
The line-up for tomorrow is:
Juniors: Forwards, M. Younglove. T.
Aten, L. Tavernetti: guards, D. Steven
sen. M. Dwight, B. Vaughan; touch
center, C. Bailard; side crtTters, M. Ford.
