New Lighting Effects
English Club is introducing many j
, novel features in this "Yellow Jacket," j
j according to ye ed. and there's a new
1 one: A special 12:00 o'clock rehearsal j
> for lighting effects, and there's the
j point—they are getting them. Ernest
I Greppin is the father of these syncri
| sizing ideas, and has to his credit
j some professional experience obtained
,in Los Angeles. The most lights and
color are combined in some really re
-1 markable effects, that will surprise
the campus into thinking they under
stand Chinese.
What's the Delay?
The Junior Opera Committee is
i still arguing over the best of the ten
j submitted operas. We understand
i that the name was to be announced
i the first of this week, now we are
! curious. Come 011, don't keep us
guessing.
"Lies, and lies, and lies!"
Ha! We have another one of those
gripping, gasping, gurgling dramas,
advertised at the Stanford Theatre
this week. It dies out tonight, but
we have a matinee and two evening
performances ahead of us. "Lying
Lips" is the terrible name of this
| "drama of Life and Love."
; Movie Censorship
Even the Editor of the Examiner
has taken up this little matter of
movie censorship, and judging from
his Editorial in the Thursday edition,
we surmise that he is again it. We
'on't like that "Blue Law" idea either,
but are not averse to a little tactful
discrimination as long as we have to
pay our thirty cents before voicing
our opinion.
