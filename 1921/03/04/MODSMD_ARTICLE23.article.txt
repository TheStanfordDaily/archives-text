# FRESHMAN DEBATERS WILL TRYOUT MONDAY
## 
### 
The try-outs for the freshman debate
with California will be held Monday at
3:00 o'clock, in the Little Theatre. This
is the first debate of this kind that has
ever been held, and Coacli MeClintock is
especially anxious to beat the challeng
ers if for this fact alone.
The question that will be used in the
try-out is, "Resolved, that the use of the
injunction in labor disputes should be
prohibited in the United States." Hither
side of the question may be argued.
W. R. Gage, '24, appointed by the
freshman to act as manager, has ar
ranged for a simutaneous debate, the
two negatives speaking at California on
the same night that the affirmative is de
fended at Stanford by the other half of
the team. Mr. McClintock has consent
ed to coach this team as well as the reg
ular debaters and will judge the try
outees Monday.
Kvcry freshman who has ever heard
a debate is asked to be sure and appear
with a speech for this tryout.
