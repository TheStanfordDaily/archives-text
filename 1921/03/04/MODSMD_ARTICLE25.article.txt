# Varsity Chess Team Is Defeated by Runnymede Players in Close Meets
## 
### 
The varsity Chess Team was de
feated last night by the Itunnymede
aggregation, for the first time. Con
siderable interest was shown in the
meet as many enthusiasts gathered
from Palo Alto and nearby towns.
Chess critics claim that the Stanford
defeat was dun to lack of practice
and the added strength of the opposi
tion as well as to the absence of some
of the varsity's stars.
The Runnymede men had on their'
line-up several well known chees play
ers, such as Dunipace, Weeks and
Bell. The contests were hard fought
and close victories resulted.
The score of the tournament fol
lows:â€”Mandl, (S), lost to Dunipace;
Coblentz, (S), won from Goldfelter,
Captain Mueller (S) lost to Captain
Weeks; E. Jordan. (S) lost to White;
