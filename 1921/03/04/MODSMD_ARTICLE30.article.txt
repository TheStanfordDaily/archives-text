# DUO DE KEREKJARTO, VIOLIN VIRTUOSO, THE NEXT HEALY ARTIST

I
Duci de Kerekjarto, the young Hun
garian violin virtuoso, who will appear
in recital under Frank W. Healey's
Tuesday night, March
15, in the Assembly Hall, has a name
that seems almost unpronounceable
to those not acquainted with that
most difficult of all Central European
languages, Hungarian. But it is not
as difficult as it looks, for phonetically
it is "Kerek-yahr-to." It is the name
of a young Hungarian violinist who
has recently been creating a sensa
tion on the European continent and
who made his American debut at Car
negie Hall on the evening of Novem
ber 2.
Kerekjarto arrived quietly for one
already famous, as he is barely twenty
years old. He has been acclaimed by
critics and public of most of the im
portant musical centers of Europe,
and is a recipient of numerous decora
tions and diplomas. Commencing to
play at the early age of three, en
couraged by his father, an amateur
musician and professor of engineer
ing at the University of Budapest, he
was a prize pupil of Hubay when he
reached eleven and a half years. From
a "child wonder" he has developed
into a matured and finished player,
able to satisfy the severest critics and
to arouse his audiences to enthusi
asm.
