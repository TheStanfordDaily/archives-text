# NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER CHANGE IN FOOTBALL RULES
## 
### 
The National Intercollegiate Foot
ball Rules Committ.ee will hold itß un
nual meeting tomorrow in New York
City, to discuss probable changes in
the playing code that governs football
as played as a major sport in most
of the colleges of the United States.
One of the questions to come up
will be the point of retaining or abo
lishing the goal kick after a touch
down. This is a time-honored fea
ture of the gridiron game, but was
retained last year only after heated
debate by some of the older members
of the committee. Two important
games in the Western Conference were
won and lost last fall due to failure
to kick goal after a touch-down.
Some members suggested last year
that the attempt be made from scrim
mage. the same as a field goal. This
was nearly adopted but members
raised the point that the defending
team would have an advantage of
eleven members to block the kick
while the offending team would have
only nine members. Observers of the
ame suggest that the idea could be
adopted with a provision that two
members of the defending team should
be removed during the play, in order
to equalize the strength of the op
posing team.
Last year, Glenn Warner, one of
the leading foot-ball coaches in the
country, asserted that the big teams
were getting too far away from the
kicking game; and emphasized the
necessity of developing more talent
ilong this line.
The committee may also take some
action against the forward pass. In
case of tie games the suggestion of
an eastern official that the teams play
an extra period should be given some
consideration.
