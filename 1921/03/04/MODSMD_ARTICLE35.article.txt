# TENNIS CHAMPIONS TO GIVE EXHIBITION MATCH WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
One of the added feature attractions
of Founders' Day will be exhibition ten
nis matches by William M. Johnston,
' world's doubles and thrice national
| doubles and singles champion. It will
be the first appearance of the cham
pions on the local courts and will be an
excellent opportunity for tennis enthusi
asts to see the country's best players in
action.
Willis Davis is also conceded a place
among the best racquet weilders in the
world and has a variety of strokes and
I a science rarely equalled. Johnston,
; though a small man, has an especially
j fast drive and unusual accuracy in plant
: ing the ball in the corners.
| It is planned to have several local
j players compete against the wizards in
i singles and doubles. Who these players
; will be is not yet certain, but in all
probability they will be chosen from the
following members of the varsity squad:
Jim Davies, Phil Neer, Berry Fish, and
Skee Turner.
Davies has played but few games of
tennis this season, but his experience
on the basketball court will leave him
in perfect condition, and with an infal
lible eye to drive the pellet. Davies
has, in the few times that he has played,
shown a vast improvement in style over
I that which won the California and Coast
I I intercollegiate singles and doubles chain
i pionship last year. Should Davies meet
the world's title holder, local fans may
count on an excellent display of fire
works on both sides of the net. Neer,
Turner, and Fish have also improved
their ability at the net game and can be
counted upon for a good battle if
matched against the champions.
and hitting upon suggestions
which will prevent tie games, there
is little likelihood of the committee
making any important changes other
wise.
