# Some Watch; If You Don't Think It Ask the Owners
## 
### 
Listen to this one. If you don't be
lieve it don't take anybody's word, but
ask Roy Hill, '21. Last October he
lost his Waltham watch. He offered
reward for the return, but the elusive
time piece baffled all search and re
mained lost to the ken of man.

Yesterday Pete Parrish, campus gard
ener and landscape artist, while spading
the garden of Mr. Ilill's residence on
Lasuen and working beneath the win
dows of the smoking room at the house,
turned up a dirty silver watch. He asked
if anyone owned it and Hill identified
the watch as the one he had lost five
months ago. It had been out in the rain
through the entire winter and was bur
ied under sjx inches of dirt.

The watch, wound up, runs perfectly
today and seems none the worse for its
half-year sojourn in the wet ground.
Hill says, "I don't like to brag, but you'll
have to agree with me that Waltham is
some little chronometer."
