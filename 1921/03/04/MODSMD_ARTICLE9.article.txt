# BABE NINE HAS FIRST GAME TOMORROW. 9:45
## Yearlings Play Mountain View High School in Opener of Spring Freshman Schedule 
### 
The freshman baseball team plays its
first game of the year tomorrow against
the Mountain View High School nine
on the local field at 9:45 a.m. It is
doubtful whether it will afford a \'ery
good opportunity to get a line on the
team as a whole, since the visitors are
not reputed to have a strong team.
Rough and unpolisluifii. as is the work of
the freshman nine at present, they should
beat Mountain View with a few runs to
spare.
The probable line-up is difficult to
name, as there is no doubt that there
will he a general shifting of players in
almost every position before the game
ends, in order to allow Captain Wood
ward to see how the different aspirants
work out under competition. There are
at least two men at each station that
are of inout equal class, and it will be
difficult to pick the right one without a
good deal of practice.
Selection of pitchers for tomorrow's
contest is not definite, but probabilities
are that Bonner will start in the box.
Lowenstein. Lobree, and Mertz can all
be called on if needed.
The catcher's position will be split
evenly between Huneke and Holmes,
each man playing half the game. Both
are good receivers and seem to be very
evenly matched.
The infield is beginning to look well.
Strong is the likely one to start at first
tomorrov. with Atwill and May ready to
relieve him. Either Deffenhach or Haw
kins will cover second. Captain Wood
ward will take short, while Smurr and
Dwight are the two prospects for third
base.
Leibendorfer, Collins, and Fuller are
slated to start the game in the outfield,
with Ehrhorn and Chandler in reserve.
The freshman diamond has been
cleared so that playing conditions are
somewhat better than they have been,
especially in regard to rcgrading the
ground.
A new period of the training of the
team will begin Viext Monday when
"Swede" Righter takes charge of the
coaching. A more definite line-up prob
ably will be announced under his in
struction.
