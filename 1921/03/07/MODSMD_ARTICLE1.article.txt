# HARRIET BRADFORD RESIGNS POSITION AS DEAN OF WOMEN
## Elizabeth Hogue, '01, Former Head of Stanford Nurses' School to Take Up Duties 
### 
Miss Harriet Bradford has resigned
as Dean of Women at Stanford Uni
versity, a position which she has held
since 1916, the resignation to take
effect August 1.
The President's Office in announc
ing the acceptance of her resignation
announced also that her successor in
the office will be Miss Elizabeth
Hogue, Stanford '01, who is now Sup
erintendent of Nurses of the Stanford
School of Nurses, attached to the
Medical School in San Francisco.
Miss Bradford came to Stanford as
Dean of Women the year after her
graduation from Bryn Mawr and is
now resigning in order to carry out
her ambition to pursue graduate work
in political science and law. She will
attend the University of Chicago next
year and intends to devote several
years to graduate work.
While Dean of Women at Stanford
she has, besides maintained her con
tact with the academic side of
the University, interested herself
particularly in the women's housing
problem, with regard to which the
University has worked out a plan by
which all of the women will be group
ed togethed in University residence
halls near their own athletic fields.
Miss Hogue, who will become the
Dean of Women at the beginning of
the next academic year, now holds the
rank of professor in the Stanford
faculty by virtue of her position as
Superintendent of Nurses in connec
tion with the Stanford Medical School.
Concerning her work in that capa
city, Dr. George B. Somers, Physician
Superintendent of the Medical School,
says:
"Miss Hogue has been with us dur
ing the last seven years and under
her able administration the School for
Nurses has steadily grown in import
ance and reputation until today I be
lieve it can be truthfully stated that
it has become the leading training
school on the Pacific Coast.
Ever since Miss Hogue graduated
from Stanford her work has been
largely with women of college age, in
cluding many college women and for
a portion of the time she has been
directly in touch with Stanford under
graduate women on the campus. At
Stanford she was a student in the
Physiology department. She is a
member of the Kappa Alpha Theta
sorority.
Immediately upon graduating from
Stanford she entered the hospital for
training and later went to New York
for additional professional training
and experience. After a trip to
Europe where she visited hospitals
and clinics, and a winter in New York,
she returned to Palo Alto in 1905 as
Superintendent of the Students' Guild
Hospital there. Later she organized
in Palo Alto the stock company that
built the Peninsula Hospital and es
tablished there a training school, and
was for three years superintendent
of that school, during which time she
established the 8-hour schedule for
nurses two years before the law was
passed requiring that schedule.
In 1913 she resigned and after a
year spent in a trip around the world
returned to become 1 Superintendent
of Nurses of the Stanford School of
Nursing where she has been continu
ally since, except for war service. She
organized the Nursing Corps of the
Stanford Naval Base Hospital Unit and
went over seas with that unit.
Miss Hogue will be aided in her
new position as Dean of Women by
the fact that she has always main
tained an active interest in many
lines outside of her professional life.
She has also kept in close touch with
all Stanford enterprises. During her
years in Palo Alto she kept in touch
with students not. only through those
who came to the hospital, but also
through her old college affiliations.
