## POWELL'S BASKET TEAM GETS LEAD AT OUTSET; FINAL SCORE 25 TO 21 DAVIES STARS FOR CARDINAL OFFENSE; TALLIES 17 OF 25 TWO STRAIGHT WINS FROM U.C. AT SEASON'S END GIVES CARDS EDGE Teams Tied in Games Won; Stanford is Favored Quintet of Coast 
### (By Harry J. Borba, '22 
Stanford demonstrated its basketball superiority before 10,000 people in
the Oakland Auditorium, Saturday night, by doling out a 25 to 21 defeat
to the California Bruins. For a team said to be lacking in team-work, Coach
Powell's men played a masterful brand of ball. The Blue and Gold quintet
looked like amateurs b; a comparison of team play, the department of the
game in which they were supposed to be the most proficient.
Jimmy Davies, was easily the star of the game. It was Davies who
started Stanford off in the lead by dropping three free throws through the
hoop in the first five minutes of play. In fact, he was the whole Cardinal
scoring machine in this period, making all of the nine points. Seven of the
points he made by converting fouls and the other two came from a field goal.

In the second half, as there were but
few fouls to convert he made four
field goals for a total of eight points.
Besides scoring seventeen of the
twenty-five Stanford markers Davies
amused himself by showing up Eggles
ton, California's star guard, who is
said to be the best running guard on
the coast. "Eggy" had a turbulent
time trying to trail Davies around the
court but was still more plagued when
Jimmy took to trailing him.
Stanford look the lead when Davies
scored the first point of the game on
a foul by Coop. He added two more
before California converted a foul,
making the score 3 to 1. The teams
see-sawed until near the end of the
quarter when Captain Jack Symes
dropped one through from a hard angle
making the score Beven up. Two more
California fouls converted by the di
minutive forward gave Stanford the
lead at half time â€”9 to 7.
Coming back from the ten-minute
rest period, the Powellites piled on
ton points in rapid succession through
some clever goal shooting by Mills
and Davies. Then the California five
started on a mad rampage that threw
a scare into the Cardinal supporters.
Davies was lifted from the game for
a few minutes of rest and Rogers was
sent in. Eggleston suddenly located
the and sent three in from the
floor making the score 21 to 15. Dout
hit who had relieved Captain Symes
at forward at the beginning of the
period scored four more points, bring
ing the total to 19.
Stall-play Fools
California's Bleachers
Stanford players held a consultation
in the center of the court to devise
ways and means to stop the mad rush
of their opponents. Davies was sent
back into the game fairly fresh and
rarin' to go. Thompson was sent in
by Coach Wight to replace Eggleston
who was beginning to wobble after his
three spectacular contributions to the
California total.
Referee Foley's whistle brought the
two teams into action, and Davies
celebrated his return by making an
other ringer. Mills imitated Davies
and the score was 23 to 19. Suddenly
play ceased. "Swede" Righter shook
the two men who had been trying to
dissuade him from his defensive tac
tics all evening, and stood at the side
of the court patting the teathern pellet
as if he didn't know what to do with
it. Then ho passed to Captain Adams.
Freddie received the hall with the
same lack of knowing how to dispose
of it and stood holding it. He passed
to Richmond who was likewise mysti
fied as to the next move. Mills took
the ball and after caressing it for a
