Stanford's second straight decisive win over'the University of Cali
fornia basketball five under conditions allowing each team to be at its
best undoubtedly marks the Cardinal of coast championship calibre
Though on a percentage basis California and Stanford are tied in games
won from other conference teams, the two Stanford victories at the
season's climax with both varsities at their most perfected state stamp
Coach Powell's five with a superiority no reasonable man will denv.
Contrary to general impression the Coast Conference does not pro
vide for selection of a championship team. It arranges a schedule for
the purpose of promoting harmonious competition, and not with any
idea of fixing a definite number of games at the end of which a cham
pion is chosen. Public opinion determines the best team. When Con
ference teams schedule two games, both are ordinarily figured in the
percentage column ; when four are played, all are counted: and any as
sumption that when three games are played the last should not be count
ed is based on no intention of conference schedule makers.
California and Stanford were scheduled for two games because it
was probable that a third would be unnecessary, but it was provided
that the third contest should be arranged if honors were'divided in the
first two. Any contention that the last game has no bearing on the coast
championship, that is, on the selection of the best team of the confer
ence, well displays its own absurdity.
The conference itself is the only body which could authoritatively
designate a champion, but we have the satisfaction of knowing that
such selection if made would undeniably fall to the Cardinal Varsity,
which has just twice defeated its chief rival in two decisive contests.
In appreciation of the work of Coach Powell and his men we can
merely say that through a hard season they have accomplished all that
Stanford could ask of them; and we know that the varsity is made up
of the typical clean, headv, aggresive athletes behind whom Stanford
men delight to stand.

CAPTAIN FREDDY ADAMS tells us the yells forthcoming from
the Stanford section of the Oakland Auditorium le; d him to believe
that Yell Leader Kinney had recruited about 10,000 men to buck the
California rooters; which proves to us that basketball players are not at
sll passive to support from the sidelines. It may be that the men under
the yell chief and his assistants had as much to do with the victory as '
some of Jimmy Davies' free throws.

REGARDING SCHEDULES the proposition that we must all take j
■"bitter with sweet" is shown by the third place generally conceded the i
University of Washington five. The Sun Dodgers took one game from j
the Bears at Berkeley, and had they drawn the Bruins for two games at
Seattle the whole conference standings might have been altered.
