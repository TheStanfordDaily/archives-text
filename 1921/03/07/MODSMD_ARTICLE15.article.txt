### 
Whitewash paint applfed to the San
' Francisco Polytechnic High School team
marked the successful opening of the
frCshman baseball season Saturday on
the local field, the final score being 4-0.
Although rather slow and uninteresting
in parts, the contest showed the fresh
men to be slightly better than might
have been expected. They went up
against rather weak opposition, but that
did not keep them from showing real
baseball.
Captain Woodward shifted his line
up considerably toward the end of the
game to give everyone a chance to play.
Four pitchers were used in the nine
innings. Bonner pitched the first three,
Loewenstein the next three, Lobree one
and two-thirds innings, and Mertz tin -
I ished the game. All four had little
j trouble in holding the San Francisco
j stick artists down, only three hits being
j collected off during the entire game.
| They struck out ten Poly High batters
j and issued two bases on balls.
Metsen, the visitor's liurler, was in
| good form except for spaces, when he
j was hit hard. His performance was er
j ratic. Ten freshmen fanned the air at
j his command, but the nine hits garnered
off him were bunched at opportune in
tervals. Deffenbach and Holmes each
got a triple, while Woodward annexed
I a double.
I Things started off well for '24 in the
! first and second innings, with two and
j one runs, respectively'. Then no more
| scoring was done until the eighth, when
four hits, cme of them a double, pro
j cured another tally. Woodward was
j safe 011 first in the opening canto when
-the first baseman fumbled a throw from
: short. Woodward stole second and
came home on Deffenbach's triple to
j deep center. Deffenbach scored on
| Strong's single to right. In the second,
I Holmes smacked a triple to right field
j with one out, and trotted over the plate
j upon Bonner's one-base hit past first.
With the exception of a base on balls
| in the third, the freshmen were then re
j tired in one, two, three order for the
j next five innings. Then in the eighth
! the big guns broke loose again and a
double by Woodward, followed by sin
■ gles by Smurr. Charles', and May, netted
j tile last run. The visitors could do
j nothing in the last two innings. Mertz
I struck out three men out of the five he

' Francisco Polytechnic High School team
marked the successful opening of the
frCshman baseball season Saturday on
the local field, the final score being 4-0.
Although rather slow and uninteresting
in parts, the contest showed the fresh
men to be slightly better than might
have been expected. They went up
against rather weak opposition, but that
did not keep them from showing real
baseball.
Captain Woodward shifted his line
up considerably toward the end of the
game to give everyone a chance to play.
Four pitchers were used in the nine
innings. Bonner pitched the first three,
Loewenstein the next three, Lobree one
and two-thirds innings, and Mertz tin -
I ished the game. All four had little
j trouble in holding the San Francisco
j stick artists down, only three hits being
j collected off during the entire game.
| They struck out ten Poly High batters
j and issued two bases on balls.
Metsen, the visitor's liurler, was in
| good form except for spaces, when he
j was hit hard. His performance was er
j ratic. Ten freshmen fanned the air at
j his command, but the nine hits garnered
off him were bunched at opportune in
tervals. Deffenbach and Holmes each
got a triple, while Woodward annexed
I a double.
I Things started off well for '24 in the
! first and second innings, with two and
j one runs, respectively'. Then no more
| scoring was done until the eighth, when
four hits, cme of them a double, pro
j cured another tally. Woodward was
j safe 011 first in the opening canto when
-the first baseman fumbled a throw from
: short. Woodward stole second and
came home on Deffenbach's triple to
j deep center. Deffenbach scored on
| Strong's single to right. In the second,
I Holmes smacked a triple to right field
j with one out, and trotted over the plate
j upon Bonner's one-base hit past first.
With the exception of a base on balls
| in the third, the freshmen were then re
j tired in one, two, three order for the
j next five innings. Then in the eighth
! the big guns broke loose again and a
double by Woodward, followed by sin
■ gles by Smurr. Charles', and May, netted
j tile last run. The visitors could do
j nothing in the last two innings. Mertz
I struck out three men out of the five he
| faced. Two errors were made by the
| freshmen, and, one by the San Francisco
j team.
