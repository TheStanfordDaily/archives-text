# THEATER TALK

### M. B., '22 
Fire!— What?
The week starts off at both our
towu movies with fire lii the atmos
phere. After seeing both of them we
feel that the most logical end for us
is by fire. We are trying to figure
out if this is a new heat-saving
scheme.
Norma Talmadge at Varsity
The Varsity wins the prize today
with Norma Talmadge as the reason.
The title of her picture is the "Brand
ed Woman." Miss Talmadge's work is
always worth seeing as she is one of
the screen's real artists. She does
her work with a seriousness of effort
that wins the appreciation and sym
pathy of her audience. Blackmailing,
lies and love make the theme of the
story. The moral is: Introduce your
husband to the family skeleton be
fore somebody beats you to it —es-
pecially if he is English.
Stanford Theater
Bill Russell in "The Cheater Re
formed," or "Why a Bad Man Goes
Good." graces the sign boards of the
Stanford Theater this week. Poor old
Bill is getting pretty old for the vil
lain and lie-ro stuff, buf somebody for
got to tell him.
Another Back-number
Another one of those movie vamps
is heading the program at the Or
plieum this week. This time it's Va
leska Suratt. No, we haven't seen the
Orpheum yet so we don't know wheth
er the rest of the bill makes up for
this mistake or not, but we've seen
Valeska .before and we know what
we think of her, and that wouldn't
take much tipie to tell. But we were
wondering if the Orpheum's adver
tisers thought they were kiF'Jng some
body into thinking they had a good
bill by head-Iming her.
