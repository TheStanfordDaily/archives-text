It's hard to believe but we can't deny
that the city papers heard about the
| basketball game Saturday night. Any
i way, we saw a report of the contest

By the way, some Stanford men can
talk as well as play, according to de
bate reports. And while we're dish
ing out election cigars we might as
well admit that we have a few singers
in our midst, if reports on the Glee
Club concert were not erroneous. And
