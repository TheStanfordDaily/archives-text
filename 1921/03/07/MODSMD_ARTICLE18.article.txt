# SEAY'S NINE LOSES TO OLYMPIC CLUB
## Shift in Line-up In the Sixth Frame Starts Slide That Ends With 6 to 1 Washout 
### 
The Olympic Club nine put the skids
under Coach Seay's njen in the seventh
inning and walloped them to the tune
of 6 to 1 in the third game of the
season on the local diamond, Saturday
afternoon.
When Draper left the mound at the
close of the sixth the score stood 1
to 0, in favor of the Cardinals, but a
combination of heavy bingles by the
Winged-0 stickmen and poor support
from the infield lost the game for
Kelly who took the hillock for the last
three innings.
Captain Bundy did the receiving for
Draper and played good ball, while in
this position laying out a hit in the
second and another in the third. Hol
ston donned the ormar and big mitt
in the sixth to take Kelly's throws,
Bundy took Mitchell's place at second,
and Mitchell men out to center field,
retiring Wayland from the game. This
general shake-up was "Doug's" neme
sis and he left the bottom out of his
fielding average with three errors.
The loco weed sickness wen to Kal
lam's head also and he made two
flukes. Patterson came in for some
of the same disease and put one black
mark against his average.
Crowe was the first to ge a hit but
there were two goose-eggs against the
inning when he went to the plate so
he failed to get around. Patterson
circled the bags in the second for the
one and only tally made by the home
team. Kallam drove out a clean hit
in the third but was thrown out at the
third sack. Bundy failed to complete
the journey when he slammed out hits
in the second and fourth. Draper fat
tened his average with a hit to right
in the fourth but did not tally. The
last clean drive was a three-bagger by
Kline in the eight but he died right
where he stopped, when Patterson hit
to htird and was thrown out for the
final goose-egg.
Heckendorf played a good consistent
game at third, and got on the bases
once out of twice up but did not com
plete. He was replaced by Maillot in
the ninth who wheedled a walk out
of Hicky and then threw the monkey
wrench into the machinery by getting
caught off first for the first out of the
inning. Kline and Crowe delivered
good work throughout the game and
every Winged-0 apple to their terri
tory fell into a well.
Hicky, the Olympic slabster, pitched
good ball, making seven strike-outs
and walking only four men. His team
backed him up with a consistency
which kept the errors down to one
black mark against Morrissey, the
first baseman.
