Scoring their sixth straight victory,
the Stanford juniors defeated the Mills
juniors, by a score of 44 to 18, in the
first game of the interclass intercol
legiate women's basketball games at
Mills College, Saturday morning. The
sophomores Were not so fortunate,
losing the second game in the last
half to the Mills freshmen, by a 21
to 25 score. Both teams played speedy
and hard-fought games. The team
work was for the most part swift and
accurate( the sophomores only losing
their advantage in the last half of
the game when it seemed as if both
matches would be won by the Stanford
teams.
The juniors played a brilliant game.
Their passing and team work was
swift, sure and accurate. Not more
than twice was the ball lost on a pass,
and in spite of the score the team
fought hard at all times for the pos
session of the ball. Throughout the
game it was more a matter of team
play than individual starring, the
whose seven working together like a
well-ordered machine*.
Stanford scored first in the first
game and it was not. until after eight
points had been piled up in favor of
the Cardinal that Jean Baillard threw
the first basket for Mills. During the
remaining time Stanford made six j
baskets and converted on two foulsj
and Mills made six more points, clos
ing the half with a score of 22 to S
lit favor of the Stanford juniors.
In the second half Stanford again
scored the first point. After the first
five minutes of play Lena Tavernettl
came in as forward in place of Mar
garet Younglove who was put into
center for the rest of the game. Stan
ford made 22 more points and Mills
10 which made the final tally read 44
to 18 in favor of Stanford.
The Mills freshmen 7 and the Stan
ford sophomores were apparently
more even matched, both teams
fighting hard from the first whistle
until the end of the game. The score
progressed for the most part in such
even rotation that not until the last
minute of play could the outcome be
predicted. In fact it was not until
the final whistle blew that the Mills
team was really sure of its victory.
Unlike the preceding match the
freshmen made the first point for
Mills. The sophomores tied the score
shortly after that and from then on
until the score was again tied 7 to 7 it
ran up with one point difference, first
favoring Mills and then Stanford.
After untying this the sophomores
gained a lead of six points in quick
succession. Mills, however, crept up
and at the end of the first half the
game stood 13 to 12 in favor of the
sophomores.
Mills converted on a foul and made
the first point in the second half. As
in the first half, the score progressed

evenly with the extra point on Stan
ford's side of the score sheet until it
was again tied lfl to 19. Mills broke
(he tie this time and kept the lead
until the end, making six points to
Stanford's two.
