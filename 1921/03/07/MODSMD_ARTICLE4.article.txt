# CLASS MEET WON BY SENIOR TEAM WITH 59 POINTS
## Hanner Features Morning by Hurling Javelin 179 Feet; Results Please Templeton 
### 
Flint Hanner's mark of 179 feet in
the javelin featured the annual Stan
ford inter-class track meet Saturday
morning which the senior team won with
a total of 59 points. Sophomore placed
second with 43 digits, followed by the
freshmen with 27 and the juniors with
2. Moldovers competed for the seniors.
Hanner's sensational work this early
in the season assures the varsity of five
points in any of the early meets and sets
a mark that California javelin throwers
have not approached by ten feet this year
in competition.
Coacli "Dink" Templeton expressed
himself as well pleased witli the marks
set, but he intends to put his men
through a strenuous week in prepara
tion for the Olympic Club affair here
Saturday. 1
Captain Morris Kirksey, who will
again hook up with Charley Paddock
of U. S. C. in the south during spring
vacation, did not exert himself in the
sprints, running only hard enough to
take the tape. Sudden, the freshman
star, did not compete in the hundred, but
took second to Kirksey in the furlong.
Bill Eddleman led all the way in the
two-mile and finished strong in 10:27,
excellent time for this early in the sea
son. Green's leap of six feet in the high
jump shows h eis already in form in
this event. Elliott easily took the mile,
and Bob Wright came up from behind
on the straightaway and broke the tape
in the quarter ahead of Clarke of the '24
team.
The annual Irish marathon, scheduled
for Wednesday afternoon is expected to
bring forward some fast time in the
440. In this affair an equal number of
runners compete from every class, each
man completing a quarter mile.
