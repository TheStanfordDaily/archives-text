# STANFORD WINS DEBATE HERE; LOSES AT EUGENE
## 
### 
Unanimous decision in favor of
Stanford on the local platform against
the University of Washington debate
team, and an equally decisive victory for
the University of Oregon over Stanford
there was the lesult of the Pacific Coast
League debates Friday night. The
standing of the three squads in the
league is probably the same, although no
advices have reached here from the
Seattle Univeisity as to the result of
the Oregon-Washington contest. Stand
ing is computed on a basis of judges'
votes.
Vernon Green, '21, and Robert Bink
ley, '19. upheld the affirmative of the
question, "Resolved, That Congress
should enact a law prohibiting strikes
in essential industries" against James
Bailey and Robert McFarland of Wash
ington on the local platform, while Paul
Erickson, '21, and David Tannenbaum,
'22, supported the negative of the issue
at Eugene.
The contest here was featured by keen
clashes of wit and an early discussion
on the important issues. The debate
lirst seemed to resolve itself into a dis
cussion on the importance of minor
points, but later simmered down to a
hotly-contested argument on the jus
ness and necessity of the plan offered
by the affirmative. Both sides attempt
ed to shift the burden of proof to the
opposition in their main speeches. Dur

ing the refutation, however, neither
team was able to pursue its early ad
vantage.
Refutation and argument of the Seat
tle team seemed to be a shade more con
vincing than that offered by the Stan
ford contestants, but effective delivery
and emphasis at the proper time resulted
in a unanimous decision in favor of the
latter.
The four Stanford men who partici
pated in the triangular contest were, all
experienced speakers and have had sev
eral months training in the discussion
of labor problems. Their success this
season, however, is largely due to their
efficient instruction under Coach M. L.
McClintock.
Rinkley was well known in local de
bating fields before the war and won the
Bonnheim dissertation five years ago.
He has taken an active part in debate
since the first of the year and showed
hiniself to be capable of strength in ref
utation in Friday's contest.
Green is a transfer from Redlands
University, lie was a member of the
Redlands team that debated Stanford
last year on the question of compulsory
arbitration of railway labor disputes
llis effectiveness in both refutation and
delivery marks him as one of the best
debaters on the campus. Me is a mem
