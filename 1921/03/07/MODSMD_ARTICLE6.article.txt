# Nut Gatherer Has Mean Line, Opines Special Reporter

"Madly plowing the wild wavelets,
the enraged flivver, screaming fire and
defiance from every haust and ex-haust,
plunged into the flock of flying oy
sters "
"Hush, hush. You'll feel better after
the show tomorrow. Lie down and
sleep."
Thus did we try to quiet the spokes
man for the English Club play, the "Yel
low Jacket." The strain of Imperial
robes de nooey (modern French for the
ancient nightgown), and mysterious
beauties who pulled wires was too much
for hi mand he had gone gathering nuts
in May.
The squirrels seemed to be bothering
him on his quest, for in his calmer mo
ments we managed to get this story from
him.
He said that the director of the play,
Gordon Davis, went to the city Friday
and came back with a costume even
more elaborate than the ones already
gathered. This one is an enormous
cloth of gold affair with a ten-foot train
requiring two attendants to hold it. It
is brilliantly embroidered on the out
side, and on the inside it is lined with
the soft fur from squirrel "tummies."
The fur of the squirrel is much finer
on the under side than on the back, and
only the "tummy" is used.
Incredulous, we investigated his story
and found that Gordon Davis really had
the robe "exactly as described or money
cheerfully refunded." Whereupon we
awarded the English Club the funeral
director's megaphone and invested in
two pasteboards for their play.
