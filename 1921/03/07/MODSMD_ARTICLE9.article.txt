## 
### 
Coach Murphy's boxers will meet the
Blue and Gold team in the annual cham
pionship meet Friday night, March 11, at
the Harmon Gymnasium. Murphy will
go into the light heavyweight bout him
self and will give away twenty pounds
as he tips the beam at 145. The Bruin
man in this weight is Jimmy Cline, who
beat Mark Evans last year. Joe went
against Jimmy Smith of U. S. C. in the
same weight lsat season, and two years
ago he boxed in the welter and middle
weights, giving away about ten pounds
on one match and over twenty on the
other.
Brad Simmons will take the ring in
the bantam weight, and from the way he
has been going in the last two weeks he
will be likely to bring home the bacon.
"Mike" Hodges is an able defender of
the honors among the* featherweights
and uses a play of footwork which will
keep Jimmie Brennan, Bruin entry, busy
if he expects to pile up points on this
clever mitt artist. Jimmie Ross will go
in aht 138 pounds, and Jimmie's past
performances speak for themselves with
little need for high-flown verbage to back
them tip.
Bill burkhart is to meet Theis of Cal
ifornia in the welter class. Bill has been
leading the squad in all-around class
this season and should punch out an
easy victory, although Theis is a veteran
and beat Hugh Stewart in last year's
meet. Mark Evans, veteran of the
game, goes in as a middleweight, and
the man who gets the decision on mark
will know bet has been through a battle.
Harley Carter is as hard as a rock, and
when the heavyweight man from Cali
fornia gets one squint at Harley's stal
wart frame he will be in line for buck
fever or something worse.
No definite officials have been chosen
as yet, but they will be picked from sev
eral Olympic Club men who are old
hands at the game.
