# JOHNSTON, DAVIS, KINSEY, GARDNER TO APPEAR HERE
## Stellar Players of Net Game to Play Exhibition Match Against Varsity Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford students will be given a rare
treat tomorrow when William M. John
ston, world's doubles tennis champion
and thrice national doubles and singles
champion, will play on the local courts.
With Johnston will appear a glaxy of
stars in the tennis world in Willie
Davis, Carl Gardner, and Howard Kin
sey.

This is Johnston's first appearance at
Stanford, and the local tennis fans have
gone to a great deal of trouble in secur
ing the champion for Founders' Day.
Johnston is probably the greatest player
of tennis the world has produced, and is
considered by all to be the most con
sistent. Although a small man, Johnston
is noted for his especially fast drive
and accuracy in planting the ball in the
corners of the courts. Johnston has just
returned front Australia, where as a
member of the Davis cup team he aided
in bringing the Davis cup back to the
United States. He also attracted world
wide fame last spring in his matches
with Tilden in .England, defeating the
best of the world before King George V.
Willis Davis, who will also ;:ppear
with Johnston, has an enviable record
in the tennis world, being conceded a
place among the best. Carl Gardner
and Howard Kinsey, who make up the
rest of the contingent, arc known all
over the United States for their ability.
Carl Gardner is a former holder of the
national doubles championship, while
Howard Kinsey is present holder of the
Northwest and Washington State titles
and the championship of Southern Cali
fornia. Kinsey has also been Pracific
Coast doubles champion for three years.
Arrangements are being made to have
several of the Stanford varsity squad
compete against the tennis stars in sin
gles as well as doubles tomorrow. Al
though no definite team has been picked,
the players who will be pitted against
Johnston and his squad will be selected
from Jim Davies, Phil Neer, Berry Fish,
and Skee Turner
Berry Fish and Ekee Turner have
shown a great mprovement over last
year in pre-season matches and are in
good shape to put up a good fight against
the champions should they be selected.
Both are good men and have had much
experience with the varsity.
Davies, due to basketball, has had but
little time for tennis this year, but in the
few games that he has played has shown
a much improved game. His basketball
experience will also leav£ him in the
best of condition and he should be able
to make the world's champion extend
himself- in case he is selected. Last year,
as a member of the Stanford varsity,
Davies won the California and Coast
intercollegiate singles and doubles cham
pionship, and local fans may look for
ward to an excellent display of tennis
should Davies meet Johnston.
Captain Phil Neer of the varsity may
be seen in action against the champions
anil Neer's former experience will be a
source of trouble for his opponents. In
the doubles matches tomorrow Neer and
Davies will probably be paired off
against Johnston and Davies, while Hsh
and Turner will play against the other
members of the squad.
The matches will start at 12:45 and
arrangements are being made to accom
modate the crowd in the form of bleach
ers built around the courts.

Davis, Carl Gardner, and Howard Kin
sey.

This is Johnston's first appearance at
Stanford, and the local tennis fans have
gone to a great deal of trouble in secur
ing the champion for Founders' Day.
Johnston is probably the greatest player
of tennis the world has produced, and is
considered by all to be the most con
sistent. Although a small man, Johnston
is noted for his especially fast drive
and accuracy in planting the ball in the
corners of the courts. Johnston has just
returned front Australia, where as a
member of the Davis cup team he aided
in bringing the Davis cup back to the
United States. He also attracted world
wide fame last spring in his matches
with Tilden in .England, defeating the
best of the world before King George V.
Willis Davis, who will also ;:ppear
with Johnston, has an enviable record
in the tennis world, being conceded a
place among the best. Carl Gardner
and Howard Kinsey, who make up the
rest of the contingent, arc known all
over the United States for their ability.
Carl Gardner is a former holder of the
national doubles championship, while
Howard Kinsey is present holder of the
Northwest and Washington State titles
and the championship of Southern Cali
fornia. Kinsey has also been Pracific
Coast doubles champion for three years.
Arrangements are being made to have
several of the Stanford varsity squad
compete against the tennis stars in sin
gles as well as doubles tomorrow. Al
though no definite team has been picked,
the players who will be pitted against
Johnston and his squad will be selected
from Jim Davies, Phil Neer, Berry Fish,
and Skee Turner
Berry Fish and Ekee Turner have
shown a great mprovement over last
year in pre-season matches and are in
good shape to put up a good fight against
the champions should they be selected.
Both are good men and have had much
experience with the varsity.
Davies, due to basketball, has had but
little time for tennis this year, but in the
few games that he has played has shown
a much improved game. His basketball
experience will also leav£ him in the
best of condition and he should be able
to make the world's champion extend
himself- in case he is selected. Last year,
as a member of the Stanford varsity,
Davies won the California and Coast
intercollegiate singles and doubles cham
pionship, and local fans may look for
ward to an excellent display of tennis
should Davies meet Johnston.
Captain Phil Neer of the varsity may
be seen in action against the champions
anil Neer's former experience will be a
source of trouble for his opponents. In
the doubles matches tomorrow Neer and
Davies will probably be paired off
against Johnston and Davies, while Hsh
and Turner will play against the other
members of the squad.
The matches will start at 12:45 and
arrangements are being made to accom
modate the crowd in the form of bleach
ers built around the courts.
Stanford students will be given a rare
treat tomorrow when William M. John
ston, world's doubles tennis champion
and thrice national doubles and singles
champion, will play on the local courts.
With Johnston will appear a glaxy of
stars in the tennis world in Willie
Davis, Carl Gardner, and Howard Kin
sey.
