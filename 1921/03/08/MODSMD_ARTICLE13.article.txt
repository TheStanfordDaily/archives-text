						TURNING POINT
## 
### 
Tomorrow, with various exercises from assembly to concert and
marathon we turn to the memory of the Stanfords, founders of our alma
mater. â™¦
And we cannot help but believe that were Senator and Mrs. Stanford
alive today they would view with considerable satisfaction the present
turning point of the University, as we see it. the merging of Stanford
into a public institution.
Our University has proceeded beyond the sphere of a limited educa
tional establishment. The ideal of service to the "children of Cali
fornia," say of the nation, can well be realized only with sub
stantial future alumni and public support. The Stanford which is in the
future to be a progressive dynamic force in the field of education and
science must be the Stanford of the United States, not of Palo Alto.
That Stanford has already moved from the former to the latter
position is shown by the Carnegie Corporation action in placing the
food institute here. Such eastern recognition shows that Stanford is
more than a university of California, and more than a Pacific Coast insti
tution, arid the founders, could they learn, would no doubt delight to
know that the University brought by them into existence is now devel
oped beyond the proportions of a private institution to a Stanford capable
of commanding wide public support and able to continue with an ideal of
world service. m
