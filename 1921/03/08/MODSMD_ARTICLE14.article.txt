# IN APPRECIATION

Miss Harriet Bradford's resignation as Dean of Women and her
decision to leave the Stanford community are received with much regret
by members of the University. Under Miss Bradford the office of Dean
of Women has developed from a comparatively insignificant position in
1915 until it has come to be regarded as one of the most important in
the scheme of University administration.
Stanford people appreciate the great good that has come of Miss
Bradford's constant looking to the better standard and position of Stan
ford women. They appreciate, too, that the Women's Council, the
Women's Conference, and other student organizations have found her
always ready and willing to cooperate with them and are sincerely sorry
that she is now leaving Stanford.
Miss Elizabeth llogue, 01, a Stanford graduate of varied experi
ence, should be well qualified to take up the duties of the office of Dean
of Women and carry on the work of Miss Bradford.
