# A 						REAL PRIVILEGE

### 
An opportunity to hear the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
the Stanford Memorial Church is a privilege not often extended to Uni
versity students. Dr. Gardner announces that the University has gone
to considerable trouble and expense in providing a special platform in
the church from which the best resonant qualities of the building may
be utilized.
A fact which can scarcely escape student appreciation is that no
charge will be made to those who come to hear the symphony orchestra
â€¢on Wednesday night. The concert is for students and faculty of the
University alone. Few Stanford people will want to miss an opportunity
to hear the famous San Francisco artists in the most favorable setting
imaginable. No more fitting memorial service in honor of the founders
could be provided.
