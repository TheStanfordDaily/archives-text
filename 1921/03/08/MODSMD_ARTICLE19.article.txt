# Y. M. C. A. OPENS DRIVE FOR OLD CLOTHES FOR BASE HOSPITAL NEEDY
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning boxes for the
purpose of receiving any old clothes, to
be distributed to the needy men at the
Rase Hospital, will be placed in the halls
of Encina and Sequoia and elsewhere
among the men's living groups. There
are about 3(10 men in the government's
charge who need street clothes as well
as the issue hospital garments, and the
Y. M. C. A. is undertaking to collect
these on the campus for the Red Cross
to distribute among the men.
There are 175 ex-service men in the
hospital whose compensations are pend
ing and who therefore have no money
with which to buy clothing.
Besides this number of service men,
there are 120 merchant mariners whom
the government is taking care of. Most
of these are old men having no com
pensations which could lie delayed, and,
if possible, are in even greater need
than the veterans.
Any clothes that can lie made useful
by washing and repairing are desired
all pairs being tied secureh together
Students who live in Palo Alto or in a
private home on the campus can bring
their contributions* to the \. M. C. A.
office.
The V. M. C. A. board also wishes to
call the attention of the students who
responded to their drive earlier in the
quarter that March 15 draws near and
it is at this time that the pledges are
due.
