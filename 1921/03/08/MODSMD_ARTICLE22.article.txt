one morn Saturday afternoon, when
they beat the Union Iron Works team
from San rrancisco, 1 ;o C. At the
same time, the American Legion team
of Palo Alta, were, defeated, 2 to 1,
by the Olympic Club.
The varsity game was as well play
ed is could be expected under the con
ditions. The field was wet, the uncut
grass which has flourished on the oval
since the recent rains making it a
slippery game. The teams agreed to
play for 45 minutes straight, without
intermission for halves. Weller shot
the varsity goal towards the middle
of the game.
The American Legion put up a good
fight against the Olympic team, but
found that they were not quite strong
enough to win. At that, they played
better socced than they have lany
time since the season started, and
show a remarkable development. The
Olympics had a few of their Sunday
League players in to strengthen their
team, and htad a formidable machine
to go up against. The score at half
time was 1 to 1. Just before the end
of the. second half the clubmen shot
the goal that won the game.
The American Legion team plays the
Italian Club next Saturday. The var
sity eleven has no further games on
its schedule, and is through for the
season, unless some trip is decided on.
