# CLIFF IRELAND LEADS INDEPENDENTS AGAINST CARDINAL BASEBALLERS
## 
### 
Cliff Ireland will lead his far-famed
Ireland Independents baseball team
to -the Stanford campus tomorrow, to
engage the Cardinal varsity in the first
contest of a two-game series. Inci
dentally Cliff will add a little to the
fun, sport and amusement of Founders'
Day, with his well-known antics on
the coaching line and around second
base, where he has. been holding forth
as the leader of his inimitable nine
since—well the oldest men on the
campus cannot recollect just when
Cliff did not take care of the keystone
hassock.
Ireland is known all up and down
the coast for wit and the mean line
of verbiage he purveys. He alone is
responsible for the sacrifice strike-out
and is a past master at this new
wrinkle of the national pastime. He
usually gathers unto himself one
bingle each year and who knows but
what he may garner it off one of the
Stanford chuckers. Also, annually he
spears a line drive behind first base
and tosses a runner out. But, even if
he fails in these two things he is sure
to knock the bleacherites off their
seats with his running fire of clean
wit which is always a feature of his
-annual appearance.
Besides Cliff himself the Independ
ents boast of a mighty classy aggrega
tion of ball-tossers. Already this sea
son they bested the fast St. Mary's
college nine and have taken a 6 to 2
win fro«i the California varsit> As
Cliff usually has a bunch of transient
big-league and coast league players it
is not known just what his starting
line-up or battery will be. Needles® to
say, it will be a good team that trots
out against Seay's men tomorrow aft
ernoon on the campus diamond.
Coach Seay will start either Green
I or Kelly on the pinnacle with. Bundy
doing the receiving. Draper will be
held for the Saturday {.game against
the Independents, while Nef may as
sist, the above-named hurlers tomor
row.
The infield will be chosen from Pat
j terson, Kallam, Mitchell. Crowe, and
Heckendorf. The outer gardens will
be patrolled by Kline, Wayland, Car
ver, Crowe, and Mitchell.
The game is scheduled for 4 o'clock
and the admission price will be 50
cents or Student Body cards.
