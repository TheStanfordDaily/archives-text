# BEAUTY, MUSIC, FUN IN "YELLOW JACKET" TONIGHT
## Rich Costumes and Novel Settings in Play; Cast Fine 
### 
With a accnic production that
stamps it as the most ambitious per
formance ever staged at Stanford,
with Gordon Davis himself playing the
leading role and ably supported by
such talent as Anne Gardner, '20,
Emily Wardman, '23, and Mathew
Torbriner, '24, and with a play that
sparkles with freshness and humor —
the "Yellow Jacket" tonight promises
to be the dramatic hit of the year.
The play is produced with richness
and spirit that even a Junior Opera
seldom attains. Color effects of in
finite variety and beauty, enchanting
music blended perfectly with the ac
tion, and a humor that twinkles with
merriment —these aro some of the de
lights which await the audience.
Much of the finest comedy in tho
piece centers around the character
of Daffodil, the rich man's son, play
ed by Matthew Torbriner, '24. Just
when a scene has been worked up
to a high emotional pitch, Daffodil
comes along with some light comment
and deftly changes the whole spirit
from tragedy to farce. Torbriner is
a newcomer to Stanford dramatics

but by many he is regarded of a
"find."
Dean Ross, '23, as the Property
Man, has not a word to say, yet by
reason of his importance to the play
and his ability at pantomime he will
be one of the hits of the show. C. M.
Morris, '24, and Mary Wildman, '22,
as the old farmer and his wife, also
put over some excellent acting.
Other good parts are those of the
Governor and his wife, played by
Orion Clapk, '24, and Dorothy Wilson,
'23, the father-in-law played by Robin
Lampson, '23, and the maid to Plum
Blossom, played by Grace Brown, '23.
Paul Joseph, '24, as Chorous, Richard
Blood, 21, as the Spirit, and Scherl
Levy as the hunchback, do good work.
A number of disabled veterans from
the Base Hospital at Menlo Park will
bo guests of tho English Club at the
play. A row of seats has been donated
for their use.
"The Yellow Jacket" has been one
of the great international successes of
. tho past decado and the reason for it
]is not hard to see. In fact you can
see it for $1.25, the price of a ticket
to the show.
