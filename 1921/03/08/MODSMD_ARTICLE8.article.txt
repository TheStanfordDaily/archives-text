# TOMORROW DEDICATED TO STANFORDS' MEMORY
## Celebration Suitable to the Occasion Is Arranged For Founders' Day Tomorrow 
### 
"Dedicated to the memory of the
founders of the University." This
brief sentence contains the keynote
of the services to be held tomorrow
on the campus in honor of the three
Stanfords who made this university
possible. As each new years rolls
around, new faces take their place
among the ones already here, and it
is fitting and proper that they should
know something of the origin and
purposes of this memorable day.
Soon after the opening of the uni
versity it. was felt that some suitable
celebration should be arranged in
honor of the founders. Dr. Jordan
first suggested that the birthday of
Leland Stanford, on May 14th, should
be celebrated as a university holiday.
This idea was accordingly adopted
and the first Stanford Memorial Day
was celebrated on May 14th, 1892. On
the 20th of June of the next year
Senator Stanford died and the first
real Founders' Day Exercises were
held on March 9th, 1894. The exer
cises of that day took place in the
old gymnasium and the principal ad
dress of the day was delivered by ex-
President Benjamin Harrison. In the
same year it became apparent that
Memorial Day fell too* near to the
end-quarter examinations and it was
accordingly combined with Founder's
Day, and they have been jointly ob
served ever since.
Down in 1901 the exercises seem to
have been centered chiefly in the
thought of commemorating the birth
day of Senator Stanford. In 1901,
however, the Register for that year
placed the apostrophe in "founders"
after the "s", thus implying that the
term was ment to include all the
founders, and that spelling has been
observed ever since. So now, in ob
serving Founders' Day, we are cele
brating the birthdays nof of Senator
Stanford alone, but of Mrs. Stanford
and Leland Jr., also.
The day, since 1894, has been ob
served with an appropriate program.
Usually it has been a university holi
day, but in the last few years, at
tendance of the students at the day's
function has been so poor, that the
University authorities refused to per
mit a vacation on that date. The fol
lowing extract from the report of the
committee on public exercises to the
President of the University, for the
year of 1920. may shed some light
upon the subject.
"It is depressing to reflect that, with
the possible exception of the earliest
years of the (University, efforts to
celebrate the day by declaring it a
holiday and arranging appropriate
exercises have met with but indiffer
ent and half-hearted response from
faculty and students. â€”If Founders'
Day is to be thought of merely as a
day of freedom from university work
and as affording an opportunity for 1-
o'clock dances, automobile trips, and
picnics in the hills, there is little

reason for declaring it a holiday."
The committee on public exercises
is especially anxious this year to have
a complete observance of the day. In
view of the purpose for which it is
set aside, it would seem that Stanford
students and 'the Stanford Faculty
might at least make some effort to
attend the different ceremonies and
sports activities that have been ar
ranged by the committee in charge.
