# TOMORROW DEDICATED TO STANFORDS' MEMORY
## Celebration Suitable to the Occasion Is Arranged For Founders' Day Tomorrow 
### 
"Dedicated to the memory of the
founders of the University." This
brief sentence contains the keynote
of the services to be held tomorrow
on the campus in honor of the three
Stanfords who made this university
possible. As each new years rolls
around, new faces take their place
among the ones already here, and it
is fitting and proper that they should
know something of the origin and
purposes of this memorable day.
Soon after the opening of the uni

celebration should be arranged in
honor of the founders. Dr. Jordan
first suggested that the birthday of
Leland Stanford, on May 14th, should
be celebrated as a university holiday.
This idea was accordingly adopted
and the first Stanford Memorial Day
was celebrated on May 14th, 1892. On
the 20th of June of the next year
Senator Stanford died and the first
real Founders' Day Exercises were
held on March 9th, 1894. The exer

old gymnasium and the principal ad

same year it became apparent that
Memorial Day fell too* near to the
end-quarter examinations and it was
accordingly combined with Founder's
Day, and they have been jointly ob

Down in 1901 the exercises seem to
have been centered chiefly in the
thought of commemorating the birth
day of Senator Stanford. In 1901,
however, the Register for that year
placed the apostrophe in "founders"
after the "s", thus implying that the
term was ment to include all the
founders, and that spelling has been
observed ever since. So now, in ob
serving Founders' Day, we are cele
brating the birthdays nof of Senator
Stanford alone, but of Mrs. Stanford
and Leland Jr., also.
The day, since 1894, has been ob
