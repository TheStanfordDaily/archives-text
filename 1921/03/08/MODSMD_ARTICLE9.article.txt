## 
### 
At the meeting of the Interfraternity
Conference last night Art Wilcox, '21,
and Jess Thrash. '21, were elected presi
dent and secretary, respectively, for the
coming quarter.
The election of officers was the prin
cipal business which occupied the meet
ing, but other matters which came be
fore the conference, and upon which
action was taken, were: the appointment
of a committee to act upon cases of mis
conduct by fraternity men which come
before the conference, and the adoption
of a proposal wherein' the eating'clubs
shall require all men who join their
organizations to sign a separate paper in
which they agree not to join a fraternity
unless they are permitted to resign from
the eating club to which they belong by
the members of that cfub
The resolutions adopted relative to the
conduct of fraternity men provide that
a fraternity man seen in an intoxicated
condition upon the campus shall be rc
poried to the Interfraternity Conference
and by them to the head of the house to
which he belongs, to be dealt with as the
house sees fit. in the cast of hrst offense.
\nd if tiie s.'ime man is reported again
for this offense be is to be reported bv
the conference to the Student Council
for punishment. This plan was reconv
giendcd by the Alumni Interfraternity
Conference of San Francisco, and while
its adoption is in the nature of an ex
periment, it is hoped that with proper
co-operation of those responsible it will
lie sufficient to cope with the situation
which has arisen upon the campus.
