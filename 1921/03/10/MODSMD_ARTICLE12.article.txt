tirm in as many years, and rAet defeat
at the hands of the Stanford varsity.
The final count was 6 2, and it was to
the credit of the varsity that they sae,-
ceeded in winning by such a score.

minor and Class A A league players, has
j whipped California and St. Mary's al
jo*<ly tins year St> lin and SandV <?f
; the Salt Lake team, Conncly of the San
i Francisco team, and Jack Killilay, -a
former Coast Leaguer; and Cunning
ham and Ritchie of the Western League,
• are examples o# tire kind of opposition
j Stanford went up against.
•George Green pitched for the Car
: dinals and hurled the whole game, some
, thing none of Coach S cay's pitchers had
j done as yet this season. He was*in good
: form, allowing only hvc hits. He walked
j two men and struck oijt three.
Stanford fireworks started out nv-the
second inning, and bpfore the smoke of
battle had cleared away four runs had
trickled over'tin platter. Kline walked,
i Heckendorf attempted a sacrifice, but
was thwarted, for the catcher threw the
liall away, allowing Kline to. score, white
Heckendorf rested on second. Patterson

scoring Heckendori. Wayland sacrificed
and Bundy flew out. Green lined a hot

I Cliff Ireland himself was as usual, the
real feature of the game. His rapid-fir*
i line of wit and humor kept the spec-,
tators and players from becoming bored
at .nv time. He showed a p<' feet fid A

I putouts and one assist without an error.
Tin game showed the Stanford nine
to havt improved a great deal since lar.i

Green's good showing was especially
> heartening, and he received perfect sup
port, no errors being chalked up on the
, Stanford side.
