# The 						Founders Day Program
## 
### 
Founders' Day was celebrated yesterday in a way appropriate and
fitting. The introduction to the present freshman class of founders'
Day and what it means was an excellent one, and heijped us to still further
understand «nd know the "Stanford Spirit," a full understanding of
which, wtfi.>elieve, does tiot come suddenly and magically as soon as we
sign our names to out* registration cards, but which -rs assimilated all
through the first and on into the second years in the University. Mrs.
Stanford gave as fine an example of "Stanford Spirit" as \\£ could wish
fo., ;t pi cedent to follow, when she ma !• her sacrifices that the Uni
versity might go on. There i.-. no need to moralize at' great length on
this phase -it is sunyething that spreaks for itself directly and commands
attention. ,
One thing in connection with yesterday's program seems fairly .cer
tain; student s do want holidays, not merely for relief from clr/sirooms,:
I>ut so the occasion may be fittingly observed. The attendance at the!
assembly, at the laying of the cornerstone, and other exercises of the day '
proved this. Perhaps the afternoon attractions drew more spectators
than die fnorning events, not because <if any difference in the events but;
through the simple, well-known fact that some people get up later in the !
r day than others.
In this Connection, it should be noted how complete the day was'
with the various events, and credit is due those who arranged the pro
gram and satv that it was-carried out. From the assembly in the morn
ing to the Symphony Concert at night no one could raise the complaint
that there was nothing to do or see. From now on, however, final ex's
Moll hold the. center of the stage, and although not by any means bowing
t<> repeated applause, will probably bate, two or three encores before the
eng tgv'menl closes a week from Friday.
