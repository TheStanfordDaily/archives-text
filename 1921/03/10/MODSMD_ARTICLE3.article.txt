## AUDIENCE STUNG BY YELLOW JACKET Prop Men Prove Living Ad For Bull Durham; Lighting Knocks 'Em Dead 
### BY 
jye r-irgiisn l iuu play, Ine * enow
; Jacket," produced Tuesday, night in the
Assembly Ilall before a large,and en
thusiastic audience, was undoubtedly the,
dramatic hit of the season. From the
first appearance of the quaint little Chi
nese property man amid the clash of
cymbals and the rattle of the drums, to
the- drawing of the curtain on the final
assemblage of the the audi
ence sat spell bound in an atmosphare
as deliciously Oriental as it was possi
ble for modern stage craft to make it.
In the past the Knglish Club has en (
Joyed the reputation for producing so
called "high-brow" and literary produc
tions. The play last night demonstrates
the fact thpt.it is possible for them to
present an offering which combines real
merit with spontaneous dramatic ap
I peal. if the club profits by this lesson
aim continues to produce performances
wWi the dual attractions which were of
fered last night they may be assured
of real campus support/' *
The cast Swas an unusually large one,
but everyone fitted admirably into the
parts in which they were cast. Gordon
Davis, -IK, as Wu I 100 Git, played the ;
lead—if any certain definite character]
'
although the part did not offer such
abundant opportunities for dramatic in- J
terpretation as had been hoped for. nev j
erlhelcss Davis ,extracted everything
•
cumstances. His gestures were espe
cially good. In addition to taking this
more or less heavy part himself, he also,
directed the play in its entirety, and his
work in that capacity a trib-j
ute to him..
The part of Moy hall Lay, Plum
blossom, was taken by Anna Gardner,
! '20 who, by sheer personality, breathed j
into ap otherwise almost "wooden" per l
sonagc, a certain delicacy of touch> and
maun r that was irresistible*. Her
11une ■ il . > were «;«.rgei»u . and tl
coupled with a beautiful face andaij a#j
pealing manner, made lux easily the j
leading feminine rble in the perform
ance.
Another character that evoked nior<|
| than passing interest was Chee Moo, the j
j unfortunate first wife of VN u Sin Yin
ithe Great, portrayed by Dorothy Pierce.
11 remotional ability was most marked.
It is a very great testimony in her be- ;
half that she was able to hold the audi
! cnce tense and solemn during a scene ,
in which she was represented as-bid
; ding farewell to her infant son forVver ;
before she ascended into heaven,, j
the. only visible presence of the*' child ,
v\as a crudely constructed bundle of
i rags. And again* a_s she ascended the
j stcpladder which represented the road
t«i the eternal regions above,, the audi
was distinctly moved b. the *pa
thetic parting scene arid only 'sensed the
j ridiculous-aspect of it all after she was
(gone. So it may be faiely said thaf the
pathos in the "Yellow.Jacket' was whol- j
ly the rcstilt of the etccellent efforts ;

! mother's love. |""
