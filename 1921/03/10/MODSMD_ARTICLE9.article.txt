Nothing could have suited the cile
bration of Founders' Day more perfect
ly than the Sacred Cfcncejt produced
by Alfred Hertz's San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra in the Memorial Church
yesterday evening. The setting alone
■ was impressive with the artistic mosaic
background serving as a true portrait
of the ethereal strains created by the
musicians. An exceptionally beautiful
program wri< presented jyitV> a w|de di
versity of theme which every

of sadness. Thesejvere interpreted with
an exccll nee of quality and perfection

The Prelude to "Lohengrin" made the j
ftpening for the first and second violins,
which, by soft chords played in the high
est register of the instruments, symbol

of angels bearing the Holy Grail, 'i lien,
the entrance of the Grail by base viols
and 'cellos produced a beautiful combi-*
nation of tone. The culmination of
f< 4ir:i, in the climax by /he whole or
chestra made a tremendous effect. FM j
lowing the light of/the' Grail in all its
rlory conies a'definite fading jdayed
| by" muted strings. The way in which
this descent was handled by the musi
cians showed their complete 'rpastery of
j tone inflection and made this part the
I most exquisite in the sclectidn.
j The allegro molto of Mozart's "Synv
1 phony in G Minor" was fdled with melo ,
die contrast From the delicate strains
I likened to the v "gentlest rains" to the
i quality of stiffening lime in the transi-
Itfonal theme, the violins displayed their
"j technique. But uhder all the variations
'the principal melody was njpver lost. The
f, andante furnished the serious mood of
j tlfe piece, and the broken rhythm of the
|Violins echoed by the basses j?rcw in So
lemnity. In direct contrast the
i ' net came in with bright humor coqpted
