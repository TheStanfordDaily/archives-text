Nothing could have suited the cile
bration of Founders' Day more perfect
ly than the Sacred Cfcncejt produced
by Alfred Hertz's San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra in the Memorial Church
yesterday evening. The setting alone
■ was impressive with the artistic mosaic
background serving as a true portrait
of the ethereal strains created by the
musicians. An exceptionally beautiful
program wri< presented jyitV> a w|de di

an exccll nee of quality and perfection

The Prelude to "Lohengrin" made the j
ftpening for the first and second violins,
which, by soft chords played in the high

of angels bearing the Holy Grail, 'i lien,
