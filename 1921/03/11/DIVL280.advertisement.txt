The big or little
company—which?
WHEN the talk turns to where should a
fellow start work, a question arises on
which college men naturally take sides.
' 4 You'll be buried in the big company," say
some. "Everything is red tape and depart
ments working against each other."
"Your little company never gets you any
where,'* others assert. "The bigger the
company the bigger your opportunity."
And that seems true —but in a different
sense. Not physical size but bigness of purpose
should be our standard for judging an indus
trial organization just as it is forjudging a man.
Where will you find this company with
a vision?
Whether its plant covers a hundred acres
or is only a dingy shop up three flights is on
the face of it no indication of what you want
to know —is such and such a company more
concerned with developing men and ideas than
boosting profits at the expense of service?

There are industries and there are companies
which offer you every opportunity to grow.
Spiritually they are as big and broad as the
earnest man hopes to build himself. It you
are that kind of man you will be satisfied with
a company of no lower standards.
t Conversely, if you are working for such a
big-souled company, the very fact will argue
that you yourself are a man worth while. For
in business as in social life a man is known by
the company he picks.

The electrical industry needs men who can
see far and think straight.

An organization which holds for its
ideal the hope that it may measure up
to the aspirations of those who work
in it. J 1
