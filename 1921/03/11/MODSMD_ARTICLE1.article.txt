# SEAY'S NINE AND IRELAND'S STAGE BOUT TOMORROW
## "Cliff" Brings Down Large Line of Bleacher Talk and Additional Big Leaguers 
### 
Coach Scay's men will meet the Ire
land Independents on the local field
Saturday afternoon with the strong in
tentions of adding another victory to the
one taken from Cliff's renowned nine
last Wednesday. The game will be called
at 3 o'clock.
Draper is to take the mound for the
varsity, with Kelly and Nef in reserve.
Last Saturday Draper held the Olympic
Club down to no tallies during the six
innings that he was in the game. If the
men back him up with the same brand of
support they gave Green Wednesday he
should have little difficulty in sending
the invaders home with another empty
game bag.
Coach Seay will use the same lineup
that has been working in previous
games: Patterson, Mitchell, Htteken
dorf, and Kallam on the infield, and
Kline, Crowe, Wayland, and Carver in
the outer territory. This machine came
through without an error in the last
game and have been improving steadily
since the season optned. From the way
the dope looks at present, Stanford is
started on one of the most successful
baseball seasons of her history.
Green broke slabster traditions by
walloping the apple for two hits in
Wednesday's game, one pf them a two
bagger. Kallam was strong with the
fungo and his base-running was of the
score-getting caliber. Bundy, Patterson,
and Kline wielded the stick with con
sistent effectiveness, and they soon took
the fun out of the afternoon for Killi
lay, Ireland's slabster.
Cliff was loaded fo bear on his first
invasion, from the appearance of his list
of Coast Leaguers, and his second at
tack will probably be with additional
reinforcements. To augment these he
has a line of original nerve-racking wit
which is always good for one tally.
Cliff's line is so unoffensive and his
sportsmanship so evident that the
psychological effect makes the opposing
team feel duty bound to give him the
game. But Coach Seay's squad wants
to keep their averages up and this will
counter all generous thoughts.
