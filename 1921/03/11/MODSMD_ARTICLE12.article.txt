# Cardinal Set for Olympic Club Clash on Track Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Outside competition will be offered
the varsity track squad tomorrow af
ternoon for the first time this season
when the strong Olympic Club team
from San Francisco makes its appear
ance here. The Freshmen team com
petes with the combined high school
aggregations from Mountain View and
Palo Alto, starting at 1:30.
Coach Templeton announced today
that the team to go south to oppose
the University of Southern California
during spring vacation will be select
ed largely on the showing tomorrow.
Strict training rules were put into ef
fect for both varsity and freshman
squad members this week. Smoking,
drinking, late houra and dancing have
bzeen put under the ban by the Car
dinal mentor.
Keen competition is expected' in
most of the events tomorrow, as the
Olympics have always gathered to
gether a strong aggregation of track
men. Such runners as Hunter, Hay
ward and Forward should give the
Stanford quarter-milers and distance
men considerable trouble in breaking
the tape.
Freddy Adams, basketball captain,
turned out for practice yesterday for
the first time this season, heaving the
shot close to the forty-foot mark.
Adams placed against California last
year and his return to the squad gives
the varsity a strong weight man.

Morris Kirksey, varsity captain, is
in shape to give Paddock, hoB old
rival, plenty of trouble when the var
sity meets U. S. C. Kirksey will
probably not attempt to run the 220-
yard race in the south on the curved
track of the southern institution^
Kirksey has turned down an oppor
tunity to go to Hawaii the latter part
of the month to compete in the cham
pionship of the islands. The com
mittee in charge of the affair at Hono
lulu endeavored to secure Kirksey,
"Brick" Muller and several other
prominent athletes to take the trip
but it is probable that none of the
men will accept because of the fact
that the big meet is little more than
a month away.
Sport followers will watch with in
terest the results of the California
•U.S.C. clash at Los Angeles tomor
row. First opportunity to compare
the relative strength of the Board
and the Cardinals thas season will be
presented when 'empleton's men meet
the southerners the following week.
