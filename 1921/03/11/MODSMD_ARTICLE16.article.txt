# FRESHMAN BASEBALL TEAM PLAYS THIRD GAME ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
The freshman baseball team will
unloose its heavy artillery and other
available forces on the San Mateo
High School nine tomorrow afternoon.
This will be the third of the series
of high school games that have marked
the opening of the seasan. So far the
freshmen have won one and lost one
game.
"Swede" Righter has been putting
his charges through a thorough prac
tice each afternoon, and results are
beginning to showy The infield is
working with more precision and
smoothness, and the whole squad is
exihiting some of the team-work that
will be necessary to win games. So
far no individual star has been devel
oped. so it will be on steady, consist
ent playing rather than a flashy work
that the freshman nine will have to
depend this season.
Of the pitchers, Bonner has been as
consistent as the rest. Loewenstein,
Mertz and Lobree show promise of
coming through with more practice.
