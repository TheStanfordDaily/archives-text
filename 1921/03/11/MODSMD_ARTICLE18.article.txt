# "JOFFRE" DEBATE WITH CALIFORNIA SET FOR APRIL 2
## Green, Martin, and Bowen, Preparing for 'Argument Under Coach McClintock 
### 
Vernon Green, '21, L. B. Martin, '22,
and T. E. Bowcn, '23, will represent
Stanford in the annual debate with Cali
fornia for the possession of the Joffre
medal, presented the individual winner
of the extemporaneous contest by the
Republic of France, on April 2, the
first Saturday night; dt the spring
quarter.
The Cardinal trio has been working
under the instruction of Coach M. L.
McClintock since the beginning of the
season and will be well prepared to
establish a record for effective speaking.
Green, who was a member of the vic
torious team which debated the Univer
sity of Washington here last Friday,
has taken the place of D. L. Goodman,
'22, who will be unable to compete this
year. Goodman was a member of the
Joffre squad last season.
The Joffre medal, formerly known as
the "Medaille Carnot," is presented every
year by the French republic to "the
most effective speaker" of the two uni
versities. No decision is given sides,
since teams chosen from the two squads
draw for side and order of speaking on
the evening of the contest. The debate
is wholly extemporaneous and is always
on a subject pertaining to France.
California speakers have won a ma
jority of these annual discussions since
the establishment of the contest twenty
five years ago by Baron de Coubertin.
The last medal won by Stanford was
awarded to J. E. Driscoll, *18.
The contest will be held on the local
campus in the Assembly Hall. No ad
mission will be charged.
