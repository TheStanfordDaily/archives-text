# COMMITTEE SELECTS JUNIOR OPERA TEXT, IS 'MAID TO ORDER'
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Junior Opera
Committee yesterday afternoon the play
for production by the class of 1922 was
decided on. The title is "Maid to Order"
and was written by Rosemary Drach
man, '21, with the cooperation of Dan
Evans, '20. This is the firstâ€žexperience
Miss Drachnian has had as a playwright,
though she has had a number of stories
published. Dan Evans will be remem
bered as having a hand in the writing
of this year's Ram's Head show and is
also a writer of lyrics. The committee
has had a hard time selecting the opera
this year, as there was such a wealth of
talent to choose from. Probably the
most distinctive feature about Miss
Drachman's book is the clever and
snappy dialogue. The situations are also
clever, as most of the action is in a
modiste shop, which gives plenty of
room for colorful settings. There are
about ten in the cast and the only draw
back is that it gives the men characters
more opportunity than the women, which
is rather breaking the precedent of
Junior Operas. However, there is room
a-plenty for the fair sex in the chorus.
The committee advises that those in
terested in tryouts should watch the first
issues of the Daily Palo Alto next quar
ter for announcement of the dates for
these.
