When the last final paper is finished and the last student has boarded
Ijis Pullman or steamer or Stutz, all will be happy in the anticipation
of an enjoyable Easter vacation, but all should be even more happy in
the bright prospects for the Spring' Quarter to which they will return
at the holidays' end.
Coach Powell's basketball five in its last victory over California lias
made the vacation more enjoyable for every student of Stanford. The
victory of Coach Seay's nine over Cliff Ireland's Wednesday leads us to
believe that his combination will be able to take care of the Cardinal
baseball reputation in very neat fashion this year. We kno-w that "Dink"
Templeton's track men have been doing - hard work, and their showing
tomorrow should furnish further discouragement to any who may want
to look with, pessimistic eyes on the Cardinal spring athletic prestige.
In the new major sport, tennis, we have one of the best teams which
has ever played on Encina courts.
But athletics are not alone in providing background for a Stanford
man's enjoyable vacation. The University itself has just taken an un
precedented step forward in national standing and possibilities in receiv
ing the food research institute. Alumni associations show many signs of
getting more squarely behind the administration. A revision of entrance
requirements is definitely promised, and a real honor system seems well
on the way to establishment in the immediate future.
Truly there is every reason why Stanford men, in shaking hands
with fellow students and wishing them a happy vacation, should mean
every word that is said; there is every reason why Stanford men should
enjoy a happy holiday period, doing good for Stanford where good may
be done; and return at the end with the enthusiasm that will make of
bright possibilities the actuality of success in the University Spring
Quarter.
