for a year and spent the following sum
mer as a lecturer in that institution. In

in co-operation with the Naval and
Military Intelligence along with other
agencies, and was largely concerned with
the problem of investigating and keep
ing track of alien enemies. During

has oversight of the annual reports, of
two sets of prize essays —the Justin
Winsor and the Herbert Baxter Adams
essays —and whatever the association
puts into print.
His time in Washington is partly taken
up with writing, the result of investi
gations into ccrtain phases of the his
tory of American administrative prac
tices. He is the author of a volume
entitled "The President's Cabinet)"
(1912) and of numerous articles and
papers that have appeared in reviews
and publications of chief interest to stu
dents of history, such as "The Amer
ican Historical Review," "Political
Science Quarterly," "The Nation" (New
York), and others.

1920.
Dr. Learned was born in Exeter, New
Hampshire. He received his early edu
cation in the Smith Academy, St. Louis,
Mo. He entffred Harvard in 1886 and
was granted and A. B. in 1890 and an
A. M. in 1897. Following his graduation
from Harvard, Dr. Learned taught for
three years in private schools in
Plymouth, Mass., and Chicago. He re
ceived an A. M. degree from the Uni
vercity of Chicago in 1894 and took a
position as instructor in history in the
Armour Institute of Technology in Chi
cago, which he held for two years.
On leaving Chicago, Dr. Learned re
turned to Harvard, where lie served as
an assistant in the history department
for a year and spent the following sum
mer as a lecturer in that institution. In
1899 he went abroad to continue his
studies at Leipzig under Professors
Erich Marcks and Karl Lamprecht. On
returning to tlje United States lie was
an instructor in' American and European
history at Yale and later a lecturer on

in co-operation with the Naval and
Military Intelligence along with other
agencies, and was largely concerned with
the problem of investigating and keep
ing track of alien enemies. During
twenty-five months lie was in part re
sponsible for the reading of many thou
sands of files bearing on persons under
suspicion for a variety of reasons. Re
ports, official correspondence, and tele
grams were a part of the daily routine.
For a time he visited three of the four
large internment camps sustained by
the government. At Atlanta he saw
some of the thirty members of the Ger
man U-boat 58, the first enemy sub
marine sunk bv Americans off Ireland in
November, 1917.

dent of the Board of Education of the
District of Columbia and chairman of
the committee on publications of the
American Historical Association. He
has oversight of the annual reports, of
two sets of prize essays —the Justin
Winsor and the Herbert Baxter Adams
essays —and whatever the association
puts into print.
His time in Washington is partly taken
up with writing, the result of investi
gations into ccrtain phases of the his

tices. He is the author of a volume
