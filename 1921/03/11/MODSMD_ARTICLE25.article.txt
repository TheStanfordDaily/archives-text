Af'er having been infamously libel
ed yesterday by the instigators of
the verdant sheet, the Cabbage patch
feels badly trampled. In fact, so
badly trampled and ground up in
general that the appellation "saur
kraut" was maliciously tacked over
the front gate. We have one consola
tion. A full quarter remains tor
piece-meal revenge.

Speaking of ostrich eggs, did you
know that the man who laid the
corner-stone Wednesday was named
Newhall ?

Yes, a rough may be the King of
Hearts, a co-ed may be the Queen of
Diamonds (maybe), a member of the
varsity nine may be the Jack of Clubs
bu the engineer will always be the
Ace of Spades.

Wein—Federal sleuths are shadow

Stein—Ah! Sort of a lunar eclipse,
eh?

John, put on a new needle. The
pencil hasn't got the good old rare
like it usta was. We're goin' on pa
role durin' spring vacation and hope
six ways from Sunday that somebody
else gets the job next quarter.

We're not wishin' anybody any bad
luck, but if they want to kick off in
a coupley courses, all they gotta do
is to sign up for a spring quarter's
worth of cold slaw a la Daily sauce.;
It'll get 'em down, John. For refer
ence apply at Registrar's office week
after next.

After all, it ain't so bad. We got
an offer to write funeral dirges for
an undertaking establishment after a
shot at this. Better hop on the gravy
train. John.

If you want a good thug to swat
flies, John, call on us. We've got
spiders on the ceilin'. Just take this
away; we've been the green pea long
enough.

HOT DOG! THERE AIN'T NO
