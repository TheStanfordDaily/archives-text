## 
### 
A new asphalt tennis court is being
put in at the Faculty Club House. It
was found necessary to install the new
court for" the benefit of the twenty-five
or thirty tenni senthusiasts who find the
present courts inadequate. The new
court, which will be finished and ready
for use by the latter part of April, is
being laid down under the supervision
of E. B. McDonald. New backstops are
also being installed at one end of old
courts.
