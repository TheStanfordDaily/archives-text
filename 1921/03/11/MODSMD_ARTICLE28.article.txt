Prologue
Due to the overflow of dramtic ma
terial on the campus and thereabouts
this week, ye ed was saved the change
that would have taken her to the city
for inspiration. The English Club and
the class in dramatic interpretation have
been the cause of this.
"I bow"
Yes, we agree with you that English
Club play was worth the money, in
length if nothing else. According to
campus opinion, the "Daffodil" and the
property man probably scored .the big
gest hit. The subtleties of the latter's
part were delicious. The lack of words
tn his part was probably half of its suc
cess, in contrast to the tiresome flow of
"augusts" and "illustrious" in the lines
of the others. The chorus took upon
himself the burden of the play, acting
as prologue, prompter, and toastmaster.
One-act plays in Little Theatre
It's really too bad that the campus
overlooked the one-act plays that have
been staged in the Little Theater this
week. Yesterday afternoon and evening
'Gordon Davis' class in dramatic- inter
pretation worked off their final examina
tion in the form of self-directed one-act
plays, some of the most popular and
best known being on the program. A
few passers-by or friends of the casts
happened in, but outside of that the
players had little encouragement. "In
the Zone," "The Proposal," and "The
Florist Shop" were to be given this
afternoon starting at 1:30 o'clock. The
last two have been given on the campurf
before.
Get the Hook
Speaking of dramatics, the holdovers
have without a doubt missed their call
ing, either as playwrights or actors.
Such clever, original interpretation of
that art is rarely seen. Yea, if we had to
depend on the holdovers for cleverness
it would be a long-faced old world.
