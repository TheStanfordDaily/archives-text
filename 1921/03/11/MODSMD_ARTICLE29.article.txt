"HONOR" PLEDGES
The only hesitation that the commit
tee«has found in getting the honor sys
tem pledges signed is in the third clause,
•which states that that in cases WHERE
OTHER MEASURES HAVE NO
EFFECT, the signer will see that the
men's council or the women's council
become aware of the infraction. This
clause does not mean that when one
sees a person cheating he is to run im
mediately to the council, decidedly not.
It simply means that after all other
measures have failed he will do this.
He can tap with his pencil, shuffle his
feet or use any means he may wish to
let the person who is cheating know that
he is observed, or the one who sees
that person cheating can wait until after
wards and quietly inform him that we
have an honor system at Stanford, or
use any means that his discretion may
dictate. This gives all the leeway in
the world and no one is obligated to re
port the case to the council until his
own judgment tells him that the person
observed needs reporting.
The whole purpose of these cards is
not to have a pledge to hold over the
heads of the signers, but simply to let
the faculty know that the student body
is really behind the honor system and
wants to make it go. These pledges will
enable the committee to go to the faculty
with something tangible and representa
tive of the entire student body, and will
enable them to approach the proper au
thorities as representatives and not mere
talkers on the subject. No one has re
fused to sign the cards after they have
found out their real purpose except
about fifteen out of fourteen hundred,
and so far there has been wonderful
unanimity in the march towards its
adoption. MARION KYLE, '18.
