# STANFORD GYM TEAM RECEIVES CHALLENGE FROM BEAR MAT MEN
## 
### 
Coach C. S. Botsford has received a
challenge from the University of Cali
fornia gym team to meet the Stanford
tumblers at either Harmon Gymnasium '
or Encina.
The date suggested is April 2, but as
that time will not give the Stanford
men a long enough season for training
the meet will probably be held later in
the month. It has been suggested that
the gym contest would be added to the
Spring Carnival entertainment if it
could be arranged for that date.
The events covered in the challenge
are horizontal bars, parallel bars, rings
and tumbling.
