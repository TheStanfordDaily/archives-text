# DUCI DE KEREKJARTO WILL APPEAR TUESDAY
## Hungarian Violinist Will Give Program in Assembly Hall; D'Antallfy is Accompanist 
### 
On Tuesday night, March 15, at 8:15,
Frank W. Healy will present in the As
sembly Hall an artist who he anticipates
will prove to be a genuine sensation, in
the person of Duci de Kcrekjarto, Hun
garian violin virtuoso, and who, on the
occasion of his American debut at Car
negie Hall last November, laid claim to
and won the praise of the critics and
music lovers of New York. At the time
of his first appearance it was believed
that such exhibitions of violinistic tech
nique as his had been offered by no
newcomer before him since the memor
able debut of Jascha Heifitz.
Kerekjarto is said to have everything
that a violinist needs to pin popular
acclaim. His tones are lustrous, refined
and delicate. The critics found him to
have command of all the intricacies of
violin technique accompanied by a tone
that was at all times melting and flow
ing. He was particularly enthusiasti
cally received for his feats of wonderful
finger work and digital dexterity in
Paganini's "Witches' Dance."
Accompanying Kerekjarto will be De
siderius d'Antallfy, celebrated Budapest
composer and organ virtuoso.
