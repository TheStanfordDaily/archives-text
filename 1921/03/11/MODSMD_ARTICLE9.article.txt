# VARSITY BOXERS TANGLE TONIGHT AT HARMON GYM
## Coach Murphy's Men Will Try For Title Against Pick of California's Ring Artists 
### 
The final decision reached last night
by Coach Murphy and Bobbie Johnson,
California coach, after a two days' ses
sion, was that the intercollegiate cham
pionship will be decided. by only three
of the bouts staged in the annual inter
collegiate boxing meet at Harmon Gym
nasium tonight.
"Mike" Hodges, Jimmy Ross, and Bill
Burkhart are the only men of the Stan
ford team eligible under Conference
rulings. Mark Evans and Harley Carter
are barred because they are special stu
dents, and Brad Simmons has not com
pleted his third quarter of work neces
sary for varsity standing. Decisions will
be given on their bouts, but they will not
be held under Conference rulings and do
not affect the championship.
It is doubtful whether Joe will-enter
the meet against Jimmy Cline as sched
uled, and in case he stays out Mark
Evans will go against the touted Bruin
warrior. Cline is conceded to be the best
middleweight on the Coast and Mark
will need all his Alaskan grit and heavy
punches to get the decision. But Mark
is in good condition, and this fact, to
gether with his cool head and ring gen
eralship, will give him a big chance of
upsetting the dope. If Joe goes in Mark
may go against Brown of California in
the light heavyweight class. "Husky"
Wassum, winner of the middleweight
championship in the local meet this year,
is in the hospital with the mumps.
"Brad" Simmons, bantamweight, the
big little man of the Cardinal team, is
shadow boxing like a 118-pound whirl
wind, and when he steps out tonight
night armed with some trusty mitts
and Murphy science the taller and
rangier Silorman will need some shock
absorbers on his short ribs.
"Mike" Hodges is to meet Jimmy
Brennan, who lost to Rothwell of Stan
ford last year. The dope is that Brennan
is a harder man to beat this year, but
"Mike" is veteran enough at the game
to hold his own with any featherweight
on the Coast." He has all-around boxing
class and coupled with that a punch
which makes knockouts easy.
Jimmy Ross has been mixing boxing
and track in a profitable way for wind
and endurance. Jimmy means business
from the first until the last gong and his
low criss-crosses to the body are hard
to block. He can stand up under severe
punishment while delivering it and, un
less the dope is all wrong, will annex
another scalp to the one he took from
the Bruins last year.
Bill Burkhart has beerf the ring sensa
tion of the year in local bouts, and it is
rumored that the camp across the bay
feels shaky about the welterweight
honors. Bill meets high-class boxing re
quirements in all directions. He handles
his mitts like a veteran, uses a fast foot
work which is baffling, does a lot of
quick thinking, and when he leads out
there is no sluggishness in the swing.
In case Bill cannot shrivel himself down
a couple of pounds today Johnny Lane
or Walter Bills may have to take this
weight, Bill going in the middle class.
These men are no novices at the game
and Irvine will need his whole bag of
tricks.
Harley Carter and Alhswede are both
well over 190 pounds and in good shape.
Harley has the advantage of unusual
speed and cleverness. He is light on his
feet and his muscles work freely and
easily. Last night when he donned the
trunks for a light workout there was
not a kink in his whole hammering ma
chinery.
The advance sale of tickets for the
meet has been larger than for any box
ing show ever held at Harmon Gym
nasium. In addition to the students and
outsiders, there will be a large group of
assemblymen from Sacramento present
as guests of the university. Phil Noonan
will referee, with Sol Levison and Joe
Hicky as judges, and Joe Niderost as
timekeeper. All of these men are mem
bers of the Olympic Club.
The bouts follow:
Silorman (C.) vs. Simmons (S.), 118
pounds; Brennan (C.) vs. Hodges (S.),
128 pounds; Gerson (C.) vs. Ross (S.),
138 pounds; Irvine (C.) vs. Burkhart,
Lane, or Bills (S.), 148 pounds; Jimmy
Cline (C.) vs. Mark Evans (S.), 158
pounds; Alhswede (C.) vs. Carter (S.),

not affect the championship.
It is doubtful whether Joe will-enter
the meet against Jimmy Cline as sched
uled, and in case he stays out Mark
Evans will go against the touted Bruin
warrior. Cline is conceded to be the best
middleweight on the Coast and Mark
will need all his Alaskan grit and heavy
punches to get the decision. But Mark
is in good condition, and this fact, to
gether with his cool head and ring gen
eralship, will give him a big chance of
upsetting the dope. If Joe goes in Mark
may go against Brown of California in
the light heavyweight class. "Husky"
Wassum, winner of the middleweight
championship in the local meet this year,
is in the hospital with the mumps.
"Brad" Simmons, bantamweight, the
big little man of the Cardinal team, is
shadow boxing like a 118-pound whirl
wind, and when he steps out tonight
night armed with some trusty mitts
and Murphy science the taller and
rangier Silorman will need some shock
absorbers on his short ribs.
"Mike" Hodges is to meet Jimmy
Brennan, who lost to Rothwell of Stan
ford last year. The dope is that Brennan
is a harder man to beat this year, but
"Mike" is veteran enough at the game
to hold his own with any featherweight
on the Coast." He has all-around boxing
class and coupled with that a punch
which makes knockouts easy.
Jimmy Ross has been mixing boxing
and track in a profitable way for wind
and endurance. Jimmy means business
from the first until the last gong and his
low criss-crosses to the body are hard
to block. He can stand up under severe
punishment while delivering it and, un
less the dope is all wrong, will annex
another scalp to the one he took from
the Bruins last year.
Bill Burkhart has beerf the ring sensa
tion of the year in local bouts, and it is
rumored that the camp across the bay
feels shaky about the welterweight
honors. Bill meets high-class boxing re
quirements in all directions. He handles
his mitts like a veteran, uses a fast foot
work which is baffling, does a lot of
quick thinking, and when he leads out
there is no sluggishness in the swing.
In case Bill cannot shrivel himself down
a couple of pounds today Johnny Lane
or Walter Bills may have to take this
weight, Bill going in the middle class.
These men are no novices at the game
and Irvine will need his whole bag of
tricks.
Harley Carter and Alhswede are both
well over 190 pounds and in good shape.
Harley has the advantage of unusual
speed and cleverness. He is light on his
feet and his muscles work freely and
easily. Last night when he donned the
trunks for a light workout there was
not a kink in his whole hammering ma
chinery.
The advance sale of tickets for the
meet has been larger than for any box
ing show ever held at Harmon Gym
nasium. In addition to the students and
outsiders, there will be a large group of
assemblymen from Sacramento present
as guests of the university. Phil Noonan
will referee, with Sol Levison and Joe
Hicky as judges, and Joe Niderost as
timekeeper. All of these men are mem
bers of the Olympic Club.
The bouts follow:
Silorman (C.) vs. Simmons (S.), 118
pounds; Brennan (C.) vs. Hodges (S.),
128 pounds; Gerson (C.) vs. Ross (S.),
138 pounds; Irvine (C.) vs. Burkhart,
Lane, or Bills (S.), 148 pounds; Jimmy
Cline (C.) vs. Mark Evans (S.), 158
pounds; Alhswede (C.) vs. Carter (S.),

The final decision reached last night
by Coach Murphy and Bobbie Johnson,
California coach, after a two days' ses
sion, was that the intercollegiate cham
pionship will be decided. by only three
of the bouts staged in the annual inter
collegiate boxing meet at Harmon Gym
nasium tonight.
"Mike" Hodges, Jimmy Ross, and Bill
Burkhart are the only men of the Stan
ford team eligible under Conference
rulings. Mark Evans and Harley Carter
are barred because they are special stu
dents, and Brad Simmons has not com
pleted his third quarter of work neces
sary for varsity standing. Decisions will
be given on their bouts, but they will not
be held under Conference rulings and do
not affect the championship.
