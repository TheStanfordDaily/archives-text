# VARSITY BOXERS TANGLE TONIGHT AT HARMON GYM
## Coach Murphy's Men Will Try For Title Against Pick of California's Ring Artists 
### 
The final decision reached last night
by Coach Murphy and Bobbie Johnson,
California coach, after a two days' ses
sion, was that the intercollegiate cham
pionship will be decided. by only three
of the bouts staged in the annual inter
collegiate boxing meet at Harmon Gym
nasium tonight.
"Mike" Hodges, Jimmy Ross, and Bill
Burkhart are the only men of the Stan
ford team eligible under Conference
rulings. Mark Evans and Harley Carter
are barred because they are special stu
dents, and Brad Simmons has not com
pleted his third quarter of work neces
sary for varsity standing. Decisions will
be given on their bouts, but they will not
be held under Conference rulings and do
not affect the championship.
It is doubtful whether Joe will-enter
the meet against Jimmy Cline as sched
uled, and in case he stays out Mark
Evans will go against the touted Bruin
warrior. Cline is conceded to be the best
middleweight on the Coast and Mark
will need all his Alaskan grit and heavy
punches to get the decision. But Mark
is in good condition, and this fact, to
gether with his cool head and ring gen
eralship, will give him a big chance of
upsetting the dope. If Joe goes in Mark
may go against Brown of California in
the light heavyweight class. "Husky"
Wassum, winner of the middleweight
championship in the local meet this year,
is in the hospital with the mumps.
"Brad" Simmons, bantamweight, the
big little man of the Cardinal team, is
shadow boxing like a 118-pound whirl
wind, and when he steps out tonight
night armed with some trusty mitts
and Murphy science the taller and
rangier Silorman will need some shock
absorbers on his short ribs.
"Mike" Hodges is to meet Jimmy
Brennan, who lost to Rothwell of Stan
ford last year. The dope is that Brennan
is a harder man to beat this year, but
"Mike" is veteran enough at the game
to hold his own with any featherweight
on the Coast." He has all-around boxing
class and coupled with that a punch
which makes knockouts easy.
