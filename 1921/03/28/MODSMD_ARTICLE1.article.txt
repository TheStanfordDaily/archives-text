# DEFINITE PLANS FOR FINANCING STADIUM GIVEN
## Vigorous Drive Among the Friends of Stanford to Go Towards Bowl Expenses 
### 
Definite plans for financing the con
struction of the athletic stadium an
nounced today by the Board of Ath
letic Control give assurance that the
project has passed beyond the stage
of debatable proposals and that no
doubt remains that the bowl will be
completed, probably in the fall of 1922.
The plan as announced this morning
is the result of several months con
sideration of proposed measures by
the Board, which, at its last meeting,
whipped into shape the details of the
coming financial campaign.
The initial cost of the bowl will be
covered by the proceeds of tVie drive
which will be vigorously waged among
the friends of the University. Today
letters were mailed to the alumni,
faculty and friends of Stanford Uni
versity throughout the country, asking
for contributions to the stadium fund.
The request little resembles the usual
financial appeal based upon sentiment
for it assures the subscribers the
double privilege of securing the best
seats in the bowl at a price below that
charged the public and of contributing
to a scholarship fund or other univer
sitty need, according to their own se
lection.
The Board says In its statement
outlining the plan: "The Board will
assure to every subscriber for each
$100 subscribed the right to purchase
two of the best seats for the annual
football game with the University of
California in a special 'Subscriber's'
Section," regardless of any allotment
system during the next fifteen years—
whether the game is played at Stan
ford or at Berkeley. This privilege
will begin when the stadium is com
pleted." The one limitation placed
upon the offer is that for a subscrip
tion of $500, or above, a maximum
of ten seats is placed upon an assign
ment to one person.
A novel feature of the campaign is
tne agreement of the Board to ulti
mately transfer the amount of each
subscription out of gate receipts, to
the University, for whatever purpose
the donor may designate at the time
of making the gift. A special fund for
general University purposes such as
scholarships will be erected to which
the subscriber may assign his sub
scription. The Advisory Board of the
Alumni Association, in consultation
with the University authorities,, shall
determine the specific use to which
the fund shall bo devoted when the
amount of the subscription shall be re
mitted from the gate receipts.
While the Board recommends that
the donor assign his gift to the special
fund he may name any other purpose
to be aided by the transfer of the
amount of the subscription. In the
Doane plan, as this offer is termed
because it was suggested by E. W.
Doane, '95, the Board believes that it
has found an added incentive for the
public to contribute.
Stanford rooters receive a decided
preference in the seat prices as a
charge of only $1.50 will be made to
the crimson-capped spectators. The
cost of a seat to a fund subscriber will
not exceed $4 00, under the guarantee.
Possibly this sum will bo reduced, but
the Board deems it inexpedient at
present to fix the price of seats
throughout the whole fifteen-year
period. The best seats will be sold
to non-subscribers at $5.00 for the
first year.
Revision of the cost of the bowl
places the estimate at only $200,000,
instead of $750,000, the sum first be
lieved necessary to finance the stadi
um. In a large measure the reduc
tion has been made possible by the
decision to use wooden bleachers in
place of concrete as was originally
planned. If desirable, the wooden
seats can later be replaced with con
crete.
Within the next two monthß work
will actively start, the engineers
planning to begin the excavation which
will continue to the depth of twenty
three feet. Following the completion
of the excavation, in the summer, the
earth will be banked around the bowl
next fall and allowed to settle dur
ing the winter. The Board estimates
that by the fall of 1922 the bleachers
will be completed.
Facilities for both football and track
will be provided by the stadium. The
area within the horshoe will contain
American and Rugby football fields, a
quarter-mile track, and spaces for
jumps, pole vault, and shot put. Tho
oval containing these fields will be
502 feet long and 355 feet wide.
Special provision is made by the
plans to provide comfortably for the
spectators who may be seated up to
a number approximating 59.000. Ad
ditional automobile and standing room
will bring the total number of possible
spectators up to 65,000. Seats will be
spaced two feet apart and the aisles
between seats will be four feet wide.
The distance of the nearest seat from
the center of the playing field will be
173 feet and of the highest seat on
the ends of the oval 415 feet.
Subscription blanks may be obtain
ed from the Board of Athletic Control
or Graduate Manager Martin. Pay
ment of the entire pledge may be
made immediately or half of the
amount may be paid before May 1,
a quarter before Junel, and the final
ffuarter before July 1.
