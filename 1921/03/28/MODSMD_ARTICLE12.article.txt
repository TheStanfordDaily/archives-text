# TRACK SQUAD WINS FROM OLYMPICS BY CLOSE RELAY 66-65
## Southern California Track Stars, Led by Paddock, Record Breaker, to Clash with Varsity Tomorrow STELLAR COLLECTION OF OLYMPIC GAMES MEN WILL BE SEEN 
### 
University of Southern California
track stars, led by the new world
record holder, Charley Paddock, will
meet Coach "Dink" Templeton's Cardi
nals on the Stanford track tomorrow
afternoon. While the affair should
result in an easy victory for Temple
ton's men, several races should pro
vide thrills enough to last the rest
of the year.
Captain Morris Kirksey, Paddock's
strongest rival in the world, may not
compete against the southern flyer,
who was timed Saturday in world rec
ord time in the hundred and the fur
long events. The Cardinal captain is
in none too good shape and it is feared
that a hard race might result in in
juries that would put him out for the
season.
Should these stars clash, however,
track fans will see the two bes f . races
of the year. When they met at Los
Angeles during vacation, both men
ran neck and neck for seventy-five
yards where Kirksey's stride broke.
After that the Stanford skipper ran
only hard enough to take second.
George Schiller, star U. S. C. quarter
miler and Olympic Games runnen, will
meet some strong competition from
Bob and Kenny Wright tomorrow.
Schiller is in the best of shape as evi
denced by his close race with Hend
rixson of California Saturoay.
"Swede" Evans, is the third star
from U. S. C. who will be on hand to
try to annex markers from the Stan
ford total. Evans was a member of
American Olympic Games team also
and has a mark of 140 feet in the dis
cus and well over forty feet in the
shot put.
The U. S. C. team is expected to ar
rive on the campus late today or early
tomorrow morning. Student body
cards will be necessary for admittance
to the meet.
