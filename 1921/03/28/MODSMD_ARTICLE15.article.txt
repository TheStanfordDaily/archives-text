aggregation here Saturday. The relay
decided the meet and Wright came up
from behind on the straightaway, passed

point winner of the day, taking firsts in
both dashes and a third in the discus.

exceptional in that he loafed during the
last twenty-five yards of the race.
Flint Hanner annexed two first places,
the shot and the javelin. His record of
over forty-one feet in the weight event
stamps him as a dangerous contender
against Majors and Mathews, the Cali

their own way although Myers; the lone
Stanford entry, pressed Forward,
Farmer and Roach until the straight

fast time of 9:50. The strong wind on
the back stretch hindered him in his at
tempt to run 9:40.
