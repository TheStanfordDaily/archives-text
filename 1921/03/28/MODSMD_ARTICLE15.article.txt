# MORRIS KIRKSEY IS BIG POINT WINNER IN SATURDAY MEET
## 
### 
Bob Wright's finish in the'last lap of
the relay gave Stanford a 66-65 victory
on the track over the fast Olympic Club
aggregation here Saturday. The relay
decided the meet and Wright came up
from behind on the straightaway, passed
Johnny Norton, of the Olympics, and
broke the tape, giving the Cardinals a
one point margin.
Captain Morris Kirksey was the big
point winner of the day, taking firsts in
both dashes and a third in the discus.
His mark of 21:3 in the furlong' was
exceptional in that he loafed during the
last twenty-five yards of the race.
Flint Hanner annexed two first places,
the shot and the javelin. His record of
over forty-one feet in the weight event
stamps him as a dangerous contender
against Majors and Mathews, the Cali
fornia shot putters, in the big meet this
month.
The Olympic Club milers had things
their own way although Myers; the lone
Stanford entry, pressed Forward,
Farmer and Roach until the straight
away. Charley Hunter, of the Olym
pics, easily took the two-mile in the
fast time of 9:50. The strong wind on
the back stretch hindered him in his at
tempt to run 9:40.
Weaver and Heath, the Stanford high
jumpers, tied for first in tii.is event,
best'ng Mint Howell of last year's fresh
man team. Both of the Cardinal jump
ers cleared 6 feet 1 ineh. '
Johnny Norton, former 'Stanford'star,
running for the Olympic Club, 'won both
hurdle events from Jess Weljs.,,. Wells
