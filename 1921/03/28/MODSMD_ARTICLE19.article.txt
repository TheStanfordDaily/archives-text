# COMMENT ON HOOVER
## 
### 
Harding's appointment of Herbert Hoover, '95, to the heretofore
comparatively unimportant portfolio of commerce has attracted j)erhaps
more attention than that of any particular Cabinet member. It is notice
able always that in the Secretary of Commerce it is the caliber of the
man which is noticed more than possible political considerations.
The editor of the. University Daily Kctnsan is perhaps typical of
contemporary college commentators, who finds satisfaction not only in
the appointment of Hoover but in the "good beginning," in these words:
"Herbert' Hoover has shown himself to be not only an efficient food
administrator,, but a true American citizen. When he took the oath of
Secretary of. Commerce he dealt the death blow to office seekers as far
as that department is concerned. Hoover stated his platform clearly
when he said, 'This is no political department: the job hunters will not
find anything here.'
"Herbert Hoover will be a bigger man than he is or has been if lie
proceeds and continues to carry out such a non-partisan and broad
minded attitude during his term as Secretary of Commerce. Tf he shows
himself capable of performing such a service to his country, he will be
an example for all politicians to follows, and will exhibit the bigger citi
zenship which our nation must strive for in the future."

REGISTRATION BOOKS were reccved by many students today after
a short time of waiting in line. Much of the tediousness of registration
was removed by the arranging of four windows in place of the former
two for the disbursement of books, and also by the previous preparation
of the books for immediate release to the applicant at the window.
