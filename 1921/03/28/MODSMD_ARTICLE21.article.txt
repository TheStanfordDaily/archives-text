He was born on November 25, 1884, at

in the Spring of his senior year and
made the squad in that sport.
After his graduation from the uni

in Political Economy for the remainder
of the year. In 1914 and *15. he served
as an assistant in the department at
Chicago and then was chosen as an
instructor to teach the subjects For
two years he held this position when
in 1917 he was appointed a professor

join the colors.
He was sent to the first United

months of work in France. Part of

was ordered to rejoin his organiza

was transferred to the 49th Infantry.
Early in January of 1919 he was sent
back to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Serving at several different military
posts, he remained in the army until
his discharge in September, 1919.
From that time until the present
date he has held the position of assist
ant professor of Economics at Stan
ford. His duties permit him time for
outdoor recreation and when not on
the football field or in the class room,
he is found on the golf links or in the
swimming tank. Professor Canning
does not care for the "movies" but fre
quently runs up to San Francisco to
witness the latest offerings on the
stage. He is also fond of music and
rarely misses a concert on the cam
pus. A short story, under his favo
rite author, is "Sherlock Holmes."
