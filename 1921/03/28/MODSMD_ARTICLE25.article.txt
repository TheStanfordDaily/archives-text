'Way Down East
D. W. Griffith has another work of
: art to his credit in the production
;" 'Way Down East" which has been
playing at the Stanford Theatre and
!in San Francisco at the Curran. The
play is concerned with life, and Lillian
Gisli takes the part of the girl and
I Dick Barthermes, the part of the boy.
! Doth are finished actors of emotions
; and feelings. They carry the weight
of. the play but are well supported by
i a wonderful cast of character actors
: that turn from the tragic to the comic,
i It is a beautifully staged and directed
I picture and we wish they would pro
duce more of them.
The Columbia
The Sweetheart Shop at the Colum
; bia has been scoring a hit in San
; Francisco as a rather good musical
! comedy. There are some clever lines,
j clever dancing and clever girls, but
j the music isn't so good. The sailor,
! around whom the plot winds, is alone
I wo#li going to see for he is about/the
best dancer that has hit San Francisco
i in a long time.
Charlie Chaplin
j The Tivoli is showing Charlie Chap
! lin jn "The Kid," which is his latest
| picture and which is coming to Pnlo
1 Alto soon. It is a little different from
the usual run of his pictures as it
| combines a feeling with
j that slap-stick stuff. The best acting
in the piece is done by the youngster
that supports Chaplin and gets as big
a percentage of laughs as Charlie.
