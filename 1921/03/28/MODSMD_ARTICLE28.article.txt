# INTRA-MURAL TEAMS AND SOCCER SQUAD GIVEN NEW GROUNDS
## 
### 
Two new soccer fields, two intramural
baseball diamonds, and ten new tennis
courts are to be constructed on the
campus in the near future, according to
a statement made today by Dr. Browne.
The new ground has already been sur
veyed and partially cleared, and as soon
as labor can be secured the work wilt
continue.
The soccer fields will be placed east
of the polo grounds, and will Ik- just to
the south of the gymnasium on the other
side of tTÂ»e road leading from Encina.
They will be adjacent so that one man
can easily coach two teams in play.
The baseball diamonds will have home
plate at the road corners of the soccer
fields and will play the fielders in the
center of the soccer plots.
There are two new tennis courts being
constructed near this lot and the present
soccer grounds are to be used in con
structing ten more courts. The ground
has been surveyed and will soon be
plowed and disked. It is hoped that the
coming intramural games in baseball can
be played on these new diamonds.
