## 
### 
Coach ring artists won two
out of three meets during the vacation,
defeating California and the University
of Southern California and losing to the
Los Angeles Athletic Club.
In the meet with California at Har
mon Gymnasium on March 11 there
were only three intercollegiate bouts and
the Cardinal glove wielders took all of
them. Mik- Hodges defeated Brennan
of the BllTe and Gold in the 125-pound
class. In the lightweight class Jimtnie
Ross beat Gerson. Bill Burkhart came
through in the welterweight for a vic
tory over Irvine of California.
The exhibition bouts were:
115 pounds—Silverman (C) defeated
Simmons (S).
1 157 pounds—Brown (C) defeated
Evans (S).
158 pounds—Murphy (S) defeated
Cline (C).
Heavyweight — Carter (S) defeated
Aftergut (C).
Murphy took his men to Los Angeles
on March 19 and defeated the U. S. C.
team at the Union League Club to the
tune of three out of five bouts. Brad
Simmons, Cardinal bantamweight, beat
R. V. Wright of the southern squad.
Mike Hodges took a technical knockout
from Max Wright in the featherweight
class. Mattis of U. S. C. received the
decision over Jimtnie Ross in the light
weight division. Fairbanks knocked out
Johnny Lane, the Cardinal welterweight.
Evans scored a decisive win over Charlie
Dean of the southern club.
On March 25 the Murphyites again
invaded southern territory and went to
defeat at the hands of the Los Angeles
Athletic Club. The previous bouts with
U. S. C. had stimulated the interest of
the local fans to such an extent that the
second show is said to have caused more
interest than any amateur bouts ever
held in Los Angeles. 'Ibis interest was
heightened by the welterweight bout be
tween Bill Burkhart, Cardinal star, and
Charlie Jenkisson of the L. A. A. C. in
which Burkhart carried the fight for
two rounds and then lost in the third.
Jenkisson, who is claimant of the wel
terweight coast championship, was the

favorite with the fans before the bouts
During the first and sccond rounds
Burkhart showed more class than his
opponent and scored a knockdown. He
had Jenkisson in jeopardy twice from
body punches and only lack of experi
ence in finishing a man kept him from
taking the championship. In the third
Jenkisson scored a knockdown on Burk
hart and inexperience again told 011 the
Cardinal man. He was swaying into the
ropes and fighting gamely to recuperate
when Coacli Murphy tossed in the
sponge and stopped the fight.
Brad Simmons did good work against
Aug Gotto only to lose by a close de
cision which was doubtful.
Mark Evans had luck play againsL him
after leading the fight against Norman
Marchmont for three rounds and lost in
:he extra round, which was called. In
the three fights with California, U. S. C.
and L. A. A. C. Evans gave away from
ten to seventeen pounds on each. In the
U. S. C. meet he gave seventeen pounds
in his bout with Charlie Dean and then
put the weighty southerner under with
a technical knockout.
The bout tut ween Mike Hodges and
Johnny de Rita was close all the «»v
through and Hodges lost in the third by
hick of stamina. Walter Bills had the
edge on Adolph Gier, former coast
champion, for two rounds and was
knocked out in the third.
Jitnmie Ross beat Red Parkinson of
the southern club in thorough fashion.
Ross' cleverness and ring generalship
made Parkinson look like a novice and
this decisive victory more than evened
up the defeat by Mattis of U. S. C.
The Cardinal men all lost their figh.s
in the last lound and this may have been
due to the fact that the bouts v ere
staged under the A. A. U. rules which
call for three-minute rounds while all
former bouts have been under the inter
collegiate rules which allow onfy two
minute rounds. The L. A. A. C. men
have always boxed under the A. A. U.
rules and this gave them a decided ad
vantage. Stanford alumni crowded the
auditoriums in both of the southern
meets and each time numbered more
than the outsiders present.

defeat at the hands of the Los Angeles
Athletic Club. The previous bouts with
U. S. C. had stimulated the interest of
the local fans to such an extent that the
second show is said to have caused more
interest than any amateur bouts ever
held in Los Angeles. 'Ibis interest was
heightened by the welterweight bout be
tween Bill Burkhart, Cardinal star, and
Charlie Jenkisson of the L. A. A. C. in
which Burkhart carried the fight for
two rounds and then lost in the third.
Jenkisson, who is claimant of the wel
terweight coast championship, was the

favorite with the fans before the bouts
During the first and sccond rounds
Burkhart showed more class than his
opponent and scored a knockdown. He
had Jenkisson in jeopardy twice from
body punches and only lack of experi
ence in finishing a man kept him from
taking the championship. In the third
Jenkisson scored a knockdown on Burk
hart and inexperience again told 011 the
Cardinal man. He was swaying into the
ropes and fighting gamely to recuperate
when Coacli Murphy tossed in the
sponge and stopped the fight.
Brad Simmons did good work against
Aug Gotto only to lose by a close de
cision which was doubtful.
Mark Evans had luck play againsL him
after leading the fight against Norman
Marchmont for three rounds and lost in
:he extra round, which was called. In
the three fights with California, U. S. C.
and L. A. A. C. Evans gave away from
ten to seventeen pounds on each. In the
U. S. C. meet he gave seventeen pounds
in his bout with Charlie Dean and then
put the weighty southerner under with
a technical knockout.
The bout tut ween Mike Hodges and
Johnny de Rita was close all the «»v
through and Hodges lost in the third by
hick of stamina. Walter Bills had the
edge on Adolph Gier, former coast
champion, for two rounds and was
knocked out in the third.
Jitnmie Ross beat Red Parkinson of
the southern club in thorough fashion.
Ross' cleverness and ring generalship
made Parkinson look like a novice and
this decisive victory more than evened
up the defeat by Mattis of U. S. C.
The Cardinal men all lost their figh.s
in the last lound and this may have been
due to the fact that the bouts v ere
staged under the A. A. U. rules which
call for three-minute rounds while all
former bouts have been under the inter
collegiate rules which allow onfy two
minute rounds. The L. A. A. C. men
have always boxed under the A. A. U.
rules and this gave them a decided ad
vantage. Stanford alumni crowded the
auditoriums in both of the southern
meets and each time numbered more
than the outsiders present.
Coach ring artists won two
out of three meets during the vacation,
defeating California and the University
of Southern California and losing to the
Los Angeles Athletic Club.
In the meet with California at Har
mon Gymnasium on March 11 there
were only three intercollegiate bouts and
the Cardinal glove wielders took all of
them. Mik- Hodges defeated Brennan
of the BllTe and Gold in the 125-pound
class. In the lightweight class Jimtnie
Ross beat Gerson. Bill Burkhart came
through in the welterweight for a vic
tory over Irvine of California.
The exhibition bouts were:
115 pounds—Silverman (C) defeated
Simmons (S).
1 157 pounds—Brown (C) defeated
Evans (S).
158 pounds—Murphy (S) defeated
Cline (C).
Heavyweight — Carter (S) defeated
Aftergut (C).
Murphy took his men to Los Angeles
on March 19 and defeated the U. S. C.
team at the Union League Club to the
tune of three out of five bouts. Brad
Simmons, Cardinal bantamweight, beat
R. V. Wright of the southern squad.
Mike Hodges took a technical knockout
from Max Wright in the featherweight
class. Mattis of U. S. C. received the
decision over Jimtnie Ross in the light
weight division. Fairbanks knocked out
Johnny Lane, the Cardinal welterweight.
Evans scored a decisive win over Charlie
Dean of the southern club.
