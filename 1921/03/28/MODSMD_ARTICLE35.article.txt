# ALDA TO BE NEXT CONCERT ARTIST
## Metropolitan Soprano to Be Heard in Assembly Hall Recital, Friday, April 1st 
### 
Mmc. Frances Alda, Metropolitan so
prano, will appear in concert in the As
sembly Hall next Friday evening, April
1, under the management of Frank W.
Healy.
Mine. Alda is declared by many com
petent critics to be among the foremost
concert sopranos at present before the
public. Her popularity with the Metro
politan audiences has been steadily
growing and she occupies a place there
a* an artist of rare personality, who has
constantly and consistently striven for
improvement. She has been equally suc
cessful on the concert stage, and the
beauty of her voice as well as the versa
tility of her art has made her one of the
leading sopranos in America.
In private life Mme. Alda is the wife
of Giulio Gatti-Casazza, general direc
tor of the Metropolitan Opera House.
She has recently been engaged by Tos
canini, director of the La Scala Opera
House in Milan, Italy, to sing the lead
ing soprana role there in the reopening
performance of the opera house next
year. It was there in 1905 that she
created the role of the heroine in Char
pentier's "Louise," the La Scala then
being under the management of Signor
Gatti-Casazza. From I-a Scala Alda
went to Covent Garden, Buenos Aires,
and then to the Metropolitan Opera
House, where for the past thirteen years
she has had a record of remarkable
successes. However, it has been in the
past two years that Alda gained her
greatest increase in popularity, the
singer evidently developing a new pow<*r
to charm or the public awakening to th.e
realization of merits it had not fully
recognized before.
Tickets for the Alda concert will be
on sale at Crandall's and at the box
office in the Administration Building.
The first twelve rows will be $1.50 and
all other scats will be $1.00.
