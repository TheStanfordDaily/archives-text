# FIVE CONTESTS ARE STAGED BY VARSITY NINE
## Coach Seay's Team Registers Three Victories and Two Defeats During Vacation 
### 
Three victories and two defeats tell
the story of the adventures of Coach
Seay's Stanford baseball varsity dur
ing the interim between examination
and tuition just passed. The wins
were registered from the Santa Clara
Sodality, Letterman Hospital, and the
Santa Clara Varsity nines; the two
defeats were suffered at the hands of
"Our Seals" at their Monterey train
ing camp.
The above record ib one that neither
Coach Seay nor any of the men on
the Cardinal baseball squad need be
ashamed of. The boys showed con
siderable class during the five con
tests and the fact that they were de
feated in two games by one of the
best clubs in the Coast Leaguneed
not worry any of the Cardinal follow
ers.
During the vacation period Seay
practically decided on the line-up he
will use from now on. Draper and
Bundy look like the star battery.
Draper has been pitching a superior
brand of baseball this season and he
should register many wins. Bundy
has been leceiving him in good shape
and his throwing to the bases is much
improved over that of last season.
Next to Draper, George Green has been
displaying the most stuff. Knox, Ha
ley, Nef and Kelly are the other slab
sters who compose the pitching staff.
The infield positions seem to be
pretty well settled with Patterson
playing first, Mitchell at the second
hassock, Kallem caring for the short
patch, and "Lefty" Heckeudorf on third
base. There men compose one of the
slickest infields that has graced the
Cardinal uniform in several years.
Patterson and Heckendorf are there
with the old pepper and ambition and
in neither case is there a lack of na
tural ability. Patterson is going great
guns around first base, while Hecken
dorf is probably the most graceful
third sacker in college baseball today.
The outfield is not so definitely fixed
as the inner circle. Mort Kline is a
fixture in left field. Mortis hitting
in the clean-up position and that is ex
actly what he has been doing in most
of the games. In the field he has been
putting out some high-class left-handed
fly-chasing. Roy Caarver and Earle
Crowe are contesting for the other
outfield job with Carver having the
edge right now. Both are good hitters
but Crowe has not yet rounded into his
top form so that Carver is holding
sway for the time being.
Stanford will play one of its hardest
preliminary games next Wednesday,
when St. Mary's comes to the campus
for an afternoon of baseball. This
Oakland gang has played twenty-six
or twenty-seven games and has lost
but five of the lot. California beat
the Saints last week so it is up to
Seay's men to do likewise.

dorf is probably the most graceful
third sacker in college baseball today.
The outfield is not so definitely fixed
as the inner circle. Mort Kline is a
fixture in left field. Mortis hitting
in the clean-up position and that is ex
actly what he has been doing in most
of the games. In the field he has been
putting out some high-class left-handed
fly-chasing. Roy Caarver and Earle
Crowe are contesting for the other
outfield job with Carver having the
edge right now. Both are good hitters
but Crowe has not yet rounded into his
top form so that Carver is holding
sway for the time being.
Stanford will play one of its hardest
preliminary games next Wednesday,
when St. Mary's comes to the campus
for an afternoon of baseball. This
Oakland gang has played twenty-six
or twenty-seven games and has lost
but five of the lot. California beat
the Saints last week so it is up to
Seay's men to do likewise.
Three victories and two defeats tell
the story of the adventures of Coach
Seay's Stanford baseball varsity dur
ing the interim between examination
and tuition just passed. The wins
were registered from the Santa Clara
Sodality, Letterman Hospital, and the
Santa Clara Varsity nines; the two
defeats were suffered at the hands of
"Our Seals" at their Monterey train
ing camp.
The above record ib one that neither
Coach Seay nor any of the men on
the Cardinal baseball squad need be
ashamed of. The boys showed con
siderable class during the five con
tests and the fact that they were de
feated in two games by one of the
best clubs in the Coast Leaguneed
not worry any of the Cardinal follow
ers.
During the vacation period Seay
practically decided on the line-up he
will use from now on. Draper and
Bundy look like the star battery.
Draper has been pitching a superior
brand of baseball this season and he
should register many wins. Bundy
has been leceiving him in good shape
and his throwing to the bases is much
improved over that of last season.
Next to Draper, George Green has been
displaying the most stuff. Knox, Ha
ley, Nef and Kelly are the other slab
sters who compose the pitching staff.
The infield positions seem to be
pretty well settled with Patterson
playing first, Mitchell at the second
hassock, Kallem caring for the short
patch, and "Lefty" Heckeudorf on third
base. There men compose one of the
slickest infields that has graced the
Cardinal uniform in several years.
Patterson and Heckendorf are there
with the old pepper and ambition and
in neither case is there a lack of na
tural ability. Patterson is going great
guns around first base, while Hecken
dorf is probably the most graceful
third sacker in college baseball today.
