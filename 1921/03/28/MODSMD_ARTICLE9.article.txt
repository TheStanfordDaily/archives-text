# FRESHMAN NINE BEATS SAN MATEO
## Lowenstein on Mound For the Babes Holds High School to Three Counts; Score 12-3 
### 
"Swede" Righter's first-year men
romped away with kne fourth game of
the season Saturday afternoon by
smothering San Mateo high school nine
under a 12 to 3 score. A1 Loewenstein,
pill heaver for the Freshmen, pitched
the whole game and held the visitors
down to a small number of earned hits
although slow work in the outfiield gave
them eight technical hits.
In the first inning Woodward, Hun
eke, Strong and Mertz crossed the rub
ber for tallies and this first assault
seemed to take the pep all out of the
high school chaps. Mertz sprained his
ankle sliding into the plate and Colvin
took his position. The second and third
innings were an even break witii a tally
for both teams in each of the frames,
making the score 6 to 2. Then the
Babes led out with another burst which
netted them four more tallies. This
second advance unloaded the visitors of
what few hopes still lingered and their
coach took the mound in the fifth. De
spite the eight strike outs which lie
gathered in, the Babes chalked up two
more markers while the Mateoites
squeezed through in the ninth with one
more.
The Freshman infiel dis a smooth run
ning machine and shows some rc~l class.
Woodward, Smurr and Huneke played
the same positions together last year on
the Paly High team and arc able to de
liver a good brand of teamwork. Wood
ward is a mighty good man with the
fungo and his two runs, one hit and
three walks arc no bad rccord. Deffen
bock stopped several bingles over the
second sack which arc usually counted
as clean hits and he shows up well with
the stick. Strong gets everything com
ing his way at first. He is no slouch at
the plate and on the bases.
The outfield is weak in every corner
and weak support from this quarter
made a lot of hard work for Loewen-
