# GREEN TO TWIRL WEDNESDAY GAME AGAINST ST. MARY'S
## Oaklanders Have Classy Team and Seay's Nine Will Have to Hustle to Beat Them 
### 
George Green will probably "be on the
mound when Stanford plays the St.
Mary's College nine tomorrow after
noon on the local diamond. Green is
toting a sore arm at present and Guy
Draper is suffering from a felon on his
hand, but of the two Draper is the least
able to take his turn on the hill, so it
looks as if Green will have to do the
hurling.
The Varsity baseball team suffered
less from the ravages of probation than
any of the other athletic teams. But
one man was ruled off by the scholar
ship committee and his place will be
filled nicely with the material now on the
squad.
Coach Seay expects to hand the Saints
a beating tomorrow despite the fact that
his pitching staff is temporarily hors
dc combat. The Oakland contingent
started off with a hang, but in the last
few games have appeared to be stale.
Their defeat at the hands of the Blue
and Gold Varsity last week told plainly
that they are suffering from overwork.
But, at that, they are rated as one of the
best college nines on the Pacific Coast
and the Seayites will have to hustle
throughout the game to beat them.
Schnell will probably start the game
for the Collegians, with Hadley in re
serve. Since the departure of "Wee"
Ludolph to the Seals' training catnp at
Monterey, Schnell has been doing most
of the heaving for St. Mary's and has
been very successful. Hadley is the
other choice for pitching duty.
Captain Douglas Bundy will be be
hind the log tomorrow. Bundy is
catching in improved style this year and
is also garnering his bingles regularly.
Patterson will hold down the first
corner of the diamond, with "Lcftv"
Heckendorf playing the opposite role at
third base. Mitchell and Kallam will
perform around the keystone bag. With
these men playing the brand of baseball
of which they are capablc the inner
works should he well protected. Inci
dentally, any one of the quartet can be
figured on to provide a few base knocks
when the team is on the offensive.
Mitchell is one of the healthiest slug
gers on the team and Patterson has also
been gathering his blows with frequency.
Kallam and Heckendorf round out a
group of hitters that are dangerous at
all times.
Kline, Crowe and Carver will guard
the outer gardens. Kline and Carver are
experienced outfielders, while Crowe,
who was formerly an in fielder, is show
ing plenty of class in the pastures. All
of these men are good hitters.
With this aggregation representing
the Cardinal on the field it is the duty
of every Stanford man and woman to
attend the game tomorrow to support
them. The Varsity is putting out the
classiest brand of baseball that has been
displayed on this campus in several
moons and suns, but athletic followers
have failed to recognize this fact. One
visit to the local ball orchard will prob
ably convince and convert the doubting
Thomases into rabid baseball fans.
