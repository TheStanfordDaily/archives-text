# STANFORD QUAD NOW IN PRINTERS' HANDS; LAST CHANCE TO BUY
## 
### 
The University Press started work
last week on the printing and arrange
ment of the 1922 Stanford Quad and
work is going rapidly forward in that
connection.
They announce that part of the Col
lege Year and the University sections
have already been run off the press, as
well as all the borders which arc to be
used in the book. This year instead of
the traditional four insert sheets there
will be six, and these too have been
finished. Also the volume will contain
six tinted reproduced etchings, designed
by Pedro J. Lemos, the Stanford pro
fessor whose work in this respect has
brought him national renown. A num
ber of years ago he founded the Etch
ing Society of California.
This week the tryoutees for the man
agership of the 1923 Quad are canvassing
the campus for the sale of this year's
book. The price is $5.50 for a regular
fabricord binding; $8.50 insures a full
calfskin cover with the purchaser's
name stamped in gold in the lower cor
ner. Reservation should be made at
once as there is only a limited number
of these year books available.
