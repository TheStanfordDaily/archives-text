# JUNIORS GIVE SECOND DANCE FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE WOMEN'S CLUB
## 
### 
Nineteen twenty-two will open its
spring season of festivities Friday night
with a dance in the Women's Club
House. This will be the second of the
Junior Dances of the year and will be
the last of the parties given by the third
year class before its big offering of the
year in Junior Week when the Prom
and Opera will be given.
The dance will be a straight program
affair and will probably be a 1 o'clock.
Those who came to the last one will re
member the good syncopation that was
furnished for the evening. This time
the best available has been selected by
the class. Ambrose Whitmer with his
troupe of popular melody purveyors will
furnish the music for the entertainment.
He will have his regular orchestra with
some additions to th"? lineup.
The date has been reserved for the
Juniors since early in the winter quarter
and the committee in charge of the
dance has gone to considerable trouble
to insure a pleasant evening for th<*
participants. The last dance was some
thing out of the ordinary in the way of
campus functions, and this one will be
original also. The springtime that is
here now will characterize the decora
tions, and the party will be a regular
spring dance, made as near like a tennis
dance as possible. Light clothes will be
the order of the evening.
Willit Dorian is heading the commit
tee on the dance again and has the gen
eral plans for the evening worked out.
The exact admission has not been de
termined, but it will probably be one
dollar for the 9 to 1 dance.
