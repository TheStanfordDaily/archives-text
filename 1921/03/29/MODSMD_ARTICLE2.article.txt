# FRESHMAN NINE TO MEET OAKLAND HIGH TEAM ON WEDNESDAY
## Outfield is Freshmen's Weak Point; Opportunity There for New Playersâ€”Righter 
### 
A fast baseball game is scheduled for
Wednesday when the Stanford Fresh-
Men taeti the bat-wielders from Oakland
High School. "Swede" Righter's men
are rapidly working into form and with
added confidence after winning from
San Mateo High Saturday should he
able to come out at the big end of the
score when they meet the bunch from
the bay.
The outfiield is Stanford's weak
point. The first-year men worked out
for five innings against the Varsity last
night in which the held its own,
playing practically an errorless game.
However, when the Varsity men were
able to knock the ball into the outfield
they were able to make three-baggers or
home nins. Righter appeals to all men
eligible for the Freshman team to try
out for positions in the out field. "There
is a big opportunity there for men with
any talent at all to make the team," he
said. "It doesn't make any difference
whether or not you have ever played
baseball, come out any way. There is
undoubtedly lots of undeveloped talent
in the University and all that is needed
is to get it out on the field."
The first-year men arc handicapped by
the fact that several players have been
placed on probation which prevents their
taking part in athletics. Fuller has been
catching in Holmes' place after Holmes
sprained his ankle in the game Satur
day and is still a little nervous in a close
play but rapidly getting accustomed to
the position. However, Bill Holmes is
expected back in a suit along at the end
of the week.
