# COUNT ON DISAPPOINTMENT

"Count on contradiction and disappointment as a necessary part in
the program of life," said the late Cardinal Gibbons in an Easter mes
sage to the youth of America through the American magazine. The
saddest note of the Easter vacation undoubtedly came with the death of
the beloved leader, and his words are the rpore important for being the
last he will ever speak, yet no man has given a clearer word of encour
agement to the college generation of today.
"]>e tolerant," he said; ''forget the prejudices that separate you
from other men. Again and again I! have seen men start out in life
selfishly to get all they could for themselves, and in the end they are
baffled and puzzled. They can't understand why with all their striving
they have been surpassed by men who apparently have neglected their
own selfish interests to render real service."
Yet, Cardinal Gibbons emphasized, "Expect great things. No
great thing ever comes to an man unless he has courage, even in dark
days, to expect-great things; to expect them of himself, of his fellow
men, of America, and of God."
The success of the great American leader argues well for the
phiiosophy which he presents.
