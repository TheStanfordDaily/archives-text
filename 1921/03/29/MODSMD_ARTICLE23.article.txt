# THEY WORK TOMORROW

Although Coach Duffy Seay's baseball squad has rounded into an
organization of real diamond artists, probably four-fifths of the Stan
ford students have not seen the team in action. There is nothing medi
ocre about the nine that will line up against the combination from St.
Mary's tomorrow on the Stanford field. Supporters of the Cardinal
athletic standardwwil t be glad of the first real opportunity to sec the
1021 Stanford baseball team in a contest that promises sti(T competition.
St. Mary's nine is competent. It was for some time coached by
Walter Mails, and has several victories to its credit. A win by the
varsity tomorrow will indicate its ability to take care of itself properly
in the coming California contest.
Students who care for a baseball contest in which players take the
ball cleanly, handle themselves neatly, and play the game "upstairs"
as well as otherwise will not be disappointed in the closely contested
battle which should take place before thc'Stanford bleachers tomorrow.
