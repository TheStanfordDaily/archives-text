# ECONOMIC SIDE OF WORK INTERESTS GUIDO MARX
## 
### 
Broader fields of research, especi
ally in relation to the trend of higher
education occupy the time that Guido
Marx has left from his duties strictly
as one of the professors of the Me
chanical Engineering
and the interest that he has shown in
relation to the wider aspect of edu
cation has made him well-known
throughout the country. The broader
economic aspect of engineering is a
subject in which he is interested great
ly, and which he believes occupies a
place of paramount importance in the
whole field of world reconstruction.
Professor Marx was born in Toledo,
Ohio, March 29, 1871. He finished his
preliminary school training in the
High and Manual Training Schools of
Toledo. As soon as he had graduated,
his family moved to Rochester, N.Y.,
where he went into commercial work,
and where he had a good opportunity
to learn business methods and aims.
After two years in this position,he
went to Cornell, and although at first
not intending to do so, stayed there
for four years and received his M.E.
degree.
Returning to Rochester for one year,
he was employed by the Reason
works, machine tool manufacturers,
where he got his first introduction to
gearing, a subject in which he has
been especially interested ever since.
To get variation he went to Phila
delphia and while with the Bement
Miles & Co., machine tool manufac
turers, received a telegram from Pro
fessor A. W. Smith, head of the me
chanical engineering department at
Stanford. This telegram asked him
to come to California and accept, an
instructorship in the new university.
This was in 1895. Professor Marx
immediately accepted, came out to the
coast, and has been here at Stanford
since that timo, making him the old
est in point of service on the mechan
ical engineering staff.
Teaching as a service, with the hu
man side of it always emphasized is
the viewpoint of Professor Marx. He
looks upon his students, not in a pure
ly mechanical way, but as people who
have come to him to have their
thought processes shaped as best he j
can to prepare them for future prob- j
lems and emergencies that they may j
meet in their particular line of work, j
He believes in teaching them first, to i

observe accurately; second, to reason
directly and logically; and third, to
express themselves in some manner—
to react clearly* to the former pro
cesses. Also, his work does not end
when his students leave their class
rooms, for he is many times of great
assistance in procuring positions for
them, and can, besides, fill demands
from the outside for mechanical engi
neers. The type of engineers he
turns out is strikingly illustrated by
the fact that last year Stanford stu
dents made a dean sweep of the three
prizes given by the American Society
of Engineers, and another first prize
was won a few years ago. No other
institution in the country has been
able to capture more than one prize
since the Society was founded.
"Machine Design," a standard text,
written by Professor A. W. Smith and
Guido Marx, the later revision being
wholly the latter's work, is a good
sample of Marx's literary work. He
has contributed at various times to
the Atlantic, Nation, Science, and to
many technical journals. Many of his
writings have been in connection with
the trend of higher education and the
economic side of mechanical engineer
ing. Last year he was asked to come
to the new school for social research
established in New York City, to give
a course there. This is a conference
group to study into the factors stand
ing in the way of free utilization of
national resources for the satisfaction
of public needs. Prof. Marx has found
this to be a broad field.
In a purely technical way, much of
his efforts have been directed along
research and experimentation in re
gard to gearing. The strength of
gearing and experiments on wear are
especially in his field, although he has
not been able to spare much time to
this time'of hiR work for the last year
or two, since the war.
Mountain tramping, although by no
means his only exercise, is Prof. Marx's
favorite diversion during leisure
time. He has climbed in the Sierras
around the King and Kern river cany
ons, and has a cabin at Fallen Leaf,
near Tahoe, where he has been spend
ing his last few summers. He played
on the faculty baseball team, while
tlierp was such an organization, and
wields a. jacket on the tennis courts.
And he admits that he enjoys greatly
a game of billiards or bridge.

And he admits that he enjoys greatly
a game of billiards or bridge.
Broader fields of research, especi
ally in relation to the trend of higher
education occupy the time that Guido
Marx has left from his duties strictly
as one of the professors of the Me
chanical Engineering
and the interest that he has shown in
relation to the wider aspect of edu
cation has made him well-known
throughout the country. The broader
economic aspect of engineering is a
subject in which he is interested great
ly, and which he believes occupies a
place of paramount importance in the
whole field of world reconstruction.
Professor Marx was born in Toledo,
Ohio, March 29, 1871. He finished his
preliminary school training in the
High and Manual Training Schools of
Toledo. As soon as he had graduated,
his family moved to Rochester, N.Y.,
where he went into commercial work,
and where he had a good opportunity
to learn business methods and aims.
After two years in this position,he
went to Cornell, and although at first
not intending to do so, stayed there
for four years and received his M.E.
degree.
Returning to Rochester for one year,
he was employed by the Reason
works, machine tool manufacturers,
where he got his first introduction to
gearing, a subject in which he has
been especially interested ever since.
To get variation he went to Phila
delphia and while with the Bement
Miles & Co., machine tool manufac
turers, received a telegram from Pro
fessor A. W. Smith, head of the me
chanical engineering department at
Stanford. This telegram asked him
to come to California and accept, an
instructorship in the new university.
This was in 1895. Professor Marx
immediately accepted, came out to the
coast, and has been here at Stanford
since that timo, making him the old
est in point of service on the mechan
ical engineering staff.
Teaching as a service, with the hu
man side of it always emphasized is
the viewpoint of Professor Marx. He
looks upon his students, not in a pure
ly mechanical way, but as people who
have come to him to have their
thought processes shaped as best he j
can to prepare them for future prob- j
lems and emergencies that they may j
meet in their particular line of work, j
He believes in teaching them first, to i

observe accurately; second, to reason
directly and logically; and third, to
express themselves in some manner—
to react clearly* to the former pro
cesses. Also, his work does not end
when his students leave their class
rooms, for he is many times of great
assistance in procuring positions for
them, and can, besides, fill demands
from the outside for mechanical engi
neers. The type of engineers he
turns out is strikingly illustrated by
the fact that last year Stanford stu
dents made a dean sweep of the three
prizes given by the American Society
of Engineers, and another first prize
was won a few years ago. No other
institution in the country has been
able to capture more than one prize
since the Society was founded.
"Machine Design," a standard text,
written by Professor A. W. Smith and
Guido Marx, the later revision being
wholly the latter's work, is a good
sample of Marx's literary work. He
has contributed at various times to
the Atlantic, Nation, Science, and to
many technical journals. Many of his
writings have been in connection with
the trend of higher education and the
economic side of mechanical engineer
ing. Last year he was asked to come
to the new school for social research
established in New York City, to give
a course there. This is a conference
group to study into the factors stand
ing in the way of free utilization of
national resources for the satisfaction
of public needs. Prof. Marx has found
this to be a broad field.
In a purely technical way, much of
his efforts have been directed along
research and experimentation in re
gard to gearing. The strength of
gearing and experiments on wear are
especially in his field, although he has
not been able to spare much time to
this time'of hiR work for the last year
or two, since the war.
Mountain tramping, although by no
means his only exercise, is Prof. Marx's
favorite diversion during leisure
time. He has climbed in the Sierras
around the King and Kern river cany
ons, and has a cabin at Fallen Leaf,
near Tahoe, where he has been spend
ing his last few summers. He played
on the faculty baseball team, while
tlierp was such an organization, and
wields a. jacket on the tennis courts.
And he admits that he enjoys greatly
a game of billiards or bridge.
