# LOCAL POLO SQUAD ENJOYS SUCCESSFUL WEEK AT DEL MONTE
## 
### 
The Stanford polo squad has returned
from a successful trip to Del Monte and
Monterey, where they were the guests of
the Eleventh Cavalry during the recent
vacation. Although they were beaten in
their games with the Eleventh Cavalry
team, the Stanford team gained a fund
of valuable experience that will serve
them in future contests
With Major Collins in charge, the
regular four, with substitutes, journeyed
to Monterey last Tuesday in an army
reconaissance bus, and upon their ar
rival were quartered in the barracks
occupied by the cavalry regiment.
Horses were furnished for the Stanford
four from among the Eleventh's string
of polo ponies and this worked out as a
disadvantage to the Stanford team, as
they are accustomed to the mounts from
the stables of the local artillery unit.
The Stanford contingent was able to
witness some first-class polo in the East
vs. West tournament -which was being
held at Del Monte during the past week,
with such teams as the Point Judith
Tigers and the Del Monte four battling
for the title. From these games the local
squad was able to gather some pointers
that will greatly aid in the development
of their team. Tn addition to being
guests at the polo tournament, the Stan
ford players were treated to various
other forms of entertainment, such as
rides through the country adjacent to
Del Monte and the Monterey reserva
tion.
