# MME. MARIE CURIE TO BE PRESENTED WITH RADIUM GIFT
## 
### 
The President's Office has received
a request for support iu the plan to
Madame Marie Curie, the discoverer
oÂ£ radium, a gramme of that precious
metal, on the of her visit to
America soon.
Madame Curie, although she dis
covered radium, possesses none of it
herself. It has proved to be a most
effective cure for cancer, and with the
gramme which will be given her she
proposes to make a personal study of
the effects of this substance on cancer
in her laboratory in Franoe. Since
cancer is the cause of a very large
proportion of deaths among women,
a committee of women has undertaken
to raise the money needed to purchase
the gram of radium for her experi
ments, and colleges which have wo
men students are being especially
asked to contribute to the fund.
Heretofore most of the application
of radium to cancer has been carried
on by physicians, but it is believed
that Madame Curie's knowledge of the
nature of radium and the substances
into which it changes will enable her
to make new discoveries.
