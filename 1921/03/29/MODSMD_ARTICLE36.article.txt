# JOFFRE MEDAL TOPIC AMERICAN IN APPEAL
## 
### 
"France and the Treaty of Versailles,"
the general question for the Joffre inter
collegiate debate with California in the
Assembly Hall Saturday evening, un
doubtedly forms the livest and most in
teresting of Joffre questions which have
been selected in recent years. Occa
sionally the question for the extempore
debate has been so confined to purely
French policy that, the interest of an
American audience was not aroused by
the subject.
The Versailles treaty in its many im
plications is closely related to the con
troversial subjects of American politics.
Saturday's discussion, though made
from the French standpoint, will deal
with subjects which have filled the pages
of American newspapers and magazines
for the past three years.
The broad scope of the general sub
ject will permit the selection of any
number of specific questions. Two hours
before the first speaker takes the plat
form the specific question will be an
nounced and the sides which the debaters
support will be determined. Possibly
the controversy over reparation will be
the basis for Saturday's contest. Even
this subject is capable of subdivision
into a number of questions, as repara
tion has many aspects which call for in
dividual solution.
The trio which California will send
into the contest will be one of the
strongest which has lately represented
her in intercollegiate debating.
