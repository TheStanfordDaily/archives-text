# REV. LLOYD DOUGLAS GIVES IMPRESSIONS OF STANFORD CAMPUS
## 
### 
Rev. Lloyd Douglas, who recently
spent several days visiting on the
Stanford campus, has returned to his
homo in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The
! following excerpt from the "Michi
gan Daily," the student publication of
I the state university gives Douglas'
impressions of life on this campus:
"Students of the Leland Stanford
university in Palo Alto, California,
three-fourths of whom are men, spend
most of their leisure time out-of
doors," iis the report of Rev. Lloyd
Douglas of the Congregational church
of this city, who has just returned
from a visit to the California school.
In speaking of the athletics at Stan
ford, Rev. Douglas said: "I do not be
lieve from my personal observation
that the students at Stanford take
their athletics as seriously as college
men of the Middle West.
Interest in Dramatics
"So far as I could observe," said
Dr. Douglas, "the general moral con
ditions existing at Leland Stanford is
neither better nor worse than in any
first class university which has come
into my range of vision. There is a
remarkable interest in dramatics and
the students as well as the faculty out
there soem to incline more to dra
matics than they have at any institu
tions which I have yet visited. I saw
a rendition of the 'Yellow Jacket' put
on by students and it compared quite
favorably with professional perform
ances.
"One of the most interesting tradi
tions," continued Rev. Douglas, "which
were pointed out to me is the custom
of each graduating class to remove a
block of stone flagging from the pave
ment of a prominent court, and to
deposit the class history, colors and
all relics of that particular class into
the opening; the flagging is then de
stroyed and in its place a plate of
bronze bearing the class numerals is
inserted. This unique custom has
been continued since 1894 and the
bronze plates form an unbroken line
in front of the Memorial chapel.
Not 'Pagan' at Stanford
"Religiously Stanford boasts of her
self as being 'pagan.' I am disposed
to think that most of this is pose. Al
though only a small percentage of the
faculty attend church this does not
signify that they are irreligious."
