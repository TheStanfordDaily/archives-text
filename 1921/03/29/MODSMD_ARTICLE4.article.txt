# CARNIVAL WILL HAVE NOVEL DECORATIONS
## Canvas Instead of Beaver Board Will Be Used For Walls; Art Director Busy 
### 
The construction of the concessions
at the Carnival this year will be of
frame with stretched canvas on the
sides* according to the statement made
today by J. E. Simpson, '21, financial
director, and Ben S. Parks, '20, con
struction manager. Parks and Simp
son have been in San Francisco valu
ing the different types of siding that
have been considered for the conces
sions and have found that the only
\pne that seems satisfactory is can
vas. Beaver board mats from the
newspaper offices have been found to
be unsatisfactory due to the diffculty
in the nailing. The preliminary work
on construction at the Carnival en
closure will start very soon, says
Parks. It is his idea to get the fram
ing up for the outside walls of the
concessions and the street lines at. an
early date and then allow the con
cessionaries more time to finish the
Interior decorating of the individual
places.
Director of Art Work, Ed Farmer,
'23, bas been working hard on a gener
al scheme of decoration for the entire
setting of the carnival. He has a
Spanish city laid out now in miniature,
and this will to a great extent be fol
lowed in the making of the ground
plan of the carnival. The narrow
streets that mark the quaint cities of
southern Spain along the Mediterrane
an Sea are faithfully portrayed in the
miniature and all the forms of archi
tecture that are peculiar to the Latin
countries will be found in the en
closure.
The different groups on the campus
are responding well to the call for
entries. They will have the final in
structions Thursday afternoon in the
Little Theater. The songs for the en
tertainers must also be in by the end
of the week In order that they may be
orchestrated for the musical groups
that will be one of the carnival feat
ures.
