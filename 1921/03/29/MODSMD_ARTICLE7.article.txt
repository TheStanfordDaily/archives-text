# AXE FALLS, COACH TEMPLETON LOSES FRESHMEN STARS
## Glen Hartranft, Clarke, Bowers, Arthur Out of "S"-"C" Track Meet on April Ninth 
### 
Chances for the Stanford freshmen
to defeat the California babes in track
at Berkeley a week from Saturday,
which had seemed unusually bright
this year, received a severe set-back
over spring vacation when the faculty
axe removed several of "Dink" Temp
leton's strongest men from further
competition this season.
Glen Hartranft, conceded two first
places in the clash of the two 1924
classes with a strong possibility of
his taking several seconds and thirds;
Clarke, quarter miler, who won the
Southern Interscholastic last year;
Bowers, one of the most promising
weight men Stanford has had since
Reg Caughey and "Here" Bihlman and
Jim Arthur, weight man and jumper,
Will all be out of the big "little
meet."
The removal of at least twenty-five
points from the Cardinal freshman
column practically wrecks Temple
ton's underclass team. Eddie Sudden,
the sensational sprinter, Ludeke, a
consistent weight man and high jump
er, Harvey Coverly, middle-distance
runnen, Mcintosh, who has been tra
veling over the half in godd time, and
Scofield, pole vaulter and quarter
miler, practically complete the rem
nants of one of the strongest looking
freshman teams that Stanford has ever
boasted.
The registration of Ralph Shermund,
speedy Olympic Club 440 man will
help fill the vacancy left by Clark's
ineligibility, but Templeton will have
a hard time filling up the loss of
Bowers and Hartranft.
The only loss the varsity sustained
was the removal oÂ£ Elliott, distance
man, who had been figured to break
into the one, two, three combination
of the Bruin milers, Sprott, Mejia and
Wentworth.
With the big meet only two weeks
from Saturday, Coach Templeton will
Start a final drive this week to whip
his men into the best of shape. Pomo
na College will bring a team north
for a meet here. The chief
interest in this affair will be centered
in the hurdle races when Daggs, who
has cleaned up the south this year
toes the mark with Jess Wells, and
Bob Williams of Stanford. Moreman,
a miler, has a record of 4:30 in his
event.
