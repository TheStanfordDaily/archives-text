## Curtiss Oriole Will Be Here For Two Days and Make Trips Single or Double 
### 
Plans have hern made to conduct the
carnival in the air as well as in the en
closure by the gymnasium. An aeroplane
will be on the campus for the two days
of the spring celebration, and will carry
passengers here among the students and
visitors at the Carnival. The ship is to
cost the Carnival $100 an hour flying
while here and will be operated on a
basis consistent with this price.
An arrangement for selling the tickets
to the flights has been made whereby
individual and pairs of tickets will be
raffled off to the different groups among
the University people, and will enable
flight to be made by the lucky ones for
a As it is now the flights
will cost about ten dollars. They will
be for longer periods than the regular
flights that are usually held at fairs and
celebrations of a like kind. The Curtiss
Oriole type that is to be used is one of
the neatest of biplanes that are now
j being operated and will carry two pas
sengers on the (lights at once.
Longer flights may be made by special
j arrangement with the flier while he is
I here- Special prize trips will be one of
| the features of the Carnival celebration
| and will be made in the afternoons,
! Whether there will be night flying has
not been definitely decided as yet be
cause the landing field here is not well
I suited to night work.
