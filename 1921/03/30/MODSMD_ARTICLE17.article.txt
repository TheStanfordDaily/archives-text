# A 						STADIUM FOR 1922
## 
### 
Students who see the 1922 California Stanford football game in a
stadium worthy of the battle between the Cardinal and the Blue and
(lold will realize the fondest hopes supporters of university athletics
have held for many years. The advantages of the stadium are obvious.
Financially, morally, and materially it will bolster and build Stanford
athletics of the immediate future.
A stadium of wood and earth embankment instead of concrete will
materially reduce the initial cost of the structure without detracting from
the general attractiveness. The use of wood will make the bowl more
comfortable for spectators. The cost of wood brings the possibility of
immediate construction, and it is found that wood may be regularly re
placed at a cost less than that of concrete. It is found, too, that the
using of wood will enable the Hoard of Control to spend a great deal
more on Stanford Athletics following the erection of the stadium than
otherwise would be possible. The permanent re-establishment of crew
should follow the success of the stadium. Concrete may replace the
wood if later it is thought desirable.
The plan calls for breaking of ground within two months, and ex
cavation before the fall rains. The following spring the construction
will be taken up and finished in time for the November game with Cali
fornia.
But all this is dependent on the response to letters sent out by the
Board of Control to alumni and friends of Stanford. In the first mail
since the sending of the letters $1,400 was received.
Students themselves have not been asked and have not yet offered
to contribute financially to the building of the stadium. In any event
they will not be expected to furnish any large amount. Yet every one
of the more than two thousand registered students has a certain amount
of influence with members of the alumni and friends of Stanford, and
an effort on their part to indicate in every instance the importance of the
stadium campaign to Stanford should have more than a little effect in
the response to the letters of the Board of Control.

IS THERE ANY SIGNIFICANCE in the observation by the Rev.
Lloyd Douglas of Michigan that Stanford students spent their leisure
out of doors, take less interest or less serious interest in athletics than
universities of the Middle West, and that in dramatics he finds a partic
ularly noticeable spirit ?
Is Stanford changing, or did the visitor notice those things in which
he was most interested ?
