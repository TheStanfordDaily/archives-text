-Dear Sir:—There are some people who

course of physical nature. There are
others who doubt this-. Win not settle
the question by honestly putting it to the
authoritative test of human experience?
Tyndall once suggested a "prayer
gauge" as a test of material efficacy'
Crookes suggested a test which should
add one ten thousandth of a grain to .a
balance-pan in a sealed case. (lalton
collected statistics on the objective effi
cacy of prayer. These experiments, in
tended to test miraculous intervl-ntions,
never yielded positive results.
I propose the following non-miracu
lous test. Let one, or several, with
faith in the potency of prayer to change
the order of inanimate nature, pray for
three hundred or more heads and then
toss a penny live hundred times. The
praying person, three other responsible
persons, and myself will observe and
tabulate the number of heads.
If five hundred prayers are said, onh
fifty need be answered, as the other two
hundred and fifty heads can be expected
by chance. On the other hand, I am
assured, there are only thirty-three pos
sibilities in ten millimi of getting three
hundred heads by chance alone in five
hundred throws.
If the experiment succeeds, 1 will give
three hundred dollars ($30*100) to the
Hoover Relief Funds for starving F.uro
pean students. The success of this ex
periment, therefore, means the conserva
tion of thirty human lives, enlightened
students of today, intelligent leaders of
tomorrow.
Any One is eligible for this trial who

-Dear Sir:—There are some people who
believe that mental prayer can alter the
course of physical nature. There are
others who doubt this-. Win not settle
the question by honestly putting it to the
authoritative test of human experience?
Tyndall once suggested a "prayer
gauge" as a test of material efficacy'
Crookes suggested a test which should
add one ten thousandth of a grain to .a
balance-pan in a sealed case. (lalton
collected statistics on the objective effi
cacy of prayer. These experiments, in
tended to test miraculous intervl-ntions,
never yielded positive results.
I propose the following non-miracu
lous test. Let one, or several, with
faith in the potency of prayer to change
the order of inanimate nature, pray for
three hundred or more heads and then
toss a penny live hundred times. The
praying person, three other responsible
persons, and myself will observe and
tabulate the number of heads.
If five hundred prayers are said, onh
fifty need be answered, as the other two
hundred and fifty heads can be expected
by chance. On the other hand, I am
assured, there are only thirty-three pos
sibilities in ten millimi of getting three
hundred heads by chance alone in five
hundred throws.
If the experiment succeeds, 1 will give
three hundred dollars ($30*100) to the
Hoover Relief Funds for starving F.uro
pean students. The success of this ex
periment, therefore, means the conserva
tion of thirty human lives, enlightened
students of today, intelligent leaders of
tomorrow.
Any One is eligible for this trial who
will publicly affirm that he or she has
prayed with llrin faith.
