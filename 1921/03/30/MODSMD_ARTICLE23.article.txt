# T. T. C. GREGORY, '99, WRITES OF AUSTRIAN WORK UNDER HOOVER
## 
### 
T. T. Gregory, '99, member of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, has begun
a series of articles in the World's Work
which will cover his experiences while
in Austria under Herbert Hoover, '95.
The series will extend through several
issues, the first one appearing this
month. He vividly describes the differ
ent of the great capital of the
Hnpsburgs before and after the last
great struggle. He says, in his intro
duction. "No city blazing with lights,
humming with the buzz of laughter and
gay voices, resplendent with the cos
tumes and the decorations of all the
capitals, palpitating with fetes, balls and
banquets. The wheel of fortune had
swung through a hundred years. We
were met by a people the vast bulk of
which was wasted by the ravages of war
and of privation; streets were naked of
vehicular traffic, palaces were closedâ€”
there was the sound of the shuffling feet
of a thousand men out of work, out of
food, without wamtli. and almost with
out hope!"
