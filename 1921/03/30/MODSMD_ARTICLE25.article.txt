Spring Brings Blossoms
Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pick
ford have been paying a little visit in
S in Francisco on tln-ir way hack to Los
.Angeles from their honeymoon in Eu
rope. Douglas has a blossoming mous
tache which lie i*; training for his next
picture, which will he the "Three Mus
keteers."
Disapproval of Short Skirts
Speaking of Douglas and Mary, they
tell us that they don't approve of the
length of the women's skirts in San
Francisco. After visiting Paris it's
strange they would notice such tilings,
hut perhaps they got a little of the Blue
j Law germ in their systems before reacli-
I ing the West.,
Theatrical Work Shop
Gordon Davis is giving another course
this quarter that should be particularly
interesting to those interested in theatri
cals. It is called the Theatrical Work
shop and the class will be formed into
a theatrical company and every Tuesday
different theatre folks will come from
San Francisco and talk to the class. The
work will be practical and up to date-
Faculty Gives Play
F.ven our Faculty is developing the
dramatic bug. We hear they gave quite
a creditable performance in their Faculty
play the last of the quarter, but as we
couldn't beg our way in, we haven't
much to say about it.
