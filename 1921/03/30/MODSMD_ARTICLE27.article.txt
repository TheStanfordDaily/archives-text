Leonard Carlsruith, the "hard luck
guy" of the varsity track squad is
once again stepping off the half and
; the mile. He did his first running of
| £he season yesterday in the four- lap
! event, placing third without difficulty.
; was first laid up by illness,
| then broke his nose and climated that
with tho mumps. Last season he was
in poor shape most of the season but
came through in the Pacific Coast
Conference Meet by placing third in
a 1:58 race in the half. Before he
was taken sick, Carlsmith was running
five seconds faster than he was last
year.
Guy Draper, Seay's best bet on the
hill, underwent an operation for a
felon on his hand at the Peninsula
Hospital this morning. Draper, who
had been groomed to start against
California here Saturday, will hardly
be in shape to take his place, it is
said.
Members of "Dink" Templeton's
1924 track squad meet at the Union
tonight to select their skipper for the
rest of the season. Eddie Sudden,
the speedy little dash man, is said
rto be favored for the job.
Ralph Shermund, the Olympic Club
quarter miler, who attempted to re
gister at Stanford this quarter, found
that several names had preceded his
in M*e waiting list and so "Dink"
Templeton lost a valuable man to his
partly wrecked freshman aggregation.
"Red" Tauzer was in good form with
the discus yesterday, tossing the Greek
affair several times past the 125-foot
mark.
Claude Peavy, second-sacker on the
1923 baseball team, reported for prac
tice yesterday to Duffy Seay. Peavy
was ineligible last quarter. If he is
in any kind of shape, this boy should
help the varsity a great deal before
the end of the season as he is known
as a mighty sweet infielder.
Walter Christie, veteran coach of
the University of California, was out
.'on the track yesterday looking over
things.
"Brick" Morse has had a lot to say
about the ten flat performances of
Bob Hutchinson of the Bruins this
year but the editor of this column
doesn't hesitate to remark that Bob
will have to go 9:3-5 or better if he
expects to take off the honors in the
I)ig meet after watching old man
Kirksey's boy move his legs yesterday.
