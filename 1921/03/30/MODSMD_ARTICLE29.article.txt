# Varsity Tennis Squad Meets Pomona Team on Local Courts Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Varsity tennis squad will play its
first match of the season on the Encina
courts tomorrow afternoon against the
Pomona College team, which is rated as
one of the fastest teams in the South.
The matches will consist of three singles
and two doubles and will start promptly
at 3 o'clock.
Jones, Bush and Raeger are scheduled
to represent the southerners and this
trio has been playing a brand of tennis
which puts them in the front ranks of the
tennis world on the Pacific Coast.
The Cardinal team will be picked from
J. M. Davits, P. F. Neer, S. E. Turner,
1-'. M. Tussling and L. S. Fish. Davies
and Neer are veterans at the game and
need no introduction to local enthusiasts
of the net. Davies is in prime form and
both his offensive and defensive work is
of championship caliber.
Neer, as champion of ()regon and one
of the foremost in the ranks of coast
players, delivers an offensive game which
makes him dangerous to face. For the
last month lie has been out of the play
with an injured knee, but should be in
good shape tomorrow. These two men
should set a pace which will make the
much-touted southerners swing hard to
keep up.
Both Varsity and Freshman teams
have been going through stiff practice in
preparation for the coming meets with
California. The Cardinal Varsity will
meet the Blue and Gold on April loth on
the Fncina courts. The Stanford Babes
are to meet the California Freshmen in
Berkeley on April 9th.
The Freshman squad is showing up
well with Hinckley, Mertz, Deßach,
Mcnnoccir, Leeds and XlcHose among
the first ranks. Unless some very prom
ising material is uncovered the team will
be chosen from these men.
