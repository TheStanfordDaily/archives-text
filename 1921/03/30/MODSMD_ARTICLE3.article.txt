# PADDOCK BEATS KIRKSEY IN TWO CLOSE DASHES
## Southern California Crack Once More Breaks Marks in Two Close Contests with Cardinal Captain 
### 
The two fastest sprinters in the world,
Charley Paddock of the University of
Southern California and Captain Morris
Kirksey of Stanford, met again yester
day and 1500 spectators saw one world
record broken and one equaled. Pad
dock, "the fastest human," was the vic
tor in both the hundred and the two
twenty.
The Southern California phenom was
timed again over the century in 9:3-5,
equaling the mark jointly held by Drew,
C raig and Wefers. In the furlong, Pad
dock set a new mark of 21 flat. The old
mark was 21:1. Last Saturday against
California, the Trojan speed merchant
was clocked in 20:4-5, but it is doubtful
if this mark will stand as skeptics claim
there was a wind blowing at the time
which aided Paddock.
There seems little doubt but that
Paddock's mark yesterday will be ap
proved by A. A. U. officials- There was
not the semblance of a breeze blowing
when the men toed the mark and none
of the watches caught the Trojan slower
than 21 flat.
The hundred was the best race seen
here in many years. Both Kirksey and
Paddock got of? to a perfect start. At
the twenty-five yard mark the two men
were running neck and neck. At the
fifty mark the Stanford captain seemed

to be a foot ahead. He held it to the
eighty yard mark, where the Southern
California!! with a terrific burst of speed
seemed to lunge abreast of Kirksey and,
with the last ten yards, gain a scant ten
inch advantage as he broke the tape. If
Paddock ran 9:3 yesterday, Kirksey
surely traveled the distance in less than
9:4-
Paddock won the furlong with five
yards to spare, as Kirksey slowed down
after the two hundred yard mark. For
the first hundred and fifty the men raced
with scarcely any advantage $ either.
Stanford won the meet itself by the
score of 75 to 56. U. S. C. did not enter
men in the high jump or the two mile,
so the Cardinals made a clean sweep in
both events.
Aside from the .sprints, the hest race
of tile day was the quarter, which was
taken by George Schiller of the Trojans
in the fast time of 50:2-5 seconds.
Kenny Wright finished less than three
yards behind, with Bob Wright at his
heels.
Art Wilcox won the pole vault at
twelve feet and after clearing five inches
higher on his second trial called it a
good day's work Green's work yester
day in the same event showed that lie is
getting into good shape again. Norris
of the Bruins should have a hard time
touching either one of these men in the
"big meet."
