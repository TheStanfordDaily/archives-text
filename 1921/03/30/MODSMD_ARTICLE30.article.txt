for Tuesday and Thursday afternoon
at 4 :35.
The events in the meet will include
I>lain and fancy diving, the plunge for
distance, and the 25, 50 and 100 yard
dashes.
Practice has been started early this
quarter in order that there may be at
least a month of training and practice
before the meet. The swimming man
ager is particularly anxious that as many
new people as possible try out for class
teams. Many of the members of the
last year's teams have already signed
for the meet.
