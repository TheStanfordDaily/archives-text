# LIEUTENANT FURLONG GIVES ILLUSTRATED ADDRESS ON TURKEY
## 
### 
Turkey is an old bird, and carving her
is likely to prove a strenuous proposi
tion. Such was the sentiment expressed
by Lieutenant Charles Wellington Fur
long in his lecture. "Turkey, the Cross
ways of the World," which he delivered
last evening at the Little Theater.
Having chosen his subject from per
sonal experiences, Lieutenant Furlong
was able to render some interesting side
lights on conditions in Turkey and to
give his audience an intiniateN glimpse
into the country of the Saracens.
At the present time Turkey is under
going a severe economic strain. She is
making a supreme struggle to prevent
the partition of her country, and to re
tain her old foothold in eastern Europe.
Her people are eager for peace. There
is a universal longing to get back to the
farms, and to preserve in harmony the
old-time strength and stability' of the
empire-
The lecturer illustrated ltis talk with
intimate views of the country in and
about Constantinople, along the Bos
phorous, and through the market streets
of Stamboul. It afforded his audience a
delightful trip through this Near East
ern empire and gave them an insight
into the country and people of Turkey,
both in war and peace. He spoke espe
cially of Robert College as the greatest
moral offensive ever launched in the Far
East. Through it more windows of
thought have been opened than by any
one other economic or educational factor
that has been recorded.
In conclusion, Lieutenant Furlong
brought home the vital import of Amer
ica's position regarding this country of
the Saracens. For the United States to
hold a mandate over all of Turkey in
Asia and Constantinople would be, in
his opinion, a feasablc solution of the
present problem. It must, however, in
clude the absolute withdrawal of con
trol by all other nations, Russia among
them; and further, the United States
herself should be in a position to with
draw if at any time she so desired.
