## 
### 
The Glee Club returned home yes
i terday morning after a successful ten
days' tour of Southern California. In
all, they gave eighteen concerts while
:in the South and appeared before
large and enthusiastic audiences, both
I public, high school assemblies and
alumni groups.
Thirty-three men made the trip in
cluding J. E. McDowell, the alumni
secretary, and W. I). Allen, the choral
director. Their most important con
certs were presented at Graumont's
million-dollar theater in Los Angeles;
the Ambassador Hotel in the same
city; the Municipal Auditorium at
Long Beach; and the Rubido sunrise
ceremony at Riverside. Individuals
who heard the club's work had nothing
but the highest praise for the enter
tainment they offered, and they were
rewarded with attractive press notices
in all the musical reviews of the
southland.
. On the trip, they sang in several of
the largest high schools in the state
fcind gave important programs before
a number of alumni groups with high
school athletes as their guests. The
alumni in Riverside and Santa Ana
entertained the Glee Club with sump
tuous banquets followed by dancing.
The 'old-timers' who arranged the pro
grams were Sam Halstead, '15 and
Herbert West, '95, in Riverside; and
Estelle Nisson, '19, in Santa Ana.
So ( great was their welcome in Los
Angeles that it is said to have been
the first time in months that Grau
man's Theater had been filled to ca
pacity at a Sunday morning concert.
All their offerings on the Southern
trip were of a new and modern type,
with strictly classical choral work.
Vaudeville variations were put on by
L. Seib, '22, J. Hefferman, '22, and by
Nelson Valjean, '24.
Richard Malaby was the piano solo
,ist for the club and Phillip Richards
was the vocal soloist. The final con
cert was given last night at the Ho
tel Ambassador at Santa Barbara.
Immediately afterwards the men were
guests of the hotel at a dinner and
dance.
Next Friday night, the Glee Club
will sing at the Base Hospital, as a
benefit for the nurses there. On April
9, they will appear at. San Mateo un
der the auspices of the local Amer
ican Legion post. Other trips planned
for later in the season include, Del
