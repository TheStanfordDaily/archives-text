"California and the Japanese," is
the title of an article appearing in the
April number of the Atlantic Monthly
written by Prof. Payson J. Treat, of
the History department, in which he
discusses this question from a new
standpoint. Prof. Treat is of the
opinion that the Japanese agitation is
in line with the earlier movement
against the Chinese and that the pres
ent situation is made possible by the
unrestricted immigration of Japanese
up to 1908.
The remedy, according to the
is not in drastic measures, but lies
in restricted immigration which will
make the Japanese race a smaller
part of the population here and thus
cause it to be a more negligible factor.
The problem, Professor Treat con
tends, will in this manner practically
solve itself.
