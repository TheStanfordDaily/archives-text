series tho Freshmen are the* only ones
that have completed their matches.
Ruth Lee Spillman won from Sidney
Hawkins 6 2, 0-3, in the Imal round of
the Freshman series. Owing to the fact
that Rujth Spillman will not return to

in line, will represent the Freshman class
in the singles and Dorothy Fhrhorn will
probably play with Grace Strobel in the
doubles in the interclass intercollegiate.
