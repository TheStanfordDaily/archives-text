# RUSHING FOR WOMEN WILL REMAIN FORMAL
## 
### 
Informal rushing will not replace tlie
regular formal season, according to the
decision made at a special meeting of
Pnnhcllenic Association held yesterday
afternoon. The change to an informal
season was suggested because of the
small number of women entering the
University this quarter, but it was the
opinion of the majority of Panhcllcnic
members that a formal schedule is pref
erable.
Rushing will begin with teas at the
various sororities on Saturday and will
continue for ten days with luncheon and
dinner dates. Both fraternity women
and Freshmen arc urged to closely ob
serve the rules which are published in
the rushing contract for this quarter.
