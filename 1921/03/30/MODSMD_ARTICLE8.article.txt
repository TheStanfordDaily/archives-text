V)
M. L. McClintock this morning. The
medal will be awarded to the judges'
choice on the following night after the

and the Treaty of Versailles."
Baron de Coubertin, a French au
thority on American affairs, during his
travels in the United States estab

American college circles in 189C.
Stanford and California were chosen
as representative western colleges, a
second award was established in New

Baron de Coubertin's sole stipulation
in establishing the award was that
contestants confine their discussion to

California has won the majority of
the medals awarded in thle past
twenty-five , years, J. E. Driscoll, '18,
