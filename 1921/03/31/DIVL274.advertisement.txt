WEEK-END SPECIAL
FRIDAY SATURDAY SUNDAY
A DELICIOUS TREAT
This weeks' offer includes Caramels and Peanut Candy.
TWO UNIVERSAL FAVORITES
ABOUT THE CARAMELS
nearly everybody likes caramels, and everyone who does,
knows a good caramel at the first taste. These are the
full-cream rieh-in-butter kind, in assorted flavors —some
plain, some with marslimallow, and some with nuts. They
are good samples of WILSON quality.
ABOUT THE PEANUT CANDY
We make several kinds —commonly known as "Brittle,"
"Taffy," "Crisp," etc. You'll like every kind, and will find
it difficult to decide which is the best. Like our other
nut candies, our peanut candy is "chock full of nuts."
