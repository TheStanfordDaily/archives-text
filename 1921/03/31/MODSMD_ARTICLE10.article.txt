# Eddie Sudden Will Lead Freshman Track Squad in Meet with Cubs Saturday
## 
### 
Eddie Sudden, sprinter, will lead the
Freshman track team against the Cali
fornia yearlings at Berkeley day after
tomorrow. He was elected captain at a
meeting of the members of the 1924
squad at the Union last night. Sudden,
one of the most promising dash men
Stanford has had for several years, won
both the 100 and the 220 events in the
California Interscholastic meet last year,
and should have little trouble in break
ing the tape in both races against the
Bruin Freshmen. Sudden is pledged to
Zeta Psi and registers from San Fran
cisco.
With both Ralph Shermund, quarter
miler, and Richards, discus thrower, un
able to register here this quarter, Coach
"Dink" Templeton's 1924 aggregation
will meet California as badly crippled as
when scholarship records were an
nounced the last of vacation week.
Varsity Takes It Easy
The Varsity squad took it easy yes

terday and will taper down on the hard
work the rest of this week. The Po
mona College Varsity will arrive here
Saturday for a contest with Templeton's
men. While the meet should be an easy
affair for the Card tracksters, keen com
petition will be offered by the southern
ers in several events.
Daggs, a hurdler with marks of 15:2
and 24:3 in the high and low sticks, re
spectively, should offer Bob Williams
and Lane Falk plenty of trouble. Jess
Wells will not compete as he is in poor
shape. Moreman, the southern distance
star, has marks of 4:30 in the mile and
2:00 flat in the half. The other stars of
the Pomona team are Captain Widdess,
who hurls the discus close to 140 feet,
and Voorhies in the high jump, with a
record of 6 feet.
Captain Kirksey will probably only
run one race Saturday as he slightly in
jured a muscle in his leg in the 220 race
with Paddock Tuesday.
