# OAKLAND PREPS ARE SWAMPED BY FROSH IN CLOSING INNINGS
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the Frosh nine
obscured the Oakland High School un
der an eight point margin, holding them
to four runs. The game was marked
by the costly errors, which in numbers
and disaster treated the prep team
worst, and the Frosh rally in the last
two innings when in both frames they
batted one less than the rounds.
Frye, who pitches with his off hand,
handled the entire game with Fuller.
Fuller is one of the fortunates who have
distinction thrust upon them, for he
played field until the scarcity of catchers
brought out his ability. He caught a
good game, with but one error, and
poled two in the right places.
Frye used the first two innings to get
warmed up in and, incidentally, by let
ting three men travel the circuit as the
result of a brace of hits and walks, gave
the Babes something to work for. The
small attack in the third tied the score
for the Frosh and the battle lulled for
two innings.
The sixth inning netted another run
for the visitors and began for the Frosh
in the shadow of a whiff. Colvin, bat
ting for Cole, who had hurt his ankle
sliding to second, started the parade
with a clean single off the new pitcher.
The next event was a one-base gallop
by Sniurr on the error of the Oakland
third baseman. The pitcher next ob
ligingly muffed Chandler's contribution
and Colvin came home in a flurry of
dirt. Fuller's single brought Smurr and
Chandler in, and lie in turn did the
pigeon act on a double by Frye.
Things were post|>oned here till the
formality of retiring three more in
vaders was attended to, and the party
was then resumed. A base on-balls, two
singles and an error which was stretched
to a double all slipped in before the
pitcher negotiated his strike-out. Fuller
and Frye then placed once more and
Bud Woodward connected. After al
most the whole team had had a chance
to use poor judgment, which they did,
the dust settled with Bud on the third
sack. The catcher caught him, though,
and the score had to remain 12-4. as it
was not necessary for the Frosh to use
the stick again.
