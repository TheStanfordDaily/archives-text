# ST. MARY'S WINS FROM VARSITY IN LOOSE GAME, 7-5
## Coach Seay Uses Makeshift Lineup Against Oaklanders and Visitors Romp Away 
### 
Coach Seay had to use a makeshift
lineup against the St. Mary's Phoenix
nine yesterday afternoon and as a con
sequence the visitors romped away with
the long end of a 7 to 5 score. The
Oaklanders displayed considerable base
ball class at times, but there is every
reason to believe that the Cardinal
Varsity colild hand them an artistic
trimming with a regular lineup on the
field.
Emery Mitchell, who has been rough
ing up the opposing pitchers in most of
the preliminary games, was forced to
lay of! yesterday because of illness and
"Red" Maillot went in at second base.
"Red" played nice ball at times and gar
nered an opportune bingle in the seventh
inning rally, but he lacks the experience
and punch that Mitchell has.
George Green started pitching for
Stanford and allowed the Catholic ag
gregation two hits in three innings. He
was taken out at the end of the third
inning so that he can work against the
Blue and Gold team on Saturday.
Kelly replaced Green in the fourth
frame and after an inning during which
he received heart-breaking support from
the infield he blew up and seven runs
were scored off him, two coming in the
fourth, three in the fifth and two more
in the sixth. The first two runs were
due to infield errors, but the three in the
fifth were scored following three honest
to-George base knocks. The final two
runs were made when Kelly walked two
batters and the third man up rapped a
single to deep left, scoring both runners.
Kallam scored the first Stanford run
in the first inning. He received a free
pass to first base and scored when
Fleish, Saint third baseman, threw the
ball away trying to stop him at third'*
base, whence he was bound when Carver
was retired at first.
Seay's men were plainly baffled by the
hurling of Schnell until the seventh
spasm, when with two out they staged a
rally that came within two runs of tying
