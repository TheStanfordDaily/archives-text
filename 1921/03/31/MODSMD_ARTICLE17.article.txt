# SHAW'S "PYGMALION"; LIGHT SATIRE TO BE GIVEN HERE SOON
## 
### 
The satirical comedy which the
Berkeley Greek Theater Players will
give here April ninth, has
enormously popular elsewhere. Tho
title "Pygmalion" sounds rather class
ical and awe-inspiring but in reality
it is a light and dashing comedy, deal
ing with the influence of environment
on natural characteristics. The title
is derived from the name of the hero,
Pygmalion ;a professor of
phonetics. Having a natural taste
for experimentation he takes a girl
from the streets of London into the
cultured atmosphere of his own home
and wagers that he can make a polish
ed lady of her within a specified time.
The theme is daring and the dialogue
is sparkling with the amazing wit
which has made Shaw a great modern
comic dramatist. The entire play is
brilliant and clever and has always
been popular whenever produced.
"Pygmalion" was played by Mrs.
Patrick Campbell for several months
during the Panama-Pacific Exposition
in San Francisco. She crowded the
Columbia Theatre and brought out all
possibilities of the part of Liza, the
girl of the streets. This part is to
be played in the forthcoming produc
tion by Mrs. Irving Pischel, a very
able actiess, well-known to Berkeley
and San Francisco audiences.
