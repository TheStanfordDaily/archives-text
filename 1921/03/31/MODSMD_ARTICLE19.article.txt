# DESERVING MEN AND THE STADIUM
## 
### 
A novel opportunity lo take a part in the building of Stanford
scholarships and athletics with the same contribution of money is offered
alumni and friends of the University in the privilege of designating
to what purpose any sum advanced to the stadium must be used after
ihe stadium by its own income has paid for itself.
The Board of Control suggests that contributors whose funds make
possible the erection of the bowl may direct that the amount advanced by
them be later set aside in a fund for scholarships for Stanford students.
If an appreciable number of contributors wish their money to be used
later in the scholarship funds, the amount of the income from the stadium
which may be used directly for athletics may be diminished for a short
period. Of course it is possible that friends and alumni may designate
that their money be used for initial construction of the bowl, and then
to revert, not to scholarships, but to the Board of Athletic Control for
athletic purposes only. Yet there may be some question as to whether
the right sort of scholarship fund may not benefit the University as
much as money used directly in athletic equipment.
liases of scholarships must be fixed by the University, Yet contrib
utors may ask that their money used in stadium construction revert to a
scholarship fund that will provide annuities for Stanford students, not on
a basis of high scholarship alone, but on a fixed satisfactory scholarship
requirement in university work coupled with a definite financial need. A
student who has actually earned his way through a year of college is
not like to have an "A" average. Candidates should of course have
proved themselves of Stanford University mental caliber, but an "A"
average is not necessary to this requirement. Students who work five
hours a day in a down-town shop, for example, are practically cut off
from the possibility of an "A" or even a "l'>" average in professional
courses. More than likely they will have a number of "C's" and possibly
a few "D's." Financial aid would alTow such a student to devote more
time to getting a better average grade, and at the same time enable him
to participate iti University activities. Such scholarships will aid mate
rially in bettering the average of students graduated fit Stanford.
Awarding of scholarships to men who have not yet entered the Uni
versity could hardly be fixed on the same basis.
But whatever the method of awarding annuities to needy men, the
possibility of advancing two purposes with one effort should be pointed
out to alumni and friends of Stanford, that they are able to promote the
building of a stadium, and in addition influence some University pur
pose in the way they believe best for Stanford.

WHAT'S IN A VIEWPOINT? Charley Paddock regretted that lie
had to run the sprints at the University of California last Saturday
because in so doing he missed a debate in which he was to have taken
part. The young fellow is a debater, scholar, and editor, and takes him
self quite as seriously in these activities as in racing down the track.

WHAT'S IN A VIEWPOINT? Charley Paddock regretted that lie
had to run the sprints at the University of California last Saturday
because in so doing he missed a debate in which he was to have taken
part. The young fellow is a debater, scholar, and editor, and takes him
self quite as seriously in these activities as in racing down the track.
A novel opportunity lo take a part in the building of Stanford
scholarships and athletics with the same contribution of money is offered
alumni and friends of the University in the privilege of designating
to what purpose any sum advanced to the stadium must be used after
ihe stadium by its own income has paid for itself.
The Board of Control suggests that contributors whose funds make
possible the erection of the bowl may direct that the amount advanced by
them be later set aside in a fund for scholarships for Stanford students.
If an appreciable number of contributors wish their money to be used
later in the scholarship funds, the amount of the income from the stadium
which may be used directly for athletics may be diminished for a short
period. Of course it is possible that friends and alumni may designate
that their money be used for initial construction of the bowl, and then
to revert, not to scholarships, but to the Board of Athletic Control for
athletic purposes only. Yet there may be some question as to whether
the right sort of scholarship fund may not benefit the University as
much as money used directly in athletic equipment.
liases of scholarships must be fixed by the University, Yet contrib
utors may ask that their money used in stadium construction revert to a
scholarship fund that will provide annuities for Stanford students, not on
a basis of high scholarship alone, but on a fixed satisfactory scholarship
requirement in university work coupled with a definite financial need. A
student who has actually earned his way through a year of college is
not like to have an "A" average. Candidates should of course have
proved themselves of Stanford University mental caliber, but an "A"
average is not necessary to this requirement. Students who work five
hours a day in a down-town shop, for example, are practically cut off
from the possibility of an "A" or even a "l'>" average in professional
courses. More than likely they will have a number of "C's" and possibly
a few "D's." Financial aid would alTow such a student to devote more
time to getting a better average grade, and at the same time enable him
to participate iti University activities. Such scholarships will aid mate
rially in bettering the average of students graduated fit Stanford.
Awarding of scholarships to men who have not yet entered the Uni
versity could hardly be fixed on the same basis.
But whatever the method of awarding annuities to needy men, the
possibility of advancing two purposes with one effort should be pointed
out to alumni and friends of Stanford, that they are able to promote the
building of a stadium, and in addition influence some University pur
pose in the way they believe best for Stanford.
