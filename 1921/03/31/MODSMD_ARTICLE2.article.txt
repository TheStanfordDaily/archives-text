# CARNIVAL SONGS MUST BE HANDED IN BY APRIL 4—SURE
## 
### 
Tbe date limit for submitting the
Carnival songs has been advanced to
Monday, April 4. Concessions Direc
tor Dan W. Evans, '20, has made this
extension to a'low for the confusion
incident to the registration week.
Monday the songs must be in his
hands, however, because that is the
latest date that they can be taken to
San Francisco for printing.
This afternoon the representatives
from the groups met to hear the final
instructions relative to the conces
sions that each is going to have. The
«ystem of lights as arranged by Stark
Draper, '21, head electrician, and
Earnest Creppin, '24, as assistant,
was explained. A system of lighting
will be used whereby every concession
wiJl have a lighting arrangement that
is different from any other and yet
all will carry out the general plan of
the Spanish ideas.
