fOREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, CORVALLIS, March 30. â€” A
great forensic organization for O. A. C.
is now in the process of formation and
bids fair to bring about real results, ac
cording to all reports. Five bodies are
federated into one central group
by the proposed plan. The plan is being
fostered by Professor C. B. Mitchell,
head of public speaking, and Donald
Morse, forensic manager. Mask and
Dagger Dramatic Society, Shakopean
Literary Society, Men's Varsity Forensic
Association, the Women's Industrial
Club, and Zeta Kappa, women's honor
ary debate fraternity, will be represented
in the federation. The name is to be
the O. A. C. Forensic Association.
By organizing public speaking, debate,
oratory, dramatics andresearch work
on the campus into one federation these
men intend to put mental athletics on a
plane with those of the physical world.
The "gift of gab," the ability to con
vince, and the power to portray charac
ter are to be given a real boost if the
organization carrics out all of its plans.
