# GYMNASIUM GROWS UNDER HELEN MASTERS BUNTING
## 
### 
Perhaps the best known of all the
faculty members to the women of the
University is Helen Masters Bunting,
head of the Women's Physical Educa
tion Department. Every woman has
met her "officially" in her office at
some time or another, and those who
are connected with women's sports
iin any way have met her "unofficially"
and on the athletic lields and know
her to be the main factor in the rapid
growth of women's athletics during the
last two years.
After having completed preparatory
work at the Friend Select School in
Boston, Miss Bunting taught at the
Baldwin School at Bryn Mawr, before
continuing her work at Wellesley from
where she received her A. B. In the
Department of Hygiene, in 1912. For
the next two years she was physical
education director at the Centenary
Collegiate Institute in Hacketstown,
New Jersey.
In 1914 she accepted the position
of director of the women's Physical
Education department at the Universi
ty of Colorado, in Boulder, Colorado.
Here she practically installed a new
department, making physical educa
tion for women a requirement and had
the work in the department granted

academic credit. She also added a
medical advisor and another instructor
to the departmental staff. Under her
supervision many new phases of ath
letic activities were added to the curri
culum and women's athletic fields
•were added to the campus so that for
the first time in the history of the
institution women took part in outdoor
sports.
In the fall of 1919 she resigned to
accept the position as head of the
women's Physical Education depart
ment at Stanford. Here she was given
free reign and organized the activities
on the seasonal basis, laying particu
lar emphasis on the outdoor activities
in the autumn and spring quarters
and confining thtf formal gymnastic
work to the winter.
Many new activities were added to
the curriculum of the department so
that it now includes hockey, basket
ball, baseball, tennis, archery, fencing,
gymnastics, dancing, equitation, swim
ming and diving.
In discussing the growing popularity
of the department, Miss Bunting said:
"Success and popularity of the swim
ming and diving is due entirely to the
excellent teaching and inspiring per
sonality of Mrs. Brandsten. The equi
tation is possible through the co
operation of the military department
and the personal generosity of Major
Collins who has given so freely of his
I time. Such other successes as the
department may have obtained are
due to the hearty co-operation of all
of the members of the Roble Gyra
j nasium staff."
I "The ideals of the department center
j around the furthering of the best in
i terests and health of the women stu
| dents, fostering a spirit of democracy
| rind solidarity training them in the
! highest type of sportsmanship and for
j the department to do its part is pend
j ing Stanford women into a life hf ef
j ficient service."
j Realizing the utter inadequiieness
I of the equipment in the old Robl-J Gym
-1 nasium which was built the
j early years of the university and of
| the old athletic fields she Jtias been
I instrumental in bringing about the in
| stallation of the new athletic fields,
j which are expected to be completed
j by thti summer quarter and which she
helped to plan. These nev fields will
: be 300 by 200 feet in size and will be
j arranged according to Reason with
i movable standards for each sport.
Besides being head of the Physical
I Education department she is chairman
j of the Faculty Committee on Women's
| Athletics, which helps to point out the
j policies to be adopted in women's ath
i letics, and she is an honorary member
' of the Women's Athletic Association.
She is president of the Amy Morris
Women's Club of Central California
and a member of the Hygiene Gradu
ates of Wellesley in this vicinity.
The most ardent hope entertained
by Miss Bunting now is that in the
next two or three years a new and
adequate gymnasium will be added
which will help the department ma
terially in carrying out its ideals and
the desires of thp founders of the
university as expressed in the words
of Mrs. Stanford, /The university was
accordingly designed for the better
ment of mankind/ morally, spiritually,
intellectually, physically, and materi
ally."

institution women took part in outdoor
sports.
In the fall of 1919 she resigned to
accept the position as head of the
women's Physical Education depart

free reign and organized the activities
on the seasonal basis, laying particu
lar emphasis on the outdoor activities
in the autumn and spring quarters

work to the winter.
Many new activities were added to
the curriculum of the department so
that it now includes hockey, basket

gymnastics, dancing, equitation, swim

In discussing the growing popularity
of the department, Miss Bunting said:
"Success and popularity of the swim
ming and diving is due entirely to the
excellent teaching and inspiring per
sonality of Mrs. Brandsten. The equi

operation of the military department
and the personal generosity of Major
Collins who has given so freely of his

Perhaps the best known of all the
faculty members to the women of the
University is Helen Masters Bunting,
head of the Women's Physical Educa
tion Department. Every woman has
met her "officially" in her office at
some time or another, and those who
are connected with women's sports
iin any way have met her "unofficially"
and on the athletic lields and know
her to be the main factor in the rapid
growth of women's athletics during the
last two years.
After having completed preparatory
work at the Friend Select School in
Boston, Miss Bunting taught at the
Baldwin School at Bryn Mawr, before
continuing her work at Wellesley from
where she received her A. B. In the
Department of Hygiene, in 1912. For
the next two years she was physical
education director at the Centenary
Collegiate Institute in Hacketstown,
New Jersey.
In 1914 she accepted the position
of director of the women's Physical
Education department at the Universi
ty of Colorado, in Boulder, Colorado.
Here she practically installed a new
department, making physical educa
tion for women a requirement and had
the work in the department granted

academic credit. She also added a
medical advisor and another instructor
to the departmental staff. Under her
supervision many new phases of ath
letic activities were added to the curri
