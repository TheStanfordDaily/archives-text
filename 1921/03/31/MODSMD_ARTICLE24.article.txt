A three-quarter scholar,
What makes you flunk so soon?
They let the freshmen leave in March
Who use to mail till June.
For a class yell:
Ex axe ex-'24,
Ex axe ex-'24,
WE got the axe, Rah!
For the next Frosh poster:
Beware the Ides of March!
For their song:
S—Stands for Stanford scholars,
T—For the team shot to—
A—For the axe,
N—For its knacks,
Hope of the Gold and Blue,
La-La-La.
F—Means we always flunk flat.
O—For the hours drawn,
R—For resolve that's gone,
D—How we always die,
Stanford, for you.
Well, at that, the track frosh are
surely flunking out in 2-4 time. March
time, as it were.

Who use to mail till June.
For a class yell:
Ex axe ex-'24,
Ex axe ex-'24,
WE got the axe, Rah!
For the next Frosh poster:
Beware the Ides of March!
For their song:
S—Stands for Stanford scholars,
T—For the team shot to—
A—For the axe,
N—For its knacks,
Hope of the Gold and Blue,
La-La-La.
F—Means we always flunk flat.
O—For the hours drawn,
R—For resolve that's gone,
D—How we always die,
Stanford, for you.
Well, at that, the track frosh are
surely flunking out in 2-4 time. March
time, as it were.
