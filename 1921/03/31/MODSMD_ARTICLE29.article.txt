# PRINCETON FACULTY APPROVES PLAN OF STUDENT DISCIPLINE
## 
### 
PRINCETON, March 31.—Princeton
University this week took a long step
toward complete student control of the
morals of the undergraduate- when the
Faculty unanimously approved a resolu
tion giving to the Senior Council, the
student governing body selected by the
undergraduates, power of dismissal from
the university without a statement of
cause to the Discipline Committee or
any other body connected with the
Faculty. The Princeton Senior Council
under this ruling will have power to
deal unmolested and without reporting
any evidence with any cases which in
their estimation "tend to lower the
moral tone and good name of Prince
ton."
President Hibben today issued a state
ment commending the new plan.
The resolution adopted by the Faculty
on the subject requires a three-quarters
majority of the Council vote to convict
a student.
That the erring undergraduate will
find no easy jury to face him when he
is brought to trial by the fifteen mem
bers of the Council is to be seen from
the severe nature of the penalties which
are always inflicted by the undergrad
uates. Dean McClenahan, in comnjent
ing «m the new rule, said:
"Their attitude toward their fellow
students is exactly what one would ex
pect. They are, on the whole, more
severe in their judgments than are the
members of the Faculty, and are even
more bloodthirsty than 1."
This drastic action is the result of the
gradual development of the Princeton
honor system, established twenty-eight
years ago. Under this system all ex
aminations are conducted without Fac
ulty supervision, and the student is at
liberty to talk with others during the
examination, or even to leave the ex
amination hall for a smoke or to get
the morning mail at his room, the only
restriction being a signed pledge of
honesty at the end of the paper. A
student committee deals with all sus
pected cases of cheating, and Dean Mc-
Clenahan, the chief disciplinarian of the
university, recently stated that in the
entire twenty-eight years "the number
of proven cases of dishonesty might
almost be counted on the fingers of two
hands." In the same statement, the
Dean, who was an undergraduate at the
time of the inception of' the honor sys
tem, dubbed cribbing as "one of
Princeton's favorite indoor sports "prior
to this time."
