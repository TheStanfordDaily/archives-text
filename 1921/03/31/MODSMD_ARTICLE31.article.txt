# SPRING FEVER DOPE
## 
### "Ed 
The Pomona College team, which
meets the Varsity here Saturday in
competing with the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley this afternoon.
Gene Davis, varsity hurdler and
broad jumper last year, is back on the
campus after eight months spent in
the Malay Peninsula. Davis, in com
pany with several other Stanford men,
was working in the tin mines there.
Bowers, the husky freshman weight
man, who is one of the many athletes
from the 1924 squad lost by scholar
ship deficiency, went out for a little
exercise the other morning and pro
ceeded to toss the shot 48 feet 1 inch.
In six consecutive trials, Bowers
heaved the 16-pound aflair over 46
feet.
Ken Nef, one of Duffy Seay's hurl
ers, may be the man of the hour.
Sent in as a relief pitcher yesterday,
Nef allowed one hit in three rounds
and on top of that connected with a
timely bingle that drove in a flock of
runs. With Draper out of Saturday's
fracas with California and Green pack
ing a sore arm, Nef may be called
upon to go part of tha route.
"Swede" Righter, freshman baseball
mentor, has had his troubles with
players being declared ineligible as
well as "Dink" Templeton. No less
'than seven of the 1924 ball squad
were forced to turn in their suits.
Coach Templeton will pick a list of
men within a few days who will com
plete the training table at the Break
ers' Club
