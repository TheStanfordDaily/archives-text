# GEORGE GREEN WILL OPEN GAME SATURDAY WITH BERKELEY NINE
## 
### 
Gecrge Green will oppose the Cali
fornia Varsity when that team comes to
Stanford Saturday for the first game of
the annual series. Green worked three
innings against the fast St. Mary's Col
lege team yesterday afternoon and got
away in fine shape. The Collegians
made but two scratchy bingles off his
delivery in the three innings he was on
the mound. Guy Draper, who has been
having trouble with a sore hand, will
not t>e in shape for the opening game,
so Green will probably work the full
distance.
Coach Seay will send his strongest
lineup against the Bears in an effort to
get the edge on the series by taking the
first game. Captain Bundy will be be
hind the log, with Patterson on first
base, Mitchell at second, Kallam at short
and "Lefty" Heckendorf on third base.
The outfield will probably be composed
of Kline, left field, Carver, center field,
and Crowe, right field.
Not a great deal is known of the
strength of the California aggregation.
The Bruins got off to a bad start at the
beginning of the season, but their record
in the last few games has been strictly
on the up. Neither Stanford nor Cali
fornia looked too good against the
Coast League clubs. Stanford lost one
game to San Francisco 23 to 2 and an
other 7 to 2, while Zamlock's outfit
dropped a game to the Oakland club 21
to 4. If anything, these games would
indicate that Stanford has an edge on
the transbay club, because San Francisco
is figured to have a much stronger team
than their Oakland neighbors.
Captain "Moke" Meyers seems to be
the bad man of the Berkeley team. He
has been hitting them far and often in
the games played by his team. Hermle,
the Makin brothers, Toomey and O'Neill
are also good baseball players and arc
not unknown to the Stanford baseball
supporters.
O'Neill is the choice for mound duty
Saturday. He is regarded as one of the
craftiest heavers in college baseball, and
he never misses an opportunity to sneak
something over on an unwary batsman.
The game is scheduled to lxgin at 3
o'clock, immediately following the track
meet between Stanford and Pomona.
The admission price will be 35 cents to
study body card holders and 75 cents to
outsiders.
Burnside, formerly an umpire in the
Western League, will wear the wind pad
and manipulate the indicator.
