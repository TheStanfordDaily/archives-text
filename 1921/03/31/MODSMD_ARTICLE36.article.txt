### 
Naturally, those who see this head
ing expect to read about some "baby
heir" of an American multi-millionaire,
end they will be surprised to learn
that such a description applies to
a scientific pyorrhea preventive, tooth
and mouth preparation; and they will
doubtless wonder how suÂ«h a product
ever came to be spoken of as a "mil
lion-dollar baby." So the story must
be told. Over three years ago, the
Research Department of the Rexall
Company, in consultation with chem
ical specialists, began an exhaustive
investigation into the disease Pyor
rhea, and its proper treatment, and
in their characteristically thorough
way spent over two years before they
perfected a compound which answered
every test according to their high
standards. Such a remarkable de
mand has been created that they have
named it "the Million Dollar Baby."
Probably no preparation that is de
vised lor use as a germ combater
was found so efficacious in preventing
all contagious diseases that enter the
system through the mouth and nose
as Klenzo Liquid Antiseptic. Kspeci
ally was it proved that users of it
completely escaped all attacks of the
"flu" when so prevalent last year.
This Rexall product can, be purchased
in 25c and 50c special toilet bottles at
