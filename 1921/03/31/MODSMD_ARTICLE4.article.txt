# Peninsula Highway Speed Wagon Kings Get K.O. from State
## 
### 
Let all ye campus travelers who jour
ney off to the nearby metropolis of the
Golden Gate on each and every week
end, by means of the many and varied
80-called "rapid transit" contrivances
which make the trip, sit up and take no
tice. And especially let all the speed
thirsty demons of tliat number particu
larly lament, for speed will no longer
be the first consideration of the buss
companies operating between here and
San Francisco.
For the warning has gone forth from
no less a personage than the president
of the State Railroad Commission that
the "68-cent contraptions" are leading
too fast a life for the rest of the uni
verse and must settle down! D:irk tales
have reached the president's ears of
wide-open throttles and gasping motors,
as the huge contrivances rolled over the
highway at 60 per, through neighboring
"cities," defying the honest efforts of
the conscientious town marshals to stop
the practice and scaring the livestock
en route into delirium tremens! His
edict then, has been, "SLOW DOWN!"
The only alternative his honof offers to
the above proposal is the horny hand of
the law. In substance, his remarks
upon the subject were about as follows:
"If there is any question of maintain
ing time schedules or of maintaining
law, automobile stage companies of the
state of California must place the kiw
foremost."
Thus the law has spoken, and campus
speed fiends will have to seek some other
way to hit the road at the sixty per
which the busses did formerly.
