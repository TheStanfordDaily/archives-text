# FINAL QUESTION CHOSEN FOR THE JOFFRE DEBATE
## Professor F. A. Ogg, of Wisconsin, Sends Sealed Topic to President R. L. Wilbur 
### 
The final question for the Joffre
debate to be held in the Assembly Hall
next Saturday night, between Stan
ford and California speakers has been
chosen by Professor Frederick A.
Ogg of the University of Wisconsin.
Professor Ogg, who is a well-known
American authority on French affairs
has sent the sealed question to Presi
dent Wilbur, who will keep it in his
office until Saturday night, two hours
before the debate. The discussion will
be presided over by Professor E. A.
Cottrell, of the Department of Political
Science.
Vernon Green, '21, L. B. Martin, '22,
and Wylie Kilpatrick, '23, will repre
sent the Cardinal in the extemporane
ous discussion with A. E. Murphy,
Clifton Hildebrand and Miss Grace
Dietz of the Blue and Gold forensic
squad. The local trio has been work
ing on the general question, "France
and the Treaty of Versailles," for the
past week and during the spring va
cation. Coach M. L. McClintock has
expressed himself as well-satisfied
with the work of the squad but pre
dicts a close contest. Hildebrand was
an especially strong speaker last year,
Murphy showed himself to be an ef
fective debater while he was at Stan
ford. and Miss Dietz has an enviable
reputation in intersociety forensic
circles at California. Although all
three of the Stanford men are well
prepared for the contest, the decision
remains very much in doubt. The
nature of the question chosen for the
final discussion will probably play a
large part in throwing the balance one
way or another.
Ownership of the Joffre medal is one
of the most highly coveted forensic
honors west of the Mississippi river
and has always attracted wide atten
tion in the past. No other discussion
of the Joffre's exact nature has been
instituted as an annual event between
colleges in the West although a Joffre
medal is offered to university debaters
in New Orleans and Pennsylvania.
The trophy is not only a valued
honor but contains $100 in gold. A
twenty-four carat medal has been
awarded to a Stanford or California
speaker since the founding of the
award by Baron de Coubertin, in 1896.
Tho debate will be held in the As
sembly Hall at 8 o'clock, Saturday
night.
