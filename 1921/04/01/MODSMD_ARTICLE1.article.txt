# JOFFRE DEBATE HOLDS INTEREST HERE TOMORROW
## Green, Martin and Kilpatrick to Represent Cardinal in Annual Extempore Clash 
### 
Six speakers representing Stanford
and California will clash tomorrow night
in the Assembly Hall in the annual ex
temporaneous discussion for the owner
ship of the Joffre medal presented to the
most effective speaker by the French
republic.
Vernon Green, '21, L. ii. Martin, '22,
and Wylie Kilpatrick, '23, comprise the
Cardinal trio who will participate in the
annual contest together with Clifton
Hildebrand, A. E. Murphy and Miss
Grace Deitz of California.
The general question on which the
speakers have been working is "France
and the Treaty of Versailles." Tomor
row evening at 6 o'clock, two hours be
fore the first speaker appears on the
lloor, a specific question chosen by Pro
fessor Frederick A. Ogg of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, will be read to the
participants. They will then decide or
der of speech and side by either prefer
ence or lot. After the question has been
read and order of appearance made
clear, the speakers will retire to separate
rooms in the English building, where,
with the aid of only such material as
they brought with them, they will pre
pare their main speeches. No speaker
will be allowed to discuss the topic
before the debate, after the sealed ques
tion has been opened.
Promptly at 8 o'clock the first speaker
will appear on the platform to open the
discussion for the affirmative. In order
to remove the handicap of an introduc
tory speech, necessary from the first
affirmative debater, the order of refuta
tion will be altered to allow the first
speaker to appear last. This innovation
follows from investigation brought about
by the failure of first affirmative speak
ers to convince a Joffre debate judge of
the effectiveness of introduction.

versity of Washington at Seattle last
year m the. Pacific Coast League dis

and Wylie Kilpatrick, '23, comprise the
Cardinal trio who will participate in the
annual contest together with Clifton
Hildebrand, A. E. Murphy and Miss
Grace Deitz of California.
The general question on which the
speakers have been working is "France
and the Treaty of Versailles." Tomor
row evening at 6 o'clock, two hours be
fore the first speaker appears on the
lloor, a specific question chosen by Pro
fessor Frederick A. Ogg of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, will be read to the
participants. They will then decide or
der of speech and side by either prefer
ence or lot. After the question has been
read and order of appearance made
clear, the speakers will retire to separate
rooms in the English building, where,
with the aid of only such material as
they brought with them, they will pre
pare their main speeches. No speaker
will be allowed to discuss the topic
before the debate, after the sealed ques
tion has been opened.
Promptly at 8 o'clock the first speaker
will appear on the platform to open the
discussion for the affirmative. In order
to remove the handicap of an introduc
tory speech, necessary from the first
affirmative debater, the order of refuta
tion will be altered to allow the first
speaker to appear last. This innovation
follows from investigation brought about
by the failure of first affirmative speak
ers to convince a Joffre debate judge of
the effectiveness of introduction.
