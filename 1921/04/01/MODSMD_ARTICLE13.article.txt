# CARDINAL SPRINTERS MEET POMONA TEAM IN LAST PRELIMINARY
## 
### 
The Pomona College Varsity track
team meets the Stanford Varsity here j
tomorrow in the last preliminary meet
before the California contest on April
16. The first event will be called at
1:30 in order that the fans may have
plenty of time to see the baseball game.
Pomona yesterday suffered defeat at
Berkeley before Walter Christie's men,
but in several events the southerners
showed themselves to be strong. Daggs,
hurdler, took three first places and
Moreman, miler, defeated Captain
"Pesky" Sprott of the Bears, although
he in turn was beaten to the tape by
Mejia in the fast time of 4:26.
Daggs should find plenty of competi
tion here, however, as Bob Williams and
Lane Falk have both been climbing over
the. barrier events in speedy time. Coach
Templeton will not use Jess Wells, last
year's captain, tomorrow, as Wells has
been in poor shape for some time. Cap
tain Kirksey will in all probability only
run the 220, and Daggs will not be able
to duplicate his California victory in
this event.
Captain Widdess brings with him a
record in the discus of 140 feet. Arnold,
tl\e southerners' best sprinter, has a
mark of 10.1, but at Claremont during
spring vacation, Templeton's dash men,
Kirksey, Wells and A1 Carrey, all beat
him to the tape.
