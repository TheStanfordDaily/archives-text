# MAJOR SPORT HONORS
## 
### 
Supremacy in five major sports is decided between California and
Stanford each year. Football went to the Blue and Gold last season, and
(he Cardinal annexed basketball honors. Track, baseball, and tennis
are still to be determined, and tomorrow Duffy Seay's combination will
make its initial try for victory in the first of the three-game series 011
the diamond.
Against St. Mary's the team did not show up as well as expected in
the bleachers. But the contest did show that Seay and Captain Bundv
will be thoroughly able to send out a real baseball combination tomorrow.
With Guy Draper, veteran pitcher, in the hospital, both George Green
and Kenneth Nef showed themselves Capable of handling a squad of
good batsmen when the proper support is forthcoming from the field.
A strong team will make the trip from Berkeley tomorrow, and all
Stanfordites who delight in the old-time California Stanford competition
for major-sport honors should be table to see plenty of it from the
Cardinal bleachers tomorrow.
