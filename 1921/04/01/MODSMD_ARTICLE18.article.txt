# THE
						PLATFORM CLASSIC
## 
### 
Three California and a like number of Stanford speakers w ill wonder
tomorrow night at 6 o'clock how it happened that in two months prepara
tion they did not cover the proposition just announced for argument.
Each will then choose a side, take his armful or trunkful of books and
material to a separate room, dig in to find a few facts on the question,
find he has taken the wrong side, and finally prepare a case which lie
will present from the Assembly Hall platform at 8 o'clock.
The JofFrc debate is usually a live give-and-take argument. Cali
fornia has three good speakers,* and the Stanford trio is undeniably
a capable group of men, shifty in tactics and forceful in presentation.
The fight for the "JofFre Medaille" should be a live contest of wits.
