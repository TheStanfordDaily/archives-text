# OUR FRESHMEN TRACKSTERS
## 
### 
A freshmen track team, with half its original strength, will battle
the Bine and Gold babes at Berkeley tomorrow. While every man of
them is fighting for points in more events than any should enter, former
learn mates may be heaving the shot forty-eight feet and making paral
leled performances.
That the team is greatly weakened is no fault of the men who go
to Berkeley tomorrow. They will fight for every point in the meet,
should make a creditable showing under the circumstances, and are
worthy of the support of every Stanford man who can help them.
