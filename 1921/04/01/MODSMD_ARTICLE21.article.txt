We hope to see a goodly bunch of
Card rooters at the large small meet
at Cal. Saturday. It's worth going a
Jong way to see men perform who are
both mental and gymnastic phenoms.

Speaking of stars, the life of a few
of our local sattelites has been nothing
short of meteoric. Shooting stars
seems to be one of the chief amuse
ments of the Committee on Lack of
Scholarship.
* * *
It comes to us from good authority
that a book entitled "How to Disrupt
a Track Team Effectively" is about to
be published by distinguished scol
astic mentors.

After all. everybody's after all they
can get.

Bt'fore we forget, we feel that it
would be a public service to mention
the fact that the Frosh edition head
line that read "Winners Take Polo
Game: Losers Defeated" was clipped
ami submitted to ye. Ed as a Cabbage.
We're in doubt as to whether the con
tributor was kidding ye ed, or didn't
know what kind of a sheet the Frosh
edition was. At any rate, he failed to
give us credit for having sufficient
brains to catch the hypothetical joke.
* * *
A year ago today one of our instruc
tors played an April Fool trick on
us and cut class. We tried it our
selves today. It's a good joke on
somebody.
Asinine jokes
Phoolish tricks
Razzbecry stunts
Idiot horseplay
Lunkhead actions;
Farcial kidding and
Open house
On goofs
Lets us out.

A KICK IN MINE GOES FINE.
