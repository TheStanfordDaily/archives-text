® By M. 8., '22 <*>
Ha! We've been hearing whisper
ings of something mysterious that is
going to give the campus a surprise
in the line of theatricals. We don't
know whether it's Maud Allen or
Elhel Ilarrymore, buj\ somebody is
going to invest the campus in a week
or two and as the Dramatic Council
is not certain of the arrangements
yet, it will make no announcement till
Monday, but ye ed. has been assured
that there won't be tickets enough to
meet the demand. Well, Monday we
will know the worst.
The Junior Opera Again
Aren't'we glad? Sure, Junior Opera
tryouts begin next Tuesday, so we
co-Edwards, and co-Ednas will have
to put away the cigarette cases so the
voice will make an impression, on the
committee. He also hear hints of
dieting so the' dancing will be more
than graseful.
Varsity
The Passionate Pilgrim played at
tJio Varsity last night and is playing
again tonight. The best that can be
said for it is the setting and Ruby
deßemer.
Stanford Theater
Wanda Hawley is playing at the
Stanford in "The Snob," which is one
of her latest pictures and they say a
Stanford man wrote the story from
which it was taken.
