# T. T. C. GREGORY, '99, WRITES FOR "WORLD'S WORK" ON THE "REDS"
## 
### 
The April issue of "World's Work,"
which made its appearance on the
campus yesterday, contains the first <
of a series of articles written by T.
T. C. Gregory, a Trustee of Stanford,
and a prominent lawyer of San Fran
cisco, entitled, "Stemming the Red
Tide."
The story is preceded by a preface
written by Wilbur Hall. In it he takes
up the immensity of the task under
taken by Gregory and his ultimate suc
cess in handling it. He says thai.
Gregory served as an American Army
V'aptain during the war and at the
conclusion of hostilities was in Paris
looking for something interesting to
do. Hall mentions the fact that
Herbert Hoover and T. T. C. Gregory
were both Stanford University men
and mutual friends.
Then, one day in the streets of the
Parisian capital. Hoover came upon
Gregory and in the typical Hoover
style delivered to his former class
mate, the tremendous responsibility
of relieving the famine, and the de
struction, so prevalent in Central and
eastern Europe.
According to Hall, Hoover might
have delivered the charge in the fol
lowing way. "Gregory—Go down there
and run that show. It's going to be
a big one, and the only thing you
need to know is that you are there as
my personal representative."
And so Gregory did and the result
can best be < stated in Hall's own
words, "I am convinced that these
are the reasons why an almost un
known San Francisco lawyer succeed
ed in starting the reorganization of
Central Europe and the Balkan
States to the South-east, in unhorsing
JBela Kun, and saving a continent from
Bolshevism."
Gregory's account of the "Red"
danger menacing Central Europe and
its final defeat covers several pages,
and will be continued in a later issue.
It constitutes very interesting read,
ing, not only on account of its
historical interest, but because of the
fact that its writer was a Stanford
man.
