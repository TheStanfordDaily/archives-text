# RELATION OF STUDENT TO CHURCH IS THEME OF "DIGEST" ARTICLE
## 
### 
The Literary Digest for April 2d,
bears an article entitled, "The College
Student â€”A Churchgoer." It makes
the statement that some observers of
the situation have been alarmed at
what they thought to be an atheistic
trend among students. These facts
though are entirely disapproved as
the result of an investigation conduct
ed at the University of Chicago.
Unusual things brought out by the
census of that institution were, as fol
lows:
88 per cent of the students were
members of some religious body.
15 per cent of the wqmen were with
out affiliations, while only 9 per cent
of the men were likewise without ties.
13 per cent of the students were
engaged in some form of religious
work.
92 per cent were in the habit of at
tending church once each month.
The Digest concludes the article
with the observation that the above
is a very healthy showing and if it is
at all representative of other Amer
ican colleges, it seems to be a very
encouraging sign. It ends with the
general statement as the census indi
cates, that the college students of
today are coming from the Christian
homes of America.
