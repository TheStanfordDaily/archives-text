For Sale
One —•— — car, with a piston'ring,
Two rear wheels, one front spring.
Has no fenders, seat made of plank;
J3urns lots of gas, hard to crank;
Carburetor busted half-way through.
Engine missing—hits on two.
Only three years old, four in spring;
Has shock absorbers 'n ev'rything.
Ten spokes missing, front axle bent;
All tires punctured—not worth a cent.
Got lots o' speed, runß like the deuce;
Burns either oil or tobacco juice.
If you want this car, inquire within —
Helluva good car for the shape it's in.
Jam Jameson, 513 Encina. *
