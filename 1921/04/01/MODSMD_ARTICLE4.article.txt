# CUB DIAMONDERS OPEN BIG SERIES
## First Game With California Yearlings Is on Berkeley Field; Teams Match Well 
### 
The freshman battery against Cali
fornia tomorrow will have Bonner in
the box and Fuller behind the rubber.
This will be the first regular game
that Bonner has pitched since the Palo
Alto clash and although he pitched a
good game then, he is expected to be
even better against the Bruin Cubs.
He is the most experienced whirler
on the squad, having several years of
prep-school baseball at the Army and
Navy Military Academy. Fuller will
keep the home fires burning in an in
teresting manner for the Blue and
Gold twenty-of-ours if he goes any
where near as well as he has been
doing in the past.
Coach "Swede" Righter pins most
of his faith on the infield to keep the
sluggers from scoring. Strong at first
and Smurr at third have been playing
a heavy hitting game all season and
the guards of the keystone. Captain
Woodward and Deffenbach, are work
ing like a machine. The outfield will
be played by Chandler at left, Reiss,
center and either Colvin or Cole in
the right garden. Lowenstein and
Frye will be taken as relief pitchers.
The only sure dope on the Berkeley
frosh seems to be that they are heavy
on the stick. The babes have been
victorious in about the same measure
over the same teams and scores com
pare about as conclusively as the fact
that Californians have won one game
