# CUB DIAMONDERS OPEN BIG SERIES
## First Game With California Yearlings Is on Berkeley Field; Teams Match Well 
### 
The freshman battery against Cali
fornia tomorrow will have Bonner in
the box and Fuller behind the rubber.
This will be the first regular game
that Bonner has pitched since the Palo
Alto clash and although he pitched a
good game then, he is expected to be
even better against the Bruin Cubs.
He is the most experienced whirler
on the squad, having several years of
prep-school baseball at the Army and
Navy Military Academy. Fuller will
keep the home fires burning in an in
teresting manner for the Blue and
Gold twenty-of-ours if he goes any
where near as well as he has been
doing in the past.
Coach "Swede" Righter pins most
of his faith on the infield to keep the
sluggers from scoring. Strong at first
and Smurr at third have been playing
a heavy hitting game all season and
the guards of the keystone. Captain
Woodward and Deffenbach, are work
ing like a machine. The outfield will
be played by Chandler at left, Reiss,
center and either Colvin or Cole in
the right garden. Lowenstein and
Frye will be taken as relief pitchers.
The only sure dope on the Berkeley
frosh seems to be that they are heavy
on the stick. The babes have been
victorious in about the same measure
over the same teams and scores com
pare about as conclusively as the fact
that Californians have won one game
from Davis Farm and lost another. It
will be up to the infield at any event
to overbalance the slight edge the
Baby Bears have with the wands.
Heidt, a man who pitched for three
years at Culver is expected to do the
delivery with a much-touted right arm.
He has shown up as the best selection
for the mound in the previous games
this season. People who have seen
him work say that there is something
beside wind in the touting and a pitch
er's battle to some extent is expected.
It will be interesting to see whether
the baseball training of the eastern
or western military school will pull
out on top.
The game will be held across the
Bay after the freshman track meet
and will be called at the usual time.
