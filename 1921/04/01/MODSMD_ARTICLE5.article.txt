# SPANISH BALL IS GRAND FINISH TO SPRING CARNIVAL
## Elaborate Dance Will Close up Festivities of Week-end of Merry-making and Sports 
### 
A royal Spanish fiesta ball is to be
the offering of the Carnival the even
ing of the second day. Coming after
th e big track meet between Stanford
and the University of California it
will be one of the largest and most
elaborate dances that have been given
on the campus. Primarily it will be
for campus people and their friends
hut a limited number of outsiders
will be admitted. It will be a program
dance and will be informal. At first
the committee in charge headed by
W. T. Martin, '20, and Dorris Ander
son, '21, planned to have the ball a
masked affair with Spanish costumes.
The impossibility of arranging for
costuming the dancers at any price
within reason made, however, a change
to a non-costume dance necessary.
Decorations for the evening have
been worked out by Walt Gores, '17,
and he has, evolved a scheme of color
fitting the spirit of the Carnival that
will rival any of the other dance de
corations that he has put on here in
the past. A unique change from the
ordinary run of festivities of a like
sort has been made in the manner of
lighting. Stark Draper, '21, who is
in charge of the electrical work of the
Carnival has been experimenting with
Ernest Creppin, '24, with many light
ing effects and the two have worked
out a plan whereby the lights will
harmonize with the decorations and
will fill the dance hall with a soft
light that will make the whole place
like a southern twilight and yet not
offend the eye by any particular
bright spots in the whole makeup. A
large number of colored spot lights
are contemplated and may be used to
give the correct atmosphere to the
different numbers of the dance as the
evening passes.
Whitmer to Head Orchestra
Music for the dance will be differ
ent than any that has been seen around
here this year, according to the plans
of the dance committee. Ambrose
Whitmer will head the orchestra for
the evening, but he has an assemblage
of musicians lined up for the enter
tainment that will put out the brand
of syncopation offered by Ted Lewis'
Jazz Orchestra. The makeup of the
orchestra will be entirely brass in-
Htrumental pieces, and will be an in
novation in campus dance music and
should offer some of the best music
for dancing that has been heard here.
It will consist of ten pieces.
The dance committee is working on
the specialty parts for the ball now
and expects to have some novel
things to offer during the evening in
the way of variation from the regular
line of dances. Refreshments will be
a part of the dance for which there
will be no outside charge.
