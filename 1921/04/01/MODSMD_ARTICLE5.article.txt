# SPANISH BALL IS GRAND FINISH TO SPRING CARNIVAL
## Elaborate Dance Will Close up Festivities of Week-end of Merry-making and Sports 
### 
A royal Spanish fiesta ball is to be
the offering of the Carnival the even
ing of the second day. Coming after
th e big track meet between Stanford
and the University of California it
will be one of the largest and most
elaborate dances that have been given
on the campus. Primarily it will be
for campus people and their friends
hut a limited number of outsiders
will be admitted. It will be a program
dance and will be informal. At first
the committee in charge headed by
W. T. Martin, '20, and Dorris Ander
son, '21, planned to have the ball a
masked affair with Spanish costumes.
The impossibility of arranging for
costuming the dancers at any price
within reason made, however, a change
to a non-costume dance necessary.
Decorations for the evening have
been worked out by Walt Gores, '17,
and he has, evolved a scheme of color
fitting the spirit of the Carnival that
will rival any of the other dance de
corations that he has put on here in
the past. A unique change from the
ordinary run of festivities of a like
sort has been made in the manner of
lighting. Stark Draper, '21, who is
in charge of the electrical work of the
Carnival has been experimenting with
Ernest Creppin, '24, with many light
ing effects and the two have worked
out a plan whereby the lights will
harmonize with the decorations and
will fill the dance hall with a soft
light that will make the whole place
like a southern twilight and yet not
offend the eye by any particular
bright spots in the whole makeup. A
large number of colored spot lights
