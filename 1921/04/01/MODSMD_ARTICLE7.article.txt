# Templeton Dopes His Crippled Aggregation to Win 35 Points
## 
### 
Hopelessly crippled by the loss of
seven certain point winners, "Dink"
Tcmpleton's 1924 track team turned in
one week from a probable winner into
a more provable loser, faces the Cali
fornia freshmen at Berkeley tomorrow
afternoon.
Templeton figures his men should an
nex #0. possibly 35 points, against Walter
Christie's yearlings. Before the faculty
ax fell, he doped his squad to take 4(1
more.
Of the men left to compete tomorrow,
Captain Eddie Sudden is sure of ten
points in the sprints and may turn the
tide of defeat in the relay as Templeton
has decided to use him in the final lap.
Sudden's marks of 10 flat in the hundred
and 22 flat in the furlong have not been
touched by any of the Bruin babes this
year.
Scofield may spring a surprise in the
quarter, at least Templeton figures him
to place. Mcintosh should figure in the
half and Swayne should get a second or
a third but of the mile.
Kemnitzcr is doped to place in the
hurdles, and Ludekc, the big fellow who
held down a guard on the freshman foot
hall team last fall, is figured to win the
shot, and place in the discus, high jump
and possibly the javelin. The relay
may go to Stanford with Sudden run
ning last man.
Templeton figures that about concludes

his point men, although several others
may pull the "come through" stunt to
morrow.
Many Points Lost
The men the Cardinal mentor had be
fore the deluge were figured to grab
close to forty points and cinch the meet
for the Stanford first-year men for the
first time in history. Glen Hartranft
was doped to win the discus as he is a
consistent 135-foot man He or Bowers
would have taken the shot without
trouble as both were consistent at 44 feet
and Bowers has recently heaved the 16-
pound ball close to the 48-foot mark, as
good a record as has been made here
since the days of "Here" Bihlman.
Hartranft was also scheduled to annex
points in the broad jump and the javelin.
Bowers was good for first in the shot
and a second in the discus with a record
of 130 feet. "Scotchy" Campbell should
have won the javelin as his mark of 155
feet is ten feet better than any Cali
fornia thrower has done in competition.
Jim Arthur, who was forced to leave
college for other than scholarship rea
sons, was figured to place in the Jiigh
jump and the broad jump and had an
outside chance in the shot. Thurmand
Clarke was a favorite to win the quar
ter, to place in the 220 and to make the
relay team a sure winner. The other
two men. Wilcox and Dakc, were strong
in the sprints and the pole vault, re
spectively.
The Stanford entries at California to
morrow will be:
100 yards—Sudden (captain), Reed,
Coulter, Miller.
220 yards—Sudden, Reed, Coulter,
Miller.

hurdles, and Ludekc, the big fellow who
held down a guard on the freshman foot
hall team last fall, is figured to win the
shot, and place in the discus, high jump
and possibly the javelin. The relay
may go to Stanford with Sudden run
ning last man.
Templeton figures that about concludes

his point men, although several others
may pull the "come through" stunt to
morrow.
Many Points Lost
The men the Cardinal mentor had be
fore the deluge were figured to grab
close to forty points and cinch the meet
for the Stanford first-year men for the
first time in history. Glen Hartranft
was doped to win the discus as he is a
consistent 135-foot man He or Bowers
would have taken the shot without
trouble as both were consistent at 44 feet
and Bowers has recently heaved the 16-
pound ball close to the 48-foot mark, as
good a record as has been made here
since the days of "Here" Bihlman.
Hartranft was also scheduled to annex
points in the broad jump and the javelin.
Bowers was good for first in the shot
and a second in the discus with a record
of 130 feet. "Scotchy" Campbell should
have won the javelin as his mark of 155
feet is ten feet better than any Cali
fornia thrower has done in competition.
Jim Arthur, who was forced to leave
college for other than scholarship rea
sons, was figured to place in the Jiigh
jump and the broad jump and had an
outside chance in the shot. Thurmand
Clarke was a favorite to win the quar
ter, to place in the 220 and to make the
relay team a sure winner. The other
two men. Wilcox and Dakc, were strong
in the sprints and the pole vault, re
spectively.
The Stanford entries at California to
morrow will be:
100 yards—Sudden (captain), Reed,
Coulter, Miller.
220 yards—Sudden, Reed, Coulter,
Miller.
440 yards—Scofield, Coverly, Ten
nant.
B.SO yards—Mcintosh, Wilson.

Hopelessly crippled by the loss of
seven certain point winners, "Dink"
Tcmpleton's 1924 track team turned in
one week from a probable winner into
a more provable loser, faces the Cali
fornia freshmen at Berkeley tomorrow
afternoon.
Templeton figures his men should an
nex #0. possibly 35 points, against Walter
Christie's yearlings. Before the faculty
ax fell, he doped his squad to take 4(1
more.
Of the men left to compete tomorrow,
Captain Eddie Sudden is sure of ten
points in the sprints and may turn the
tide of defeat in the relay as Templeton
has decided to use him in the final lap.
Sudden's marks of 10 flat in the hundred
and 22 flat in the furlong have not been
touched by any of the Bruin babes this
year.
Scofield may spring a surprise in the
quarter, at least Templeton figures him
to place. Mcintosh should figure in the
half and Swayne should get a second or
a third but of the mile.
Kemnitzcr is doped to place in the
hurdles, and Ludekc, the big fellow who
