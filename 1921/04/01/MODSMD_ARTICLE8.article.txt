# VARSITY NINE OPENS SERIES WITH CALIFORNIA SATURDAY ON LOCAL'S DIAMOND AT 3
## Green and Bundy, and O'Neill and Toomey, Slated as Batteries in Initial Stanford â€“ Bruin Contest 
### 
California's baseball varsity under the watchful eye of Coach Zamlock worked
out on the local diamond yesterday afternoon in preparation for the opening game
of the annual series with Coach Seay's Cardinal baseballers tomorrow afternoon.
"Zam" put the boys through their paces for more than two hours and they
appeared to be a fast and fighting ball club.
Seay's nine took the field after the Berkeleyites had finished their workout
and also showed plenty of the old pepper. After seeing the two teams in practice
it is safe to say that tomorrow's contest will be a close and hard fought affair.
Each team, of course, will attempt to grab the edge on the series by taking the
opener and things exciting are bound to happen.
Green and Bundy will be the battery for Stanford, opposing O'Neill and
Toomey for the Bruins. Green is inexperienced as to years as a heaver but he
has been tossing a variety of stuff in the practice games that has stamped him as a

real pitcher. His fast ball is a bird and
he uses a change of pace that would do
credit to an old head in the game. Be
sides that, Green hits a little on his own
account and is one of the most dangerous
batters on the team.
O'Neill has been pitching college base
ball for several years and is - , regarded as
one of the craftiest boxmen in Pacific
Coast college baseball circles'. While not
blessed with quantities of "stuff" he has
worlds of control and knows what to
pitch and when. If both these slabsters
are in top form the fans should be
treated to a real pitchers' duel on the
morrow.
Bundy and "Crip" Toomey arc both
experienced catchers, so the hurlers will
not lack in support tomorrow.
Seay has not definitely decided upon
the combination that he will use around
second base. Mitchell and Kallam have
been working the angles around the key
stone bay throughout the season with
good success, but Michell may be needed
in the outfield, necessitating a change
in the personnel of the second base com
bination. In case Mitchell goes back to
outfielding for this series Kallam will
be moved over to second base and "Red"
Maillot will take care of the short patch.
Patterson will hold forth at the initial
corner and "Lefty" Hcckendorf will
take care of the line drives and bunts at
third base.
The California infield is composed of
Hermle, first base, White, second base,
H. Makin, third base, and G. Makin,
shortstop. Hermle is leading the in
fielders in hitting with an average of .350
for the first seven games of the season.
H. Makin is also rapping the ball for a
good average and is second to Hemle
with .333 for six games. The other two
infielders are both under the .300 mark.
Captain "Moke" Meyers, who plays
center field, is leading the Bruins in
sticking with the large average of .384
for seven games. The rest of the out
field is made up of Rome in right field
and Douthit, of basketball fame, and
Radebaugh alternating in left field.
"Mort" Kline will be in left field and
