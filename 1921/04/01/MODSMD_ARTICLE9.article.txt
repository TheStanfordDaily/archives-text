# HEALY CONCERT TO BE GIVEN TONIGHT
## Madame Frances Alda Will Be Heard in Recital; Theodore Flint Will Be Accompanist 
### 
Mine. Frances Alda, star soprano of
the Metropolitan, will give the closing
recital of the Healy concert series this
evening at 8:15 in the Assembly Hall.
Mme. Alda is one of the foremost so
pranos now on the concert stage and is
declared by those fully competent to
judge to be among the best, if not the
best, solo artist at present before the
public. She occupies a Secure place in
the music world as an artist of rare
personality, and competent critics have
said of her that no soprano has a more
beautiful voice, a more winning person
ality or more versatility in her art than
has Mme. Alda.
As is well known, Alda's career in
opera has been a series of notable suc
cesses. Her popularity with the Metro
politan audiences has been steadily
growing. And she is equally at home
on the concert stage. Her remarkable
popularity as a concert artist is found in
the fact that every place in which she
appeared last season has made special
request for her reappearance this sea
son, with the result that before the sea
son opened she was booked for more
than seventy concerts. Those familiar
with the methods by which Alda attained
her success are aware of the fact that
success came to her not suddenly nor
over night, but after years of patient
and persistent devotion to principles in-
by early teachings, based (in the
best traditions in vocal art.
