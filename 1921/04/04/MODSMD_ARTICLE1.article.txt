# STANFORD LOSES FIRST GAME TO BERKELEY NINE
## Green and Morrow Engage in Pitchers' Duel Ending With Victory for Visitors, 6-3 
### Harry J. Borba, '22 
Stanford lost the opening game of
the annual "serious" to California,
after one of the nippest and tuckest
nine-inning affairs staged on the local
lot this season. Kvery angle of base
ball from the sacrifice strike-out
through the balk and down to a near
fisticuff battle was put on for the edi
fication of the fans of which there
were a goodly crowd on hand. The
Bruins took the large end of a 6 to 3
score.
Green pitched the entire game for
Stanford and let the Berkeley gang
down with six blows but the visitors
made every one of the six count. They
grabbod them off in bunches of two,
and every two counted for a pair of
tallies. It was all in aIL a nifty brand
of baseball that Green put out and
had he had better support the story
told here might have been different.
Green got into hot water in the
first inning when "Moke" Myers, lead
off man for California, poked a liner
at Heckendorf which "Lefty" was un
able to handle. "Moke" took the world
by surprise when he stole second on
the first pitched ball. Hermle got
a puny single infield and Myers moved
on to third. Ent|r now G. Makin,
shortstop and brother of H. Makin,
third baseman. George poled a line
drive which Mort Kline collected in
deep center field and Myers started
for the plate. But he had reckoned
without the arm of Kline, who shot the
ball home on a perfect line and Bundy
rot tho California captain a» he slid
into the plate, completing a double
play. Then, with two men out, Green
proceeded to whiff "Shad" Rowe, but
Bundy dropped the last strike, a spit
ball, which Rowe had missed by a
foot and Rowe started for first base.
Bundy made a quick recovery and a
hasty throw but the moist ball slipped
out of hiß hand and finished up in
right field. Before it was returned
to the inner circle Hermle and Rowe
had both made the circuit.
Things eased along for three innings
with Green pitching nice ball and
"Mike" Morrow, who was twirling for
California, holding the Cardinal nine
well in hand. In tho fourth frame,
Stanford broke loose and scored its
first tally of the game.
Mitchell, leading off, poked a nice
single into right field, the first hit off
Morrow. Kallam sacrificed, moving
Mitchell to second. Carver was re
tired infield, bringing Mort Kline, hero
of tho first inning double play, into
the scene. Kline, after fouling a ball
in each and every direction of the com
pass without a single repetition, drove
ono into center field scoring Mitchell.
Kline immediately purloined second
