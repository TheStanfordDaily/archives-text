# STANFORD LOSES FIRST GAME TO BERKELEY NINE
## Green and Morrow Engage in Pitchers' Duel Ending With Victory for Visitors, 6-3 
### Harry J. Borba, '22 
Stanford lost the opening game of
the annual "serious" to California,
after one of the nippest and tuckest
nine-inning affairs staged on the local
lot this season. Kvery angle of base
ball from the sacrifice strike-out
through the balk and down to a near
fisticuff battle was put on for the edi
fication of the fans of which there
were a goodly crowd on hand. The
Bruins took the large end of a 6 to 3
score.
Green pitched the entire game for
Stanford and let the Berkeley gang
down with six blows but the visitors
made every one of the six count. They
grabbod them off in bunches of two,
and every two counted for a pair of
tallies. It was all in aIL a nifty brand
of baseball that Green put out and
had he had better support the story
told here might have been different.
Green got into hot water in the
first inning when "Moke" Myers, lead
off man for California, poked a liner
at Heckendorf which "Lefty" was un
able to handle. "Moke" took the world
by surprise when he stole second on
the first pitched ball. Hermle got
a puny single infield and Myers moved
on to third. Ent|r now G. Makin,
shortstop and brother of H. Makin,
third baseman. George poled a line
drive which Mort Kline collected in
deep center field and Myers started
for the plate. But he had reckoned
without the arm of Kline, who shot the
ball home on a perfect line and Bundy
rot tho California captain a» he slid
into the plate, completing a double
play. Then, with two men out, Green
proceeded to whiff "Shad" Rowe, but
Bundy dropped the last strike, a spit
ball, which Rowe had missed by a
foot and Rowe started for first base.
Bundy made a quick recovery and a
hasty throw but the moist ball slipped
out of hiß hand and finished up in
right field. Before it was returned
to the inner circle Hermle and Rowe
had both made the circuit.
Things eased along for three innings
with Green pitching nice ball and
"Mike" Morrow, who was twirling for
California, holding the Cardinal nine
well in hand. In tho fourth frame,
Stanford broke loose and scored its
first tally of the game.
Mitchell, leading off, poked a nice
single into right field, the first hit off
Morrow. Kallam sacrificed, moving
Mitchell to second. Carver was re
tired infield, bringing Mort Kline, hero
of tho first inning double play, into
the scene. Kline, after fouling a ball
in each and every direction of the com
pass without a single repetition, drove
ono into center field scoring Mitchell.
Kline immediately purloined second
base but stopped there when Hecken
dorf was retired at first base for the
third out.
Again in the sixtn frame Seay's nine
got into action and took unto them
selves another marker. Mitchell was
out infield, Kanam drove a scorcher
down the third base line and then stole
second base Carver poised to the
short stop, again bringing Mortimer
Klin a to the fore. Kline it seemed
had his mind set on copping the stel
lar honors for the day. for he unwound
; another knock to center field that was
good for two bags, scoring Kallam,
and tieing the score at two all
This seemed to arouse the ire of
Piamloek's cohorts for they got to
vengeance. Redebaugh was out on a
Green in the seventh inning with a
pop fly to Patterson but H. Makiu,
not to be outdone by his shortstopping
brother hit a two-bagger into left
field. , White, reputed to be the weak
hitter of the club, lammed another
two ply swat, this time into center
field, scoring Makin. White took third
on the throw to the plate. Morrow
hit a long fly that Kline was forced
to go to deep center to take in and
following the catch White started for
the plate. Kline riflled another per
fect peg to the plate but the distance 1
was too great and White beat the
throw in, making the score 4 to 2 in
favor of California.
With two out in the Stanford half
of the seventh, Captain Bundy started
a rally that for a time threatened to
swamp the Blue and Gold outfit. He
singled to left field. Green was safe
when Ilermle dropped a throw from
Makin. Mitchell bingled infield and
the bases were fuller than a bonded
warehouse. Kallam stood at the plate
long enough to have three balls and
two strikes called on him and then
Bundy started for the plate on the
sixth pitch. The umpire called it a
ball, all hands moved around' and
Bundy was across the plate with the
thi*d Stanford run. With the bags
still choked, Carver came to the plate.
He failed to examine any of Morrow's
wares to see if he was still wild, but
popped the first one for a puny fly to
second base ending the inning."^
The Bruins added their final two
runs in the eight inning. Hermle drew
a base on balls, and Makin sacrificed
advancing him to second base. "Shad"
Rowe drove one over Mitchell's head
for three bases scoring Hermle.
Smith bunted and Rowe crossed the
plate with the final run of the game
as he was being tossed out at first
base.
From the viewpoint of the specta
tors the game was a dinger with
plenty of opportunities to root and the
result always uncertain until the last
man was retired in the ninth inning.
Both teams seemed to be evenly
matched, California having the edge
only in the infield. If the second
game of the series at Berkeley next
Saturday is to be anything like the
first we are going to dtart walking
to the scene Friday night.

first inning when "Moke" Myers, lead
off man for California, poked a liner
at Heckendorf which "Lefty" was un
able to handle. "Moke" took the world
by surprise when he stole second on
the first pitched ball. Hermle got
a puny single infield and Myers moved
on to third. Ent|r now G. Makin,
shortstop and brother of H. Makin,
third baseman. George poled a line
drive which Mort Kline collected in
deep center field and Myers started
for the plate. But he had reckoned
without the arm of Kline, who shot the
ball home on a perfect line and Bundy
rot tho California captain a» he slid
into the plate, completing a double
play. Then, with two men out, Green
proceeded to whiff "Shad" Rowe, but
Bundy dropped the last strike, a spit
ball, which Rowe had missed by a
foot and Rowe started for first base.
Bundy made a quick recovery and a
hasty throw but the moist ball slipped
out of hiß hand and finished up in
right field. Before it was returned
to the inner circle Hermle and Rowe
had both made the circuit.
Things eased along for three innings
with Green pitching nice ball and
"Mike" Morrow, who was twirling for
California, holding the Cardinal nine
well in hand. In tho fourth frame,
Stanford broke loose and scored its
first tally of the game.
Mitchell, leading off, poked a nice
single into right field, the first hit off
Morrow. Kallam sacrificed, moving
Mitchell to second. Carver was re
tired infield, bringing Mort Kline, hero
of tho first inning double play, into
the scene. Kline, after fouling a ball
in each and every direction of the com
pass without a single repetition, drove
ono into center field scoring Mitchell.
Kline immediately purloined second
base but stopped there when Hecken
dorf was retired at first base for the
third out.
Again in the sixtn frame Seay's nine
got into action and took unto them
selves another marker. Mitchell was
out infield, Kanam drove a scorcher
down the third base line and then stole
second base Carver poised to the
short stop, again bringing Mortimer
Klin a to the fore. Kline it seemed
had his mind set on copping the stel
lar honors for the day. for he unwound
; another knock to center field that was
good for two bags, scoring Kallam,
and tieing the score at two all
This seemed to arouse the ire of
Piamloek's cohorts for they got to
vengeance. Redebaugh was out on a
Green in the seventh inning with a
pop fly to Patterson but H. Makiu,
not to be outdone by his shortstopping
brother hit a two-bagger into left
field. , White, reputed to be the weak
hitter of the club, lammed another
two ply swat, this time into center
field, scoring Makin. White took third
on the throw to the plate. Morrow
hit a long fly that Kline was forced
to go to deep center to take in and
following the catch White started for
the plate. Kline riflled another per
fect peg to the plate but the distance 1
was too great and White beat the
throw in, making the score 4 to 2 in
favor of California.
With two out in the Stanford half
of the seventh, Captain Bundy started
a rally that for a time threatened to
swamp the Blue and Gold outfit. He
singled to left field. Green was safe
when Ilermle dropped a throw from
Makin. Mitchell bingled infield and
the bases were fuller than a bonded
warehouse. Kallam stood at the plate
long enough to have three balls and
two strikes called on him and then
Bundy started for the plate on the
sixth pitch. The umpire called it a
ball, all hands moved around' and
Bundy was across the plate with the
thi*d Stanford run. With the bags
still choked, Carver came to the plate.
He failed to examine any of Morrow's
wares to see if he was still wild, but
popped the first one for a puny fly to
second base ending the inning."^
The Bruins added their final two
runs in the eight inning. Hermle drew
a base on balls, and Makin sacrificed
advancing him to second base. "Shad"
Rowe drove one over Mitchell's head
for three bases scoring Hermle.
Smith bunted and Rowe crossed the
plate with the final run of the game
as he was being tossed out at first
base.
From the viewpoint of the specta
tors the game was a dinger with
plenty of opportunities to root and the
result always uncertain until the last
man was retired in the ninth inning.
Both teams seemed to be evenly
matched, California having the edge
only in the infield. If the second
game of the series at Berkeley next
Saturday is to be anything like the
first we are going to dtart walking
to the scene Friday night.

Stanford lost the opening game of
the annual "serious" to California,

nine-inning affairs staged on the local
lot this season. Kvery angle of base
ball from the sacrifice strike-out
through the balk and down to a near
fisticuff battle was put on for the edi

were a goodly crowd on hand. The
Bruins took the large end of a 6 to 3
score.
Green pitched the entire game for
Stanford and let the Berkeley gang
down with six blows but the visitors
made every one of the six count. They
grabbod them off in bunches of two,
and every two counted for a pair of

right field. Before it was returned
to the inner circle Hermle and Rowe
had both made the circuit.
Things eased along for three innings
with Green pitching nice ball and
"Mike" Morrow, who was twirling for
California, holding the Cardinal nine
well in hand. In tho fourth frame,
Stanford broke loose and scored its
first tally of the game.
Mitchell, leading off, poked a nice
single into right field, the first hit off
Morrow. Kallam sacrificed, moving
Mitchell to second. Carver was re
tired infield, bringing Mort Kline, hero
of tho first inning double play, into
the scene. Kline, after fouling a ball
in each and every direction of the com
pass without a single repetition, drove
ono into center field scoring Mitchell.
Kline immediately purloined second
base but stopped there when Hecken
dorf was retired at first base for the
third out.
Again in the sixtn frame Seay's nine
got into action and took unto them
selves another marker. Mitchell was
out infield, Kanam drove a scorcher
down the third base line and then stole
second base Carver poised to the
short stop, again bringing Mortimer
Klin a to the fore. Kline it seemed
had his mind set on copping the stel
lar honors for the day. for he unwound
; another knock to center field that was
good for two bags, scoring Kallam,
and tieing the score at two all
This seemed to arouse the ire of
Piamloek's cohorts for they got to
vengeance. Redebaugh was out on a
Green in the seventh inning with a
pop fly to Patterson but H. Makiu,
not to be outdone by his shortstopping
brother hit a two-bagger into left
field. , White, reputed to be the weak
hitter of the club, lammed another
two ply swat, this time into center
field, scoring Makin. White took third
on the throw to the plate. Morrow
hit a long fly that Kline was forced
to go to deep center to take in and
following the catch White started for
the plate. Kline riflled another per
fect peg to the plate but the distance 1
was too great and White beat the
throw in, making the score 4 to 2 in
favor of California.
With two out in the Stanford half
of the seventh, Captain Bundy started
a rally that for a time threatened to
swamp the Blue and Gold outfit. He
singled to left field. Green was safe
when Ilermle dropped a throw from
Makin. Mitchell bingled infield and
the bases were fuller than a bonded
warehouse. Kallam stood at the plate
long enough to have three balls and
two strikes called on him and then
Bundy started for the plate on the
sixth pitch. The umpire called it a
ball, all hands moved around' and
Bundy was across the plate with the
thi*d Stanford run. With the bags
still choked, Carver came to the plate.
He failed to examine any of Morrow's
wares to see if he was still wild, but
popped the first one for a puny fly to
second base ending the inning."^
The Bruins added their final two
runs in the eight inning. Hermle drew
a base on balls, and Makin sacrificed
advancing him to second base. "Shad"
Rowe drove one over Mitchell's head
for three bases scoring Hermle.
Smith bunted and Rowe crossed the
plate with the final run of the game
as he was being tossed out at first
base.
From the viewpoint of the specta
tors the game was a dinger with
plenty of opportunities to root and the
result always uncertain until the last
man was retired in the ninth inning.
Both teams seemed to be evenly
matched, California having the edge
only in the infield. If the second
game of the series at Berkeley next
Saturday is to be anything like the
first we are going to dtart walking
to the scene Friday night.

Stanford lost the opening game of
the annual "serious" to California,
after one of the nippest and tuckest
nine-inning affairs staged on the local
lot this season. Kvery angle of base
ball from the sacrifice strike-out
through the balk and down to a near
fisticuff battle was put on for the edi
fication of the fans of which there
were a goodly crowd on hand. The
Bruins took the large end of a 6 to 3
score.
Green pitched the entire game for
Stanford and let the Berkeley gang
down with six blows but the visitors
made every one of the six count. They
grabbod them off in bunches of two,
and every two counted for a pair of
tallies. It was all in aIL a nifty brand
of baseball that Green put out and
had he had better support the story
told here might have been different.
Green got into hot water in the
first inning when "Moke" Myers, lead
off man for California, poked a liner
at Heckendorf which "Lefty" was un
able to handle. "Moke" took the world
by surprise when he stole second on
the first pitched ball. Hermle got
a puny single infield and Myers moved
on to third. Ent|r now G. Makin,
shortstop and brother of H. Makin,
third baseman. George poled a line
drive which Mort Kline collected in
deep center field and Myers started
for the plate. But he had reckoned
without the arm of Kline, who shot the
ball home on a perfect line and Bundy
rot tho California captain a» he slid
into the plate, completing a double
play. Then, with two men out, Green
proceeded to whiff "Shad" Rowe, but
Bundy dropped the last strike, a spit
ball, which Rowe had missed by a
foot and Rowe started for first base.

down the third base line and then stole
second base Carver poised to the
short stop, again bringing Mortimer
Klin a to the fore. Kline it seemed
had his mind set on copping the stel
lar honors for the day. for he unwound
; another knock to center field that was
good for two bags, scoring Kallam,
and tieing the score at two all
This seemed to arouse the ire of
Piamloek's cohorts for they got to
vengeance. Redebaugh was out on a
Green in the seventh inning with a
pop fly to Patterson but H. Makiu,
not to be outdone by his shortstopping
brother hit a two-bagger into left
field. , White, reputed to be the weak
hitter of the club, lammed another
two ply swat, this time into center
field, scoring Makin. White took third
on the throw to the plate. Morrow
hit a long fly that Kline was forced
to go to deep center to take in and
following the catch White started for
the plate. Kline riflled another per
fect peg to the plate but the distance 1
was too great and White beat the
throw in, making the score 4 to 2 in
favor of California.
With two out in the Stanford half
of the seventh, Captain Bundy started
a rally that for a time threatened to
swamp the Blue and Gold outfit. He
singled to left field. Green was safe
when Ilermle dropped a throw from
Makin. Mitchell bingled infield and
the bases were fuller than a bonded
warehouse. Kallam stood at the plate
long enough to have three balls and
two strikes called on him and then
Bundy started for the plate on the
sixth pitch. The umpire called it a
ball, all hands moved around' and
Bundy was across the plate with the
thi*d Stanford run. With the bags
still choked, Carver came to the plate.
He failed to examine any of Morrow's
wares to see if he was still wild, but
popped the first one for a puny fly to
second base ending the inning."^
The Bruins added their final two
runs in the eight inning. Hermle drew
a base on balls, and Makin sacrificed
advancing him to second base. "Shad"
Rowe drove one over Mitchell's head
for three bases scoring Hermle.
Smith bunted and Rowe crossed the
plate with the final run of the game
as he was being tossed out at first
base.
From the viewpoint of the specta
tors the game was a dinger with
plenty of opportunities to root and the
result always uncertain until the last
man was retired in the ninth inning.
Both teams seemed to be evenly
matched, California having the edge
only in the infield. If the second
game of the series at Berkeley next
Saturday is to be anything like the
first we are going to dtart walking
to the scene Friday night.
