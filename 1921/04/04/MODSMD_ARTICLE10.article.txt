# RIGHTER'S BALI TEAM LOSES FIRST GAME IN THE CALIFORNIA SEES
## 
### 
The first clash of the three game
series between the Stanford Freshman
and California's yearlings ended with
the Berkeley club on the large end of
a 6-4 score. The feature of the game
was the coldness of the weather, and
as a feature the wind demanded and

the third baseman, who after the shock
of seeing the ball safely lodged in his
glove regained enough conscienceness to
throw Strong out off first. The in
ning never was the same again and
the Frosh took the field without an
other score.
California in the next half of the
same inning regained their lead on a
double of Sears' with two on. That
cinched the game and the last red-legs
to cross the plate came in after it was
