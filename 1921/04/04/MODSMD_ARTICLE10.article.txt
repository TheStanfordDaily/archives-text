# RIGHTER'S BALI TEAM LOSES FIRST GAME IN THE CALIFORNIA SEES
## 
### 
The first clash of the three game
series between the Stanford Freshman
and California's yearlings ended with
the Berkeley club on the large end of
a 6-4 score. The feature of the game
was the coldness of the weather, and
as a feature the wind demanded and
got a big share of the attention. Bud
Woodward, piloting the active destinies
of "Swede" Righter's wards, played the
one star game in the otherwise poor
exhibition of baseball. From his po
sition at shortstop he not only effec
tively kept up the morale, but played
a spectacular game and in the swatting
department, never failed to reach first.
The game -started out with a dash.
'After the invading team had been re
tired, the Cal fireworks started. The
first seven men were looked over and
not 'til after two had scored did the
yearlings once more take the field. The
next run was Stanford's in the third
inning, and the home plate was not
crossed again until during the reign of
the great rally. This was in the fifth.
Woodward hit, and stole second. Rees
followed with a neat drive over first.
For a while it looked as if the icing
process was being applied to the game
by the Cardinal Freshmen. Woodward
and Rees came home on Strong's single
and the two runs, making the score
three to two for the visitors, looked
like clear profit as no outs were made
in getting them. Then came the dis
aster. Deffenbach hit a hot liner to
the third baseman, who after the shock
of seeing the ball safely lodged in his
glove regained enough conscienceness to
throw Strong out off first. The in
ning never was the same again and
the Frosh took the field without an
other score.
California in the next half of the
same inning regained their lead on a
double of Sears' with two on. That
cinched the game and the last red-legs
to cross the plate came in after it was
too late to bolster up morale. Califor
nia already had too decisive a lead, as
they had meanwhile scored twice. The
game ended a poor 6-4.
The outfield made most of the Car
dinal errors, the infield playing very
fair ball, showing evidence of good
and careful coaching. The California
aggregation was well rounded out, er
rors better distributed, more hitters, and
a bit steadier in the battery. Stanford
had more hits and fewer errors, but
could not group their assets well
enough. The pitchers were about equal
ly matched, with the hits and strike
outs in largest number on Heidt's side
and the support on Bonner's. Five hits
and seven errors were scored for Cali
fornia's Freshmen and seven hits and
five errors for Stanford's.
The next game of the series will be
played here next Saturday and this
week's practice will probably be de
voted to combating the Blue's lucky
combination of hits and gifts.
The summary is as follows:
Batteries: Heidt and Stitt, Stan
ford; Bonner and Fuller, California,
runs, 6; hits, 5; errors, Stanford,
runs, 4; hits, 7; errors, 5. Struckout:
By Heidt, 9; by Bonner, 3.

combination of hits and gifts.
The summary is as follows:
Batteries: Heidt and Stitt, Stan
ford; Bonner and Fuller, California,
runs, 6; hits, 5; errors, Stanford,
runs, 4; hits, 7; errors, 5. Struckout:

The first clash of the three game
series between the Stanford Freshman
and California's yearlings ended with
the Berkeley club on the large end of
a 6-4 score. The feature of the game
was the coldness of the weather, and
as a feature the wind demanded and
got a big share of the attention. Bud
Woodward, piloting the active destinies
of "Swede" Righter's wards, played the
one star game in the otherwise poor
exhibition of baseball. From his po
sition at shortstop he not only effec
tively kept up the morale, but played
a spectacular game and in the swatting
department, never failed to reach first.
The game -started out with a dash.
'After the invading team had been re
tired, the Cal fireworks started. The
first seven men were looked over and
not 'til after two had scored did the
yearlings once more take the field. The
next run was Stanford's in the third
inning, and the home plate was not
crossed again until during the reign of
the great rally. This was in the fifth.
Woodward hit, and stole second. Rees
followed with a neat drive over first.
For a while it looked as if the icing
process was being applied to the game
by the Cardinal Freshmen. Woodward
and Rees came home on Strong's single
and the two runs, making the score
three to two for the visitors, looked
like clear profit as no outs were made
in getting them. Then came the dis
aster. Deffenbach hit a hot liner to
the third baseman, who after the shock
of seeing the ball safely lodged in his
glove regained enough conscienceness to
throw Strong out off first. The in
ning never was the same again and
the Frosh took the field without an
other score.
California in the next half of the
same inning regained their lead on a
double of Sears' with two on. That
cinched the game and the last red-legs
to cross the plate came in after it was
too late to bolster up morale. Califor
nia already had too decisive a lead, as
they had meanwhile scored twice. The
game ended a poor 6-4.
The outfield made most of the Car
dinal errors, the infield playing very
fair ball, showing evidence of good
and careful coaching. The California
aggregation was well rounded out, er
rors better distributed, more hitters, and
a bit steadier in the battery. Stanford
had more hits and fewer errors, but
could not group their assets well
enough. The pitchers were about equal
ly matched, with the hits and strike
outs in largest number on Heidt's side
and the support on Bonner's. Five hits
and seven errors were scored for Cali
fornia's Freshmen and seven hits and
five errors for Stanford's.
The next game of the series will be
played here next Saturday and this
week's practice will probably be de
voted to combating the Blue's lucky
combination of hits and gifts.
