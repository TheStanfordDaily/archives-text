# HILDEBRAND IS 1921 WINNER OF JOFFRE DEBATE
## Clifton Hildebrand Awarded French Medal in Annual Extempore Forensic Clash 
### 
Clifton Hildebrand of (he University
of California is the owner of the 1921
Joffree medal as the result of the
judges decision in the twenty-seventh
annual forensic contest between Stan
ford and alCifornia speakers held in
the Assembly Hall Saturday night.
debrand, who was the only member of
the two trios with previous Joffre ex
perience, did not produce as good ar
gument as other speakers, but has an
effective delivery that won him the de
cision.
Representing Stanford in the contest
were Wylie Kilpatrick, '23, Laurence
Martin, "21 and Vernon Green, '21. Ar
thur Murphy, Clifton Hildebrand and
Grace Deitz comprised the Gold and
Bhte trio.
After three months' study on the gen
eral question, "France and the Treaty
of Versailles," the six speakers heard
the specific question which regarded the
wisdom of enforcement of reparation
clauses in the treaty, two hours before
the debate. The topic for discussion
was chosen by Professor Frederick A.
Ogg of the University of Wisconsin.
After choosing sides and order of ap
pearance, the contestants retired to out
line the question for the extemporan
eous clash. Laurence Martin, of Stan
ford, opened the debate for the affirma
tive and was followed by Arthur Mur-
Pierce and Sudden started off about
five yards apart. Eddie passed him,
and held the lead up to the last turn,
when he was himself passed. Both
were almost spent when with a mighty
effort Sudden pulled into an even faster
sprint than he had been traveling and
finished a yard to the good.
The weather was gray and cold
enough to make eastern tourists won
der why it was they left home. This
very likely effected some of the events,
the jumps in particular. Five feet seven
and one-half inches marked the limit of
the four leapers, who traveled the up
trail and Boren, who has been going
as far as 23 feet in the broad jump,
won with the mark of 22 feet 4 inches.
