this project as it is for the good of the
University, and this is the first time
I any action has been made toward the
project. Concerts, l>ands and Glee

given the same old back drop of scen
ery and with the help of the new cur
tains this ugly drop can be done away
with. It can also be used to a great

will be accepted at any time and may
be addressed to the Dramatic Council,
care of Gordon Davis. There will be
