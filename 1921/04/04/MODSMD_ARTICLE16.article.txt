# A 						POOR MAN'S UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
The impression lias long prevailed in many quarters that
Stanford is a wealthy man's college. It has even been thought a "snob
school." How the latter idea could gain any ground is beyond com
prehension of students who have lived in the peculiar Stanford com
munity where each may live his own life and within reason be what he
pleases, and where a man is recognized more for what he is and less
for the organization to wlfrch he may belong than probably in any large
university with which we are familiar.
The opinions that Stanford is a "rich man's college' may have in
part been gained from the somewhat aristocratic traditions surrounding
the founding of the University. It has been immensely increased where
cver it existed by the first reaction to tuition at Stanford, and in many
cases expressions of our own students and alumni have convinced able
high school men that this is no place, for any man who may have a
limited income or who may have to work for a part or all of his expenses.
As a matter of fact living expenses are nowhere less for college
men than here on the campus. Of course, expenses here vary, but the
new students here may find the worth-while friends, companions, col
lege athletes, and officers rather equally divided between the less costly
and more costly close organizations, and groups which are not organi
zations at all.
Men who have lived on Stanford and other western campuses tell
us that the new tuition here will about equalize the cost of attending
this and other supposedly inexpensive universities. This may or may
not be an accurate representation, but the fact that some men believe it
true indicates that there can be no great difference one way or the other
in the present cost of attending western colleges.
This, together with the fact that students who need aid may take
out seven-year tuition notes with the University, at a very small interest
rate, probably make this the most easily accessible university to stu
dents with limited means. Such students need not, of course, take
out notes all through a college career. Any student who really wants
to work can after a time find something to do, and after the first two
quarters here he may not need further notes.
If Stanford ever becomes a "rich man's college," it will not be on
account of the cost of attending the university, but because of im
pressions crcated that will keep men who are not wealthy away.
Students should make the true facts known.
