# LOWELL HIGH BEATS FRESHMEN IN AQUATIC MEET IN LOCAL POOL
## 
### 
Lowell High School's swimming team
came down Saturday and went back to
San Francisco with the long end of a
40-28 score, after meeting the freshman
swimmers. The freshman squad did not
look so bad as the score would indicate,
and they would probably have won had
Captain Fletcher been able to be pres
ent. Additional points in the breast and
back stroke and the relay would have
been gathered in by Fletcher and the
result would have been different.
The biggest point winner for the
freshmen was Schmieder, who gathered
in 6. White and Van Duesen each got
5 and Hooper came across with 4. Low
ell's star was O'Brien, who got 10 of
their 40 points. The relay race was
won by Lowell The Freshmen cap
tured three first places ,to Lowell's
four.
The water polo game ended in a 1-1
tie. Captain Hooper's men put up a
good exhibition, but lack of time pre
prevented the game b 'mg playedÂ« its
full length.
Next Saturday the freshmen meet
Berkeley here in a swimming carnival
ard water polo game.
