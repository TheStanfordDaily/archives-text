### 
A three-day campaign for advance j
sales of the 1922 Quad will begin on

pervision of the manager of t.he year
book. William H. Vosburgh. Try
outees for the managership of the '23
Quad will be stationed on the Engi
neering corner to take orders for the
book at the price of $5.50.
An unusually large early sale of the
forthcoming Quad has left but a com
paratively small number of volumes
unsold. Thirteen hundred copies of
the Quad are being printed. Of this
number 400 were ordered by the juni
ors during the autumn quarter. An
additional 500 have been disposed of
since the beginning of the present
quarter, leaving but 400 copies to be
sold during the three-day campaign.
Careful buying methods have en
abled the Quad management to re
tain and extend the color designs,
which have made the Quad distinctive
among collegiate year-books. Stan
ford will be fortunate in this respect
as a number of universities this year
were to discontinue part of the art
work in their yearbooks.
The motif of the buildings of the
Quad has been carried out through
out the entire book. The cover de
sign, by Margaret Polliamus, shows a
Stanford arch with the Memorial
! Church in tho background. The same
theme is extended through the title
pages. While the Cardinal cover is
suggestive of the red tile roofs of the
Quad, the buff sandstone is represent
ed in the border.
The inserts have boon increased in
number, and consist of a set of tinted
reproduced etchings by Pedro J.
Lemos. The books will be consider
ably larger than any previous volumes
and is to be bound in an unusually
rich and dignified cover.
