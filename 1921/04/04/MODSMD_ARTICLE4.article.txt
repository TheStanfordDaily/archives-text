### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Madame Frances Alda, vocally ar
tistic and charming personally, in her
concert in the Assembly Hall Friday
evening brougt to a 4 memorable close
the Healy concert scries for this season.
Her program, which was satisfying in
every respect, closcd a most enjoyable
and well selected group of recitals.
Alda has a thorough grasp of mu
sical style. Her voice is smooth and
even, and of great beauty and clear
ness. She sings with satisfying fervor
and added to this is the ability to bring
out all the dramatic intensity and shades
of coloring possible in her songs.
The program represented many dif
ferent typos of, compositions and
showed the singer at home in every
one. She has a certain poise, which
inspires in her audience confidence in
her ability. Her first group of songs
included Secchi's "Luigi del Caro Bene,"
which, with numbers by Purcell and
Veracini, and Handel's "Sleep, Why
Dost Thou Leave Me?" by Handel
formed an introduction to the vocal ca
pabilities of the artist.
A Swedish composition, two numbers
by Hue, "J' ai pleure en Reve," and "A
Des Oiseaux," and "Davnol May Drug,"
by Rachaninoff, were interesting for
their delightful melodies as well as for
clearness of expression and ease of
technique. Pucincini's beautiful "Un
Bel Di," aria from "Madame Butterfly,"
was one of the high lights in the eve
ning's program. Alda gave a most sat
isfying and dramatic interpretation of
the well known selection. It was fol
lowed by the delightful old negro mel
ody "The ol* ark's a-moverin'" by
Guinon.
The final numbers were a group of
songs in English and included "The Wa
ters of Minnetonka," two songs, "Char
ity," by Hagcman and "The Singer," by
Maxwell, both written for and dedi
cated to Alda, and admirably suited to
her voice. "The Singer," and "The
Waters of Minnetonka," received such
applause that they were both repeated.
Theodore Flint, who accompanied
Madame Alda, opened the program with
a Debussy Prologue, an intersting com
position in which he displayed individ
ual ability and artistic finish. His sec
ond group, "Romance," by Sibelius and
" March e Militaire," by Granados
showed feeling and technical mastery.
As an accompanist he was unfailingly
attentive to every shade of feeling in
the singer's voice.
