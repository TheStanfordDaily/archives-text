# JESS WELLS OUT OF CARD-BRUIN CLASH APRIL 16
## Star Hurdler Leaves College; Varsity Easily Wins Over Pomona College Tracksters 
### 
Jess Wells, varsity track star and
last year's captain, is out of the big
meet. Like a bolt of a clear sky this
news today climaxes the string of hard
luck that has seemed to haunt Coach
"Dink" Templeton and his varsity and
freshman track squad this season.
Wells, counted on to take both hurdle
events, and to place in the sprints against
California on April 16, has been forced
to leave college to take his father, who
was striken with paralysis in San Fran
cisco yesterday, to the Wells home in
Portland. Even should the outside
chance happen that Wells could get back
to Stanford in time for the big meet,
lie would not be in good shape to toe
the mark against the Bruin hurdlers.
The withdrawal of Wells from the
big meet apparently removes Stanford's
last chance to beat the best balanced
team California has had in years. Tem
pleton's team with the breaks of the
day, were granted by sport followers
to have a "fighting chance" for the
meet. Captain Morris Kirksey and
Flint Hanner now remain as the only
certain first men. However, Art Wil
cox should take the pole vault from
Norris, the best Bruin entry and Bob
Williams and Lane Ealk may finish one,
two in the hurdles, where the Bears
look weak on paper. That seems to
complete the roster of Card first places.
Saturday's meet against Pomona Col
lege, which Stanford easily won, gave
Templeton's men a good workout. A1
Carrey came forward as a big mefs
possibility, when ho brokv tho tape
the hundred and took second in the
furlong. Kenny Wright finished sev
eral yards aliead in the quarter in 51
