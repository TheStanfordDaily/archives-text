# Euphronia and Wranglers to Discuss Co-Education
## 
### 
The men of Euphronia Debating So
ciety and the women of Wranglers will
hold a joint discussion in room 12 of
the Law building next Thursday eve
ning at 7:30. The discussion will at
tempt to throw some new light on the
much-debated question of: "Should the
women he a part of Stanford or not."
Tn a spirit of ftin the women will tip
bold the arguments which world make
Stanford non-coeducational, while the
men w ; ll put up a vigorous protest of:
"No! We need them ere." It will not
take the form of a debate, but will be
more after the model of a parliamen
tary discussion. An invitation is ex
tended to all students and the public.
