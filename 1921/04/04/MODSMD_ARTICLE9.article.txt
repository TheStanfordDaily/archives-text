# FIVE RECORDS CUT IN YEARLING MEET; SUDDEN NICKS TWO
## Coach Templeton's Dope on Loss Holds Good; Bruin Cubs Gather In Fast Ball Game Too, 6-3 
### 
The annual freshman track meet with California Saturday resulted in a
94 ,1-4 to 36 1-4 victory for the Golden Cubs and the total destruction of
five yearling records. Individual honors are universally conceded to Eddie
Sudden of Stanford. Sudden left the other entries in the 100 and 220 yard
dashes comparatively floundering in his wake when he broke the tape with
the times of 10 seconds and 22 seconds respectively to his credit. This time
not only beat the field, but alll previous fields, the former records in these
events being 1-5 second higher in each case.
The other three new records went to California. Bowmaifs time of
2:01 1-5 in the 880 undershot the old time by 1 4-4 seconds. The two-mile
was won by Fisk of Berkeley in 10 minutes 7 4-5 seconds. This time pul-

verized the former record and the pace !
almost did the same for the rest of the '
fresh entrants. The fifth mark was <
set in the field. Harris of the Blue
and Gold heaving the javelin for the
distance of 158 feet 7 inches, a feat
which has never been done before by a 1
frosh in either university. 1
Most of the competition was among
the Bruin '24s for place and conse
quent numerals. The Cardinal babies '
usually finished with lots of room to 1
spare both before and behind. The high
hurdles relay and the 44() were the only
exceptions to this. Nichols and Welch
of the trans-bayers and Jansen of the
barm took the last high stick as a man
but dashed in in the order mentioned.
In the 440 the Stanfordites put over
the only exhibition of team work of
the meet. A blue jersey got the pole
followed by Scoficld of the Card jun
iors. With him two other white jer
seys ranged back in a very neat and ef
ficient box formation and right in the
middle of that box was Cal's best bet,
Pierce. He finally had to fall back to
get free and managed to do it by the
time the two-third mark had been
reached when he overtook Scofield with
his long stride. The pair passed the
other lead man and straightened out for
the sprint with Pierce leading a bit. He
had not been able to pile up a large
enough advantage, however, and Sco
field, in a beautiful spurt, just nosed
him out at the tape.
Thanks to Eddie Sudden again, the
relay added its five points to the "S"
side of the ledger. The race was go
ing fairly evenly when in the last lap
phy, of California, as first speaker of
the negative.
In the discussion which followed, at
tention was centered on the need of the
French for German indemnity as sub
sidiary to the German ability to pay.
Hildebrand's argument in his refuta
tion speech was largely confined to the
German psychology as related to this
argument.
Professor Raymond Garfield Gettell,
Amherst College, and author of texts
on political science, the Honorable M.
C. Sloss of the California Supreme
Court, and Seth Mann, San Francisco
attorney decided the extempore clas
sic. Professor E. A. Cottrell of the
political science department presided.
With the exception of the debate be
tween the California and Stanford
Freshmen, the Joffre closes the inter
collegiate schedule for the current quar
ter, according to Coach M. L. McClin
,tock, unless a last minute contest is ar
ranged within the next week or two.

94 ,1-4 to 36 1-4 victory for the Golden Cubs and the total destruction of
five yearling records. Individual honors are universally conceded to Eddie
Sudden of Stanford. Sudden left the other entries in the 100 and 220 yard
dashes comparatively floundering in his wake when he broke the tape with
the times of 10 seconds and 22 seconds respectively to his credit. This time
not only beat the field, but alll previous fields, the former records in these
events being 1-5 second higher in each case.
The other three new records went to California. Bowmaifs time of
2:01 1-5 in the 880 undershot the old time by 1 4-4 seconds. The two-mile
was won by Fisk of Berkeley in 10 minutes 7 4-5 seconds. This time pul-

verized the former record and the pace !
almost did the same for the rest of the '
fresh entrants. The fifth mark was <
set in the field. Harris of the Blue
and Gold heaving the javelin for the
distance of 158 feet 7 inches, a feat
which has never been done before by a 1
frosh in either university. 1
Most of the competition was among
the Bruin '24s for place and conse
quent numerals. The Cardinal babies '
usually finished with lots of room to 1
spare both before and behind. The high
hurdles relay and the 44() were the only
exceptions to this. Nichols and Welch
of the trans-bayers and Jansen of the
barm took the last high stick as a man
but dashed in in the order mentioned.
In the 440 the Stanfordites put over
the only exhibition of team work of
the meet. A blue jersey got the pole
followed by Scoficld of the Card jun
iors. With him two other white jer
seys ranged back in a very neat and ef
ficient box formation and right in the
middle of that box was Cal's best bet,
Pierce. He finally had to fall back to
get free and managed to do it by the
time the two-third mark had been
reached when he overtook Scofield with
his long stride. The pair passed the
other lead man and straightened out for
the sprint with Pierce leading a bit. He
had not been able to pile up a large
enough advantage, however, and Sco
field, in a beautiful spurt, just nosed
him out at the tape.
Thanks to Eddie Sudden again, the
relay added its five points to the "S"
side of the ledger. The race was go
ing fairly evenly when in the last lap
phy, of California, as first speaker of
the negative.
In the discussion which followed, at
tention was centered on the need of the
French for German indemnity as sub
sidiary to the German ability to pay.
Hildebrand's argument in his refuta
tion speech was largely confined to the
German psychology as related to this
argument.
Professor Raymond Garfield Gettell,
Amherst College, and author of texts
on political science, the Honorable M.
C. Sloss of the California Supreme
Court, and Seth Mann, San Francisco
attorney decided the extempore clas
sic. Professor E. A. Cottrell of the
political science department presided.
With the exception of the debate be
tween the California and Stanford
Freshmen, the Joffre closes the inter
collegiate schedule for the current quar
ter, according to Coach M. L. McClin
,tock, unless a last minute contest is ar
ranged within the next week or two.
