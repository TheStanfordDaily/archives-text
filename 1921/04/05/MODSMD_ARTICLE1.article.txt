### 
Coach Stay's men will meet Santa
Clara tomorrow afternoon on the Mis
sionites' diamond, the • game starting
promptly at 2:30. Nef will probnbly
take the mound for the Cardinal with
Haley and Kclley in reserve. Green is
in good shape again, after a siege with
a sore arm, hut he will be saved for
the game with California next Satur
day,

Draper may be in shape to work for a
few innings in the California game. An
infection in his hand which was op
erated on last week is doing as well as
could be expectcd, hut still keeps him
out of practice.

The Cardinal machine will work in
the same formation as the one used
against California last Saturday. Cap
tain Bundy will do the receiving and is
anxious to don the armor and get in
some good work to balance the wild
flunk which was so costly in the game
with the Blue and Gold.

Patterson is permanently fixed in his
berth at ihe first hassock and has been
delivering a brand of ball, which places
him among the first ranks of initial
sackers in college baseball on the coast.
Kallam worked in the keystone territory
in the last game and will pull them
down in the same position tomorrow.
He has been getting in some healthy
swats that have fattened his batting av
erage and incidentally helped haul in
the runs.
Maillot will probably take short with
"Lefty" Heckendorf in his old stamping
ground at third. Maillot was a little
weak on ground balls in the Saturday
game, but pulled down some high in
field flies and handled the stick con
sistently.
"Mort" Kline, the start of Saturday's
game, will cover the outer gardens
around center with Mitchell in left and
Carver in right.
With this line-up Coach Seay expects
to take an easy victory from the Mis
sionites, and put his men in a good
state of mind to go against the Blue
and Gold next Saturday.
