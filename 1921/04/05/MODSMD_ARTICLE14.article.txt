# "PYGMALION" CAST WILL BE COMPOSED OF MANY NOTABLES
## Professional Actors Will Be Seen on Stanford Stage Next Saturday Evening 
### 
The cast of "Pygmalion," which will
be given here Saturday will be com
posed almost entirely of professional
actois. Lillie H. !â€¢ isk, wlio will play
the role of Mrs. Pearce, is a niece of
the famous and beloved Mrs. Fisk. Ex -
cept for Richard Onions and Lloyd Car
rigan, the cast will be made up of pro
fessional actors living in Berkeley ami
taking part in the Greek theater pro
ductions.
Such productions as this, mark a new
epoch in the progress of the Little Thea
ter and community theater movements.
Much good work of this type has bcco
done by the progressive actors at Berke
ley.

The presentation of "Pygmalion" ai
Berkeley was perhaps the most success
ful production of the year there. The
scenery and general manner of produc
tion were elaborate and care folly car
ried out. According to critics the cast
was admirably selected and their act
ing was worthy of the extreme clever
ness with which Bernard Shaw has in
vested this, his most popular comedy.

"Pygmalion" was first produced in
Vienna and afterwards became a great
success at His Majesty's Theater in
London, where the leading parts were
taken by Mrs. Patrick Pampell and Sir
Herbert Beerbohn-Tree. , .

Irving Pitchell and Violette Wilson
will take the leads in the Berkeley pro
duction. The part of Eliza, the girl of
the streets, whom Pygmalion Higgins
tries to educate, is the most difficult part
to be played, and Violette Wilson has
done very well with it.

The seat drawing for the play will
be held tomorrow at 1 o'clock. As there
is a great demand for seats, from Palo
Alto jind San Jose, students are urged
to get seats at the drawings. The play
will be given in the Assembly Hall Sat
urday night at 8 o'clock.

Ambrose Whitmer's Syncopaters will
play between the acts and also at
the dance which will follow the play at
the Women's Clubhouse.
The cast includes several actors of
note throughout the West, Irving
Pitchel and Professor Sam Hume are
well known to audiences all along the
coast. The cast as it will appear here
is as follows:
