# THE
						YOUNG ALUMNI OF STANFORD
## 
### 
To a growing university an active, loyal alumni body is vital. Prob
lems of the past that normally would have been in part referred to
alumni in older institutions have been met in other ways at Stanford,
for the graduate group was young, and not yet grown to substantial
size and power.
To finance the new stadium the Board of Control has gone directly
to the Stanford alumni, and the public. The attitude of friends of the
University will depend much on the support of its graduates.
Stanford has been graduating men and women :for twenty-five
years. There is then a considerable body of former students who will
or will not answer the call of their university on the proposition of
building a stadium. If the Stanford spirit has remained with the men
who have left the Quad in the last twenty-five years, a proper stadium
for athletics should appeal to them as a mighty worthy project, coupled
as it is with the privilege of founding valuable scholarships which may
in a large way remedy the problem of tuition.
A hearty response to the letters of the Board of Control will show
that the alumni lxjdy is now of material power; otherwise probably we
must continue to believe that our alumni body is undeveloped and im
mature, and not to yet be reckoned as the substantial part of Stanford
that it is of every great university.
We realize of course that $100 contributions are not made easily by
the average man who has not reached the prime of life, and a successful
financing of the stadium will, indeed, indicate a sacrifice on the part of
the alumni for the good of their alma mater.

"DINK" TEMPLETON should not want for bleacher support on
the day of the California meet, regardless of how many more stars art
forced to leave college. Students often overlook the opportunity of
purchasing tickets to the big meet until too late to secure seats. Our
track bleachers will accommodate a limited number only, and Graduate
Manager Martin suggests that students may secure pasteboards today
and tomorrow at the administration building. Those who get them
now will not be vorrying over hard luck later.
