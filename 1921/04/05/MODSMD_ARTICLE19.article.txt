# PROFESSOR ALLARDICE IS ONE OF 'OLD GUARD'
## 
### 
Professor R. E. Allardice, head of
the Mathematics Department, is one
of the "Old Guard" who have worked
with the University for the last
thirty years. In speaking of the re
lations between student and instruc
tor, Professor Allardice says that it
all resolves itself into the simple task
of doing the daily routine in the best
manner possible. Some students are
naturally more free and open than
others. The ordinary turns of circum
stance give more opportunity for in
timate relations with one student than
with another. He is of the opinion
that during the first five years of the
Univorsity's existence, when the facul
ty were all young men, a more intim
ate feeling was enjoyed with the stu
dent than has ever been possible
since.
Professor Allardice Wfas born in
Edinjpurg, Scotland, in 1862, and was
educated in Daniel Stewart's College
and the University of Edinburgh, tak
ing the old classical course of Latin,
Greek, Mathematics, and Philosophy.
Starting at the age of twenty, as as
sistant, he taught in the University
of Edinburgh for ten years and there
met Professor Swain, first head of the
Mathematics Department at Stanford,
who asked him to come here. He ac
cepted the offer, beginning his work
in 1892. A few years later Professor
Swain left and Professor Allardice
became head of the department.
One notable incident of his life at
Edinburgh was the celebration of the
three hundredth anniversary of the
founding of the University, in 1885.
On this occasion Robert Browning
made the only public speech of his
life. Other noted men there at the
time were James Russell Lowell,
Helmholtz DeLesseps, builder of the
Suez canal, and Metchnikoff, great
est Russian chemist.
In 1902 Professor Allardice went to
Samoa with Dr. Jordan and Professor
Kellogg to collect fishes. There he
saw the home and tomb of Stevenson
and the fact that the great writer was
an Edinburgh man increased the in
terest for Professor Allardice. One
of the results of the trip was that the
smallest eel in existence was named
the "Allardice Eel," by Dr. Jordan.
Major Alexander Gordon Laing,
grand uncle of Professor Allardice,
was an African explorer and the first
white man to reach Timbuctoo. He
ivas killed there in 1827 while on a
government expedition and it is an
interesting incident that the remains
of his uniform were fount' by the
French about six years ago.
Professor Allardice has
unmarried and lives in a neat cot-.

tage with a red-tiled roof on the (
County Road just back of the Cam- i
pus. His life has not been tho pro- ]
verbial one of ease which is assigned (
to the bachelor, as his spare time has i
been taken up with writing numerous \
papers lor such journals as "The Pro- j
ceedings of the Royal Society of 1
Edinburgh," "Edinburgh Mathematics
Society," "Annals of Mathematics,"
and "Tho American Journal of Mathe
matics."
Golf is his favor to sport and on the
uiantel-pieca of his study are two
trophy cups, one of them the first
prize at Del Monte in 1907, and the
other as winner of the third flight at
the Del Monte tournameat o f 1917.
He doer not care for the movies and
maintains that it could be argued that
they do more harm than liquor ever
did. He places them on a plane with
ten-cent magazines and Sunday sup
plements, stupid at the best and abso
lutely demoralizing at the worst. De
sire for a vigorous and outdoor life
has been the, spur to many walking
trip.3 throughout the Black Forest of
Germany, Switzerland, Scotland, and
the Sierra Nevada. Before the war j
Professor Allardice visited Scotland
every other summer. His being a j
Scotchman and his close contact with .
Englion conditions have placed him j
fn u position to appreciate the English !
as well as the American viewpoint. i
He expressed regret concerning the
general misconception in America of
social and political conditions in Eng- ;
land. In his opinion the great dif- j
ference between English and American 1
politics is that over there the biggest i
men of the country make their life i
work while here the big men, as a I
whole, avoid the political life. it
gives one an entirely different con-j
ception of the Lords of England when ,
it is considered that these wealthy i
men could live idle lives of empty i
pleasures such as many of the wealthy
of America do, but they live hard and j
the records of nine out of ten of them ;
show exhaustive work along research :
of practical lines. He realizes that I
his views may be regarded as preju-'
diced and for that reason is not won' |
to express them unrestrainedly.
Professor Allardice, as one of the!
"Old Guard." lias always taken a keen ;
interest in the development and af- j'
fairs of the University. Until recent |
years he was an active sport enthusl- j
ast, missing few games throughout the
season and says in regard to his with
drawal from active participation:
"The students may wonder why the
faculty do not take more of an inter
est in athletics, but it is only natural
that after many years the inclination i
is to drop out of the running."

Professor Allardice, as one of the!
"Old Guard." lias always taken a keen ;
interest in the development and af- j'
fairs of the University. Until recent |
years he was an active sport enthusl- j
ast, missing few games throughout the
season and says in regard to his with
drawal from active participation:
"The students may wonder why the
faculty do not take more of an inter
est in athletics, but it is only natural
that after many years the inclination i
is to drop out of the running."
Professor R. E. Allardice, head of
the Mathematics Department, is one
of the "Old Guard" who have worked
with the University for the last
thirty years. In speaking of the re
lations between student and instruc
tor, Professor Allardice says that it
all resolves itself into the simple task
of doing the daily routine in the best
manner possible. Some students are
naturally more free and open than
others. The ordinary turns of circum
stance give more opportunity for in
timate relations with one student than
with another. He is of the opinion
that during the first five years of the
Univorsity's existence, when the facul
ty were all young men, a more intim
ate feeling was enjoyed with the stu
dent than has ever been possible
since.
Professor Allardice Wfas born in
Edinjpurg, Scotland, in 1862, and was
educated in Daniel Stewart's College
and the University of Edinburgh, tak
ing the old classical course of Latin,
Greek, Mathematics, and Philosophy.
Starting at the age of twenty, as as
sistant, he taught in the University
of Edinburgh for ten years and there
met Professor Swain, first head of the
Mathematics Department at Stanford,
who asked him to come here. He ac
cepted the offer, beginning his work
in 1892. A few years later Professor
Swain left and Professor Allardice
became head of the department.
One notable incident of his life at
Edinburgh was the celebration of the
three hundredth anniversary of the
founding of the University, in 1885.
On this occasion Robert Browning
made the only public speech of his
life. Other noted men there at the
time were James Russell Lowell,
Helmholtz DeLesseps, builder of the
Suez canal, and Metchnikoff, great
est Russian chemist.
In 1902 Professor Allardice went to
Samoa with Dr. Jordan and Professor
Kellogg to collect fishes. There he
saw the home and tomb of Stevenson
and the fact that the great writer was
an Edinburgh man increased the in
terest for Professor Allardice. One
of the results of the trip was that the
smallest eel in existence was named
the "Allardice Eel," by Dr. Jordan.
Major Alexander Gordon Laing,
grand uncle of Professor Allardice,
was an African explorer and the first
white man to reach Timbuctoo. He
ivas killed there in 1827 while on a
government expedition and it is an
interesting incident that the remains
of his uniform were fount' by the
French about six years ago.
Professor Allardice has
unmarried and lives in a neat cot-.

tage with a red-tiled roof on the (
County Road just back of the Cam- i
pus. His life has not been tho pro- ]
verbial one of ease which is assigned (
to the bachelor, as his spare time has i
been taken up with writing numerous \
papers lor such journals as "The Pro- j
ceedings of the Royal Society of 1
Edinburgh," "Edinburgh Mathematics
Society," "Annals of Mathematics,"
and "Tho American Journal of Mathe
matics."
Golf is his favor to sport and on the
uiantel-pieca of his study are two
trophy cups, one of them the first
prize at Del Monte in 1907, and the
other as winner of the third flight at
the Del Monte tournameat o f 1917.
He doer not care for the movies and
maintains that it could be argued that
they do more harm than liquor ever
did. He places them on a plane with
ten-cent magazines and Sunday sup
plements, stupid at the best and abso
lutely demoralizing at the worst. De
sire for a vigorous and outdoor life
has been the, spur to many walking
trip.3 throughout the Black Forest of
Germany, Switzerland, Scotland, and
the Sierra Nevada. Before the war j
Professor Allardice visited Scotland
every other summer. His being a j
Scotchman and his close contact with .
Englion conditions have placed him j
fn u position to appreciate the English !
as well as the American viewpoint. i
He expressed regret concerning the
general misconception in America of
social and political conditions in Eng- ;
land. In his opinion the great dif- j
ference between English and American 1
politics is that over there the biggest i
men of the country make their life i
work while here the big men, as a I
whole, avoid the political life. it
gives one an entirely different con-j
ception of the Lords of England when ,
it is considered that these wealthy i
men could live idle lives of empty i
pleasures such as many of the wealthy
of America do, but they live hard and j

Professor Allardice, as one of the!
"Old Guard." lias always taken a keen ;
interest in the development and af- j'
fairs of the University. Until recent |
years he was an active sport enthusl- j
ast, missing few games throughout the
season and says in regard to his with
drawal from active participation:
"The students may wonder why the
faculty do not take more of an inter
est in athletics, but it is only natural
that after many years the inclination i
is to drop out of the running."
Professor R. E. Allardice, head of
the Mathematics Department, is one
of the "Old Guard" who have worked
with the University for the last
thirty years. In speaking of the re
lations between student and instruc
tor, Professor Allardice says that it
all resolves itself into the simple task
of doing the daily routine in the best
manner possible. Some students are
naturally more free and open than
others. The ordinary turns of circum
stance give more opportunity for in
timate relations with one student than
with another. He is of the opinion
that during the first five years of the
Univorsity's existence, when the facul
ty were all young men, a more intim
ate feeling was enjoyed with the stu
dent than has ever been possible
since.
Professor Allardice Wfas born in
Edinjpurg, Scotland, in 1862, and was
educated in Daniel Stewart's College
and the University of Edinburgh, tak
ing the old classical course of Latin,
Greek, Mathematics, and Philosophy.
Starting at the age of twenty, as as
sistant, he taught in the University
of Edinburgh for ten years and there
met Professor Swain, first head of the
Mathematics Department at Stanford,
who asked him to come here. He ac
cepted the offer, beginning his work
in 1892. A few years later Professor
Swain left and Professor Allardice
became head of the department.
One notable incident of his life at
Edinburgh was the celebration of the
three hundredth anniversary of the
founding of the University, in 1885.
On this occasion Robert Browning
made the only public speech of his
life. Other noted men there at the
time were James Russell Lowell,
Helmholtz DeLesseps, builder of the
Suez canal, and Metchnikoff, great
est Russian chemist.
In 1902 Professor Allardice went to
Samoa with Dr. Jordan and Professor
Kellogg to collect fishes. There he
saw the home and tomb of Stevenson
and the fact that the great writer was
an Edinburgh man increased the in
terest for Professor Allardice. One
of the results of the trip was that the
smallest eel in existence was named
the "Allardice Eel," by Dr. Jordan.
Major Alexander Gordon Laing,
grand uncle of Professor Allardice,
was an African explorer and the first
white man to reach Timbuctoo. He
ivas killed there in 1827 while on a
government expedition and it is an
interesting incident that the remains
of his uniform were fount' by the
French about six years ago.
Professor Allardice has
unmarried and lives in a neat cot-.

tage with a red-tiled roof on the (
County Road just back of the Cam- i
pus. His life has not been tho pro- ]
verbial one of ease which is assigned (
to the bachelor, as his spare time has i
been taken up with writing numerous \
papers lor such journals as "The Pro- j
ceedings of the Royal Society of 1
Edinburgh," "Edinburgh Mathematics
Society," "Annals of Mathematics,"
and "Tho American Journal of Mathe
matics."
Golf is his favor to sport and on the
uiantel-pieca of his study are two
trophy cups, one of them the first
prize at Del Monte in 1907, and the
other as winner of the third flight at
the Del Monte tournameat o f 1917.
He doer not care for the movies and
maintains that it could be argued that
they do more harm than liquor ever
did. He places them on a plane with
ten-cent magazines and Sunday sup
plements, stupid at the best and abso
lutely demoralizing at the worst. De
sire for a vigorous and outdoor life
has been the, spur to many walking
trip.3 throughout the Black Forest of
Germany, Switzerland, Scotland, and
the Sierra Nevada. Before the war j
Professor Allardice visited Scotland
every other summer. His being a j
Scotchman and his close contact with .
Englion conditions have placed him j
fn u position to appreciate the English !
as well as the American viewpoint. i
