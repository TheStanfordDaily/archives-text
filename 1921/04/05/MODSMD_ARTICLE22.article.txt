### 
5 The 1922 Quad will embody a great
? many features that set it apart from
>) other annuals that have appeared in
|) recent years. Especially will this lie
seen in the art work. A corps of the
y best of the campus artists have been
y wording since the beginning of the
school year last fall under the direction
< of Janice Dunker, '22, the art editor of
0 the book.
?) Margaret Polhamus, '21, is responsi
£ hie for the design appearing on the
<) cover of the book, and as well has drawn
j several full page drawings. Edward M.
> Farmer, '23, has given life to the Quad
; in his four drawings of the front sec
'< tion. This memorial page will stand
£ out as the best individual piece of art
1 work that has appeared in any Quad.
; Throughout the book the aim has been
' to make the art work pleasing and of a
; uniform nature. An example of this is
* found in the uniform style of printing
» that has been adopted for all the art
, work.
[ Mr. Lemos was persuaded to etch
■ the university buildings for the Quad,
: and for the first* time Stanford will
( be seen in etchings; the book contain
i ing six tinted reproduced etchings. This,
! too, is new to Stanford annals.
; Another new feature of the book is
; that every page will contain live read
| ing matter. Statistics which arc im
! portant as record, but not as reading
' matter have been condensed in a scpa
" rate section at the close of the book,
| which is easily accessable by means of
1 a complete index at the close of the
, annual.
| Athletics have been given more space
than ever before, the section being un
, der the direction of Harry Borba, '22,
• and Shelley Pierce, '22. Every impor
tant athletic event of the year will be
written up in an interesting way and
will be illustrated by an abundance of
photographic material.
The book this year will contain nearly
600 pages, which is larger than last
year's publication. An especially large
Razz section will be featured in car
toon form drawn by the best of the
campus caricaturists.
The Quad is on sale at Engineering
corner, and will remain on sale until
