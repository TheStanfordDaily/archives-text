# SANTA CLARA WILL WITHDRAW FROM ALL SPORT COMPETITION
## 
### 
Coming as a complete surprise, the
discontinuance of all inter-collcgiate
athletic competition was announced yes
terday by James O'Connor, graduate
manager of athletics at Santa Clara. No
reason was assigned for the withdrawal,
the statement merely being given out
that it was in line with the new policy
adopted with reference to athletics.
All games which have been scheduled
for next year with other universities,
among them being the annual football
game with Stanford, have been can
celled. O'Connor and Father Sullivan,
athletic moderator, refused to state
whether the retirement would be tem
porary or permanent, both referring the
matter to Father Murphy, the president,
who is at present out of town.
It is thought by many that the lack J
of good athletic materia! at the school, â– 
coupled with the adverse outcomes of ;
many of the contests, had much to do j
with the action. Needles, captain of!
the football team, will not be back next
year, and likewise Caeser Manelli, even
if he does return, would probably be
ineligible. Coach Bob Harmon is to
enter a law firm in Chicago next sum
mer. and his successor would have had j
to been found.
