ciety, group, or individual to express
an opinion on either side of the con
troversy now before Executive Com
mittee, relating to the validity of the

ment it was necessary to have a two
thirds majority of the total vote cast
at the election, rather than two-thirds
of the votes cast for amendment.

ance of the appeal submitted a brief
to Dean Huston of the Law School.

Any other interested parties may
submit briefs on either side of the
question, and Dean Huston -will con
duet a hearing in the latter part of
