# COACH POWELL BACK FROM MEETING OF RULES COMMITTEE
## First Western Representative Returns to Take Charge of Spring Football Practice 
### 
Coach Walter Powell, who left here
March 8 to attend the meeting of the
Rules Committee governing inter-col
legiate football, arrived on the campus
yesterday morning.
Coach Powell arrived for the opening
meeting, which was held in the Bilt
more Hotel, in New York, on March
11. During the meeting a number of
sub-committees were formed. These

sub-committees were in cession for some
time, and they suggested many changes.
TEic large change which was made from
their reports was in the rule governing
a touch-back. Formerly after a touch
back the ball was put into play on the
20 yard line, now by the new change
made by the committee the ball is put
into play on the 30-yard line. Other
things such as restricting the forward
pass and changing the present method
of goal kicking were discussed, but
were left as they stand at present. The
other work of the committee was the
interpretation and the rewording of
some of the rules, which have caused
dispute between different colleges.

Another change, which was not mnde
in the rules, themselves, but which af
fects the representatives on the na
tional committee was made. Formally
men represented certain sections. The
sections were indefinite areas which
were in a loose way connected with the
representative from that section. Now,
due to the efforts of Major Daley of
West Point and Coach Powell, the
United States are divided up into def
inite areas. These areas have a local
conference and they discuss the things
which they want incorporated in the
rules. These conferences are presided
over by the national representative of
the district, who takes the opinion of
the district to the national committee. Tn
our district Coach Powell is the national
representative, and he will be the one
who will take the opinions of our dis
trict to the national committee.
