venge on Palo Alto High Schools nine
for the defeat suffered at their hands
at the beginning of the season by plas
tering them with whitewash, 4-0, yes
terday afternoon on the local diamond.
Coach Righter's men showed up well,
although of course, after the hard game
of last Saturday, perfect baseball could
not be expected.
A1 Loewenstein, pitching for the
babes, gave Palo Alto about as much
chance as the well-known paraffin dog
on the equator. Only two hits were
garnered off his delivery, and he had
the game well in hand at all times. Al
most perfect support was given him in
the field.
The teair. as a whole showed a good
brand of baseball. No one of the nine
stood out, except that Capt. Woodward
played his usual good game both in the
infield and at bat. The hits vftre
pretty well scattered along the line-up.

Thrs game differed from the last one
with Palo Alto in that not so mnry
substitutions were made. Earlier in the

season every one was given a chance
to show what lie had, but by now the
plavers and their places have been pretty
well located and not miwh shifting is
necissary. Substitutions made ve;te--
day were: S. Hawkins for Deffen
b eh at secoi.d; Chandler for Colviu in
. ight field: Hropcr for Cole ; n left
iir!d.
A cold wind made it difficult to play.
Considering the weather condition-" the
game was as good as could be expected.
Only seven innings were played.
