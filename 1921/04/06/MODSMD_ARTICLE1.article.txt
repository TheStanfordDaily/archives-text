# LAST PENINSULA CONCERT ARTISTS WELL RECEIVED

### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Madame Matzenauer, Charles
Carver and La Forge Give
Varied Recited on Campus

Madame Margaret Matzenauer, as
sißted by Charles Carver, basso, and
Frank La Forge, composer-pianist,
presented an ideally chosen and care
fully arranged program in the last
Peninsula Musical Association con
cert. which was given in the Assembly
Hall last evening.
The numbers were unusually well
selected, affording the audience op
portunity for an appreciation of the
varied gifts of the artists. In ad
dition, the compositions themselves
presented an ensemble of well-loved
masterpieces, as well as newer and
less familiar compositions. The pro
gram ranged from Mozart and Handel
down to MacDowell, even including
three compositions by La Forge. It
contained favorite operatic selections,
arias from "Samson and Delilah" and
"Le Prophete" being among the more
substantial numbers, while Schuman's
"Spring Night," Bishop's "Love Has
Byes," and a number of the encores,
including "Kitty of Coleraine" and
"Cadenitas de Granada" were among
the lighter compositions which gave
to the program completeness and per
fect balance.
Margaret Matzenauer has a full,
rich contralto voice, capable of im
pressive crescendos and delicate light
ness. She sings with genuine feeling,
heightened by a dramatic sense and
the power of visualizing the song she
chooses to convey. Her singing repre
sents perfection of technical skill com
bined with artistic understanding, and
added to this is a gracious and con
vincing personality which sustains
interest throughout her recital.
No better introduction could have
been chosen than Gluck's beautiful
*'0 de mio dolce ardor," her first num
ber. Schubert's vigorous "Erlkiug"
of the first group was a test of the
artist's technical control. Madame
Matzenauer also sang "Supplication,"
and "Nocturne," two songs dedicated
to her by La Forge. "The Waters of
Minnetonka," by Lieurance, was one of
her most enthusiastically received en
cores. Debussy's "Mandoline" and the
"Barcarolle" from Offenbach's "Tales
of Hoffman," sung with Mr. Carver,
were particularly appealing and met
with such insistent applause that they
were both repeated.
Two of the most interesting num
bers were the "Qui sdegno" aria from
Mosart's "Magic Flute" and Handel's
"O Sleep, why dost thou leave me?"
sung by Mr. Carver. He displayed a
voice firm and effective in tone, and
unusually even throughout a wide
range. He gained an immediate hold
on the audience, his interpretation of
Scarlotti's "Gia il sole dal Gange,"
sung recently by Charles ,Hackett,
bc'ng especially well received.
Besides his careful accompaniments,
Frank La Forge played two solo num
bers, "Romance" his original compo
sition, and MacDowell's "Etude de
Concert." His playing was character
ized by fine tone and clear technique,
his interpretation being so effective
that he was recalled twice for en
cores.

Ticket sale for the Stanford-
California Meet has been
extended to tomorrow, according
to the announcement made today
by Graduate Manager Martin.

ness. She sings with genuine feeling,
heightened by a dramatic sense and
the power of visualizing the song she
chooses to convey. Her singing repre
sents perfection of technical skill com
bined with artistic understanding, and
added to this is a gracious and con
vincing personality which sustains
interest throughout her recital.
No better introduction could have
been chosen than Gluck's beautiful
*'0 de mio dolce ardor," her first num
ber. Schubert's vigorous "Erlkiug"
of the first group was a test of the
artist's technical control. Madame
Matzenauer also sang "Supplication,"
and "Nocturne," two songs dedicated
to her by La Forge. "The Waters of
Minnetonka," by Lieurance, was one of
her most enthusiastically received en
cores. Debussy's "Mandoline" and the
"Barcarolle" from Offenbach's "Tales
of Hoffman," sung with Mr. Carver,
were particularly appealing and met
with such insistent applause that they
were both repeated.
Two of the most interesting num
bers were the "Qui sdegno" aria from
Mosart's "Magic Flute" and Handel's
"O Sleep, why dost thou leave me?"
sung by Mr. Carver. He displayed a
voice firm and effective in tone, and
unusually even throughout a wide
range. He gained an immediate hold
on the audience, his interpretation of
Scarlotti's "Gia il sole dal Gange,"
sung recently by Charles ,Hackett,
bc'ng especially well received.
Besides his careful accompaniments,
Frank La Forge played two solo num
bers, "Romance" his original compo
sition, and MacDowell's "Etude de
Concert." His playing was character
ized by fine tone and clear technique,
his interpretation being so effective
that he was recalled twice for en
cores.

Madame Matzenauer, Charles
Carver and La Forge Give
Varied Recited on Campus

Madame Margaret Matzenauer, as
sißted by Charles Carver, basso, and
Frank La Forge, composer-pianist,
presented an ideally chosen and care
fully arranged program in the last
Peninsula Musical Association con
cert. which was given in the Assembly
Hall last evening.
The numbers were unusually well
selected, affording the audience op
portunity for an appreciation of the
varied gifts of the artists. In ad
dition, the compositions themselves
presented an ensemble of well-loved
masterpieces, as well as newer and
less familiar compositions. The pro
gram ranged from Mozart and Handel
down to MacDowell, even including
three compositions by La Forge. It
contained favorite operatic selections,
arias from "Samson and Delilah" and
"Le Prophete" being among the more
substantial numbers, while Schuman's
"Spring Night," Bishop's "Love Has
Byes," and a number of the encores,
including "Kitty of Coleraine" and
"Cadenitas de Granada" were among
the lighter compositions which gave
to the program completeness and per
fect balance.
Margaret Matzenauer has a full,
rich contralto voice, capable of im
pressive crescendos and delicate light
ness. She sings with genuine feeling,
heightened by a dramatic sense and
the power of visualizing the song she
chooses to convey. Her singing repre
sents perfection of technical skill com
bined with artistic understanding, and
