# FRESHMAN NINE PLAY PRACTICE GAME TO KEEP IN CONDITION
## 
### 
The freshman nine, instead of the
regiflar practice yesterday afternoon
played a few innings of a practice
game with the varsity. Frye was given
a chance at the mound. The line-up
of the team has been pretty well
fixed by now, and although some
changes may occur, it is not likely
that Righter will make sudden rear
rangement. Fuller was behind the
plate yesterday. Holmes, who caught
last quarter, is getting over his sprain
ed ankle and was out yesterday.
This afternoon the freshmen are
playing Lowell High School in another
practice game, preparatory to the
second game of the series with the
California freshmen which comes off
here Saturday. Righter has been giv
his men as. many chances at games
as possible, and by Saturday the team
should be in good shape to meet Cali
fornia freshmen.
