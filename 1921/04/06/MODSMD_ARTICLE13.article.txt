# DELTA CHI WINS IN INTRAMURAL GAME WITH S. A. E. NINE
## 
### 
Tn what appeared to be largely a
pitcher's battle, the Delta Chi and Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon nines tangled yester
day afternoon in the first contcst in
League Three, with the result of a 12 5
victory for the former.
The game was characterized by a scar
city of hits, most of the tallies being
the result of errors and bases' on balls.
A rather elusive, but at the same time
a frequently ill-placed pellet was cast by
both pitchers. Reticker for the Delta
Chi's sent 10 men to bench on strike
outs. The S. A. E pitcher, Bryan, al
most equalled this record by fanning
six of the legal ball artists.
Coplen, Reticker and Tritle starred
for the Delta Chi's, while luminous
among .the S. A. E's were Bryan, Keller
and Graham.
