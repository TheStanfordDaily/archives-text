# FRESHMAN DEBATING TEAMS TO RECEIVE PINS
## 
### 
Debating pins are to be awarded to
the freshmen making the forensic
teams in the Stanford-California fresh
man debate, and the freshman-sopho
more debate. A committee has been
appointed to choose the design of the
pins.
Programs of the Stanford-California
freshman debate are to be sent to
every freshman on the campus, an
nounced Debate Manager W. R. Gage
today. This debate is the first of its
kind to be held, and it is hoped that
a precedent will be established, and
another form of competition between
the two univerities will result.
