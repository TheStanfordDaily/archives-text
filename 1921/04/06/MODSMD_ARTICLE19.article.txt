# NO ROOTING SECTION
## 
### 
Can any one imagine a rooting section of less than two hundred at
the California-Stanford track meet next week? .Scarcely more than a
hundred pasteboards had been placed in students' hands when the track
manager closed the booth in the Administration building yesterday.
This certainly cannot be due to a lack of interest in the annual
battle with the Blue and Gold, but to lack of knowledge on the part of
students that rooters' seats must be purchased now. Graduate Manager
Martin, believing the publicity given the ticket sale insufficient, has ex
tended the time for purchasing rooters' tickets until tomorrow at 4:00
p. m. The rooting section at that time should be a real one.
