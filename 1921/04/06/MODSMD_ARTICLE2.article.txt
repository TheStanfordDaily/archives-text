# MARIE HUTTON AND MURPHY NOW LEAD
## Surprise In Carnival King Contest Comes When Boxer Jumps to Front With 2540 
### 
Joe Murphy sprung a surprise on the
Carnival King fans today at the last
minute before press time today, aild
came to the front in the race for royal
honors. At noon, Joe Phillips was
leading, with Jim Wallace Second.
Shortly after 1 o'clock bunched votes
for Murphy and Marie Hutton came in
and put them at the head of the lists
and far in the lead of the other can
didates. Murphy has been down
among the lower enders in the race
for the scepter, but the sudden boost
this afternoon puts him way to the
fore. It is rumored that "Joe" was
entirely unaware of his friends' efforts
in his behalf but that he is taking the
matter calmly and will not cause any
violence. No statement has been made
by the recently leading men.
Marie Hutton also came out from
behind to take her place among the
stellar constellation. This sudden up
setting of the dope on the race changes j
all the suppositions on the
but those who claim to know say that j
there will be intense competition to-1
morrow over the final race-for the !n-
Bide track before the cut comes in
the candidates.
