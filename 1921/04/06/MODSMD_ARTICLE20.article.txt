In these days of Spanish carnivals demanding the presence of "his"
and "her majesty" the King and Queen, we hear much of kingly quali
fications ranging from the humble and demure to the haughty and
mighty. argue well that a monarch must be an experienced lounge
lizard, while others stand for the type of the cauliflower ear.
One thing is certain. A good-fellow king is necessary to the real
carnival spirit, whether he be athletic or flat footed, handsome or like the
rest of us. Similar qualifications hold for the queen, though it is gen
erally conceded she must be fair to look upon.
Th ere is a great deal to be gained from a king and queen contest
of the right sort. If all parties <*nter the ballot competition with the idea
of tendering the robes of royalty to persons whose presence will add
merriment to the carnival atmosphere, victory will offer the presiding
privilege to two well-liked students who will head the carnival ceremo
nies in a true mardi gras spirit that we all enjoy.
The king and queen contest should consist of much fun and good
feeling, everything to be taken in the spirit of carnival revelry; and of
cotirse no lives are lost by parties who may not win.
