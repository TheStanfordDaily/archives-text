# Premier Ace Will Fly From City to Campus
## 
### 
Eddie Rickenbacher, America's "ace
of aces," is to fly from San Francisco
to the campus in the plane in which he
recently established the Los Angeles-
San Francisco record on Wednesday,
April 13. He has consented to speak
before the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce on that date and instead of re
sorting to the usual steam transporta
tion, he will rely upon his own air
plane to conduct him to his destination.
While Rickenbacher is engaged in talk
ing to the business men of Palo Alto,
arrangements have been made with
Major Collins to have his plane guarded
by members of the local R. O. T. C.
