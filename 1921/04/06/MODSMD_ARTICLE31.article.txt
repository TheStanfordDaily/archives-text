# COMPLETE COURSE IN LAW WILL BE GIVEN IN SUMMER QUARTER
## Regular Department Faculty Will Be Increased During Both Halves of Session 
### 
Stanford University will give courses
in the Law School during the summer
quarter, meeting the requirements of
men all the way from those just begin
ning their professional studies to prac
ticing attorneys, who wish to do spe
cial work in particular fields.
I"or these latter and for advanced
students many courses will be offered
by a faculty composed, in addition to
regular members of the Stanford law
department, of brilliant scholars and
experienced practitioners gathered from
law schools and offices in all parts of
the country.
All the foundation courses, for stu
dents just taking up their professional
work, will be offered by men of the
regular Stanford Faculty in order that
the beginners may receive training in
these ground work courses that will pre
pare them to carry on the more ad
vanced courses satisfactorily in the
Stanford Department. A full program
of these foundation courses has been
arranged so that the student beginning
his law school work this summer may
save a full quarter's time in gaining his
professional degree. By taking this
summer quarter work the student will
not only be fitted to begin practice
earlier, but in most cases he will save
money, as well, in the long run, on ac
count of the difference in the amount
he can earn in the usual temporary
summer employments and that of even
the beginner in law practice.
The men who will be on the Stanford
law school faculty this summer outside
the regular staff of the school are:
William Green Hale, Dean of the Law
School of the University of Oregon;
Frederick Green, of the University of
Illinois Law School; George Edwin Os
borne of the University of West Vir
ginia Law School; Landis Bevis, a
practicing attorney in Cincinnati; and
Bryant Smith, of the University of
Colorado Law School.
The summer quarter work is divided
into two halves, the first running from
June 21 to July 27, and the second from
July 28 to September 3. The courses in
each half are complete, so that a stu
dent who can attend the University only
half the quarter, as might be the case
with practicing attorneys, may finish a
full course. Students who are in resi
dence through the whole quarter will
be offered work equal to that of any
other quarter in the year, either wholly
in law or with some other subjects.
The summer quarter law courses, are
precisely equivalent in quality, content,
and credit value to those of other quar
ters.
Dean Hale, of the University of Ore
gon Law School, will offer the spe
cial procedural course of the summer
quarter, dealing with the subject of evi
dence, on which he has written exten
sively. The course, developing such
topics as the court and jury, the bur
den of proof, and the "parole evidence
rule," will be particularly useful to
practicing attorneys. Dean Hale, him
self, has had extensive practice.
Professor Green in his course on bail
ments and carriers will use the case
book on carriers written by him, which
is the standard book on this subject.
Professor Osborne will give a course
on Mortgages; Dr. Bevis one on In
surance; Professor Smith one on Dam
ages, and also one on Marriage and
Divorce.
The Law School Faculty for the first
half of the quarter will consist of Pro
fessors Cathcart, Kirkwood, Green, and
Osborne, and for the second half of
Professors Hale, Owens, and Smith.
Professors Hale, Green, Osborne and
Bevis are all Harvard Law School
graduates and had brilliant careers in
that institution.
Smith, who is a graduate of the Col
orado Law School, is a man of striking
scholarly ability, having been at the
head of his class in high school, college,
and professional school.
Th courses especially designed for
beginners in the study of law, though
they arc open to others who have not
had them, arc as follows:
In the first half of the quarter, Pro
fessor A. M. Cathcart will give a course
in Torts, dealing with such fundamen
tal topics as negligence and legal cause,
and Professor M. R. Kirkwood will
offer an introduction to real property,
developing historically the doctrine of
legal interests in land so as to show the
modern law of property in land, includ
ing community property. In the sec
ond half of the quarter, Professor W.
B. Owens will give a course in per
sonal property, dealing similarly with
"possessory interests," including such
topics as the rights of finders, the law
of pledges and of conversion.
Dean C. A. Huston, of the Stanford
Law School, will teach in the Univer
sity of Chicago during the summer.
