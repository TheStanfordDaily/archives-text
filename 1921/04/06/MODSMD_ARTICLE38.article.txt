# PROFESSOR GRAY REVIEWS 'PYGMALION'
## 
### Professor H. D. Gray 
The Renaissance Club must have a
sense of humor. Bernard Shaw is the
most modern of the moderns, and
"Pygmalion" iB one of his rather
"ultra" plays. One wonders at first
why a club whose mission is to ex
ploit the past should sponsor the fu
turistic present. But "Pygmalion"
itself is a symbol of the Renaissance.
As the Middle Ages suddenly had the
culture and refinement of classical
learning suddenly dumped down upon
them, fascinating and bewildering
them until they gave up being the
Middle Ages and became the Renais
sance in self-defense, so Liza, the
heroine of Shaw's "Pygmalion," a
girl more ignorant than the Middle
Ages ever htough of being, suddenly
finds herself thrust into the brilliancy
and glitter of modern society, to be
transformed by it into a different aort
of being from what she was before.
The question is, will she stay put?
"Will she, grow from her Middle Ages
childhood into a Renaissance young
womanhood? Or will she drop dack
into what she was before as soon as
the special conditions are removed?
Take' any girl of the cheap, slangy
gum-chewing variety who works in a
factory or big office building in the
wholesale region, and who gets no so
cial outlook beyond the movies and
occasional river-boat, excursions, dress
her up till Madame Matzenajier would
look at her with envy, but her in a
ball room with society's elect meeting
her under the impression that she is
the ext.emely distinguished Somebody
from Somewhere —and what is going to
happen? Could she be trained in six
months' time to "get away with it?"
And suppose somebody falls in love
with this social antomaton??
Higgins, the professor of phonetics
who undertakes Lize's transformation,
thinks she is bound to revert to type
—that he is the glabanic battery and
she will only keep going while the
current is on. Freddy thinks she
otherwise. What do you think?
"Pygmalion" is one of Shaw's most
brilliant comedies. It is full of genu
ine laughs, and a shrewd philosophy
of life underneath for those who have
wit enough to see it.
