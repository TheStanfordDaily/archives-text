# FRESHMAN NINES MEET IN SECOND BOUT TOMORROW
## Stanford Team Handicapped by Injured men; Fuller is Out With Broken Thumb 
### 
Ihe second game of the freshman
Stanford-California baseball series will
be played on the local diamond tomor
row at 3 :30. The game was originally
planned for Saturday, but has been
changed to Friday afternoon. To have
a chance to win the series, Coach Right
er's men must capture tomorrow's con
test, af> they lost the first game last
Saturday.
Just how good that chance of win
ning is, seems to be a matter of doubt.
A team already crippled by the loss
of some of its best players was still
further handicapped when a foul tip
crashed into Frank Fuller's thumb yes
terday afternoon in the fifth inning of
the game with Lowell High, and snap
ped the bone in two. Fuller has been
catching a good game, and with him
out of the game with a broken thumb,
the receiving end of the battery is left
in a rather precarious position. Bill
Holmes finished the game yesterday,
and will start the game tomorrow un
less Righter can uncover by some mira
cle a good catcher, who is not crippled
Holmes is one of the best catchers the
freshman nine has had, but he is just
getting over a sprained ankle ,and is
naturally not in the best of shape.
Who will start tomorrow's contest on
the slab has not yet been divulged. Bon
ner, who hurled the last California
game, started yesterday's contest, but
quit after the first inning to. give his
arm a rest. Mertz has been showing
good pitching against the teams has
met so far, and held Lowell well in
hand yesterday in the six innings he
pitched. Lowenstein is another possi
bility. Whoever the pitcher is, if the
team gives the perfect support it is
capable of giving, chances to win are
good.
The infield is well established, and
has been playing a good brand of ball.
Strong, at first has shown himself to
be quite capable of handling that posi
tion suitably, and Captain Woodward at
shortstop has been covering a lot of
ground besides batting well. Smurr at
third has a good peg that converts many
hard-hit balls into outs. Second ; base
will be taken care of by Deffenbach, a
consistant fielder.
The outfield is by no means so well
determined. Reese, who came out at the
beginning of this quarter, has shown
himself to be a hitter who hits when
hits are needed. Giandler played left
field last Saturday and Coulter played
against Lowell yesterday. There are
other outfielders who are about as
good, and Righter is likely to give any
of them a chance if the occasion de
mands.
