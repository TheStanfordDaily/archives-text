# ELEVEN ADVANCED STUDENTS RECEIVE 1921 FELLOWSHIPS
## Appointments Provide $750 for Research Work to Be Carried on In University 
### 
Eleven advanced students have re
ceived appointments to the Univecsity
Fellowships at Stanford for the next
college year.
These University Fellowships carry
an annual stipend of $750 each, and are
awarded for the purpose of fostering

versity. The number of these fellow
ships is ordinarily seven, but four of
the students appointed last year later
accepted teaching positions, which left
the fellowships vacant, and these fel
lowships, since the college year was
well under way, were held over for
next year.
Miss Frances E. Willis, who receives
one of the fellowships, is this year one
of the four Stanford graduates, who
