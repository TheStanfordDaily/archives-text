# Coach Walter Powell Brings Back Favorable Impressions
## 
### 
"I found the rules committee to Ik* a
delightful bunch of men, very eager to
take suggestions and extremely anxious
to do anything in their power for the
good of football."
These are the impressions carried
back by Coach Walter Powell from the
meeting of the football rules commit
tee held at the Biltmore Hotel in New
York on March 11.
At the. meeting, Hall of Dartmouth
was elected cliairmun of the meeting,
while Walter Camp, one of the first
football coaches Stanford ever had and
of international fame as an authority
upon football was chosen secretary.
Camp has edited the rules for the game
for the past 25 years.
"I was very fortunate in knowing
several of the men on the committee
previous to the meeting." Coach Pow
ell stated, "I was particularly fortunate
in having worked under Camp at one
time. Camp is about 60 years old, and
of splendid physical condition, being

very quick and alert."
"Coach Hall of Dartmouth, who was
selected as chairman of the committee
was a very steady going fellow, and
was really responsible for the excellent
harmony of the meeting. The other
coaches upon the committee were Stagg
of Chicago, Williams of Wisconsin, and
Roper of Princeton."
"What struck me as particularly in
teresting was the fact that the coaches
addressed each other by their first
name. There was a great tendency on
the part of the coaches to wander off
into some particular game, when dis
cussing the rules and they had to be
repeatedly called back to business by
the chairman.
"The rules were found to be in very
good condition, and but few changes
had to be made. In discussing the rules
at the meeting, T found that opinions
of the coaches were held high by the
other members of the committee, and
that as a whole, the program was car
ried off with great success."
