# VARSITY IS TAKEN FOR WORKOUT ON CALIFORNIA FIELD
## Draper is Likely Beginner on Mound Against the Bruins In Second Game Saturday 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay led the Stanford
ball tossers to Berkeley today to work
out on the California diamond in pre
paration for the second game of the
series to be played there Saturday.
Drstper looks like the candidate to
start the slabbing against the Rruinß,
with Green receiving his «tlants. His
hand, which was operated npon last
week, is nearly healed and by Satur
day it chould be as good as ever.
Draper hi*' bo.-n working out daily
and is rapUily .(gaining his o*.ly sea
son form Bundy will probob'y alter
nate beh nri vhV'og with Green.
Patterson and Heckendorf are sure
to start the game at first and third
base but there may be some last-min
ute changes made in the second base
combination. Mitchell looks like the
second-sacker for the coming battle
in which event Kollam will play the
thort patch. If Mitchell is kept in the
outfield Maillot will do the short
stopping with Kallam on second base.
Kline, Crow and Carver look to be
the choices for the out-field, depend
ing, of course, on whether Mitchell
plays in or outfield. George Green
may play in either combination if
Bundy catches tne game.
