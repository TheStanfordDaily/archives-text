## 
### 
Artists of the mashie and niblick
will soon be given an opportunity to
display their skill, according to Dr.
Browne of the Physical Education de
partment. A golf club, to be known
as the Stanford Golf and Country
Club" is being rapidly organized, and
will include members of the faculty,
students, and residents of Palo Alto.
Los Altos and Menlo Park students
will be charge a nominal fee in order
that those interested in Inter-Col
legiate Golf may use the links. A
class in golf will be started as soon
as the links are completed.
The Trustees of the University have
given the club sixty acres of land
west of San Juan hill and have pro
mised assistance in the erection of &
clubhouse which will be undertaken
shortly. A nine-hole course has been
laid out, and will require very little
work to complete, as the ground is
both Hat and rolling, providing hazards
and b.unkers and reducing the cost of
construction a great deal.
An indoor practice cage is to be in
stalled in the gymnasium soon, and
can be used until the links are com
pleted.
Dr. Browne expects a large mem
bership, as the organization of such
a club fills a long felt need of the
University. He requests that students
be careful of the stakes marking the
course, as they have been moved or
carried away several times.
A meeting for the purpose of or
ganization will be held in the Little
Theater, April 13, at 8 o'clock.
