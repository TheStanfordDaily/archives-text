Both Graduate Manager Martin and the tennis leaders of Stanford
are to be congratulated on the extensive schedule announced today by
which the Cardinal representatives will compete with the best among
eastern and western university net champions.
This will be the first extensivewtrip for Stanford racquet men since
R. Lindley Murray, 13, and H. L. Hahn, '16, representing the Cardinal
in 1915 were undefeated in eight matches with teams of all parts of the
Kast; Harvard and Yale won doubles in the matches with the Stanford
men, but lost the tourneys with the singles, and were the only teams to
lake the measure of Murray and Hahn in any instance. The former,
v. previously unknown player, became the sensation of the tennis season.
The work of the representatives who made the trip in 1915 brought
the qualities of Stanford men and athletes to the attention of the East
arid West as probably no other event but the race of the Poughkeepsit
crew.
The Cardinal net men this year are unknown in national tennis
circles. They will compete with representatives of the best universities
in the country, and should bring nothing but credit to the name of
Stanford.
