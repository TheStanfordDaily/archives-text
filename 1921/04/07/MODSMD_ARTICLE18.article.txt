# AT BERKELEY SATURDAY
## 
### 
April 9 at Berkeley should be of unusual interest to supporters of
the Cardinal in other events as well as the California-Stanford baseball
contest. The Washington-California crew race will afford an opportu
nity to witness one of the pretty oar battles from which financial require
ments debar Stanford at present.
In the dual meet with Michigan we should see just what "Dink"
Templeton's squad must do a week later to cope with the blue and gold.
Duffy Seay's baseball combination will line up for the second con
test with California in which they must win to have a chance for the
1921 series. On the diamond Stanford has the men this year. Califor
nia earned a victory Saturday, but Stanford made more than the usual
number of "boots," due perhaps to necessary shifts requir
ing men to handle positions they were hardly prepared to cover. This
week Coach Seay will be able to straighten out the difficulty, and compe
tition should be stiff and interesting.
