## 
### 
"In all of my lectures and writings
I have always been trying to better
relations between Latin-America and
t
our country and I believe strongly in
the Pan-American movement especi
ally insofar as it tends to effect closer
cultural relationship," is Percy Alvin
Martin's aim as Associate Professor
of European History, as he himself
expressed it.
Professor Martin is a Stanford man,
'02, who before going to Harvard to
get an A. M. in 1907, first received it
here in 1903. Having studied at the
University of Paris he enrolled as a
student in the Universities of Berlin
and Leipzig during 1907-08, and after
returning, in 1912, he received a de
gree of Doctor of Philosophy from
Harvard.
He joined the instructing force at
Stanford in 1908 and has remained
here since that time except as the re
quests of other schools for his services
for a quarter have been granted. Har
vard, and Washington had courses in
Latin-American History given by Pro
fessor Martin in 1915 and 1916, res
pectively, the course at Harvard being
inaugurated in collaboration with the
eminent Brazilian historian, Manoel
de Oliviera Lima. He was also Pro
fessor of History and French, at Whit
tier College in 1904-05.
Professor Martin is well-known edi
torially in Pan-American affairs. He
is one of the Board of Editors of the

Brazil" based largely on data collected
by President Emeritus Branner. Dr.
Lima's series of lectures on "The

Evolution of Brazil compared with
Spanish and Anglo-Saxon America,"
which were given here in 1914, were

American relations. As Secretary of
the Brazilian section of the Pan-Amer
ican Financial Conference of 1920, he
drey up the report on this country's
condition and recommending methods
for effecting a post-war adjustment.
In 1915 he was delegate to the Second
Pan-American Scientific Congress at
Washington, concerning which he has
written a paper.
The American Historical Associa
tion has appointed Professor Martin
chairman of their committee to pro
vide for the society's participation in
the Pan-American Historical Congress
to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 1922
in honor of the centennary of Brazili
an Independence. This will be the
biggest historical convention ever held
in South America and is an appoint
ment of great importance.
At present the time is
taken up by a series of ten lectures,
to be given for the Albert Shaw

at Johns Hopkins University. The
subject will be "Latin America and
the War" and the lectures are to be
