# CABBAGES AND THINGS

® T. 1.. '23 <fr
With the coming of the Karnival,
Cabbages is getting all mixed up with
the King. One of our leading candi
dates remarks that he doesn't know
which is the worst joke. Leave it to
us, your Majesty. We can worst
most anything.

Goo Goo Gus now ambles out of the
tall, uncut, to remind us that we now
have the Cabbages, Things and Kings,
but lie doesn't see where the Valrus
comes in. Neither do we, Gus, but
don't let it worry you. Some walrus
is responsible for 'everything, any
way.

We hope our rising candidates have
read that worthy book entitled, "If I
Were King." If the nominees would
only stand in front of the polling
place and put on a pantomime por
traying what they would" do as Wazir
of Nawab or Subadahr of the Campus,
we would soon pick out the right
Sultan to support.

We have first-hand information that
the High Bazaza of Pago Pago has
sent his majestic congratulations to
none other than that august person
age the soon-to-be-elected Karnival
Konig. For Some season the missive
was left at the Men's Union.

If you can't freeze a rival out, make
It hot for him.

CRACKERJACK DOG
Mary had a dog named Ginger,
That had an awful trap,
And when he opened up his jaws,
We all heard Gingersnap.

"Life is just one. ...king after
another," remarks the Carnival Man
ager.

Hang-over Hank tells us that he
used to hunt snipes in Wisconsin.
Now he's shooting them on the Engi
neering Corner.
