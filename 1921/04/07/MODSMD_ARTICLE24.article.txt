et, being a history of her cycle of Ori
ental dances, by Ted Shawn. San Fran

Genius in art may mean an infinite
capacity for taking pains joined with
the power to invent an absolutely orig
inal style. But defining genius is a
perilous and academic business except
in so far that you may set its unique
ness safely apart from either labor
without inspiration, or novelty made
solely from eccentric tawdriness. Gen
ius must be read or heard or scon, and
not defined. And if, as in the esse of
great dancing genius, is inseparable from
personality it hardly needs to be for
malized in words; you may go "to de
fine, and remain to pray.
The publication of Mr. Ted Shawn's
volumes on the art of Ruth St. Denis
gives us an admirable preliminary pleas
ure before we see that art itself this
April Â«at Stanford. In Volume 1 Mr.
Shawn disentangles for us the old trite
story of art: An original genius striv
ing for years against the cynical antag
onism of the pure esthetes who dread
the new in art more than plague or mor
tal terror, the corrupt frivolity of theat
ucarl managers to whom the Oriental
dance meant only a degenerate ruck of
postures, and the slow li'ting of public
indifference to a now universal esreem.
In ovr own country Mis- St. Denis has
given tis so freely of her great talents
that we can do no less than admit a
genius impossible now to deny.
In volume 11. Mr. Shawn has ar
ranged photographs, whose sumptuous
beauty demonstrate that in dancing
Miss St. Denis has always striven for
that multiform adjustment of color,
light, music, setting, and rhythm which
Richard Wagner (in his own titanic
fashion) first revealed as the Art
wrought from all the arts. Certainly
these volumes in themselves prove that
dancing no less than music, is that em
bodiment of man's aspirations, which
takes visible afid exquisite form in a
rhythm catching the very stuff of
beauty.
