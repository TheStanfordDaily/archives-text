## 
### 
Do you "get by" your studies by
bluff? A well-known ciuupus writer
in the April issue of the Cardinal be
lieves that a surprisingly large num
ber of Stanford students are success
fully hoodwinking their professors and
securing unearned credits. A member
of the faculty when shown the article
declared that if it were true Stanford
methods of instruction should be re
volutionized.
In the April issue of the Cardinal,
the' concluding excerpts from the
autobiography of David Starr Jordan
will be published. Dealing with a
period in his life with which the pres
ent Stanford generation is compara
tively unfamiliar, the period of the
eighties, the extract will posses un
usual interest. Back numbers of the
Cardinal containing portions of Dr.
Jordan's autobiography may be se
cured by applying to the manager of
the magazine, Wylie Kilpatrick.
One of the f most significant articles
which has appeared in any campus
magazine this year is a discussion of
the crime wave by Professor W. G.
Beach of the Economics department.
One of the foremost authorities on
sociology in California, Dr. Beach's
article is an illuminating analysis of
the increasing American tendency to
wards crime.
