# CARDINAL NET TEAM TO INVADE EAST THIS YEAR
## Stanford Players will Clash with Teams of East and West; To Enter National Championships 
### 
Stanford will send a tennis team east this year and an extensive sched
ule has already been arranged with a large number of the universities of
the middle west and east. Graduate Manager Martin states that the trip
will be one of the longest ever taken by a western team and will not only
Include the Intercollegiate Championship Tournament of the U. S. f to be
held at Havenford, Pa., but will also take in a number of open tourna
ments and the National championship at Forrest Hills.
Previous to the Intercollegiate Championship Tournament at Havenford,
a number of matches with some of the strongest university teams of the
country have been scheduled and in most cases, the schedule is so filled that
it will necessitate the playing of a match every day.

The Pacific Coast Conference Tour
nament held at Eugene, Ore., on May
21, in conjunction with the Conference
track meet will he the first date of the
trip and from here the team will go
to the University of Washington, where
a match will be played May 23. The
trip from here takes them east to the
Universities of Chicago and Illinois,
artd the matches here head the list of
&Â»long series of tournaments which last,
through the entire summer, terminating
with the Invitational tournament at the
South Shore Country Club at Chicago
on September 18.
Two men will make up the team
which will represent Stanford in the
matches against the eastern schools, and
these will be selected from the present
varsity squad of Davies, Phil Neer,
Pish, Turner, J. Neer, Tussing, Par
ker and Devlin. The players will be
chosen according to rank at the time
the trip is taken, and a series of inter
team matches have been scheduled dur
ing the next month to give everyone an
opportunity to make a showing.
At the Pacific Conference tournament
to be held at Eugene this year, for the
first time in the history of the con
ference, every university in the con
ference will be represented by a full
team. Interest in tennis on the Coast
this year is greater than it ever has
been, and with such players as John
ston, Davis, Kiiisey and others who
have given the Pacific slope the su
premacy of the world in this sport, in
ter-collegiate tennis gives promise of a
brilliant future.
Several matches have been arranged
by tennis manager Ed. Rimpau, previous
to the eastern trip, and on April 15,
Stanford will be represented by a team
at the annual California Inter-collegiate
tournament at Ojai Valley. On April
24, about 10 Stanford men will be en
tered in the San Francisco city cham
pionship tournament. Last year, Davis
and Neer won the open and inter-col
legiate singles and inter-collegiate dou
bles at the Ojai tournament, losing the
remaining event by close sets.
