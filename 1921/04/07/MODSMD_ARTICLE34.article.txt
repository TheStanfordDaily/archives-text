# FINAL WORK ON NEW TENNIS COURTS BEGINS
## 
### 
Stanford's new pair of tennis courts
is approaching completion with the final
patch of aspalt laid last night by Con
tractor Quimby. Work with a roller
to smooth the surface, and to work in
a coating of marble dust was on this
morning. A border of mixed sand and
oil surrounding the courts will con
stitute the last surface work. By next
Monday the backstops will be started.
Later, bleachers having a capacity of
about 3000 will be put up, which can
accommodate the crowds desiring to
witness inter-collegiate matches. The
courts are to cost approximately $3000,
and will fill a long-felt need by pro
viding a suitable place to hold inter
collegiate and exhibition tournaments.
