# FRESHMAN BASEBALL TEAM BEATS LOWELL
## High School Nine Ties Score In Last Inning But Reese Triples and is Bunted Home 
### 
By a score of 3-2, the freshman nine
defeated Lowell High School yester
day afternoon, and although the game
was far from a perfect one, it was
close enough to suit the most exacting.
Only seven innings were played, an 1
at the end of the sixth the freshmen
were leading, 21. With two dowr..
Lowell rescued for a moment what
looked like a lost cause by taking a run
handed to them by the first-year nine.
Coach Righter's men came back in the
l.'tst half and working a hit and run
after a triple to center broke the tie
and ended the game.
Bonner opened the game on the
mound, but his arm was not in the
best of codnition, and Mertz relieved
him in the second, allowing only one
hit in the six innings he pitched. Bon
ner let the opposition have a single in
the first, bringing Lowell's total of
safeties to two. The freshman procured
four hits, including a double and a
triple, off Nounan, Lowell's slabster.
Five errors were made by the High
School team; four by the freshmen.
Reese scored the first nun in the open
ing inning by a single to center, and
completing the circuit on two errors.
The second tally came in the fourth
frame. Strong got as far as second
base when the right fielder refused to
catch his fly, and scored when Mertz
ripped off a double to right center.
In the meantime Lowell had crossed
the platter once. A double by Tapson
was converted into a round trip of the
bases when Strong let the ball go by
him in an attempt to trap Castignitto
off first base. Mertz had held the
enemy well in hand, however, and the
game looked safe, until the ice cracked
in the seventh. Berger was safe on
Strong's error, and took second en
O'Hay's out. Patterson struck out, and
Buchanan was about to do the same
when a passed ball got, him to first
and let the tieing run come in from
second.
The freshmen took their last chance
and put over the run that won. Reese,
with two strikes against him, tripled to
right, and came home when Coulter
made a nicc bunt on a hit and run
