# SANTA CLARA WINS FROM VARSITY NINE
## 
### 
Santa Clara defeated the Stanford
baseball nine on the Santa Clara dia
mond yesterday afternoon by a score
of 16 to 2. "Lefty" Berg did the
chucking for the Mission Team, and
was rapped for eight safeties by the
Stanford batters, but he kept them well
scattered throughout theÂ®nine innings.
Gray, Kelly, and Nef worked on the
slab for Seay's nine and the first two
were hit hard. Gray was knocked out
of the box by the Santa Clarans, and
Kelly, who relieved him suffered a like
fate. Nef succeeded in holding them
in check during the last three innings
Home runs were the order of the day
because the outfielders failed to equip
themselves with motorcycles and every
ordinary binglc into the outer gardens
rolled off the hills into the valleys be
low, and the hitter usually made the
circuit before the ball covdd be recov
ered.
