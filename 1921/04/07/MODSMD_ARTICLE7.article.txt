# BEST CONCESSION IN CARNIVAL WILL RECEIVE TROPHY
## E. A. Cochran of Palo Alto Is Donor of Handsome Award â€”Cup to Be Permanent 
### 
A handsome silver trophy cup has
been presented to the Spring Carnival
to be awarded to the best concession
entered at the Carnival. The donor
of the beautiful cup is E. A. Cochran,
Palo Alto jeweler. The Carnival com
mittee had intended to buy one of the
trophies to be given to the winning
concession, but the courtesy of Mr.
Cochran has brought the cup to the
campus as a free gift. The trophy is
now on exhibition at Cochran's, at
122 University Avenue. It will re
main there the balance of the week,
when it will be brought out to the
campus and will be placed in the
window of the Bookstore for exhibi
tion until the award to the winning
concession is made.
The award this year will be perma
nently the property of the winners of
the trophy. Concessions will be
judged by an impartial body of Uni
versity residents and the strictest
watch will be made that personal
bias does not influence the decision.
The different shows will be judged
partly on their appearance with re
gard to work spent on the concession,
and partly on the character of the
show itself. This is being done to get
away from any tendency to favor a
show on account of the outward ap
pearances of the staging. Different
concessions will be made up into
several classes and will be looked over
with others of the same class before
the flpal award is made.
