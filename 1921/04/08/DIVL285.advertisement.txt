"—but the wire has no hole for
electricity to flow through"
TT was a lawyer talking, and when he made
this brilliant observation an engineer present
couldn't help chuckling.
How absurd, he thought, that anybody
could be so ignorant of the properties of cur
rent electricity.
But by the way, oh stern critic, what are
mechanics' liens and what are the mutual
obligations of partners? When the talk turns
to law or business or the seven arts, have you
opinions to express and can you express them
without the fear of making a "break"?
Looked at in this light there seems to be
some sense to the argument for a broad cur
riculum for engineers.
Though your object should be first and fore
most to find out more than anybody else knows
about some specialized phase of engineering,
don't miss any chance to get acquainted with
every common interest which may influence
the social and industrial life of the day.
This is nothing but a matter of good busi
ness. It will enable you to meet men on their
own ground.
And because life is too full to learn every
thing about everything, this habit teaches the
greatest lesson of all —the necessity of getting
tat fundamentals and applying basic principles
already learned to each new problem.
It is this attitude of mind which will earn
you a place in the inner office where they dis
cuss, not details, you may be sure, but policies.

The electrical industry needs men who can
see far and think straight.
