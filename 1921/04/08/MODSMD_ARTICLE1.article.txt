# VARSITY TRACK SQUAD WILL SEE MICHIGAN MEET
## Week-end Rest is Prescribed by "Card" Coach; Records May Fall Next Saturday 
### 
"Dink" Templeton's \<arsity track
men have been taking things easy
this week with no competition set for
tomorrow. Most of the athletes will
travel over to Berkeley to watch
Walter Christie's proteges in action
against the Wolverines from the Uni
versity of Michigan.
With Jess Wells back on the cam
pus and in the track fold again, things
don't seem so blue around the train
ing quarters as they did when the
star hurdler announced his intention
of leaving the university. Wells'
father is somewhat improved and Jess
will undoubtedly be ready to toe the
mark against Henderson and Drew,
the Bruin stick men, a week from Sat
urday.
Preliminary work has started toward
getting the Stanford oval in shape for
the big meet. Indications are that
the track will be fast and several big
meet records are expected to go by
the boards. When Captain Morris
Kirksey and Bob Hutchinson, of the
Bears get together in the century and
the furlong the Stanford-California
records for there races should be shat
tered, providing of course, weather
conditions do not interfere. The pres
ent mark in the hundred is ten flat,
held jointly by several California and
Cardinal runners. Both the Stanford
captain and Hutchinson have beaten
this time consistently this season and
should do it again a week from to
morrow.
"Oxy" Hendrixson, the fleet Blue
and Gold quarter miler, may also shat
ter the mark in the 440 as he has
beaten the existing mark of 50 seconds
flat on several occasions.
