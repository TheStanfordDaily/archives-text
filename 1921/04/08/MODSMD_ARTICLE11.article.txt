# ELIHU ROOT VISITS CAMPUS YESTERDAY
## 
### 
Elihu Root visited the campus yes
terday afternoon as the guest of May
hew Newhall, president of the Univer
sity Board of Trustees. Mr. Root was
taken about the campus and was espe
cially interested in the Hoover War
Collection. He is, himself, a Hamil
ton College graduate, and has main
tained close touch with that institution.
He thinks that Stanford gains many
advantages of the small college, which
are missed by most large institutions
through the fact that practically all its
students live on the campus instead of
being scattered over a city. One of the
things that struck him as admirable at
Stanford was the standing given under
graduate activities through the assign
ment of offices in the Administration
Building.
