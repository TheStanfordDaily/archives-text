# Chaparral to Contribute Page to Independent
## 
### 
An entire page of the Independent for
April 9, is to be turned over to the
Stanford Chapparal. The sheet is to
be in the form of a take-off on the In
dependent itself.
The Stanford Chaparral is the first
university comic to contribute an en
tire page to the Independent. Pages
contributed by the Pennsylvania Punch
Bowl, The Cornell Widow and the Ne
braska Awgwan are to appear later.
