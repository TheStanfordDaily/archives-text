for first place among the men wa«
close and hotly contested all morning
with Joo sligntly the best in consist
ency. Margaret Lies opened the morn
ing in the lead and with the exception
of one spurt for Delia Taylor, kept
there with safe margin throughout the
voting. She seems to be at the pres
ent the favorite of the field, with Delia
Taylor an able second. Miss Lies is
a member of Gamma Phi Beta, and
is on the staff of editorial tryouteee
for the 1923 Quad.
The remaining candidates in the

The voting stopped today at 1:00
this afternoon, until Monday morning,
when it will continue all day and un
til Tuesday, at 12:15. The lists of both
men and women were cut to five at
11:30 this morning. Considerable ex
citement developed among the back
ers of the various candidates at the
announcement of the cut and voting
for the leaders began to jump up.
The stop of the free voting from the
Daily Palo Alto coupons brought a
large number of hidden ballots out al
so at the last minute and caused a
furor in the tallying with backers
rushing around to gather up all the
outstanding free coupons at the last
minute and cast them for the favo
rites
The dope is that there is a big
fund for one of the candidates being
held in the hole, with the idea of
springing a big "coup d'etat" at the
last minute. Which one of the sev
eral partieß has this one in reserve
is not said, but there promises to be
some interesting developments on
Monday, and up to Tuesday noon.
