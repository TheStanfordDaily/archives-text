# A 						QUESTION FOR SENIORS
## 
### 
The class of 1921 must either take up the endowment plan of insur
ance in favor of the University, or disregard the precedent of last year's
graduating class. This question is one that must be decided by the
seniors in the near future, and members of the class should be prepared
lo say whether they are solidly in favor of or against the plan.
Without going into the merits of the endowment proposition, it is
clear that to make worth while any efforts in the direction of supporting
• lie University by this method, it must be understood and actively backed
l>y the whole class.
The taking out of insurance must be voluntary to be of substantial
results, and this can be effected only by a thorough class spirit behind
the plan. The success or failure of the project not depend on the
work of a few solicitors who spend night and day at the end of the
quarter trying to swell the total in face of general indifference. To be
of value to the University, which is the purpose of the plan, it must have
general active favor of the class of 1921 ; and whether or not it will
have this, the seniors must decide in a few days.

OUR FRESHMEN TENNIS TEAM may prove of quite likely class
in their matches with California tomorrow. The first-year racqueters
have been giving clever performances of late and should be excellent
representatives in the new major sport. There is, of course, no reason
why the 1924 class should be alone in backing their team.

WHEN THE VARSITY NINE takes the diamond against the Rlue
and Gold at 3 :30 Saturday afternoon, the men should not have to look
to the bleachers to learn if there are Cardinal supporters there.
