## 
### 
Appearing on the Quad for sale the
first of next week, the April issue of
The Cardinal is a number whose inter
est ranges from the literary and polit
ical to the critical analysis of student
problems. The Stanford public will be
afforded an opportunity to dip into the
autobigraphy of David Starr Jordan,
which will be published next year in
book form by an eastern publishing
house. A third and final extract from
the life story of the former president
is contained in the April issue.
The prevelant crime wave has aroused
the interest of numerous social inves
tigators during recent months. None
of the published reports on the sub
ject is more illuminating than the ar
ticle contributed by Professor W. G.
Reach, whose sociological research en
ables hi in to write of the crime wave in
an authoritative manner.
Warren Lewis, the new editor of The
Cardinal, is the author of one of the
several stories of the issue. A leader
of student opinion, whose name is
well known to the entire campus con
tributes a frank analysis of student ef
forts to bluff their professor.
