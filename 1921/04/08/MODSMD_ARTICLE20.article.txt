The Varsity
Alice Brady is being starred at the
Varsity in "Out of the Chorus." In
thia picture life is dealt with as it is
lived on the stage and off. Alice
Brady is the Chorus girl who marries
the son of a wealthy family, goes
through the agony of breaking into
society, is a victim of gossip, goes
back to the footlights again, and is
then reclaimed by her husband. It
is a slightly new treatment of one of
the old plots, but Alice Brady herself
does a beautiful piece of acting and
the settings are lovely. Alice Brady
is an artist and her work always has
that finish that speaks for complete
confidence and knowledge of it.
Cinderella Advertises a Twin
Viola Dana is playing at the Stan
ford in "Cinderella's Twin." Viola
has a sweet personality that wins her
way through the light comedy pic
tures that she stars in. This picture
is one of her best and boasts of a
rather clever plot based on the old
fairy tale, "Cinderella."
