dwells in our midst, even as a snake

simple campus residents? And further,
have you been appraised of the fact
that, since this committee is working
without name publicity, any one of
the easy-looking profs you see may be
a sleuth in disguise? Speedsters,
take heed. An intellectual look may
be accompanied by flat feet.

A wild looking ruff was standing in
front of the Karnival election joint
yesterday snapping his fingers and
earnestly beseeching the Fates to
respond to his prayer which went,

Come on, you four." We later learned
that he was rooting for "Little Joe."

was referred to the other day as the
"Palo Alto Spine." It takes a lot of
backbone to boot one like that.
