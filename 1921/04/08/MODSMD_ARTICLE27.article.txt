# Local Y. W. C. A. Leaders Will Leave For Saratoga
## 
### 
This afternoon the leaders of the
Girl's Reserve Corps of the local Y.
W. C. A. left for their usual house
party at Saratoga. Those who make
up the party this year are the out
going leaders and those who will take
over the Corps for the coming year.
Miss Esther Damon, Pacific Coast
Girls' Work Secretary, will also be
one of the party. She has come down
to give those who are at the head
of the local Corps a special training
in order to fit them to take up new
work this summer.
