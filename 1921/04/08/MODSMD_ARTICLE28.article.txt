# FRESHMEN TO SWIM AGAINST BERKELEY TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
Swimming will be the main event on
the freshman sport program for Satur
day, as the team meets Berkeley High
in one of the meets that are being held
preliminary to the clash with the Cali
fornia babes on April 22.
The whole team will be on hand, and
with nothing unforeseen happening,
Berkeley should be beaten without much
difficulty, according to Coach Brand
sten. 'he team has been working con
sistently all season, and is for the most
part in good condition. Berkeley has
not the reputation of having an espe
cially strong team, but will furnish
enough opposition to make the freshmen
work to win.
The team seems to be strongest in the
water polo, breast stroke and back
stroke, and a well balanced team has
been the result.
