# Men of Euphronia Are Ready Victims of Wranglers' Net

Crestfallen members of Euphronia
Debating Society went down to defeat
before clever arguments and skillful
Hhifting of the question when they met
Wrangler's Society in an informal dis
cussion at the Woman's Clubhouse
last night. The question was: "Re
solved, that Stanford University Bhould
discontinue co-education," and the
guileless men who upheld the nega
tive side of the question, took it for
granted that the choice lay between
leaving Stanford a co-educational in
stitution or barring out the women.
Clever reasoning by Anne Hardy, '21,
Dorothy Wegster, '21, left the men in
a most deplorable predicament with
nothing left to stand on but the two
extremes of braggado and lofty flights
of sentiment.
C. E. Alexander, '22, made much of
the point that women were the source
of inspiration and pictured a Stanford
of full beards and lumberjacks'
clothes in case the women were kept
away. His burst of heroic praise car
ried him away to such an extent that
hd sang a song in clear soprano tones
which brought a hilarious applause
from the women.
"About 90 per cent of the women
marry men, and therefore above all
things they should know men," said
E. W. Landels, '21, and he proceeded
to show that Stanford affords them un
limited opportunity to learn men.
Miss Webster layed this argument low
by declaring that by learning leader
ship in a woman's college a woman
can then learn men much faster.
The turn of the whole discussion
was that the men could take their
choice between Stanford as it is or
Stanford as the women's college of the
West. Then to soothe the wounded
feelingn the girls served chocolate,
cookies, and candy, and showed there
by that they knew men pretty well.
No definite conclusion was reached on
the question but it was agreed that the
evening was enjoyed by all.
