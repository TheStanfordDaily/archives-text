# UNEXPECTED PUNCH WIELDED BY SHAW'S SATIRE, PYGMALION
## 
### 
Hot Potato. Pardon the ele
gance of our diction but the Renais
sance Club surely careswed us in the
midriff. We had their "Pygmalion"
show all doped out as a nice quiet
kittle affair for the highbrows and
dumb-bells but we were all wrong,
AloysiuH, all wrong.
Speaking of problem plays, how is
this? A professor gets a fool notion
that he ran take a girl right off the
streets, educate her and get her ac
cepted by polite socioty. That prob
ably conilrms some of your private
opinions regarding profs in general,
but, man, He started something when
he picked out Liza for the experiment.
This Liza girl creates a greater stir
than Stidgey'B choc malt mixers. She
smokes cigarettes, drops her "li's"
all over the place and cusses in a
manner that makes the Engineering
Corner roughs look like amateurs.
Sounds like a Ram's Head show in
the good old days, doesn't it? But
it's by Shaw, doncherknow, and con
veys some clever social satire and all
that sort cf thing. Therefore It gets
by with the highbrows and the Purity
League but just the same we've got
a hunch that we are going to enjoy
that show Saturday night in the As
sembly Hall.
