# CANVAS ARRIVES FOR ERECTION OF FIESTA CONCESSION HOUSES
## 
### 
Several hundred square yards of
heavy canvas arrived last night for the
sides of the Carnival concessions that
will be put up tomorrow, to house the
shows in the mammoth Spanish Fiesta
next week. This canvas has been pur
chased by the Associated Student Body,
and will be rented to groups on the
campus for any functions that require
the use of such material for decora
tion.
Work on the arrangements for the
fiesta has been going on the last two
weeks and now everything is in readi
yess for the erection of the frame-work
that will form the outlines of the va
rious streets and booths in the Carni
val. The shape of the miniature city
that is to be laid out will be in a sort
of "L" with two sets of thoroughfares.
One will run from the swimming pool
toward the car track, and t he other in
the opposite direction near the west
end of the gymnasium. The streets will
be harrowed as much as possible so as
to conform with the general Spanish ar
chitectural type of planning, and yet
to allow enough room for the crowds
that will throng the enclosure of the
gymnasium fence during the evening.
In the matter cf entrance payment
this year there will be a method whereby
all the cash will be handled by a cen
tral body of ticket takers and sellers.
Booths will be distributed around the
inside of the enclosure where tickets to
all the concession may be purchased, but
no cash will l>e taken at any of the
shows. The tickets will be universally
accepted and will be for a certain
amount., obviating the necessity for
making change at entrances of conces-
J sions or in the shows. At the main en
trance to the rone of entertainment
there will be a central ticket station
where people entering will be able to
buy blocks of tickets for the evening.
To keep the crowds moving and clear
the avenues of travel there will be an
adequate police force. Special officers
have volunteered to help out for the
evening, and will furnish protection for
the spectators and also fun for those
who see the jail and court in opera
tion.
Members of the Carnival Committee
will be on hand early tomorrow morn
ing to oversee the construction of the
Spanish city, and the work will be un
der the direct supervision of Construc
tion Superintendent Ben S. Parks. The
assistance of everyone who has a free
hour is asked and particularly the help
of the Freshmen. Everyone reporting
is asked to bring a hammer if possible.
