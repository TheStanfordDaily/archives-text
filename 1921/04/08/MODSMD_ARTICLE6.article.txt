# SHAW'S SUBJECT IN "PYGMALION" IS CALLED DARING
## Can Low-Brow' Become 'High-Brow' is Question; Author Thinks it Possible 
### Jeanne Elmendorf 
Shaw's theme in "Pygmalion," to be
given in the Assembly Hall tomorrow
night, is daring to say the least. He
has chosen for his heroine "Liza," a
girl of the streets, and has made her
the subject of an experiment in refine
ment, and the task of Pygmalion is tn
make a lady of her and a "high-brow"
at that.
A sarcastic by stander says, "If you
polish a poor piece of wood you will
only show up the flaws." However,
the professor thinks differently, and
goes about to prove his theory. Imagine
the consternation of the stately Mrs.
Higgins when Pygmalion drags this
street girl in to her drawing rooms?
(Shades of Nazimova in the "Brat.")
Liza is the original "Brat" used by
Maud Fulton her play.
Shaw develops the possibilities of the
situation with consummate artistry and
provides all his characters with such
clever lines that there is no moment of
dullness.
The cast is almost entirely composed
of professionals, the principals of which
are known throughout California. Sam
Hume, Irving Pitchel and Violette Wil
son have the leads.
Several elaborate scenic devices will
be employed in the Stanford production,
among them a violent rainstorm. Irving
Pitchel has taken personal charge of the
production and takes a leading part in
the play.
The play was first produced in Eu
rope, ' playing in Vienna and then in
London. During the Panama-Pacific
Exposition it was given by Mrs. Pat
rick Campbell at the Columbia Theater
in San Francisco. Mrs. Campbell cre
ated the part of Liza and added much
to the popularity of the play.
The play will begin promptly at 8
o'clock in the Assembly Hall tomorrow
evening. Ambrose Whitmer's orches
tra will play between the acts.
