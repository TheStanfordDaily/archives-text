ber of courses especially designed

fornia, Southern Branch, will give a

Development. This will be a part of
the special program which is being
arranged for teachers of physical
education.
The courses in the Stanford School
of Education are primarily designed
for men who have had practical ex
perience in teaching and who are
fitting themselves to hold higher po
sitions, although a number of courses
are of a character to be taken with
profit by general students, especially
those in the history of education and
in the general theory of educational
problems.
An interesting feature in connec
tion with the summer quarter of the
School of Education will be the reg
ular Thursday evening lectures on
