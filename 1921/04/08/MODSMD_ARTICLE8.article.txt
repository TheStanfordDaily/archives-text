# DRAPER TO HURL SECOND GAME AGAINST BLUE AND GOLD NINE AT BERKELEY
## 
### Harry J. Borba, '22 
Guy Draper will do the chucking
for the Stanford varsity baseball
team tomorrow at Berkeley, against
the Bruins of the University of Cali
fornia. Draper has entirely recovered
from the operation he underwent last
week for an infected hand and with
the exception of a slight soreness in
his left paw iB ready to hurl the Car
dinal nine to victory if he is given the
proper support. Draper was pitching
a wonderful brand of baseball before
his misfortune and is extremely con

lident that he caii best Zamloek's
crew on their own lot.
Captain Bundy or George Green will
do the catching or probably each will
get in for part of the game. Both are
hitting well and it ia difficult to pick
between them so a final choice to start
the game will not bo made until the
team takes the field in the first in
ning.
O'Neill, the fox of the California
pitchers, is slated to oppose Draper
on the hillock. O'Neill had a busy
afternoon warming up the old souper
last Saturday when his team-mate
Morrow was wobbly at different stages
of the game but it was evident that
Coach Zamlock was saving him to
show before the "hum" fans on the
Berkeley lot tomorrow. Either Smith
or Toomey will handle the big mitt.
Seay this morning announced the
personnel of the infield. Kallam who
played shortstop throughout the pre
liminary season will be back at his
old job tomorrow. Kallam played
nice ball around the keystone hassock
la s t week but Mitchell who slapped
'em in the outfield last Saturday comes
back to his first love, second base,
for the second game so "Kal" will
again do the shortstopping. This com
bination was very successful during
the early season and there is every
reason to believe that with these men
working in their best form Stanford's
infield will be as go«ti if not better
than the Bruin inner works. Patter
son at first base has been playing
hangup ball all season and is due to
pickle a couple of O'Neill's slants to
morrow, as he did not hit in the last
contest. If "Pat" clicks the first one
it is safe to look for two or three
more base-knocks from him before the
contest ends, as he hits in bunches.
"Lefty" Heckendorf will be on the job
at the other corner of the diamond.
Heckendorf has no trouble in gather
ing in the torrid liners that scoot
third-baseward and is a fairly good
hitter.
Kline, who fields and bats from the
port side, is to take care of center
field. "Mort" has been going great
guns in all the games played thus
far and it was his willow-wielding
that was responsible for the three
Stanford tallies in the first California
game. Roy Carver will do the left
fielding with either Crowe or Maillot
in right field.
Seay may, at the !a?t momenv put
one of his catchers In right fle'd a*,
both of them are valwblo men with
the bat and it is hitting strength that
is going to count in tomorrow's con
test.
Over at Berkeley, Zamlock seems
to oe well satisfied with his team as
it now staid}, lie nelieves that his
outfit can turn the ihort end of »:• 3
score to the Stanford side of the sheet
again and is willing to let his team
stand as it is.
Hermle, White, G. Makin, and H.
Makin make up the California infield
and a very strong combination they
are. too. All are clever fielders, while
Hermle and Q. Makin have the mean
Ik
habit of poking them hither and yon
where the fielders "ain't."
Captain "Moke" Myers, Radebaugh,
and Rowe will again take care of the
Bruin outfield.
All told this gives promise of be
ing some ball grime and California
can by no means be picked as tho
winner. After the first' inning last
Saturday it was a close affnir and the
plan tomorrow is to avoid any first
inning occurrences that will place the
Stanford nine in the holo.

Kline, who fields and bats from the
port side, is to take care of center
field. "Mort" has been going great
guns in all the games played thus
far and it was his willow-wielding
that was responsible for the three
Stanford tallies in the first California
game. Roy Carver will do the left
fielding with either Crowe or Maillot
in right field.
Seay may, at the !a?t momenv put

Over at Berkeley, Zamlock seems

Hermle, White, G. Makin, and H.
Makin make up the California infield
and a very strong combination they
are. too. All are clever fielders, while
Hermle and Q. Makin have the mean

habit of poking them hither and yon
where the fielders "ain't."
Captain "Moke" Myers, Radebaugh,
and Rowe will again take care of the
Bruin outfield.
All told this gives promise of be
ing some ball grime and California
can by no means be picked as tho
winner. After the first' inning last
Saturday it was a close affnir and the

inning occurrences that will place the
Stanford nine in the holo.

Guy Draper will do the chucking
for the Stanford varsity baseball
team tomorrow at Berkeley, against
the Bruins of the University of Cali
fornia. Draper has entirely recovered
from the operation he underwent last
week for an infected hand and with
the exception of a slight soreness in
his left paw iB ready to hurl the Car
dinal nine to victory if he is given the
proper support. Draper was pitching
a wonderful brand of baseball before
his misfortune and is extremely con

lident that he caii best Zamloek's
crew on their own lot.
Captain Bundy or George Green will
do the catching or probably each will
get in for part of the game. Both are
hitting well and it ia difficult to pick
between them so a final choice to start
the game will not bo made until the
team takes the field in the first in
ning.
O'Neill, the fox of the California
pitchers, is slated to oppose Draper
on the hillock. O'Neill had a busy
afternoon warming up the old souper
last Saturday when his team-mate
Morrow was wobbly at different stages
of the game but it was evident that
Coach Zamlock was saving him to
show before the "hum" fans on the
Berkeley lot tomorrow. Either Smith
or Toomey will handle the big mitt.
Seay this morning announced the
personnel of the infield. Kallam who
played shortstop throughout the pre
liminary season will be back at his
old job tomorrow. Kallam played
nice ball around the keystone hassock
la s t week but Mitchell who slapped
'em in the outfield last Saturday comes
back to his first love, second base,
for the second game so "Kal" will
again do the shortstopping. This com
bination was very successful during
the early season and there is every
reason to believe that with these men
working in their best form Stanford's
infield will be as go«ti if not better
than the Bruin inner works. Patter
son at first base has been playing
hangup ball all season and is due to
pickle a couple of O'Neill's slants to
morrow, as he did not hit in the last
contest. If "Pat" clicks the first one
it is safe to look for two or three
more base-knocks from him before the
contest ends, as he hits in bunches.
"Lefty" Heckendorf will be on the job
at the other corner of the diamond.
Heckendorf has no trouble in gather
