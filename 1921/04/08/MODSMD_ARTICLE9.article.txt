# BABES TO MEET BEARS IN TENNIS
## Captain R. Hinckley Will Play Lead-off Game in Initial Tennis Match for Freshmen 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock, the
Stanford freshmen tennis team will
meet the California first year raquet
men in the annual inter-collegiate tour-!
nament. The matches will be played on
the Berkeley courts and are a part of
the big athletic program the Califor
nians will stage tomorrow, coming be
fore the conference crew race between
California and Washington.
Yesterday, final preliminary matches
were played between the players on the
freshmen squad to determine those who
would compete against California and
a final ranking was Riven each man. In
the matches tomorrow. Captain R.
Hinckley will play the leadoff match,
while Theodore Mertz and B. Leeds will
complete the singles matches.
There will be only five matches in
the tournament Saturday, three of which
are singles, and the remaining two are
doubles. In the doubles, Hinckley has
been matched with Norman Deßack,
while Ted Mertz and David Mannoccir
will compose the other team.
This will be the first time that a Stan
ford freshman tennis team has lined up
against the Blue and Gold with tennis
a major sport, and the chances for a
Cardinal victory are bright. The Cali
fornia team, although a steady combi
nation, has been weakened to a great
extent by the loss of two ranking play
ers due to probation. With Hinckley
playing probably the best junior game
on the Coast and Mertz showing better
in every match, the freshmen should
have little trouble in winning the tour
nament tomorrow.
D. Radke who ranks first among the
Blue and Gold freshmen will probably
be pitted against Hinckley, while F.
Vincens will meet Ted Mertz. R. Car
son and O'Connell arc fighting for the
right to play in the third match, and
one o fthem will go against B. Leeds in
the final of the singles matches.
In the doubles matches, the Stanford
first doubles team composed of Hinck
lcy and Deßack will meet Radke and
Vincens. Mertz and Mannoccir play the
concluding match of the tournament
against Carson and O'Connell.
