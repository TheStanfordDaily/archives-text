# CARDINAL DROPS SECOND CONTEST AND SERIES. 2-1
## O'Neill Bests Draper on Slab and Zamlock's Team Takes Large End of Close Game 
### Harry J. Borba, '22 
O'Neill had a slight edge on Draper
in a pitcher's battle and as a result
California won the second game and
the series from Stanford on the Berke
ley lot Saturday afternoon. The score
was 2 to 1. Both heaVers were in ,/lne
fettle and the contest early resolved
itself into a duel with O'Neill main
taining a slight edge throughout.
The Bruins gave their slabster a
lead in the second inning when they
chased over the first run of the game.
Radebaugh singled infield and took
second when Draper made a wild
heave to first base. Green who was
handling Draper's slants made a snap
throw to second base in an effort to
catch Radebaugh who had wandered
too far from his safety base. It was
a perfect throw, so perfect in fact
that it hit the unwary Bruin as he
then t'rnsed wildly to first base. H.
that he had to be taken from the
game. Douthit was sent in to run for
him and moved on to third when Erb
sacrificed. H. Makin then rapped a
double between center and right field
and Douthit crossed the rubber with
the first run of the game.
O'Neill managed to keep out of
danger until the sixth frame when
Mitchell got a life on Erb's boot of
a ground ball. Kallam sacrificed,
Mitchell moved on to second base, and
Captain "Doug" Bundy came on the
scene. Bundy cracked a short hit
into left field that went for two sacks
and Mitchell trotted home with the
tying run.
California came right back in the
next inning and chased over the run
that proved to be the winner. Erb
drove a liner at Heckendorf which the
stocky third baseman fumbled and
apiece off the elongated Bruin slab-
Makin again rose to the occasion with
a two-base knock to deep center field
and Erb Bcored.
Kallam was injured in a collision
with Rowe at second base in the
fourth inning. Rowe received the only
free pass that Draper handed out dur
ing the game. Douthit who followed
him hit a dinky pop,fly which Draper
gathered in on the third base line. It
took "Shad" a second or two to rea
lize that he might move on to second
baso on the play, then he started.
Draper made a quick throw to Kal
lam who was ten feet down the line.
Rowe hurrying along to make up time
forgot the rule which says a base
