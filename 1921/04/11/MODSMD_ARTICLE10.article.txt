# ENTERTAINMENT CARD FOR "SOPH" SMOKER SHOWS CLEVER ACTS
## 
### 
The program announced for the class
smoker and get-together to be given by
the Sophomore Class tomorrow night,
contains some features that promise to
make the evening a from every
angle. Aside from a few business mat
ters that will be taken up to obviate the
necessity of calling a class meeting, the
evening will be devoted to the speakers
and the performers of variety acts.
David Starr Jordan will be the
principal speaker of the evening, and
although his subject has not been an
nounced, the Chancellor's ability to
speak interestingly upon all occasions is
well known upon the campus.
Jack Heffernan will act as lead-off
man for the stunt performers, and his
contribution will be a number of his
musical hits, which, from all reports,
knocked the audiences out of their seats
upon their presentation by Heffernan
during the recent tour of the Glee Club.
Dick Malaby, another campus notable
"in musical circles, will give a number
of selections from his fund of choice
musical numbers.
There will be several boxing matches
and one take-off bout. The latter, by
its novelty, will be a sure-fire laugh
getter. The headliner of the boxing
matches will be a tliree-round go be
tween Burkhart and Lane, who have
been seen in action at Encina Gymnasi
um a number of times, and therefore
need no introduction to the campus
fans. ,
Don Huttou will have a campus or
chestra on the scene to add additional
entertainment for the evening, so the
session will not drag for lack of fire.
Howard Brown, chairman of the
smoker committee, has mailed invitation
cards to the mil of the class of '23,
and admission to the Stanford Union
tomorrow night will be through these
cards. The program will begin at 8
o'clock.
