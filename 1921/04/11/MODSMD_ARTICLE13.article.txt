# CALIFORNIA BABE NINE VICTORIOUS IN SECOND GAME
## Season's Series Goes to Bruins With Two Games Won; Good Playing Wins; 7-2 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
For the second time in succession
this season the California babes de
feated Stanford's freshman baseball
nine, Friday's game going to the Blue
and Gold by the tally of 7 to 2. This
gives them the series.
Everything went wrong for the Car
dinal freshmen. When they had men
on bases and a chance to win, in
stead of the hit that would have done
the work, there was only a strike-out
forthcoming. Six times the batter
struck out when a hit would have
meant a run. On the other hand, Call
fornia's bingles came at exactly the
right times. Stanford made five er
rors, and four of them helped Blue and
Gold runs across. California played
a better game, but also got all the
breaks, which exaggerated the differ
ence between the two teams.
Loewenstein hurled the whole game
for Stanford with the exception of the
lafct part of the ninth inning, when he
was relieved by Mertz. His removal
was not due to any bombardment of
hits, but poor support put him in a
bad hole, and hindered him through
out the game. He allowed only eight
safe swats, while Heidt, California's
hurler, yielded eleven. But Heidt had
an uncanny way of striking out men
whenever he needed to most. He got
rid of ten Cardinal batters this way,
and pulled himself of of many a deep
hole.
Heidt was the most prominent figure
of the game, with his effective pitch
ing. Coulter and Holmes played a
good game for the Stanford freshmen,
the former getting two hits, a stolen
base and handling five put-outs with
out a bobble, while Holmes let only
one base be stolen on him and played
an errorless game, besides stealing two
bases himself and garnering a hit.
Eight bases were pilfered off the Cali
fornia catcher, Palmer.
California pulled the trigger in the
second and shot three runs over the
plate before the inning closed. A
double to right by Sears followed by
Lowenstein's error, and a singlo by
Heidt, who thus won his own game,
were the specific reasons for the
crash. In their half, Righter's men
were given a chance to win when
Holmes was hit by a pitched ball and
Deffenbach walked. Loewenstein
made the third out, however, by flying
to right*. The third inning brought
more results. Woodward opened with
a single to left and was advanced on
Coulter's timely hit. Reese flew out
to right. Colvin then brought Wood
ward in when the opposition failed on
a fielder's choice. A chance to make
more runs was lost when Smurr and
Strong struck out.
Loewenstein held California well in
hand for the -next five innings.
Meanwhile, Stanford lost another good
chance to catch up in the fifth. Coul
ter opened with another hit and stole
second. Reese went out, short to first,
and Colvin succeeded in dumping a
bunt along the first base line with
out getting put oufi With two men
on bases, Heidt retired the next two
batters via the strike-out and grounder
routes.
The sixth was a little better. Def
fenbach walked and stole second.
Loewenstein drove him in with a single
to center. Heidt tightened up again
I and Woodward was out on a grounder
|to first, Coulter following with a
1 strike-out.
Two "hits in the seventh counted for
nothing. Reese singled to left, but
j was out stealing. Colvin singled, but
! Smurr hit into a double play, ending
the inning. The eighth was 110 better,
j Holmes hit safely to right and stole
j second, but was out, short to third,
on the next play. The last faint hope
' was smothered in the ninth. Wood
ward struck out and Coulter flew to
! second. Reese started what looked
i like might be a rally, by a single to
| center, but Colvin could do nothing
1 and grounded out, second to first.
California broke loose'- with one
I marker in the eighth. An error by
! Colvin, followed by a single to center
1 and a fly tb the same place, were all
! that were made. This was just a
1 sample, however of the ninth, when
the Blue freshmen spiked the
, plate three times more and called it
a day. Hourinan sapped a hard one
into left. Two errors by Woodward,
and two more singles were sufficient
cause for what happened. Holmes
; ended the procession when he caught
; the last two men trying to steal.

For the second time in succession
this season the California babes de
feated Stanford's freshman baseball
nine, Friday's game going to the Blue
and Gold by the tally of 7 to 2. This
gives them the series.
Everything went wrong for the Car
dinal freshmen. When they had men
on bases and a chance to win, in
stead of the hit that would have done
the work, there was only a strike-out
forthcoming. Six times the batter
struck out when a hit would have
meant a run. On the other hand, Call
fornia's bingles came at exactly the
right times. Stanford made five er
rors, and four of them helped Blue and
Gold runs across. California played
a better game, but also got all the
breaks, which exaggerated the differ
ence between the two teams.
Loewenstein hurled the whole game
for Stanford with the exception of the
lafct part of the ninth inning, when he
was relieved by Mertz. His removal
was not due to any bombardment of
hits, but poor support put him in a
bad hole, and hindered him through
out the game. He allowed only eight
safe swats, while Heidt, California's
hurler, yielded eleven. But Heidt had
an uncanny way of striking out men
whenever he needed to most. He got
rid of ten Cardinal batters this way,
and pulled himself of of many a deep
hole.
Heidt was the most prominent figure
of the game, with his effective pitch
ing. Coulter and Holmes played a
good game for the Stanford freshmen,
the former getting two hits, a stolen
base and handling five put-outs with
out a bobble, while Holmes let only
one base be stolen on him and played
an errorless game, besides stealing two
bases himself and garnering a hit.
Eight bases were pilfered off the Cali
fornia catcher, Palmer.
California pulled the trigger in the
second and shot three runs over the
plate before the inning closed. A
double to right by Sears followed by
Lowenstein's error, and a singlo by
Heidt, who thus won his own game,
were the specific reasons for the
crash. In their half, Righter's men
were given a chance to win when
Holmes was hit by a pitched ball and
Deffenbach walked. Loewenstein
made the third out, however, by flying
to right*. The third inning brought
more results. Woodward opened with
a single to left and was advanced on
Coulter's timely hit. Reese flew out
to right. Colvin then brought Wood
ward in when the opposition failed on
a fielder's choice. A chance to make
more runs was lost when Smurr and
Strong struck out.
Loewenstein held California well in
hand for the -next five innings.
Meanwhile, Stanford lost another good
chance to catch up in the fifth. Coul
ter opened with another hit and stole
second. Reese went out, short to first,
and Colvin succeeded in dumping a
bunt along the first base line with
out getting put oufi With two men
on bases, Heidt retired the next two
batters via the strike-out and grounder
routes.
The sixth was a little better. Def
fenbach walked and stole second.
Loewenstein drove him in with a single
to center. Heidt tightened up again
I and Woodward was out on a grounder
|to first, Coulter following with a
1 strike-out.
Two "hits in the seventh counted for
nothing. Reese singled to left, but
j was out stealing. Colvin singled, but
! Smurr hit into a double play, ending
the inning. The eighth was 110 better,
j Holmes hit safely to right and stole
j second, but was out, short to third,
on the next play. The last faint hope
' was smothered in the ninth. Wood
ward struck out and Coulter flew to
! second. Reese started what looked
i like might be a rally, by a single to
| center, but Colvin could do nothing
1 and grounded out, second to first.
California broke loose'- with one
I marker in the eighth. An error by
! Colvin, followed by a single to center
1 and a fly tb the same place, were all
! that were made. This was just a
1 sample, however of the ninth, when
the Blue freshmen spiked the
, plate three times more and called it
a day. Hourinan sapped a hard one
into left. Two errors by Woodward,
and two more singles were sufficient
cause for what happened. Holmes
; ended the procession when he caught
; the last two men trying to steal.

For the second time in succession
this season the California babes de
feated Stanford's freshman baseball
nine, Friday's game going to the Blue
and Gold by the tally of 7 to 2. This
gives them the series.
Everything went wrong for the Car
dinal freshmen. When they had men
on bases and a chance to win, in
stead of the hit that would have done
the work, there was only a strike-out
forthcoming. Six times the batter
struck out when a hit would have
meant a run. On the other hand, Call
fornia's bingles came at exactly the
right times. Stanford made five er
rors, and four of them helped Blue and
Gold runs across. California played
a better game, but also got all the
breaks, which exaggerated the differ
ence between the two teams.
Loewenstein hurled the whole game
for Stanford with the exception of the
lafct part of the ninth inning, when he
was relieved by Mertz. His removal
was not due to any bombardment of
hits, but poor support put him in a
bad hole, and hindered him through
out the game. He allowed only eight
safe swats, while Heidt, California's
hurler, yielded eleven. But Heidt had
an uncanny way of striking out men
whenever he needed to most. He got
rid of ten Cardinal batters this way,
and pulled himself of of many a deep
hole.
Heidt was the most prominent figure
of the game, with his effective pitch
ing. Coulter and Holmes played a
good game for the Stanford freshmen,
the former getting two hits, a stolen
base and handling five put-outs with
out a bobble, while Holmes let only
one base be stolen on him and played
an errorless game, besides stealing two
bases himself and garnering a hit.
Eight bases were pilfered off the Cali
fornia catcher, Palmer.
California pulled the trigger in the
second and shot three runs over the
plate before the inning closed. A
double to right by Sears followed by
Lowenstein's error, and a singlo by
Heidt, who thus won his own game,
were the specific reasons for the
crash. In their half, Righter's men
were given a chance to win when
Holmes was hit by a pitched ball and
Deffenbach walked. Loewenstein
made the third out, however, by flying
to right*. The third inning brought
more results. Woodward opened with
a single to left and was advanced on
Coulter's timely hit. Reese flew out
to right. Colvin then brought Wood
ward in when the opposition failed on
a fielder's choice. A chance to make
more runs was lost when Smurr and
Strong struck out.
Loewenstein held California well in
hand for the -next five innings.
Meanwhile, Stanford lost another good
chance to catch up in the fifth. Coul
ter opened with another hit and stole
second. Reese went out, short to first,
and Colvin succeeded in dumping a
bunt along the first base line with
out getting put oufi With two men
on bases, Heidt retired the next two
batters via the strike-out and grounder
routes.
The sixth was a little better. Def
fenbach walked and stole second.
Loewenstein drove him in with a single
to center. Heidt tightened up again
I and Woodward was out on a grounder
|to first, Coulter following with a
1 strike-out.
Two "hits in the seventh counted for
nothing. Reese singled to left, but
j was out stealing. Colvin singled, but
! Smurr hit into a double play, ending
the inning. The eighth was 110 better,
j Holmes hit safely to right and stole
j second, but was out, short to third,
on the next play. The last faint hope
' was smothered in the ninth. Wood
ward struck out and Coulter flew to
! second. Reese started what looked
i like might be a rally, by a single to
| center, but Colvin could do nothing
1 and grounded out, second to first.
California broke loose'- with one
I marker in the eighth. An error by
! Colvin, followed by a single to center
1 and a fly tb the same place, were all
! that were made. This was just a
1 sample, however of the ninth, when
the Blue freshmen spiked the
, plate three times more and called it
a day. Hourinan sapped a hard one
into left. Two errors by Woodward,
and two more singles were sufficient
cause for what happened. Holmes
; ended the procession when he caught
; the last two men trying to steal.
