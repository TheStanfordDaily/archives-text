# OF WHAT GOOD IS A CARNIVAL?
## 
### 
Many-men about the University whose opinions are always accepted
with respect believe that there can be no good in a student carnival?
From a student viewpoint there is in the gala event /this year the distinct
advantage that provides a way to help finance the eastern trips of the
track and tennis teams, which might not be possible without its aid.
We notice that many universities- have associated student parties or
other social functions which all members of the Student body may at
tend in the atmosphere of an all-university event. A. S. S. U. parties
have not been a part of our Stanford democracy, and in the present
calendar the carnival is the only function which permits of the associa
tion of all students at one pleasurable occasion.
The result of planning attd conducting an all-university event
on an all-student-body basis as is the carnival, which is made possible
only by close cooperation of the varied living groups and campus or
ganizations, should tend in the direction of a closer feeling and under
standing between the members and groups bf the Stanford community.
Some may look with question on the student'carnival because of the
general evolution which such functions often follow. It seems that
circuses and similar productions of a number of other universities/iavc
at times tended to deteriorate from year to year until it became
sary to abolish them because of general unwholesome character. Tne
purpose of the present carnival committee is to sec that such a trend
is not taken by the Stanford carnival, but that it is made productive of
every good that is possible of such an all-university function.
