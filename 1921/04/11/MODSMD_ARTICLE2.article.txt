# MARGARET LIES AND DELLA TAYLOR CLOSE IN RACE FOR QUEEN
## 
### 
Margaret Lies, '23 and Delia Taylor
'23, are running a close race for the
queenly honors in the Carnival. Miss
Lies is slightly the favorite, but it looks
like a close battle "will develop tomor
row morning before the closing of the
polls at 12:15. Voting has been slow
today, and rumor has it that the rival
camps are holding their trumps in the
hole to spring at the last minute of the
contest.
Joe Mtttphy maintains his lead in the
front Â«f the aspirants for the posses
sion of the royal wand. His lead is
now so great that the chances of any
of his opponents seem slim at best.
The finale of the King and Queen
contest comes tomorrow at 12:15 when
the polls will close and the royalty will
be declared elected. They will be
crowncd the first night of the Carnival.
