Pygmalion Scores Big Success
Well, we'll have to hand it to the
Renaissance Club, for they sure did
offer some snappy little entertain
ment Saturday night in the form of
Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion."* Every
part was admirably cast and every
individual so well fitted to his char
acter. That was a slick play and we
offer it as a precedent to campus
theatrical clubs. We even forgot the
crude stage settings in the face of
the clever acting and dialogue that
1
was given us.
Noted Artists Soon in Play
Those from Los Angeles may be in
terested in knowing that the boy that
took part of the father, Alfred Doo
little, is Lloyd Corrigan, son of the
famous Corrigans have played in
the Morosco Stock company for years.
He is certainly well 011 his way to be
fully as famous a character actor as
either of his parents.
1922, Rah!
Say, this Junior Opera, is going to
be a knock-out, just look over the list
of chorus ladies and tell me if you
don't think so. The chorus men. too,
could be worse.
Ted Shawn to Visit Campus
Now, the next thing to look for
ward to that we'll have to buy tickets
for is the Ruth St. Denis-Ted Shawn
program on the twenty-first of April.
By the way, Ted Shawn is visiting the
campus tomorrow, we see, and will
talk to Gordon Davis' class in The
atrical Workshop in the 'Assembly
Hall at 2:00 o'clock. ,
