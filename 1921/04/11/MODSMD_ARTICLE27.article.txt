# VARSITY SWIMMERS WILL MEET OLYMPIC CLUB TEAM TUESDAY
## 
### 
T he varsity swimming squad will meet
the Olympic Club junior swimming team
tomorrow night at the Olympic club
tank. In doing so, they will be going
up against some of the stiffest cotnpe
tion. available, and chances to win do
not look very bright. The Olympic
Club has an exceptionally strong out
fit in its junior squad and lias proven
its ability before. The big star in their
swimming constellation is Lester Smith,
who, although still in the junior class
of swimmers, holds the Pacific Coast
records for the 50, 100, and 220-yard
dashes. Perhaps the most interesting
races of the evening will be between
Smith and Austin, who has been swim
ming in very good time lately.
