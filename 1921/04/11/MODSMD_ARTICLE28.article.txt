"Good morning, Glory. Would you
care to look over our line of iron pan
sies or lace soup ladles—or perhaps an
autographed' edition of a *work just
published in San Francisco would in
terest you."
"Thank you, no. I've been around
college long enough to learn that noth
ing interesting is ever put between the
covers of a book."
"But this book is like the Theta Delt
color scheme, it's different. Being a
co-ed, of course you aren't interested in
dancing, but here is dancing MADE in
teresting. It's all about Ruth St. Denis
and her cycle of Oriental dances, and
as a piece of literary style it has some
wonderful illustrations."
Now, gentle reader, the even gentler
reporter will softly break the news to
you. The above soul stirring scene rep
resents what might very easily take
place in the Bookstore during the next
few days. They have on exhibition over
there, at nothing per look, a two volume
special edition called "Ruth St. Denis—
Pioneer and Prophet."

and if he could wield as wicked a line
in his courting days as he can now we
don't blame Ruth for marrying him.
The second volume is given over en
tirely to photographs and it has the fam
ily album beaten all hollow. The edi
tion is limited to 250 copies.
Despite its elaborateness, however,
"notable economies, such as a pasteboard
binding, have been effected and the two
volumes can be had for the extremely
reasonable price of forty dollars (Don't
crowd, there are plenty left.
