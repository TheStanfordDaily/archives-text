# THIRTY-EIGHT TO ENTER SHOWS IN FIESTA PROGRAM
## Free Entertainment Promises Variety Numbers; Athletic Acts and Comedy Mapped 
### 
Thirty-eight organization groups have
entered the Carnival and will have con
cessions of some kind, either shows or
control of certain functions such as the
disposal of progress, tickets, and pea
nuts. Practically every organization on
the campus has entered in some way
to back the Fiesta.
Probably the largest concession of the
Carnival will be the Ram's Head offer
ing. They are controlling the enter
tainment for the evening, and the tal
ented troup of male comedians will per
form at intervals, at different places
around the festival enclosure. A num
ber of acts have been included in the
Ram's Head program, which not only
includes the regular comedy skits for
which the organization is famous, but
in addition has specialty gymnastic, and
athletic performances to offer through
the Courtesy of members of the gymna
sium teams. Russ Sewall is in charge
of of the free entertainment, and has
the assistance of C. S. Botsford of the
Gymnasium department in regard to the
shows that include the athletic talent.
The biggest individual part of the
evening comes at the close of the con
cessions when in connection with the
Ram's Head final show there will be a
chorus of 50 charming women intro
duced, and the big informal catch-as
catch-can dance will begin. This is one
of the most important features of the
Carnival and promises to furnish a good
time for all. It is given primarily for
the single men at the Fiesta. The wom
en will appear attractively gowned in
modish Spanish creations, and at the
conclusion of the chorus will leave the
stage and be ready for dancing with
the timid gentlemen. The dance need
hold no fear for the frightened shrink
ing rough because the women will not
only be there to dance, but will solicit
partners for the grand perambulation.
There will be no introductions, and
none will be needed. This is to be one
place where one can get by on his face,
or crust, take your chance. Dancing
will continue from the closing of the
concessions until 12 or 1 o'clock.
Hammer and Coffin is editing the
programs, and promises to make up a
sheet that will make the funniest of
the famous "Chappie" look like an evan
gelistist's hymnal. The fair members of
Theta Sigma Phi will attend to the
dissemination of the programs.

the timid gentlemen. The dance need
hold no fear for the frightened shrink

partners for the grand perambulation.
There will be no introductions, and
none will be needed. This is to be one
place where one can get by on his face,

will continue from the closing of the
concessions until 12 or 1 o'clock.

Thirty-eight organization groups have
entered the Carnival and will have con
cessions of some kind, either shows or
control of certain functions such as the
disposal of progress, tickets, and pea
nuts. Practically every organization on
the campus has entered in some way
to back the Fiesta.
Probably the largest concession of the
Carnival will be the Ram's Head offer
ing. They are controlling the enter
tainment for the evening, and the tal
ented troup of male comedians will per
form at intervals, at different places
around the festival enclosure. A num
ber of acts have been included in the
Ram's Head program, which not only
includes the regular comedy skits for
which the organization is famous, but
in addition has specialty gymnastic, and
athletic performances to offer through
the Courtesy of members of the gymna
sium teams. Russ Sewall is in charge
of of the free entertainment, and has
the assistance of C. S. Botsford of the
Gymnasium department in regard to the
shows that include the athletic talent.
The biggest individual part of the
evening comes at the close of the con
cessions when in connection with the
Ram's Head final show there will be a
chorus of 50 charming women intro
duced, and the big informal catch-as
catch-can dance will begin. This is one
of the most important features of the
Carnival and promises to furnish a good
time for all. It is given primarily for
the single men at the Fiesta. The wom
en will appear attractively gowned in
modish Spanish creations, and at the
conclusion of the chorus will leave the
stage and be ready for dancing with
the timid gentlemen. The dance need
