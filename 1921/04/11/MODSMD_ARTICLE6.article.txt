# YEARLINGS WIN TENNIS
## Four of Five Matches Fall Before Captain Hinckley's Net Aggregation 
### 
Stanford's freshman court stars tri
umphed over California's first year men,
winning four out of five matches, in
the 1921 title tennis tournament at
Berkeley, Saturday. The Cardinal
players were victorious in all three
singles, and broke even in the doubles.
Richard Hinckley, 24, Stanford cap
tain, outclassed the leading Bruin op
ponent, R. Vinson, in every department
of the game. Hinckley was playing in
fine form, and started in by using a
powerful drive on the sphere. However,
before the first set was half completed,
the Card leader changed his pace, using
the high-bounding back-court drive, and
a short chop-stroke with even greater
effectiveness. Vison had trouble in
handling Hinckley's service which found
the far corners regularly. The scores
were 6-3, 6-2.
The closest and hardest-fought match
of the tournament was the second
singles between Ted Mertz of Stanford's
yearlings and E. Vinson of California,
Mertz got off to a slow start in the
first set losing four out of six games,
but finally lightened up, taking the next
four games and the set. In the second
period Vinson volleyed too consistently
for Mertz, winning at 7-5. The odd set
was characterized by steady driving on
the part of each player, with the ad
vantage slightly in favor of the Bruin
racquct artist, until the score stood 4-3.

Mertz evened matters by taking Vin
son s serve. The following two games
and the match were annexed by the
Stanford net man.
A clean sweep for the Cardinal' babes
was made in the singles matches when
Norman De Bach defeated Del Radkc,
Blue and Gold captain. Dc Beach's
steady chop-stroke was largely respon
sible for two straight sets to his credit.
Hinckley and De Beach, playing first
doubles for Stanford, proved to be far
superior to the Vinson brothers. The
visitors lost only three games in two
sets, showing a brand of team-work,
which was worthy of varsity competi
tion.
California gained her lone match in
the second doubles. Radke and Carson
were a bit too strong for Mannoccir and
Leeds. Although both teams were play
ing their strokes with about even suc
cess near the end of the first period.
The Bcrkcleyans managed to capture a
pair of straight sets. ,
