# POPULAR PUGILIST AND BLUSHING BEAUTY WILL WIELD THE "BASTON REAL"
## Coronation Is Friday Evening at Opening of Carnival Night; Will Lead Revelers 
### W. C. Evans, '22 
Joe Murphy, carrier of one of the prettiest rights in the near and far,
today clinched the title to the royal cane with 40,381 votes, to 31,637 for
Phillips. Joe opened his fight in the second round after the gong had 1
given the decision of the first day to his opponent, but in the following
periods exhibited a brand of punch ad neat foot work in sidestepping the
reporters that placed him among the foremost of the Reyes Mundi (Latin
for kings of note).
With him as side-kick and second will be the charming Margaret Lies.
She took the title with a 1500 majority af the finfSh. Miss Lies has been
a favorite through the entire race for honors in the Fiesta and will make
a princess who might well be measured in the standards of the stately
Queen Anne herself, or perhaps alongside of the far-famed beauty of Marie

Antoinette. Just as Marie held dow
11 the left side of the royal two-seated
carriage of Napoleon in the triumpha
lit march through the Parisian Mardi
Gras, in the same manner and with
even better adornment will Miss Lies
lend queenly grace to the joyous pro
cession after the frowning of the
King and Queen.
Murphy Well Qualified
Murphy has all the qualifications
that could be possibly desired for a
regent to rule the turbulent mob that
will crowd the inner ground in the
Fiesta. In regard to threatened usur
pations of his honors in the evening of
triumph, one of his secretaries made
the statement, "Joe won his fight the
other day with only a pair of light
weight pillows on his fists. Let any
ono try pyrooting around when he
has a nice length of decorated car
track in his hand. Go 'way lassies,
not a prayer."
Miss Lies Calm
When told of her elevation to the
legal wagon of fame Miss Lies ac
customed aplomb and unbreakable
serenity. She has not made an active
campaign for her nomination, being
simply contest to sit back and take it
easy with the knowledge that her
uaHiral grace and comeliness, not to
speak of the purse provided by the
campaign managers, would insure her
a title seat in the chariot. With per
fect sweetness and modesty of mein
she was heard to remark when noti
fied of the acclamation to office: "I
am the servant of the people and if
the popular demand lias cried for me
to be their Joan of Ark I can only bow
my head to fate and accede to their
pleadings."

not a prayer."
Miss Lies Calm
When told of her elevation to the
legal wagon of fame Miss Lies ac
customed aplomb and unbreakable
serenity. She has not made an active
campaign for her nomination, being
simply contest to sit back and take it
easy with the knowledge that her
uaHiral grace and comeliness, not to
speak of the purse provided by the
campaign managers, would insure her
a title seat in the chariot. With per
fect sweetness and modesty of mein
she was heard to remark when noti
fied of the acclamation to office: "I
am the servant of the people and if
the popular demand lias cried for me
to be their Joan of Ark I can only bow
my head to fate and accede to their
pleadings."
Coronation is Friday
The royal installation will be Fri
day night at the opening of the Fiesta,
in the court at th end of the main
street of concessions. Costumes from
a prominent designer of Madrid have
been secured and also Court clothes
for a regal assemblage, that will form
a colorful and interesting background
I for the coronation program.
Joe Murphy, carrier of one of the prettiest rights in the near and far,
today clinched the title to the royal cane with 40,381 votes, to 31,637 for
Phillips. Joe opened his fight in the second round after the gong had 1
given the decision of the first day to his opponent, but in the following
periods exhibited a brand of punch ad neat foot work in sidestepping the
reporters that placed him among the foremost of the Reyes Mundi (Latin
for kings of note).
With him as side-kick and second will be the charming Margaret Lies.
She took the title with a 1500 majority af the finfSh. Miss Lies has been
a favorite through the entire race for honors in the Fiesta and will make
a princess who might well be measured in the standards of the stately
Queen Anne herself, or perhaps alongside of the far-famed beauty of Marie

Antoinette. Just as Marie held dow
11 the left side of the royal two-seated
carriage of Napoleon in the triumpha
lit march through the Parisian Mardi
Gras, in the same manner and with
even better adornment will Miss Lies
lend queenly grace to the joyous pro
cession after the frowning of the
King and Queen.
Murphy Well Qualified
Murphy has all the qualifications
that could be possibly desired for a
regent to rule the turbulent mob that
will crowd the inner ground in the
Fiesta. In regard to threatened usur
pations of his honors in the evening of
triumph, one of his secretaries made
the statement, "Joe won his fight the
other day with only a pair of light
weight pillows on his fists. Let any
ono try pyrooting around when he
has a nice length of decorated car
track in his hand. Go 'way lassies,
not a prayer."
