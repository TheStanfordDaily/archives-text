# SWIMMERS MEET OLYMPICS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's swimming team will face
the Olympic Club mermen tonight in
San Francisco in the first off-campus
meet of the season. A large squad will
he taken up by Coach Brandsten and
Stanford will have a number of entries
in every event. P
This year's swimming team has been
hard hit by the faculty axe, and several
members of last year's squad are inel
igible for inter-collegiate competition
this quarter. Coach Brandsten with a
fair turnout, however, has developed a
balanced squad which should make a
good showing this season.
One, of the features of the meet to
night will be the dash events in which
Captain Darling and Jim Austin will
compete against Smith of the Olympic
team. Austin has shown a big im
provement over his work last year and
should give the Olympic dash man a
close race. Goddard will be entered in
the diving events while Sparling should
place well up among the leaders in the
breast stroke.
The following members of the squad
have been asked to report at the Book
store at 6:30 o'clock tonight prepared to
make the"'trip: Captain Darling, Mac
connell, Austin, Thomas, Fehren, Stern,
â€¢Sparling, Schlaudeman, Wilbur, Miller,
Kennedy, Land is, Goddard, Laeey, Cuti
dall, Krantizthar, Dorland, Welsh, An
