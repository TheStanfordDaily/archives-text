will be picked to meet the Blue;, and
Gold racqueters in the inter-collegiate
tournament to he staged on the Stan
ford courts Saturday. The contestants
on the squad have been lowered In five
players and these are going at their
best in order to retain tluir position
and to be in top form for the meet.
After three weeks of inter-squad
matches which have been staged to de
termine to some extent, the rating of
the individual players, Jim Davies, '22,
Berry Fish, '2.1, Skee Turner, 21, Cap
tain Phil Neer, '22, and Ford fussing,
'22, have displayed the best tennis in
the competitive matches and the squad
which will go against California will
be picked from the five named.
Noticeable improvement in. the style
and strokes of the members of the
squad leaves no doubt but what tin
team should be at its best after the
final practice matches. Berry Fish,
member of the varsity squad for three
seasons is an old head at tournament
play and will iHtcr a strung bid for a
singles victory should be retain his
place in the final tryouts.
Captain Phil Neer is rounding into
shape and is playing his usual steady
game which has been a stumbling block
for many in past tournaments. Neer
was hindered to an extent in the early
part of the season, due to a wrenched
knee received in basketball. Skee Tur
ner lias shown a big improvement over
his past work and is a very strong
contender for a place on the squad,
which will face the Bruins Saturday.
Jim Davies will be playing bis best
