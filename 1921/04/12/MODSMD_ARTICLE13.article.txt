## Competitive Practice for Meet Next Saturday to Continue Until Tomorrow Afternoon 
### 
I lie varsity tennis squad vvill con
tinue competitive praeetice this week
up until Wednesday night when a Irani
will be picked to meet the Blue;, and
Gold racqueters in the inter-collegiate
tournament to he staged on the Stan
ford courts Saturday. The contestants
on the squad have been lowered In five
players and these are going at their
best in order to retain tluir position
and to be in top form for the meet.
After three weeks of inter-squad
matches which have been staged to de
termine to some extent, the rating of
the individual players, Jim Davies, '22,
Berry Fish, '2.1, Skee Turner, 21, Cap
tain Phil Neer, '22, and Ford fussing,
'22, have displayed the best tennis in
the competitive matches and the squad
which will go against California will
be picked from the five named.
Noticeable improvement in. the style
and strokes of the members of the
squad leaves no doubt but what tin
team should be at its best after the
final practice matches. Berry Fish,
member of the varsity squad for three
seasons is an old head at tournament
play and will iHtcr a strung bid for a
singles victory should be retain his
place in the final tryouts.
Captain Phil Neer is rounding into
shape and is playing his usual steady
game which has been a stumbling block
for many in past tournaments. Neer
was hindered to an extent in the early
part of the season, due to a wrenched
knee received in basketball. Skee Tur
ner lias shown a big improvement over
his past work and is a very strong
contender for a place on the squad,
which will face the Bruins Saturday.
Jim Davies will be playing bis best
game by Saturday, and will give either
Hates or Levy, the California stars, a
real contest for his match. Davies has
been pounding the small pellet into
the deep and out of the way corners
of the court by well placed drives and
a fast chop, which has a tendency to
slip by his opponent at all angles. His
match against the California stars will
be a feature of the contest against the
Bruin court artists Saturday and his
pluck as displayed on the basketball
court will out weight the advantage of
visitors in early season experience.
Ford Tussing has shown perhaps the
most improvement on the squad this
season. His change from a rather
soft and ineffective placement game to
a hard hitting net attack has increased
the effectiveness of his strokes and has
made his offensive play a positive fac
tor.
Wallace Bates. Ed Levy and the
other Bruin court representatives, who
will invade the Stanford campus are
all experienced men and it will take
the hardest type of plugging to stow
away the majority of the matches. The
tournament will consist of three sin
gles and two doubles. The matches
will he started promptly at 10 o'clock
to allow the fans ample time to see
the events following.
