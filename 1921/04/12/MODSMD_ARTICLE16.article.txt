# OUR TRAINING SYSTEM
## 
### 
Stanford's best athletes were developed on the Stanford campus.
The success of Cardinal teams has been due to consistent progress after
registration in the University, not to recognized ability before that time.
Coach "Dink" Templeton, in the April Illustrated Review, explains
how championship teams were built before the war, and incidentally
shows how we must proceed to develop the same hard-fighting combi
nations for the future.
Tha coach says in part: "Somewhere during the war period and
immediately following it the Stanford track-training system, which had
proven so long to be a winner, was shot to pieces. . . . The few good
athletes that were here had to carry us over in every line of sport, and
the idea grew that a track man was born and not made, and that if he
was, the thing to do was to train easy, work light, and save everything
for the big meet. As a consequence we have developed few men, and
our teams have been carried along by the before-the-war stars who re
turned to college. *
'"Hie history of such famous Stanford track stars as Murray. Nor
ton, Aupperle, MorrisKirksey, and Jess Wells" [and we might add R. L.
Templeton] "and many others, shows the fallacy of such a system. Who
ever heard of them before they came to Stanford? It is plain that work
made stars of them. Their greatest assets were enthusiasm and determi
nation."
The words of the coach mean a great ileal. Stanford's champion
ship teams of the future must be produced by a return to the real pre
war system by which active participation of all-or a great number of reg
istered students made possible the building of many valuable athletes.
If a hundred sophomore huskies turn out for spring football practice,
the success of the gridiron team two years hence should be assured.
