### 
Miss Dorothea Spinney, a well
known English rc&der of international
reputation, will present the old Greek
play, Alccstis, by Euripides, Wednes
day evening in the Little Theater tin
dec the auspices of the committee on
Public Exerciscs and the Classical
Club.
Miss- Spinney gives her interpreta
tion*. of the drama without stage ac
cessories, portraying all the characters
and individualizing them by voice and
manner. Her programs in London,
Edinburgh, Scotland, and before clas

sical associations in England have al
ways caused commendatory notices.
Of English she was brought
up in a classical atmosphere and in
England first acquired a reputation as
a reader, and especially as an interpre
ter of the classics. Her first trip to
this country was made several years
ago, and since that time she has ap
peared at most of the leading colleges
and universities of the United States.
The play of Euripides, although one
of the less-known of that author, has
a theme of universal interest which is
treated with rare truth and sincerity.
Alcestis, the wife of Admetus, in or
der to provide %for her husband's liv
ing after the day fixed for his death,
sacrifices herself, as no one else is
willing. After her sacrifice, however,
Heracles rescues her from the lower
world and restores her to life.
