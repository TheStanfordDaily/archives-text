# DR. FRANK M. MACFARLAND IS ORGANIZER OF PRESENT HOPKINS MARINE STATION
## 
### 
Dr. Frank M. MacFarland, head of
the Pre-Medical department of the
Stanford Medical School, was born in
Centralia, 111., June 10, 1869, and at
tended the public schools there. He
took his Ph. D. degree from Depauw
University, Indiana, in 1889, and for
the next three years was Professor of
Biology and Geology at Olivet College,
Michigan.
In 1892 Dr. came to
Stanford as- a graduate student and
teaching assistant in Physiology and
Histology, taking his A. M., in 1893.
For a year he was Instructor jn His
tology and in 1894 Assistant Professor
of Histology. During the next two
years he took a leave of absence and
studied in Europe, taking up work in
Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. It
was at this time that he laid a broad
basis for research work which has
taken up all of his time not given to
actual work in the department. He
was a student at the Universities of
Zurich and Wurzburg, taking his Ph.
D. from the latter in 1896.
From 1897 to 1909 he was Associate
Professor of Histology at Stanford
and since that time has been professor
of histology with full charge of pre
medical students before they go to
San Francisco to take up their clinical
work. Because of the limited number
admitted to graduate work in the
Medical School the task of choosing
the students to go on to clinical work
is an extremely difficult one. Dr. Mac-
Farland is Chairman of the Committee
on Academic Matters which represents
the Dean of the Medical School in all
matters connected with the students
before they leave for the city. The
restricted numbers and the peculiar
nature of the work which is largely in
the laboratories with few, lectures
aif opportunity for intimate acquaint
ance with every student ni the de
partment. The high standard required
by the department and the fact that
many students are naturally infiteed
for the work make it necessary for
all sympathies to be disregarded in

decisions, and this adds to the dif-1
ficulty of the work.
In 1902 Dr. MacFarland was married
to Olive K. Hornbrook, a Stanford
graduate, and the next year was spent
in European travel and study. The
work this time included research study
at the Zoological Station, Naples, Italy.
At present they live on the hill back
of the campus and Dr. MacFarland
takes great delight in gardening. He
does not mind in the least to be called
a "garden crank." Hia life is at one
with his work and after the manner
of men who accomplish things, he
make little noise about it. His friend
ly mnile and manner remove all ques
tion as to the eflect which steady ap
plication of study and research work
have had on him —he is entirely human
and has a fund of experience which
savors of versatility and interest.
From 1915 to 1917 Dr. MacFarland
worked with Professor C. H. Gilbert
in remodeling the organization of *fhe
Hopkins Marine Station. They chose
a new site for the laboratory on Al
meja Point, Monterey Bay, and de
signed the new building for the sta
tion. The work at the Station was
conducted apart from that of the Uni
versity until Dr. Wilbur became presi
dent and it was then that it was re
organized by Dr. MaeFarland and put
on a different basis! becoming a reg
ular department the University.
The work of the station is urimarily
for scientific investigation, both by
regular students and other men who
come from ifferent parts fo the world.
He has written many scientifc papers
on Cytological, and Zool
ogical subjects. These have already
represented the results of his years
of research and could be termed the
"star dust from his workshop."
Dr. MacFarland read the Daily Palo
Alto when it was hard just to find a
press. For a time it was printed at
Redwood City and distributed from
there. At this same time there were
two fences to climb over on the foot
path (which is now Palm Drive) be
tween' Palo Alto and the Campus.

does not mind in the least to be called
a "garden crank." Hia life is at one

of men who accomplish things, he
make little noise about it. His friend

From 1915 to 1917 Dr. MacFarland
worked with Professor C. H. Gilbert
in remodeling the organization of *fhe
Hopkins Marine Station. They chose
a new site for the laboratory on Al
meja Point, Monterey Bay, and de
signed the new building for the sta
tion. The work at the Station was
conducted apart from that of the Uni
versity until Dr. Wilbur became presi
dent and it was then that it was re
organized by Dr. MaeFarland and put
on a different basis! becoming a reg
ular department the University.
The work of the station is urimarily
for scientific investigation, both by
regular students and other men who
come from ifferent parts fo the world.
He has written many scientifc papers
on Cytological, and Zool
ogical subjects. These have already
represented the results of his years
of research and could be termed the
"star dust from his workshop."
Dr. MacFarland read the Daily Palo
Alto when it was hard just to find a
press. For a time it was printed at
Redwood City and distributed from
there. At this same time there were
two fences to climb over on the foot
path (which is now Palm Drive) be
tween' Palo Alto and the Campus.
Dr. Frank M. MacFarland, head of
the Pre-Medical department of the
Stanford Medical School, was born in
Centralia, 111., June 10, 1869, and at
tended the public schools there. He
took his Ph. D. degree from Depauw
University, Indiana, in 1889, and for
the next three years was Professor of
Biology and Geology at Olivet College,
Michigan.
In 1892 Dr. came to
Stanford as- a graduate student and
teaching assistant in Physiology and
Histology, taking his A. M., in 1893.
For a year he was Instructor jn His
tology and in 1894 Assistant Professor
of Histology. During the next two
years he took a leave of absence and
studied in Europe, taking up work in
Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. It
was at this time that he laid a broad
basis for research work which has
taken up all of his time not given to
actual work in the department. He
was a student at the Universities of
Zurich and Wurzburg, taking his Ph.
D. from the latter in 1896.
From 1897 to 1909 he was Associate
Professor of Histology at Stanford
and since that time has been professor
of histology with full charge of pre
medical students before they go to
San Francisco to take up their clinical
work. Because of the limited number
admitted to graduate work in the
Medical School the task of choosing
the students to go on to clinical work
is an extremely difficult one. Dr. Mac-
Farland is Chairman of the Committee
on Academic Matters which represents
the Dean of the Medical School in all
matters connected with the students
before they leave for the city. The
restricted numbers and the peculiar
nature of the work which is largely in
the laboratories with few, lectures
aif opportunity for intimate acquaint
ance with every student ni the de
partment. The high standard required
by the department and the fact that
many students are naturally infiteed
for the work make it necessary for
all sympathies to be disregarded in

decisions, and this adds to the dif-1
ficulty of the work.
In 1902 Dr. MacFarland was married
to Olive K. Hornbrook, a Stanford
graduate, and the next year was spent
in European travel and study. The
work this time included research study
at the Zoological Station, Naples, Italy.
At present they live on the hill back
of the campus and Dr. MacFarland
takes great delight in gardening. He
