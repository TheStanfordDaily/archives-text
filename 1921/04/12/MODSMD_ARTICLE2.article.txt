# NEW ENCINA TENNIS COURTS BEING BUILT
## 
### 
Stanford will have two of the beat
tennis courts on the Pacific Coast at
the completion of the new asphalt
courts near Encina Gymnasium. Work
has been pushed during the last few
weeks and under the direction of an
expert, the courts will be in shape for
use in a short time.
The courts will cost close to $1650
each, and are of carefully graded
asphalt. Following the laying of the .
asphalt, permanent grandstands of a
large seating capacity will be built.
Evergreen shrubbery of attractive
landscape design will surround the
courts. One of the features of the
new courts will be an improved drain
age system.
The present courts will be torn up
with the completion of the new
courts to make way for the basket
ball pavilion and work will be started i
upon ten courts to be constructed be-1
tween the varsity courts and the En-j
cina eating clubs. These courts are
to bo finished before the end of the
present quarter according to the pres
ent building plan.
The two new courts are to be re
served for Varsity use while the
courts near the eating clubs are to be
used in intramural tennis. These
courts are the first steps toward a
bigger athletic field movement in ten
nis and are a part of Dr. Browne's j
plan of building 90 tennis courts at j
Stanford in the next six years.
