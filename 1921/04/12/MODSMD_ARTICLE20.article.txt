# Sporty "Avro" is Assured to Fly During Carnival
## 
### 
Barney Dqolin.* well known aviator,
will fly bis British Avro plane for the
two days of the Spring Carnival from
the Stanford Polo field. He has made
with the Carnival Commit
tee whereby be gives the major part of
the proceeds from his flights to the
benefit of the Carnival. On account of
rules of the Bay Regions aeroplane pi
lots he cannot fly for lrss than' ten dol
lars per flight, but will give exceeding
ly long flights each time to make up
fort he seeming steepness in price.
The Avro which is in perfect shape
is one of the latest of biplanes. It is
equipped with a powerful Le Royne
rotary motor and is an ideal ship for
stunting. The extremity of the dihe
dral in the machine makes it practically
fool-proof, and it will right itself from
any position. Those who desire added
thrills and altitude flights will be able
to satisfy their craving by the payment
of a nominal extra payment.
Tickets for the flights are being rat'
fled in advance at the various 19 living
and eating groups. Regular tickets may
be procured from the Carnival commit
tee or on Uie field the days of flying.
The tickets are being raffled off at a
dollar a chance.
