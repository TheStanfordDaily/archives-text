The King is here! Long Live the
King! The Boxer's Rebellion must
have been a success judging by' the
neatness and despatch with which the
present rule's cohort raffled off last

Sing a song o' Kampus King
Pocketful to vote;
Four and twenty roughnecks

tell second-hand ladies and gents when
you see 'em. Every time we look at
that ad we see a new wonder in it.
There's two more we didn't mention.
We saw one yesterday that went —
"Kelly Cords! Some Tires!" We're
curious to know what the rest of 'em
are.
