## 
### 
Appearing on the Quad tomorrow
morning for-sale, the April issue of
The Cardinal is marked by its wade
range of appeal. Including an extract
from the autobiography of David Starr
Jordan, an article by Professor W. G.
Beach on the Crime Wave, stories by
Archie Binns, Warren Lewis and Carl
Wilhelmson, and an analysis of stu
dent efforts to bluff their professors,
the April Cardinal is a well-balanced
number.
Can you bluff your way to 180 cre
dits? A well-known student body
ieader who for obvious reasons has
withheld his name answers the ques
tion In the forthcoming issue. The
sensational has been avoided by the
writer, but a scprch'ng, analysis of
present classroom methods is made
which reaches disquieting conclu
sions.
Undoubtedly the best series of short
stories contained ill any one issue this
year appear in the April number. The
retiring editor of The Cardinal, Binns.
and the new editor, Lewis, both con
tribute The appearance of
Puth Si. Denis on the campus next
week will lend interest to a photo
graph of h*>r which The Cardinal this
month publishes.
