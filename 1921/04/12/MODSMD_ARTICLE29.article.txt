# PIONEER MATERIAL GIVEN TO MUSEUM BY LOCAL CURATOR
## 
### 
A number of interesting additions
have recently been made to the col
lection at the University Museum.
Among them are three which are
worthy of special note.
The first is a specimen of petrified
wood, unearthed from the Bad Lands
of Alberta, Canada. Many prehistoric
fossils have been unearthed in this
part of the continent and shipped to
part of the continent and shipped to
the various museums and art galleries
all over the world. The specimen is
a gift from John E. Gustus of Calgary-
Canada, father of Edwin Lysle Gustus,
'21, a student In the chemistry depart
ment here. Much effort was made to
retain the wood in the locality where
it was discovered and it was mainly
because of the fact that his son is at
tending Stanford that Mr. Gustus sent

the specimen to the local museum.
The second addition comes from
Mrs. Frank Reeves, formerly Miss
Dorothy Hume, a graduate of Stan
ford. Her contribution is ,a large
painting entitled "The Bull Fight" and
was originally a gift to Mrs. Iteeves'
grandfather from Mrs. Stanford. It
has a double significance, therefore,
in being worthy of a place in the Uni
versity museum.
A collection of early American pio
neer material has been presented to
the Pioneer Room of the museum, by
Mrs. Oldroyd, curator of the shell col
lection in the geology department. It
contain* a camplete set of portrait
specimens, showing the development
of photography from the days of the
silhouette and daguerrotype, up
through the progressive steps in the
history of photographs. The collec
tion also contains samples of spec
tacles and eye-glasses back to the
square-rimmed types of pioneer days.
Several candle molds, and a number
of samples of early textiles complete
the gift of Mrs. Oldroyd.
