# Equitation Class Is Organized for Faculty Members
## 
### 
Whoa! If you see a foaming steed
with a bare-headed "Prof" in riding
breeches galloping wildly down Lagu
nita-way, grab the bridle i. e. the
horse's. He's cutting class.
The Faculty Hiding Class, recently
organized with fifteen members, held
its first meeting yesterday. Major
Collins is in charge of the class which
will meet on Manday, Wednesday and
Friday, from 1:30 to 3:00 p.m. All
faculty members and their wives are
invited to join.
