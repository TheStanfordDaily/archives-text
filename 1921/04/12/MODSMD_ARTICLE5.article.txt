Oyes! Guardese el torb! Cuidado!
Suba cti los arboles! Aqui viene cl
animalucho diablo! That's all right Ed
win, its the prize Andalusian bull se
cured by Skull and Snakes for the giant
bull fight that is being staged by the
society for the carnival. At great ex
pense this fine animal has been secured
from the neighboring stock farm and
will be the chief contender in the
struggle of some of the champioi) bull
throwers of the vicinity, when they will
enter in mortal combat with this fierce
denizen of the Southern mountains of
Spain. Â»
Animal to be Enraged for Battle
For three days before the Fiesta be
ginning tomorrow, the animal will be
fed nothing but raw meat and will be
taunted by keeping it away from wa
ter, and constant nagging with fire
brands, and burrs. Skull and Snakes
has secured theg services, of Senor
T'Alert, who admits himself that he can
throw more bulls in a minute than a
Lewis machine gun can bullets in two
hours. He is a native ni the country
where the children play with spears and
piciideros instead of rattles and paci
fiers, and he eats garlic and gun pow
der and drinks nothing but red ink.
When approached as to the possibility
of coming to the campus to give the
public a chance to sec his display, he
consented only on the condition that a
real bull of the genus Andalusia be pro
cured for him. A search was instituted
for miles around, extending clear into
the stock country of the San Joaquin
Valley and the enormous cattle regions
there. At last an animal was secured
at a staggering price that consented to N
come up here and be slaughtered for
the enlightenment of those who have
never seen a Hull Fight, such as is
pulled off in Madrid instead of the
Sunday ball games that draw the
crowds to the Polo Grounds in New
York.
Almia O's to Furnish Atmosphf.rf.
Alpha O will furnish the lively latin
atmosphere with cigarette girls, and
fair vendors of sweet-meats and choic
est dainties. Artistically dressed as
maidens of the older Spain where at
the watering places of the Mediterran
ean seashore, the girls pass slowly
through the crowds with their baskets
of candies and sugared fruits, the young
women will offer their wares to the
joyous revelers, in much the same man
ner of the flower girls who pin the
fragrant buds and wish the pleasant
"Wya con Dios" to the purchaser at the
same time.
