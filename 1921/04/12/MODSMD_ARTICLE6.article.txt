# SANTA CLARA TO MEET CARDINAL HERE TOMORROW
## Nef and Green Will Start the Game With Rest of Team Same As Last Saturday 
### 
The Cardinal nine will meet the
Santa Clara aggregation for the second
time this season when the two teams
take positions on the local diamond
tomorrow afternoon. Nef and Green
are likely to start the game with
Kelly in reserve for the mound posi
tion. The rest of the lineup will work
the same as in the game with Cali
fornia last Saturday.
Patterson at first and Heckendorf
in the opposite corner of the inner lot,
have maintained t;heir i berths with
little difficulty throughout the season
as they are both playing a high-grade
game and handle themselves with the
poise and easy confidence of veter
ans. They will take these positions
against the Mission team. Kallam will
take his favorite stamping ground at
short and from the manner in which
he gathered in the bingles in Satur
day's contest the stick wielders of
the opposition will be hard put to
find a hole in his armorplate. Mitchell
is slated to keep the territory at the
second hassock clear of enemy apples
and his past performances at the
same job have proven him well able
to come through with a clean slate.
In the outskirts last Saturday's
formation worked through the game
without a flaw and Coach Seav will
try the same combination against the
Missionites. Carver will take left
field with Kline in center and Bundy
in right. The the end of twelve games
Carver was leading the batting list
with a mark well above the 300 level.
Saturday's game netted him no binglefc'
but he will likely take a fresh grip
on the stick tomorrow and check up
a couple to maintain his lead.
Kline has been delivering a con
sistent brand of good ball playing
from the start of the season, both in
the field and at the plate. His healthy
portside swats have come through
several times in pinches. Bundy
handled the fungo with a vengeance
in the last game and has been doing
this repeatedly all season.
"Lefty" Berg is scheduled to do the
heaving for the Missions, and, unless
the dope is wrong, will not get away
with the large tend of the score.
Sweeney will make the decisions and
the game is set for 3:00 p.m.
