# STANFORD ENTRY LIST FOR BIG MEET ISSUED
## Templeton Announces Men Who Will Compete Against Bruins 
### 
Stanford's complete entry list in the
big meet here Saturday with Walter
Christie's "wonder team" from Cali
fornia was announced today by Coach
"Dink" Templeton.
Thirty-five men compose the squad
the Cardinal mentor has picked to
wrest points from the Bruin tracksters.
Templeton said today he hoped his
men would take between 45 and 50
points in the big clash. This would give
the Bears approximately SO digits.
Intensive work started last night and
Templeton put his track charges
through many trial starts, and had them
jogging around the track several times.
Most of the field event men were also
out for a hard work-out. Only varsity
men were allowed on the field last
night, and the same rule will be in ef
fect this week.
According to announcement today
work will commence this afternoon
toward getting the track in shape for
the meet and indications are that oval
will be faster Saturday than it has been
all year. Addie Westwick, winner of
the two-mile against California last
season, is in charge of the work on the
track and lie will keep a squad of men
busy all week.
Stanford will present an unevenly
balanced team against California Sat
urday. In the sprints, hurdles, javelin,
high jump and the pole vault the Cards
appear to have an edge on their rivals.
In the quarter and the distances, the

Bears should nearly make a clean
sweep.
The sprints should offer the best
competition of the day. Although Cap
tain Morris Kirksey is in the best of
shape again, California sport followers
insist that Bob Hutchinson, the Bruin
flash, will lead the Stanford skipper to
the tape and are understood to lie will
ing t<» back up their claims with real
money. If that is true, it is probable
they will have little trouble in finding
takers.
Stanford will be allowed three en
tries in one of the dash events and
four in the other. Kirksey, Wells and
Carrey will compete in the century and
Kirksey, Forstcr and Comstock in the
furlong. Bumbaugh will be the fourth
Card entry in whatever race Temple
| ton is permitted four men.
