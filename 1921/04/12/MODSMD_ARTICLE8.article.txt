on Tuesday evening, May 31. This
undertaking will represent a new step
in the musical offerings of the Uni
versity and the committee hopes to
make the production the beginning of
an annual musical festival, which may
result' in the presentation each year
of grand opera in Hie original form,
including costume and action.
A number of noted artists have been
secured as soloists for the occasion.
Marguerite will be sung by Maude IhSv,
prima donna soprano of tin- Royal
Opera House in Munich. Miss Fay
began her work in California and
gained notable success before the war
Since that time she has appeared in
the principal capitals of Europe, The
part of Mephistopheles will be taken
by Alexander Bevani, who is well
known, especially in California, having
maintained an opera company of his
own here for some time. He has sung
the part of Mephisto often and is said
to be ideally suited to the role. Robert
Battison will sing the part of Faust.
He has appeared in the part a num
ber of times, recently in the Bevani
Opera Company. Besides these solo
ists, who are all previously experienced
in their roles, the baritone part of Val
entine will be taken by Marsden Ar
gall, '21, who sang last year in the
"Requiem" and who also appeared with
the Glee Club in their concert with the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
last quarter. The smaller parts will
be announced later.
The entire production is under the
direction of Warren D. Allen, Univer
sity organist, and will be given under
the auspices of the Symphony Com
mittee, who arranged the Symphony
Concert series for the year, and who
intend to make the opera a continua-
tion of the Symphony work for the
season.
An orchestra of over 40 pieces will
take part in the concert. A large num
ber of the orchestra will be members
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra, who have been secured for the
occasion, and the remainder will be
made up of members of the University
orchestra, and any members of the com
munity who wish to take part.
A chorus of 150 will sing the en
semble numbers. Work has already
been begun on the choral parts. The
Glee Club, Schubert Club and choir
will form the nucleus of the chorus.
The Morris Club of Palo Alto will
also take part and all students, faculty
members and residents in the commu
nity who are interested in music and
wish to take part are asked to make
application to Mr. Allen at once.
