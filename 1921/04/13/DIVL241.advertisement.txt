My dear Mr. Diggs:
Since- making application for One Million of insurance in California State Life I
have been the-recipient of numerous inquiries, and I will be glad to answer them through the
medium of your Company's publication.
1 am, and always have been, a firm believer in life insurance. 1 believe every man
should carry more or less. For years 1 have carried a liberal amount on my life. I recently
engaged in a business undertaking which justifies, in my belief, an increase in my life in
surance for the protection of those interested and those who expect to become interested in
the Virden packing Company. In consequence I determined to'secure an additional Million
Dollars of life insurance protection.
All things being equal, and there appears to be but little difference in the rates of
the various Insurance Companies, and all policies being safeguarded by wise insurance
laws, I felt that it was right and proper to place this application with a Western Company,
believing that we should, in so far as it is possible, support home institutions.
I determined on California State Life because I have watched its sound and steady
growth from the inception of the Company. I have confidence in the business integrity and
acumen of the men who handle its affairs and know that it gives the best of service to its
policy-holders. I'y reason of these beliefs I became an applicant with the California State
Life for a |)olicy of One Million Dollars on the ordinary life plan.
Very truly yoursr
(Signed) CHAS. E. VIRDEN
