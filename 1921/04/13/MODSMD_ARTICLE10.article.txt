# SILVER VANITY CASE IS DANCE PRIZE FOR CRAWL AFTER SHOWS
## 
### 
Through the efforts of the Carnival
Committee and the kindness of J. Niel
son, Palo Alto jeweler, a dainty silver
vanity case has been secured to be of
fered as a prize to the girl who re
ceives the most dances and favor at the
big dance following the first night of
the concessions at the Carnival.
The prize will be awarded to the girl
who at the end of the dance has con
tributed most to the menefit of the en
tertainment. It is a prettily engraved
silver case with a neat crest on the
cover.
Admission to the dance will be 50
cents per person, couples one dollar.
The advantage lies all with the single
man, and it is for the benefit of the
non-queeners that the dance is prima
rily given. The women who have vol
unteered their services have been se
lected by the Carnival Dance Commit
tee.
Refreshments will go with the dance
and partners will be obtainable at one
end of the hall that will be reserved
for that purpose only. A giant counter
across the whole end of the hall will
furnish rapid service to all the patrons.
Ambrose Whitmer will furnish mel
ody for the entertainment with his reg
ular troup of jazz purveyors. The ad
mission to the dance will have nothing
to do with the rest of the Carnival and
will be on a separate single payment.
