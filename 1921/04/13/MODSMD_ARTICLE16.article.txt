# DR. ANGELL WRITES ABOUT TRACK TIMING IN APRIL PICTORIAL
## 
### 
Dr. Frank Angell, official timer at
Stanford, writes his experiences in
checking the fleeting athlete, for the
Track and Carnival edition of the Pic
torial. He is one of the best timers in
the country and has made many inter
esting observations during the time he
has served in this capacity. The per
sonal element in timing is the consider
ation given most* attention. Most er
rors are traceable to this, Dr. Angell
states, and since the electric timer has
been used as a check, many facts have
been brought to light which will help
a great deal in official collegiate tim
ing, as it is done now.
"Spring has Come" is the half pag<j
of cuts illuminated by Harry Borba.
The proverbal young man's mind pic
torially turns to thoughts of Lagunita,
and all the spring flowers are seen out
nodding their dainty domes at the
guileless poet. The track section shows
action photographs of all the "reason
ably certain" winners for next Saturday
disporting themselves on the combusted
anthracites. Groups of concession pro
moters are pictured 011 the Carnival
Page and a discerning eye could no
doubt pick out some of the much ad
veU'sed group of 'fifty beautiful Span
i<di Dancing Girls" from some of the
cuts.
The book will be placed on sale dur
ing the latter part of the week.
