## Templeton Will Discuss Prospects For Saturday Victory; Kinney To Lead Informal Track Rally 
### 
Captain Morris Kirksey of the varsity track team will be the first speak
er at the Track-stadium assembly caled tomorrow at 11 a. m. Kirksey will
go into the need of a stadium from the point of view of an athlete, and
will explain what the bulding of the bowl will mean to the future of Cardinal
sports.
"Dink" Templeton, coach of the tracksters will go over the prospects for
the Big Meet Saturday. The Stanford band has been engaged to provide
music for the occasion, and Yell Leader Kinney will be ready to make a
real Cardinal track rally of the entire event.
The purpose of the assembly, according to F. L. McElroy, '21, president

of the student body, is to inform the
students of track possibilies and de
monstrate to the Cardinal athletes
that whatever their chances they have
the hacking of the entire Stanford
personnel, and to point out the stadi
um program and possibilities, to show
that if Stanford is to have a stadium
the students have a definite part to
carry out. Â»
For the first time a definite explana
tion of the plans for the athletic stadi
um will be presented to the student
body. Rumors have been current on
the campus regarding aid which the
students will be called upon to give
in making the stadium financial cam
paign a success. McElroy, will ex
plain in detail what relation the stu
dent body will have to the financial
drive and remove the prevalent mis
conceptions. The student body presi
dent declares that no direct appeal
will be made to students for personal
contributions to the fund, but that
they will be asked to play an even
more important part in presenting the
stadium idea to the public.
M. M. Kirksey, .student manager,
and representative on the.. Board of
Athletic Control, will discuss the rela
tion between track and foothall and
the proposed stadium. The plans for
the bowl were first announced last
fall after a proposal had been made
from several sources that a single
stadium should be built in San Fran
cisco to serve the purpose of both
Stanford and California. Kirksey will
explain why such a plan is entirely
unacceptable to Stanford and why the
Board of Athletic Control made . its
decision to start the building of a
stadium on the campus.

who will be on the plantform include
Guy Draper, '19, president of Encina
Club, "Art" Wilcox, president of the
Inter-Fraternity Conference, Irving
