Religion, love, history, poetry and
life itself can find interpretation
through the medium of the dance, ac
cording to Ted Shawn, who spoke
before Gordon Davis' class yesterday.
He told of the hardships that the life
of a dancer herd, but maintained that
it was worth them to be able to find
expression in the dance. Shawn spoke
not only of his art but of that of his
wife.
The dance exponent pled for vigor
in the youth to today that the human
body might be kept beautiful through
each and every one's personal effort.
il'Men," he said, "have a horror of be
ing graceful, and yet they call them
selves men who sit in stuffy offices or
sell ribbon over a counter, yet a man
who has acquired grace and delivers
a message to the world by the means
of it, is termed effeminate.
Shawn held the interest of the class
because of the personal element of his
discussions. Tickets for the perform
ance on Apri] 21, will be on sale at
Crandall's in Palo Alto and in the Ad
ministration Building until next Thurs
day.
