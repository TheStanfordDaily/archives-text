# DO STUDENTS WANT IT?

### 
Students have not been asked to take any definite part in the stadium
campaign, nor have they voluntarily tendered aid of any kind. Yet the
present undergraduates as athletes will work on the track and field of
(he new bowl, as rooters will take active part in the frfst great events
which by it will be made possible, and as studens will benefit most
directly from the natural stimulus and reaction bound to result from the
building of the stadium for the second big game as planned.
Not many students realize what a stadium will mean to the mem
bers of Stanford, what it will mean to athletics, or what it will mean to
the University. Some men in close touch with the athletic situation
believe that the lack of a stadium in the near future will handicap Stan
ford athletics to such an extent that we cannot long be formidable inter
collegiate contenders. They believe further that th£ building of a bowl
at this time will provide an advantage as important and vital as the
handicap to result from the lack of an adequate stadium.
In addition to the natural stimulus and favorable reaction the bowl
will insure proper financing of major and minor sports, which is now
a difficult problem. It would make possible the return of crew under
conditions a great deal more favorable than when the eights had to tour
to Redworxl for work on the bay. -
The question of Stanford's need of a stadium and the importance of
the success of present campaign to Stanford athletics, and to Stan
ford, will be presented by able student speakers in the track stadium as
sembly tomorrow. They will deal also with the more pointed problem
of what students can do in an important campaign in which their finan
cial assistance has not been asked.

WHETHER THE SENIOR CLASS will this year continue or discard
the endowment plan of insurance in favor of the University will be
considered at a meeting- called by Jack Patrick, '21, for tomorrow. A
qualified speaker familiar with insurance problems will discuss and ex
plain the endowment scheme. The seniors must either actively support
or discard the plan, and the meeting tomorrow will allow them oppor
tunity of getting facts on which to base a decision.
