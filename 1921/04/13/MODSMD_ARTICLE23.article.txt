# "Highbrow" Play.... ...Is Reviewed by... ...Dramatic Critic

### BY G. D 
Another mob delusion dispelled •' Some
of us honest middle class play-goers
who like our drama hot off the Broad
way griddle with lots of syrup to make
it easier to take, perchanced to drop
into the Assembly Hall last Saturday
night to view thic esoteric drama de
signed and for the faculty (who are
paid to enjoy such things) for a few
peculiar ones among the student body.
We may have gone to afcoff, but we
remained to laugh. We chortled; we
shook our sides with honest plcbian
laughter. And _ later, at the fireside,
where returned playgoers dutifully
gather to sling a wicked hammer be
fore goign to their deserved rest, we
missed the accustomed remarks: "Didriy
Mary Co-ed wear a dress in the
last act ? Wonder how much that set
her back?"—or, "Wliat did you think
of the storm effect in the second act?"
Instead we were greeted by a lively
discussion of the "deserving poor" and
the middle class virtues. Wonder of
wonders Mr. Shaw's offering whs be
ing discussed as a play, and it was
found to contain ideas which intrigued
the unwary into discussion. Sfiaw, —G.
Bernard Shaw had actually ' gotten by"
on the campus!
The acting was delightful, for most
of the parts were filled by seasoned
professionals perfectly cast as to type.
Irving Pichel, an actor and director of
distinction, gave a finished perform
ance of the leading male character.
He knew how to get his laughs, and
yet he didn't neglect the lines or the
purpose of the author. Sam Hume, the
director of the Greek Theater at Cali
fornia, ably abetted Mr. Pichel in his
conspiracy to deliver fine acting.
Violette Wilson with a charm and a
nerve that we shan't soon forget, gave
us a particularly satisfying Eliza. Per
haps the most interesting work of the
evening to those of us who are ac
customed to student actors on our As
sembly Hall stage 'was done by Lloyd
Corrigan. It is only once in a blue
moon that so excellent a piece of sus
tained characterization by a young stu
dent is seen on our stage. The settings
were extempore and therefore need not
be called to account.
The significant fact for us lies in
this—a so-called high-brow play gave
us of the masses and evening 'of solid
enjoyment. Therefore let us away with
the idea that the student proletariat will
not stand for the best drama. Let us
have faith in the common sense of our
public, and that faith will not be mis
placed. The Greek Theater players
have proved that for us.

it easier to take, perchanced to drop
into the Assembly Hall last Saturday
night to view thic esoteric drama de
signed and for the faculty (who are
paid to enjoy such things) for a few
peculiar ones among the student body.
We may have gone to afcoff, but we
remained to laugh. We chortled; we
shook our sides with honest plcbian
laughter. And _ later, at the fireside,
where returned playgoers dutifully
gather to sling a wicked hammer be
fore goign to their deserved rest, we
missed the accustomed remarks: "Didriy
Mary Co-ed wear a dress in the
last act ? Wonder how much that set
her back?"—or, "Wliat did you think
of the storm effect in the second act?"
Instead we were greeted by a lively
discussion of the "deserving poor" and
the middle class virtues. Wonder of
wonders Mr. Shaw's offering whs be
ing discussed as a play, and it was
found to contain ideas which intrigued
the unwary into discussion. Sfiaw, —G.
Bernard Shaw had actually ' gotten by"
on the campus!
The acting was delightful, for most
of the parts were filled by seasoned
professionals perfectly cast as to type.
Irving Pichel, an actor and director of
distinction, gave a finished perform
ance of the leading male character.
He knew how to get his laughs, and
yet he didn't neglect the lines or the
purpose of the author. Sam Hume, the
director of the Greek Theater at Cali
fornia, ably abetted Mr. Pichel in his
conspiracy to deliver fine acting.
Violette Wilson with a charm and a
nerve that we shan't soon forget, gave
us a particularly satisfying Eliza. Per
haps the most interesting work of the
evening to those of us who are ac
customed to student actors on our As
sembly Hall stage 'was done by Lloyd
Corrigan. It is only once in a blue
moon that so excellent a piece of sus
tained characterization by a young stu
dent is seen on our stage. The settings
were extempore and therefore need not
be called to account.
The significant fact for us lies in
this—a so-called high-brow play gave
us of the masses and evening 'of solid
enjoyment. Therefore let us away with
the idea that the student proletariat will
not stand for the best drama. Let us
have faith in the common sense of our
public, and that faith will not be mis
placed. The Greek Theater players
have proved that for us.
