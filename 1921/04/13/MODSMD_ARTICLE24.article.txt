# CABBAGES AND THINGS

### 
<§> T. 1.. '23 -* <?>
That election worried us yesterday.
We had the winner already picked and
our propaganda had gone to press,
when the word came in that the pres
ent incumbent was losing out. The
worst part of it was that we didn't
have anything on the apparent winner.
Then when the final reports came in
we felt like "Ain't that a grand and
Glorious Fe«lin'."
* * *
We could send a dozen track teams
east if they'd put on an election Uke
that yesterday. It pays to have a
Hibernian candidate.
• • •
We haven't said anything about, the
Queen yet and that's only half the
story. We won't be inveigled into
co-ed politics.
** * x
Our candidate for the Hall of Fam«
is the bird who piped up at the polls
yesterday with, "When things has
gone so far a man has to buy a job,
I agree with the guy that calls this a
rich man's college." Yes, Mabelette,
there's one born every minute,
» • •
While we think of it, isn't it rather
unusual to drown the King and the
Queen? We were under the impres
sion mat all due honor and reverence
was accorded them.
• • •
If, this competition to Cabbages
keeps up in the feature stories and
the Classified Ads, we're going to re
sign. We tired of this continual
brazen blighting of the immortal name
of humor anyway.

He—Why do they put rings In pigs'
noses?
Haw—To keep 'em from rootin*.
