Dorothea Spinney this evening in the
Little Theater at 8 o'clock. Miss Spin
ney is well-known throughout this
country and England as an interpreter
of classical drama, and her appearance
here was made possible by the co-op
eration of the University and the Clas
sical Club.

Although she is an English wouan,
Miss Spinney is by no means a stranger
in this vicinity, having visited the Uni
versity twice before, the last time in
1916. She is at present giving dramatic
readings in the leading cities and uni
versities of the country.
Miss Spinney does not confine her
self to thf' classical drama alone, but
also presents readings of the more fa
mous modern plays, especially those of
Shakespeare. On Thursday afternoon
she is to appear at the Player's Theater
in San Francisco in "Hamlet."
Euripides, the author of the play
which Spinney will read tonight,
is one of the three great writers of
Greek tragedy, and the "Alcestis" was
written in tin* fifth century, li. C. In
order to portray the roles more vividly
Miss Spinney will appear in a Greek
costume.
