of that body. The petitions were
signed by some 1600 members of the

sented practically every member who
could be reached. The rest are among
those Htudents who are not actually
on the campus, or among a few who
were not opposed to the honor plan
but could not agree to all the parts
of it. *
Departmental sections of the cards
have been made and the ones in each
department have been sent to the re
spective heads. The faculty heads of
the departments will check these with
their lists and then make their recom
mendations accordingly. As far as the
