# Beauty In Dozen Lots Is Offer of Ram's Head Chorus
## 
### W.C. Evans, '22 
"See Paris and die." Don't you be
lieve it. Take a pipe at the twelve
pippins that the Ram's Head is offer
ing for the rejuvenation of the eyes
of the tired business man and fatigued
student and Prof., and you will see the
emptiness in the old propaganda state
mint of the French advertisers. Nope
Bucephalus, there's nothing in it.
These even dozen bits of charming
grace and dancing wonder have every
thing on the hall that Niobe and her
seven maids of the mist lacked. In
fact, they are there. Nuff sed,
Yesterday when Ted Shawn was
flown on the farm he gave them the
once over and offered a blanket con
tract to the troupe, not because of the
cold, or for philanthropic reasons, hut
Ihccause they were the ne plus ultra.
Jack Heffernan had a light workout
with the chorus yesterday in the Wom
en's Clubhouse and they put on a little
catchy dance that caught our eye and
sent us away with a thankful heart that
we are not blind even if we do wear
goggles.
And not forgetting, as the lady said
when she came hack to the table fur the
gum that she had hidden underneath,
there is a song that the chorus sings
and dances to, written by our Ambrose.
Songs, Melodies, Jazz, llmmmminm!
You can't resist it. It's got something
in its makeup that takes you away from
the sordid thoughts of admissions and
ether disagreeable parts of life, and
puts you in the court of some far away
potentate where they have dancers for
the calling that while away the cares
of the day. Such is this music. It's
name is "Russian Cabaret," but it ain't
so rushin' as you think, just slow, and,
er.-er-er well, jest right.
