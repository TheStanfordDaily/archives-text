# MARTIN SPEAKS ABOUT POSITION OF BRAZIL TODAY
## Friendship Between U.S. and South American Country is Traditional, Says Speaker 
### 
"Brazil and the United States have
long maintained a traditional friend
ship, and the possibilities for our co
operation with this South American re
public are many," said Professor Percy
A. Martin in discussing the interna
tional relations of the two countries in
his illustrated lecture on "Past and
Present Day Brazil," in the Little Thea
ter last evening.
Brazil today is facing many of the
problems which we have faced and are
facing, Professor Martin said. She is
ready to profit by us, and we should be
willing to hold out a helping hand to
her. He pointed out the numerous pos
sibilities of this largest and most in
teresting of the South American repub
lics, giving an account of present con
ditions there and describing the prin
cipal cities and localities which he had
visited. The major part of the lecture,
which dealt largely with first hand im
pressions, was prefaced by an account
of the size, character and histoify of
Brazil. Professor Martin outlined the
development of that country from its
occupation by the Portuguese, through
the ,period of the Brazilian Empire
when slavery agitation was at its
height, down to the present republic
which was declared in 1889.
The lecture was illustrated with his
torical slides and with a number made
from pictures taken by Professor Mar
tin. The latter part of his discussion
was occupied with a description of
some of the principal cities of Brazil,
among them Rio de Janeiro, and of the
coffee states of Minas Giraes and Sao
paulo.
"Rio de Janeiro," Professor Martin
said, 'is one of the most interesting
and picturesque cities in the world. It
is a city of magnificent distances,
flanked by grotesquely beautiful moun
tains and containing numerous and im
posing* buildings, parks, avenues and
modern boulevards." Professor Mar
tin described several of the municipal
buildings, among them the Civic Opera
House, the Monroe Palace for distin
guished visitors, the National Library
and the Presidential Palace. Many slides
which were used illustrated the natural
beauties of Rio de Janeiro, such as the
Avenida de la Mar, the Sugar Loaf
and Hunch-Back Mountains and the fa

mous botanical gardens.
The remainder of the lecture was de
voted to an account of visits to the
states of Minas Geraes and Saopaulo,
formerly mining districts, but now
largely devoted to agriculture, partic
ularly the production of rubber and cof
fee. Professor Martin described sev
eral places of interest in the two states,
among them the old city of Oro Prieto
and the modern, up-to-date settlements
at Saopaulo.

"Rio de Janeiro," Professor Martin
said, 'is one of the most interesting
and picturesque cities in the world. It
is a city of magnificent distances,
flanked by grotesquely beautiful moun
tains and containing numerous and im
posing* buildings, parks, avenues and
modern boulevards." Professor Mar
tin described several of the municipal
buildings, among them the Civic Opera
House, the Monroe Palace for distin
guished visitors, the National Library
and the Presidential Palace. Many slides
which were used illustrated the natural
beauties of Rio de Janeiro, such as the
Avenida de la Mar, the Sugar Loaf
and Hunch-Back Mountains and the fa

mous botanical gardens.
The remainder of the lecture was de
voted to an account of visits to the
states of Minas Geraes and Saopaulo,
formerly mining districts, but now
largely devoted to agriculture, partic
ularly the production of rubber and cof
fee. Professor Martin described sev
eral places of interest in the two states,
among them the old city of Oro Prieto
and the modern, up-to-date settlements
at Saopaulo.
