# STADIUM. TRACK ARE SUBJECTS OF ASSEMBLY TODAY
## McElroy Asks Co-operation of Students in Working Out Stadium Campaign Details 
### 
Let student become a commit
tee of one to influence somebody some
where to contribute $100—for every
$100 will mean one more touchdown for
future Stanford victories," said Presi
dent Moyd L. McElrby in outlining at
this morning s assembly the part that
Stanford men and women now in col
lege will pay in financing the football
stadium.
McElroy explained that no campaign
will be carried on among the students,
but that contributions will be gladly re
ceived from such as are financially able
to contribute. The president described
the stadium as designed by Professor
C. B. Wing and showed why the plan
to build jointly with tlft University of
California at San Francisco was not
practical.
McElroy scored the view that "the
good old days are gone" and showed
that freshmen teams were improving,
while varsity teams had maintained the
same calibre as before. The fault, he
claimed, was in the fact that Stanford
athletics had remained the same, while
California had rapidly become stronger.
The effect for improvement which the
stadium will have on athletics was dis
cussed. "We must have $200,000 within
the next few months to put it over,"
he concluded," and it rests with Stan
ford students- to carry on a vigorous
campaign among friends of the Uni
versity."
Morris Kirksey, track captain and
member of the Board of Athletic Con
trol, reviewed the present status of ma
jor sports, and declared that the sta
dium would be the savior of competi
tive athletics at Stanford.
• An informal rally for the Big Meet
with California Saturday, conducted by
Yell Leader Wendell Kinney, took up
the remainder of the hour. Coach
' Dink" Templeton, in summing up the
Cardinal prospects, said. "We're not
going to be disgraced if we lose and
if we win it's going to be the greatest
honor a track team has ever/ brought
to Stanford—and we have a chance to
win." Templeton enumerated the dif
ficulties that have been encountered in
track this year, but said that with the
odds against Stanford there was every
thing to win and nothing to lose.
The Stanford band furnished the mu
sic for the assembly.
