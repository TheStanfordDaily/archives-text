Wall! Wall! Come natural, buy my
lioney those drap'ries ] seen last night
on Peg Whealton's K. O. Korus. Also
play again that haunting njelody that
feature the dance where Frances Mer
rill and Jack Heffernan lead the bal
let. It is fine and not to speak of this
interesting part of the program, an ad
ditional part of the gratis entertain
ment that is the shining light of the
evening.
In the first song, "Wall Wah," Jack
Heffernan and Frances Merrill lead off
with the verse, and the chorus comes
tripping in to a finish with a few dainty
steps and a perfectly figured finale. Peg
Whealton sings the second number,
"Russian Ballet," and uses the verstile
chorus to good advantage in putting
over the selection.
Les Seib and Foresta Hodgson, '24,
a new lady 011 the campus, will put on
a specialty dance with special music
during the evening's dancing. Les needs
no introduction to campus audiences
and Miss Hodgson is a graduate of
one of the best fancy dancing acade
mies in New York. Caveat Emptor.
