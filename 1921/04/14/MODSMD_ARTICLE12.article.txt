# TEMPLETON'S SQUAD GOES THROUGH PACES FOR BRUIN CONTEST
## Track Mentor Gives Varsity Last Work-out for Battle With California Saturday 
### 
"Dink" Tem,)leton put his track co
horts through their last workouts last
night prior to the "big meet" here
Saturday with the California varsity.
From now until day after tomorrow at
2 o'clock, the Cardinal coach has in
structed his men to take things easy.
With the exception, of Won Weaver,
high jumper, and Minsky, broad jump
er, the squad is in good shape for the
clash with Walter Christie's "wonder
team." Weaver is in the hospital
with the "flu" and it is a question
whether he will be in form to com
pete against the Blue and Gold jump
ers. Minsky again injured his weak
ankle the other night in practice, but
iB expected to be in shape Saturday.
Reports from Berkeley indicate that
the Bruin athletes are in the best pos
sible shape for the big clash. Christie
announced his complete entries yes
terday and his list far outnumbers the
number named by Templeton. The
California mentor and most of .the
sport followers across the bay are un
derstood to anticipate an easy victory j
over the Stanford team.
Stanford's chanees of rolling up
points against the Bears Saturday,
seem to lie in the sprints with Cap
tain Kirksey, Wells, A1 Carrey, and
Forster; in the hurdles where Wells,
Falk and Williams apparently have
a decided edge 011 Drew and Hender
son, the California barrier men; in
the pole vault where Wilcox, Green
and Norris of the Bears, all seem
about 0:1 a par; in the javelin where
Flint Manner has a bit the better of
the dope on Cort Majors and in the
discus where Tauzer and Muller seem
about equal.
Heath and Weaver, provided the
latter is in shape, should give "Brick"
Muller plenty of competition in the
high jump although the star Bruin foot
ball player is conceded first place 011
his past performances and his record
in the Olympic Games last summer.
Most of the tickets for the big meet
have been sold and the graduate man
ager's offce expects the bleachers to
be filled long before the first event is
called.
