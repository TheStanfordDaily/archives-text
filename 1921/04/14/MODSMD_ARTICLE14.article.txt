# CARDINAL NINE DEFEATS SANTA CLARA 5 TO 2
## Green is Star at the Plate With Mitchell and Kallam Breaking Even for Second 
### 
Coach Seay's men romped away
with the heavy end of a 5 to 2 score
when they met the Santa Clara team
on the local field, yesterday afternoon.
The contest was a mixture of loose
and tight ball playing, with the Cardi
nal men putting a good deal of weight
on the stick throughout.
Draper took the mound for the home
team at the start with Green at the
receiving end. This combination
worked three innings and then Kelly
took the slab position. In the first
inning Draper set the Miesionites down
in one-two-three order. Mitchell came
through in the same frame with the
first run. The Missionites came back
strong in the second and with the
help of two bingles and an error they
crossed the rubber for two tallies.
Our men were quiet during this frame.
Draper opened up again in the third
and retired the opposition with no out
ward disturbances. Mitchell drove out
a clean single and Kallam followed up
with a three-bagger which tied the
score. Berg took another hitch in his
belt from this point and Kallam died
on third.
The fourth frame was quiet with
the exception of a long drive to left
by Green which netted him three
bases, but Kelly's short bingle to short
proved disastrous as Green was caught
off home. Mitchell thought it was
time for him to annex a three-sacker
to his averages so he proceeded to
do so in the fifth. He sure started
something. Kallam placed a single
to left, and Crowe clipped a double to
right. The bases were hot and when
the dust cleared we had three more
markers to our credit.
This burst was twfe last of the con
test. Nef and Bundy replaced Kelly
and Green in the seventh and held
the visitors down to two hits. Carver
and Patterfion started a hitting rally
in the eighth but Patterson was caught
