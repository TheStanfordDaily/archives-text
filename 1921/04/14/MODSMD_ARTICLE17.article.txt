The new and strikingly advantageous position in which the Stan
ford stadium will place Cardinal athletics was presented as the most
significant note of this morning's assembly. Because of the excellent
available site and the plan fixed on by the l>oard of Control we can
build a bowl in the most attractive surroundings with thoroughly ade
quate accommodations at a minimum cost. The combination of for
tunate circumstances is one that will be found at few universities in
the country when they consider stadium possibilities.
These same circumstances will make the first financial returns
from a stadium for athletic purposes greater than ever dreamed of at
Stanford. Sufficient financial support of athletics means that our teams
will Ik* better, that training accommodations will be such as to induce
men to work in athletics, and that more desirable and well qualified
men will choose Stanford as their university.
In the campaign for subscriptions which will permit of the erec
tion of the bowl according to plans, students may take a large or small
part in the opportunity they have to give effectively publicity to the
Stanford stadium plan. The postal card scheme advanced in the as
sembly this morning is one that every student may use. And every
member of the University who has an eye to the good of Stanford can
easily find other measures to take in bolstering the progress of the
stadium.
