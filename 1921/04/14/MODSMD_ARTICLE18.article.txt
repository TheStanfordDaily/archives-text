# THE 						UNION REVILATIZED
## 
### 
What of the Stanford Union? Ask that question of any student
on the Quad and a surprised answer will echo back, "Well, what?" In
that indifferent surprise lies the significance of the present relation be
tween the Union and the student Ixxly. Frankly, we must admit that
the Union today does not perform the services for which it was built.
Founded to provide a common club for Stanford men, on the pattern
of the famous Oxford organization, it is a club to but few students.
\ committee meeting* room ? Occasionally, committees resort to
the Union. A restaurant? For a limited number. A lounging room
for (he fellows to gang together? Rarely. The natural place for Stan
ford get-to-gether affairs? The use of the Union by the Sophomore>
in giving a class smoker Tuesday evening is a sharp reminder of the
infrequency that it has been used for similar purposes this year.
It is useless to carp over a disagreeable picture, but it is essential
to determine whether or not the Union of the future is to perform a
vital function in the life of the University. That does not mean abstract
discussion of Stanford democracy. It means to emphasize the prac
tical methods by which it can be of direct service.
The dormant possibilities of the Union are capable of practical
expansion. Before the war the "Union IIop" was the popular campus
dance and can be revived, even at the expense of the Palo Alto taxis.
The addition of the eating clubs must be used as the occasion to elim
inate the restaurant atmosphere. Is it unreasonable to ask that a reader
of periodicals may find a current copy of, say, "The Literary Digest,"
if he picks tip a binder so marked, and not a last year's number of "The
New Vork Fashion Plate?" 1 —W. M. K.

THAT THE VIEWPOINT of the Daily be not limited to the vision
of one man, and in order that the staff of the Daily may be more ade
quately a training organization for its members, comment by various
staff writers will be presented from time to time in these columns.
