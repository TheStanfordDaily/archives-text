### M. B. '22 
A Dramatic Evening
Dramatics entering into the make
up of the Carnival's amusements with
a vengeance. Three or those organi
zations under suspicion are Ram's
Head, Masquers and Sword and San
dals. Ram's Head are developing
another chorus number to charm the
throng and Masquers, together with
Sword and Sandals are compiling a
touching melodrama on college life as
lived by the typical Co-Ed, Dean of
Women, Professors, etc.
Ram's Head Scores Point
Not to be infringing on the burnt
match or anything, but wc have dis
covered a good word for Ram's Head.
You can discover it too if you will
notice that they are giving a very
neat and prize-winning performance at
the Carnival again for nothing. Notice
the last word, Translated, it means
free. Whereas, those Carnival people
bleed our pockets for shows not half
so interesting. We cast our vote for
Ram's Head.
The Expressor Expresses
Ted Shawn is the original little ex
pressor. He expresses himself in
dancing, through the channels of his
Waterman and then today if he didn't
score another point by expressing him
self in words. Wonder >if his face
registers?
Enter the Villain
We saw a checkered coat individual
busy about the Assembly Hall
and immediately checked him up as
mistaking the Hall for the stables,
but upon investigation we found that
we were all wrong. He was taking
measurement for those gray curtain
drops that we have been hearing so
much about. Guess the idea is com
ing through and the tickets for the
Dancers are selling fast.
