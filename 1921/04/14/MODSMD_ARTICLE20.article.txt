This is the "Looking Backward"
number of Cabbages. When you get
through maybe you'll believe we ve
been thinking backward. But anyway
when we were looking over an old
volume of the "Daily" published in the
year double-goose-egg, we came across
a few special notices and news items
worthy of mention.. They follow:
"We know all of you boys don't
smoke five-cent cigars, but if you once
try Flor de Basca you will never
change. Alloggi & Co." To the stu
dent of logic this ad of more or less
doubtful grammar, car only mean that
nobody's doing it and only one try
is required to prove the wisdom of
the negative.

London Ladies Tailoring Parlors ad

"One of the features of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin's Proms is the
'dark dance' in which the lights are
turned off while the music and danc
ing continue. This has been in vogue
at Wisconsin for years and is in high
favor." Well, it ought to be. We
favor it.

"Mrs. A. Mayer, French corset
maker from Paris. Feathers curled,
washed and dyed." Is that why they
call 'em chickens?

"Before selling your furniture, give
us a chance to figure on it." If it's
anything like our table, there isn't.
room left for any more figures.
