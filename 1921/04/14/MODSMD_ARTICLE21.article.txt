# REQUISITION SYSTEM DEVISED BY KIRKSEY TO CURB BAD DEBTS
## 
### 
Student Manager Morris Kirksey,
has devised a new requisition system
by which the classes and organizations
may be kept out of debt. The system
provides that each class shall author
ize one- person to pay its bills. Before
any money is spent this representa
tive must first approximate the sum
needed, and have the statement in
spected and approved by the Student
Hody Manager. For this sum, the
student will be responsible, but the
merchants sell anything over the
stated amount at their own risk. Tho
System thus has a check on the organ
ization, and furnishes a guarantee to
the merchants. A similar plan has
already been successfully employed by
the Hoard of Athletic Control.
