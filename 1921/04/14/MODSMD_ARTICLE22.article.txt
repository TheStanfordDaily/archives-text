# CARD RACQUETERS BATTLE WITH BRUIN RIVALS SATURDAY
## Neer, Davies, Turner and Fish to Meet California Team On Local Courts at 10 a.m. 
### 
The varsity tennis doubles teams
which will face the Blue and Gold
racqueters, Saturday, in the annual
intercollegiate tournament, have been
picked and will be composed of Neer,
Davies, Turner and Fish. Neer and
Davies will compose the first doubles
team, while Fish and Turner will form
the second combination.
The doubles matches will undoubted
ly be the closest of the meet and with
Jim Davies and Captain Phil Neer
battling the veteran combination of
Levy and Bates, the match will prob
ably go to extra sets to determine the
winner. Last year, the Davies-Neer
team won the Pacific Coast intercol
legiate doubles championship at the
tournament held at Ojai Valley while
Bates and Levy made an enviable
record among the eastern colleges last
spring.
The second doubles team, composed
of Skee Turner and Berry Fish, will
meet the Bruin team of Casey and
Weinsteln. Both the Californians are
new men on the squad but have a
good record. Weinstein ranks high
in several tournaments held on the
Coast last summer. Turner and Fish
are both playing their third year on
the Cardinal varsity and will have a
slight edge in experience.
In the singles matches, Saturday,
the play between Bates and Davies
will exhibit some of the highest types
of a hard hitting game. Both men
have a terrific smash and drive style
and the mateh will go to the man who
is able to gain the net and hold it.
Bates last summer ranked as one of
the best intercollegiate players by the
eastern critics. Davies defeated Bates
last year at Ojai, but both players have
shown a great improvement over their
playing last season and the match
Saturday will be in doubt until the
finish.
This afternoon, the Varsity will play
the California Club of San Francisco,
at San Francisco, in the final of the
practice matches before the intercol
legiate tournament. The California
club will bo represented by the Kinsey
brothers, William Johnston, and Davis.
Practice on doubles matches will con
stitute most of the play.
