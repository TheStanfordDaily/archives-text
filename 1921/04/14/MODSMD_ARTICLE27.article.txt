'Very simple. Just knock a regula
tion ten pin over and win fifty cents.
Three shots for a dime. Yes it can be
done. No, madame, it is not a fake.
What, can we do it ? Certainly, but
not until tomorrow. Don't crowd, there
is plenty for all. Ladies first, co-eds
last. Almost made it that time. Try
•your luck again only ten cents and you
stand to win fifty. Oh Gee, I thought
it was, Say Ike make that guy quit,
he is getting too good. Shift the table
a little this stunt has been on the level
too long as it is."
Such is the line we heard the barker
for the Phi Alpha Delta-Phi Delta Phi
concession rehearsing in a deep dark
corner of the cactus garden in the wee
small hours of the morning. From all
we could gather the main object of the
stunt is to K. C). a poor unsuspecting
ten pin with a blow from a sixteen
pound shot suspended on a six foot
chain. It sounds easy, but we suspect
the presence of the well known nigger
in the equally well known wood pile.
