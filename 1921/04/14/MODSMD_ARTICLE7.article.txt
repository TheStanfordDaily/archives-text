Special Despatch from Mars via The
Press Club
"She Hangs out in Onr Alley, bu#
Gosh, What She Hangs Out On Friday
and Saturday Nights," is the handle for
the. pleasing little skit that Masquers
and Sword and Sandals are offering to
the theater goers of Stanford in con
nection with the Fiesta 011 Friday night.
Ihe play is the harrowing experiences
of the last five inmates of Raniford
University, the great Oriental seminary,
in their attempt to enter the Kingdom
of the Everlasting.
The characters in the order of their
application are as follows: Wilsha
Trowalyne, the blushing beauty ;jnd
lead of the playlet and I. Konn Wiggle,
the snake and venomous exponent of
latter day sin as practiced in the great
institutions of learning of the time.
Next in appearance is Ivetha Longun
zon, female intelligenceuse p rentier.
Her opposite is the one who immedi
ately follows in the person of none less
than old Sir B. Hardern Helle D. A.
M., I. M., the portrayal of the faithful
ruff as experienced in the ultra modern
down to date time of the action. Izzy
Natch Kell, playing the quaint role of
St. Peter, gate-keeper and ticket taker
at the door of pearls, is admirably fitted
for the part with his paternal mein and
wavy pale locks. His sweet manner of
leading the aspirants on and then dash
ing their young hopes to the bitter sod
is strangely reminiscent of the blithe
some university days that they so re
cently left behind.
