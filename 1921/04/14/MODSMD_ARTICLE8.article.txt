on the last two championship varsity

measure responsible for the Stanford
victories over the University of Cali
fornia five in this year's series. Davies
plays forward and is an aggressive
player of the "go-get-'em" type.

also a recqueter of considerable note.
He holds the Pacific Inter-collegiate
Singles Championship and the Califor
nia State Singles title. With Phil Neer
he is the holder of the Pacific Intcr
coikgiate Doubles title, and he stands

Davies should make a very capable
captain, not only because of his ability
in handling the 1 ORthern pellet in ap
proved fashion, but because of his
knowledge of the game.
He is a member of Skull and Snakes,
and Delta Kappa Epsilon.
