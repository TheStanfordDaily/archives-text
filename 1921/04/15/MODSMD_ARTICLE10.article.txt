the Blue and Gold tpam, "will face each
other in the opening match of the an
nual intercollegiate tennir. tournament

o'clock 011 the Stanford courts. The
match gives promise of being the
hardest fought of the tourney and ac
coiding to the dope, the sets will run
into extra games.
Last year at the intercollegiate
tournament at Ojai valley, Davies de
feated Bates by a close score for the
Pacific Coast intercollegiate singles

ranked as one of the best of inter

present holder of the Ojai Valley open
Bingles championship although he has
been hindered by a wrenched knee this
season, will be able to make things
interesting for the California man to
morrow morning.

the California varsity, hails from San
Francisco, Where he made a good re
cord as a junior player. Last sum
mer, he took part in a number of
state and Pacific Coast tournaments,
ranking well up among the best.
