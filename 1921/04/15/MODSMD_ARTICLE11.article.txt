# ONE-ACT PLAYLET IS FEATURE OF SMOKER
## 
### 
The first Sequoia smoker of the quar
ter was opened last night by Jack
Heffernan, '22, of Encina Club with a
group of humorous songs. A recita
tion by Phil Landis, '23 was followed
by T. Van Ducsen,* '24, and E. De
Sousa, '22, who put on a Spanish vau
deville skit.
"All for an Egg" was the title of
the closing act. The. scene was laid
in the home of a poverty stricken law
yer of the year 1962, whose salary was
but a $10,000 pittance. After a luxuri
ous meal of crackers, his wife breaks
the sad news that the doctor has pre
scribed another egg for her. The last
hen-fruit had been bought with a first
mortgage on the old homestead and
as the auctioneers hammer had knocked
it down long since, there is nothing left
for poor Irene to do but vamp it out
of a late admirer, who obligingly hap
pens by on an errand for the Food
Trust. In the end everybody's heart
and the egg is broken. The cast was
Haley, who played Irene, and Faulds
and Loveless, all freshmen.
