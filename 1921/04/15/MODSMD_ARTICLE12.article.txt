# CARD TRACK MEN BATTLE BERKELEY SQUAD TOMORROW
## "DINK" TEMPLETON HOLDS CHARGES IN READINESS FOR SEASON'S CLIMAX HUTCHINSON WITH KIRKSEY IN DASHES IS MEET'S FEATURE 
### E. C. WEST, '23 
Stanford meets the California varsity on the Cardinal oval tomorrow.
When starter Frank Foster calls the milers to their marks at 2 o'clock
the two leading coast universities will contest for supremacy on the track
for the twenty-eighth time, one doped by experts as an overwhelming victor,
the other granted only that time-worn "fighting chance."

California, fresh from a decisive victory over the best the east could
offer, Michigan, is confident. Stanford, its team crippled by loss of men all
through the season and at the last minute Is ready.
Coach "Dink" Templeton, hero of countless athletic contests, has his
men primed for the meet. "Tell 'em we've always got a chance," he said
when asked for a statement last night and with that hurried off to watch one
of his men hurl the discus.
On paper, the meet seems to be but a question of how many points the
Cardinals will be able to roll up against Walter Christie's "wonder team."
California has a decided edge on pre-season performances, the only possible
way for the sports writers to decide the result before the first race has keen
run. ,
Stanford with an even break of luck should score between forty-five and
fifty points, leaving the Bruins approximately eighty-flve digits. Some of the
experts give Templeton's men fifty-five, others only forty.
At any rate the chief interest in tomorrow's meet will probably hinge
on separate events rather than on the ultimate score.
Captain Morris Kirksey, recognized as the second fastest man in the world,
will be pitted against the most capable sprinter California has ever had
when he toes the mark with Bob Hutchinson. The Bruin flash has equaled
Kirksey's marks all during the season and the Card skipper will undoubtedly
be forced to run under even time to break the tape in the hundred.. While
sport followers dope Kirksey to win the shorter race, they claim Hutchinson
has a good chance to takes the furlong. The dashes should off»r the thrills,
of the meet.

Stanford, according to dope, should score heavily in the hurdles. Jess
Wells, last year's captain and intercollegiate low stick champion, is in good
shape again and with Bob Williams and Lane Falk as running mates, ought
to give tie Card point column a flock of digits.

Where Stanford is weak the Bears
seem-. to be strong. With both
Hendrixson and McDonald credited
with running fifty flat in the quarter,
Sprott and Saunders going close to
1:56 in the half, Sprott and Mejia tak
ing turns at winning miles well under
4:30 and Dorr and Denton both sched-

usel to shatter the existing two-mile
mark, Christie's cohorts should talie
practically all the points in these
races.
Art Wilcox and Morris should pro
vide an interesting duel in the pole
vault. Hanner and Majors, the Cali
fornia football captain, seem about
even in the javelin. Tauzer and Mai
ler ought to have a close fight for
first in discus. In the high jump, Mul
ler appears to have the edge although
Heath and Weaver, provided the latter

£ Hendrixson and McDonald who fin- 1
f* ished neck and neck in 49:4 against

that. Saxby is to be classed as a con- t
tendor,
HIGH HURDLES
STANFORD—WeIIs, Williams, Falk.
CALIFORNIA — Henderson, Henry
Allen, Bassett.
Here for the first time Stanford has
the decided edge. Willi Wells and Wil
liams both in shape and easily gfrod for
under 16 flat, the Cards have a good
chance of finishing one, two. Hender
son and Henry of the Bears are good
for 16 seconds.
100-YARD DASH
STANFORD—Capt. Kirksey, Wells,
Carrey, (Bumbaugh)
CALIFORNIA —Hutchinson, Arkely
Calden, Cole.
It will be Kirksey, then Hutchinson
and the rest will finish in a bunch.
Wells and Carrey should fight it out
for third at that, unless "Brick" Morse's
• "wonder .sprinter," Calden, really has
j| the goods. The meet will be worth
' seeing to discover that fact, it for noth
• ing else.
I 2 MILE RUN
; STANFORD — Eddleman. French
• Rousselot.
! CALIFORNIA —Dorr, Kitts, Denton,
| Hawcs, Frost, Calkins.
■ Dorr's mark of 9:40 gives him first
> without question. He should shatter •
the Stanford-California record for this
• event. Denton, Kitts and Bill Eddie-
man, who placed last year for Stan- ,
ford, will fight it out for the other '
places.
880-YARD RUN
STANFORD—Williamson, Carlsmith,
Murphy.
CALIFORNIA — Captain Sprott, 1
Wentworth, Waltz, Saunders, Moore, 1
Plummcr.
Sprott and Saunders have a big edge 1
on time. Carlsmith or Williamson have
an outside chance to beat Waltz and
Wentworth for tliird.
220-YARD HURDLES
STANFORD—WeIIs, Hayes, Falk.
CALIFORNIA—Drew, Van Sant,
Henderson, Henry.
Wells, in bis best shape, should win.
Drew is a fast man and must be con
sidered to place. This should be one of
the best races of the afternoon.
220-YARD DASH
STANFORD — Kirksey, Forster
Comstock, (Bumbaugh).
CALlFORNlA—Hutchinson, Arkely,
Hendrixson, Cole.
The furlong, without doubt, will be
the fastest and best event on the menu.
Kirksey will find himself against two
speed merchants in Hutfchiiv>on and
' Oxy" Hendrixson, but should win.
RELAY
STANFORD — Williamson, Hertel,
R. Wright, K. Wright.
CALIFORNIA — McDonald, Sa.\b>
Sprott, Hendrixson.
Always interesting for the spectators,

| the relay tomorrow should provide
I thrills a plenty. The Bears have yet
to be defeated in this race, but Tem
pleton has four fast quarter milers to
! shoot at them.
SHOT PUT
j STANFORD — Hanner, Tauzer,
I Adams.
CALIFORNIA — Mathews, Majors,
i Sorrenti.
Mathews and Majors both have bet
ter marks than the Cardinal weight
men, but the former has been ail "in
i and outer" all year. Hanner should
place and lias a good chance for sec
ond.
POLE VAULT
STANFORD—WiIcox, Green, Black.
CALIFORNIA- —Norris, Fish, Dur
gan, Tinkham.
Wilcox with 12:5 to his credit has
the best of it on paper. Norris is a
steady 12:4 man and may provide trou
ble. Green is one of the meet's uncer
tainties. If he is in good shape he has
a chance to win the pole, and score
points in "both the discuss and the high
jump.
HIGH JUMP
STANFORD—Weaver, Heath, Wil
liams, Green.
CALIFORNIA — Muller. Cottrell,
Dalton, Beekhuis.
Muller should win with about four
Cardinals tied for second. Cottrell,
while he has a mark of 6:1, is said to
fall down in competition.
DISCUS
STANFORD — Tauzer, Sampson,
Green, Kirksey.
CALIFORNIA—MuIIer, Berkey, Dal
ton, Majors, Sorrenti, Mohn.
With Tauzer, Sampson, Muller and
Berkey all good for 125 feet it is dif
ficult to pick the winner. Kirksey might
beat them all if he can get a good
heave. Muller and Tauzer look like
the winners.
BROAD JUMP
STANFORD—Minsky, Kirksey, Rus
sell. Shlaudeman, Williams, Anderson.
CALIFORNIA — Muller, Cottrell,
Burgess, Thayer, Holcomb, Bassett.
With Kirksey as an uncertainty, Cali
fornia ha's all the dope on three places.
Muller is good for 22:6 and Burgess
jumps 22 feet. Minsky is handicapped
with a bad ankle.
JAVELIN
ST A N F OR D—Hanner, Green.
CALIFORNIA — Majors, LeHane,
Sorrenti, Muller, Peterson.
Hanner's consistent 180 feet with the
shaft gives him first, despite that fact
that the Bruin fans give it to Majors

by reason of his 182 feet against Mich
igan Saturday. California should take
third.
TRACK FAST
The track is in fast shape for the
"big meet." Coach Templeton gave it
the once over last night, and pro
nounced it in first class condition. Bar
ring bad weather, the existing marks
in the hundred, the quarter and the two
mile should go by the boards.
