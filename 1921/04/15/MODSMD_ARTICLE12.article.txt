# CARD TRACK MEN BATTLE BERKELEY SQUAD TOMORROW
## "DINK" TEMPLETON HOLDS CHARGES IN READINESS FOR SEASON'S CLIMAX HUTCHINSON WITH KIRKSEY IN DASHES IS MEET'S FEATURE 
### E. C. WEST, '23 
Stanford meets the California varsity on the Cardinal oval tomorrow.
When starter Frank Foster calls the milers to their marks at 2 o'clock
the two leading coast universities will contest for supremacy on the track
for the twenty-eighth time, one doped by experts as an overwhelming victor,
the other granted only that time-worn "fighting chance."

California, fresh from a decisive victory over the best the east could
offer, Michigan, is confident. Stanford, its team crippled by loss of men all
through the season and at the last minute Is ready.
Coach "Dink" Templeton, hero of countless athletic contests, has his
men primed for the meet. "Tell 'em we've always got a chance," he said
when asked for a statement last night and with that hurried off to watch one
of his men hurl the discus.
On paper, the meet seems to be but a question of how many points the
Cardinals will be able to roll up against Walter Christie's "wonder team."
California has a decided edge on pre-season performances, the only possible
way for the sports writers to decide the result before the first race has keen
run. ,
Stanford with an even break of luck should score between forty-five and
fifty points, leaving the Bruins approximately eighty-flve digits. Some of the
experts give Templeton's men fifty-five, others only forty.
At any rate the chief interest in tomorrow's meet will probably hinge
on separate events rather than on the ultimate score.
Captain Morris Kirksey, recognized as the second fastest man in the world,
will be pitted against the most capable sprinter California has ever had
when he toes the mark with Bob Hutchinson. The Bruin flash has equaled
Kirksey's marks all during the season and the Card skipper will undoubtedly
be forced to run under even time to break the tape in the hundred.. While
sport followers dope Kirksey to win the shorter race, they claim Hutchinson
has a good chance to takes the furlong. The dashes should offÂ»r the thrills,
of the meet.

Stanford, according to dope, should score heavily in the hurdles. Jess
Wells, last year's captain and intercollegiate low stick champion, is in good
shape again and with Bob Williams and Lane Falk as running mates, ought
to give tie Card point column a flock of digits.

Where Stanford is weak the Bears
seem-. to be strong. With both
Hendrixson and McDonald credited
with running fifty flat in the quarter,
Sprott and Saunders going close to
1:56 in the half, Sprott and Mejia tak
ing turns at winning miles well under
4:30 and Dorr and Denton both sched-

usel to shatter the existing two-mile
mark, Christie's cohorts should talie
practically all the points in these
races.
Art Wilcox and Morris should pro
vide an interesting duel in the pole
vault. Hanner and Majors, the Cali
fornia football captain, seem about
even in the javelin. Tauzer and Mai
ler ought to have a close fight for
first in discus. In the high jump, Mul
ler appears to have the edge although
Heath and Weaver, provided the latter
