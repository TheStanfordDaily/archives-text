# WATER POLO TEAMS MEET TOMORROW
## Varsity Swimmers Will Meet Stockton Neptune Club and Frosh Vie With Oakland 
### 
The water polo teams of Stanford and
California will meet tomorrow morning
at 10 in Encina pool to battle for aqu
atic honors. Both teams are in good
shape, and are both of about the same
strength, so a close battle is expected.

Coach Brandsten announces his line'
up for tomorrow's game to be as fol
lows: Strauss, (Capt.), left forward;
Austin, center forward; Lacey, rigli
forward; Thomas, right back; Stcarn,
center back; Wclch, left back; Ankele,
goal. This combination has been main
tained intact since the beginning of the
quarter, giving a chance for teamwork
to develop. Not much opportunity for
development by means of outside com
petition has been afforded, but constant
practice with the freshman team has
to a large extent taken its place.
An admission price of 25c will be
charged. Ladies are invited to attend
the game. Bleachers around the swim
ming pool will give sufficient seating
capacity for' the "rooting section" that
is expected.
