# THE 						STANFORD OVAL
## 
### 
For the first lime in ten years a California track team comes to the
Stanford oval "doped" to win by a great margin. If they succeed in
annexing a victory tomorrow it will be the first the Blue and Gold ath
letes have taken in the dual meet on the Stanford oval in the last decade.
"Dink" Templeton's men tomorrow will probably have the last oppor
tunity to acid to the excellent record of the present oval, for when the
next dual fight comes to the Stanford farm there should be a large
stadium just below the site of the present battle ground.
We of Stanford are not offering alibis to others for a possible and
even probable defeat this year. Rut we ourselves know what difficulties
Coach Templeton and his men had had to face, and we know that noth
ing but the old "come through" spirit and fight on the part of the men
that we have seen the coach himself exert in the past will roll up a
Stanford point column to look creditable in the public eye. But we
know what "Dink" and his men are good for, and we expect a great
meet tomorrow.
