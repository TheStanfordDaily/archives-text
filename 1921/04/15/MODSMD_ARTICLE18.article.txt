# SENIORS ACT FAVORABLY
## 
### 
In endorsing the senior endowment plan and voting to continue
it this year the class of 1921 should be congratulated on undertaking
a serious program for the interest of Stanford. ,
To secure the maximum benefit from the scheme adopted each
member of the graduating class must be a party to the scheme, and
should come into the game withdut the urging of solicitors.
It is not a question of each class member's assuming an unbearable
obligation. If each takes out a single thousand dollars of insurance the
success of the plan will be complete.
Stanford must have the support of its graduates. No Stanford men
and women have a better opportunity than the present seniors to foster
the strengthening of the solid alumni spirit which is necessary if Stan
ford in the future is to be a strong university. Seniors who appreciate
that they have paid a very small fraction of the expense to which the
University has been put in making of them Stanford men, will want to
leave college having already made a start in the direction of building a
more conscious and active alumni support of the University.
Every man and woman who participates in the endowment scheme
to a small or large extent will leave the campus this spring an active and
material supporter of Stanford.
