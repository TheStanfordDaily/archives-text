### 
Stanford has been bequeathed $50,-
000 for the establishment of a scholar
ship fund in the will of Edmund C.
Converse, New York capitalist, who
died In Pasadena, April 4. The Uni
versity has as yet received no official
notification of the bequest.
The will, which just been made pub
lic, provides that Amherst College
shall receive $200,000 for upkeep and
development of the Converse Memorial
Library, for which he formerly had
contributed $250,000'. Eight other col
leges receive $50,000 for the estab
lishment of funds similar ttv. that at
Stanford. They are Bowdoin, Dart
mouth, Oberlin, Smith, Trinity, Tuske
see, Wells, and Williams.
Converse was not a college man and
no definite reason has been given for
his choosing these universities as his
beneficiaries. They are all of prac
tically the same type, Stanford being
the only one chosen in the West.
The capitalist's education went no
farther than the Boston Latin School,
after which he entered business and
became connected with the steel in
dustry. He later withdrew when the
Steel Corporation was formed and
since then had been connected with
various financial and industrial corpo
rations. He was a member of numer
ous New York fraternal organizations.
