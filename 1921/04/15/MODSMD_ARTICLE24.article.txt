## 
### 
Three events in swimming circles
will hold the center of interest at En
cina pool Saturday morning. The var
sity swimming team, Varsity water
polo team and freshman swimming
team will all face opposition of vary
ing degrees of strength.
Stanford and California will meet in
a water polo contest to begin at 10
a. m. The outcome of this game can
not be predicted with any degree of
certainty. Coach Bransten says his
men are in good shape and have been
doing well lately, but California can
also say the same thing.
The varsity swimming team will go
up against the squad sent down by the
Neptune Swimming Club of Stockton.
As in the case of the Olympic Club
meet Tuesday night, the opposition
will be tough, although less is known
about their point-winners", so it is again
a case of no prediction. The meet will
start at 11 a. m.
A freshman swimming meet will be
the third number on the morning's pro
gram. The '24-squad meets the swim
mers from Oakland Technical High
School. Coach Bransten believes that
chances for victory by the freshmen
are good, as Oakland is not supposed
to have a strong reputation in swim
ming circles. Therefore, without the
unexpected, the freshmen are doped to
win their meet, which will begin at
9 o'clock.
