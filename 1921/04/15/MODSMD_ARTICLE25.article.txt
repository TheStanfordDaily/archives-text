# Prom Tickets Will Be Raffled Off by Theta Chi at Spanish Fiesta
## 
### 
Extra! Prom tickets cost only
twenty cents. Carry a horseshoe on
the hip at the Carnival and the bene
ficient junior class may give you a
chance to attend the greatest dance
of the year for the microscopic sum
of two dimes. Theta Chi has taken
charge of selling Prom tickets at the
Carnival and will raffle them off at
twenty cents a chance. Come early
and avoid the rush. But don't forget,
ye campus snake, that if the dice do
you dirt, you may have the privilege
of buying your tickets Monday, for
the small sum of five dollars and fifty
cents.
