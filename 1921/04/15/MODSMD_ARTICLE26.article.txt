# CARNIVAL CON
## 
### BY W. C. E., '22 
"Topsy Turvy House," the Sigma Nil
concession is one of the most inter
esting of the many that fill the city
of shows. Arranged in the same man
ner as the gigantic barrel that forrrrn
a j-art of the "Jester's Palace" at the
San Francisco Exposition in 1915. the
inside of the revolving house i« dec
orated so that a complete revolution of
the frame reveals to the eye a variety
<>f wondrous things that will de'"ght
the soul of the thrill seeker. The sen
sation that one gets in a trip through
the "Topsy Turvy" is one that will not
be soon forgotten.
"Venetian Garden" is a Lulu
A bit of the old Mediterranean shore
transplanted in the environs of the fes
tival village is the garden that the Chi
Omega's are to run for the satiation of
the fatigued who crave a restful mo
ment in the strenuousness of an eve of
joy and mad merriment. You first,
kind sir? Get out of the way, the pleas
ure is mine.
Greek Gambling Hall a Terror
The Dekes, Delts, and K. As. have
the real low-down awful part of the
shows in their house of reckless aban
don, where the name of Midas is the
pass word and money flows like beer
did at the rallies back in dear old '95.
The old songs about the Greeks having
control of the world's industries holds
good in this instance, and the three will
; have their slickt";t rollers and paste
| board passers on hand to see that the
I house gets the square deal—first.
"Follies Castiliene," some Frolic
Sounds something like soap, but it
ain't. Slick all right, all right, and full
of jaaaaazz et al, and some catchy lit
tle songs and songlets and a chorus of
"belles chartreuse" (pardon the lapse
to French, but the Spanish wouldn't ex
press it). Scenery, for atmosphere they
say, has been coming in by the car load
for the last two days, and the show
must have something wonderful to put
in front of the swell drapes.
Roll Yer Own in This One
"Bring 011 the skate and let her buck,"
as Don Quixote said to Sancho, when
they started out to clean up 011 the
arm wavers. That is what the Phi
Delts and D. Gs. have to offer to those
who would go a fast gait in the ride
for life. Skates uh huh, two per each.
And the beauty of it all is that the
walls arc not far from the center of
the floor and lend a sort of solid sup
port to the backsliders.
The above arc only a few of the i
things that await the curiosity of the I
person desirous of an evening of never 1
to be forgotten and satisfying fun to- ]
i morrow night at the Spanish Fiesta.
