# BRUIN, CARNINAL NINES TANGLE ON LOCAL LOT AGAIN
## Draper Will Do the Hurling For Seay's Nine; Bears' Mound Selection Unknown 
### 
Stanford and California will tangle
for the third time this season on the
local lot tomorrow afternoon, at 3: 3<5,
following the track and field meet.
California has already defeated the
Cardinal nine in two games and there-

fore has the annual series tucked
away but this will not prevent Coach
Seay's gang from attempting to wal
lop the Berkeley team in the final
set-to.
Guy Draper will again essay to beat
the Bruin outfit. Draper pitched a
brand of baseball last Saturday that
ordinarily would have won any con
test but it seemed that Paul O'Neill
heaved a slightly better brand and
won out. Draper, if he turns in the
same kind of pitching tomorrow,


"Doug"
Bundy,
varsity
nine
Skipper
should win on his own diamond.
Either Bundy or Green will do the
receiving and one of them will play
in right field. Bundy has been catch
ing Draper for three years and will
probably go behind the log for part of
the route.
Coach Zamlock has four pitchers
who are all equally good so it is not
known just who will start. O'Neill,
Morrow, Mitchell, and Morse are all
in shape to do the work so "Zam" will
probably do an "eeney-meeney miney
mo" to make his selection. Toomey
will do the catching.
The balance of the two teams will
be the same as in the second game
at Berkeley. Patterson, first base,
Mitchell, second base, Kallam, short
stop, and Heckendorf will make up the
Cardinal infield, while the opposing
inner gardners will be Hermle, first
base, Erb, second base, G. Makin,
shortstop, and H. Makin, third base.
Captain "Moke" Myers, Radebaugh,
and Rowe are the regular Bruin out
fielders. Carver, Kline and Bundy or
Green will do the fly-ball shagging for
Stanford.
With these two teams hitting the old
agate in the manner of which they
are capable and fielding up to the
snuff, the game tomorrow promises
some real entertainment for baseball
lovers.
Jefi Woods an J Burt Burke will call
all the turns.
