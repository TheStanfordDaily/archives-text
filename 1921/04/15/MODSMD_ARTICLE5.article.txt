# BRUIN, CARNINAL NINES TANGLE ON LOCAL LOT AGAIN
## Draper Will Do the Hurling For Seay's Nine; Bears' Mound Selection Unknown 
### 
Stanford and California will tangle
for the third time this season on the
local lot tomorrow afternoon, at 3: 3<5,
following the track and field meet.
California has already defeated the
Cardinal nine in two games and there-

fore has the annual series tucked
away but this will not prevent Coach
Seay's gang from attempting to wal
lop the Berkeley team in the final
set-to.
Guy Draper will again essay to beat
the Bruin outfit. Draper pitched a
brand of baseball last Saturday that
ordinarily would have won any con
test but it seemed that Paul O'Neill
heaved a slightly better brand and
won out. Draper, if he turns in the
same kind of pitching tomorrow,
