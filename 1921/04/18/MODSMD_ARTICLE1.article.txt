in accordance with the agreement be
tween Stanford and Carnegie Corpora
tion, of men of national prominence
representing agricultural, consumer,
economic and other groups of the
community, one of whom will be Mr.
Hoover.
The three directors of the institute
will determine the scientific policies
of the Institute and the problems to be

Alonzo Englebert Taylor, now pro
fessor of physiological chemistry at
the University of Pennsylvania,
through frequent visits to Europe dur
ing and since the war, became prob
ably the world's best informed author
ity on the effect of variations in food
use and diet upon national health and
efficiency. After the United States

ously in both the Department of Agri
culture and the Food Administration.
He was the representative of the Sec
retary of Agriculture on the War Trade
Board and one of Hoover's chief
aides. Even before the United States
entered the war he had visited vari
ous countries at war and obtained
fundamental information regarding
their food resources and the effect of
their comparative aboundance or lack
of food upon their national strength
and efficiency Later as a representa
tive of the Food Administration, and
still later, after the armistice, as a
representative of the American Relief
Administration, ho repeated these
tours of inspection and gained further

chemistry. His training as a teacher
and an administrator of this bureau fit
him particularly to take charge of the
Stanford Food Institute. He is a grad
uate of Columbia University and of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons,
New York City. After several years
of study in Europe and of teaching bio
logical chemistry at Harvard, he was
made biological chemist of the Bureau
of Plant Industry of the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture in 1908, and foyr
years later was advanced to the position
of Chief Chemist of the Department.
Dr. Davis, who will be the economist
of the three directors, is a Harvard man.
He was graduated from that university
in 1908, received his Ph. D. there in
1914, and is now assistant professor of
economics there. He is one of the most
accomplished of the younger American
economics scholars, and is especially
well qualified in the field of statistics
and business corporations and combina
tions. During the war he served with
the American Shipping Mission in
Europe connected with the Allied Mari
time Council, and continued similar
work after the armistice. Later he re
sumed his teaching at Harvard, but has
recently been in Europe again. He is
Contributing editor of the Harvard Re
view of Economics Statistics, a publica
tion which forecasts business conditions.
His principal published work is a two
valume study of the early history of
American corporations.

in 1908, received his Ph. D. there in
1914, and is now assistant professor of
economics there. He is one of the most
accomplished of the younger American
economics scholars, and is especially
well qualified in the field of statistics
and business corporations and combina
tions. During the war he served with
the American Shipping Mission in
Europe connected with the Allied Mari
time Council, and continued similar
work after the armistice. Later he re
sumed his teaching at Harvard, but has

President Ray Lyman Wilbur today
anuounced the complete personnel of
the directorate of the Stanford Food
Research Institute which on July 1
will take up the intensive and con
tinuing study of the problems of the
production, distribution, and consump
tion of food upon the endowment of
$700,000 which Carnegie Corporation
of New York has provided for the
first ten years of the work.
The three directors will be Dr.
Alonzo Englebert v Taylor, the well
known authority on the nutritional
and economic phases of food in na
tional life, Dr. Carl Lucas Alsberg, at
present Chief Chemist of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture, and Dr.
Joseph Stancliffe Davis, who is a
jnember of the economics faculty of
Harvard University.
President Wilbur also announced
members of the Advisory Committee
of the Food Institute. Besides Dr.
James R. Angell, president of Carnegie
Corporation, Dr. Wilbur, President of
Stanford, who are ex-officio members,
and Herbert Hoover, who was speci
fied in the original agreement, the
members of the Advisory Committee
are: William M. Jardine, president of
Kansas State Agricultural College; A.
R. Howard, president of the Farm
Bureau, the national farmers' organi
zation; Dr. J. C. Merriam, president
of the Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington, I). C., and recently a member
of the University of California faculty,
George C. Roeding, formerly of the
California Horticultural Commission,
and Julius Barnes, formerly U. S.
Wheat Director and president of the
U. S. urain Corporation, and an au
thority on transportation and distri
bution methods.
This Advisory Committee, which will
from time to time confer with the
directors of the Institute, is made up,
in accordance with the agreement be
tween Stanford and Carnegie Corpora
tion, of men of national prominence
representing agricultural, consumer,
economic and other groups of the
community, one of whom will be Mr.
Hoover.
The three directors of the institute
will determine the scientific policies
of the Institute and the problems to be
studied. Each of them will head a
division of the work, Dr. Taylor in the
field of physiology and the chemistry
of nutrition. Dr. Alsberg in the field
of the chemistry of food manufacture
and agriculture, and Dr. Davis in the
field .of economics and food distribu
tion. They will work co-operatively to
cover the whole subject of the produc
tion, distribution and consumption of
food.
Alonzo Englebert Taylor, now pro
fessor of physiological chemistry at
the University of Pennsylvania,
through frequent visits to Europe dur
ing and since the war, became prob
ably the world's best informed author
ity on the effect of variations in food
use and diet upon national health and
efficiency. After the United States
entered the war he served simultane
ously in both the Department of Agri
culture and the Food Administration.
He was the representative of the Sec
retary of Agriculture on the War Trade
Board and one of Hoover's chief
aides. Even before the United States
entered the war he had visited vari
ous countries at war and obtained
fundamental information regarding
their food resources and the effect of
their comparative aboundance or lack
of food upon their national strength
and efficiency Later as a representa
tive of the Food Administration, and
still later, after the armistice, as a
representative of the American Relief
Administration, ho repeated these
tours of inspection and gained further
data. The results of these studies have
been published in official documents,
in book form, and also in a large num
ber of articles in various magazines.
He is ot present in Europe, hut will
return to America soon. Ho is the
author, also, of a number of scienti

Dr. Alsberg, who is Chief of the
Bureau of Chemistry of the Department
of Agriculture, is an authority on bio
chemistry. His training as a teacher
and an administrator of this bureau fit
him particularly to take charge of the
Stanford Food Institute. He is a grad
uate of Columbia University and of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons,
New York City. After several years
of study in Europe and of teaching bio
logical chemistry at Harvard, he was
made biological chemist of the Bureau
of Plant Industry of the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture in 1908, and foyr
years later was advanced to the position
of Chief Chemist of the Department.

and an administrator of this bureau fit
him particularly to take charge of the
Stanford Food Institute. He is a grad
uate of Columbia University and of the
College of Physicians and Surgeons,
New York City. After several years
of study in Europe and of teaching bio
logical chemistry at Harvard, he was
made biological chemist of the Bureau
of Plant Industry of the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture in 1908, and foyr
years later was advanced to the position
of Chief Chemist of the Department.
Dr. Davis, who will be the economist
of the three directors, is a Harvard man.
He was graduated from that university
in 1908, received his Ph. D. there in
1914, and is now assistant professor of
economics there. He is one of the most
accomplished of the younger American
economics scholars, and is especially
well qualified in the field of statistics
and business corporations and combina
tions. During the war he served with
the American Shipping Mission in
Europe connected with the Allied Mari
time Council, and continued similar
work after the armistice. Later he re
sumed his teaching at Harvard, but has
recently been in Europe again. He is
Contributing editor of the Harvard Re
view of Economics Statistics, a publica
tion which forecasts business conditions.
His principal published work is a two
valume study of the early history of
American corporations.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur today
anuounced the complete personnel of
the directorate of the Stanford Food
Research Institute which on July 1
will take up the intensive and con
tinuing study of the problems of the
production, distribution, and consump
tion of food upon the endowment of
$700,000 which Carnegie Corporation
of New York has provided for the
first ten years of the work.
The three directors will be Dr.
Alonzo Englebert v Taylor, the well
known authority on the nutritional
and economic phases of food in na
tional life, Dr. Carl Lucas Alsberg, at
present Chief Chemist of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture, and Dr.
Joseph Stancliffe Davis, who is a
jnember of the economics faculty of
Harvard University.
President Wilbur also announced
members of the Advisory Committee
of the Food Institute. Besides Dr.
James R. Angell, president of Carnegie
Corporation, Dr. Wilbur, President of
Stanford, who are ex-officio members,
and Herbert Hoover, who was speci
fied in the original agreement, the
members of the Advisory Committee
are: William M. Jardine, president of
Kansas State Agricultural College; A.
R. Howard, president of the Farm
Bureau, the national farmers' organi
zation; Dr. J. C. Merriam, president
of the Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington, I). C., and recently a member
of the University of California faculty,
George C. Roeding, formerly of the
California Horticultural Commission,
and Julius Barnes, formerly U. S.
Wheat Director and president of the
U. S. urain Corporation, and an au
thority on transportation and distri
bution methods.
This Advisory Committee, which will
from time to time confer with the
directors of the Institute, is made up,
in accordance with the agreement be
tween Stanford and Carnegie Corpora
tion, of men of national prominence
representing agricultural, consumer,
economic and other groups of the
community, one of whom will be Mr.
Hoover.
The three directors of the institute
will determine the scientific policies
of the Institute and the problems to be
studied. Each of them will head a
division of the work, Dr. Taylor in the
field of physiology and the chemistry
of nutrition. Dr. Alsberg in the field
of the chemistry of food manufacture
and agriculture, and Dr. Davis in the
field .of economics and food distribu
tion. They will work co-operatively to
cover the whole subject of the produc
tion, distribution and consumption of
food.
Alonzo Englebert Taylor, now pro
fessor of physiological chemistry at
the University of Pennsylvania,
through frequent visits to Europe dur
ing and since the war, became prob
ably the world's best informed author
ity on the effect of variations in food
use and diet upon national health and
efficiency. After the United States
entered the war he served simultane
ously in both the Department of Agri
culture and the Food Administration.
He was the representative of the Sec
retary of Agriculture on the War Trade
Board and one of Hoover's chief
aides. Even before the United States
entered the war he had visited vari
ous countries at war and obtained
fundamental information regarding
their food resources and the effect of
their comparative aboundance or lack
of food upon their national strength
and efficiency Later as a representa
tive of the Food Administration, and
still later, after the armistice, as a
representative of the American Relief
Administration, ho repeated these
tours of inspection and gained further
data. The results of these studies have
been published in official documents,
in book form, and also in a large num
ber of articles in various magazines.
He is ot present in Europe, hut will
return to America soon. Ho is the
author, also, of a number of scienti
fic works on the physiological aspect
of food and digestion. Dr. Taylor has
Jived in California before, having
been professor of pathology at the
University of California from 1899 to
1910.
