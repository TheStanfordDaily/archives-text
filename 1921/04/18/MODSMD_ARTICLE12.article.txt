# THIRD GAME OF SERIES GOES TO BERKELEY NINE
## Wild Game on Wet Diamond Lost by Score of 11 to 0; Draper Allows Twelve Hits 
### 
California ma le a clean sweep of the
three game baseball series by walloping
Coach Seay's Ci»d ; nal nine 11 to '3 in
the t.nal bat f le on the Stanford diamond
Saturday afcernccn. The conje-t was
staged on a wet field and wit': the aid
of quantities of sawdust and oodles of
new baseballs the eighteen players
managed to sM.ggU. through nine in
nings- of the wildest, weirdest baseball
that has been foisted on the root _■ s in a
long time. Ku<" the rooters fooled
them, there w;re not very manv on hand
due to the rainfall before tlv pme so
the teams had things pretty much to
themselves. Especially the Bruins, who
pounded the offer ngs of Draper, who
did mound duty for the Cardinal,
hither and yon, making twelve blows
oft his delivery.
Morse heaved for the Bruins and
while he seemed to be suffering from a
bad case of nerves at the outset managed
to pitch through the nine innings with
only six hits being made off him. He
v.orc a worried look on his face through
out the game but he need not have
feared, for the Stanford tossers did not
have on their hitting togs.
Morse wobbled in the fifth inning
when Hcckendorf led off with a bingle
into right field, and he walked Hundy
and Draper choking the paths. Mitchell
hit to G. Makin at short who threw
Heckendorf out at the plate and then
the boy heaver settled down, retiring
Kallam on strikes and forcing Green to
pop a fly to short stop.
Coach Zamloch's gang scored in the
first inning when Hermle got a hold on
one of Draper's twists and sent it up
against the center field bleachers for
three cushions. G. Makin scored him
with a two base hit into left field.
From then on California scored fre
quently and Draper was kept in hot wa
ter continually. Either his team erred
behind him or the Bruins hit his of
ferings hard and between the two, the
big Stanford hurler had a turbulent af
ternoon. Kelly relieved Draper in the
ninth inning and the Bears chased over
the eleventh tally of the game with two
clean hits.

California ma le a clean sweep of the
three game baseball series by walloping
Coach Seay's Ci»d ; nal nine 11 to '3 in
the t.nal bat f le on the Stanford diamond
Saturday afcernccn. The conje-t was
staged on a wet field and wit': the aid
of quantities of sawdust and oodles of
new baseballs the eighteen players
managed to sM.ggU. through nine in
nings- of the wildest, weirdest baseball
that has been foisted on the root _■ s in a
long time. Ku<" the rooters fooled
them, there w;re not very manv on hand
due to the rainfall before tlv pme so
the teams had things pretty much to
themselves. Especially the Bruins, who
pounded the offer ngs of Draper, who
did mound duty for the Cardinal,
hither and yon, making twelve blows
oft his delivery.
Morse heaved for the Bruins and
while he seemed to be suffering from a
bad case of nerves at the outset managed
to pitch through the nine innings with
only six hits being made off him. He
v.orc a worried look on his face through
out the game but he need not have
feared, for the Stanford tossers did not
have on their hitting togs.
Morse wobbled in the fifth inning
when Hcckendorf led off with a bingle
into right field, and he walked Hundy
and Draper choking the paths. Mitchell
hit to G. Makin at short who threw
Heckendorf out at the plate and then
the boy heaver settled down, retiring
Kallam on strikes and forcing Green to
pop a fly to short stop.
Coach Zamloch's gang scored in the
first inning when Hermle got a hold on
one of Draper's twists and sent it up
against the center field bleachers for
three cushions. G. Makin scored him
with a two base hit into left field.
From then on California scored fre
quently and Draper was kept in hot wa
ter continually. Either his team erred
behind him or the Bruins hit his of
ferings hard and between the two, the
big Stanford hurler had a turbulent af
ternoon. Kelly relieved Draper in the
ninth inning and the Bears chased over
the eleventh tally of the game with two
clean hits.
