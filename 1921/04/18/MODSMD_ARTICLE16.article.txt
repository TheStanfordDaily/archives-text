### 
With llie appointment of Dr. Alonzo Englebert Taylor, widely
known writer and authority on economic phases of food in national life,
Dr. Carl Lucas Alsberg, Chief Chemist of the Department of Agricul
ture, and Dr. Joseph Stancliffe Davis of Harvard, as chief figures in the
new Carnegie Food Institute, this latest addition to the Stanford educa
tional system takes even larger proportions as a foundation of great im
portance. These three men are recognized authorities and known to
be of the most able in the field of food and economics. The importance
of scientific information and data on the food factor in national eco
nomics has come to be fully realized only with the accomplishments of
tiie Hoover organization during the war. Such competent men as Tay
lor, Alsberg, and Davis in conducting research with the incomparable
Hoover collection of original material and other Stanford facilities at
hand, should be able to throw new light on food questions and problems
that will be of great influence in the economic progress of the nation.
