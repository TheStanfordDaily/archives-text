# WOMEN'S COUNCIL
## 
### 
The women of the University tomorrow elect the council which
acts for them in women's disciplinary matters. Always an important
election, the balloting tomorrow will have added significance in that the
council chosen will be the first to act with Miss Elizabeth Hogue, newly
appointed Dean of Women.
Women who are interested in the regulations and provisions govern
ing their conduct at Stanford may take care that members are placed on
the council who are best able to represent their viewpoint in disciplinary
and other matters with which they and the Dean of Women must deal.

THE STUDENT BODY AUTHORITIES ;uy to be commended on
stopping the freshman-sophomore baseball fight preliminaries which gave
promise of going far beyond the rules of the contest. Such underclass
scraps must be governed by reasonable rules, and a proper observance of
them should be secured by student body officials, by serious action if
necessary.

STUDENTS WHO INTEND to use the cards distributed at the stadi
um-track rally should place names upon them and mail to the Board of
Control while that body may make use of them. A return of an appre
ciable number of cards may aid materially in financing the bowl, but they
must be mailed now to accomplish the desired purpose.
