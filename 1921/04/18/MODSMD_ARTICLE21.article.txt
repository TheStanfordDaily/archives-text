# NEW CURTAINS WILL GRACE ASSEMBLY BY EFFORTS OF DAVIS
## 
### 
Plans for the new gijey drop curtains
for the Assembly Hall are being, not
only seriously considered, but the
measurements for them have been
taken, the price set, material selected,
and the next step is to order "them,
which will be done just as soon as tke
box office receipts come in from the
show next Thursday night. These
drops will then be ready to be used
in the Junior Opera, next month, mak
ing their first appearance in the Mo
diste Shop scene. Curtains are being
used to a large extent now in theat
ricals and the old wings and scenery
are fast loosing their popularity in
face of it.
Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn are
doing a great deal in their efforts to
help us secure these curtain√ü by giv
ing us the cream of their dances at
a low price. Others are doing their
bit to help the cause, as all the labor
and stage-hand work is being given
gratis and the Commercitl Art Class
of Emil Grebs is making large deco
rative posters that will be placed
about the campus and in Palo Alto,
Tuesday afternoon of next week.
