# POLO TEAM TO MEET SAN MATEO SQUAD ON SATURDAY, APRIL 23
## 
### 
The first polo game of the season
will be played a week from Saturday,
April 23, with the San Mateo Polo
Club at Clark Field, San Mateo. The
tentative line-up for Stanford is: Cal
vert L. Cecil (Capt.) Paul H. Talbert,
Richard W. FavilJe and James Quinby.
The squadron showed up very well in
a recent practice game with the Del
Monte 11th Cavalry Polo team.
The Stanford team is not expected to
outclass the San Mateo players, as the
former lack the essential experience
necessary to beat a squad that has been
playing often, and has a reputation of
being a strong outfit. More games will
be scheduled for later on in the sea-
