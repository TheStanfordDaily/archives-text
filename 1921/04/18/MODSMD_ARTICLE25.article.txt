Will Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford
and Lydia Pinkham kindly take a hack
seat while we present a real benefactor
of mankind? The hero to this touching
example of devotion to Alma Mater is
none other than Gordon Arthur Davis
'18, faculty dramatic coach and confi
dante, of stage celehraties. Though lie
walks with the stars his thoughts are
never cloudy, as our story shows.
Last Tuesday Ted Shawn was down
(Hi the campus explaining to the Dram
atic workshop class how a person can
be both a man and good looking. After
the lecture, Davis, with his. usual retic
ence proceeded to engage him in con
versation and the topic of the confab
was the amount of money which would
he taken in at the Ruth St. Dennis-Ted
Shawn entertainment next Thursday
night.
Our worthy coact became very enthus
iastic over the prospect and in the ex
huberance of his optimism Mr. Shawn
that he would play to a thousand dollar
house. Ted Shawn thanked him for the
compliment but said that if the show
took in that amount lie would present
Davis with a copy of this autographed
two volme, forty dollars a set, erition of
"Ruth St. Denis—Pioneer and Prophet."
Then with a magnificient gesture of
self sacrifice Davis proudly shook his
head and said "No. Give it to the Uni
versity Library."
Thus the edition which has been
creating so much tolk in the Bookstore
may yet stay upon the campus. If it
does we may thank what ever gods may
be, whotever pleasure seekers are lucky
enough to make up that thousand dol
lar quota, whatever else we can think
of—and Gordon Davis.
