# Dr. Adams Outlines New Phase of Honor System
## 
### 
Professor E. D. Adams, in discussing
the honor system, this morning brought,
forward an aspect of its adoption which,
he said, he had not previously seen
discussed. After declaring him>elf em
phaticallv in favor of the honor system
in examinations, he showed its relation
which provides that 15 per cent of the
students passing in a given course be
given A, 35 per cent H. 35 per cent 'J
and 15 per cent D.
He pointed out that the student who
cheats is not alone affected, but that
such a student, by cheating, may push
himself up fiom the C group into the
B group, thus forcing down th * student
who has played fair but who hovers on
the borderline between the two grades.
For overy student whose mark is raised
bv unfair work on his part there is an
other student whose mark is lowered
through no faui'. of his own. This fact
;.Â»Ms to the responsibility of those de
tect : ng others in the process ot 'illegally
acquiring information.'
