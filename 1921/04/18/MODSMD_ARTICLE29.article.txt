# ED. H. LOCKWOOD NOW REPRESENTING STANFORD IN EAST
## 
### 
For the past six years Stanford has
been supporting Edward H. Lockwood
as Secretary of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association in Canton, China, and
in order to continue this work afund
will be started a week from Monday
to maintain him in this position. In
1913 he came to Stanford from the
Pittsburg Y. M. C. A. and from here in
1915 he was sent as a representative of
Stanford to carry on the Christian work
being done in the Orient.
Mr. Lockwood is one of the "Y" sec
retarys who are sent over by the pro
gresive universities om this country at
their expense to hanrle the missionary
work being done by that organization
in the East. The money for his sup
port which is to be collected in the som
ing drive maintains a large Christian
College in China and Princeton keeps
five alumni engaged in foreign christian
work. Canadian college students aver
age $1.50 a piece for this same purpose.
To come nearer home, California has
subscribed $5,300 for the maintenance
of their representative. This is much
better than Stanford has done so far
but Dr. Morgan of the local Y. M. C. A.
is confident that the result of the ap
proaching campaign will bring a result
which will approximate that size.
Mr. Lockwood is a graduate of De
Pauw and an able scholar. The Y. M.
C. A. in which he is working is one of
the higgest in China, carrying an an
nual budget of $51,000 which is totally
subscribed by the Chinese. It has an
active membership of 2,200 and has been
making a large percentage of converts
from these in the past few years. No
less than 500 men in private and ad
ministrative life made the decision for
Christian life last year. It is this work
which Mr. Lockwood is doing and con
sequently it is this end towards which
all subscriptions wil be used.
