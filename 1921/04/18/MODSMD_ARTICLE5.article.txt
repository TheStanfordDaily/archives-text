# FIESTA PROVES WISDOM OF TWO DAY SHOW PLAN
## Concessions Run Second Night Give Chance for Outsiders to Enjoy Evening's Pleasure 
### W. C. Evans, '22 
From the coronation address on Friday
night to the "Home Sweet Home," of
the Carnival Hall at midnight Saturday
the Spanish Carnival was a success in
every way. In spite of the rain which
threatened Saturday afternoon to make
the second night impossible the conces
sionaires came back for the evening's
gaiety and made it an even larger night
than the first.
Friday the concessions opened accord
ing to schedule after the crowning of
the king and queen and ran until about
10:30. The crowd that filled the streets
of the Spanish village was larger than
had been anticipated and taxed the
limits of the concession booths to the ut
most. Every concession on the zone
was in full blast and the throng of
pleasure seekers passed down the ave
nues from one to another. Every kind
of show had a representative among
the number that were on the gay white
way, and unlimited diversion awaited
the curious.
It would be impossible to tell at length
of the merits of all the shows. Some,
that because of their novelty or the
amount of work put on them, were ex
ceedingly good and would have taken
a prominent place in any professional
carnival. The "Topsy Turvy House,"
Sigma Nil's entry was probably the most
unique of the concessions. The work
expended in the erection of the great
whirling cube that housed the show was
done with a nicety of skill that would
have been hard to beat, and the revalv
ing cage worked perfectly all through
the fiesta.
For completness of detail the "Spanish
Cafe," of the I). U.'s and Alpha Phi's
was a winner. The low varicolored
ceiling, with the pretty Spanish gowns
on the dancing girls, and the appropriate
music made a combination that was
thoroughly satisfying to all who entered
the place. A straight show, well put
on and with perfect costuming, was the
prize offering of the Alpha Delts and Pi
Phis. \ combination of fancy dancing,
beauty chorus, and a tableau scene in
connection with song, made up the play
that won the trophy cup for the best
concession.
Ram's Head with their songs and
dancing proved a hit of both evenings.
The chorus showed the results cf the
experienced directing of the society's
nemtiMS and put over the songs and
dance.- in a manner that left nothing
tc. be dtsired. Frances Merrill, P~g
Wealton and Jack Hefferna/i. backed up
by Nathanson and his musical pipe,
brought down 'he house with their song
r timbers.
The Ball Saturday night proved to
be a great success in spni of the ran.
'I he ma n room of the gymnasium was
packed to capacity with dancing couples
until midnight, finishing the fiesta
with a good time for everyone con
cerned.

From the coronation address on Friday
night to the "Home Sweet Home," of
the Carnival Hall at midnight Saturday
the Spanish Carnival was a success in
every way. In spite of the rain which
threatened Saturday afternoon to make
the second night impossible the conces
sionaires came back for the evening's
gaiety and made it an even larger night
than the first.
Friday the concessions opened accord
ing to schedule after the crowning of
the king and queen and ran until about
10:30. The crowd that filled the streets
of the Spanish village was larger than
had been anticipated and taxed the
limits of the concession booths to the ut
most. Every concession on the zone
was in full blast and the throng of
pleasure seekers passed down the ave
nues from one to another. Every kind
of show had a representative among
the number that were on the gay white
way, and unlimited diversion awaited
the curious.
It would be impossible to tell at length
of the merits of all the shows. Some,
that because of their novelty or the
amount of work put on them, were ex
ceedingly good and would have taken
a prominent place in any professional
carnival. The "Topsy Turvy House,"
Sigma Nil's entry was probably the most
unique of the concessions. The work
expended in the erection of the great
whirling cube that housed the show was
done with a nicety of skill that would
have been hard to beat, and the revalv
ing cage worked perfectly all through
the fiesta.
For completness of detail the "Spanish
Cafe," of the I). U.'s and Alpha Phi's
was a winner. The low varicolored
ceiling, with the pretty Spanish gowns
on the dancing girls, and the appropriate
music made a combination that was
thoroughly satisfying to all who entered
the place. A straight show, well put
on and with perfect costuming, was the
prize offering of the Alpha Delts and Pi
Phis. \ combination of fancy dancing,
