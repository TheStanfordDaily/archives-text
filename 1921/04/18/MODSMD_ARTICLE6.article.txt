### 
The Cardinal water polo team
swamped the Blue and Gold seven, 13 3,
Saturday afternoon in the Encina pool.
From the start it was apparent that
Coach Brandsten's men completely out
classed the invaders, and at no time
after the first few minutes did Califor
nia seem to have a chance.
Stanford scored the first goal, and this
was followed by a California marker.
But from this time on it was all Stan
ford. The close o.f the first half found
the score 5-2, and in the second frame
the game became even more one-sided.
Better condition and better teamwork
told the story. California's men, de
spite the fact that their training period
had been longer without interruption
were not in good enough condition to
stand the fast pace, and their teamwork
was not good enough to give them a
chance. Coach Brandsten's men, on the
other hand, showed themselves to be in
good shape, and individual starring was
subordinated to teamwork. In the for
ward line Austin and Strauss scored the
most points. The backfield kept away
any California offensive that developed
from time to time.
