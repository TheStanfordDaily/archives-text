# RAIN FAILS TO STOP RECORD BREAKERS IN MEET WITH BRUINS
## Hanner and Dorr Smash Marks in Javelin and Two-Mile; Kenny Wright and Black Upset Dope 
### E. C. West, '23 
California won the twenty-eighth annual "Big Meet" with Stanford, 85 2-3
to 45 1-3 points.
Despite the drizzling rain which sogged the track and field making good
times and marks for the most part impossible, thousands were in the bleach
ers to see Walter Christie's "wonder team" run true to dope and win over
"Dink" Templeton's Cardinal athletes.
Overcoming the disadvantage of a wet track, Rorr of the Bruins set up
a new Stanford-California record in the two-mile when he traveled the eight
laps in 9:47.1... The former mark was 9:54. Hendrixson of California equaled
the quarter-mile record of fifty flat... Flint Hanner shattered his own mark
In the javelin with a heave of 170 feet 8 inches and "Brick" Muller, who was
the highest individual point-winner broke the old discus mark with a heave
of 121 feet 8 inches.. Captain Morris Kirksey of Stanford ran the century in
10 seconds flat which ties the existing record.
Kirksey had a little difficulty in breaking the tape ahead of Hutchinson,
the Bruin flash. The Stanford skipper was four feet ahead in the hundred
and despite a poor start in the furlong which enabled Hutchinson to hold the
lead for 150 yards, won the longer race with a yard to spare.
The best and closest race of the day was th® quarter-mile. "Ken" Wright,
given an outside chance for a third place by the experts, got the pole and held
it around the first turn. On the straightaway in front of the California bleach-

ers he surprised everyone by running
away from both Hendrixson and Mc-
Donald, who were slated to have an
easy time of it. Hendrixson managed
to come abreast of the Cardinal run
ner twenty yeards from the finish and
in that laßt few seconds forged ahead
a few inches. McDonald finished a
poor third.
Wright also showed his class in the
relay when he started several yards
behind Hendrixson and finished the
race less than two feet behind. Bob
Wright proved that he had a better
finish than McDonald in the third lap
when he picked up on ihe Bruin on the
straightaway.
The other surprise of the meet came
when Bill Blai-k tied "Red" Norris of
California in the pole vault at twelve
feet. Wilcox and Green tied for third.
Black's mark stamps him as a promis
ing vaulter for the next two years.
For the most part the results fol
lowed pretty closely the pre meet
dope sheet. California made a clean
sweep in the half, the mile, the two
mile, the shot and the broad jump.
Stanford took firsts in both the hurd
les, Bob Williams cleaning up in the
highs and Jess Wells the lows. Wells
took third in the high sticks and Lane
Falk pulled a close second in the lows
to last year's captain.
Flint Hanner came through with his
usual first place in the javelin. Majors,
whom the Bruin fans expected to de
feat the Stanford star, failed to place,
both Sorrenti and Muller, his team
mates beating him out.
Muller of the Bears managed to
squeeze out a first in the discus over
"Red" Tauzer and Dick Sampson, of
the Cardinals.
Bob Williams furnished Muller with
plenty of competition in the high
jump, forcing the Olympic Games star
to his limit. Williams cleared six
feet two inches but Muller came
through in the pinch and went an inch
higher.

Kirksey had a little difficulty in breaking the tape ahead of Hutchinson,
the Bruin flash. The Stanford skipper was four feet ahead in the hundred
and despite a poor start in the furlong which enabled Hutchinson to hold the
lead for 150 yards, won the longer race with a yard to spare.
The best and closest race of the day was th® quarter-mile. "Ken" Wright,
given an outside chance for a third place by the experts, got the pole and held
it around the first turn. On the straightaway in front of the California bleach-

ers he surprised everyone by running
away from both Hendrixson and Mc-
Donald, who were slated to have an
easy time of it. Hendrixson managed
to come abreast of the Cardinal run
ner twenty yeards from the finish and
in that laßt few seconds forged ahead
a few inches. McDonald finished a
poor third.
Wright also showed his class in the
relay when he started several yards
behind Hendrixson and finished the
race less than two feet behind. Bob
Wright proved that he had a better
finish than McDonald in the third lap
when he picked up on ihe Bruin on the
straightaway.
The other surprise of the meet came
when Bill Blai-k tied "Red" Norris of
California in the pole vault at twelve
feet. Wilcox and Green tied for third.
Black's mark stamps him as a promis
ing vaulter for the next two years.
For the most part the results fol
lowed pretty closely the pre meet
dope sheet. California made a clean
sweep in the half, the mile, the two
mile, the shot and the broad jump.
Stanford took firsts in both the hurd
les, Bob Williams cleaning up in the
highs and Jess Wells the lows. Wells
took third in the high sticks and Lane
Falk pulled a close second in the lows
to last year's captain.
Flint Hanner came through with his
usual first place in the javelin. Majors,
whom the Bruin fans expected to de
feat the Stanford star, failed to place,
both Sorrenti and Muller, his team
mates beating him out.
Muller of the Bears managed to
squeeze out a first in the discus over
"Red" Tauzer and Dick Sampson, of
the Cardinals.
Bob Williams furnished Muller with
plenty of competition in the high
jump, forcing the Olympic Games star
to his limit. Williams cleared six
feet two inches but Muller came
through in the pinch and went an inch
higher.

Black's mark stamps him as a promis
ing vaulter for the next two years.
For the most part the results fol
lowed pretty closely the pre meet
dope sheet. California made a clean
sweep in the half, the mile, the two
mile, the shot and the broad jump.
Stanford took firsts in both the hurd
les, Bob Williams cleaning up in the
highs and Jess Wells the lows. Wells
took third in the high sticks and Lane
Falk pulled a close second in the lows
to last year's captain.
Flint Hanner came through with his
usual first place in the javelin. Majors,
whom the Bruin fans expected to de
feat the Stanford star, failed to place,
both Sorrenti and Muller, his team
mates beating him out.
Muller of the Bears managed to
squeeze out a first in the discus over
"Red" Tauzer and Dick Sampson, of
the Cardinals.
Bob Williams furnished Muller with
plenty of competition in the high
jump, forcing the Olympic Games star
to his limit. Williams cleared six
feet two inches but Muller came
through in the pinch and went an inch
higher.

California won the twenty-eighth annual "Big Meet" with Stanford, 85 2-3
to 45 1-3 points.
Despite the drizzling rain which sogged the track and field making good
times and marks for the most part impossible, thousands were in the bleach
ers to see Walter Christie's "wonder team" run true to dope and win over
"Dink" Templeton's Cardinal athletes.
Overcoming the disadvantage of a wet track, Rorr of the Bruins set up
a new Stanford-California record in the two-mile when he traveled the eight
laps in 9:47.1... The former mark was 9:54. Hendrixson of California equaled
the quarter-mile record of fifty flat... Flint Hanner shattered his own mark
In the javelin with a heave of 170 feet 8 inches and "Brick" Muller, who was
the highest individual point-winner broke the old discus mark with a heave
of 121 feet 8 inches.. Captain Morris Kirksey of Stanford ran the century in
10 seconds flat which ties the existing record.
Kirksey had a little difficulty in breaking the tape ahead of Hutchinson,
the Bruin flash. The Stanford skipper was four feet ahead in the hundred
and despite a poor start in the furlong which enabled Hutchinson to hold the
lead for 150 yards, won the longer race with a yard to spare.
The best and closest race of the day was th® quarter-mile. "Ken" Wright,
given an outside chance for a third place by the experts, got the pole and held
it around the first turn. On the straightaway in front of the California bleach-

ers he surprised everyone by running
away from both Hendrixson and Mc-
Donald, who were slated to have an
easy time of it. Hendrixson managed
to come abreast of the Cardinal run
ner twenty yeards from the finish and
in that laßt few seconds forged ahead
a few inches. McDonald finished a
poor third.
Wright also showed his class in the
relay when he started several yards
behind Hendrixson and finished the
race less than two feet behind. Bob
Wright proved that he had a better
finish than McDonald in the third lap
when he picked up on ihe Bruin on the
straightaway.
The other surprise of the meet came
when Bill Blai-k tied "Red" Norris of
California in the pole vault at twelve
feet. Wilcox and Green tied for third.
Black's mark stamps him as a promis
ing vaulter for the next two years.
