# CARDINALS MAY MEET O.A.C. ON STANFORD OVAL
## Templeton Hopes to Send Fast Squad East to Compete in National Intercollegiates 
### 
Stanford may meet the Oregon Ag
gies in track on the Cardinal oval, the
firßt Saturday in May, according to an
nouncement from tho graduate mana
ger's office today. Terms were wired
north several days ago and it is ex
pected that the meet will be arranged.
Aside from the meet with the Ag
gies, there are two other possible
competitive affairs for "Dink" Temple
ton's men to participate in, before the
curtain is drawn on track for the
remainder cf the year. The Pacific
Coast Conference meet, won by Cali
fornia here last year, is set for May 21
at Eugene, Oregon. The I. C. A. A. A.
A., in which athletes from all the lead
ing co'leges in the United States com
pete, is scheduled for Harvard Stadi
um the following wee*.
Coach Templeton said today that
there seemed more probability of the
Cardinal stars going East to enter tho
national intercollegiates at Harvard,
than of competing in the conference
affair.
Last year Stanford sent Kirksey,
Wells and Templeton east and despite
the fact that Kirksey pulled a tendon
which disqualified him from taking
two certain first places, the Cards
finished well in the running.
Should Kirksey go east there seems
little doubt that that he will take first
in both the century and furlong, as
Paddock, the only runner in the coun
try who seems capable of taking hi 3
measure, will not compete. Williams
and Wells should finish well in the
hurdles and Art Wilcox, in his best
form, should place in the pole. Flint
Hunner would probably not make the
trip as the javelin is not included in
the list of events this year. Due to
his sensational showing
Bruins in the big meet, Kenny Wright
is also a strong prospect for the east
ern tour.
Coach Walter Christie will take ten
of his victorious California athletes
east to enter the Western Conference
and also the National Intercollegiates.
Muller, Sprott, Hendrixson, Hutchin
son and Norris all seem to have a good
chance of placing in both meets.
