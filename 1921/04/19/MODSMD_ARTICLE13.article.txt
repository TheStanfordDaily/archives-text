# HONOR SYSTEM IS CONFERENCE TOPIC
## Professor Green and Student Committee Consider Way of Introducing Principles 
### 
Professor It. L. Green of the Mathe
matics department, chairman of the
sub committee of the Academic Coun
cil that is investigating the honor
system preparatory to its installation
here, is conferring today with the
student committee on some of the de
tails of the plan.
The honor system was referred by
President Wilbur to the Academic
Council some time ago, and they have
taken up an extensive investigation
to determine the best way of putting
it into effect at Stanford and then the
best way of perpetuating it after it
has been once installed. Several plans
for the more detailed part of the
workings of the governing body that
will control the violators have been
worked out but none Beem entirely
satisfactory. With the settlement of
this problem in mind the committee
that is headed by Professor Green has
appointed to get a more compre
hensive understanding of the plan as
advocated and turn this into the Aca
demic Council at a later meeting.
Marion Kyle, '18, Chairman of the
Students' Committee on the honor sys
tem is representing the student side
of the question today. Kyle has got
ten together all the facts pertinent to
the question and it seems sure that
p definite plan of action will be reached
as a result of the conference today .
All the bodies that have reviewed
the honor system so far have reported
on it practically unanimously. Before
the end of the present quarter there
is a possibility that the plan will be
in full force in all the departments of
the University. It is the plan of the
organizers of the Honor Plan not only
to extend the workings to the studies
and academic side of the University,
but to all the other activities in ad
dition until the whole institution here
is governed on the plan of honor be
tween each other for the whole Uni
versity.
