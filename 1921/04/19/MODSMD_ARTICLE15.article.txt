# Second Annual Labor Day Will Be Held Latter Part of Month
## 
### 
"Labor Day," an institution started
last year for the purpose of cleaning
up the grounds about the old Stanford
residence, now the Children's Conva
lescent Home, will be held the latter
part of the month. On this day, to
be announced soon, afternoon classes
will be suspended, and the student
body will put the grounds in condition.
The men will do the manual work,
with tools furnished by Comptroller
Roth, while the women will prepare
and serve refreshments. It is the in
tention to make the day one of service,
in which students of Stanford will
leave their studies and devote their
efTorts to philanthrophy.
For the most part the students have
done nothing to aid this institution.
The purpose of the Children's Home is
to aid the children of the Lane Clinic
Hospital of San Francisco. The chil
dren are brought to the home after
they are discharged from the Lane
Clinic when it is found that their home
conditions are detrimental to recovery
after leaving the hospital. Tho or
ganization is carried on by Stanford
graduates and persons directly inter
ested. The work to be done would
cost several hundred dollars if out
side labor was employed.
The whole institution is part of a
plan to make the old Stanford resi
dence a memorial to tho Stanford

family. It was Mrs. Stanford's wish
that the residence be devoted to some
such purpose. The Stanford residence
proper was destroyed by fire, but the
present building the old servants'
quarters, is usually spoken of as the
residence, as Mrs. Stanford lived there
for some years after the fire. This
building is now able to accommodate
thirty deserving kiddies, and it is to
benefit them that the clay has been
planned.
Trees about the grounds have been
planted by well-known persons, not
ably President Hayes. Two or three
others were taken by Mrs. Stanford
from seeds of trees planted by Marie
Antoinette in the Royal Gardens of
France. Another part contains the
swing used by Leland Stanford Junior,
and also the mystic maze in which he
played.
The committee to have charge of the
work is: C. J. Tauzer, '2f>, chairman;
J. M. Smith, '21, music director; Hugh
Griswold, 20, Anne Judge, '21, food;
A. B. McAlpin, gang boss; Guy Draper,
'18, Ed Butler, '23, drayage; Fred
Adams, '21. tools; Art Harzfeld, '20,
Robert Armstrong, '21, Ruth Davis,
'20, program; Mary Sprott, '20, super
intendent of women's work.
The above named committee will
meet at 1 o'clock tomorrow in the
Executive Committee room of the Ad

"Labor Day," an institution started
last year for the purpose of cleaning
up the grounds about the old Stanford
residence, now the Children's Conva
lescent Home, will be held the latter
part of the month. On this day, to
be announced soon, afternoon classes
will be suspended, and the student
body will put the grounds in condition.
The men will do the manual work,
with tools furnished by Comptroller
Roth, while the women will prepare
and serve refreshments. It is the in
tention to make the day one of service,
in which students of Stanford will
leave their studies and devote their
efTorts to philanthrophy.
For the most part the students have
done nothing to aid this institution.
The purpose of the Children's Home is
to aid the children of the Lane Clinic
Hospital of San Francisco. The chil
dren are brought to the home after
they are discharged from the Lane
Clinic when it is found that their home
conditions are detrimental to recovery
after leaving the hospital. Tho or
ganization is carried on by Stanford
graduates and persons directly inter
ested. The work to be done would
cost several hundred dollars if out
side labor was employed.
The whole institution is part of a
plan to make the old Stanford resi
dence a memorial to tho Stanford

family. It was Mrs. Stanford's wish
that the residence be devoted to some
such purpose. The Stanford residence
proper was destroyed by fire, but the
present building the old servants'
quarters, is usually spoken of as the
residence, as Mrs. Stanford lived there
for some years after the fire. This
building is now able to accommodate
thirty deserving kiddies, and it is to
benefit them that the clay has been
planned.
Trees about the grounds have been
planted by well-known persons, not
ably President Hayes. Two or three
others were taken by Mrs. Stanford
from seeds of trees planted by Marie
Antoinette in the Royal Gardens of
France. Another part contains the
swing used by Leland Stanford Junior,
and also the mystic maze in which he
played.
The committee to have charge of the
