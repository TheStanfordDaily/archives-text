# THE 						BASEBALL FIGHT
## 
### 
Another Stanford tradition may take the path of oblivion with the
cancellation by the Men's Council of the baseball fight of yesterday aft
ernoon. We hear the familiar student objections that we are losing
every red-blooded tradition that Stanford ever had, and on the .part
of others there is satisfaction that students by their own action were able
to stop a performance that had already been carried to extremes and
promised to bring further discredit to the contestants and to their Uni
versity.
It seems hardly creditable that Stanford men of today cannot con
duct their customary class fights without allowing them to degenerate
with men who lose their heads so far as to injure persons and property of
their rivals as well as that of neutral owners. No doubt the entire affair
has been immensely exaggeratedâ€”men have been reported seriously ill
who were already dismissed from the hospital. But there is also no
doubt that the battle went altogether too far, and all because there were
in the group of classmen a few who had so little above the ears that they
insisted on taking action bound to result in the type of affair that devel
oped. The plug ugly long ago made its last bow and was ushered from
the scene because there were aftiong the combatants a similar few who
were unable to draw upon their reasoning jxnvers.
Student body authorities in stopping the preliminaries early Tues
day morning took the only possible course. In declaring the battle of
yesterday afternoon canceled we believe they again acted in the only
manner reasonable in view of the turn' events had taken and the keen
feeling that had been aroused among the contestants and the University
as a whole.
But we regret, to see the baseball light abolished. Of all the un
derclass contests it is probably the most scientific, requiring the best
qualities of leadership, organization, well-defined plans, and strategy,
for proper execution. It is favorable to smaller numbers as well as
large, and affords ample opportunity for headwork and tactics in getting
the ball from the game and returning it to the varsity captain. The,
contest should be good jn developing class and university spirit and con
sciousness which makes for a live student body.
Yet as matters stand, the fight this year has been abolished possibly
not to be taken up again. We believe that with the lesson that has been
learned the contest could be conducted with certain provisions and super
vision of "S" men and student officials that would guarantee that the
fight be not a physical battle, but the contest of wits qnd strategy that it
really is. Could the contest be so conducted the victory for student su
pervision would indeed be worth while, with the fight and its beneficial
elements retained while the absurdities of camps and preliminary battles
in the hills could be elimintaed. If the student officials could accomplish
this, we believe they would effect a very worthy solution.
