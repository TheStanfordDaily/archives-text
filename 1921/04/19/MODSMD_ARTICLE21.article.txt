# PROFESSOR ELMORE IS TEACHER AND SCHOLAR
## 
### 
With the belief that research is
indispensible to good teaching fore
most in his mind, Jefferson Elmore,
Associate Professor of Latin has com
bined the life of a scholar and teacher
since taking up his duties as an in
structor in Stanford in 1898. Professor
Elmore believes that true knowledge
for both teacher and studeut is at
tained only when the material is so
absorbod that it becomes Really his
own, and that this may be accomplish
ed only by thorough study and re
search.
Though born in Missouri, Professor
Elmore counts himself a Californiau,
his family having moved to this state
in 1881. He graduated in 1883 from
Laurel Hall School in San Mateo, a
private school which was well known
at that time. He became a teacher
in the institution and served as vice
president for several years.
In 1893 Professor Elmore came to
Stanford and after two years' work
received both the A. 8., and A. M. de
grees, being thus doubly a pioneer as
the class of '95 was the first to gradu
ate from the University. His first
work after leaving college was the
organization of the Merced County
High School, one of the first schools
of its kind in the state. He returned
to Stanford to become an instructor in
the Latin department and continued
his studies for a Ph.D. degree, which
he received in 1900.
The following fifteen months were
.spent in travel and study abroad,
chiefly in Italy and Germany, where
he studies at the Universities of Bonn
and Berlin. During his travels through
Italy Professor Elmore made a care
ful study of the remains of the old
Roman civilization, which he believes
to have exerted an important influ
ence on present-day conditions. On
his return to this country and to Stan

ford he was made Assistant Professor
of Latin and Associate Professor in
1910. In 1910-11 he was acting head
of the department, a position which
he has also filled during the greater
part of Professor Fairclough's recent
two years' travel.
In 1915 he was president of the
Pacific Coast Philological Association
having his presidential address on
"Tacitus and Some Roman Ideals" pub
lished by the University of California
in its University Chronicle. He is
also the author of a volume on "The
Syntax of Certain Latin Verbs of
Desire" and a "Book of Latin Prose
Composition." Some of his most im
portant and best-known work has been
done in articles on philological and
historical subjects which have appear
ed in all the leading classical journals
in the United States and in England.
Essentially a scholar, Professor El
more has emphasized, in his instruc
tion in Latin, the impoctance of know
ing the Latin language and literature
for the great part they have played
in making the world what it is, as well
as for their own intrinsic value and
excellence. In addition to Latin, Pro
fessor Elmore has charge of the work
in Roman history and civilization and
like the Latin he believes that these
subjects are important for the light
they throw upon our modern world.
Professor Elmore's favorite diver
sions are two which are not usually
grouped together, namely, the moun
tains and public affairs. He is a mem
ber of the Stanford Camp at FaHen
Leaf, and with other nature devotees
of the University community spends a
part of almost every summer there.
He is intensely interested in all pub
lic and his highest esteem
centers on Woodrow Wilson whom he
has ardently supported as president
of the Wilson Club in Palo Alto, from
the time of its organization.

ing the Latin language and literature
for the great part they have played
in making the world what it is, as well
as for their own intrinsic value and
excellence. In addition to Latin, Pro
fessor Elmore has charge of the work
in Roman history and civilization and
like the Latin he believes that these
subjects are important for the light
they throw upon our modern world.
Professor Elmore's favorite diver
sions are two which are not usually
grouped together, namely, the moun
tains and public affairs. He is a mem
ber of the Stanford Camp at FaHen
Leaf, and with other nature devotees
of the University community spends a
part of almost every summer there.
He is intensely interested in all pub
lic and his highest esteem
centers on Woodrow Wilson whom he
has ardently supported as president
of the Wilson Club in Palo Alto, from
the time of its organization.
With the belief that research is
indispensible to good teaching fore
most in his mind, Jefferson Elmore,
Associate Professor of Latin has com
bined the life of a scholar and teacher
since taking up his duties as an in
structor in Stanford in 1898. Professor
Elmore believes that true knowledge
for both teacher and studeut is at
tained only when the material is so
absorbod that it becomes Really his
own, and that this may be accomplish
ed only by thorough study and re
search.
Though born in Missouri, Professor
Elmore counts himself a Californiau,
his family having moved to this state
in 1881. He graduated in 1883 from
Laurel Hall School in San Mateo, a
private school which was well known
at that time. He became a teacher
in the institution and served as vice
president for several years.
In 1893 Professor Elmore came to
Stanford and after two years' work
received both the A. 8., and A. M. de
grees, being thus doubly a pioneer as
the class of '95 was the first to gradu
ate from the University. His first
work after leaving college was the
organization of the Merced County
High School, one of the first schools
of its kind in the state. He returned
to Stanford to become an instructor in
the Latin department and continued
his studies for a Ph.D. degree, which
he received in 1900.
The following fifteen months were
.spent in travel and study abroad,
chiefly in Italy and Germany, where
he studies at the Universities of Bonn
and Berlin. During his travels through
Italy Professor Elmore made a care
ful study of the remains of the old
Roman civilization, which he believes
to have exerted an important influ
ence on present-day conditions. On
his return to this country and to Stan

ford he was made Assistant Professor
of Latin and Associate Professor in
1910. In 1910-11 he was acting head
of the department, a position which
he has also filled during the greater
part of Professor Fairclough's recent
two years' travel.
In 1915 he was president of the
Pacific Coast Philological Association
having his presidential address on
"Tacitus and Some Roman Ideals" pub
lished by the University of California
in its University Chronicle. He is
also the author of a volume on "The
Syntax of Certain Latin Verbs of
Desire" and a "Book of Latin Prose
Composition." Some of his most im
portant and best-known work has been
done in articles on philological and
historical subjects which have appear
ed in all the leading classical journals
in the United States and in England.
Essentially a scholar, Professor El
more has emphasized, in his instruc
tion in Latin, the impoctance of know
ing the Latin language and literature
for the great part they have played
in making the world what it is, as well
as for their own intrinsic value and
excellence. In addition to Latin, Pro
