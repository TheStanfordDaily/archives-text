# CARDINAL GYMNASTS WILL COMPETE WITH BRUINS ON APRIL 23
## 
### 
Teams representing Stanford and
California will contest for gymnastic
honors in Harmon Gymnasium on
April 23. This will be the first meet
of its kind ever staged by the two
universities, and promises to be a high
class exhibition judging from the
brand of work displayed on previous
occasions by each squad.
Aerial stunts will be performed on
the parallel bars and horizontal bars,
and the rings. Tumbling on the mats,
however, being the main event of the
evening, will gain the greatest inter
est of the contest. The rules of the
meet require one obligatory and two
optional performances in each part
of the program. Individual medals
will be awarded to the winner of the
various events. ' Also, as a result of
the entire contest, either Stanford or
California will receive a championship
cup bearing with it the Cardinal-Bear
gymnastic title.
The Berkeleyans have had a gym
club for several years, while the Stan
ford gym men organized last year.
However, the Cardinal experts have
been working hard every night to get
in shape for the meet. A six-man
team will be chosen from the follow
ing: C. D. Hudson, A. C. White, Rake
straw, Franklin, Glenn, D. Greenwood,
C. B. White, P. C. Wilbur, S. Stresh
ley, B. Levin, R. Rogers. Of these
men, two will be selected by Coach
Botsford for a circle "S."
