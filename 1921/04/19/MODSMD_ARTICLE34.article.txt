# SAUNDERS EXPLAINS NATIONAL MOVEMENT IN LECTURE ON EAST
## 
### 
"The national movements in tlie Far
East," declared Mr. Kenneth J. Saun
ders in his second lecture given at the
Little Theatre yesterday, "mean three
things: a determined resistence to west
ern aggression, an awakening to the
greatness of the heritage of their past
and a revival of the old religions.
"Western literature and learning has
been rejected also in the extravagant
praise of all things oriental. A hundred
years ago before the work of Max
Muller and other western scholars in
unearthing the great heritage of India,
the Indians themselves were entirely
oblivious to their glorious past. Now,
they maintain that all modern knowledge
can be found hidden in the ancient
Vedas.
"Fathers send their children and
wives to church because they think it
will do them good in keeping them sub
missive. Religion is useful also to keep
the working classes under. It is a
mighty lever for suppressing revolution
ary tendencies." â€¢
While sympathising with the national
ist movements in India, China and Ja
pan, Mr. Saunders emphatically asserted
that they were in no way democratic
movements as young Indians in the
don't know what it is all about. You
can't get a democratic movement in
India before there is more understand
ing of the duties of democratic citizen
ship. ' /
"Japan," Mr. Saunders declared, "is
more democratic than any other country
in the sense that the mass of the people
enjoy more fully the riches of life and
yet no country more needs the friend
ship and love of the western natios to
day, than Japan. In helping Japan, wc
must avoid giving moral lectures after
the fashion of the 19th century; and to
talk about the possibility of a war with
Japan is the one fatal thing to do."
