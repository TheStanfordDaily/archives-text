# COACH SEAY'S MEN TO MEET SEMI-PRO TEAM ON SATURDAY
## Cardinal to Continue Stiff Practice to Prepare For Summer Trip to the Orient 
### 
The Cardinal diamond artists will con
tinue sti lT practice throughout the quar
ter in anticipation of the proposed trip
to Japan this summer. They will play
at least one game each week to keep
in condition. The first of these games
will be on the local diamond next Sat
urday against a semi-professional team
of San Francisco. No team has been
decided upon to date but Coacli Seay
intends to pit his men against aggrega
tions which are of fast caliber in order
to benefit as much as possible from the
practice.
Draper, Green, or Kelly will take the
mound in Saturday's game with Green
or Bundy at the receiving end. The
rest of the line-up will remain the same
as in the last game with California.
Pattersons's work around the initial
sack on the inner lot has been con
sistent. with few brodies chalked up
against him. Pie will work in this posi
tion next Saturday. Heckendorf, at the
opposite corner of the lot, is handling
himself in a manner to assure him the
berth for the near future. Mitchell in
the keystone position and Kallam at
short have been delivering a good brand
of ball and will continue the old fight
from the same angles.
Kline, in the outer gardens, has been
the nemesis of several attempted slug
ging contests, and from all appearance?
is likely to he on deck to put over the
same good work. Throughout the sea
son he has been the star outfielder.
The other fly-nabbing positions will be
taken by Carver, Crowe, and Green.
Speaking of all-around ball players.
Green has certainly earned the title. His
old place is behind,the log, but this year
he has delivered good work from the
mound and as an outfielder. In last
Saturday's game he netted an even half
of the total Cardinal hits and it was
no trick play of good luck either, for
he has been slamming them out every
game with consistency.
