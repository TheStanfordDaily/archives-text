# STANFORD TEAM 10 PLAY IN OJAI TENNIS TOURNEY
## Neer and Davies Leave for South to Defend Titles Won in Last Year's Play 
### 
Stanford will be represented in the
annual Ojai Valley tennis tournament
again this year, Captain Phil Neer and
Jim Davies leaving last night to take
part in the meet which opens this aft
ernoon. The tournament is divided
into four sections and will decide not
only the state inter-collegiate singles
and doubles championship, but also
the California open singles and doubles
title. The Stanford men plan upon
entering every event this year.
Last year, the same players repre
sented the Cardinal at the tourna
ment, winning three of the four cham
pionships decided. In the tournament
last year, however, only one Stan
ford man was entered in each tourna
ment. Other universities having rep
resentatives entered in the meet are
Pomona, Redlands, the University of
Southern California, and the Univer
sity of California. California with
Bates and Levy playing their best
game will probably put up the best
competition against the Stanford
players, although Rawlings of Pomona
is looked upon as a comer.
In the open singles championship,
Captain Phil Neer will defeat his title
against the best in the state, while
Jim Davies, winner of the intercollegi
ate championship for 1920, will be
pitted against a large field. Neer and
Davies will be entered in both the
open and intercollegiate doubles play
for the title.
