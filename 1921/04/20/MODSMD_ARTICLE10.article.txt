# MISSIONARY FROM ORIENT TO SPEAR AT INN TOMORROW
## 
### 
Alexander Paul of Wuhu, China, will
speak at a noon luncheon at the Uni
versity Inn tomorrow. Everyone is cor
dially invited to attend the meeting.
for the Lockwood Fund will
be particularly interested.
Mr. Paul is just passing through on
a tour of the West coast and has con
sented to stop off for this one day. He
will tell of the immense opportunities
for helping China's millions build a new
and more democratic civilization, with
particular emphasis on the commanding
role now being played by the students of
that country, among whom our Stanford
representative, E. H. Lockwood, is
working.
When the irrigation dykes broke some
years ago, flooding a large territory and
destroying the crops, and no honest gov
ernment official could he found to re
pair the damage, Mr. Paul was given
some $50,000 and 7,000 men to do the
job. Since that time the devastated dis
trict has been in a most prosperous- con
dition, with bumper crops resulting. As
a token of their regard, the Chinese peo
ple have presented Mr. Paul with sev
eral gold medals, and two monuments
stand in that territory as a tribute to his
feat.
