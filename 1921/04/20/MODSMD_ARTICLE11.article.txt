# JOHN A. SCOTT TALKS ON HOMER IN LITTLE THEATRE
## U. of C. Classics Professor Says That Homer Failed to Reverence Grecian Dieties 
### 
Maintaining the view that the Ho
meric poems are the creation of one
great mind, Professor John Adams
Scott in his lecture in the Little The
atre last evening supported his belief
with the argument of the individualiza
tion of the characters found in Ho
mer's works, and discussed the Ho
mer's delineation of gods and hero«s.
"Homer's godß were poetic crea
tions, not the gods he himself wor
shipped," Professor Scott said.
"Homer was not trying to arouse a
feeling of reverence for the Greek
dieties. An ignoble conception of the
gods is uniform throughout all Ho
meric poetry." He doeß not try to
conceal the baseness of their nature,
and only occasionally are .his gods
sublime. But Homer was the first ta
make of them machinery for poetry.
He drew them with the hand of a poet,
and it is these portraits which have
prevailed. The uniformity of concep
tion found in these representations
Professor Scott holds as an indication
of one original author.
In speaking of Homer's heroes, Pro
fessor Scott stated that no other
author has ever drawn so completely
and with such variety so many char
acters which have passed into the li
terature of the world. The Greek poet
makes no effort, he said, to withhold
great ideas of great characters. He
had no need for thrift in this con
nection; his powers were jnexaliust
ible.
Professor Scott illustrated Homer's
powers of character creation in a de
tailed discussion of the two famous
characters of the Iliad and Odyssey.
Helen and Odysseus. "There is hard
ly a more vivid and well-defined pic
ture in our whole literature than Helen
of Troy," he said. "The world's
Helen is Homer's. Every line blends
in making a perfect picture." Of
Odysseus he pointed out that it is the
hero'se nobility as much as his shrewd
ness that exalts him. This same unity
is consistent throughout all the other
Homeric characters.
The lack of uniformity found in the
character portrayal in Greek plays
in which the same persons are found,
the different views found in the four
gospels and the fact that it was im
possible for a second writer to con
tinue the story yof Don Quixote are
proofs that two people cannot see nor
conceive characters from the same
point of view, Professor Scott believes.
This and the fact that no incidents
are duplicated in the Illiad and Odys
sey, he said, are a further indication
that unity of character and action in
Homeric poetry are due to one man,
and that each creation sprang from a
single brain.
