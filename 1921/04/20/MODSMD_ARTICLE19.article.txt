# RED CROSS ASKS IMMEDIATE HELP FOR EUROPEANS
## Clothing is Urgently Needed to Help European Children —Service Board Working 
### 
Due to the arute suffering of the
children of Europe from the lack of
proper clothing, the Red Cross work
ers of the Pacific Division Lave Bent
out calls to all its chapters for help.
Under the direction of the president
of the Service Board, Roberta Hawk
hurst, '23, a Red Cross room will be
started at once on the campus. In
formation collected on the matter
shows that there is instant need of
250,000 layettes and 2,000,000* garm
ents for children up to the age of four
teen and a large number of garments
can be used before these children can
be even decently clothed. This call
is to the women of America, and the
Stanford women as a part of that
mass have been asked to help. So
every woman in the 500 is aßkedjlto
answer thi» call, and. come to the front
with her knitting needles and thimbles
and be ready to make clothes for the
children of the European countries.
President Wilbur today made the
following appeal to the Stanford
group:
"To the men and women of Stan
ford":
"Again there comes one of those
calls to all Stanford men and women
which we have ever been ready to
meet. A lot of little children and
babies 'over there' need clothes —not
the latest styleß but just plain gar
ments to keep out the cold and the
rain. We have been helping Hoover
give them enough food to keep them
alive and growing a little —and now
the American Red Cross asks us to
help him to put something on their
backs. They want a quarter of a mil
lion sets of clothes for new bab?ea and
2,000,000 outfits for children up to 14
years of age. It will seem like old
times to our women to sew and knit
for others and the men can at least
help somewhat on providing clcth and
holding yarn. Made overs and recon
structed garments will be acceptable.
"I appeal to all of those Stanford
groups whose response has been so
immediate and so effective in the past
to join in on this new opportunity to
do something worth while under the
management of our own Red Cross."
