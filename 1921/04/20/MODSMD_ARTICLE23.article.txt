# 1921 IS ASKED TO SMOKER

Despite that Stanford is a University of limited numbers where any
student in the course of four years may learn to know at least by sight
and name a large proportion of all who make up the campus community,
many graduate every year knowing very little of the men who make up
perhaps the most important element of Stanford, the faculty. Failure
of students to take advantage of this opportunity of the Stanford edu
cational system is sometimes attributed with more or less justification to
inability to learn to know busy professors who seem to have little incli
nation for personal touch with them. But most men who leave the cam
pus with only the classroom idea of the personality and character of in
structors do so because they have made no effort to get any other opinion.
In the invitation to the smoker at the Faculty Clubhouse Friday
seniors who still have the lecture-platform conception of their instruc
tors have an opportunity to learn that they measure quite differently from
that standard alone.
Of course, the faculty are not extending the invitation in the light of
that "opportunity." They are planning a slick program of baseball
game, barbecue supper, and stunts in which all live men of both the 1921
class and the faculty may take part and enjoy.
