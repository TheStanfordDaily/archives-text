# A 						CONTEST OF WITS
## 
### 
In definitely canceling the freshman-sophomore baseball fight for
this year the Men's Council took the only action that would meet the sit
uation yesterday with all the contingencies that unfortunately developed.
In definitely refraining from any action that would take away the con
test for the future the statement of the council should again meet with
approval. * I*
No one advocates the type of affair that came out of the contest this
year. Most undesirable results came largely from the "lost heads" on the
part of a few combatants. If the contest is conducted next year the ab
surdities of this year's fight must be wholly eliminated.
It has been suggested that no definite time be set for the contest in
advance, except that it be conducted within a given period of seven or
eight days. At noon time of any day the varsity baseball captain may
announce the underclass game for that afternoon at 4p. m. This would
require on the part of each class, not a military or mob organization in
the hills, but an organization that could on short notice get the informa
tion to all sophomores or freshmen to be at the baseball field at the
appointed time. The necessity and usefullness of pre-game camps would
be eliminated.
A definite announcement of the committees in charge of the contest
from each class could be published. The committees could go before
the men's council, receive definite instruction as to rules of the contest,
and be held responsible for their violation. It is committee action that
causes establsihment of camps and without it they probably would not
exist.
In 1919 the underclass contest was conducted without damage or
any of the undesirable preliminary battles because the sophomore com
mittee laid emphasis, not on pre-game skirmishes, but on a method of
getting the marked ball from the game and a way of returning it to the
captain. The fight must be made what it really is, a contest of wits for
taking jx>ssession of tlve ball and returning it, and not a physical battle
to carry away contestants before the game. The whole event then would
take the time of the classmen from 4 o'clock one afternoon until 8 o'clock
that evening, with practically the hours from 5 until 7 free, as nothing
can usually be done during that time. The unusual demand on the stu
dent study hours would then be done away with.
There is no reason why the baseball contest next year cannot be con
ducted in a way that is productive of all the good of intelligent under
class rivalry without the pre-game physical battles, but student officials
next year will have to make definite and comprehensive provisions for
the governing of the event, and they must make them in such a way as to
guarantee their enforcement.
