# UNIVERSITY WOMEN PLAN RADIUM GIFT FOR MARIE CURIE
## 
### 
In order that all college women may
have a personal share in the gift of
one gram of radium which the univer
sity women of America wish to pre
sent to Aline. Marie Curie, the dis
coverer of radium and one of the best
known women in the scientific world,
the New York Committee for the
fund is sending out appeals to the
alumnae of Stanford and has sent a
communication to Alumni Secretary
McDowell, asking him to make the
plan known to all of the women in
the University.
Mme. Curie will arrive in the United
States from Paris on May 17, and will
be welcomed at Carnegie Hall on May
18, by the University women of this
country. At a later meeting in Wash
ington the university women are plan
ning to present her with one gram of
radium as a tribute to her distinguish
ed work in the scientific field. Mme.
Curie has said that her greatest wish
is for one gram of radium for experi
mental purposes and scientists hope
that working with a single gram she
may be able to entirely eliminate
cancer.
One gram of radium will cost ?100,-
000 since it is not on the market at
the present time it will have to be
produced, hence the immediate need
for subscriptions to the fund.
The New York Committee is desir
ous of having alumnae from every
American university present at the
meeting in May and also delegates
from the ranks of the undergradu
ates, especially those who are inter
ested in scientific work in the lines of
physics and chemistry.
Subscriptions to the fund may be
sent to the Women's University Club,
106 East 52d Street, New York City.
