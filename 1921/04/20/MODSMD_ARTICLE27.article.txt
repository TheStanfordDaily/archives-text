Compilations of statistics released

YESTERDAY 432,234.342 words
were spoken on the campus. These
figures do not include between-class
compilations taken at the Law Steps.
Seventy-seven per cent by Men's
Cancel and representative underclass
men.
Twenty-two percent by certain com
mitteemen.
The remainder is attributed to the
rest of the members of A. S. S. U.

501 Joes made funny cracks at the
Engineering Corner. An equal num
ber, less one, of Mabels heard them.
Three recipients of more deadly cracks
got their names in the papers.
* * *
All but 81 underclassmen cut class
es. Of these only 80 fell asleep. The
remainder were snoring as they walked
into the room.
• * *
Eleven dinks were counted on the
campus, a new intra-collegiate record.
Measures were taken by upperclass
men to prevent the spread of the con
tagion. None # were injured in the
fracas.
« * *
"Damn" was remarked, stated,
spoken and otherwise uttered no less
than 97,711 times. No statistics are
