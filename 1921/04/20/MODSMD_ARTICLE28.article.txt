# HONOR SYSTEM TO HAVE AMENDMENTS PUT IN IT SOON
## 
### 
In the meeting yesterday between
Professor R. L. Green of the special
honor system investigation committee
from the Acadcmic Council and Mari
on Kyle, '18, of the students' com
mittee, Professor Green stated that
two committees would get together at
an early date to decide upon minor
matters in connection with introduc
tion of the plan at the end of the
quarter. It is planned now to put it
into effect at the opening of the next
scholastic year.
A number of changes have to be
made in the present system of ex
aminations when the new system is
put. into force. On the examination
books there will be a notice that the
examination is given under the honor
system and on the registration books
that each student gets at the beginning
of the quarters there will be a page
deVoted to the explanation of the sys
tem as it will be in the University.
This will be primarily for the new stu
dents each time so that they will see
at the outset the way that the classes
are to be conducted.
Before any adoption of the system
is made, the entire plan will be pub
lished for the edification of those who
do not know how it works in its en
tirety. Some changes have been made
already from the form that was ex
plained to the students at the incep
tion of the proposition, and these will
be shown plainly so that no one will
have any doubts as to the agreement
that he is signing in regard to com
liance with the rules.
