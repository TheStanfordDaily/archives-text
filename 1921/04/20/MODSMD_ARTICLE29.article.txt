CALIFORNIA, Los Angeles, April 20.â€”
Declaring that blue and red are not
complimentary colors, students of the
department of art have circulated a peti
tion for the amelioration of the vivid
color scheme of the tie wadministration
building which is now in its final stages
of completion. The structure is finished
on the exterior in brick of varied
shades of red and in tile of sunset hues,
all of which the art students say in their
petition to he aesthetically pleasing.
However, within the last few weeks, the
window frames throughout the building
were painted in a blue said to he a cross
between the new Mrs. Harding blue and
the "Blue Sunday" blue. The art stu
dents claim that the latest addition of
paint causes a clash in the color scheme.
The petition has been successfully cir
culated and is ready to be presented to
the administration.
