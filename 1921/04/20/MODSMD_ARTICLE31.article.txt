# MODEL OF ROME A DESIRED ADDITION FOR LOCAL CAMPUS
## 
### 
On his recent visit to the campus, Pro
fessor Franz Cumont, world scholar and
student of anthropology, brought to the
attention of the Latin department the
value which Stanford could derive
through the acquisition of the Bigot
Model of Imperial Rome, now in the
possession of the French government.
This model is an exact replica of the
old Roman capital in the days of its
greatest power. It was constructed after
a careful study of the history and archi
tecture of that period and may be ac
cepted as an authentic reproduction.
The model was exhibited on the site
of the Baths of Diocletian at the Italian
Exposition in 1911. Professor Fair
dough of the Latin department was in
Italy at the time and brought back very
favorable criticisms concerning it. Later
the model was sold to the French gov
ernment for $20,(XX) and was removed to
Paris. Since the war the financial con
dition of the French republic makes it
unwise for that government to retain
the model. An effort is being made,
therefore, to sell it to some national mu
seum or university. The cost of trans
porting it to America ond the construc
tion of a temporary building to house it
would amount to about $5,000.
It is the opinion of Professor Elmore
that this model would be a very inter
esting and valuable addition to the Stan
ford campus, and he is making every
effort to arouse the itnerest of anyone
who may be in a position to finance the
project. To quote from a letter re
ceived by Professor Elmore in regard to
the matter, "The model would be of a
two-fold valueâ€”first as a work of art,
and secondly as an instrument of edu
cation, both for demonstration of the
principles of monumental composition
and also for the teaching of history."
