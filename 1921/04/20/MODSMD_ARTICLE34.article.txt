# PHYSICAL EDUCATION FACULTY WILL TRAIN COACHES THIS SUMMER
## 
### 
Next quarter the physical education
faculty will not go on a summer vaca
tion as is its custom, but instead will
conduct what will practically turn out
to be a school for preparatory and high
school coaches. It is the plan of those
back of the movement to assemble fifty
coaches and give them a thorough
course in how to handle all of the dif
ferent sports in the elementary schools.
There is a great demand now for
these coaches, as the California legis
lature ha? made physical training com
pulsory in the various high schools
throughout the state. I his makes a
number of good salaried positions open
to college men who have gone through
this school and received the certificate
that is necessary to coach in the state
high schools.
Eastern colleges have been using this
method of training coaches for some
time, and Stanford is the first western
university to follow up this plan.
These universities have found it use
ful to them in picking their athletes and
it is upon these facts that the Stan
ford physicial training department has
started this school.
Dr. Browne has just issued a little
pamplet describing the courses to be
given this summer and all those inter
ested are requested to see him in re
gard to the matter. Dr. Browne
states that any man who is a graduate
of this school is practically assured of
a good position.
