## 
### 
All senior men who have not a var
sity baseball letter are asked to give
their names to either Jack Patrick or
Lindsay Gillis tomorrow or next day,
if they can play ball with the senior
team on Friday afternoon. The seni
our-Faculty baseball game comes off
on the faculty diamond Friday after
noon, at 4 o' clock and it is the wish
of President Patrick to have a large
representation out from the class for
the game. Any none-varsity man is
eligible to play on the team. This ap
plies to those who are graduating with
the class this year whether they have
been officially affiliated with the class
of *21, or not.
President Patrick has issued the fol
lowing call to the members of the
senior class relative to the faculty
senior smoker that will be held Fri
day night. "Every man in tthe class
that can pos3ibly make it ought to
be at the smoker Friday night. This
event is th greatest showing of the
faculty men in their attempt to get on
a more congenial footing with the stu
dents of the University and all the
men in the class should feel it their
duty and privilege to come to the
smoker in return for the courtesy ex
tended."
The Faculty team is an unknown
quantity to most of the University in
this line of sport. In practice games
this season they have not made too
fcood a showing, but they are practi
cing and have on the line-up some of
the stellar faculty athletes of the col
lege. The game promises to be inter
esting from the standpoint of every
one concerned.
