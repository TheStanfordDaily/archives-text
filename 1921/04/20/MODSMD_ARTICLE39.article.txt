# COACH SEAY'S TEAM TO MEET EDMONSON
## Fast Semi-Pro Team to Invade Campus Saturday; Draper to Take Mound for 'Cards' 
### 
Coach Seay's men will cross bats
Saturday afternoon on the local dia
mond with the Edmondson Baseball
Club of Crockett, one of the fastest
semi-professional teams in this part
of the state. Crockett has always
maintained a reputation for fast teams
and the Edmondson' aggregation is
reported to be up to the old standard.
Draper will take the slab for the
Cardinal with Nef and Kelly in re
serve. Draper has all the earmarks
of a nifty twirler and has delivered
some good work this season, although
the misfortune of an infected hand
kept him out of uniform for several
weeks and took the edge off his con
dition. The slugging of the Blue and
Gold combination last Saturday car
ries no significance as the big fellow
was simply a little off color, and the
day was more suited for ducks than
baseball anyhow.
Nef and Kelly have a fair record
behind them with every indication of
better work during the next month.
Coach Seay expects to put emphasis
on the work of the slabsters during
the rest of the season to round them
out for the Oriental trip.
Green or Bundy will do the receiv
ing with the other pulling down the
flies which enter the field territory.
The rest of the line-up will play as be
fore with Patterson at first, Mitchell
and Kallam at either side of the key
atone, and Heckendorf at third. Kline
Carver and Crowe will take care of
the outer regions.
The game is scheduled for 3 p.m.,
and Vellou of San Francisco will make |
the decisions.
