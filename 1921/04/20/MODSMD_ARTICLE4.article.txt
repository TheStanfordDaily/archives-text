# OPERA REHEARSALS PROGRESSING FAST
## 
### 
Rehearsals for the Junior Opera are
making speedy headway. The cast is
already beginning to put finishing
touches on the prologue and first act.
They have thrown themselves into tho
spirit of the rehearsals with an en
thusiasm that is most gratifying to
the coach The choruses are doing
their share of progressing, too, and
havo worked out the steps to quite a
few of the musical numbers already.
The men's chorus has not yet begun
their work on their numbers, but will
start this evening. They are to havo
some solo numbers, which is quite a
novelty in the way of men's choruses.
