OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, Corvallis, April 20.â€”Reveille is
being sounded early for some students
at O. A. C. who are attending special
classes at 7:10 in the morning, and the
old song, "Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in
the Morning," is coming back into its
own. Many classes are overcrowded this
quarter, and in order to give the stu
dents the advantage of enrolling in
smaller many are placed at this
early hour.
