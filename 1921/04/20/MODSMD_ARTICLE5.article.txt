# Groans of Grief For Greek Goddess Descend on Davis
## 
### 
Walk in—lmpossible—and sit down.
Sorry we haven't the latest Police
Gazette to offer you but like a dress
shirt front, you have a habit of bobb
ing up at the most unexpected times.
I understand that you had an encount
er with the property man at the As
sembly Hall the other day regarding
the thing that women strive for, men
thrive for but babies never cry for —
beauty. Am I not right?
Yes, as the signpost remarked, it's
this way. When Ted Shawn Bent
down the list of things needed for the
Denisliawn entertainment Thursday
night, here's how it looked:
Saphho Scene:
I willow tree
1 Stone bench
1 Greek goddess.
When Pat Wells saw that last item
he passed out, and as he came to, he
informed the public at large that Stan
ford was a university and not a beauty
emporium. The idea, that one could
walk out and casually pick a beauty
was like the idea that one can got
an edible steak at the Union. It
can't be did.
Then a bright thought struck him
(a mere love tap, however.) He went
to the campus connoisseur of beauty,
Gordon Arthur Davis, faculty dramatic
coach and hero of divers esthetic ad
ventures.
Davis had been among those pres
ent at the recent Castilian Carnival
presided over by the Irish King.
Though the king delivered an awful
punch Davis remembered the queen
as more than passing fair and decided
that if possible she should be the
Greek goddess.
Miss Lies kindly consented to pose
as the goddess in Sappho's garden.
She stands motionless while the dance
goes on about her,and she makes a
bewitching figure in her beautiful
Grecian robes. We'll say that Davis
made a happy choice when he thought
of her.
