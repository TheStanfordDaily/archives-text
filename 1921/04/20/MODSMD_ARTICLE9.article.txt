# STUDENT BODY ELECTION IS PUT OVER TO MONDAY
## Amendment Changing Rules In Regard to Money Paid to W. A. A. is On the Ballot 
### 
A short meeting was held by the exec
utive committee last night and it was
decided to postpone the Student Body
election from this Friday until next Mon
day. There will be three amendments to
the constitution voted on which will be
run in the Daily Palo Alto, according to
rule, five consecutive times before voted
on. One of these is that Section 2 of
Articte 111 in the Constitution be
stricken out. It reads: "The Studeift
Manager shall require an estimate of
expenses from the Women's Athletic
Association and the Women's Confer
ence at the beginning of each quarter,
and shall be prepared to expend for their
purposes, if required, at least 75 per
cent of the receipts from association dues
collected from all expenditures of these
organizations and shall cooperate with
the Women's Athletic Hoard in such
wSys as the latter may desire."
This provides that the Student Body
Manager pay the bills of the above
named women's organizations, but this is
void now as the Student Body Manager
does not receive any funds for that pur
pose as they are given direct to the W.
A. A. This money, taken from the
women's registration fee, is handled en
tirely by the W. A. A.
The minutes of the meeting are as fol
lows :
M.S.C. That the Student Body elec
tion be postponed from April 22 until
Wednesday, April 27.
M.S.C. That the Student Manager be
instructed to purchase the sweaters
