# RUTH SI. DENIS AND TED SHAWN APPEAR TONIGHT
## World-Famous Dancers Have Prepared Good Program Which Begins at 8 O'clock 
### 
Tonight at 8:00 o'clock in the Assem
bly Hall the curtain goes up on one of
the world's most famous dancers, Ruth
St. Denis. She has given the world
something new in dancing and has been
to a great extent her own teacher. This
is easy to understand, as Miss St. Denis
has a vivid, fertile imagination, in which
is created the seed out of which her
famed interpretive dances grow. These
dances cover mostly the mood and mys
tery of the Orientâ€”Japanese, Egyptian,
Siamese and Persian predominating.
They have been danced before kings and
high officers of state, but none will have
seen the rich and splendid program in its
entirety that Stanford will witness to
night.
Ted Shawn, husband and dancing
partner of Ruth St. Denis, has also
earned his laurels in the dancing world,
holding the first place among the male
dancers in America. He is also well
placed among European dancers and has
received recognition from the best of
European critics. Shawn's technic is
almost perfect, though he has not the
versatility of Miss St. Denis; still his
dancing holds all that virility typical of
the American man of today. He will
give several solo dances, the most 'fa
mous of which are probably his "Jap
anese Spear Dance" and his "Invocation
to the Thunderbird." The latter is the
more striking of the two, representing
the Indian medicine man in a ceremonial
dance for rain.
Miss Ann Thompson, concert pianist, I
will also hold an important place on the
program and will offer several piano
solos. Miss Thompson is an accom
plished and experienced pianist and has
been with Ruth St. Denis for some time,
always being enthusiastically received on
every appearance.
Four of the Denishawn dancers will
accompany the artists in their appear
ance. These are four of the best, being
Lenore Scheffer, Lenore Hellekson,
Betty Rohrer and Pearl Wheeler. All
these girls studied at the famous Deni
shawn school of dancing in Los Angeles
where Ted Shawn has charge of the
dancing instruction. This school has
turned out some of the best known
dancers on the stage today, and these are
four of those who have had the oppor
tunity to stay with Ruth St. Denis and
Ted Shawn.
Altogether the program is a delightful
and well rounded one. The remaining
tickets will be sold at the box office to
night before the performance. They are
selling at $2.00, $1.50 and $1.00.
