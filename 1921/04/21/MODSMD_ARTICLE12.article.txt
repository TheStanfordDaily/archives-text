# CARDS. CALIFORNIA DRAW UP TEN-YEAR MAJOR SPORTS PACT
## Martin Signs Agreement Based on Plan for New Stadiums by Two Rival Universities 
### 
California and Stanford will meet
in all forms of major sports for the
next ten years, according to an agree
ment in the form of a contract drawn
up at a conference meeting of repre
sentatives from the two universities,
held at the University Club of San
Francisco, yesterday afternoon.
The agreement is based on the plans
of the stadiums to be built at both
universities ,and is an assurance that
subscribers to the funds will be
guaranteed of receiving the seat pri
vileges which accompany all subscrip
tions over $100. All disagreements
between the two colleges which have
come up in the past will be prevented
by the contract, at least for the period
'.u which it wil? i'e in effect.
A further agreement was made by
the representatives that the seating
capacity of the representative stadi
ums would be at least 60,000. The
California delegates intimated that
their structure would accommodate
even a larger number. According to
the present plans of construction it is
likely that the Stanford stadium will
be completed first but it was decided
that not more than two of the big foot
ball games will be played on one cam
pus in succession.
Neither stadium will be ready for
the big game next fall, which will be
played on the Stanford football field.
California agreed, however, to aid on
a fifty-fifty basis in erecting addition
al bleachers to accommodate 70,000
people for this game. All eligibility
rules for contests will remain the same
and with the new ten-year contract
with California, all squabbles between
the two universities are removed for
that time at least.
The representatives at yesterday's
conference included R. Barrett, Thomas
Williams, Percy Witchell, and Ed
Martin of Stanford, and James Cline,
Luther Nichols, and Dean Putnam of
California.
