speedy Cardinal quarter miler wan
elected yesterday when Coach "Dink"
Templeton called a meeting of the

was the "dark horse" of the big meet

the same way after he had started
several yards behind the I. C. A. A. A.
A. champion.
Yesterday was picture day for the
Card track team. The entire varsity
squad was snapped and the photog
rapher made it a good day's work by
taking point-winner, group and indi
vidual pictures. Captain Morris Kirk
sey and Captain-elect Wright came in
for most of the "shots." Practically
all of the individual photographs will
be sent East to precede the men who
will compete in the national inter
collegiates at Harvard, May 27 and
28 th.

Unless the date for the Pacific Coast
Conference meet is .set forward a
week it is probable that Stanford will
not enter a team in the coast classic.
Prospects seem bright, however, for a
six man team to enter the I. C. A. A
A. A. next month. Captain Kirhsey,
Jess Wells, Art Wilcox, Kenny Wright,

probably compose the Cardinal entries.
