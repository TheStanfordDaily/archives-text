# NEW COURTS READY FOR PRACTICE SOON
## 
### 
Stanford's two new varsity tennis
courts aro fast ( nearing completion
and should be ready for use in a short
time. The courts, when completed,
will be two of the best on the Pacific.
Coast, and will have a special drain
age system which will allow matches
to be played upon them directly after
a rain. The asphalt on the courts has
already been laid and only the finish
ing touches remain to be made by the
contractor.
The present varsity courts will be
fiwn up to make room for the basket
ball pavilion upon which contruction
is to start soon and 10 new courts
are being built near the Encina eat
ing clubs to take the place of these.
These courts will be used for intra
mural and class tennis and are the
first group of 60 courts planned to be
built in the next six years at Stan
ford, by Dr. Browne. Grading work
on the courts has already started and
the grounds will be in shape in a. short
time for the laying of the asphalt.
This move for a larger number of
athletic fields is a big step in advance
for Stanford and follows the move of
several of the largest eastern universi
ties. At the present, the majority of
the eastern institutions have extensive
areas devoted to tennis, Princeton
boasting of 120* courts alone.
