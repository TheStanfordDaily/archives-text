# STUDENTS AS HOSTS
## 
### 
In former years Stanford held a "visiting' day" for graduates at
the close of the regular academic year when the track and field were dead
and (lie law steps and the engineering corner conveyed to visitors only
die "deserted village" conception of the current university life.
On May M members of the faculty and student body will be hosts
to a great number of graduates. A full program will be planned to en
tertain the visitors and give them an estimate of the proportions of the
University of today and the character of its active members. Students
have a part and purpose in the day, to demonstrate to the alumni Stan
ford as it is, to explain to visitors changes or new measures they may
not understand about the plant, and to enthuse them wjth the conviction
that Stanford is going straight ahead as they themselves would have it.
A. student committee will plan undergraduate participation in events
of the day. But the essential element in the undertaking is a universal
willingness and readiness among all students to take part with the spirit
of the occasion and make every visitor who returns feel that he has
come back to very much the same progressive, living, and moving farm
that he may have left one or twenty-five years ago.

MANY STUDENTS COMPLAIN that the habit of smoking up to the
very moment of entering the library and of "tiring..up" by persons im
mediately on emerging therefrom result in a vestibule, steps, and pave
ment of cigarette stubs and burned matches of undignified and untidy
appearance. It has been suggested that this small area of stone and
concrete might be considered a portion of the Quad where smoking is
"taboo." Or the stubs and matches thrown away might be distributed
at points other than the stone and concrete at the entrance.

MEM IJERS OF THE 1 ( )21 CLASS have been invited to the faculty,
to an excellent barbecue and smoker at the Faculty Clubhouse from
4:00 p.m. until 7:00 p.m. tomorrow afternoon. It should be' quite
worthwhile, too, to see the faculty ball team, as announced, in action.
