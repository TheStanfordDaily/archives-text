# STUDENT CONTROL OWES MUCH TO M. R. KIRK WOOD
## 
### 
To the efforts of Professor Marion
Rice Kirkwood of the Law department
is largely due the establishment and
operation of student self-government
at Stanford. In both his undergradu
ate days at the University, when he
took an active part in preparing the
way for its introduction, and more
recently as chairman of the commit
tee on Student Affairs, the name of
Professor Kirkwood has been closely
connected with matters of student
control.
The story of his life is one of rapid
advancement in his chosen profession,
and that of a Stanford man returning
a few years after his graduation to
hold a position with his alma mater.
He is a native of Colorado, having
been born at Colorado Springs, al
though his recent years have been
spent in California. Professof* Kirk
wood remained in the place of his
birth until he was ready to go to col
lege, receiving his elementary and
high school education in the puttie
schools there.
Upon completion of his high school
course, the question arose as to where
he should go to college, and he decided
upon Stanford, which had beeu estab
lished for over a decade. It was in
IEOS that Professor Kirkwood ilrst be
came associated with the University.
In the four years up to 1909, when he
received his Bachelor of Arts degree,
he made a brilliant record in the Law
department, and also took an active
interest in student affairs. He be
came a member of the Delta Upsilon
and Delta Chi fraternities, of Phi Beta
Kappa, and the Order of the Coif.
Professor Kirkwood's interest in the
idea of self-government by the stu
dents was given a chance to show
itself in 1908, when he was appointed
to the "President's Conference," and
in 1909, as a member of the of the
"University Conference." These
committees under the direction of Dr.
Jordan, formulated the first plan of
student control, which was successfully
j introduced a year later.
After his graduation from Stanford,

___
Professor Kirkwood went East to
study and attended the Harvard Law
School in 1909 and 1910, returning to |
Stanford the following year to receive |
the degree of Juris Doctor. He left
almost 'immediately for Oklahoma,
where he became assistant professor I
of Law in the state university, teach-1
inp*fliere in 1911 and 1912.
In the fall of 1912 Professor Kirk-;
wood returned to Stanford as a mem-,
ber of the Law school faculty. In \
1915 he was made an associate profes- j
sor and was advanced to the rank I
of professor in 1918.
During the war Professor Kirkwood j
was treasurer of the Stanford-Palo
Alto Belgian Relief Committee, hold-1
ing this office from 1916 to 1919. Un-1
til the introduction of the S. A. T. C.
he was a member of the University
Committee on Military Training, and
did, in addition, such incidental work)
as assisting in the registration and j
filling oui of questionnaires under the
selective service law. He also made
four-minute sppeehes in the interests j
of the various drives and campaigns.
Professor Kirkwood's chosen field
in his professional work is the Law
of Real Property and Equity. He gives,
in addition to courses on these sub
jects, an introduction to the. study of
law and is the author of a work con- j
taining the syllabus and select cases I
on this subject.
In his leisure moments Professor j
Kirkwood may be found serving on !
the Palo Alto Board of the I
Board of Directors of the Stanford
Y. M. C. A., or presiding over the Com
mittee on Student Affairs.
In regard to student government,
Professor Kirkwood believes that I
there are two factors necessary fori
its success. The first is the election
to the councils of students who have
the convictions, and the courage there
of, to enforce a high moral standard.
The second essential is the develop
ment of the sense of responsibility I
in the entire student body, or at least |
j in snme large and influential part ■
j of it.

To the efforts of Professor Marion
Rice Kirkwood of the Law department
is largely due the establishment and
operation of student self-government
at Stanford. In both his undergradu
ate days at the University, when he
took an active part in preparing the
way for its introduction, and more
recently as chairman of the commit
tee on Student Affairs, the name of
Professor Kirkwood has been closely
connected with matters of student
control.
The story of his life is one of rapid
advancement in his chosen profession,
and that of a Stanford man returning
a few years after his graduation to
hold a position with his alma mater.
He is a native of Colorado, having
been born at Colorado Springs, al
though his recent years have been
spent in California. Professof* Kirk
wood remained in the place of his
birth until he was ready to go to col
lege, receiving his elementary and
high school education in the puttie
schools there.
Upon completion of his high school
course, the question arose as to where
he should go to college, and he decided
upon Stanford, which had beeu estab
lished for over a decade. It was in
IEOS that Professor Kirkwood ilrst be
came associated with the University.
In the four years up to 1909, when he
received his Bachelor of Arts degree,
he made a brilliant record in the Law
department, and also took an active
interest in student affairs. He be
came a member of the Delta Upsilon
and Delta Chi fraternities, of Phi Beta
Kappa, and the Order of the Coif.
Professor Kirkwood's interest in the
idea of self-government by the stu
dents was given a chance to show
itself in 1908, when he was appointed
to the "President's Conference," and
in 1909, as a member of the of the
"University Conference." These
committees under the direction of Dr.
Jordan, formulated the first plan of
student control, which was successfully
j introduced a year later.
After his graduation from Stanford,

___
Professor Kirkwood went East to
study and attended the Harvard Law
School in 1909 and 1910, returning to |
Stanford the following year to receive |
the degree of Juris Doctor. He left
almost 'immediately for Oklahoma,
where he became assistant professor I
of Law in the state university, teach-1
inp*fliere in 1911 and 1912.
In the fall of 1912 Professor Kirk-;
wood returned to Stanford as a mem-,
ber of the Law school faculty. In \
1915 he was made an associate profes- j
