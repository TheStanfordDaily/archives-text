Did you ever stop to think that i
"Brick" Morse gives Stanford teams an
awful bawling-out when they beat Cali
j fornia? Take, for example, the box
ers and the basketball squads. Oh,
my, quite too ignorant a bunch of pugs
and lowbrows for words. But when
I we get beaten, why "That's all right,
old man. You were pretty good but
the Wonder-gang of '21 has got you
backed off the map." As George Lin
coln said: "When the shoe is on the
| other foot.
* * *
We must credit the "Bulletin" with
this, "Jimmy Davies, the diminutive
Cardinal, who was recently elected
1922 captain of the Stanford basket
ball team, says thay are out to win
the Conference championship, which
they lost this year." !:j !**s-! We
| doubt very much if he ever said it. He
; won't admit as much.

An old advertisement in the "Daily" J
i goes like this, "Watch that corner! i
i Ferguson's Removal Sale now going J
on. Startling reductions in every de- ,
partment. When we cut. we cut deep." j
We dirln't know they ever had a cut-!
lery shop in Pally.

Another says, "Mr. Carrel will trade j
you a bright new harness or carriage'
for your old one. No charge to see i
him." This gentleman must have been |
a relative of the Wild Man of B.

i The Bowery Bum chewed on ithe
rump steak, pounded, l'or seven weeks
without making an impression, then
bounced it off a brick sidewark and
went away swearing and spitting be
tween his teeth. Now wasn't that
tough.
