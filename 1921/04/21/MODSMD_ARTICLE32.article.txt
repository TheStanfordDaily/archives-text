# TRAINED VOICES FEATURE OPERA
## Double Quartet Features 'our Little Bungalow," by Dan Evans and Myron Higby 
### 
The men's chorus of the Junior
Opera held their first practice last
night. There are eight in the chorus
and the double quartet contains some
fine voices and clever dancers. All
the men have had previous experi
ence in dramatics and Coach Lester
Seib looks forward to little trouble
in getting them into shape. The
chorus has a double quarter arrange
ment of the song "Our Little Bunga
low," by Dan Evans, '20, and Myron
Higby, '22. The song is one which pe
culiarly lends itself to chorus work,
with a harmony in it that the singers
bring out in a pleasing manner. A
little scene with the ponies and bau
ties follows the first singing of the
song to make up the rest of the en
semble.
One of the outstanding things in the
opera this year is the professional tone
which characterizes the direction.
Coach Seib holds his cast to strict
attention to business. He works on
the theory that the time to play is
during the turn off from the footlights
and has all his performers on their
toes all the time they are rehearsing
their parts.
This week will finish a larger share
of the practicing of the separate parts
of the opera and then the several di
visions of the cast will start rehearsing
together. There are more specialty
parts in the show this year than in
previous productions and in addition
one of the most complete plots that
har. even been presented. Some of
the show will be cut in order to make
it come within the time limit that has
been set, but the eliminations will in
no way mar the smooth presentation
of the play.
