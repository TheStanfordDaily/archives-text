# Tri Delt Chimney Stages Fourth of July Celebration
## 
### 
Just as the Tri Delt house was
settling down for a period of peace-;
ful repose after the evening meal,
their chimney flue began a celebration
which would have done credit to the
gayest Fourth of July, and which
threatened the safety and peace of
mind of the fair co-eds who watched
the exhibition. Shrill cries of "Fire"
echoed throughout the countryside as
the maidens pictured their home in
ruins, and the campus responded with
the enthusiasm proper to the occasion.
Amid all the arm waving, one brave
rough thought of using his energy to
turn the handle of a nearby pump.
That, and a few pails of aqua Sears
ville, served to quell all the sputtering
sparks, and by the time the trusty
Stanford fire engine arrived, the flue
fire had flown, and the campus inspec
tors were left free to go home and
talk it over.
