# COMPETITION KEEN IN INTRAMURAL BALL; INTEREST DISPLAYED
## Betas Defeat Zetes in Game Full of Errors; Contests Held Daily on Ball Fields 
### 
The intramural ball nines have swung
this week into the third round of their
season's playing schedule and daily the
competition grows keener between the
various teams of the different leagues.

One of the star games of yesterday's
program was the combat between the
aggregation representing Beta Theta Pi
and the forces of Zeta Psi. The Beta
contingent handed out a 21 to 3 wallop
ing to the Zetes in four and a half in
nings of romping around the infield and
collecting bases from a plentiful supply
of errors. Mike Reed, the Beta hurler,
was the one star of the game. No one
else had any chance to shine for the
first four innings. The first three Zeta
Psi men to bat swung neat circles in the
ether and retired to the chaise longuc.
The Betas got two passes off Smith, the
Zete moundtnan, and both resulted in
tallies, due to the poor support in the
garden. Smith then tightened tip and
retired the next men, one, two, three.
In the second, three more of the Zetes
took the count via the fan route and the
Betas took the bats again. This inning
was a Jonah for the Lagunitans. The
first man up hit to the right, and was
followed by two passes. Then a pop
fly and a boner by the first runner put
up two sinkers for the Betas. This
made things look interesting for a min
ute, but a succession of five hits, a
scratch, and another hit, brought in
eight more runs before the finale of the
frame.

The third frame was a repetition of
the second for the Zetes, one, two, three,
the center one a little infield fly. Two
more runs for the Betas closed this
chapter. In the fourth, all three of the
Zete batters managed to hit the ball â€”
to some one in the Beta infield, and no
one got a glimpse of the initial sack.
Another carnival of slugging followed
during the Beta term with the stick and
hoisted the thermometer up nine degrees
higher.
In the fifth, the first man up for the
Zetes, R. Kinney, got a walk and loped
around the bags on a bunch of class A
errors for the first tally of his aggrega
tion. Two more passes after an out
handed the Zetes two more runs, and
the game ended.
Four other intramural games were
played yesterday also. The results were
as follows:
El Capitan walloped the El Toro boys
by a score of 10 to 3 and the D. U.'s
rolled up 13 points to the Japanese Club's
8. In the Sequoia 2 and 4 contest with
the Theta Xis, the dormitory men went
down to absolute defeat, with a goose
egg after their names while the Theta
Xis managed to accumulate 24 points.
The Theta Delts held the Phi Delts
down to a total of 4 counts, making only
2 points themselves.
