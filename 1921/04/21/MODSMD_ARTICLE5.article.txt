# CARNIVAL CHAPARRAL TO APPEAR TOMORROW
## 
### 
Chaparral will not present its view
point of the Carnival until Friday in
stead of today as was previously an
nounccd. Dorothy Phimmer, '20. eon

tributes again to Chappie art in this issue
and Delia Taylor, '2.3, also has drawn
several cartoons about campus frivoli
ties. Tom Irwin, '23, the Cabbage editor
of the daily, is offering a bit of prose
this time, and many arc the Fablinger
jokes in this issue.
