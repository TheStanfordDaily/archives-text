# VETERAN FACULTY MEMBERS TO STAR IN GAME FRIDAY
## Drs. Jordan, Murray, Angell Will Clash With Seniors For Campus Championship 
### 
The opening event of the FacuUy-
Senior celebration Blated for tomor
row afternoon and evening will be a
baseball game to be played at 4:00 on
the faculty baseball diamond near
the faculty clubhouse.

President Patrick of the Senior Class
has issued a call for all non-varsity
men in the class to sign up for places
on this team as it is desirable to have
a large representation of Seniors pres
ent, and in action.

Information was definitely given out
yesterday, that Drs. Jordan, Murray,
and Angell will be on the diamond and
help the faculty members in annex
ing the long end of the score. These
three men held positions on the first
faculty team organized on the campus
and are reputed to have cleaned up
all opponents. The faculty confidently
assert that they can repeat the trick
again and look forward to Friday's
game in anticipation of a victory.
"Dink" Templeton and "Duffy" Seny
will pitch for the faculty.
Following the game, there will be
a banquet at which the faculty men
will act as hosts, having as their
guests the Senior Class. The evening
will close with a smoker, stunts, and
speeches.
The stunts planned by the committee
in charge will include both senior men
and instructors, which will provide an
interesting evening of entertainment.
This plan was revived last spring in
an effort to bring about a more intimate
relation between faculty and students.
The affair last year was not well at
tended because of a conflict in dates, but
this year's committee is planning a full
attendance of both senior men and
faculty.
Old-time recollections will form a bis:
part of the evening's entertainment.
