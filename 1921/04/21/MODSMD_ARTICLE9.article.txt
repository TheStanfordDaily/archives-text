# STANFORD GOLFERS MEET CALIFORNIA FLAYERS SATURDAY
## 
### 
George Kleiser, Jr., Bernard Frank
enheimer, Millard Rosenblatt, and,
Cecil Putman will meet the California
golf team on the California Club links
in San Francisco. Saturday morning,
at 10 o'clock. The Cardinal team an
nexed a victory last year and has hope
of repeating the process. Putman
was member of last year's team and
is fe consistent player. Rosenblatt and
Frankenheimer both have good re
cords behind them, and Kleckner is a
golfer of the first rank.

Last year's matches were the first
intercollegiate golf that the Cardinal
had played. Golf was started at Stan
ford in '99, when Charlie Dole and
Milnor Roberts organized the first
club. Through the suggestion of Pro
fessor Allardice, head of the Mathe
matics department, the links were
named the Machric Hannish Links,
after a famous course in Scotland.
This club lasted for several years and
then the interest waned. Several at
tempts were made to reorganize the
club but none of them were success
ful until the year before the war.
War activity broke this up and the
next attempt was within the last
month.
Definite plans are now in progress to
build links in the hills south of the
campus and next year will see results.
The course will be nine holes at first
with the view of an eighteen hole
course later. The plans include a
clubhouse and full equipment for
tournaments.
Saturday's matches will be two four
somes and will be played under the
Nassau system of scoring. This sys
tem is one point for the first nine
holes, one for the next nine, and a
point for the game. California's team
will be Fred Lyman, F. Height, J. Vil
lain, and F. La Blond. These men
are old-timers in the links and a vic
tory over them will not be easy.
