# LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS TO HOLD TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 on the
Stanford oval, cinder path enthusiasts
will have a second chance to get a line
on high school track stars when the
Peninsula Athletic League of high
schools meets in the final track fiesta he
fore the state meet which is to he held at
Berkeley on April 29.
The Palo Alto High School track men
arc doped to win the meet, but as there
are not so many schools in this meet as
in the one held here last Saturday, a
harder battle is to be expected. San Jose
is expected to be Palo Alto's nearest
rival, and although they arc not doped
to have as first place men as the
local preps, they are supposed to have
a good many men that will fill in in the
second and third places. There will be
six peninsula high schools entered in the
meet.
