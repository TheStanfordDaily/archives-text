# GALA SWIMMING DAY TOMORROW AS CARD TEAM MEETS BRUINS
## Two World's Champions, Ross and Skelton, to Swim in Exhibition; Stanford Varsity Doped to Win 
### 
The stage is all set for the big swimming day tomorrow, when Stanford's
varsity swimmers meet the California team, and, in addition, Ross and Skel
ton, championship swimmers, give exhibitions of their speed in their favorite
events.
Stanford is represented this year by a strong swimming team... Cali
fornia's squad is far frorrj mediocre, but if the dope runs true, the Cardinal
swimmers will win by about ten points. Coach Brandsten has developed a
team that is well-rounded out and powerful in practically every event.
The relay should go to Stanford... The team made good time in practice
recently and should not have much trouble in winning. Both the fifty and
hundred yard events are expected to go to Austin, who has been hanging up
good marks consistently this season. In the 220, California may take first.

Stanford men figure to come in ahead
In diving, and probably in the breast
stroke, plunge, and back stroke.
Second and third places are hard
to figure, but California will have to
capture most of these if she expects
to have a chance. The cardinal team,
in meets with outside teams which
it has had this year, has shown itself
to be a powerful combination, having
come within a few points of defeat
ing the strong Olympic Club team.
In addition to the meet, exhibition
swimming by two men who hold
world's records in their events will
feature the afternoon program.
Bob Skelton, national champion ex
ponent of the breast stroke, Will show
his speed in an exhibition race. Skel
ton will swim 100 yards against
Charley Fletcher, freshman swimming
captain. The race should be an in
teresting one, as Fletcher makes ex
ceptionally good time in the breast
stroke. Skelton holds the national
220-yard and 440-yard breast stroke
championships, having established
a new world's record, Wednesday
night, at San Francisco, for the form
er. Fletcher can swim the 100 yards
breast stroke in 1:16.2, which is 5 3-5
seconds better than the present Stan
ford-California varsity record.
Skelton is only seventeen years old
and has not yet entered college. His
rise to a position of prominence has
been sudden and he is now regarded
as one of the foremost figures in the
swimming world. In build he is just
the opposite to Norman Ross, weigh
ing only 125 pounds and measuring
five feet nine inches in height. His
endurance is astonishing, and it is
this, together with his powerful leg
drive, that makes him such a pheno
menal swimmer.
Norman Ross, who is known the
world over as the holder of more
swimming records than any other
champion, will appear in exhibition
events against the best Cardinal swim
mers than can oppose him. Ross is
due to show the assembled multitude
faster free style swimming than any
one except Duke Kahanomoku has ever
exhibited here.
The "big moose" holds every world's
record for free style swimming from
220 yards up to one mile. His last
appearance here was in October, 1919,
when he shattered i ten records Sn
succession in one afternoon. His speed
combined with the strength that comes
with his big bulid are the ingredients
that make him a world's champion.
The program will begin promptly at
2:30, the opening event being the re
lay race. Ladies are invited to attend.
Bleachers erected around the pool will
serve to seat the crowd that is expect
ed to attend. The admission will be
35 cents with a student body ticket,
and 75 cents for outsiders.
