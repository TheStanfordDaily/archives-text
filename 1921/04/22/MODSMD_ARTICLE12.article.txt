# OLYMPIC CLUB IS SCENE TONIGHT OF FRESHMAN SWIM
## 
### 
Tonight at 8:00 in the Olympic Club
tank in San Francisco the Stanford-
California freshman swimming meet
takes place. Although greatly weakened
since the start of practice several months
ago by the fact that several of the best
point winners are on probation, the Stan
ford team is by no means a weak outfit
and will give the Bruin cubs a hard
battle for honors.
As the dope stacks up, the Blue and
Gold freshmen should win; but the meet
is expected to be fairly close. They
will probably win most of the points in
the 100-yar#, 220-yard, diving, plunge,
and may take the relay. The Cardinal
freshmen look for an advantage in the
breast stroke, back stroke and 50-yard
swims. Captain Fletcher lias been do
ing fast work in the first two events,
while 'Hooper reels off the fifty and
hundred in good time.
Along with the swimming meet will
be held a water polo game. Coach Brand
sten's men have a good combination and
have looked like winners; but it is the
same story of a good team going up
against one that may be still better.
California's freshman water polo team
beat their varsity. But their varsity was
swamped by Stanford 13-3, so that may
not mean much. A close contest is ex
pected, whoever comes out on top.
