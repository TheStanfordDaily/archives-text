# FOREIGN HONESTY IS EMPHASIZED AT TALK ON CHINA PROBLEMS
## 
### 
Alexander Paul of Wuhu, China, in
his talk yesterday noon at the Stanford
Inn emphasized the importance of hon
est foreigners to China. Under the
system of extra-territoriality which is at
present holding China hack, they are al
most unable to help themselves and are
forced to rely on aliens to carry on
much of their government and more of
their resource development.
Shanghai, the key to interior China,
and the biggest port, is governed by a
council of twelve on which there are
representatives from almost every Euro
pean country and America hut none from
China. They control all the customs and
taxation and the majority of the inhabi
tants, the Chinese, have no voice in their
own governmental destiny. The Chinese
have not even the right to try a foreigner
for crime hut are only entitled to report
the individual to his consul. This con
dition exists all through China.
China is helpless, therefore, in her
own development. She must rely almost
entirely on outsiders to conduct her min
ing, industrial and other developments
which need professional men. There is
unlimited opportunity for capable engi
neers in the East, Mr. Paul said, and
once a man lias convinced the natives
that he is unique enough to be honest,
there is nothing that he cannot do.
