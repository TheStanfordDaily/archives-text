# FRENCH CLUB PLANS BENEFIT FOR ORPHANS
## 
### 
Wednesday, May 11, is the date set
by the Cercle Franeais for the annual
entertainment to raise funds for its two
French orphans. Extensive plans have
been made, and the work is well under
way for providing a diverting evening's
program for the benefit performance.
During the war the Cercle Franeais
adopted two French children whose
fathers were killed and who had no
mothers; and for four years the local
club has been acting as a god father to
them. Entertainments have, been held
once a year to raise the necessary funds
for the care of the orphans.
One feature of the program is to be
the presentation of several choral num
bers by the women. There is need for
additional members of the "500" to
participate in these vocal numbers, and
all those who are interested are request
ed to meet in the Woman's Club House
on Tuesday afternoon at 4:30 o'clock.
The songs are easy and popular
French numbers, and a knowledge of
French is not at all necessary to those
taking part. The work will be under
the direction of Miss Jessie Smith of the
Romanic Languages department.
