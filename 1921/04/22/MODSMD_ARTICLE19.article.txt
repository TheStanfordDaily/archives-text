# HOW LARGE IS CLASS THREE?
## 
### 
College students have been divided into three classes: the so-called
leaders who formulate and initiate and. take prominent part in student
action and activity, those who are interested and willing- to follow plans
and suggestions of others but who of their own accord would not assume
responsibility or "put over" anything," and those who are not interested
in nor conscious of the welfare of their university.
Of these the third class is probably the most important as it is
usually the largest, and it is the greatest drawback to successful student
activity. The spirit of the university is measured by this class of almost
"dead weight." The class is l made up of many types, including those
who wholly subordinate athletics to books, those who subordinate activity
to social functions, dancing, and city parties, those who have never
seriously tried themselves on track or field, and those who willingly take
a "C" in a course when with little more effort they may get an "A."
The problem of improving the standard of Stanford activity in the
university world is the problem of getting rid of this class of students.
1 lie past record of the Cardinal is due to men without apparent ability
who, because of interest in student activity, worked hard in some field
until they finally "came through."
When every university student is willing to try honestly on the oval
for two years to make of himself a quarter-miler, when he is willing to
take responsibility and initiative in directing and supervising such events
as class contests to see that they progress along right lines, or is willing
to work, with those who will take initiative, when he is willing to leave
the Mercer in the garage and report for spring football practice or labor
in an office to improve the comic magazine or yearbookâ€”we will not
worry further over success in big meets or general Cardinal reputation.
Stanford has been most successful when the third class of students
has been the smallest. Every student who takes himself out of this class
into class one or two will add one digit to the component parts which
make up the real Stanford spirit, and he awards himself the possibility
of doing an even more material part in the future. He does more for
himself than that, for he places himself on the right side of the fence.
Any one may name the Stanford graduates who have been most suc
cessful in world activity, and tell if they were "class three" men in
college.

COACH BRANDSTEN'S SWIMMERS are ready to give the
Berkeley mermen a mighty stiff struggle tomorrow afternoon at the
Encina tank. Norman Ross, the great record-breaker, who worked
under Bransten several years ago, always performs well in the Stanford
pool, and may go wild again tomorrow. Skelton, who will also perform,
is one of the youngest record-holders.
