# PRESIDENT WILBUR WILL LEAD FOREIGN STUDENT DISCUSSION
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur will lead
a discussion upon the subject, "The
Relation of the Native to the Foreign
Students of the University," at an open
meeting of {he Cosmopolitan Club to be
held next Monday evening at 8 o'clock.
This question has been made timely by
recent public action against the Filipino
Club House in Palo'Alto a short time
ago, and by the recent letter of resigna
tion of Nemesio Agunod, secretary of
the foreign students in the Cosmopolitan
Club, in which he stated that because of
the prejudice against foreigners on the
campus he felt obliged to leave Stan
ford for another university.
One representative from each of the
foreign groups in the organization will
be given a limited time in which to make
clear his version of the attitude on the
Stanford campus toward the foreign
clubs at the university.
- The Cosmopolitan Club hopes that the
discussion will serve to formulate some
definite plans ahd future work for its
attention.
