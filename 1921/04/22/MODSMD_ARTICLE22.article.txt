# Freshmen Will Work On Carnival Saturday
## 
### 
All members of the freshman class are
asked to report at the Cran
nival Saturday morning at 8 o'clock at
the Encina gymnasium. It is imperative
to complete the clean-up on this day so
that the athletic teams may use the
space. The workers will be checked off
on a list.
