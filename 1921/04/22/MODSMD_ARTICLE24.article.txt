A campus attraction, that compares
favorably with disinterred corner
stones for general interest in the
antique, is found in the shape of "our
own postoffice." Rare specimens of
art by old masters, antiquities beyond
compare, and a collection of printed
posters of the Homeric Age festoon
the walls of our community gallery.
For the benefit of those who receive
mail so seldom that they never ap
proach this priceless store of super
ancients, the following samples are
enclosed:
* * *
"Save your child from autocracy and
poverty! Help hunt the Hun." This
infamous work of art was immensely
popular among the ancient Greeks and
Greek Letters. It has only lost its
prestige through selfish ownership by
one party who seems to want to with
hold it from the world. One of the
chief attractions. The first line is
appropriately chosen t'or college tastes.
» * *
"Public Notice No. 1" is only ex
celled in rarity by Pub. No. 2. They
deal with ancient government policies.
These, in particular, emphasize insur
ance policies."
* * *
"A happy New Year is in store for
those who work and save." This is
an old maxim supposed to have had
its origin in mediaeval folk-lore. It
is £ line of decided interest to stu
dents of old English.
* • •
"Save and invest in safest, simplest
security. Buy W. S. S.!" Thought the
w-s-s stood for "We Swipe Signs."
They keep what they already have,
anyway. Drop in next time you have
got an hour off.
♦ * *
It is rumored that the old Museum
is about to retire from the field of
such active, but innocent, competition.

We got knocked off the back porch
last, night for this one. A thin man,
who was trying to gain weight, saw
a person, who was supporting super
fluous adipose Mssue, weighing him
self. After watching the balance hand
gyrate madly,, the skinny gent wrath
fully asked, "How do you get that
weigh?"
* ♦ *
"Brick" Morse has been dubbed with
a new handle. Because he is such a
good Bruin, certain of hiß readers have
announced their intention of calling
him "Growler."
* ♦ •
"That's the worst boot I ever pulled,"
remarked the shoe clerk as he changed
the tramp's brogahs.
