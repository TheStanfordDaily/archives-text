### 
Work in Stanfotd's departments of
Zoology and Physiology t is not by any
means a summer vacation, but, along
with courses in Botany and English
is given in a summer vacation loca
tion. The Hopkins Marine Station,
to which me Departments of Zoology
and Physiology transfer all their class
es during the summer quarter, is si
tuated at Pacific Grove on the south
side of Monterey Bay and the Univer
sity reservation of nearly 5 acres com
prises the main part of Cabrillo Point.
This site insures complete control
of the coast line of tho point and pro
vides a sheltered landing place for
boats engaged in collecting from the
extremely varied marine fauna which
is found on the coast at that point.
Furthermore the territory immediately
adjoining affords a rich range of land
fauna and flora. As a result, the stu
dent of marine life has available for
his purposes a surprisingly large num
ber of animals and plants, including
not only the species found between
tide levels but also those which dwell
in the open ocean and those which
are collected by dredging at various
depths, and the student of land forms
finds an equally interesting and, in
some ways, peculiar assemblage of
material. This is due to an annual
variety of conditions within a small
area and to the presence of a num
ber of characteristic and dominant
types such as Monterey cypress and
the Monterey pine. Thus students of
all forms of life, both beginners and
men of science carrying on individual
research work, are able to observe
and study many forms of plant life
and the simpler animal life as well as
a large number of live animals while
these are living their ordinary lives.
These studies are made attractive by
the climate which for many years has
rendered this part of California popular
as a summer resort.
As a result the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion of Stanford University is utilized
both by regular undergraduate stu-

dents of the University and by special
ists who come here from all parts of
the country to use the special labora
tories which are put at their disposal
by the University without charge.
Many of the most recent of these
scientists is Dr. Edwin Grant Conk
lin, professor of biology at Prince
ton, who is one of the best, certainly
one of the three best embryologists in
this country. He will spend two
months at the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion carrying 011 investigations par
ticularly along the lines of his own
particular interests which recently
have chiefly concerned the mechanism
of heredity.
During this winter among the sci
entists who have been doing work
at the Station are Professor Myra
Sampson, of Smith College, who is
working on the chemistry of fertiliza
tion; Dr. Gertrude Van Wagenen, who
is investigating the corals and actini
ana, of the Monterey region; Dr. Tage
Skogsberg, of the University of Up
sala, Sweden, who is working on a
group of minute crustacea, and ostra
coda; W. P. Thompson, Lance Sco
fleld, and C. S. McGregor, who are
investigating the life history of the
sardine, salmon, and albacore, under
the auspices of the State Fish Com
mission. Dr. Walter Kenrick Fisher,
director of the Station, is himself
working 011 a monograph of all the sea
stars of the north Pacific and adja
cent arctic oceans.
The University keeps the Hopkins
Marine Station open throughout the
year for investigators and special stu
dents, but schedules regular class in
struction for the summer quarter
only. In these summer quarter cours
es an attempt is made to get away
from "biology in bottles" to a con
sideration of living things.
A regular student of the University
may take a full quarter's course at
the Marine Station, or one or two
single courses may be taken accord
ing to the student's interests or needs.

the country to use the special labora
tories which are put at their disposal
by the University without charge.
Many of the most recent of these
scientists is Dr. Edwin Grant Conk
lin, professor of biology at Prince
ton, who is one of the best, certainly
one of the three best embryologists in
this country. He will spend two
months at the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion carrying 011 investigations par
ticularly along the lines of his own
particular interests which recently
have chiefly concerned the mechanism
of heredity.
During this winter among the sci
entists who have been doing work
at the Station are Professor Myra
Sampson, of Smith College, who is
working on the chemistry of fertiliza
tion; Dr. Gertrude Van Wagenen, who
is investigating the corals and actini
ana, of the Monterey region; Dr. Tage
Skogsberg, of the University of Up
sala, Sweden, who is working on a
group of minute crustacea, and ostra
coda; W. P. Thompson, Lance Sco
fleld, and C. S. McGregor, who are
investigating the life history of the
sardine, salmon, and albacore, under
the auspices of the State Fish Com
mission. Dr. Walter Kenrick Fisher,
director of the Station, is himself
working 011 a monograph of all the sea
stars of the north Pacific and adja
cent arctic oceans.
The University keeps the Hopkins
Marine Station open throughout the
year for investigators and special stu
dents, but schedules regular class in
struction for the summer quarter
only. In these summer quarter cours
es an attempt is made to get away
from "biology in bottles" to a con
sideration of living things.
A regular student of the University
may take a full quarter's course at
the Marine Station, or one or two
single courses may be taken accord
ing to the student's interests or needs.
Work in Stanfotd's departments of
Zoology and Physiology t is not by any
means a summer vacation, but, along
with courses in Botany and English
is given in a summer vacation loca
tion. The Hopkins Marine Station,
to which me Departments of Zoology
and Physiology transfer all their class
es during the summer quarter, is si
tuated at Pacific Grove on the south
side of Monterey Bay and the Univer
sity reservation of nearly 5 acres com
prises the main part of Cabrillo Point.
This site insures complete control
of the coast line of tho point and pro
vides a sheltered landing place for
boats engaged in collecting from the
extremely varied marine fauna which
is found on the coast at that point.
Furthermore the territory immediately
adjoining affords a rich range of land
fauna and flora. As a result, the stu
dent of marine life has available for
his purposes a surprisingly large num
ber of animals and plants, including
not only the species found between
tide levels but also those which dwell
in the open ocean and those which
are collected by dredging at various
depths, and the student of land forms
finds an equally interesting and, in
some ways, peculiar assemblage of
material. This is due to an annual
variety of conditions within a small
area and to the presence of a num
ber of characteristic and dominant
types such as Monterey cypress and
the Monterey pine. Thus students of
all forms of life, both beginners and
men of science carrying on individual
research work, are able to observe
and study many forms of plant life
and the simpler animal life as well as
a large number of live animals while
these are living their ordinary lives.
These studies are made attractive by
the climate which for many years has
rendered this part of California popular
as a summer resort.
As a result the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion of Stanford University is utilized
both by regular undergraduate stu-

dents of the University and by special
ists who come here from all parts of
the country to use the special labora
