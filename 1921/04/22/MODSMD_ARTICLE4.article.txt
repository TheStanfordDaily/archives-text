# Sequoia and Roble Halls to Hold Exchange Dinners
## 
### 
Sequoia Eating Club and Roble Hall
will hold exchange dinners on May 10
and May 17. The matter of exchange
dinners between the two halls was pro
posed last quarter, but the final decision
â– was not made until this week.
At each dinner thirty-five Roble
women will go to Sequoia and thirty five
men will ro to Roble. Sequoia plans to
have open house on those dates so that
the women who used to live in Old Roble
may visit their old rooms.
