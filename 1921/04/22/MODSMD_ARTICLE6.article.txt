on American history and literary topics.
"Forty Years of Publishing," and "All
the Monthly Magazines," are two of his
most popular literary lectures.
"The Writing Game," his latest lec
ture, is his subject for Tuesday night.
It contains facts about writing that he
has learned during his long connection
with the journalistic world, and is in the
main part, a study of writing It treats
of what college training does for au
thorship, with reference to question
of whether or not writing can be taught.
In preparing this lecture, Mr. Ellsworth
sent out questionaires to sixteen popular
short story writers, among whom are
Rooth Tarkington, Fannie Hurst, Edna
Ferber, and Mary Raymond Shipman
Andrews. In these questionaires he in
quired the opinions of these authors on
the problem of whether ability to write
can be taught in a university, and in the
lecture he quotes from their answers.
He also takes up several other phases
of the writing game during the talks.
