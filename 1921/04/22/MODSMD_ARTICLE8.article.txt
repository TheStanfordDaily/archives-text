# RUTH ST. DENIS OFFERS VARIED PROGRAM HERE
## Performance Characterized as "Supremely Delightful," "Most Original," by Critic 
### Melba Berry, '22 
In viewing a performance as su
premely delightful as that of Ruth St.
Denis and Ted Shawn of yesterday
evening it is difficult to make any
definite criticism of the several parts
of the program. The atmosphere of
the Assembly Hall more resembled
that of at home parlor, with delightful
guests entertaining. Ruth St. Denis
clearly gave this impression to her
audience last night through her
charming personality, which was per
haps more lovely and pleasing than
her dancing.
The dancing, itself, was beautiful
and effective, executed with masterful
technique, possibly best exemplified
by Ruth St. Denis, herself, who is so
thoroughly familiar with her art that
her style seemed wholly natural and
free.
The Siamese dance by Ted Shawn
and Ruth St. Denis was the most ef
fective performance in which costumes
themselves were a very material part
exquisite as they were and among the
most rare and valuable used.
Ted Shawn in his "Invocation to a
Thunderbird" was well received in the
dance which is always one of his most
popular. Shawn's dancing is virile and
splendid. He has a wonderful mastery
of his art, and a stage presence that
imparts an expectation of something
fine and wonderful.
The splendidness ot' the program
was emphasized by the contrast of the
simply yet pleasing dances of the
Denishawn girls. Facial expressions
and characterization played a large
part in their offerings. "Dancing to
Betty's Music Box" was their most
popular piece of work.
To Miss Ann Thompson, pianist, is
due credit for much of the success of
the evening.
The pianist is generally the silent
partner who does half of the work,
takes more than her share of the
responsibility and gets little or no
credit. But Ann Thompson could not
be felt to be the silent partner type,
and she was too vitally present to be
forgotten and her music too superior.
Her work was thoroughly enjoyed.
