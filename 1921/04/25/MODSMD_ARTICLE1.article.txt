### C. S. Shoup, '24 
Stanford's swimming varsity held a
clean-up day Saturday afternoon with
California s team as the victim, and
when the drowning process was over the
score read 51-17. Seven first places out
of the eight events, along with many
seconds and thirds, piled up Cardinal
points. No records were broken in the
meet. The afternoon was featured by
the exhibition swimming of Ross and
Skelton, holders, respectively, of free
style and breast stroke swimming rec
ords.

The first event of the afternoon, the
relay, went to Stanford. At the end of
the second lap the teams were eve.: but
the California men could not keep up
the pace set by the last two Cardinal
.swimmers. From then on it was appar
ent that it was only a question of how
badly California was to be defeated.
MacConnell won the fifty yard in a close
finish, and Sparling captured the breast
.stroke by a big margin. The 220 yard
swim was the only event that went to
California. Thomas and Darling took
second and third for Stanford.

Stern showed endurance and won the
100 yard back stroke. In the last race
of the afternoon, the 100 yard free style,
Austin took the lead and held it to the
finish. First place in diving was award
ed to Lacey. Landis showed good form
in his second attempt at the plunge and
won by going 63 feet 5 inches.

In between the regular events were
exhibition races by Norman Ross and
Bill Skelton. Ross swam a 220 yard
free style lacc against a relay team of
five Stanford men, and won, covering
the distance in 2:27. The world's rec
ord for this race is 2:20 2-5. Ross
started out at a strong clip and held it
steadily throughout practically the. en
tire race. Skelton exhibited a burst of
speed in reeling off a 100 yard breast
stroke against Charley Fletcher, coming
in ahead with the time of 1:14 1-5. Al
though his style of swimming may not
have seemed theoretically correct, it got
results. Skelton shows up even better
in the longer distances, as his remark
able endurance enables him to keep up
the pace he sets over a long period.
Fletcher did not come in far behind and
probably made the distance in under
1:17.
A good-sized crowd was on hand to
witness the afternoon's program, both
sides of the north section of the bleach
ers being filled. Except for a wind that
blew in gusts at various times, the
weather conditions were good.

Stanford's swimming varsity held a
clean-up day Saturday afternoon with
California s team as the victim, and
when the drowning process was over the
score read 51-17. Seven first places out
of the eight events, along with many
seconds and thirds, piled up Cardinal
points. No records were broken in the
meet. The afternoon was featured by
the exhibition swimming of Ross and
Skelton, holders, respectively, of free
style and breast stroke swimming rec
ords.

The first event of the afternoon, the
relay, went to Stanford. At the end of
the second lap the teams were eve.: but
the California men could not keep up
the pace set by the last two Cardinal
.swimmers. From then on it was appar
ent that it was only a question of how
badly California was to be defeated.
MacConnell won the fifty yard in a close
finish, and Sparling captured the breast
.stroke by a big margin. The 220 yard
swim was the only event that went to
California. Thomas and Darling took
second and third for Stanford.

Stern showed endurance and won the
100 yard back stroke. In the last race
of the afternoon, the 100 yard free style,
Austin took the lead and held it to the
finish. First place in diving was award
ed to Lacey. Landis showed good form
in his second attempt at the plunge and
won by going 63 feet 5 inches.

In between the regular events were
exhibition races by Norman Ross and
Bill Skelton. Ross swam a 220 yard
free style lacc against a relay team of
five Stanford men, and won, covering
the distance in 2:27. The world's rec
ord for this race is 2:20 2-5. Ross
started out at a strong clip and held it
steadily throughout practically the. en
tire race. Skelton exhibited a burst of
speed in reeling off a 100 yard breast
stroke against Charley Fletcher, coming
in ahead with the time of 1:14 1-5. Al
though his style of swimming may not
have seemed theoretically correct, it got
results. Skelton shows up even better
in the longer distances, as his remark
able endurance enables him to keep up
the pace he sets over a long period.
Fletcher did not come in far behind and
probably made the distance in under
1:17.
A good-sized crowd was on hand to
witness the afternoon's program, both
sides of the north section of the bleach
ers being filled. Except for a wind that
blew in gusts at various times, the
weather conditions were good.
