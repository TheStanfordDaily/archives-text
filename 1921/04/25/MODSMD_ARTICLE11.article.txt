natius College, Friday evening, In the
Little Theater, on the question: "lie
solved, That the United States is justi
fied in maintaining tie present system
of Panama Canal tolls." The debate
was held in San Francisco, Wednesday
night. Both sides conceded the af
firmative to the strongest debaters.
Homer Brown, '22, opened the debate
for Nestoria, maintained that under
existing treaties the United States
cannot exempt her coastwise vessels
from tolls. T. I. Fitzpatrick, the first
speaker for St. Ignatius, pointed out
that the diplomats who negotiated the
treaties did not inform the Senate at
the time of ratification that they were
to cover coastwise shipping. J. C #
Webb, '24, Nestoria's second speaker,
said that the Senate was not hood
winked, and that legally we could not
crawl out of the treaties. N. B. Mareo
vich, second speaker for St. Ignatius,
made the point that coastwise ship
ping needed aid because of competi
tion with Canada.
Lowell Gerson, '22, the concluding
speaker for Nestoria, said that it
would be economically unwise to ex
empt coastwise shipping, as it did not
need it, whereas tran-ocean vessels
did M. H. O'Brien, St. Ignatius' last
speaker, concluded the debate by
pointing out the beneficial effect of
the exemption of coastwise shipping
on the general economic prosperity |
