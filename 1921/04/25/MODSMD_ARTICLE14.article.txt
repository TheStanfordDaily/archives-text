tories and no defeats. Phi Delta .Theta
has maintained the same record among
the second bunch of competitors. In
the third league Delta Chi and Tlieta Xi
have three straight wins apiece, while
the Breakers aggregation has anhexed
two games and has lost none. Of the
next congregation, Beta Theta Pi and
Kappa Sigma have shown the most class
so far, and have trotted forth two slab
artists who hurl ball considerably better
tlian the average intramural twirler. Af-'
plia Chi Sigma heads the fifth league and
has proved three times that medics can
cut a mean swath in the national pas
time. Games postponed from round
three will be played off this week.

Delta Chi diamond artists trotted
across the home rubber ten times while
the Phi Kappa Sigma nine garnered five
runs in intramural baseball Friday.
Swartz, last year's freshman twirlcr,
pitched pood hall for Phi Kappa Sigma
during the first four innings, receiving
rather meager support from his team
mates. However, the onslaught by the
Delta Chi batsmen accumulated in the
fifth frame and Swartz weakened, let
ting in four runs. The playing was
characterized by much superior fielding
on the part of the victors, shortstop
Tritle, especially, being a considerable
bulwark in the infield gardens. Bat
teries: Delta Chi, Coplen and Gorman:
Phi Kappa Sigma, Swartz and Hall, and
Craiglow.
Friday's contest between Delta Tau
Delta and Alpha Kappa Lambda con
tained excellent instruction in the art of
raising batting averages. Twenty-eight
tallies wore scored altogether, members
of the Delta Tau Delta aggregation
romping atound the bags for twenty of
them. Collet and Tussing of the win
ning team wielded a wicked war clul»
and were responsible for four runs
apiece. Although errors by both contin
gents i were numerous, most of the bits
Utiade were bona fide wallops. Tn the
last inning, one of the Alpha Kappa
Lambda batters gave a remarkable imi
tation of '"Babe" Ruth when he started
the white sphere in the direction of May
field, sending in two men before him.
Batteries: Delta Tau Delta, Collet and
Tognazzini; Alpha Kappa Lambda,
Cornell, Jongeneel, and Van Bibber.

With the opening of the fourth round of
intramural baseball today, leaders of the
five leagues are "(Jutting in a fairly con
spicuous appearance. Sigma Chi tops
the list in league one, having three vic
tories and no defeats. Phi Delta .Theta
has maintained the same record among
the second bunch of competitors. In
the third league Delta Chi and Tlieta Xi
have three straight wins apiece, while
the Breakers aggregation has anhexed
two games and has lost none. Of the
next congregation, Beta Theta Pi and
Kappa Sigma have shown the most class
so far, and have trotted forth two slab
artists who hurl ball considerably better
tlian the average intramural twirler. Af-'
plia Chi Sigma heads the fifth league and
has proved three times that medics can
cut a mean swath in the national pas
time. Games postponed from round
three will be played off this week.

Delta Chi diamond artists trotted
across the home rubber ten times while
the Phi Kappa Sigma nine garnered five
runs in intramural baseball Friday.
Swartz, last year's freshman twirlcr,
pitched pood hall for Phi Kappa Sigma
during the first four innings, receiving
rather meager support from his team
mates. However, the onslaught by the
Delta Chi batsmen accumulated in the
fifth frame and Swartz weakened, let
ting in four runs. The playing was
characterized by much superior fielding
on the part of the victors, shortstop
Tritle, especially, being a considerable
bulwark in the infield gardens. Bat
teries: Delta Chi, Coplen and Gorman:
Phi Kappa Sigma, Swartz and Hall, and
Craiglow.
Friday's contest between Delta Tau
Delta and Alpha Kappa Lambda con
tained excellent instruction in the art of
raising batting averages. Twenty-eight
tallies wore scored altogether, members
of the Delta Tau Delta aggregation
romping atound the bags for twenty of
them. Collet and Tussing of the win
ning team wielded a wicked war clul»
and were responsible for four runs
apiece. Although errors by both contin
gents i were numerous, most of the bits
Utiade were bona fide wallops. Tn the
