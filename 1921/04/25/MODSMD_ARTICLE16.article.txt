# SAVE WORK
## 
### 
The ordinary student may learn something from those who do go on
probation. Of those who get the fatal notices from the registrar there
are possibly two types, students who are intermittently on and off "pro"
for the whole of their college days, and students who proceed at once to
get off and leave a safe margin between their subsequent standing and
the line of failure.
A student on first failure in a professional department a year ago
was asked pointedly if he would prefer to transfer to some field to
which he was more adapted. The student could not see the idea, and
last quarter drew a strong "B" average. The first failure caused him to
get away from his catch-as-can progression from one subject to another
through the day, led him to put in regular study hours and'to be careful
of-class attendance. He limited the number of "sessions," wasted few
afternoons from 3 to 6 p. m., and made normal preparation for each
examination. Yet we noticed that he still had time to earn a substantial
portion of his expenses and did not altogether neglect Mr. Whitmer or
Charlie Chaplin.
â–  Many of us stagger along near the line all the time and because
there is nothing in particular to wake us up, take no accounting. A
first failure notice might make "A" students of quite a number of those
below the great majority. We are not advocating more probation no
tices, but nterely suggesting that systematization on the part of some of
ns may save such notices in the future.
Systematization may produce better grades with less effort and leave
more time for recreation. Almost every student believes he is already
going his own limit. Most of them find on necessity, too, that they can
almost double the.ir work and still go as well as before. Most of us are
taking quite enough work, but a revision or planning of each day's
program may produce better classroom results and leave more free time
for athletics or whatever may be most enjoyed.
