# A 						STANFORD MOVEMENT
## 
### 
Edward H. Lockwood, '14, has for several years been stationed as
Stanford's particular representative in China, performing great con
strictive wok in what is sometimes termed the frontier of our present
civilization. The Stanford'community has each year by small contri
butions provided for the maintenance of the activity of the far-eastern
representative. —-
On the part of many students the call for aid this year will be met
by the inward or possibly more evident reaction, "another drive." Yet
there have been fewer drives on the Stanford campus than that of the
average university this year. Most eastern colleges without personal
representatives have already given substantial amounts to the China
famine relief fund because of the urgent necessity of aid to save lives
ill that unfortunate nation. The regular China famine relief drive which
has been conducted throughout the colleges of the United States has not
been promoted here. •>
The Lockwood campaign is not "another drive." It is the regular
Stanford activity that has been conducted for many years to support one
of its graduates in work he has undertaken, and it is worth more than the
ordinary consideration of any student who can do without one trip to the
movies.
