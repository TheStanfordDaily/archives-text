Editor Daily Palo Alto:
A question of vital importance is at
issue in the student body election that
is at hand. For an amendment is to he
voted upon that may have a revitalizing
effect upon student body government.
No one can deny that there is a woeful
lack of interest in student bojly elections.
Time and again, important offices have
gone to candidates by white ballots. This
happened at our last student body elec
tion. This may be due to the fact that
under the present system of making
nominations the number of candidates
for any office is not known until after
the nominations have been closed. The
system does not in all cases rouse the
keen interest in the elections that is to
be associated with more open methods
of making nominations.
With the hope that it might create re
newed interest in student affairs, Nes
tor ia Debating Society, by petition,
placed upon the ballot an amendment, at
the last election, providing for a nomi
nating assembly. The amendment re
ceived a two thirds majority of the
votes cast ui>on it, but not of the total
vote cast. The amendment was declared
to have failed. Nestoria appealed from
the decision to Dean Huston, on the
ground that under the wording of the
Constitution the amendment had passed.
For by the weight of American and
English law under the present wording
of the A. S. S. U. Constitution an
amendment stands adopted when it re
ceives a two-thirds majority of the
votes cast upon the proposition, even
though not a two-thirds majority of the
votes cast at the election. Those failing
to vote on the proposition are assumed
to acquiesce in the result. The case has
been pending for several months in order
that the opponents of the measure might
have ample time to submit an answering
brief. This brief has never been sub
mitted.
~ The opponents of the amendment have
now submitted a proposal calling for its
repeal. Whether we favor or oppose
the plan of a nominating assembly, does
it not seem the fairest policy to give i,t
just one trial at least before we vote it
out of existence? If a student assembly
at which nominations will by made from
the floor, will renew interest in our elec
tions and bring out the best men for stu
dent offices, it certainly would be to our
advantage to retain it. Rut if the amend
ment fails of its purpose after a fair trial
then let us legislate it out of existence.
Certainly it is an issue which should j
commend itself to the earnest considera-1
tion of every interested voter at the coin 1
ing election.
