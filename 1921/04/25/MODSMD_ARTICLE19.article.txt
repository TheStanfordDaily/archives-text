major in minors.

After looking at our last Water j
Transportation ex. paper, we are in- j

"Christmas comes once a year." It |

Pardon for changing the subject, but:
this was found up in the Library last
Friday: "Last nite I was late to dinner
and as I was going down (crossed out,
but legible) came out and smlJ/Cd so

should furnish ample interest to de
light the heart of the most skeptical.
The missive was penned on a five-and
a-half by eight looseleaf notebook
papgr, on the upper third of the back
notes on "Lesson 22, Spanish gram

violet ink and the recipient blurred
it all up with green. Incidentally, the
"I's" were "dotted with circles" and
the "T's" looked like plus marks.

Certain abbreviations indicated up
perclass standing—long practice In
note taking, as well as note-writiug.

All you Spanish snakes took 'em
over tomorrow. Find the violent
pen with the violet Ink. But it won't
do you any good unless your Initials
are "L.S." There are only eleven in
the Bawl-Out. The field is limited.

The "Daily" Is going to press.
"Thrilled? Gee, I can hardly eat" — i
fast enough.

NOW, ISN'T THAT A HECK OF A
NOTE?
