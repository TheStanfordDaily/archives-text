"lndia is ready for freedom and she
must be set free," declared Kenneth J.
Saunders in the third of a series of lec
tures on East and West: International
Problems. Enumerating the advantages
gained by India from English occupa
tion, the lecturer said, "Since 1858, when
Queen Victoria became personally re
sponsible for the rule in India, the pop
ulation has increased 100,000,000. Trade
has increased nearly five fold. Thirty
two thousand miles of railway and 60,-
000 miles of irrigating canals have been
built. These figures mean that the '
British have worked for their own in
terests as well as for the people of the
country.
The problem has been a great one,
with '1)0 independent provinces in India,
147 different languages and eight great
religions all very much alive and in
cluding 70,000,000 Mohammedans under
the Caliphate of Turkey. India has
been treated with paternal justice,'
marred by faults, no doubt, but on the
whole, English occupation has been
beneficial. This old order whose key
note was paternalism is now dead or
dying and we arc passing on to the new
order of a better vyorld. England with
Insufferable priggishness undertook
carry the burdens of Asia. She must
give up doing things for India and leave
India to help herself.
"England has given the natives the
control of their great system of educa
tion and the power to handle their in
dustries, chiefly agriculture. Ift.it she
kept wie power over the purse-strings,
which is essential in that control. Fifty
per cent of the taxes go to the mainte
nance of the army, for India, is a great
strategic point in the British Empire.
"Personifying the demands of the
Indian Nationalists is the greatest figure
on the whole human stage, the great
spiritual genius, Gundy. Hhe is saving
India today from bloodshed. He is
holding back the forces of anarchy.
Says Mr. Gundy, 'You must not strike
or fight. Your cause is just. You can
win it by simply showing that you dis
approve of the exploitation of our peoj;
pie by the English. They may be well
meaning, but in giving us our modern
industries and our educational institu
tions they are killing our soul.'"
Mr. Saunders will lecture next Sunday
on Korea and Japan.
