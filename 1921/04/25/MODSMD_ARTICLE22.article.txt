# GIANT CATERPILLAR WITH MOUNTED GUN STOPS HERE ON RUN
## 
### 
Those who saw the giant caterpillar
tractor, with a gun mounted on it,
racing up and down the near and far,
on Friday afternoon need have no
fear. It cannot fly and the gun isn't
loaded. But the latter can be and
can shoot accurately. The large trac
tor is a product of the Holt Tractor
' Works of Fresno, and has been on a
test run from Fresno to San Fran
cisco, and is now on the return trip.
The machine is capable of a speed
of niGie than twenty-five miles per
hour actual test, and when one con
siders iliat the usual speed of a cater
pillar is about four to six miles per
hour, twenty-five is going some. Con
trol the same as in an automobile, is
a feature of the tractor, and the belt
tread upon which it operates is made
with rubber inserts to make the trav
eling on roads at high speed possible.
An eight cylinder Holt V-shape type
motor is the power plant and the
engine is made sq nearly water tight
that the tractor will run while almost
submerged.
Thursday, at the Presidio in San
Francisco, firing tests were made with
the gun mount of the tractor. So solid
is the base that the recoil of the 155
mm. gun which it mounts, made no
perceptible deviation whatsoever in
the sighting when the carriage was
once set.
While here the officers in charge
took a number of students and faculty
for rides around the campus, through
( the courteous arrangement of Major
Collins. The thrill of making the
short corners and going over ditches
has the roller coasters beat all hollow,
according to the people who took
rides.
The tractor and gun will be sent on
j a trip up into Oregon at an early date
] according to the officers in charge of
] the trip. Strenuous tests are being
j applied to the caterpillar previous to
] its installation as an artillery unit.
