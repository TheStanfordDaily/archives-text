# WOULD TURN STADIUM MONEY TO ROBLE GYM
## 
### 
A movement has been launched to
have the members of the Stanford
Alumnae interested in the develop
ment of women's athletics and those
who are making subscriptigns of S-iOO
or more to the Stadium Fund, desig
nate that their contributions be ulti
mately used for the erection and equip
ment of a new women's gymnasium.
The present women's gymnasium
was built thirty years ago, during the
first year of the University. Then it
was equipped, with the best material
available.
In the last few years, the enroll
ment of the department and the num
ber of sports in which the women take
part has grown to such an extent that
the building and grounds are not large
enough to accommodate the students.
All who wish their subscriptions to
be used for this fund are asked to
make the stipulation when sending in
3 their contributions\
