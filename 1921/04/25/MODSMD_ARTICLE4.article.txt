# WOMEN SWIMMERS TEAM TO BE PICKED
## 
### 
Representative upper and lower class
teams will be chosen to compete with the
two teams from Mills College in the
women's swimming meet to be held at
the Roble pool Saturday morning at 10.
The two squads will be chosen by the
coach from those who have been trying
out this quarter. Not more than three
Contestants will be entered in each race
and no contestant will be allowed to
swim in more than four events, the re
lay counting as an event. The meet
will be run off in the same manner as
an ordinary interclass meet.

Results of practice show the prospects
of two very good teams. Enthusiasm
for swimming has been unusually
strong this year, more people coming out
for regular practice than ever before.
The events of next Saturday will in
clude the 25-yard dash, 50-yard breast
stroke, 25-yard back stroke, 50-yard
free, 100-yard free, and the relay, be
sides the plunge for distance and diving.
Alverda West, who broke the Pacific
Coast record in the plunge for distance
last year, is entered for the plunge on
Saturday. Dorothy George, Doris Stev
enson, both of whom were named on the
women's all-star swimming team last
fall, will compete in the diving.
It is hoped that there will be a big
attendance along the side lines at the
meet.
