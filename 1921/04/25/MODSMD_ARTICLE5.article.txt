In the first part of his lecture, Mr.

authorship can be taught in a university.
In preparing this part of his lecture, he
sent out questionnaires to sixteen popu
lar short story writers, in which he
asked their opinions in this subject of
whether it is possible to teach writing;
and in order to help prove his ideas
about the matter, he will quote from
the answers he received to those ques
tionnaires.
