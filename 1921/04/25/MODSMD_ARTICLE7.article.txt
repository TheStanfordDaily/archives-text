# LOCAL BASEBALL TEAM LOSES TO CANADIAN NINE
## Game Goes Thirteen Innings When Northerners Break Tie and Win by 5 to 4 
### Charles Prior, '23 
The thirteenth inning held its pro
verbial hard luck for the Cardinal
diamond artists and they lost a hard
fought contest with the Edmonton
Club of the Western Canadian League
by a score of E to 4, on the local field
Saturday afternoon. The game was
the kind which keeps the fans up on
their toes, although there were few
fans to keep that way. Draper heaved
the apple through the entire game and
uncorked the old medicine bag with
a vengeance. But one man found his
way to first on wild throws.

Apperson of the Canadians decided
to start things in the first, frame and
drove the apple through a hole in the
football bleachers for a home run.
There was nobody on the bases so his
fence-ball only netted one tally. Our
men remained calm and took the
count in one-two-three order. In the
second frame Herman clipped out a
single, Pillett hit out to Mitchell, and
Leake drove a clean one to center.
Things looked like another tally for
the Carucks but they failed to reckon
with Mort Kline's portside heave. He
pulled down the apple and whipped
it home with a perfect peg, catching
Herman off by a good two yards and
retiring the opposition for that frame.
The locals again took the count in
turn.
Stupin started the third off with
another hit —those Canucks sure
swung the fungo—and a sacrifice fol
lowed by a long fly to center gave
them another marker. Our men failed
to arouse themselves from their
lethargy. The fourth was quiet on
both sides. In the fifth the northern
ers failed to connect but Patterson
led off with a walk, and hits by Draper
and Mitchell gave us the first tally.

The Canadians opened fire again in
the sixth and two hits gave them a
run. With two in the tower against
the Cards, Carver got on by the catch
er's error and two hits by Patterson
and Bundy piled up . two more runs,
tying the score. The seventh was
quiet all around, and Draper retired
the visitors in quick succession in
the eighth, but in our period of the
frame Kline took a healthy wallop for
a three-bagger to left and a single by
Patterson chalked v up another run.
Manusli repeated Kline's performance
in the ninth and another run evened
the tallies again with for apiece. The
tenth and eleventh were quiet with
high tension registering on the nerv
ous systems. Mitchell got a hit in
the twelfth but died on the bases.

In the thirteenth Stupin led off with
a triple, and came home on a wild
throw by Mitchell. Carver drove a
clean one over second. Patterson fol
lowed with another. Carver was
caught off third by a short throw and
