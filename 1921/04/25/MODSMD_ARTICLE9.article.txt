# SENIOR NINE WINS TIGHT GAME FROM PROFESSORS
## Dr. Jordan and President Wilbur Open Battle; Hunger of Players Stops Melee; Final Score 10-6 
### William Evans, '22 
Seniors 10, Faculty 6. The foregoing
is the result of the annual Faculty-
Senior game held Friday 'afternoon in
the Faculty lot. The score miscues
the story of the struggle, a fight from
the first pitched ball to the seventh
inning, when the game was called by
the general craving for food and
fatigue of all hands. The game this
year was one of the best and closest
that have ever been played on the
local turf, interest being kept up to
the last minute by the startling de

cisions of the umpirfe, and stellar plays
of the outfields.
Ray Wilbur, '95, pitched the first
ball, bending a mean one over th«
rubber to the bewilderment of "Doc"
Jordan, the famous sphere cracker of
the Founders' League. On the second
one, however, "Doc" came back with
a neat single into the south lot, but
quick work on the part of the opposing
infield caught the substitute runner
before he gained the initial sack. This
retired the administration and the bat
tle was on. "Dink" Templeton took
the mound for the Faculty with "Doc"
Browne on the receiving end. Nef
opened the patting list for the '21-ers
and got on base. Red Ormsby follow
ed with a scratch and attained the
coveted possession of the first mile
stone. Swanholm banged out a little
one to the infield, and some neat work
on an attempted squeeze play by Duf
fy Seay resulted in the first two tallies
for the Seniors. Deems then took a
couple of lusty chances on the pill and
lost when a ball hit Browne in the
chest and bounced back over the plate
a perfect third strike. Browne led
off for the Faculty with a pop to third
and the next man followed suit, to the
bench. Then Duffy the Occidental
wonder came up with the sticq and
landed one safely in the left garden
lor a trip to first. "Dink" followed
with a liner through third and things
looked fine for a second, but a flyout
by Brown spilled the beans and re
tired the "profs."

At the opening of the second, Wood
ward got on through a slight miscalcu
lation of the center fielder in regard
to the lighting place of the former's
fly. Adams got on with a hit and
Woodward scored. Red Ormsby came
up again, vowing he'd knock the pill
down "Dink's" throat, but knocked
throe jagged holes in the ether in
stead. The next man drew a pass and
Deems forced Nef at third retiring the
side. Meairs made first, but three
outs in succession left him stranded
and put the Seniors back in the tim
ber district again.
The third was the eclipse for the
sombrerists, the near-grads going out
by the way of least resistance, uno,
duo, trayay. This frame began the
rally for the deacons. Brown grabbed |
a hold on the bases with a little hit
and Duffy came across with a neat
single into the right pasture, scoring
Browne. The effort was too much for
the valiant mentor, however, and he
was caught sleep-walking at the sec
ond post. Dink banged out a hot one
about six feet outside the foul line
over third, but a unanimous vote of
the rooting section and the umpire
awarded him a score after he had
circled the diamond. Doc Browne
drew a pass but in a wild dash for
second was thrown out.
Adams and Nef got on base through
errors at the start of the fourth.
Ormsby took the count for the third
time. Smith then came up and lifted
one into thesolar system for a clean
home run, raising the total of the Seni
ors by three. Deems drew a blank.
Powell, first man for the "profs" lined
out a wallop and made the hill to
first, but stage-fright put the remain
der out for the frame and left him
on base. Nef and Blood substituted
'as batteries for the Seniors in this
inning.
Neer fanned to make thinks look
well in the fifth. Rhinehold followed
j with what ought to have been an out,
but got to first. He tried to steal
j second and was voted out by the
| bleachers for his crust. Woodward
hoisted the pill into the far corner of
! the left lot when overexcitement caus
ed his downfall and Duffy threw him
out at second. Douglas opened for
; the faculty, with a 10-flat dash to
j first, -then stole second amid thundr
l ous applause from the sidelines, and
1 much mud from the field. Blood took
1 the count on the next ball when Duffy
failed to connect with it. Blood made
a perfect connection, however, with it
and his shin. Deems went back in
;at the home position. Duffy gained
j first base and Douglas advanced to
| third. Then came the stellar piece
!of inside baseball. Duffy made out to
j force Douglas in from third and Doug
lass ran down. Deems had the ball
at home. He took out after Douglas
as the latter turned back to third
The 10-flat wonder outdid him though
and coasted safely back to the third
station. A fan by Browne resulted
in Douglas' score. Duffy, always the
alert watcher, took advantage of a
balk to add another marker to the
score. Meairs and Powell both got to
first, and "Dink" came up with an
other two-bagger hid in the hickory
and scored Powell and Meairs. Duffy
fanned. The score was tied at 6-6.
Deems got to first in the sixth. Clas
sen took the bench road. Nef drove
one over second for a nice single, scor
ing Deems. Ormsby fanned. Smith
came up again and put another one
on the elevator for three bags, scor
ing Nef. Gillis rammed one into the
golfer farm in right field and stretched
it into a circuit, scoring Smith also.
Neer waved the wand and retired. This
left the faculty with a four run lead
to overcome. It was too much to ask.
Browne made the trip to first but the
next three got a whifT of the barbe
cued lambs and chose the food lino
instead of the baseline. The game
ended.
Summary—Batteries, faculty, "Dink"
Templeton, and "Doc" Browne and
Duffy Seay; seniors, Gillis and Nof,
and Deems and Blood. Strike-outs, by
Templeton, many, Gillis and Nef not
fio many, and Smith One. Injured
none. Time, just right. Referee,
Draper Line-ups: About twelve on
each side —maybe one or two more
cr less.

Seniors 10, Faculty 6. The foregoing
is the result of the annual Faculty-
Senior game held Friday 'afternoon in
the Faculty lot. The score miscues
the story of the struggle, a fight from
the first pitched ball to the seventh
inning, when the game was called by
the general craving for food and
fatigue of all hands. The game this
year was one of the best and closest
that have ever been played on the
local turf, interest being kept up to
the last minute by the startling de

cisions of the umpirfe, and stellar plays
of the outfields.
Ray Wilbur, '95, pitched the first
ball, bending a mean one over th«
rubber to the bewilderment of "Doc"
Jordan, the famous sphere cracker of
the Founders' League. On the second
one, however, "Doc" came back with
a neat single into the south lot, but
quick work on the part of the opposing
infield caught the substitute runner
before he gained the initial sack. This
retired the administration and the bat
tle was on. "Dink" Templeton took
the mound for the Faculty with "Doc"
Browne on the receiving end. Nef
opened the patting list for the '21-ers
and got on base. Red Ormsby follow
ed with a scratch and attained the
coveted possession of the first mile
stone. Swanholm banged out a little
one to the infield, and some neat work
on an attempted squeeze play by Duf
fy Seay resulted in the first two tallies
for the Seniors. Deems then took a
couple of lusty chances on the pill and
lost when a ball hit Browne in the
chest and bounced back over the plate
a perfect third strike. Browne led
off for the Faculty with a pop to third
and the next man followed suit, to the
bench. Then Duffy the Occidental
wonder came up with the sticq and
landed one safely in the left garden
lor a trip to first. "Dink" followed
with a liner through third and things
looked fine for a second, but a flyout
by Brown spilled the beans and re
tired the "profs."

At the opening of the second, Wood
ward got on through a slight miscalcu
lation of the center fielder in regard
to the lighting place of the former's
fly. Adams got on with a hit and
Woodward scored. Red Ormsby came
up again, vowing he'd knock the pill
down "Dink's" throat, but knocked
throe jagged holes in the ether in
stead. The next man drew a pass and
Deems forced Nef at third retiring the
side. Meairs made first, but three
outs in succession left him stranded
and put the Seniors back in the tim
ber district again.
The third was the eclipse for the
sombrerists, the near-grads going out
by the way of least resistance, uno,
duo, trayay. This frame began the
rally for the deacons. Brown grabbed |
a hold on the bases with a little hit
and Duffy came across with a neat
single into the right pasture, scoring
Browne. The effort was too much for
the valiant mentor, however, and he
was caught sleep-walking at the sec
ond post. Dink banged out a hot one
about six feet outside the foul line
over third, but a unanimous vote of
the rooting section and the umpire
awarded him a score after he had
circled the diamond. Doc Browne
drew a pass but in a wild dash for
second was thrown out.
Adams and Nef got on base through
errors at the start of the fourth.
Ormsby took the count for the third
time. Smith then came up and lifted
one into thesolar system for a clean
home run, raising the total of the Seni
ors by three. Deems drew a blank.
Powell, first man for the "profs" lined
out a wallop and made the hill to
first, but stage-fright put the remain
der out for the frame and left him
on base. Nef and Blood substituted
'as batteries for the Seniors in this
inning.
Neer fanned to make thinks look
well in the fifth. Rhinehold followed
j with what ought to have been an out,
but got to first. He tried to steal
j second and was voted out by the
| bleachers for his crust. Woodward
hoisted the pill into the far corner of
! the left lot when overexcitement caus
ed his downfall and Duffy threw him
out at second. Douglas opened for
; the faculty, with a 10-flat dash to
j first, -then stole second amid thundr
l ous applause from the sidelines, and
1 much mud from the field. Blood took
1 the count on the next ball when Duffy
failed to connect with it. Blood made
a perfect connection, however, with it
and his shin. Deems went back in
;at the home position. Duffy gained
j first base and Douglas advanced to
| third. Then came the stellar piece
!of inside baseball. Duffy made out to
j force Douglas in from third and Doug
lass ran down. Deems had the ball
at home. He took out after Douglas
as the latter turned back to third
The 10-flat wonder outdid him though
and coasted safely back to the third
station. A fan by Browne resulted
in Douglas' score. Duffy, always the
alert watcher, took advantage of a
balk to add another marker to the
score. Meairs and Powell both got to
first, and "Dink" came up with an
other two-bagger hid in the hickory
and scored Powell and Meairs. Duffy
fanned. The score was tied at 6-6.
Deems got to first in the sixth. Clas

; the faculty, with a 10-flat dash to
j first, -then stole second amid thundr
l ous applause from the sidelines, and
1 much mud from the field. Blood took
1 the count on the next ball when Duffy
failed to connect with it. Blood made
a perfect connection, however, with it
and his shin. Deems went back in
;at the home position. Duffy gained
j first base and Douglas advanced to
| third. Then came the stellar piece
!of inside baseball. Duffy made out to
j force Douglas in from third and Doug
lass ran down. Deems had the ball
at home. He took out after Douglas
as the latter turned back to third
The 10-flat wonder outdid him though
and coasted safely back to the third
station. A fan by Browne resulted
in Douglas' score. Duffy, always the
alert watcher, took advantage of a
balk to add another marker to the
score. Meairs and Powell both got to
first, and "Dink" came up with an
other two-bagger hid in the hickory
and scored Powell and Meairs. Duffy
fanned. The score was tied at 6-6.
Deems got to first in the sixth. Clas
sen took the bench road. Nef drove
one over second for a nice single, scor
ing Deems. Ormsby fanned. Smith
came up again and put another one
on the elevator for three bags, scor
ing Nef. Gillis rammed one into the
golfer farm in right field and stretched
it into a circuit, scoring Smith also.
Neer waved the wand and retired. This
left the faculty with a four run lead
to overcome. It was too much to ask.
Browne made the trip to first but the
next three got a whifT of the barbe
cued lambs and chose the food lino
instead of the baseline. The game
ended.
Summary—Batteries, faculty, "Dink"
Templeton, and "Doc" Browne and
Duffy Seay; seniors, Gillis and Nof,
and Deems and Blood. Strike-outs, by
Templeton, many, Gillis and Nef not
fio many, and Smith One. Injured
none. Time, just right. Referee,
Draper Line-ups: About twelve on
each side —maybe one or two more
cr less.
Seniors 10, Faculty 6. The foregoing
is the result of the annual Faculty-
Senior game held Friday 'afternoon in
the Faculty lot. The score miscues
the story of the struggle, a fight from
the first pitched ball to the seventh
inning, when the game was called by
the general craving for food and
fatigue of all hands. The game this
year was one of the best and closest
that have ever been played on the
local turf, interest being kept up to
the last minute by the startling de

cisions of the umpirfe, and stellar plays
of the outfields.
Ray Wilbur, '95, pitched the first
ball, bending a mean one over th«
rubber to the bewilderment of "Doc"
Jordan, the famous sphere cracker of
the Founders' League. On the second
one, however, "Doc" came back with
a neat single into the south lot, but
quick work on the part of the opposing
infield caught the substitute runner
before he gained the initial sack. This
retired the administration and the bat
tle was on. "Dink" Templeton took
the mound for the Faculty with "Doc"
Browne on the receiving end. Nef
opened the patting list for the '21-ers
and got on base. Red Ormsby follow
ed with a scratch and attained the
coveted possession of the first mile
stone. Swanholm banged out a little
one to the infield, and some neat work
on an attempted squeeze play by Duf
fy Seay resulted in the first two tallies
for the Seniors. Deems then took a
couple of lusty chances on the pill and
lost when a ball hit Browne in the
chest and bounced back over the plate
a perfect third strike. Browne led
off for the Faculty with a pop to third
and the next man followed suit, to the
bench. Then Duffy the Occidental
wonder came up with the sticq and
landed one safely in the left garden
lor a trip to first. "Dink" followed
with a liner through third and things
looked fine for a second, but a flyout
by Brown spilled the beans and re
tired the "profs."

At the opening of the second, Wood
ward got on through a slight miscalcu
lation of the center fielder in regard
to the lighting place of the former's
fly. Adams got on with a hit and
Woodward scored. Red Ormsby came
up again, vowing he'd knock the pill
down "Dink's" throat, but knocked
throe jagged holes in the ether in
stead. The next man drew a pass and
Deems forced Nef at third retiring the
side. Meairs made first, but three
outs in succession left him stranded
and put the Seniors back in the tim
ber district again.
The third was the eclipse for the
sombrerists, the near-grads going out
by the way of least resistance, uno,
duo, trayay. This frame began the
rally for the deacons. Brown grabbed |
a hold on the bases with a little hit
and Duffy came across with a neat
single into the right pasture, scoring
Browne. The effort was too much for
the valiant mentor, however, and he
was caught sleep-walking at the sec
ond post. Dink banged out a hot one
about six feet outside the foul line
over third, but a unanimous vote of
the rooting section and the umpire
awarded him a score after he had
circled the diamond. Doc Browne
drew a pass but in a wild dash for
second was thrown out.
Adams and Nef got on base through
errors at the start of the fourth.
Ormsby took the count for the third
time. Smith then came up and lifted
one into thesolar system for a clean
home run, raising the total of the Seni
ors by three. Deems drew a blank.
Powell, first man for the "profs" lined
out a wallop and made the hill to
first, but stage-fright put the remain
der out for the frame and left him
on base. Nef and Blood substituted
'as batteries for the Seniors in this
inning.
Neer fanned to make thinks look
well in the fifth. Rhinehold followed
j with what ought to have been an out,
but got to first. He tried to steal
j second and was voted out by the
| bleachers for his crust. Woodward
hoisted the pill into the far corner of
! the left lot when overexcitement caus
ed his downfall and Duffy threw him
out at second. Douglas opened for
; the faculty, with a 10-flat dash to
j first, -then stole second amid thundr
