# WRITING GAME IS SUBJECT OF TALK TONIGHT
## William Ellsworth, Former President of the Century Company, to Talk Tonight 
### 
William Webster Ellsworth will lec
ture on "The Writing Game" tonight in
the Little Theater at 7:30. Mr. Ells
worth was secretary of the Century
Company, publishers, for thirty-two
years, and was president of that firm
from 1913 to 1916, when he retired.
Since then he has devoted his time to
various lecture tours during which lie
has spoken at most of the larger uni
versities of the North and East. Mr.
Ellsworth's lectures deal with American
historical and literary topics. "Forty
Years of Publishing" is one of his popu
lar literary lectures and one which he
delivered at Stanford several years ago
on one of his visits to the campus.
"The Writing Game," Mr. Ellsworth's
latest lecture, will be his subject tonight.
It is mainly a study of writing in general
and is the result of a life-time spent
among writers and editors. Knowing
the ins and outs of the journalistic
world as he does, he will give his own
experiences and ideas on various phases
of writing. This lecture, as his former
ones, will be full of personal anecdotes
and of his encounters with popular
writers of today.
Mr. Ellsworth will discuss from all
side's the question of whether or not
authorship can be taught in a university.
In preparing this part of his lecture, he
sent out questionnaires to sixteen popu
lar short story writers, among whom are
Booth Tarkington, Edna Ferber, Fannie
Hurst, Mary Raymond Andrews Ship
man, and others, in which he asked their
opinions on this subject. He will quote
from the answers which he received
from them as they have aided him in
his conclusions about the matter. He
states in tliis lecture that Mark Twain,
Walt Whitman, and O. Henry would
probably have been injured rather than
helped by a college education, while
others, perhaps, could not have suc
ceeded without it.
In the last part of his talk, Mr. Ells
worth will discuss what journalism does
for authorship and whether or not it
helps it. He will take up points in writ
ing itself and will consider the problem
of the importance of characters over
plot, the secret of charm, and several
other phases of "the writing game."
