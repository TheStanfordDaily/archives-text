# WILBUR LECTURES 10 COSMOPOLITANS
## Declares That Social Problem Is Greatest Difficulty Now Confronting the University 
### 
Declaring that our present difficulty
is not with the intellectual side of the
University but with the social, the more
human, side. President Wilbur, in an
address before the Cosmopolitan Club
011 the Relation of Native to Foreign
Students at Stanford, said:
"The great problem of the University
is this—can we provide for the alien
student the same external surroundings
and the same opportunities for social
development that we provide in the
classrooms? The answer is, 'We can
not.' We cannot make over two or
three thousand students. It will take a
long time to eliminate these national and
racia! prejudices. Perhaps there will
come a millenium when everybody will
be given these extra-University privi
leges in exactly an equal proportion.
"If you make a distinction between the
university of a democracy of mind and
intellect and the other type of associa
tion, you will find that in America there
has been a constant struggle between
two general classes of students —the Tns
and the Outs. As a result no university
student body from a social standpoint is
united."
Increased facilities for transportation
and world knowledge brought into our
universities men from many races and
lands. Each one of them could usually
be distinguished because of his speech
and general appearance. He became a
marked personage. His racial and so
cial peculiarities interfered with his en
joymenf*t>f social privileges. The feel
ing against negroes and Indians has
been especially narked in American uni
versities.
President Wilbur recounted his ex
perience during a recent visit to the Uni
versity of Praguff which is composed of
German and Bohemian students. The
feeling between these two races is so
strong that a pitched battle was fought
in which three students were killed out
right.
He cited also the attitude of the uni
versities toward the admittance of wo
men. Several great universities are now
debating whether women shall be ad
mitted to the law and the medical
schools. The University of Pennsylvania
has just admitted women. "We are co
educational here at Stanford, largely be
cause Dr. Jordan wanted to be president
of that kind of nn institution. - It is just
a matter of chance. Otherwise we would
be a Yale or a Harvard."
The ideal of the University is "a com
mon meeting ground for all types of
mind, all cultures, all races, and both
sexes. The University can dissipate the
difference of race and nationality by
making the mind the primary tiling; by
makinr students feel that the .jjreat
thing is character, brains and the use of
the two in real service to humanity."

joymenf*t>f social privileges. The feel
ing against negroes and Indians has
been especially narked in American uni
versities.
President Wilbur recounted his ex
perience during a recent visit to the Uni
versity of Praguff which is composed of
German and Bohemian students. The
feeling between these two races is so
strong that a pitched battle was fought
in which three students were killed out
right.
He cited also the attitude of the uni
versities toward the admittance of wo
men. Several great universities are now
debating whether women shall be ad
mitted to the law and the medical
schools. The University of Pennsylvania
has just admitted women. "We are co
educational here at Stanford, largely be
cause Dr. Jordan wanted to be president
of that kind of nn institution. - It is just
a matter of chance. Otherwise we would
be a Yale or a Harvard."
The ideal of the University is "a com
mon meeting ground for all types of
mind, all cultures, all races, and both
sexes. The University can dissipate the
difference of race and nationality by
making the mind the primary tiling; by
makinr students feel that the .jjreat
thing is character, brains and the use of
the two in real service to humanity."
