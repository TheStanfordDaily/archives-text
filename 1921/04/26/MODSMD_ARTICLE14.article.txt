# ROOF GARDEN IS OPENER Of OPERA
## First Set Is That of Famous Frolic Pavilion; Technical Scenic Beauty Features 
### 
Staged in a roof garden, that of the
midnight frolic perhaps, is the pro
logue to the Junior Opera of this year
The setting is something the like of
which has never even been attempted
in this locality. The miniatures for
the drops and properties that will form
the back ground for the scene were
on the campuy last night, and they
show a blend of color schemes that
shames the efforts of past producers
in the light opera circles of the local
plays.
In this artistic setting, with lights
arranged to bring all the comple
mentary colors to the fore, will be
the opening part of the play. This
part will be quite separate and unique
in itself and is connected with the
rest of the plot in that it explains the
whole of the opera which follows. It
in no way detract from the spon
taneity of the play, but on the con
trary, is so closely integrated with the
successful working out of the plot that
it is absolutely indispensible. â€¢
The opening chorua of the opera
proper comes at the conclusion of the
prologue. "Simon," by name, the first
song treats of the designer of fashions
in the French Modiste Shop. He is
the great artiste, the designer of
fashions. His are the creations from
,the Boulevard Maurice. This act is
set in the shop of the Modiste Simon.
More extensive than in any other show
is the incidental decoration that will
go to make up the scenery on the
stage. Every bit of the hangings and
settings has been done on a small
scale and the stage will be made up
from this with the same attention to
detail that characterizes the great
sets of the moving pictures. Nothing
has been spared by the property force
to make all the scenes seem as real
istic as possible, and the effects that
have been attained are charming.
