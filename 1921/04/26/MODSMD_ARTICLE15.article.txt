# THETA XI DEFEATED BY PHI KAPPA SIGMA
## 
### 
Phi Kappa Sigma's intramural nine
planted a spot on the unblemished
record heretofore possessed by Theta
Xi, when an eighth inning rally netted
two runs making the final score of
13 to 11. The contest was one of the
best played so far by intramural ag
gregations and also one of the longest,
the shadows of night being predomi
nant at the finish. Swartz hurled the
apple for Phi Kappa Sigma with telling
effect, striking out twelve men in the
last six frames. The third inning was
Theta Xi's Waterloo. Their own er
rors plus a few husky wallops clouted
out by the opposing batsmen allowed
Jive free trips around the bags to the
liame plate. Just to make things more
interesting Reed found Swartz for a
home run in the next period. In the
seventh inning, Phi Kappa Sigma held
♦he long end of a 11 to 10 score when
Wentgart of the Theta Xi team step
ped into the batter's box. The afore
mentioned player swung through the
correct split-re and planted the white
ball far (nought away to make a com
plete circle of t?ie bases. This tally
evened the score and made an extra
frame necessary. With two down and
two on baset- for Phi Kappa Sigma,
Prather faced Classen and knocked out
a neat single which brought in two
runs. Theta Xi's last bats resulted in
a goose-egg. Batteries: Phi Kappa
Sigma, Hall and Swartz and Creig
low; Theta Xi, Classen and Smith.
No other official games were play
ed yesterday. Sigma Nu forfeited to
Federal Students; Encina 2 and 3 for
feited to Phi Delta Theta; Unattached
forfeited to ia Sigma Phi. Phi
Delta Theta, leader of league 2, chose
up sides and played a practice game.
