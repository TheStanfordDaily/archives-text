# WHAT ABOUT THE PRESENT PLAN?
## 
### 
Students who wish to nominate candidates for A. S. S. U. offices
should do so by means of a-speech to the students in the Assembly Hall,
say supporters of a constitutional provision that is 'put up for definite
repeal tomorrow.
An amendment was put before the students at the last election pro
viding for such an assembly. It was declared to have failed by the ex
ecutive committee, but the decision was appealed from on a technicality
and has not yet been definitely settled. To save the labor of continued
argument on the technicality a proposal to repeal the amendment if it
should be a part of the constitution is up for student decision tomorrow.
Why an Assembly?
Advocates assembly scheme of nomination deplore the pres
ent lack of interest in student politics, and believe that the assembly
method would revive interest. But if students lack interest in student of
fices, would the necessity of a speech on the part of one who wanted to
place a candidate before the students increase the interest? The present
student council tried out the plan of an assembly to nominate men for
membership, duly advertised it, and yet but a handful of students ap
peared to do the nominating. The scheme there was deemed a failure.
Do We Really Lack Interest?
But on the whole, is interest so woefully lacking in student politics?
True, men are sometimes elected on a white ballot, as tomorrow, when
the office to be filled is not particularly important because the term of
office is short. It is noticeable, too, that men who are elected on white
ballots arc usually of the particularly able type, on whom there seems to
he a general agreement as to capability" and worthiness of office, more
than a lack of interest in who is to take the position.
But on the whole interest in Stanford student offices seem§ better
than that of the average campus. We notice that when the student body
presidential election rolls around there is usually a pretty hot cdntest, as
last year, when over a thousand students voted, polling V greater aver
age vote than that of any community or reasonably large college in the
United States. We doubt if this interest could be improved by the
assembly method which is now used in certain western colleges which
do not turn out near the average Stanford vote.
Speaking for the Candidates
An assembly is more open and available for the use of the orator
or "line peddlar" who would have the opportunity of placing his own
powers of speaking before the audience more than the ability of his can
didate. Why place the nominating machinery in the hands of men who
like to talk? Our present system of normal and regular written nomi
nations is *nore in line with better present-day political methods, which
aim to get away from the mob and hurrah idea to just common-sense
nomination of a man because the nominator believes him best for student
body welfare. A candidate for student body office should run on what
he has done himself, and not on what some fluent speaker can say of
him in an open meeting. •' '
Finally,-whatever is said of StaTiford elections, they are usually free
from the wholesale "jxjlitics" charge that prevailsNn many colleges, the
most notable of which use the assembly nominating scheme. Stanford
student body elections are usually conducted by open-and-above-board
methods, and are usually clean and wholly free from suggestions of the
undesirable "political" tolerations.
The Daily believes, then, in the present nominating scheme because
with it we have had a greater average vote than most universities which
have the other plan, because good candidates are usually chosen, and be
cause it is more in line with plain, unassuming, common-sense nomina
tions, and has promoted a system of elections free from the undesirable
type of campaigning often found.
<$> <$><§>
INCIDENTALLY, a vote yes on proposition (2) tomorrow is a vote
for the present nominating plan and against the assembly scheme. The
first amendment is to clear up the situation of the number of votes re
quired to pass or defeat an amendment, and is for sake of clarity alone
and not a matter of principle. Tlie third is to strike out an obsolete
paragraph of the constitution. The Daily favors all three propositions
as stated for balloting tomorrow.

STUDENTS WHO HAVE any interest in or idea of following the

assembly method which is now used in certain western colleges which
do not turn out near the average Stanford vote.
Speaking for the Candidates
An assembly is more open and available for the use of the orator
or "line peddlar" who would have the opportunity of placing his own
powers of speaking before the audience more than the ability of his can
didate. Why place the nominating machinery in the hands of men who
like to talk? Our present system of normal and regular written nomi
nations is *nore in line with better present-day political methods, which
aim to get away from the mob and hurrah idea to just common-sense
nomination of a man because the nominator believes him best for student
body welfare. A candidate for student body office should run on what
he has done himself, and not on what some fluent speaker can say of
him in an open meeting. •' '
Finally,-whatever is said of StaTiford elections, they are usually free
from the wholesale "jxjlitics" charge that prevailsNn many colleges, the
most notable of which use the assembly nominating scheme. Stanford
student body elections are usually conducted by open-and-above-board
methods, and are usually clean and wholly free from suggestions of the
undesirable "political" tolerations.
The Daily believes, then, in the present nominating scheme because
with it we have had a greater average vote than most universities which
have the other plan, because good candidates are usually chosen, and be
cause it is more in line with plain, unassuming, common-sense nomina
tions, and has promoted a system of elections free from the undesirable
type of campaigning often found.

INCIDENTALLY, a vote yes on proposition (2) tomorrow is a vote

first amendment is to clear up the situation of the number of votes re
quired to pass or defeat an amendment, and is for sake of clarity alone
and not a matter of principle. Tlie third is to strike out an obsolete
paragraph of the constitution. The Daily favors all three propositions

STUDENTS WHO HAVE any interest in or idea of following the
"writing game" will be glad of the opportunity to hear Mr. Ellsworth,
formerly of the Century Publishing Company, lecture on that subject
tonight. Mr. Ellsworth's broad experience in the practical field, coupled
with a definite ability to present his views in an interesting manner,
should make his talk well worth the attention of the prospective journal
ist or writer.
Students who wish to nominate candidates for A. S. S. U. offices
should do so by means of a-speech to the students in the Assembly Hall,
say supporters of a constitutional provision that is 'put up for definite
repeal tomorrow.
An amendment was put before the students at the last election pro
viding for such an assembly. It was declared to have failed by the ex
ecutive committee, but the decision was appealed from on a technicality
and has not yet been definitely settled. To save the labor of continued
argument on the technicality a proposal to repeal the amendment if it
should be a part of the constitution is up for student decision tomorrow.
Why an Assembly?
Advocates assembly scheme of nomination deplore the pres
ent lack of interest in student politics, and believe that the assembly
method would revive interest. But if students lack interest in student of
fices, would the necessity of a speech on the part of one who wanted to
place a candidate before the students increase the interest? The present
student council tried out the plan of an assembly to nominate men for
membership, duly advertised it, and yet but a handful of students ap
peared to do the nominating. The scheme there was deemed a failure.
Do We Really Lack Interest?
But on the whole, is interest so woefully lacking in student politics?
True, men are sometimes elected on a white ballot, as tomorrow, when
the office to be filled is not particularly important because the term of
office is short. It is noticeable, too, that men who are elected on white
ballots arc usually of the particularly able type, on whom there seems to
he a general agreement as to capability" and worthiness of office, more
than a lack of interest in who is to take the position.
But on the whole interest in Stanford student offices seem§ better
than that of the average campus. We notice that when the student body
presidential election rolls around there is usually a pretty hot cdntest, as
last year, when over a thousand students voted, polling V greater aver
age vote than that of any community or reasonably large college in the
United States. We doubt if this interest could be improved by the
assembly method which is now used in certain western colleges which
do not turn out near the average Stanford vote.
