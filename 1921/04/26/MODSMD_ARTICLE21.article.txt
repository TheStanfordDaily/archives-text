Fairbanks Gets Foolish
Doug's latest picture, "The Nut,"
down at Stanford theater Is worth
seeing. It sdrags in spots, rather
sadly at times, but its bright moments
are enough to bring the total effect
up to a point where you won't regret?
your thirty cents and the trip to Pally,
opening scenes showing the Nut's
elaborate mechanical valet are a
scream.

A New Slant on the Village

Incidentally, Doug goes to Green
wich Village for his setting in this
latest effort. Gone are the fried onions,
free love, and bobbed hair and in their
place we have luxurious apartment
houses and Greenwich Village society.
There may be some society circles in
the residence districts which are en
croaching farther and farther down
into the Village or among the flabby
Bohemians who frequent Hotel Bre
voort and the Cafe Lafayette, but the
idea of "society" in that part of the
Village around Washington Square
South (abode of the famous Rose of
W. S.) and McDougal Alley struck us
as funny.

The Blossoms are out

The headline act at the Orpheum
up in the city shows unmistakable
signs of Spring and the perennial Blos
som is with us again. (The pun is in
tentional) Blossom Seeley will be re
membered by the readers of the Cab
bage column as the heroine of an un
fortunate matrimonial venture with
Rube Marquard, New York! Giants'
pitcher, whose 1914 record of nine
teen straight victories hasn't yet been
equaled. male assistants
are very clever and she still has lots
of pep even if her voice is a little
husky.
