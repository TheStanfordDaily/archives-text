We are the recipients today of sev
eral communications dealing with a
certain note found in the Library last
week. Owing to space limitations we
are compelled to cut down on them as
much as possible, if not more. There
follows excerpts from the most illumi
nating of the missives. .—

"Mr. Cabbage:—Honored Sir: —With
regard to your publication of last
evening, beg to remark that the ac
tion was most untimely. It is to me
nothing less than an insiduous at
tempt to alienate the affections of one
whom I bold in the highest regard.
Trusting this will knock you back to
whence you come, I remain—your
most obedient servant, L S."

"Mr. Cabbage Head, Person: —It has
come to my ears through certain
people who find time to peruse your
feeble attempt at a humor column,
that you have had the unblushing
temerity and brazen effrontery to pub
lish a certain note which it was my
misfortune to mislay in the Library.
I beg to inform you that your action
is without precedent. As to motive,
I see none. As to brains, it is evi
dent you have none. Are you capable
of chagrin? Permit me to remain your
most unwilling correspondent,
Violet Ink."

Cabbage, Say Guy:—l'm offa you till
Eskimos go barefooted. Honest, Cold
Slaw, you gotta crust The kid what
wrote that note comes from my home
town where they let humans write for
the papers. They oughta peel the skin
off your Adam's-apple, you big porker.
If you're lookin' for writin' material,
get yourself a mirror. There ain't
none better. Hopin' you die in the
can within a week, I remain yours till
I get you,—lma Ruff Kustomer."

To Whom it May Concern. Dear
Concern: —Your letter at hand. Will
soon be in the lyastebasket Other
contributions will follow suit. Kindly
confine your vituperations to oral ex
pressions. They look bad in print.
Your for the next drive on worms—
Cabbages.
