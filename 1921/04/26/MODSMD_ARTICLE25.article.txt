Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:—ln
answer to the viewpoint of last even
ing regarding the coming election, I
would like to explain the proposition
of the/Executive Committee on the
stand they have taken 011 the proposed
amendments. At the present time the
amending clause of the constitution
is ambiguous as to whether two-thirds
of the votes cast at an election are
necessary to adopt a proposed amend
ment, or whether two-thirds of those
voting 011 the proposal are sufficient.
The Executive Committee construed
the clause to mean two-thirds of those
voting at the election, believing that
in so doing they were carrying out the
intention of the constitution, and that
they were acting for the best interests
of the students. They felt that under
the rule advocated by the Nestoria
Debating Society, that if 1200 students
voted at election, and only 600 voted
011 a proposed amendment, then 400
votes could amend the constitution.
The other students who did not vote
would be considered as voting for it.
The Executive Committee felt that a
premium should not be placed 011 in
difference or ignorance and that the
constitution should not be changeable
at the hands of a handful of students;
but that two third?? of those voting at
the election would have to be con
vinced of the favorableness of the
proposal before it would%)ecome a part
of the constitution. As a result the
criticism In the editorial of the last
issue of the "Pictorial" that the consti
tution was changeable at the will of
a few voters, because of the indiffer
ence of the others, would not exist.
So the vote should be yes on the first
proposal.
y,'e feel as does Nestoria Debating
Society, that the will of the voters
should govern, and so the proposition
has been re-submitted to the voters
that they may express their will.
One of the purposes of re-submitting
these" proposed amendments was to
bring forth the arguments in their
favor, so that the students might de
cide why they should vote for or
against them. I feel that the students
should vote yes on the proposal to
repeal the nominating assembly plan.
First: Because the reason set forth
for its adoption, namely, that many
of the student body offices go unfilled
or are filled 011 a white ballot, does not
exist. The proposed nominating as
sembly is to apply only to the general
elections held in February and June.
Students do not have to rack their
memory very much to remember that
at the last February and June elec
tions and in fact at all the general
elections for the last four years, there
has always been the hottest compe
tition for the student body offices. The
cases where such offices were filled
on a white ballot were those where
the candidates nominated were gen
erally recognized as most fitted for
the positions sought. The unfilled and
white ballot offices were most numer
ous in the lesser important class of
fices, but this would not be remedied
by the nominating assembly, because
it does not apply to class officers, but
only to student body offices.
Secondly: Such a plan was in use
about the fifteenth century, and the
reasons for its repudiation are well
known to everyone. Some of the west
ern universities have tried it, and in
formation from, such £lac>es tells us
that it only increases bad feeling and
antagonism, and that politics are more
corrupt there than under the written
nominating plan now in use here. The
Stanford Student Body can well profit
by the experience of those places that
have tried the plan and found it bad,
and not try it to tlieir own loss. There
fore I believe that the students should
vote YES on these two proposals, for
such a vote on the first amendment
will clarify the constitution, and such
a vote on the nominating assembly is
a vote to repeal it if it is a part of
the constitution by the last election.
