Editor of Daily Palo Alto:
In view of the fact that several people
have asked me for the reason for pro
posing the following amendment to the
A. S. S. U. constitution: "That Article
111, Sections I, be stricken from the con
stitution," 1 am offering this explanation
through your columns.
The constitution as it now stands pro
vides that the Student Manager "shall
require an estimate of expenses from
the Women's Athletic Association and j
the Women's Conference at the begin
ning of each quarter and shall be pre
pared to expend for their purpose, if
required, at least 75 per cent of the re
ceipts from association dues collected
from women members. He shall have
charge of all expenditures of these or
ganizations and cooperate with the
Women's Athletic Board in such ways i
as the latter may desire."
The above provision is no longer in
harmony with conditions as they now
exist, and for that reason I have pro
posed the amendment which is to be
voted on Wednesday. For the past two
years this sectioN has not been in opera
tion due to the fact that the University
has turned over to the Worricn's Athletic
Association fifty cents from each
men Students Association dues, and to
the Organized Women twenty-five cents
from each Women Students Association
dues. All expenses of the Organized
Women are met by these two funds,
which are administered by the women
themselves, through officials appointed
by them. Since none of this money
comes under the control of the student
manager, and as the student body is in
no way liable for the debts incurred by
the women, he obviously can not have
charge of their expenditures, and
Article 111, Section 2 of the constitution
is, as a result, null and void in effect;
there is no point in maintaining in the
constitution a provision which, practi
cally speaking, is dead."* Consequently,
Article 111, Section 2, should be stricken
from the constitution, which it will he if
the amendment is passed.
ANNE HARDY.
