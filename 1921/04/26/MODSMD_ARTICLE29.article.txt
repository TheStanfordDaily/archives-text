# Snake Loses His Rattle; Hall Visited
## 
### 
Great Snakes! Full many a worthy
queener has desired to be listed as such,
but the petrified omelet is awarded with
out hesitation to the courageous genl
who aspired to escort his lady fair about
the revered halls of Encina in a rheu
matic gasoline mechanism. Full measure
of grief was meted out to the hardy in
truder.
When the treacherous conveyance
stopped suddenly, as is the wont of its
tribe, in front of the magnificent edifice,
the dwellers of the adjacent grottoes
were touched with pity at the sad plight.
A desire to raise the lowly beast of bur
den from its humble station was born
in the minds of all. Forthwith the com
rades in mercy escorted the disabled
chariot, with all due reverence, into the
heights of their domicile, even unto the
fourth floor. The charitable act so
touched the recipient that it was con
strained to weep, after its peculiar fash
ion, and a rain of iron objects de
scended upon the sacred linoleum.
After a joyful stay among the dwell
ers of the glorious heights, the visitor
was brought to the surface again, a
changed Maxwell.
