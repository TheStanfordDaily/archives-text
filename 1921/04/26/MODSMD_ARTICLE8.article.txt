# O. A. Seas Ain't the Only One 'ats Wet Amid Sahara Sands

### 
Shades of the Nile! Open Sesame
and see what we have here. Eight
count 'em, eight. Don't crowd people.
The admission is a dime, the tenth
part of a dollah. Eight little bits of
tinted terpsichorean translations
tripping to tantalizing tunes. Gaily
garbed geisha girls gaining great gobs
doing daintily dances deliriously di
rected. Basements in the four-sided
cones of the Ptolemies. Who would
have thought of the foresightedness
of the ancient inhabitants of the lazy
sands where the warm waters of the
Red Sea caress the shifting dunes of
the Sahara Yet there can be no
doubt about it for there have been
found not so long ago, "Cellars in a
Pyramid." Left as a heritage of Cleo
patra to the, parched people, they exist
as shown in the song of the Junior
Opera ponies.
"How dry I am"! sing the little
ladies, slipping a scintillating stagger,
and the deed is done. The effect is
irresistible. This is only one of the
eighteen songs that feature the opera
this year, an opera that surpasses
anything that has ever been attempt
ed here. All the critics admit it.
Honest they do. The song, "Cellars
in a Pyramid," is the composition of
Augusta Corey, '23, as are also the
words.
