# SPEAKERS FAVOR CAMPAIGN FOR MOOD FUND
## Chancellor States That the Orient's Hope for Advancement Lies in American Aid 
### 
I>r. Jordan, Floyd McElroy, '21, and
Paul Erickson, '21, last night addressed
the Lockwood Fund workers, empha
sizing the fact that it is such men as
Lockwood who are the only hope of
the Orient. As a result the thermo
meter outside the Union, which is re
cording the progress of the drive reads
$260 the amount which was subscribed
at the meeting and previously by the
workers.
Dr. Jordan stated that the adoption
of American idealism is the only
chance of the eastern nations to pro
gress. The course of militarism such
as is the curse of Europe and the
policy offered by antimilitaristic
America are the only two open to the
millions in China and the other non-
Christian countries of the East. Dr.
'Jordan said also that he knew the
work of and his colleagues
and knew it to be the one force which
is effective in checking any militaristic
tendency. He expressed pride that
Stanford is taking its place up in the
foremost ranks of American univer
sities in this work.
McElroy emphasized the importance
of making a comparatively good show
ing with California, which recently
raised $5710 for this purpose. A smal
ler sum is necessary to .average the
same amount per student here by the
total should be well over $1000. Erick
son remarked the opportunity for ex
pression of wider interest in this
drive. Many come to college and are
promptly lost sight of, only an ear or
two being visible for identification,
so buried are they in books. Such
people are likely to leave college much
narrower than they entered it, he
pointed out. and in such work as this
they will find the broader interests
which will carry them''over. '
The drive committee has requested
that reports be made as soon as pos
sible to the Y. M. C. A. offices ;n order
that the thermometer may kept on
the up. The pledges and cash should
be brought in at the time thi/ report
is made, that is any time between
8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
The pledges are in the hands of the
solicitors now and they have been
instructed to disregard the "May 10th
date for final payment in the wise of
larger contributions than the ordinary,
allowing the giver to see his own time
for payment. The drive started in
earnest today with the speeches of
representatives in the eating clubs and
fraternities which will be followed up
by more intensive canvassing later.
