# INTERCLASS WATER POLO BEGINS TODAY
## 
### 
Interclass water polo starts off this
afternoon as the juniors meet the fresh
men. The series has been arranged so
that each class team will play every
other class team, the winner being the
one who finishes the series with the i
highest average.
The juniors have an exceptionally
strong team, four varsity men being on
their squad. Strauss, Stern, Welch and
Thomas are players who will cause the
opposing classes much trouble. The
freshmen, while not seeming quite so
strong, have a powerful-looking team.
Miller, Cross, Greppin, Schmieder,
Hooper, Lane, and Fullerton are the
likely choices for the line-up. Several of
the best freshman players are those who
have not been eligible to compete in out
side contests because of probation, so
the series of games should bring out
many new points not hitherto noticed.
Thursday it is planned to have two
more games played, probably between
the sophomores and freshmen, and
juniors and seniors, although the sched-
I tile has not been definitely fixed as yet.
