# Big High School Meet At Berkeley April 30
## 
### 
The oval at Berkeley will be the scene
of the annual struggle for the track and
field supremacy of the state, when over
2(X) high school athletes come together
in their biggest meet of the year next
Saturday. High schools representing
every section of the state are entered,
and, according to the records already
made, there will be plenty of competition
in every event.
This meet, held once a year, affords
the only basis of comparison between
athletes of the northern and' southern
parts of California and gives to the uni
versities some indication of the next
year's freshman material. As only the
point winters in the sectional meets are
allowed to compete, times and distances
equaling those of an intercollegiate meet
arc made.
