# LITERARY WORK IS SUBJECT OF W. W. ELLSWORTH
## Value of College Education Determined Entirely By Individual Says Speaker 
### 
Speaking from his broad experience
gained in thirty-five years' work with
the Century Publishing Company, as sec
retary and president, William Webster
Ellsworth delivered a lecture on the
"Writing Game" last night in the Little
Theater-
There is a game that everyone wants
to play hut in which only a few succeed—
the writing game," said Ellsworth. He
then proceeded to give an account of all
phases of this game. There are 1897
authors of prominence in America, and
Ellsworth knows about balf' of them by
name and reputation. • .
In connection with the value ',of at
college education as a preparation for
authorship he said most of the. authors
of the day are about evenly divided on
the quetsion. Out of a list'<Vf fifty-one
American authors who have "wotl 1 fame,
twenty-eight went to college. This list
was compiled some time ago anjl now
the showing in favor of the colleges
would be a little better. In England
college writers predominate.
"A college eduaction would hav<r in
jured such writers as Mark. Twain,
Walt Whitman, and O. Henry,; their
style would have suffered as a result of
j college training." lie went on say, how
ever, that undoubtedly many author's had
been helped and started on their careers
through college.
. The actual teaching of writing in rol
leges or any place else is a point of dis
pute among authors, according to Ells
worth. Many of them uph6td the col
lege for the education it gives -otherwise
than in the actual writing of-stories. In
this connection Mary Roberts, Rinehart
says that the ojily way to write is to
write.
The methods of aiitHo'rs' iii the de
velopment of a story or novel 'Catm? in
for their share of the discu?siort. Differ
ent authors use different methods,.i/i,the
writing of their books, said Ellsworth.
Booth Tarkington starts with his char
acters and jets the plot' deVefop as it
goes along, while Robert Louis Steven
son usually controlled his characters by
the plot. Mary Roberts Rinehart says
the story every time, while Fannie Hurst
gets her characters first and develops the
story from them.
It is Ellsworth's opinion that journal
ism is the profession which leads most
directly into authorship, but care should
be taken to avoid absorbing too much of
the journalistic style. He was surprised
to find the number of authors who had
been developed from the law; however,
journalism maintains the lead.
In regard to the sale of stories, Ells
worth said that the sale of one story to a
high-class magazine was worth twenty
in magazines of a lower order. He
classed the Atlantic Monthly, Harpers.
Scribners, and the Century as heading
the list, with the others following in
different ranks.
"A manuscript must awaken enough
interest to hold the reader," concluded
Ellsworth. "If you want to write, write,
but if you find that this gift of the gods
is not yours, quit."
