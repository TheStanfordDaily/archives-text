# "THE FARM" AND SPRING

Now that the first real spring days are with us, Professor Dense
is wondering why so mauy excellent students are bothered with head
aches. Instructor Livewire looks understandingly over the morning's
abseirt marks and out the window into the first warm sunshine, regret
ting that his academic position sharply prevents his own free answer to
the call of the hills, highway, lake, or general spring laziness.
The warm days have been a long, time in coming, and for that rea
son students tend to take more advantage of them. And this is as
it should be, for the student who has not climbed the hills back of the
Quad to view the campus, Santa Clara Valley, and even Campanile on
a clear day, has missed a worthwhile part of Stanford. And we agree
with the man who not long ago suggested that any one who did not
enjoy canoeing on Lagunita, the right kind of canoeing, ought to be
put to sea in a ship of lead.
But with all this we come back, sometimes rather abruptly, to the
realiz-ation that we are Stanford students, and that Professors Dense
and Livewire both are making regular entries in the little classbooks
they keep.
