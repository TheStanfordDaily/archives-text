# STANFORD "DAYS"
## 
### 
In the University callendar of the next two weeks two days have
beea set aside for important student activities. Rach has a very pro
nounced all-university purpose. Labor day is practically the only stu
dent-body activity promoted primarily for direct benefit of deserving
persons. Along with this it is an all-university entertainment.
On Alumni Day students arc expected to demonstrate to our for
mer graduates the plant as it now functions, to acquaint them with th£
progress of Stanford.
Competent committees have charge of the plans for the two days.
But successful activity on the two occasions depends on the response
met by,these committees in dealing with students. Every student in
terested in the welfare of Stanford may aid by talking of and adver
tising the importance of the two days, by co-operation with the com
mittees in their requests and by offering suggestions for the improve
ment of the program of either day.

largely in charg<*of our foreign affairs, the Los Angeles Times thinks
we can hardly be accused of being English, certainly not of dropping
our H's.

SINCE OSCAR TSCHIRKY, former chef, signed his recent ten-year
contract with the Waldorf Astoria, making him maitre d' hotel at a fee
said to involve almost $500,000 the Palo Alto Ti>»es wonders if aft
American boys will still aim to be presidents.
