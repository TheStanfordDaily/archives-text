We issue fair warning that this
column publishes none but bona-fide
notes. Yesterday, we were swamped
with callers, presenting notes sup
posedly-picked up in the Library and
fclsewhere, who desired that their con
tributions be given an airing. They
got one--but it was the air.

There was one addressed to "D.M.8."
from "one of your feminine admirers"
among the many contributions. Don't
know how they get that way, but this ;
one got. If it was reaV, we're offa the j
poorer fifth till death do us p>art.

here's some more on that first one.
"Cabbages and Things, Mr. Things—<
Permit me to take this opportunity of

I've played the fool full many a time,
To woman serene and woman sublime,
Who, with smiling eyes and taunting

Steals both hearts and poker chips.
I act the fool hut on the Quad,

Forget about technique and art,
At home I play, the husband's part.

We issue fair warning that this
column publishes none but bona-fide
notes. Yesterday, we were swamped
with callers, presenting notes sup
posedly-picked up in the Library and
fclsewhere, who desired that their con
tributions be given an airing. They
got one--but it was the air.

There was one addressed to "D.M.8."

I've played the fool full many a time,
To woman serene and woman sublime,
Who, with smiling eyes and taunting

Forget about technique and art,
At home I play, the husband's part.
