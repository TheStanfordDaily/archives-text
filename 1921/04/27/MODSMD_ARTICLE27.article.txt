# STANFORD MUSIC CLUB PRESENTS PROGRAM
## 
### 
A small but appreciative audience was
present to hear the recital of the Stan
ford Music Club in the Women's Club
house last evening. The program opened
with a light Prelude by MacDowell
played by Richard Malaby, '23. Tiiis se
lection was in definite contrast to the
more staid rhythm of Lechetiszky's
"Tarentelle" which followed. Ruth
Davis, '21. sang two selections which
gave opportunity for wide range of pitch
in the voice, "I Hear a Thrush at Eve"
by Cadman, and "'Twas April" by
Nevin. The encore was a composition
by Clarke, "Someday, Sometime."
Bernice Frankenheimer, '20, played
three familiar compositions by Debussey,
Kricsler, and Sibelius. Darl Mac√üoyle,
'21, baritone, sang the Flute Song by
Elotson, and the Indian Love Song by
Amy Wood-Forde Finden, for his more
finely artistic selections, and ended with
the humorous popular British Sea Song.
Donuel Hillis, '21, closed the program
with a Liszt work, Twelfth Rhapsodie,
and answered the encore with Pasquale's
"Romance."
