# FOURTEEN DANCES MAKE UP PROGRAM FOR JUNIOR PROM
## 
### 
Fourteen dance* instead of twelve
will be the program of the Junior
Prom this season. The dance will
start at 8:45 and end at 1 a.m. It
is the plan of the committee to start
the dance promptly at the time
named, and they hope that all the
couples will be there on time. The
eighth dance will be a waltz and all
the rest will be fox trots. There are
to be no extras unless there appears
a superfluity of time % to spare during
the evening.
The supper dance will be off the pro
gram and will come about 11:30. Dur
ing the supper there will bo enter
tainment furnished by Nathanson and
Jack Heflernan, and other campus tal
ent. The music is a ten piece or
chestra directed by Ambrose Whit
mer. It is built around the orchestra
that played for the Sophomore Co
tillion, but is augmented by the ad
dition of new members that make the
best aggregation of melody purveyors
that have appeared on the campus in
a long time.
