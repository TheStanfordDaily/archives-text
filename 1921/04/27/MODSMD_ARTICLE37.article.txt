# MAYA-AZTEC ARTS WILL BE THEME OF GALLERY EXHIBIT
## 
### 
An exhibition of Maya-Aztec and
Applied Arts will be held at the Stan
ford Art Gallery, from May 1 to May
29. This collection consists mainly
of the works of Francisco Cornejo, the
Mexican artist.
The Maya, Toltec, Zepotec and
Aztec are the early tribes of Mexicon
aborigines from whose works Mr.
Cornejo has received inspiration. The
chief characteristics of the pre-his
toric age were i the expressions of
"sheer beauty," "decorative, charac
ter" and the lack of impressions of
European contact.
In tli words of this artist, "the con
struction of their palaces and temples
was based on the simplest forms, em
bellished with truly classical orna
ments, unsurpassed by any other na
tion. I can not help but feel that it
is the duty of the artist to revive the
old traditions of young America."
Mr. Cornejo is the founder of the
Aztec Studio in San Francisco. It is
here that he and his pupils have de
picted memoirs of the art exhibition
which is coming to the campus next
week, and will be first displayed at 3
o'clock Sunday afternoon. Two speak
ers will accompany exhibit. One
is an author, who will disclose facts
concerning legends of the Maya-Aztec
whose cities have sunk into oblivion,
whose names are shadows, and, as Mr.
Lemos, Curator of the Museum, stated,
"whose civilization is told to us largely
by their art that has remained."
Mr. Lemos has also announced that
etchings and prints made in Mexico
by Helen Hyde, Gustave Baumann and
Caldweller Waßhburn, are to occupy
one of the smaller rooms at the Gal
lery at the same time.
