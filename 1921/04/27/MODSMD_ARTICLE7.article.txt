# TENNIS DANCE WILL HELP RAISE FUNDS FOR EASTERN TRIP
## 
### 
Saturday, April 30th, is the date set
for the annual tennis hall to be held at
the Women's Clubhouse for the pur
pose of raising funds to send the Stan
ford tennis team east. From all indi
cations the "hop" will be one of the
best affairs of the spring quarter, whis
pering of coy decorations and keen
music, furnished by Ambrose Whitmer
and his hand of jazz artists.
The most interesting feature of the
dance is the gate tax of one "lone seed,"
or less than it would take to "spread" a
party at the movies for two. Originally
the tennis ball was to be a huge spring
time fantasy on the order of the junior
prom, where sedate damsel? and their
escorts would disport themselves in the
garb of the tennis court. That was the
old-time court ball. But, as the game of
tennis lias changed to be one of the
popular in all walks of life, the
spirits that guide the destinies of the
graduate manager's office thought it
opportune to make the dance one of the
best of the year and easily accessible to
every one.
Funds from the tennis ball will help to
send a pair of Stanford's racqueters to
invade the courts of nearly twenty col
leges and participate in one of the
largest schemes of Cardinal expansion
in the East ever attempted in tennis
circles From the showing of Jim Davies
in winning the open singles champion
ship at Ojai Valley, Stanford could be
considered a dangerous contender for
tlie national intercollegiate champion
ships to be held at Ilaverford, Pa.,
where the standard of tennis play is no
stronger than at the Ojai meet.
