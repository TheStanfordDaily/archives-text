### 
Foreman Paul Campbell has , de
vised a plan for dividing the work to
be done about the Children's Conva
lescent Home on Labor Day, next
Tuesday. The workers will be divided
into gangs, each in charge of a gang
boss, and a separate duty will be as
signed to every gang. Among the
activities will be the cleaning up of
the old Stanford family orchards,
felling trees, hoeing the grass around
the Home, taking away the rubbish,
etc. The trees to be cut will be split
up into firewood for the use of the
Home.
Arrangements for six hundred tools
have been made with the corporation
yard. Hoes, rakes, picks, shovels,
saws, and axes are included in the
list of implements. Chairman Fred
Adams emphasized the point that all
these tools must be returned to the
corporation ward, and a truck has been
provided for that purpose.
Two trucks have been obtained from
the Military Department, together
with several wagons from the corpora
tion yard, by Guy Draper, in charge
of this feature. A number of wheel
barrows are to be provided. It is
planned to dump the rubbish into San
Franciscquito gulch.
