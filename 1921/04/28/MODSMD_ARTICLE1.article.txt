# WATER SUPPLY IS SUBJECT OF TALK IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## M. M. O'Shaugnessy, City Engineer of San Francisco, Tells of Success of Project 
### 
San Francisco's plans for supplying a
large city with a water supply that shall
be adequate for many years to come
were depicted last night in the Assembly
Hall by M. M. O'Shaugnessy, city en
gineer of San Francisco. Tn his talk he
gave pertinent facts and figures, and
this was supplemented by three reels of
moving pictures showing graphically the
actual operation of the development.
When the Hetch-Hetchv water system
is finally completed there will be a four
hundred million gallon stream of water
flowing into San Francisco daily, which
will be enough to supply a city of four
million inhabitants. Besides thus se
curing a large reserve for urban use.
there will be plenty of water left over
for irrigation purposes such as are car
ried on at Madera and other San Joa :
quin cities.
Mr. 'O'Shaugnessy spoke of the long
struggle to obtain the right to develop
the Hetch-Hetchy lands, which, although
in Yosemite Park, are 20 miles away
from the valley proper. The first nego
tiation with the government was opened
in 1901, and by 1914 the way was cleared.
He also mentioned the political situation
in San Francisco, where three elections
have been held to vote the bonds neces
sary to purchase the Spring Valley pip
ing system so that no duplication will be
necessary. In ea<4i case the proposition
was defeated. Mr. O'Shaugnessy said
he believed the main trouble was that
70.000 commuters in San Francisco were
difficult to reach and may have pre
vented the carrying of the bond issues.
Work has begun on the big dam at
Hetch-Hetchy. It will first be raised to
a height of 226 feet, and when com- ,
pleted will be 312 feet high. The Lake
Fleanor dam has already been com
pleted.
The lecture was well attended, and the
audience was general rather than merely
an engineering gathering. The address
was held under the auspices of the En
gineering Council, and the speaker was
introduced by Lyman Wilbur, president
of the council.
