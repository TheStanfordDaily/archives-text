# SIX SAXAPHONES ADDED TO OPERA
## Syncopation Sextet Will Be Special Attraction; Music Written by Myron Higby 
### 
Six scarlet suited saxaphonists sighing
slowly sweet southern syncopations. This
is one of the specialty acts that feature
the opera this year. The six best saxa
phonists on the campus have been ob
tained and are working up a sextet that
bids fair to surpass anything ever heard
on the coast. Special music has been
written by Myron Higby, '22, for the
sextet, and it is of the kind that will fit
in particularly well with the opera.
Costumes for the players have been
obtained from a popular costumer in San
Francisco, and will be an added attrac
tion to the jazz program. The suits are
of scarlet satin, the same as those worn
by the noted musicians of the "Mid
night Frolic," in New York. The music
will be effectively introduced in one of
the tableau scenes of the opera.
Fashion Parade Is Feature (blackface)
Another of the feature acts of the
show this season is the fashion parade of
the beauty chorus. Livingstone's, of San
Francisco, have consented to allow some
of their most beautiful creations to be
shown down here as a part of the pro
gram, and a complete line of gowns will
be exhibited. They will include every
thing from the latest style in sport and
yachting clothes to lovely evening gowns.
