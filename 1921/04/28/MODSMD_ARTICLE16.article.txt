# NEW WRITING SYSTEM INVENTED BY ALUMNUS
## 
### 
Frank A. Scofield, '13, formerly in
structor in secretarial training at
Stanford, has invented a system of
writing known as "brief-hand," which
he claims will enable a person to
write at twice his ordinary speed.
In his position'' here and in his later
experience with business concerns,
Scofield felt the need for a simple
system which would enable business
men and students to write rapidly. He
finally worked out "brief-hand," a
system of rapid writing based on long
hand characters, which he has patent
ed and issued in pamphlet form.
Brief-hand, according to Scofield, has
none of the complexity of shorthand,
and, although it performs to a large
extent the functions of the latter, can
be learned in a very short time. With
a small amount of practice it can be
read as easily as long-hand, says the
inventor, and is therefore especially
adapted to students' use.
Scofield, since his graduation, has
been connected with the secretarial
departments of various corporations
in administrative capacities, among
them the Associated Oil Company and
the Standard Oil Corporation School.
Several copies of his system are on
display at the Bookstore.
