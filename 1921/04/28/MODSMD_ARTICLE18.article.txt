# HUSTON OUTLINES PLACE OF LAWYER IN COMMONWEALTH
## Dean Emphasizes Need For Trained Experts in Every Line of the Profession 
### 
The position of the lawyer as a per
sonal advisor and counsellor, rather
than as an advocate at court, was
emphasized by Dean C. A. Huston in
Jiis talk on the "Place of the lawyer
in the Commonwealth" in the Little
Theater last night.
The chief business of the lawyer,
jn the opinion of Dean Huston, is to
keep his client out of court, anil
especially in complex business trans
actions and organizations is his advice
indispensable. In advising men as to
their rights and powers the lawyer
plays an important part in the busi
ness world.
"But when man gets in court," eon
4inued Dean Huston, "the procedure
is a science in itself, and a lawyer is
needed to guide the litigent, who has
hitherto given no thought to the mat
ter. In the mass .of details and rules
lhe .assistance >of an expert is essential.
tEven if the were simpl
ified as much as possible, the layman
could do practically nothing.
"The lawyer is looked to for po
litical as well as professional ser
vices. To know how to reform is to
know what the letter of the law is,
together with its history and present
practice. Politics, however, should be
the avocation of the lawyer, rather
than his vocation."
Dean Huston traced the connection
between the commonwealth and the
law, showing how the chief end of the
former was the common welfare. This
is obtainable, he said, through the ad
ministration of justice which, in turn,
is secured by a system of law. The
law, in general, consists of certain
rules, principles, and judicially de
fined standard of conduct, and the
justice which it administers should be
cheap, accessible, and swift, in order
that it be afforded to the poor.
To be a good lawyer, concluded
Dean Huston, one should know the
rules and results .of other sciences,
so that he may know iWben the prece
dents fail. "Teamwork between the
sciences" is one of the things lawyers
ought to learn to play in.
