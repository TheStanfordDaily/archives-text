# A
						MORE ABLE COUNCIL
## 
### 
At the end of the year the terms of all members of the Men's Coun
cil expire. I'ive new members will be selected to take their i>ositions
and assume the responsibility for the success of student control. Yet
they will be wholly unfamiliar with business conducted by the present
body, the problems it has met and the procedure in solving them. There
will be little precedent to guide them, and there will be none among
their number able to explain the circumstances and contingencies sur
rounding the establishment of the little precedent they have. No one
will be able to show the reasoning and methods of the present council
in meeting the difficulties of this year.
In other words, the experience and lessons of the past will be of
little benefit to the council members of next year as there is no way of
transferring the knowledge and grasp of student problems gained by
members of one council over to those who take up the duties for the
following period. The men chosen in June will constitute a new court,
beginners in the field of student control.
It seems that the problem thus set before men of the council at the
beginning of each year is unnecessarily harsh. They should be able to
handle student affairs more capably with knowledge and understanding
of the problems and settlements of bodies preceding them.
By the present scheme five senior members of the Student Council
are elected in June to hold office for the following year, at the end of
which their work abruptly terminates and five new members are chosen.
Jf possible, would it be wise to elect three senior members in June for a
one-year term. Elect two juniors at the February balloting to serve
until the following February.
The junior members would then serve during the latter half of their
junior year with three senior members. 'Then duing the first of their
senior year, after three new men take office, they would be experienced
members of the council and should carry with them all that goes with a
knowledge of the methods and problems of the council. The body at
the beginning of the year would not be wholly in the dark as to how pre
vious councils functioned, nor as to their reasons for acting as they did
in eases that may reopen or come before them as precedent.
A simple amendment to the constitution next June might aid the
future councils materially in keeping the helm of student control.

WE ARE GLAD TO NOTE that continued reports from the Ojai tour
nament indicate that the conduct and sportsmanship of the Stanford en
trants won for then* the almost undivided "neutral" support of the tour
nament crowds. 1 We notice also that the game of the Cardinal net men is
improving and that the Coast Conference and eastern meets may find
them more than runner-up contenders.
