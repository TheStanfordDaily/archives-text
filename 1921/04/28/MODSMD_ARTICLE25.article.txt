# Edith Ronald Mirrielees Possesses Understanding Of Undergraduate Viewpoint
## 
### 
Stanford student, instructor, and au
thor, Edith Ronald Mirrielees is one of
that hand of Stanford alumni whose
work attests the loyalty of graduates to
their alma mater. Her four years as a
student have given her, through the
vantage point of a teacher, an under
standing of the viewpoint of the Stan
ford undergraduate. As an instructor
in the English Department she can now
develop in her students the best of
Stanford traditions, ideals, and aims.
Having followed up the literary life
which she* found to be her field while in
college, Miss Mirrielees has not only
been granted a place in the Stanford
faculty but a place in American litera
ture as one of the foremost short story
writers of the twentieth century. Those
who have read her stories in the At
lantic Monthly, the American Magazine,
or the Sunset, .can appreciate a comment
on the originality of he style, composed
of sparkling humor, the intensity of
pathos, and always an underlying cur
rent of deep intellectual ability govern
ing plot and technical expression.
"Home" for Miss Mirrielees is found
in a small town with a large nameâ€”
"Big Timber," Montana. There, as a

girl, she acquired her preliminary train
ing, though unconsciously, for the
thoughts which she pictures into words
today. The outdoor life in the wild
forest section of Montana instilled a
thorough knowledge of nature in the
mind of the writer. Having completed
all the preparatory work which her town
could offer, Miss Mirrielees came to
Stanford and entered as a member of
the class of '07. This was the beginning
of four years of exceedingly active col
lege life. Her clever style of writing
was soon noticed and, after some jour
nalistic experience, she was made editor
of the "Sequoia," as the "Cardinal" was
then called. The Sequoia was a student
body publication at that time and served
as a true representation of the literary
culture within the University. Interest
in campus documents did not stop here
as tin' brilliant humorist was called upon
to edit the Women's Edition of the
Chaparral. She entered into this work
with such /.est aiul obtained such fine
results that she was soon placed on the
Quad board. Her journalistic enter
prises were accompanied by work on
numerous dramatic committees and
committees on student affairs. Perhaps
the most influential piece of work she
accomplished in this regard was the po
sition she took in the founding of the
women's honorary society of Cap and
down. Edith Mirrielees, with Mary
Hazel Pedlar and Alice Sedouie Hayes,
founded this organization with the idea
of bringing together the women most ex
tensively engaged in campus activities
in order to promote friendship instead
of rivalry among them and to develop
an understanding of all fields in which
ftcti\e work could take place. To prove
to students and faculty the sincerity of
their purpose, the three women launched
a drive for a fund to provide Stanford
with a Women's Clubhouse. The suc
cess of this provision is found in the
fact thai by making a rendezvous for
the women of the university it has not
only furthered the companionship of a
few hut of all.
Upon graduation from Stanford, Miss
Mirrielees returned to Montana and
spent two years there. She accepted the
position in the Stanford faculty in 1909
and has been with the University since
that date, with the exception of occa
sional visits to the East and her trip
ibroad in the interest of the Stanford
Unit. Miss Mirrielees was in charge of
the unit of fourteen alumnae to
go to France, three of which are mem
ber-, of the faculty now, Miss Margaret
Lothrop and Miss Elizabeth Dana
Woodbridge accompanying her. The
unit worked with the Red Cross at Camp
Saint Nazaire in northern France for
five months, conducting a canteen for
the sick and wounded.
To show the value of the technical
skill in the work of Miss Mirrielees, she
is a contributor to the textbook recently
published by MacMillan for short story
writing in secondary schools in Cali
fornia containing a collection of model
short stories written by prominent
authors.
