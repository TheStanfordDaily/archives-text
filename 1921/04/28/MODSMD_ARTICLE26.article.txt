Editor "Cabbages," Dear Sir —As
you are read by the masses, I appeal
to you for succor in the alleviation
of an evil keenly visible to the naked
eye so to speak. Your note goes to
the crux of the matter.
I refer to the fact that the student,
continually prrceiving himself to he
under the necessity of traversing the
Library corridors, has his thought pro
cesses Interrupted by the couples
whose volatility of conversation is, if
you will, decidedly incommoding. Sir.
1 wish to be liberal. I realize that in
the halcyon days of adolescence the
charm of sex is one of inveiglement,
but, peradventure, 1 speak not magni
quolently or with thought of self when
I protest the most salient aspect ot
the evil.
Madhouse goes on with this—"With
j our ratio of four to one, the women
I have undue choice and are won't to
confine themselves to a lower strata
of scholarship, chiefly exemplified by
athletic men as if, as it were, aversion
existed toward those of more noble
elevation of brow. Intelligent man
that you are, you can readily discern
that unless the reverse becomes the
fact, we have a condition estrangeable
from Stanford Democracy, one that
jnust be removed. Perhaps, sir, in
the interest of vigor of expression, I
have sacrificed nicety of wording, but
I trust, sir, I have your forgiveness.
Sincerely, Percival Bertram Kappa."

For the benefit of the writer of the
above, forgiveness is not possible after
'such an epileptic attack of that con
tagious disease, verbiage. We fondly
hope that our correspondent and
I friend, Mr. Camembert, is unable to
I reciprocate.

"Well," remarked the Y. M. C. A.
worker, "if this bird won't subscribe,
maybe Mr. Lockwood."

We see that a San Jose newspaper
has accredited a Stanford man by the
name of Mosher with the recent rob
bery of bonds from the Library. He
got ten years in San Quentin. It's al
ways a pleasure to us to have the pub
lic learn of our high cost of living
through prison records. And after all.
he wasn't a Stanford man.

You tell 'em postage stamp, you've
been licked a lot.

This is an age when the old saying,
"Don't let the cat out of the bag,"
refers with equal force to potatoes
and rutabagas. Interview any house
wife.
Certain kidders on the campus think
they're the whole cheese—they're only
the holes in the cheese.
Owing to a slight mental disturb
ance, which for a moment unbalanced
some person connected with the make
up of the "Daily", today was heralded
as the time for the sentimental num
ber of Cabbages. Let it be known that
this ain't a place for sentiment. Senti
ment was never funny nor supposed
to be.
With regard to the fall of Babylon,
one would think the sudden drop were
into a pool, judging by the waves and
| ripples occasioned by the gigantic
splash. This was figured to be a
j figure.

Editor "Cabbages," Dear Sir —As
you are read by the masses, I appeal
to you for succor in the alleviation
of an evil keenly visible to the naked
eye so to speak. Your note goes to
the crux of the matter.
I refer to the fact that the student,
continually prrceiving himself to he
under the necessity of traversing the
Library corridors, has his thought pro
cesses Interrupted by the couples
whose volatility of conversation is, if
you will, decidedly incommoding. Sir.
1 wish to be liberal. I realize that in
the halcyon days of adolescence the
charm of sex is one of inveiglement,
but, peradventure, 1 speak not magni
quolently or with thought of self when
I protest the most salient aspect ot
the evil.
Madhouse goes on with this—"With
j our ratio of four to one, the women
I have undue choice and are won't to
confine themselves to a lower strata
of scholarship, chiefly exemplified by
athletic men as if, as it were, aversion
existed toward those of more noble
elevation of brow. Intelligent man
that you are, you can readily discern
that unless the reverse becomes the
fact, we have a condition estrangeable
from Stanford Democracy, one that
jnust be removed. Perhaps, sir, in
the interest of vigor of expression, I
have sacrificed nicety of wording, but
I trust, sir, I have your forgiveness.
Sincerely, Percival Bertram Kappa."

For the benefit of the writer of the

We see that a San Jose newspaper
has accredited a Stanford man by the
name of Mosher with the recent rob
bery of bonds from the Library. He
got ten years in San Quentin. It's al
ways a pleasure to us to have the pub
lic learn of our high cost of living
through prison records. And after all.
he wasn't a Stanford man.
