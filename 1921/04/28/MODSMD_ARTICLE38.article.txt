### 
Mr. Francisco Cornejo, whose pic
tures are to be exhibited at the Art
Gallery in May, was on the campus
today, making final arrangements for
the opening. He is interested in Stan
£ord because Palo Alto was once the
home of his family. Also Mr. Cornejo

Stanford, taught Geology here at the
University for three years, and is a
.relative of Mr. Alfonso Cornejo, now
head chemist at the United States
Potash Company, and the recipient of
a Stanford scholarship in Chemistry.
Mr. Manuel Centurion, the sculptor,
accompanied Mr. Cornejo. Many of
the displays are his personal works.
They include Mexica® furniture, minia
ture replicas of the most important
archeological monuments (executed in
plaster of Paris), and a large collec
tion of Mexican pottery.
