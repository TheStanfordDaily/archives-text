Phi Kappa Psi raised its average to
750 by handing the Chi Psi baseball
ers a eleven to thee defeat. Dick
Richmond, hurling for the victors, laid
down some speedy balls and had the
Chi Psi men doing good exercise in
bat-waving. The Phi Psi contingent
got off to a fast start in the first in
ning, scoring five runs. Wilcox, Chi
Psi pitcher, put the apple across the
home platter almost as fast as Rich
mond, but a connection by a batsman
usually resulted in safe bingle.
Sigma Chi shut out El Capitan with
a nice largo goose-egg, in the moan
while trotting the rubber platter seven
times. El Capitan played good ball
but possessed few sluggers who could
steal a hit off Young's twirling. In
the Rixth period, Meeken stepped to
the plato and found Nelson for a
homer, sending in two men before
him.
Encina basement of fifth floor for
feited to Delta Chi.
