a handicap of thirty, the Stanford
handicap being eight: Bilger and
Quimby, 3 each; Tolbert and Cecil,
1 each.
This game will be the first of a
series to be played with outside teams.
The game played with San Mateo last
Saturday was the first of the season.
Tom Driscoll, well-known San Mateo
polo player, gave Stanford enthusiasts
Sunday night a two-and a half-hour
lecture on mounts and the technique
of the game. Interest seems to be
growing in the game, and the San
Mateo players are reported as being
favorably impressed with the strides
made by the Stanford team. Polo is
recognized as a minor sport at Prince
ton, Yale and Pennsylvania.
The game next Wednesday will be
played on the Encina polo field.
