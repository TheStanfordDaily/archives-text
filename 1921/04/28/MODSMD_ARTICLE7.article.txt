# TWELVE RUNS IN INNING WIN FOR INTRAMURAL TEAM
## Kappa Sigma Defeats Beta Theta Pi, 12 to 5; Phi Psi and Sigma Chi Are Victors 
### 
A third inning rally by the Kappa
Sigma nine resulted in their winning
from Beta Theta Pi, 12 to 5. They
had been blanked up to that time. But
fortune indeed smiled in the third,
when the Kappa Sigma stickwielders
climbed on the gravy train for twelve
completed trips around the diamond.
Four re* hits and a general fielding
slip-up by the Beta aggregation ac
counted for the Kappa Sigma merry
go-round.
Sheahan, coming to bat for the
Betas in the first period, gained first
on the third baseman's error. Mertz
hit to right and Proctor drew first
when hit by Newlands. Reed fanned,
Mannoccir got a walk, scoring Shea
han for the first tally. A combination
of walks and errors brought in three
more for Beta Theta Pi. The second
inning netted the same team two more
runs. Kappa Sigma experts were
about ready to leave for home at this
time.
However, the third frame opened
the gate to the big aeroplane ride for
the Kappa Sigma nine. Powell, the
first batter, reached first on a pitcher's
error. Newlands duplicated this feat
on a run after a third strike. Spiers
hit to right and the thermometer ad
vanced a degree. Three scattered hits
and twice as many errors put the next
six men around the bases before the
ers a eleven to three defeat. Dick
lowed by an error and another walk,
tallied four more before the period
was closed for the Kappa Sigs. This
carnival concluded the scoring for
both teams. Batteries: Kappa Sigma,
