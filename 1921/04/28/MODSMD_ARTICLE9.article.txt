# Spring Football Practice Is Successful, Says Coach Powell
## 
### 
Spring football has been a big success
this year, according to a statement made
today by Coach Walter Powell. Several
promising prospccts for next fall's
Varsity have been found among the
large number of turnouts, while the at
titude ayd spirit in which the players
hav£ entered into the practice has
brought excellent results.
"I am very enthusiastic about some of
the prospccts who have turned out for
spring practice," stated Coach Powell.
"The men have entered into the spirit
of the game with a seemingly keen de
light which is very gratifying Such a
spirit is a good point in a beginner and
one that I like to sec.
"There arc several good men among
those working with me on the field
every afternoon, and with only about
seven or eight varsity men back for next
year's squad there will be great need for
these players. Spring practice is a big
benefit in more than thin one point, in

that it is a saving of time next year.
With a large number of green players
turning out for spring practice, no time
will have to be spent next fall in in
structing them in the elementary prin
ciples of the game.
"We have been working for nearly
three weeks now and I intend to hold
practice for about ten days more. The
men turning out are mostly those who
have had hut little football experience,
but the rapidity in which they have
managed to gather in the rudiments of
the game lias been surprising.
"The first week of practice was de
voted mostly to passing and catching the
ball and as the players became more
accustomed to the sport, the work was
made more strenuous. Blocking and
tackling were next taken tip, while they
were also made acquainted with picking
up the ball and charging and starting.
This week, the men are being given sig
nals, and 1 expect to have several scrim
mages before the end."
