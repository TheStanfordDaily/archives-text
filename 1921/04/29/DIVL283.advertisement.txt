RS the most wonderful summer dresses —cool organdies and jft]
ffl ginghams and little cretonne frocks that look as if they'd just stepped out of jffi
§ "Vogue." They have lots of sports things, too, especially silk skirts and gay jS
S looking scarfs that are positively Ic dernier tnot! (Just learned that today). Have
S my eye on something for you, only that's the surprise and I can't tell you—but
it's made of the most ravishing American Beauty shade of organdy— Sij

M on the third floor of the Women's Clubhouse. My, dear, I KNOW she could
[§] wave the straightest hair in the WORLD. Her water waves are always such a ft
S] satisfaction, and stay in for ages. It's such a joy simply to call "668-J" for an ft
Sj appointment and then run up for a convenient curl. Will treat you to one when ft
IS you're here. Mother visited me for a while last week and was wild about her ft
jS] facial and scalp treatments. Went in for 'em quite strenu- H
Kj ously and they really were marvelously beneficial. H

gj They have some of the most exciting offerings in their »ft
ffl Fifty-Sixth Anniversary Sale, making it truly a celebration. !y/ ft

iii Paly was responsible for the delicious pastries and patties. They make all ®
feni » their things fresh every day, and have truly a French
IfHI \yj touch. My Y. W. committee gave a luncheon Wednes-

P.-S.:—Forgot to mention the weather! It's been horrible warm these days — igj
IS really one can't even THlNK—and as for exes ! The only cool spot Ive jg
CQ found is the
a UNIVERSITY CREAMERY B
ra .... K
which offers quite a few effective ideas in the way of hot weather refreshment. gj
tej The ice cream they make is marvelous—so rich and velvety —truly IDEAL. And Eg
ra besides the usual assortment of brick ice cream, they make three, and four- TO
rfij flavored varieties. And as for such specialties as messelrode puddings in brick RE
FBI form, and their pineapple mousse—really you couldn't possibly imagine anything Rfl
S3 more enchanting. And it's all made right there at the store in Paly—everything
m absolutely pure and fresh every day. 00
Hfl P.-S.:—(again) Their chocolates are heavenly! [ftj
