# CLOSE CONTESTS IN INTRAMURAL MARK DAY'S PLAY
## Delta Tau Delta Defeats Phi Gamma Delta; Breakers Swamp Team from Sequoia 
### 
Yesterday's closest intramural con
teat was won by Delta Tau Delta'B
diamondeiu, with Phi Gamma Delta
on the short end of a 13 to 10 score.
In the third inning, the latter players
were apparently affected by the spring
time sun, when they allowed six runs
to be made ou a good many more er
rors than hits. Five of the tallies
were scored after two outs had been
chalked up. At the end of the fourth
period, Delta Tau Delta *was leadiug,
12 to 3. However, the Phi Gamma
Delta swatters swung a wicked willow
in the next two frames and threaten
ed to overcome their opponents' large
advantage by circling the bags seven
times. If there had been men on base
when either Russell or Williams came
to bat in the fifth, the game probably
would have had a different conclusion
since each clouted out a home run.
Benninger, on the slab for the win
ners, had the edge on both Kiggens
,and Sibley who hurled for Phi Gam
ma Delta.

The first triple play of the present
intramural season was pulled off last
night by the Sequoia 3 and 4 outfit,
with the obliging aid of Breakers' bat
ters. The Breakers had occupied sec
ond and third bases, when a batsman
popped a short fly into right field that
looked like a sure hit. Collins stretch
ed himself and succeeded in gathering
in the falling sphere before it reached
the ground. He threw to second forc
ing out the player who was attempt
ing to set back to that bag. Then,
Norse pegged home and Brazil nailed
at the plate a runner who had started
from third base. Regardless of all
this class on the part of the Sequoia
aggregation, the Breakers rolled in
with 13 tallies to Sequoia's 3.

Alpha Delta Phi put the skids into
El toro's nine by a 10-0 shutout.
Sparling was going good and held the
lowers down to a few scattered hits.

Alpha Chi Sigma defeated the Japan
ese Club, gaining eight runs to their
opponents' one. Koba who pitched a
tricky brand of ball scored the lone
tally for the Japanese Club.

The only forfeit of the day was made
by Rncina 1 and 2 to the Alpha Tau
Omega team which used the oppor
tunity for getting in some snappy
j>raetiee.
