# Stanford Nine Will Meet Federal Reserve Team Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
Coach Seay's nine meets the Feder
al Reserve team of San Francisco to
morrow on the home lot at 3:00 p.m.
The team is in probably the best con
dition that it has had since the bo
ginning of the season and the chances
look good for a deficit on the bankers'
side of the books. Draper is slated
to start the game for the Card√ü with
Nef and Kelly in reserve. The other
half of the battery will be filled by
Bundy who has Green for relief.

Since the defeat administered by
the Canucks last week, the team has
been working every day and has im
proved sufficiently to give any team
in this vicinity a good run for a vic
tory.

Either Berger, Feese Sutter will
toe the rubber against the Varsity.

These men have all had a lot of ex
perience and will keep the batsmen
working to get across. Ether will
probably protect the plate, the whole
distance unless Sanderson is given a
chance luter on. Gillenliand at first
has been playing better ball steadily
all quarter and is a fairly heavy hitter.
Anflnson and Edwards are lined up for
keystone positions of second and short
respectively. Brown, another sticker
is posted at third. The field has
Benn in left, Bertram in center and
Overton at right. The team as a whole
is well balanced and offers keen com
petition for the Varsity.

Ken Lilly is to do the deciding.
Lilly had considerable experience in
professional baseball and has been do
ing good umpiring for the frosh since
the beginning of the season, being
ineligible for Varsity baseball.

Graduate-Manager Martin is await
ing a cablegram from Mr. Kuahiviki,
the Japanese sports promoter, who is
managing the project, before making
the final arrangements. Mr. Kuehi
viki was an official at the Panama
Pacific International Exposition and
while in San Francisco conceived the
idea of a collegiate summer tour in
his country,. He is managing the
Japanese part of the tour and the
plans are to have the teams from Ber
keley and Stanford leave for the East
as soon as possible after the close of
college here in June.
