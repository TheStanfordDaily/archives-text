# EXTENSIVE STUDY IS MARJORIE DRISCOLL'S WORD TO JOURNALISTS
## 
### 
"Know a little of everything â€” from
music to the elements of a rugby game."
This is Marjorie Driscoll's advice to the
man or woman who would, make a suc
cess of newspaper work. Miss Driscoll
who is a Stanford graduate, and feature
writer for the San Francisco Chronicle,
gave some of her work at
an informal gathering of journalism stu
dents at the home of Professor Everett
W. Smith last evening.
Miss Driscoll spoke of the advantages
to be gained from work on the news
paper of the small town where every
phase of the work can he studied and
practiced. She cited instances of where
a working knowledge of law, or music,
or sports had proved of actual benefit in
securing stories, and told of the best way
to go about getting news.
An ability to secure an unusual slant
on everyday occurrences and a knowl
edge of the rudiments of spelling and
punctuation were given as the best
means of getting in the good graces of
the city editor. She suggested study of
history and geography and other'prac
tical subjects as of great value in her
work.
The opportunity for women to be suc
cessful in newspaper work was empha
sized by the speaker, who said that the
woman who goes after a story today is
on a level with the men covering the
same story. The chance for them in
executive positions is steadily increasing,
she said.
Miss Driscoll's eight years' experience
has included every branch of reporting
and editing on the Pasadena Star-News,
and feature writing of various kinds on
the San Francisco Chronicle. While
she has been connected with the news
paper game she has been an earnest stu
dent of its possibilities and future, which
made her remarks last night the more
interesting.
Before Miss Driscoll spoke, the group
enjoyed an in forma ldlnner as the guests
of Mr. and Mrs. Smith.
