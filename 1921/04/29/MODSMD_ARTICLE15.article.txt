# Stanford-in-China Drive Scheduled to End Tuesday
## 
### 
Although no reports have yet come in
from the Row, the Lockwood Fund was
increased to $350 by a few Hall returns
and some contributions from Palo Alto
people who knew Mr. Lockwood. The
drive will close Tuesday night definitely
and the workers are requested to turn in
their pledges and money that evening.
Dr. Morgan is confident that the goal
will be passed at the final counting of
the contributions.
