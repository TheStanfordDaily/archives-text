# MOVE TO RAISE SCHOLARSHIP OF GROUPS PLANNED
## Remedy for Lower Standing of Fraternities Suggested by Professor C. B. Whittier 
### 
Owing to the fact that scholarship of
fraternities as a group and as individual
organizations is continuously lower than
that of other University living group\
Professor C B. Whittier, head of the
scholarship committee, has submitted a
plan in which he sees a possible remedy,
!o the 1 nterfraternity Conference and
Panhellenic Association.

The proposed plan, which is now un
der consideration by the fraternity men
and women, provides that all organiza
tions for social, housing, or boarding
purposes, must cach year keep up to the
general average or lose the right to take
in new members for the following two
quarters. The general average for or
ganizations for men is the average of all
university men, for organizations of
women is the average Of .all the-women,
for organizations including both men
and women, the general university aver
age. The plan is therefore not confined
to the fraternities and sororities, but ex
tends to all organizations for similar
purposes. It has bA?n suggested that it
should apply to all organizations of
every kind that select their own mem
bership. The new plan would go into
effect gradually so that the organiza
tions would not have to be fully up to
the general average for three years.

The averages have been compiled
from the University records beginning
when the present grade point system
went into effect, and the records show
that the average of fraternity men is
below the average of the University and
the average of all of the men, while the
fraternity women's average is above that
of the University but below the average
of the women.
The table of averages for the year
1920 gives the following standing:
University average 1.38
Men's average 1.29
Fraternity men 1.24
Women's average 1.73
Fraternity women 1.68
A similar plan for raising the scholar
ship in 'fraternities has been tried at the
University of Texas. The scholarship
committee investigated its success there
with the following results taken from a
letter received from that institution:
"On the whole, the faculty and the fra
ternities themselves are satisfied that the
regulations are practicable and alto
gether excellent in their effects. Dean
Benedict says that he takes more pride
in the part he had in framing these regu
lations than in any other legislation
passed during his deanship."
The complete plan of the scholarship
committee follows: "Every organiza
tion of students, primarily for social,
housing or boarding purposes, which se
lects its own members, must as a condi
tion precedent to pledging, electing, or
initiating new members in any year, have
maintained in the year immediately pre
ceding an average within twenty hun
dredths of the grade point average of
the University if the organization con
sists of both men and women, of the
average of the women if the organiza
tion consists of women, and of the aver
age of the men if the organization con
sists of men. Any organization which
falls below the requirement may regain
the right to add to its membership by
obtaining the necessary average in the
autumn quarter and maintaining it
through the winter quarter. This regu
lation shall take effect one year from
the opening of the fall quarter following
its enactment. After it has been in
operation one year, the required average
shall be raised to ten hundredths below
in each case; after it has been in opera
tion two years, the required average shall
be the same as that of the University,
the women, or the men, as the case may
be.'"
In commenting on the plan Professor
YVhittier adds: "The above rule, if ap
plied to the fraternities and sororities
for the present year, would not have ex
cluded any, sororities from initiating and
would have excluded only three fraterni
ties. No doubt with a year's notice be
fore the rule goes into effect, which is
provided for, all fraternities could com
ply with it. In the following two years,
time is given them to raise their scholar
ship to the general average."
