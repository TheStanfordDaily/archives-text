# FRENCH CLUB WILL STAGE SHORT PLAYS BY FAMOUS AUTHOR
## 
### 
Two comedies of Max Maurey, cele
brated French playright, will be staged
by the Cercle Francais on May 11 as part
of the program given for the benefit of
the club's French orphans. "L'Alise de
Nuit'' (Night Lodging) and "Le Phar
macien" (The Druggist) are the plays
to be presented.
Maurey for several years was director
at the Grand Guignol, a theater at Paris
famous for its production of "thrillers.**
Maurey's literary efforts, however, were
turned in another direction, and from
his pen have come several well-known
short comedies, or curtain-raisers,
among which are those chosen by the
Ccrcle Francais.

The scene of "L'Alise de Nuit" is laid
in a municipal lodging house, and its
characters and dialogue are particularly
funny. The second play, although in a
little different vein, is no less conducive
to laughter, its action being laid in a
drug store. Both comedies are modern
in the strictest sense of the word.
In addition to the plays, work on the
French choral numbers, which are to be
given by the women alone, is progressing
rapidly under the direction of Miss
Jessie Smith. There will be several other
numbers on the program which will be
announced later.
It is the custom xrf the Ccrcle Francais
once a year to give an entertainment,
the proceeds of which go to the support
of French orphans for the ensuing year.
