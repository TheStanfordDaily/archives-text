# SHOULD THEY EXIST?

### 
The spring - bidding and initiation into honor fraternities is now
upon us. Daily on the Quad we see men buttonholed, and in the conver
sations which follow they are told of the collegiate benefit and profes
sional value of membership in the organizations. What will follow after
the initiation check has been signed? The Stanford societies vary in the
seriousness of their work to as great an extent as there are organizations.
For all of them initiation banquets, with or without refreshment, are
customary. Business and social meetings are scheduled, regularly or
occasionally. That some of these meetings possess a real value, profes
sional or otherwise, to the members reveals by sharp contrast the futility
of an "empty-shell" society which ends its activities after issuing a pin
or key.
The crux of the trouble, if it can be named in one phrase, can be
said to lie in the backward-looking policy of the fraternity members.
The Stanford organizations as a group arc honor societies in the past
tense. Usually several years of work in an activity or study precedes
membership, and when the coveted key is secured, the initiate/ with a
sense of having reached the end of a journey, considers the key as 110
more than a reward for past work.
If the Stanford societies are to occupy the place in student life
which rightfully is theirs, emphasis must be placed upon the future tense
of membership. Not as an emblem for completed effort, but as an op
portunity for future service does the honor society key possess signifi
cance. Stanford can afford to dispense with any organization whose
sole impress upon student life is through a page in the Quad.
Potentially, the honor societies are the dominant agencies in an ef
fective and vital .student leadership. Their members are regarded as the
leaders of campus life. Their aims form tiie basis for revitalizing stu
dent thought. Their organizations can serve as the framework for prac
tical accomplishment. Spring neophytes in honor societies can not
afford to forget that the true value and purpose of their membership
does not end at initiation but only begins after the grip and password
have been given.
