# OUR DEAD IN FRANCE.

### 
France is willing—indeed it is her wish—to care for the cemeteries where lie
American soldiers in the soil they defended with imperishable valor. Most beauti
ful in their Spring verdure and the peace of white crosscs are these bivouacs of
the dead until ugly gaps are made in the earth to take up what is left of those
who tnade the great sacrifice, for removal to the United States. Is it well to con
tinue the work? Colonel Roosevelt said of his son Quentin: "Let the yonng oak
lie where it fell." General Pershing, Major General John F. O'Ryan and other
American commanders have been opposed to bringing home the American dead.
They, knew how proud were the French people to treasure the heroic remains in
their soil, testimony to a noble alliance in a comman cause; and they knew that
the historic burial places would have the tenderest perpetual care. Also, they
understood what havoc war had made of the human body, and how difficult and
uncertain identification sometimes would be. They honored the sentiment of those
who wanted to bury their own dead at home, but they felt a greater appeal in the
association of the fallen American soldiers with the battle fields of France.
Owen Wister in a letter cabled to The New York Times speaks very plainly
of what he considers the mistake of disturbing the graves of American soldiers in
the French cemeteries. He thinks the work of disinterment, where all was peace
and reverence before, is the saddest sight in France. "Poor fragments of hu
manity," he calls the bodies taken up. "They have been dragged," he says, "from
the soil their sacrifice made sacred and where as an honored and cared-for com
pany they lay in peace, their graves tended, their memory historic and precious
to France." And he declares : "No mother could come to France and see where
her boy lies and not be comforted ami thankful lie is there." After visiting the
great cemetery at Romagne, "where over 22,000 of our boys lie with the American
flag floating above them and visible for miles across the country they defended,"
Thomas Nelson Page says: "It seems desecration to dig them up."
The British and the Belgians, who are as loyal to the memory of their fallen
soldiers as we are, have been content to let their dead lie in the soil of France,
at peace and gratefully tended. An American visitor to the French cemeteries
this Spring makes this moving appeal: "We shouldn't take away from "these
young men who gave their lives the honor of resting amid the scenes of their
supreme sacrifice." It seems unanswerable. —Nezv York Times.
