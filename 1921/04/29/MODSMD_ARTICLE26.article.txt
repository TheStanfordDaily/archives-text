The Roman bath, made popular by-
Los Angeles, Nero, and Louise Glaum,
is with us again and this time the fair
occupant is Bebe Daniels. She is to be
seen therein for a few fleeting moments
in "Ducks and Drakes," down at the
Stanford Theater. As a whole, this pic
ture of a girl who was cured of flirting ;
offers very pleasant entertainment.
After Wm. S. Hart's recent appear-i
ance in a police uniform one shouldn't
be surprised to walk into the Varsity and
find Wally Reid rigged out as a full
blown railroader. "The Love Special'" is
the title of this effort and though it
sounds like one of Stickey's sundaes it
is a railroad drama with a thrilling race
in it. Of course the picture is mainly
Wallace Reid—but who objects to that?
