# THREE HUNDRED QUAD COPIES UNSOLD; SALE CAMPAIGN NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The three hundred remaining unsold
copies of the 1922 Quad will be placed
on sale by Manager William H. Vos
burgh in a three-day campaign next
week. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday managerial tryoutees on the
Quad will be stationed on the Engineer
ing Corner to make advance sales of the
year-book.
Manager Vosburgh expects that the
entire edition of 1922 Quads will be sold
out in advance of the publication of the
book. Of the 1300 copies ordered this
year, 400 were sold to members of the
Junior Class last fall, 100 were bought
by the student body, and 500 have been
sold by individual subscription. As only
31X) copies remain unpurchased, the de
mand for Quads this year will undoubt
edly exceed the supply.
Rapid advances in the editorial prepa

ration of the book have been made in
the past week. Over a half of the sec
tions have been run through the press
and the remaining pages are being quick
ly printed. Shortly following Junior
Week, Editor Fisher expects to turn the
last page of copy over to the press.
