# PSYCHIC REACTION FOUND IN COLORS
## Unconscious Response to Pigments is Part of Novel Illumination of Junior Opera 
### 
Unconscious reaction to the sugges
tions held in a color thrown about a
place by the use of lights, gives one the
impression that a treatise in psychology
was in the making, but such is not the
case. The lighting for the Junior Opera
has, however, been worked out for the
whole plot after a series of investiga
tions conductcd by Ernest Greppin, '24,
and will be noteworthy for its unique
method.
In China, the first tests were made
as to the reactions experienced by the
human mind when treated to pertain
colors and varieties of color. Different
shades were found to cause different
thoughts in every case. From this start,
Greppin conducted investigations of his
own in the psychology laboratories of
the University, and corroborated the
findings of the Chinese investigators.
He has achieved results that make the
success of the scheme an assured fact.

The new draperies for the back and
sides of the stage are of a grayish tone.
This color, according to the psycholog
ical tests, is the one that can be most
easily played upon by the other color
combinations and was purchased for
that reason. Greppin has taken the plot
and arranged sets of spot lights to keep
the stage in a flood of rich hues
throughout the entire performance. This
will, he explains, keep the audicnce in
sympathy with the plot at all times, and
by the manipulation of the different
lights the interest can be directed to any
point desired. Telephonic communica
tion has been made with all points of the
stage from a central station in the pro
jecting room at the back of the assem
bly and all the lighting effects will be
directed from that central placc.
