The main feature of the refresh

teen sheep. Sam McDonald, care
taker of the Stanford athletic grounds,
will have charge of this function.

Sam McDonald, who is the custodi
an of the campus sheep, in addition to
his duties on the athletic fields, is the
owner of a menagerie consisting of
rabbits, chickens, cows, pheasunts, and
dogs. During the football season he
is in charge of the handling of the
crowds, regulation of traffic, sale and
collection of tickets. Sam has been
on the campus for thirteen years, and
is the owner of a house in Mayfield
and in Woodside. in addition to his
campus residence.
Labor Day is an opportunity for
Stanford students to save the Univer
sity several hundred dollars by doing
the work which is needed around the
former Stanford residence, now in use
as a convalescent home for children
patients of the Lane Hospital in San
Francisco. An effort is being made
to make the day one of both pleasure
and usefulness, as the program testi
fies. There is much work which needs
to be done around the grounds and
the will be furnished
by the University and time will be
furnished by the dismissal of after
noon classes.
