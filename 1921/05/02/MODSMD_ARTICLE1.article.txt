# OPERA TICKETS Will BE PUT ON SALE TOMORROW
## Large Advance Sale Expected For Junior Show; Costumes Arrive for Picture Taking 
### 
Tickets for the Junior Opera will
be placed on sale tomorrow at 1 o'clock
in the Administration Building. Draw
ings for preference will take place
then and the seat sale will be started
immediately. Judging from the
phenomenal advance sale of the cards
to the Prom there will be a large
overdemand for opera seats this year
and those who come late will be left
out in the cold.

The price for the pasteboards will
be 511.75 for the choice seats in the
downstairs section, and $1.35 for the
rest of the house. The sales will be
conducted tomorrow afternoon, and
then if any of the tickets are left after
the scramble they will be put out at a
later date. The advice of the wise is
to come early and get in the rush.

There are only three more days of
practice before the opera and the
cast is working in fine shape to get
into trim before the last one. That
will probably be Thursday, and will
also be the final dress rehearsal.
There will be no practice Friday night
due to the Junior Prom.

Costumes have arrived for the show.
The pictures of the different cast
members were taken Friday afternoon
in costume and there are some beau
tiful clothes among those that have
been sent down so far. All the
costumes are new and of the most
original sort. They match the themes
of all the songs and with the special
lighting effects that are being intro
duced will be one of the hits of the
play. The variety is greater this year
than before and no expense has been
spared to get the most perfect gowns
for the beauties and the ponies. Some
have been especially designed to fit
the songs that they are used with, and
will go a long way to make the show
the success that is predicted.
