# COMPTROLLER IS BACK FROM TRIP OF INSPECTION
## A. E. Roth Returns From Visit To Sixteen Universities, Studying Administrations 
### 
A. E. Roth, Comptroller of Stanford
I niversity, has returned to the campus
after a five weeks' trip during which he
visited sixteen universities in the East
and Middle West, studying their admin
istration methods, particularly with re
gard to business and financial manage
ment. He was accompanied by Mrs.
Roth, and on the return trip they met
with Stanford alumni in New York, Chi
cago, Baltimore, and Ann Arbor.
"Everywhere," Comptroller Roth says,
"1 find among Stanford alumni and
among other colleges, an interest in the
Eood Research Institute which has been
established at Stanford, and in Stan
ford's plan for an athletic stadium.
Stanford is everywhere envied by other
universities for having the Eood Re
search Institute established here. East
ern universities regard it as the most
significant gift to any American uni
versity in the last ten years and the one
which offers the greatest possibilities.
"Stanford's plan for an earth em
bankment stadium capable of seating
more than 65,000 spectators impresses
almost all Eastern institutions as an ad
inirable idea. Some colleges which have
stadiums expressed the wish that they
had heard o four plan before they be
gan building."
Comptroller Roth says that upon his
return to Stanford after visiting other
colleges campuses he is more than ever
impressed with the advantages of his
own university. "No other university,"
he says, "possesses the possibilities of
our campus. Many of the Eastern cam
puses have acquired the dignity and
beauty of age, but none is so free to
develop as ours, surrounded as they are
by city property which comes up to their
gates. And none of them offers the all
round possibilities for the development
of students physically, socially, and men
tally which arc offered by our Stanford
environment. With our wide spaces and
many athletic fields, our own typical
student life, our small classes handled
by competent teachers, Stanford stu
dents enjoy larger opportunities than
those of any other university.
"I find in most Esatern universities,
as at Stanford, a pride in the appear
ance of their campuses which adminis
trative officers are taking advantage of
in building up an attitude to safeguard
the enjoyment and comfort of those on
their campuses, just as at Stanford
campus residents have voluntarily united
to protect the campus community against
speeding automobilists. On several col
lege campuses 1 saw signs indicating that
student pride was relied upon to main
tain the beauty and dignity of the col
