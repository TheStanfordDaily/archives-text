# SAUNDERS EXPLAINS KOREAN SITUATION
## 
### 
Declaring that the struggle in Korea
was spiritual rather than economic, Mr.
Kenneth J. Saunders, speaking on Korea
and Japan at the Little Theater yester
day, said, "The Japanese occupation of
Korea is inevitably the acid test of her
civilization.
"Korea," Mr. Saunders continued, "is
a pistol aimed at the heart of Japan.
The great liberal statesman, Marquis,
afterward Trince Ito, gave the crux of
the matter when he said, 'The interests
of Japan and Korea are so far identical
in the Far East that we cannot allow
Korea to be cared for hy any other for
eign nation except ourselves.' If any
nation has the right to go into another's
territory and control it in the interests
of self-defense, then a great deal has
been said for the right of Japan in
Korea. This right was axiomatic dur
ing the nineteenth century and it would
be hypocritical to criticize Japan on
that score.
The Japanese have improved the con
ditions of Korea by a great work of re
forestation and railway construction.
The great Manchurian railway from
Seul to Mukden was built by the
Japanese, and a vigorous railway service
installed. A stable financial system has
been built up. Japanese merchants a
few years ago had to charter a ship to
carry the clumsy coinage of Korea to
pay the sum of 10.000 yen. Now credit
exchanges are made through a modern
banking system.
However, despite these material im
provements, the spirit in which Japan is
making them is far loss admirable.
There is a deliberate attempt to sup
press national aspirations through edu
cation and by the destruction of the
ancient Korean literature and the history
of the people.
The Koreans have not resorted to vio
lence, however. Ihe following extract
from the Declaration of Independence
of the Koreans indicates the spirit of
patience which animates them: "Vic-
Itims of ail older age when brute force
and the spirit of plunder ruled, we have
come, after these long thousands of
years to experience the agony of ten
years of foreign aggression with every
loss of the right to live, every restriction
of freedom of thought and every oppor
tunity lost to share in the intellectual
advance of the age in which we live.
Rut let us not be filled with bitterness
or rancor over past injuries. A new
4 era wakes before our eyes A new
j world of righteousness and truth is here,
f We awake now from that old world
£ with its dark conditions with full de
termination, with one heart and one
V*
fr mind along with the forces of nature to
£ achieve a new life. May all our old
£ ancestors from the thousandth and ten
!• thousandth generation aid us as we go
£ forward."
j* The hope of Japan is in leaders of
► liberalism like Mr. Osaka and Mr. Yo
£ shima, fierce critics of imperialism.
!* They hold that Korea must be admitted
* to a free partnership with the Japanese
* in the ruling of their country.
