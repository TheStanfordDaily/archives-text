# WORTHY WORK THAT IS PLAY
## 
### 
.Shovels, hoes, and overalls are in order for members of the student
body who arc out to enjoy a good barbecue and program of stunts and
dancing scheduled by the Labor Day Committee for tomorrow afternoon.
The whole of a half holiday tomorrow partakes of a University event of
unusual nature. The program yi the first place is primarily for the benefit
of deserving enterprise not directly connected with the student body, and
secondly it is not designed to take money away from the students who
take part in the festivities.
It is seldom that the members of the Associated Students individually
or collectively come out of the rut and take notice of any of the rest of the
world. Often we are forced artificially to do so by the various drives con
ducted for worthy outside purposes, and to them students are persuaded to
surrender portions of fathers' remittances, not with the conviction of sup
j/Orting a worthy cause, but with the air of one who was unjustly "nailed"
and couldn't graciously get away. In general, mighty few enterprises
"rate" the cheerful award of any portion of a student's income.
Several hundrecTtvorthy and needy children of San Francisco who,
because of necessity of medical attention, have come to the notice of the
Stanford Hospital, are brought to the Convalescent I lome on the campus,
and are given a chance again to grow to normal, healthy citizens. The
Hoard in chargeof the Convalescent Home has a serious problem in mak
ing both ends come together. The student body has not been approached
for money, but last year voluntarily initiated the custom of setting aside
one afternoon to go en masse to the Home and put the grounds\md
buildings in the best order possible.
Here, then, every member of the student body may do a small
though appreciable part in a worth-while service of other deserving per
sons, of human kind if we put it that way. And the ability to serve is
not measured by the size of the monthly note from home, but on the
ogod will of the student. Men who have been financially unable to give
freely to otfier services may more than make up for any deficiency by
a few hours of his time.
The student body has selected its own way of doing a service to
many worthy children of the city, that of an all-University party in
which ever one may enjoy himself while yet he is doing a piece of good
work. The attractive program of the Labor- Day Committee, coupled
with the motive of service, will undoubtedly take most of the University
to the Home tomorrow, and the grounds should accordingly take on a
spruce and inviting appearance that will delight many helpless little men
and women in the next year, and aid in giving them a chance to grow
up.

FROM THE Michigan Daily we learn that certain eastern engineers
recently moved a Pittsburgh sky-scraper, basements, sidewalks, and all
a distance of forty feet to make possible the widening of the street; and
did so without even disturbing business operations in the building.
Columbia's idea of a floating stadium might be a serious one after all.

one afternoon to go en masse to the Home and put the grounds\md
buildings in the best order possible.
Here, then, every member of the student body may do a small
though appreciable part in a worth-while service of other deserving per
sons, of human kind if we put it that way. And the ability to serve is
not measured by the size of the monthly note from home, but on the
ogod will of the student. Men who have been financially unable to give
freely to otfier services may more than make up for any deficiency by
a few hours of his time.
The student body has selected its own way of doing a service to
many worthy children of the city, that of an all-University party in
which ever one may enjoy himself while yet he is doing a piece of good
work. The attractive program of the Labor- Day Committee, coupled
with the motive of service, will undoubtedly take most of the University
to the Home tomorrow, and the grounds should accordingly take on a
spruce and inviting appearance that will delight many helpless little men
and women in the next year, and aid in giving them a chance to grow
up.

FROM THE Michigan Daily we learn that certain eastern engineers
recently moved a Pittsburgh sky-scraper, basements, sidewalks, and all
a distance of forty feet to make possible the widening of the street; and
did so without even disturbing business operations in the building.
Columbia's idea of a floating stadium might be a serious one after all.

PROFESSOR RAYMOND G. GETTELL of Amherst, who espeaks in
the Little Theater tonight should interest a number of students who reg
istered in certain famous "Poly Sci" introductory courses not long ago.
.Shovels, hoes, and overalls are in order for members of the student
body who arc out to enjoy a good barbecue and program of stunts and
dancing scheduled by the Labor Day Committee for tomorrow afternoon.
The whole of a half holiday tomorrow partakes of a University event of
unusual nature. The program yi the first place is primarily for the benefit
of deserving enterprise not directly connected with the student body, and
secondly it is not designed to take money away from the students who
take part in the festivities.
It is seldom that the members of the Associated Students individually
or collectively come out of the rut and take notice of any of the rest of the
world. Often we are forced artificially to do so by the various drives con
ducted for worthy outside purposes, and to them students are persuaded to
surrender portions of fathers' remittances, not with the conviction of sup
j/Orting a worthy cause, but with the air of one who was unjustly "nailed"
and couldn't graciously get away. In general, mighty few enterprises
"rate" the cheerful award of any portion of a student's income.
Several hundrecTtvorthy and needy children of San Francisco who,
because of necessity of medical attention, have come to the notice of the
Stanford Hospital, are brought to the Convalescent I lome on the campus,
and are given a chance again to grow to normal, healthy citizens. The
Hoard in chargeof the Convalescent Home has a serious problem in mak
ing both ends come together. The student body has not been approached
for money, but last year voluntarily initiated the custom of setting aside
one afternoon to go en masse to the Home and put the grounds\md
buildings in the best order possible.
