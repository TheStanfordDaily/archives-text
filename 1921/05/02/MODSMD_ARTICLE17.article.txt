# PALO ALTO HIGH NAMED CHAMP OF PENINSULA LEAGUE
## 
### 
r
With one of the fastest high school jj
nines seen in this vicinity for several
years, Palo Alto High captured the []
championship of the Peninsula Athletic C
League by defeating Santa Clara Satur- C
day morning on the Stanford diamond, p
S to 2. g
The game was fast and far above the jn
usual exhibition of higli school baseball. [
The Palo Alto sluggers had on their hat- [
ting togs and had little trouble in find- C
ing the offerings of the opposing pitcher C
when hits meant runs. A1 Green, |j
_ brother of the captain-elect of the Stan-
ford Varsity, who is captain and coach ji
of the Palo Alto nine, had his team play
ing a smart brand of baseball, in addition
to doing some timely hitting and pitch- H
ing himself. The next game for Palo •{
Alto will probably be in the semi-finals jj
for the championship of Northern Cali- j
fornix. •
