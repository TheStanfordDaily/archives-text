# WOMEN'S SWIMMING MEET CALLED OFF; NO MORE SCHEDULES
## 
### 
The meet between the upper and
lower-class women's swimming teams
of Stanford and Mills College sched
uled for last Saturday, was called off
by Mills, because of an interruption of
their departmental work, due to the ill
ness of Miss Elizabeth Stone, head of
the Physical Education department.
There will be no other swimming meet
with Mills this quarter.
Practice will begin at once for the !
class meets which are to be held pre
paratory to the interclass meet on
Field Day, according to Dorothy
George, women's swimming manager.
These meets will be run off in the
same manner and with the same
schedule of events as an interclass
meet and the class teams will be
picked from these who show up best
in these contests.
Although the enthusiasm for swim
! ming as a sport has been greater
| than ever bei'rtre, those in charge of
the activitiy are anxious to have
| everyone who is at all interested turn
out for the class meets. All who have
not yet signed should see either
j Dorothy George or Mrs. Brandsten as
j soon as possible.
