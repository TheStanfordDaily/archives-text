## TIME FOR STARTING IS 1 P.M. Workers Will Meet in Corporation Yard and Go to Clinic; Program Includes Stunts and Barbecue 
### 
Promptly at 1 o'clock tomorrow, the students of Stanford University will
gather in the Corporation Yard to clean up the grounds about the old Stan
ford residence, now the Children's Convalescent Home, the occasion being
the University's second annual Labor Day, and the time being furnished by
dismissing afternoon classes. Here the workers will be divided into groups,
each under a lieutenant, with a definite duty for each group. Thenc ethe stu
dents will march in a body to the scene of activities. Putting the property
in shipshape will be the order of the day, until 5 o'clock, when refreshments
will be served, to be followed by an entertainment. Chairman C. J. Tauzer,
'20, announces that the committee has made full preparations to take charge
of the occasion.

A. J. Harzfeld, '20, R. H. Armstrong, '21, and Ruth Davis, '21, who are in
charge of the entertainments, have arranged the program to be given after
the barbecue. • This will include Jack Heffernan in original songs, the Stan
ford Glee Club in some of its recent successes, and a number by Lester Seib.
Dr. Gardner will give an address. The women of Roble will present a skit
by Margaret McCall, '21, and solo dances will be given by Kirby Ingoldsby
and Mary Sloan. The Stanford Band has agreed to play throughout the day.

Foreman Paul Campbell, by dividing the workers into groups, has made sure
that every branch of the work will be adequately covered. Among the
duties for the day will be the cleaning of the old Stanford family orchards,

felling trees about the grounds, which
have become a menace to the children,
hoeing the weeds about the Home,
taking away rubbish, etc. The trees
to be felled will be split into firewood.
Six hundred tools will be furnished
by the corporation yard for the oc
casion, among which will be hoes,
rakes, picks, shovels, axes and saws.
Men have been at work for the past
few days sharpening these implements.
Chairman Fred Adams appeals to
every one to see that the tools are
returned to the corporation yard, and
a truck has been provided for that
purpose.
Two trucks have been secured from
the military department by Guy Draper
and Ed Butler, in charge of the dray
age. Several wagons and a number
of wheel barrows are to be furnished
by the corporation yard. The debris
will be transported to San Francisqu
ito gulch.
The barbecuing of fifteen sheep is
to be the feature of the refreshment
end. Sam McDonald, the noted func
tionary of the spit, will be in charge.
The committee, headed by Hugh Gris
wold and Anna Judge, has also made
arrangements for eight dozen sand
wiches to be furnished by each soro
rity. Roble Hall is to furnish and
prepare the coffee, with cream and
sugar to fit. A Boston Bean Bake is
also on the program.

Mary Sprott, in charge of the Wo
men's Division, announces that the
work of her department will not only
include the preparation and serving
of the refreshments, but that the
garden will also be put in shape
through their efforts.

Labor Day gives the students at
Stanford an opportunity to donate
several hundred dollars to the chil
dren, as the work about the old Stan
ford residence would otherwise have
to be done by outside labor. The Stan
ford Convalescent Home for Children
takes care of the youthful patients
from the Lane Hospital of San Fran
cisco, when it is found that home con
ditions are unsuitable for recovery
after being discharged from the hos
pital. The Home is in charge of
former Stanford students, and those
directly interested.

Trees planted by notable people
adorn the grounds of the Founders'
residence, notably one planted by
President Hayeß. Here also is the
mystic maze, in which Leland Stan
ford, Junior, played as a child.
