In this lecture Mr. Schwartz will ex

of its mythology. While he lived in
Japan, he made a special study of this
religion anil the results of his investiga
tions were published by the Asiatic So

Great Shrine of Idzumo; Some Notes
on Shinto, Ancient and Modern." Mr.
Schwartz will describe a pilgrimage
which he made in 1912 to the shrine of
the God of Love and Marriage and dur
ing which he was a guest of the high
priest of the shrine.

The lecturc will be illustrated with
about fifty slides, a large number of
which were colored in Japan. These
slides show the religious practices of the
worshipers of Shinto, such as pilgrims
on their way to shrines, temple dances
and festivals, and the rituals of the
priests.
