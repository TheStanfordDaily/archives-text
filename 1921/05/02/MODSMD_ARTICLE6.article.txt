# SEATS MEN TAKE 6 TO 4 VICTORY OFF RESERVISTS
## Anfinson of "Feds" Swings for Two Home-runs; Draper Takes Seven Strike-outs 
### 
The Cardinal diamond artists took
the heavy end of a 6 to 4 score when
they met the Federal Reserve Club
of San Francisco, on the local field
Saturday afternoon. Anfinson of the
visitors tried to upset all reasonable
calculations by swatting the sphere
for two home runs and a double. He
is a little man, but there is a recoil
in his swinging machinery which sends
the apple on a long journey.

Nef toed the slab for the home
team during the first five innings, and,
with the exception of Anfinson and
Bertram of the opposition, he had
little trouble in keeping the bases
clear. The first ball thrown looked
good to Anfinson and he drove it to
deep center for his first completed
journey. Bertram had the traveling
fever, too, and launched a long one
to left for two bases. The next two
entries look the count but Benn clip
ped a single to right, scoring Bert
ram, and giving the visitors two mark
ers to open the affray with. In the
second frame, "Mort" Kline, Cardinal
clean-up man, drove through the key
stone area for a single, and a passed
ball and some clever stealing gave us
a tally in spite of the one-two-three
count which followed Kline's swat.

Anfinson came back in the third for
his two-ply knock but it failed to get
results for he got no farther. The
fourth was a quick succession on both
sides with Nef chalking up two strike
outs out of the seven which he garner
rd, in five frames. The Anfinson-Bert
rara combination swung into line
again in the fifth for an exact dupli
cate of their first inning sally, and
netted two more runs. This gave the
bankers four to our one. Patterson
decided to outwit the jinx and placed
a single over the keystone. Hecken
dorf took the cue and repeated the
process to right, scoring "Pat." Mit
chell didn't want to interrupt the
good work so he tapped another one
out, scoring "Lefty" with the third
Cardinal tally. Mitchell isn't a bit
hogish though, for he attempted sec
ond and took the count.
Draper trotted into the play with
his old soup-bone in the sixth and
ladled out seven straight strikeouts
to the money-lenders, the last gentle
man to take his medicine being the
aforementioned, apple-rapping Anfin
son. Kallam, Green, and Kline, breath
ed in some of the fumes from "Drap's"
magic tonic, and walloped the pellet
for two singles and a triple. Patter
son came up for his second hit and
when the dust of the travelers settled
the records showed six in the store
house for Seay's proteges.
This was the last offensive from
either front. The last two bankers
at the rubber popped into the trusty
milt of "Pat". On receiving the last
one he jammed the apple into his
pocket and made a dash for the dress
ing room. Six or seven of the Cards
gave chase and the next focus on them
showed the untangling process of a
general "Strangler" Lewis encounter.

stone area for a single, and a passed
ball and some clever stealing gave us
a tally in spite of the one-two-three
count which followed Kline's swat.

Anfinson came back in the third for
his two-ply knock but it failed to get
results for he got no farther. The
fourth was a quick succession on both
sides with Nef chalking up two strike
outs out of the seven which he garner
rd, in five frames. The Anfinson-Bert
rara combination swung into line
again in the fifth for an exact dupli
cate of their first inning sally, and
netted two more runs. This gave the
bankers four to our one. Patterson
decided to outwit the jinx and placed
a single over the keystone. Hecken
dorf took the cue and repeated the
process to right, scoring "Pat." Mit
chell didn't want to interrupt the
good work so he tapped another one
out, scoring "Lefty" with the third
Cardinal tally. Mitchell isn't a bit
hogish though, for he attempted sec
ond and took the count.
Draper trotted into the play with
his old soup-bone in the sixth and
ladled out seven straight strikeouts
to the money-lenders, the last gentle
man to take his medicine being the
aforementioned, apple-rapping Anfin
son. Kallam, Green, and Kline, breath
ed in some of the fumes from "Drap's"
magic tonic, and walloped the pellet
for two singles and a triple. Patter
son came up for his second hit and
when the dust of the travelers settled
the records showed six in the store
house for Seay's proteges.
This was the last offensive from
either front. The last two bankers
at the rubber popped into the trusty
milt of "Pat". On receiving the last
one he jammed the apple into his
pocket and made a dash for the dress
ing room. Six or seven of the Cards
gave chase and the next focus on them
showed the untangling process of a
general "Strangler" Lewis encounter.
The Cardinal diamond artists took
the heavy end of a 6 to 4 score when
they met the Federal Reserve Club
of San Francisco, on the local field
Saturday afternoon. Anfinson of the
visitors tried to upset all reasonable
calculations by swatting the sphere
for two home runs and a double. He
is a little man, but there is a recoil
in his swinging machinery which sends
the apple on a long journey.

Nef toed the slab for the home
team during the first five innings, and,
with the exception of Anfinson and
Bertram of the opposition, he had
little trouble in keeping the bases
clear. The first ball thrown looked
good to Anfinson and he drove it to
deep center for his first completed
journey. Bertram had the traveling
fever, too, and launched a long one
to left for two bases. The next two
entries look the count but Benn clip
ped a single to right, scoring Bert
ram, and giving the visitors two mark
ers to open the affray with. In the
second frame, "Mort" Kline, Cardinal
clean-up man, drove through the key
stone area for a single, and a passed
ball and some clever stealing gave us
a tally in spite of the one-two-three
count which followed Kline's swat.
