# RALLY IN FIFTH WINS DEKES GAME
## Six Run Avalanche in Last Period Puts Alpha Tau 0. Out of the Title Chance 
### 
A last inning rally which netted six
runs saved the Delta Kappa Epsilon nine
from defeat at the hands of Alpha Tau
Omega's diamond men in a close intra
mural contest Friday. The final score
was 11 to 6. Up to the fifth period,
both teams hit and fielded with about
equal success, there being few errors by
either side. When the eventual victors
came to bat in the first of the fifth,
Alpha Tau Omega was leadnig by one
tally. Several long hits off a new pitcher
and three costly errors by the outfield
spelled good luck for Delta Kappa Ep
silon. Half a dozen batters planted a
foot oil the home rubber before the third
out put a halt to the parade. This was
the only game staged Friday.

Chandler, D.K.E. catcher, rapped out
the first hit, which was a three-bagger.
Gillis drove him in with another swat
of equal denomination, thus scoring the
first run of the game. The Alpha Tan
batters got the number of Johnson, the
opposing slabster, in their first trip to
the plate, and hung up. three tallies on
two singles, a two-bagger, and a triple.
Both sides retired inglOriously in the
second by the one, two, .three path.
Gillis replaced Johnson on the mound.
In the third frame Delta Kappa Ep
silon found Sutton for a three-bag trip.
Chandler brought him in with a single,
and in turn scored on Gillis' hard drive
into the outer garden.
The A.T.O. varsity took the lead again
