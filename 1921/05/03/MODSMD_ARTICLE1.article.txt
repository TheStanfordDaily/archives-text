# "BELIEFS OF THE SHINTO COLT" IS LECTURE TOPIC
## William Leonard Schwartz of French Department to Talk Tonight in Little Theatre 
### 
William Leonard Schwartz of the
Romanic Languages department will
lecture in the Little Theater tonight
on "The Faith and Practices of Shinto
ism, the Japanese Tribal Religion;
with Recollections of a Pilgrimage to
the God of Marriage."
Mr. Schwartz will explain the his
tory of this faith and MQtne of its
mythology. Shinto is a tribal cult
baaed on nature worship and which
is more patriotic in its teachings than
ethical. It has *an old mythology
which explains the origins of the gods
and which makes the reigning family
in Japan descendants from these gods.
In modern times, Shintoism has be
come principally the worship of an
cestors and heroes of Japan. In order
that people of all faiths might worship
these heroes without conscientious ob
jections, an edict was issued in 1881
which deprived the ceremonies of
Shinto in the palace and at the shrines
of their religious nature. In spite of
this, however, many religious prac
tices continue to form a part of Shin
toism.
in the latter part of his lecture, Mr.
Schwarta will describe a pilgrimage
which he made to the shrine of the
God of Love and Marriage. At the
shrine he was a guest of the high
priest, and in this way he had better
opportunities to study the practices
of Shintoism than most foreigners
have.
The lecture will be illustrated with
fifty slides, some of which were color
ed in Japan and which were collected
by Mr. Schwartz when he lived in
that country. They will show the re
ligious ceremonies and practices in
the shrines and temples of Shinto,
temple dances and festivals, and pil
grims who visit the shrines.
Mr. Schwartz has spent most of his
life in Japan. He made a special
study of Shintoism which was pub
lished by the Asiatic Society of Japan
in 1913, under the title "The Great
Shrine of Idzumo: Some Notes on
Shinto, Ancient and Modern."
