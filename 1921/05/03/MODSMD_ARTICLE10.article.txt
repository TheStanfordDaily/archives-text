# 'THE UNITED STATES AS A WORLD POWER' IS SUBJECT OF TALK
## R. G. Gettel Shows Necessity For Accurate Knowledge of American-Foreign Policy 
### 
Stating that the youth of today,
especially our college students, who
will naturally become the leaders of
tomorrow, must acquaint themselves
with the all-important question of
"What shall be our foreign policy?"
Professor R. Q. Gettel in his lecture
last night on "The United States aB a
World Power," said:
"The foreign policy of the United
States is divided into three great
! periods. The first runs from Colonial
times to the Monroe Doctrine (1823),
the second to the Spanish-American
War (1898), and the third continuing
from that day to the present. The
first and third periods were character
ized by foreign entanglements which
demanded a solution. In colonial
times we were not in world politics
from choice, but because we were a
weak nation at the mercy of Europe.
We were isolated from Europe and
yet our large merchant marine made
us interested in world affairs."
In outlining the second great division
ne said that the United States de
voted all her effort to ( internal better
ment. In the development of her
natural resources she became a manu
facturing and industrial urban coun
try with finished goods to sell abroad.
"Therefore," continued Professor Get
tel, "with the development of business
relations, diplomatic and political re
lations will inevitably follow, for poli
tics will always deal with those things
which make up the lives of men."
Discussing the problems arising with
our acquirement of dependent and
scattered possessions, he analyzed our
part in the world-leagues and con
ferences, and our growth as a naval
power from a poor sixth to our pres
ent rank of second. With several
examples he showed how a centrally
located nation always becomes great
and as the United States is the only
state facing both oceans she is a
major center of the world.
Professor Gettel said he feared that
oui* country is becoming imperialistic.
