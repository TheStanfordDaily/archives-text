# KNIGHTS, LADIES OF ARTHUR'S DAY TO BE AT PROM
## Indirect Lighting Effect to Be Feature of Decorations; Special Orchestra to Play 
### 
King Arthur and the Knights of the
ound Table, accompanied by such
members of the fair sex as swayed the
hearts of these ancient heroes, will reign
supreme at the Junior Prom Friday
night. '
The king and his armored horde have
already besieged the hills back of the
campus and are preparing to surround
the floor of Encina Gymnasium and act
as chaperons at the Prom. King Arthur
and his various celebrities will form a
freeze along the side walls of the gym
nasium. The posters upon which these
medieval heroes will be displayed have
been loaned to the Junior class by the
San hrancisco Ad Club and must be re
turned in perfect condition after the
j|ance. Therefore the Prom committee
requests that the roughs refrain from in
any way mutilating them.
The ceiling will be in contrast to the
dull blues and greens of the posters.
The rafters of the basketball court will
be hidden from view by varying strips of
colors. Starting with deep purple at the
ends and ending with bright yellow in
the center, the ceiling bids fair to be a
riot of pigments. A novel method will
be employed in constructing the false
ceiling which the committee promises
will provide for the best ventilation pos
sible.
Â« The dance will be very dimly lighted
by thirty colored spot lights. Ten of
these will be used to light the ceiling
and the rest will be set on the floor.
The floor lights will radiate outward
from the inusie and from the side walls.
Ambrose Whitmer will furnish the
necessary harmony to make the dance a
success. He and his ten fellow synco
pators will be placed on a stand in the
center of the hall, from which they
promise to send forth the most ecstatic
symphonies that have ever swayed the
feet of campus terpsichoreans.
To crown the glorious evening the
class of 1922 will offer the lucky holders
of Prom tickets the most delectable
combination that can be produced by the
best cuisiniere in San Francisco. Salad,
chicken patties, topped by ice cream and
coffee, and the entire meal served by the
best waiters that can be imported, will
be the offering of Evelyn Johnston,
