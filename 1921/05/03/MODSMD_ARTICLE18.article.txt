# LOOK AROUND

### 
A usual student tendency in the hurry and confusion of a quarter's
work in studies and activity is to forget nearly everything but the work
(or play) at hand, to forget the general plan of college education. Al
most immediately on the beginning of each term work piles up and is
seldom cleared away before the last final examination, when the student
suddenly finds himself at the end of his rope. The situation then grad
ually clears up and he begins to plan anew.
Hundreds of students depart fqpm the University leaving unfulfilled
three-fourths of the expectations of a four year's life at college. The
reason is that at all times each thought he was loaded down with work,
and thought that sometime later he would be better able to get at
some of the plans which always lay back in his mind. The more favor
able time never came to any college student. Take the case of the fresh
man who plans to make his work less demanding of time next quarter in
order to try out for the Daily Palo Alto, athletics, or what not. The
work is never so arranged. Or there is the case of the man who for
three yeas planned to take a two days' vacation and hike over the hills
to the coast. He said yesterday that his work was getting harder again
and that he could not make the trip until next quarter.
The Daily does not propose to moralize, llut there are in the class
of 1921 many seniors who have left only a month to broaden their view
of Stanford, complete little plans and activities, wind up business and
prepare to leave the University. Juniors and sophomores who begin
now to look around and remember more of the reasons for their being
at Stanford than to do only the work which is pressing, will l>e wiser and
more satisfied as they approach the end of their last year.
