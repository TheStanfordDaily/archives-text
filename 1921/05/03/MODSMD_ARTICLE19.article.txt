# BOOTLEGGERS

### 
The Daily is glad to reprint the impression recorded by the San
Francisco Bulletin as. a result of the recent action of the Student
Council:
"Again the Students' Council at Stanford has demonstrated its
value in co-operating with the authorities in preserving the moral tone
of the University. Reports of bootlegging on the campus were investi
gated and it was found that two students were peddling moonshine.
The Council took immediate action and the offenders were expelled be
cause the student body believes the law should be upheld and refused
to tolerate law-breaking.
"The bootlegger is doubly dangerous: he is a menace in what he
sells and in the way he sells it. Many a young student that would not
think of going into a saloon, standing up to a bar or sneaking down a
side street may be tempted to partake of forbidden stufT served in the
room of a fellow student.
"This, however, is merely the practical side of the question. The
vital principle is expressed in the action of the student body in moving
for the expulsion of law-breakers. It proves that the Council is not
only protecting its own rights, but is doing all in its power to uphold
the morale and prestige of the University."
It is good to receive unexpected commendation in the perform
ance of mighty difficult duty.
