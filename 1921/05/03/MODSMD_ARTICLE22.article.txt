# Professor Tatlock Comes From Eastern Colleges With Praise for Stanford
## 
### 
John S. P. Tatlock, professor of Eng
lish philology, began his work here six
years ago and feels that Stanford is one
of the most interesting places in the
country. Jn his opinion the fact that it
is free from state control and the most
heavily endowed university west of Chi
cago places it in a position to be one of
the greatest institutions in the West.
He believes that the development of
Stanford for the present will be concen
trated in the departments which are here
now, with no attempt to branch out into
the side issues which a state university
must include; also that the growing in
terest and loyalty of the alumni will be
one of the important factors in future
development. He is confident that Cali
fornia's wealth and intelligence to
gether with that of many eastern people
who become interested should make
Stanford one of the most distinguished
colleges in America.
The summer quarter holds great in
terest for Professor Tatlock because it
offers the best opportunity for contact
with advanced students and it is lm be
lief that specialization in graduate work
helps to build up academic prestige. He
points to the fact that Chicago intro
duced the quarter system about twenty
years ago and for some reason the ex
ample was not followed. Then Stanford
started the system in 1918 and since that
time several other places have adopted
it. Within a few years Stanford should
draw students from the entire South
wesj for advanced work during the sum
mer quarter.
Professor Tatlock was born at Stam
ford, Connecticut, February 24, 1876,
and received his first education in its
public schools. In 1896, at the age of 20,
he took bis A.15. from Harvard, and in
1903 received his Ph.IX from there.
While at Harvard he served as assistant
in English in 1903. The years from 1903
to 1915 were given to the University of
Michigan, where he started as instructor
and received a full professorship in 1911
teaching several summers at Chicago
and Dartmouth. Since 1915 he has been
at Stanford, with the exception of war
work.
During the war Professor Tatlock
worked in three activities: In the early
part of 1918 lie did editorial work in
Washington, D. C\. for the Creel com
mittee which was concerned with public

information. In the summer of 1918 he
traveled over the western half of the
country on educational work for the
War Department, and during the fall
was associated with Dr. Wilbur and Dr.
J. M. Stillman in the work of the
S. A. T. C. in the five southwestern
states, which involved constant traveling.
Considering that Dr. Tatlock is a
scholar of medieval English and a man
who has spent a great deal oI time in
profound study and research work, it is
interesting to know that he is an outdoor
man and fond of the hardships encoun
tered in canoe trips. He has made sev
eral inland canoe voyages which have
taken him through the woods of Michi
gan and Canada. Another form of va
cation which he enjoys is to go to
Europe and divide his time between
study in the libraries of London and
Paris, and traveling on foot and other
wise through western Europe. The old
libraries there have a great appeal to him
for his paramount interest is in teaching
and writing, and they afford a wealth of
material for research work. Next fall
he will make his fiftli trip abroad, all of
them for the purpose of partial relaxa
tion and study.
He is a member o#the Modern Lan
guage Association of America, vice
president in 1914; Philological Associa
tion of the Pacific Coast, vice-president
1917-19, president 1920; American Asso
ciation of University Professors, mem
ber of the council 1919-22; Phi Beta
Kappa; Research Associate of the Car
negiqr Institute of Washington; member
of .Simplified Spelling Hoard. His
works include: Development and Chron
ology of Chaucer's works, 1907,
other books on Chaucer; also -an edition
of Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cres
sida"; The Modern Reader's Chaucer
(with Percy MacKaye), 1912, with the
collaboration of Mrs. Tatlock; Repre
sentative English Plays (with R. G.
Martin), 1916; and is a frequent con
tributor to philological and literary jour
nals.
At present Professor Tatlock, to
gether with Professor A. G. Kennedy,
lias nearly finished compiling a Chaucer
concordance, which will have taken two
and a half years to accomplish. It will
be the only one of its kind in existence
and will jjtrobably be in two large
volumes.

man and fond of the hardships encoun
tered in canoe trips. He has made sev
eral inland canoe voyages which have
taken him through the woods of Michi
gan and Canada. Another form of va
cation which he enjoys is to go to
Europe and divide his time between
study in the libraries of London and
Paris, and traveling on foot and other
wise through western Europe. The old
libraries there have a great appeal to him
for his paramount interest is in teaching
and writing, and they afford a wealth of
material for research work. Next fall
he will make his fiftli trip abroad, all of
them for the purpose of partial relaxa
tion and study.
He is a member o#the Modern Lan
guage Association of America, vice
president in 1914; Philological Associa
tion of the Pacific Coast, vice-president
1917-19, president 1920; American Asso
ciation of University Professors, mem
ber of the council 1919-22; Phi Beta
Kappa; Research Associate of the Car
negiqr Institute of Washington; member
of .Simplified Spelling Hoard. His
works include: Development and Chron
ology of Chaucer's works, 1907,
other books on Chaucer; also -an edition
of Shakespeare's "Troilus and Cres
sida"; The Modern Reader's Chaucer
(with Percy MacKaye), 1912, with the
collaboration of Mrs. Tatlock; Repre
sentative English Plays (with R. G.
Martin), 1916; and is a frequent con
tributor to philological and literary jour
nals.
At present Professor Tatlock, to
gether with Professor A. G. Kennedy,
lias nearly finished compiling a Chaucer
concordance, which will have taken two
and a half years to accomplish. It will
be the only one of its kind in existence
and will jjtrobably be in two large
volumes.
John S. P. Tatlock, professor of Eng
lish philology, began his work here six
years ago and feels that Stanford is one
of the most interesting places in the
country. Jn his opinion the fact that it
is free from state control and the most
heavily endowed university west of Chi
cago places it in a position to be one of
the greatest institutions in the West.
He believes that the development of
Stanford for the present will be concen
trated in the departments which are here
now, with no attempt to branch out into
the side issues which a state university
must include; also that the growing in
terest and loyalty of the alumni will be
one of the important factors in future
development. He is confident that Cali
fornia's wealth and intelligence to
gether with that of many eastern people
who become interested should make
Stanford one of the most distinguished
colleges in America.
The summer quarter holds great in
terest for Professor Tatlock because it
offers the best opportunity for contact
with advanced students and it is lm be
lief that specialization in graduate work
helps to build up academic prestige. He
points to the fact that Chicago intro
duced the quarter system about twenty
years ago and for some reason the ex
ample was not followed. Then Stanford
started the system in 1918 and since that
time several other places have adopted
it. Within a few years Stanford should
draw students from the entire South
wesj for advanced work during the sum
mer quarter.
Professor Tatlock was born at Stam
ford, Connecticut, February 24, 1876,
and received his first education in its
public schools. In 1896, at the age of 20,
he took bis A.15. from Harvard, and in
1903 received his Ph.IX from there.
While at Harvard he served as assistant
in English in 1903. The years from 1903
to 1915 were given to the University of
Michigan, where he started as instructor
and received a full professorship in 1911
teaching several summers at Chicago
and Dartmouth. Since 1915 he has been
at Stanford, with the exception of war
work.
During the war Professor Tatlock
worked in three activities: In the early
part of 1918 lie did editorial work in
Washington, D. C\. for the Creel com
mittee which was concerned with public

information. In the summer of 1918 he
traveled over the western half of the
country on educational work for the
War Department, and during the fall
was associated with Dr. Wilbur and Dr.
J. M. Stillman in the work of the
S. A. T. C. in the five southwestern
states, which involved constant traveling.
Considering that Dr. Tatlock is a
scholar of medieval English and a man
who has spent a great deal oI time in
profound study and research work, it is
interesting to know that he is an outdoor
man and fond of the hardships encoun
tered in canoe trips. He has made sev
eral inland canoe voyages which have
taken him through the woods of Michi
