Something to Look at
The Junior Opera this year will" be an
eye-full. Outside of the ca«t and the
Pony and Beauty choruses—all of whom
are restful to the eyes—the settings will
get more than passing notice.
Among other things, the curtains
bought with the proceeds from the
Denishawn entertainment will make
their initial appearance. When Ernie
Greppin gets his four spotlights turned
on them voti will agree that they are a
good investment, and then some. The
color effects he achieves are delightful.
Who's Who and How
Dealing in personalities—a dangerous
but popular pastime around a univer
sity—one might remark that Les Seib is
doing some good work on the coaching
end of the Opera. Les has personality,
pep and talent, a trio quite as valuable to
a dramatic coach as youth, health and
beauty are to a co-ed.
Backing him up is the old Roman,
Gordon Davis, whose clear head and
knowledge of dramatic technique have
helped to smooth off several rough spots.
Gordon is not actively engaged in the
coaching work but lie drops in to a re
hearsal every now and then and his sug
gestions are always given attention.
"From Everlasting to Everlasting"
According to H. G. Wells, the Bible is
becoming a back number and the British
essayist is having a great time figuring
out a substitute, which he calls "The
Bible of Civilization." He should have
said that it is becoming a back number
in spots because that part which says
"and they shall be born again" certainly
seems to lie still in good working order.
All of which is occasioned by the fact
that "The Birth of a Nation" has made
another re-birth and is appearing again
at the Capitol theater in New York. Put
out six years ago, it still ranks as the
greatest American spectacle ever pro
duced. When the "Birth" ceases to
make money Uncle Tom's Cabin shows
will be going bankrupt, choc-malts will
no longer be popular, and Stanford will
have abolished tuition.
