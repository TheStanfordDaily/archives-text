Kostooras! O, you Lulu, they've
sure gottem. Who? None of your
business. But say I'll just put you hep
on the Q.T. see? It's them korus
girls, the little ones and the big ones,
see? They have just about the vari
coloredest best looking little bunch of
seenery that you ever squinted at.
And novel, that don't express it at all.
The fellow that thought up that bunch
of glad rags must o' got his ideas
somers else than in this sordid at
mosphere. What they've got for ex
hibition backs off the map the powers
of description of our able friend who
tells 'em about the distinguished right
wing of one "Brick." Someone said
somethin' about complimentary colors.
Compliment them Jrainbow hufls if
you like, I'll do a little complimentin'
to the contents. Do tell as how there
hasn't ever been any such seen around
these parts in many many years.
Whoo! And that ain't all. Looks
like a prosperous year for the transit
men.
