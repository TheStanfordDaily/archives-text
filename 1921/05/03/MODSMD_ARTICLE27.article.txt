"Too Many Bleacher Athletes," is the
title of an article by Harry W. Maloney
in the May issue of the Illustrated Re
view, in which a review is made of the
Stanford athletic situation and remedies
for the correction of existing conditions
are offered. Maloney believes that too
many people doing the "let-George-do
it" act accounts to a large degree for the
present Cardinal athletic slump. "His
remedy is based on a study of Stanford
athletic history.
Several other articles of local interest
are included in this issue of the Review,
among them a story on alumni home
