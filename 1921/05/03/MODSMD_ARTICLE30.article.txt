## Mitchell lops Run-getters at Sixteen Scores; Peterson Gams Fifty-one Points 
### 
J Captain-elect George preen lias batted
| his way to the lead in the race for hat
ting honors of the Cardinal varsity.
Green continued to slug the California
pitchers in the final two games of the
j series and likewise did some murderous
| execution against the hurlers in the other
i (our games played since the last aver
j ages were computed. He has garnered
j sixteen safe swats in forty-five trips to
the rubber for the round average of
.355, a gain of twenty-two points over
his last mark.
Emery Mitchell is in second place
with an average of .318 for eighteen
games. Mitchell is leading the run
getters, having crossed the pentagon six
teen times. He did not fare so well in
the last six games and dropped off from
.333 to .318.
Most of the nine players slumped in
their hitting s'ince the last averages were
published and as a consequence there are
only two men over the much sought for
three hundred mark. However, the men
who were rated as secret hitters in the
last quotations have made some mighty
leaps so that the team average has been
raised eight points.
The most noticeable gain was made
hy Patterson, who does the first sacking
for Seay's nine. "Pat" batted upward
from .230 to .281 in the last six games,
for a gain of fifty-one points.
