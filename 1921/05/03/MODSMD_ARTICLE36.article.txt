# DR. H. D. GRAY SAYS MOLIERE GREATEST FRENCH DRAMATIST
## 
### 
"Moliere is the greatest of all French
dramatists and ranks with Shakespeare.
Cocrates and Ibsen, because to the end
of his career he remembered the funda- |
mental law of appeal to a real, living,
ordinary audience," said Dr. H. D. Gray
before the Renaissance Club, last night.
The primary force in Moliere's drama
is the Commedia dell' Arte of the Italian
school, Dr. Gray continued. It goes to
the very opposite extreme of the gor
geous and dignified productions of the
French classical drama which came to be
developed by Racine. The Italian drama
was done by typical and stock characters
as the stage had a certain set and defi
nite characteristic of its own. The drama
itself had an evolution of a fixed se
quence of dramatic types. In Italy, the
troupe grew up together like 3 gypsy
band, A boy was born into the corri
pany and played a part from the baby
up through the juvenile character, the
hero, the villain, the old man and finally,
in his old age, the doddering grand
father. The costume and the mask of
the actress at once indicated whether she
m columbine, or a heroine, or a
Punchinello.
This was the drama that Moliere in
herited, and which he was one of the
first to put in written form.
"Moliere had the one best, greatest,
sa( ]d?st preparation for a knowledge of
real life that any man can have—a if'e
mendous and unhappy love/' said Df.
Gray. "There were young girls in his
company whom he worshiped, idolized
and married, and spent the rest of his
life being jealous of. This jealousy runs
through all of his plays and it is plotted v
right out of hi 5 heart. His characters
arc human, They arc actual IttC'n and
women with human entoiteVis, joys and
sorrows* Mi* dfarria, however crude in
places, was always vital and interesting,
because he kept in touch with his
audience. It is his sheer ability to see
the comic and be profoundly human that
made him the great sympathizer and
realizer of life in its inconguity and to
see the real meaning underneath the
j sham and burlesque."
