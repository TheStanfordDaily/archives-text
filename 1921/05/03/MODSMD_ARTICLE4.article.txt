# Jewels in Junior Opera Put Pep in Sparkling Number
## 
### 
® Ah, here they come! Dainty <$>
<$> bits of shimmering loveliness borne <§>
<$> aloft on stalwart slaves. Fojur spot- <§>
lights play upon them as they step <$>
from their fragile cases and do <S>
<3> their quaint little dance. <§>
The Jewel number is here! ❖
Whirling, laughing, prancing, the <§•
<3> Jewel Girls dance in the mad moon- <$>
•5> light. The music ceases; they look ❖
bewildered, and hastily scamper <§■
<S> away. <$>
<3> Thus goes one of the feature ®
G> numbers of this year's Junior <$>
Opera. Four girls dressed in <S>
<§> special creations to represent Ruby, .<§>
<$> Diamond, Turquoise, and Emerald <£>
<§> will be brought on the stage in satin <$>
<$> jewel cases. Emerging from their
<«> caskets they sing the Jewel song <5>
and put into it all the sparkle that <?>
•t> the name implies.
3> It's a bear! $
