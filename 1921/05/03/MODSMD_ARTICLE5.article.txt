## Third Game of Spring Practice Series Will Be Fast; Nef, Gray or Knox Due to Start 
### 
The varsity nine will play the third
game of the spring practice series
against the Federal Telegraph team
of Palo Alto on the local diamond
next Saturday afternoon. The Feds
have been taking a large percentage
of'scalps this season and are expected
to give a good account of themselves.
Ringchop ia likely to take the mound
for the Telegraphers with O'Grady on
the receiving end. For the inner lot
they have Gibson at first, Jensen on
the pivot, Kleine in the third area,
and I. Harvie at short. The outfield
ers are Boudßon, H. Harvie, and
Yount.
Coach Seay will start Nef, Grey, or
Knox in the slab position for the Cards
with Bundy taking the throws. The
rest of the line-up will work the same
as in last Saturday's game. Patterson,
Mitchell, Heckendorf, and Kallam will
take their berths on the turfless area,
with Carver, Kline, and Green watch
ing the outposts.
The past record of the Feds and
the brand of ball which Seay's men
have delivered in recent contests are
indications of a fast game. The Cards
have steadied down and the erratic
bursts of the early season are subsid
ing to a consistent teamwork which
should give them the large end of the
scalps during the spring series. The
game is called at 3:00 p.m.
