# TEMPLETON'S TRACK MEN TO BATTLE OLYMPIC CLUB SATURDAY IN THIRD MEET
## 
### 
Coach Templeton will pit his cinder artists against the Winged-O team on
the Stanford Oval next Saturday afternoon for the third time this season, and
the dopesters foretell one of the hardest fought contests ever staged on the local
field. In the first meet the Olympics nosed out the Cards by a score of 66 to
65, and the results of the second encounter were an exact duplicate with Temple
ton's cohorts holding the heavy end. In the Saturday meet Coach Foster's com
bination is given a slight edge but not enough to dim the hopes of Card fans.
The Cardinal team will work in the same formation as in the Big Meet.
Two weeks of stiff practice have put the men in better shape than they were
against the Bruins. Captain Kirksey is in prime condition and is doped to
annex the heavy end of the counts in the furlong and 220-yard runs. Wells and

Williams are at their best and should
gi\e Norton a hard run in both hurdles.
Kenny Wright, captain-elect, made a
wonderful showing in the Big Meet, and
is expected to edge out Hayward, the
fast Winged-0 quarter miler.
