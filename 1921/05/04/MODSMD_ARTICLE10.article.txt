# ADVANCE QUAD SALE WILL END TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tomorrow concludes the three-day
campaign for the advance sale of 1922
Quads. Manager William H. Vosburgh
initiated the sale drive in order that
every member of the student body
would have a fair opportunity to pur
chase a volume of the limited edition.
The advance sales of the Quad
have been unusually heavy this year
so that only by an early subscrip
tion can the purchase of the year
book be assured. Less than 25 per
cent of the 1922 edition, 1300 copies,
remained unsold at the beginning of
the campaign Tuesday morning. Sub
scriptions the last two days have
further reduced this number, leaving
but a small fraction of the edition on
the market for sale.
Vosburgh announces that tomorrow
will be the last opportunity for the
ordering of leather-bound Quads. A
special edition of leather-bound year
books will be published next month, to
fill all orders received by not later
than tomorrow evening.
