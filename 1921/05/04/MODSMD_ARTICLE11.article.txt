# INTERCLASS SOCCER GAMES TO COME AS JUNIOR WEEK EVENT
## 
### 
The annual competition for the inter
class socccr championship will be one of
the events of Junior Week. The win
ning class team will be presented with a
Williamson plaque. Although the exact
time for the contests has not been set by
Captain Gorman of the varsity soccer
team, who is in charge, it is probable
that the contests will be run off on Sat
urday morning.
Instead of the usual eleven men, the
teams will be only five-a-sidc, and the
half periods will be shortened to 10 or
15 minutes. This will enable all the
games to be played on a single day, each
team being eliminated from the tourna
ment as soon as it is defeated.
With the organization of a holdover
team by "Bill" Adams, the number of
entries will be increased to five. The
holdovers, with Adams, Wing, Mead,
Robinson, and Newlands of last year's
varsity, are the favorites to win the
plaque, although any one of the class
teams may spring a surprise.
