# FOUR MEMBERS CHOSEN TO RENAISSANCE CLUB
## 
### 
At the last meeting of the Renais
sance Club, Monday evening in the
Women's Club House, four new mem
bers were elected: Miss Ida Noles,
Miss Vera Manners, Mr. William Huse,
'21, and Mr. Burrel Keck, *23.
Rehearsals are in progress for the
Club's next production, "Tartuffe," or
"The Hypocrite," by the greatest of
French dramatists, Moliere. This is
the most ambitious play the Renais
sance players have undertaken but
the popular nature of the comedy as
sures its success. The date and cast
will be announced shortly.
