# RAINBOW COLORING OF PROM HEIGHTENED BY UNIQUE LIGHTING
## 
### 
A doable rainbow lit by combinations
of twin spotlights from the floor will
be the decorative scheme for the Prom
on Saturday night. The rainbow will
run from the basic yellow in the center
to a deep blue at the terminations.
Against this the lights will be projected
with their complimentary colors. They
will be arranged in pairs and wil Ibc
focused to blend together so that the
gowns of the dancers will catch the hues
of both at the same time.
These colors will all be of those which
contrast most successfully with each
other, blue and orange, green and red,
and violet and yellow being put with
each other to Â£et Lhe desired effect. A
constant changing will result from the
moving throng which promises to be ex
ceedingly novel and beautiful in its
working.
