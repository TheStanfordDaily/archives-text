# A 						LINE ON THE FARM
## 
### 
"fie hands out a great line," suggests one student of the words of
some fellow toiler in search of the higher American education, meaning
|>erliaps that his classmate has given evidence of remarkably intelligent
thinking. Or he may mean that his comrade conceals well the fact that
lie has little or nothing with which to think.
In either case the line is an almost inalienable quality of the mixer
in student life. Like the wonderful Magnolia Balm of the old-time
medicine show, it is applied with <;qual success to all nature of fractures,
cuts, bruises, internal or external disorders in the fabric of campus
society. It is equally beneficial as a preventive of complications, and no
matter to what use applied never fails to aid campus characters in their
daily life.
The professor demands a good line when a student delays a mid
term report. The registrar must have a good one when some unfor
tunate forgets his syllabus fee. All must cultivate it to merit good
grades in real culture examinations, and the Dean of Men is the Uni
versity expert employed to be the receiving end of various lines of t-he
great campus peddlers.
The snake has his several lines to astonish his favorite charmer, and
the charmer needs her own to get away from some would-be rattler
leaving him with the impression that lie still rates a million. The "poli
tician" develops one to indicate how deeply he thinks of student welfare,
and the real "worker in student interest may need one to get his ideas over.
There can be 110 doubt that the line is a rcognized part of a college
education. Men with both brains and a line are deemed more able to
secure opportunity to put their brains to use. Those who have a line
and no brains may still qualify for great success by hiding the things
they do not know. Men without a line, brains or 110 brains, may be con
sidered rather hopeless contenders against the mighty wielders of this all
round weapon of thfc present-day world.
Yet, with all this it is rather refreshing today to meet the man or
woman who says : "Professor Square, I cut your eight o'clock because 1
was tired and slept through it" ; or just plain, "Oscar, you didn't — <*'
your line didn't —get by."

THE LABOR DAY COMMITTEE and the great number of students
who participated in the activities of yesterday afternoon are to be con
gratulated on the success of the day, both as a service enterprise and as
an associated student party. While we don't like to crab, we can't help
but feel that the success is hardly attributed to those few groups <>r
individuals who looked to their own little clean-up affairs first.

There can be 110 doubt that the line is a rcognized part of a college
education. Men with both brains and a line are deemed more able to
secure opportunity to put their brains to use. Those who have a line
and no brains may still qualify for great success by hiding the things
they do not know. Men without a line, brains or 110 brains, may be con
sidered rather hopeless contenders against the mighty wielders of this all
round weapon of thfc present-day world.
Yet, with all this it is rather refreshing today to meet the man or
woman who says : "Professor Square, I cut your eight o'clock because 1
was tired and slept through it" ; or just plain, "Oscar, you didn't — <*'
your line didn't —get by."

THE LABOR DAY COMMITTEE and the great number of students
who participated in the activities of yesterday afternoon are to be con
gratulated on the success of the day, both as a service enterprise and as
an associated student party. While we don't like to crab, we can't help
but feel that the success is hardly attributed to those few groups <>r
individuals who looked to their own little clean-up affairs first.
