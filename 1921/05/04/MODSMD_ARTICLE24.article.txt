# CABBAGES AND THINGS
## 
### 
One of the sadest cases we've heard
of recently is the suit of a widow for
damages approximating $50,000, in ;
compensation for her husband's death, j
It appears, according to newspaper I
reports, that the deceased was on a
street car which collided with an
automobile "and had his etaoin shrdlu
cmfwyp crushed in." An injury like!
that is worth any amount of money I
one could name. i

We delight in giving people credit!
for ability to make satirical cracks at
things that need them. The best ex-1
ample of the day was in yesterday's j
Safety Valve in the "Chronicle." "Sir,"'
it read, "Eureka! The light at the;
Public Library can be improved by
carefully washing the globes. L. M
Young, M. D."

We admit that Cabbages are awful,;
but there are those who declare the
weiner-wurst.

A city paper let a mean oik; slip:
through the other day when it said,;
"John So-and-So a colored porter, was
walking along Market Street last!
Friday, when a brick fell off a build- i
ing and struck him on the head, j
Neither object- was injured." And it !
wasn't in the humor column.

An eastern sport sheet says Stan-,
ford is lucky to get third place in the
Pacific Coast Conference in basket-1
ball. By the time news of victory
crosses a continent, it certainly de-!
generates into a stirring defeat. We
expect to learn one of these days of
our victory over Cal. in 1921 track. ;

Among the things that make rumor
unreliable are reports to the effect .
that "Pally street car fare is going
down to a nickle." "No more flunk
ing out of athletes"; "Stanford stadi
um will be built by student subscrip
tion"; "500 iu Stanford riot, 3 injured,
1 may die (first thought to apply to
co-ed war)", and "six Stanford men
to attend I. C. 4-A." In fact the«e are
reports that make humor out of rumor.

"God helps those who help them-!
selves." What can we want with an '
honor system?
