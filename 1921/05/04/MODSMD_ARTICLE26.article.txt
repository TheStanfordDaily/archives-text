# OPERA HIGH LIGHTS

### W. C. Evans, '22 
Mary Lee's a Heart Breaker
"Mary Lee," sung by Phil Richards
is the heart winner of the Opera. Per-
feet in its harmony, and with strangely
beautiful theme, it strikes a chord in
the soul that compels response to its
plea. One cannot help but be swayed
Iby the of its melody. In com
pany with the song are "Nate" and his
alto "phone" and Dorothy Woodhead
with her violin. They have a combina-
tion on the number that is home run
from the word go. The composition
is by Ambrose Whitmer, worded by
Dan Evans.

The most spontaneous laugh-getters
are the Wisnom-Hard combination.
They are the announcers of the show,
and their little feature imposed at
different time in the action, tends to
i keep up a spirit of levity that can
not be downed. Versatility is their
middle-name. They take the parts of
pages, oriental lackey boys, and the
common garden variety of United
States bell hop and do them all in
a manner that is not only uncom
mon but remarkable. Alike as two of
the Gold Dust twins their actions are
absolutely synchronized until they
move as two miniature automatons.
What they do in their various appear
ances is side-splitting. Incidentally
they furnish perfect keys to the plot
as the play advances.
I Love to Hear the Story
"Tell Me That You Love Me." is
he sentimental number sung by Fred
Hughes as Tipu the seductive Sultan
of Sedan. The plaint is to his mate,
the favorite of his harem. With a
' background of eastern colors his melo
dy is wonderfully adapted to the
theme, and it is not weakened any in
his interpretation.
Eureka! A New Edison
; Edison may have invented the in
' candescent lamp; Marconi the wire
less. and Aleck Bell the dictaphone,
but none of them ever had the in-
spiration that has brought Ernest
Greppin's lighting effects to the state
of perfection in which they exist. His
direction is that of a master, and there
is not a moment in the action where
there is not an unconscious appeal to
the beautiful in one's soul. His work
with the arcs and spots is a play in
itself, making easy the response of
the mind to the scenes as they come.
The hues and what they depict in
mute appeal are as much a program
as the silent interpretations of the
classical dancer.
A Home For Trouble
Hawtey Mertz pours out his plans of
his conception of an ideal little love
nest for just a pair of birdies, or bird
heads, to Melba Berry, his lady love.
He is Tubby the warm-hearted young
gent who flits in and out of the plot
lending a spirituous warmth to it in
the doing. Melba is Thea his heart-
breaker and enamorante. Their song
hit is "Our Little Bungalow," where
the action above takes place. The
! composition is catching in itself, hav
ing a fetching little tune and luring
lines which are brought out in good
shape by the genial Hawley.

of Sedan. The plaint is to his mate,
the favorite of his harem. With a
' background of eastern colors his melo
dy is wonderfully adapted to the
theme, and it is not weakened any in
his interpretation.
Eureka! A New Edison
; Edison may have invented the in
' candescent lamp; Marconi the wire
less. and Aleck Bell the dictaphone,
but none of them ever had the in-
spiration that has brought Ernest
Greppin's lighting effects to the state
of perfection in which they exist. His
direction is that of a master, and there
is not a moment in the action where
there is not an unconscious appeal to
the beautiful in one's soul. His work
with the arcs and spots is a play in
itself, making easy the response of
the mind to the scenes as they come.
The hues and what they depict in
mute appeal are as much a program
as the silent interpretations of the
classical dancer.
A Home For Trouble
Hawtey Mertz pours out his plans of
his conception of an ideal little love
nest for just a pair of birdies, or bird
heads, to Melba Berry, his lady love.
He is Tubby the warm-hearted young
gent who flits in and out of the plot
lending a spirituous warmth to it in
the doing. Melba is Thea his heart-
breaker and enamorante. Their song
hit is "Our Little Bungalow," where
the action above takes place. The
! composition is catching in itself, hav
ing a fetching little tune and luring
lines which are brought out in good
shape by the genial Hawley.
Mary Lee's a Heart Breaker
"Mary Lee," sung by Phil Richards
is the heart winner of the Opera. Per-
feet in its harmony, and with strangely
beautiful theme, it strikes a chord in
the soul that compels response to its
plea. One cannot help but be swayed
Iby the of its melody. In com
pany with the song are "Nate" and his
alto "phone" and Dorothy Woodhead
with her violin. They have a combina-
tion on the number that is home run
from the word go. The composition
is by Ambrose Whitmer, worded by
Dan Evans.

The most spontaneous laugh-getters
are the Wisnom-Hard combination.
They are the announcers of the show,
and their little feature imposed at
different time in the action, tends to
i keep up a spirit of levity that can
not be downed. Versatility is their
middle-name. They take the parts of
pages, oriental lackey boys, and the
common garden variety of United
States bell hop and do them all in
a manner that is not only uncom
mon but remarkable. Alike as two of
the Gold Dust twins their actions are
absolutely synchronized until they
move as two miniature automatons.
What they do in their various appear
ances is side-splitting. Incidentally
they furnish perfect keys to the plot
as the play advances.
I Love to Hear the Story
"Tell Me That You Love Me." is
he sentimental number sung by Fred
Hughes as Tipu the seductive Sultan
of Sedan. The plaint is to his mate,
the favorite of his harem. With a
' background of eastern colors his melo
dy is wonderfully adapted to the
theme, and it is not weakened any in
his interpretation.
