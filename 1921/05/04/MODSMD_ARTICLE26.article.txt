Mary Lee's a Heart Breaker
"Mary Lee," sung by Phil Richards
is the heart winner of the Opera. Per-
I feet in its harmony, and with strangely
j beautiful theme, it strikes a chord in
1 the soul that compels response to its
i plea. One cannot help but be swayed
Iby the of its melody. In com
pany with the song are "Nate" and his
alto "phone" and Dorothy Woodhead
I with her violin. They have a combina-
I tion 011 the number that is home run
from the word go. The composition
is by Ambrose Whitmer, worded by
; Dan Evans.
Enter the Pages
The most spontaneous laugh-getters
1 are the Wisnom-llard combination.
They are the announcers of the show,
nnil their little feature imposed at
' different time in the action, tends to
i keep up a spirit of levity that can
not be downed. Versatility is their
j middle-name. They take the parts of
! pages, oriental lackey boys, and the
j common garden variety of United
j States bell hop .and do them all in
a manner that is not only uncom
mon but remarkable. Alike as two of
j the Gold Dust twins their actions are
j absolutely synchronized until they
move as two miniature automatons.
What they do in their various appear
j ances is side-splitting. Incidentally
they furnish perfect keys to the plot
as the play advances.
I Love to Hear the Story
"Tell Mo That You Love Me." is
j the sentimental number sung by Fred
j Hughes as Tipu the seductive Sultan
of Sedan. The plaint is to his mate,
the favorite of his harem. With a
' background of eastern colors his melo
?dy is wonderfully adapted to the
i theme, and it is not weakened any in
1 his interpretation.
Eureka! A New Edison
; Edison may have invented the in
' candescent lamp; Marconi the wire
less. and Aleck Bell the dictaphone,
but none of them ever had the in-
I spiration that has brought Ernest
Greppin's lighting effects to the state
of perfection in which they exist. His
direction is that of a master, and there
is not a moment in the action where
J there is not an unconscious appeal to
the beautiful in one's soul. His work
with the arcs and spots is a play in
j itself, making easy the response of
! the mind to the scenes as they come.
The hues and what they depict in
1 mute appeal are as much a program
as the silent interpretations of the
classical dancer.
| A Home For Trouble
Hawtey Mertz pours out his plans of
his conception of an ideal little love
nest for just a pair of birdies, or bird
heads, to Melba Berry, his lady love.
He is Tifbby the warm-hearted young
gent who flits in and out of the plot
I lending a spirituous warmth to it in
| the doing. Melba is Then hi* heart-
I breaker and enamorante. Their song
' hit is "Our Little Bungalow," where
! the action above takes place. The
! composition is catching in itself, hav
! Ing a fetching little tune and luring
lines which are brought out in good
shape by the genial Hawley.
