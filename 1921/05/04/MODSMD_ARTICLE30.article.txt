# BIZARRE LIGHTING DRAWS INTEREST TO THIRD-YEAR FROLIC
## 
### 
Bizarre effects resulting from unique
lighting are present all the time in the
scenic arrangement of this year's opera.
There is constant change from one hue
I to another throughout the whole of the
I performance. The plot furnishes much
I chance to give variety in the various
colors and every bit of this has been
fully taken advantage of by the corps
of trained stage electricians. There is
no time during the action of the play
that the lighting scheme does not co
incide with the theme in harmonious co
operation.
To get the desired effect a battery of
"spots" have been placed around the rim
of the gallery in the assembly an<l each
will be under the control of a certain
man. The whole system is to be con
trolled by one central station under
Ernest Greppin, '24. His orders will be
given by telephone to the various opera
tors, enabling the changing of the many
lights at one time. The results obtained
by throwing the different hues on the
drapes at the back 'are never the same
and give a tone to the show that helps
vastly in putting it over in the successful
way it promises.
