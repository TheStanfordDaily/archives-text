## 
### 
Tonight the whole of the Junior
Opera will be thrown for the first
time en comtume. The action is prac

ing up, and the complete play will
be run off from the opening of the
prologue to the laat curtain. This
rehearsal will not be open to any of
the public.
All the costumes and lighting ar
rangements have been completed
now, so that the show can be run off
without any hitches. The settings for
the third act that have been held up
are finished and form a back to the
stage that is one of the prettiest
pieces of interior decoration that has
ever been shown here. Minute at

getting the correct colorings for the
hangings and drapes and the whole
blends perfectly with the action as
it is carried along.
Nearly the entire house has been
sold in advance. The first rush yes

the down stairs, and but few seats
are left for the late comers. These
will be sold in the next two days,
and then any extras turned in will
