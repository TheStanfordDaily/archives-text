# JAPANESE SHINTO CULT EXPLAINED
## Practice of Tribal Religion Will Continue For Some Years, Says W. L. Schwartz 
### 
An illustrated lecture on "The Faith
and Practices of Shintoism, the Japa
nese Tribal Religion," given by William
Leonard Schwartz in the Little Theater
last night proved an interesting revela
tion of a decaying religion and myth
ology of the Japanese people.
Shintoism is no longer a religion of
the Japanese, but a series of ceremonies
to keep in mind the heroes and ancestors
of Japan, according to Schwartz*- It is
a belief closely related to Buddhism,
which continued in Japan up to the nine
teenth century; but it cannot be said to
be a faith of modern times. "It is easy
to understand," said Schwartz, "why
their people could fall into such a belief,
because Japan is essentially a feudal
country ruled by feudal princes.
"The Shinto order itself makes no de
mands upon the believers," continued
Schwartz. "They have no Sunday wor
ship, nor are they even required to pray,
for all these ceremonies are performed
for them by the Emperor and priests.
Worship at pny shrine is also entirely
voluntary. If an individual wishes to
wash his sins away, he goes to the
temple, washes out his mouth so as to
be pure, and repeats many times a short
prayer, clapping his hands all the while.

consist of rice-wine, rice, fresh fish and
salt-water fish, sea-weed, and last of all,
chopsticks. The priests carry the sacri
fices into the Holy of Holies to the
gods. It is a tradition that all the eight
hundred gods hold a conference during
the month of October as guests of the
head god, where they arrange for the
happiness and prosperity of their pa
rishioners for the ensuing year."
Pilgrimages are a common form of
worship, said Schwartz. Pilgrim clubs
arc organized, and by a process of lot
tery a few lucky members are sent on
long journeys to their sacred mountains.
They also have invented funeral and
wedding ceremonies of fantastical nature
in an endeavor to outdo the Christians-
Upon the death of the Emperor, they
