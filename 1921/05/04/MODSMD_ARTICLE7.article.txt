# SECOND LABOR DAY IS OBSERVED BY STUDENTS
## Half-Holiday Spent by Men and Women in Cleaning Up Grounds Of Stanford Convalescent Home 
### 
Work, "eats," and entertainment were
the salient features in the celebration of
Stanford's second annual Labor Day.
From the first swing of the hoe until the
last weary worker had departed in the
gathering dusk, the spirit of the occasion
was one of cheerful labor in a worthy
cause. Six hundred overalled students
gathered at the old Stanford residence
to carry on the work of beautifying the
grounds and aiding the children of the
Convalescent Home, at 1:30 yesterday.
The three acres about the Home were
the scene of industrious activity. In
one part a miniature logging camp was
in full blast, where two trees which had
become a menace to the children were
felled and cut into firewood. Another
corner was the picture of rural life, the
hay which was cut being raked into
shocks and taken away by the erstwhile
farmers. The co-workers had charge
of the renovation of the old Stanford
garden, the rakes and hoes in feminine
hands putting the plot in excellent con
dition. Detachments of men cleaned up
the roads, raked the grass, gathered up
the debris, and cleaned the interior of
the house. Trucks and wagons carried
innumerable loads of rubbish to San
Francisquito gulch. Amid this beehive
of activitiy the strains of the Stanford
Band spurred willing arms to greater
tasks, and cool drafts of lemonade re
freshed parched throats.
At 5 :30 the call to "chow" was sound
ed, and labors were abandoned in favor
of the repast prepared by Sam Mc-
Donald and his cohorts. Sheep barbe
cued in southern style by the foremost
exponent of the art, sandwiches pre
pared by the women of the sororities,
beans and delicious coffee served by the
women of Roble, and ice cream, com

prvstd the feast. The committee in
charge made it a point to see that there
was plenty for all, and "seconds" were
in order.
"We are here for three objects," stated
Dr. Gardner, Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the Convalescent Home, in
opening the evening's festivities. "First,
to reverence the ground made sacred by
the founders of the University, where
wc are today carrying on the work
started by the Stanford family. Second,
we are doing a work of thanksgiving,
expressing in some measure our grate
fulness for the advantages offered us.
Finally, it is an act of charity, an effort
to brighten the lives of the children
cared for here."
Dr. Gardner added to his reputation as
a friend of the students by passing out
cigarettes and candy at the conclusion
of his address.
The entertainment was started off by
Roble Hall, who presented a historical
revue, "The Evolution of the Co-ed."
The part of the Girl of 1899 was taken
by Alice Dement, the Girl of 1905 by
Edna Hawkins,* the Girl of 1910 by
Dorothy Grant, the Girl of 1915 by Julia
Spears, the Girl of 1920 by Leona
Mayer, and the Girl of the Future by
Mabel Jones. The roughs awarded the
prize to the Future's entry.
Jack Heffernan offered several of his
campuÂ§ hits, with Lloyd Howard at the
piano. "Tillie, Get to Work," "I'm Going
to Do It," and "Silver Dollar Lady"
were included. The program was con
cludoti by a highland fling by Mary
Sloan.
The work of the Labor Day commit
tee, under the direction of C. J. Tauzer,
chairman, was managed with a care for
details which bids fair to establish a
record for efficent work in this line.
