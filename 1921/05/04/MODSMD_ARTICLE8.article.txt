# MAY HOLD SWIMMING MEET WITH STOCKTON CLUB AT EARLY DATE
## 
### 
Varsity swimming plans are still in
abeyance pending the outcome of the
negotiations now being carried on with
the Neptune Swimming Club of Stock
ton, by which it is hoped to secure a
meet in the near future.
The Stockton Club is expected to
be heard from soon regarding the de
finite date for the meet. It is prob
able that Stanford will invade Stock
ton instead of having the contest here
or at the Olympic Club tank in San
Francisco, as has been done for all
previous meets this season.
The freshman swimming schedule
is nearing its end. The team meets
a squad from San Jose tomorrow aft
ernoon in Encina Pool. This meet may
be the last one of the freshman sea
son, the climax of which was reached
with the California battle of ten days
ago.
The San Jose team has not yet sent
in its list of entries but from previ
ous performances it is expected that
the freßhmen will win. There will
probably be some special events, such
as the 25-yard swim, in which San
Jose is especially Btrong, thus giving
them an edge in that way. But in the
regulation events the freshmen look
like winners.
