XJf OW wonderful to realize that about your cor- r
11 set! To be sure that you have at last found H
g the RIGHT corset! From the first time you \ S H
put on your American Lady corset, you know that "■;**§ S
S it is different from others you have worn. But per- W [j \ g
haps you may not realize at once HOW different. / S
jg Only when you see, after a perfect AGE of wear, |l f / §
how wonderfully your American Lady corset still / / J
keeps this first perfect smartness, will you discover @ / g
S what a great difference there is in the marvelously JpL a
S flexible boning—Mightybone—that keeps every /ilPlSl §
American Lady corset, even after the longest time, " '.W-- S
ja as smart as when you first put it on. —-33 ~ x «]
