# TRACK ARTISTS MEET OLYMPICS HERE SATURDAY
## Stanford May Enter Three or Six Man-team in I. C. 4-A Meet at Boston, May 27-28 
### 
Coach Templeton has his squad in
top-notch condition for the clash with
the Olympic Club trackmen, on the
Stanford Oval, next Saturday after,
noon. This Is the third meet between
the Cardinal and the Winged O this
season, and as the other two were
split even with a score of 66 to 65
in both meets, it is doped that Sat
urday's contest will be close with
several events hanging in the air un
til the finale.
Captain Kirksey should have little
trouble in annexing the furlong and
the 220-yard runs. Eddie Sudden is
donning an Olympic jersey and should
take second in these events, as he has
been making a wonderful showing all
season. Bob Williams and Jess Wells
have been keeping in prime condition
in preparation for the proposed trip
east and may between them take both
hurdle events from Johnny Norton,
former Stanford hurdler, and Olympic
Game runner. Williams is doped to
take the high hurdles and if Wells
is in his old-time form he will win
from Norton in the low event.
Captain-elect itenny Wright should
win an easy first in the quarter, with
Bob Wright nosing out Hayward of
the Olympics for second. Stanford
will have little chance in the distance
events for the Forward-Hunter com
bination of the Winged O are doped
to take the mile, and Hunter has the
edge on Eddleman in the two-mile.
Nothing definite has been settled in
regard to the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet
at Boston, May 27-28, but it is al
most certain that Coach Templeton
will be able to send east, at least a
three-man team. Captain Kirksgy,
Bob Williams, and Lane Falk are
slated to go and there is strong
probability of Wells and Wilcox going
if they can arrange their class work.
Kenny Wright is also having a dif
ficult time in fixing up his courses for
the absence and there is just a pos
sibility that he will make the last
unit of a six-man team. Flint Hanner
will be kept out of the meet this year
as the javelin will not be in the events.
It has recently been voted in as one
of the field events of the I. C. A. A.
A. A., but the change does not take
effect until next season.
