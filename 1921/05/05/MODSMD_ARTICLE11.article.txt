# UNIQUE PLANS MADE FOR PROM
## Unusual Scheme is Worked Out for Decorations and Lights; Knights as Patrons 
### 
Programs for the Junior Prom will be
ready for distribution tomorrow morn
ing at the Bookstore. It had been orig
inally planned to have them ready this
mdrning, but the San Francisco printers
declared a strike and, as usual, the inno
cent bystander must suffer.
These dance memo books are the
product of Walter Gores' ('18) work.
The cover is in keeping with the
medieval scheme of decoration. It
represents a knight in full armor riding
to take part in the lists. The lettering
and wording of the inside of the pro
gram still further reflect the days of
chivalry.

Gores Supervises Decoration
Walter Gores will be on the campus
this evening and all day tomorrow to
supervise the work of decorating En
cina Gymnasium. The Prom committee
urges that all juniors, men and women,
be on hand to assist in the work 'fof,
transforming the gymnasium into an
ancient list.
Although the junior class has suc
ceeded in establishing several new prece
dents in connection with Junior Week, J
as the complete sale of Prom tickets ten
days before the dance, it will not com
pletely overthrow campus customs. As
ii» previous years, flowers arc prohibited
at the Prom- The committee requests
that any over-zealous queeners save their
money, and also save themselves, their
ladies, and the committee considerable
embarrassment.
Admission by Ticket Only
Admission to the Prom will be gained
onfy- on the presentation of tickets. Peo
ple having programs and no tickets will
not Ijt let past the doors. The little
white pasteboard ticket only will admit
a couple to the dancc floor. Several of
•the campus huskies have been drafted
into the police service and will see that
j this provision is strictly enforced.
