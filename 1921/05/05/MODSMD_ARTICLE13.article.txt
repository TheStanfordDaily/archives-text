# STUDENTS HEAR ORGANIST GIVE VARIED PROGRAM
## Memorial Church Is Scene of Musical Recital Presented Before General Assembly 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
The Memorial Church formed an in
spiring background for a most interest
ing recital given in the student as
sembly held there at 11 o'clock this
morning. Hugo Goodwin, organist,
and Douglas Smith, the youthful sop
rano, w.ho assisted him, presented a
joint program comprehensive in range
and artistically complete as to details
of technique and interpretation.
There is an indefinable appeal about
the tones of an organ. It is at once
capable of the most delicate notes anh
of tremendous volumes of tone. Mr.
Goodwin has all resources at his finger
tips and is a master of artistic skill.
For the most part bis program con
sisted of light, graceful numbers, but
in Bonnet's "Variations" and the final
number, a "Toccata in F," by Widor,
his interpretation was vigorous and
profoundly moving.
Added to the effect produced by the
( combined beauty of the Church and
s the organ music were the songs sung
by Douglas Smith. These were all
religious in character, and sung with
all the charm suggestive of the boy
chorister. Combined with a clear con
vincing voice, well placed, and smooth
in production, Master Smith possesses
: certain mature methods of expression
above the ordinary standards.
Of Goodwin's numbers, perhaps the
moßt interesting were the "Toccata in
E" of the first group and the final
number of the program, Widor'B "Toe
cata in F." The toccata, always ef
fective on the organ, was particularly
interesting in that the two numbers
played this morning represented two
extremes of treatment, showing the
organist at home in each. The first
toccata was light, ingenious and full
of graceful fancies. The second con
tained rapid climaxes executed 'with
faultless technique.
Rachmaninoff's "Serenade" was ex
pressive of the Russian geniuer, and
played with a thorough understanding
of Rachmaninoff's work. "Told by the
Campfire," an original composition by
Goodwin, was filled with poetic ima
gery and pleasing harmony.
"Boyhood," appealing in its simpli
city of theme and melody, was the first
~song by Douglas Smith. This was
sung with an ingenious appeal which
was both delightful and satisfying. "O
Lord Most Holy." his second number',
was a test of the young artist's con
control ' and ability, and in this he
showed a thorough understanding of
him music and a knowledge of horn to
communicate it.
"Sweet Story of Old" and "A Legend
of the Robin and the Master," Master
Douglas' second group of songs, were
thoroughly enjoyable both from the
standpoint of subject and interpreta
tion.

sembly held there at 11 o'clock this
morning. Hugo Goodwin, organist,
and Douglas Smith, the youthful sop
rano, w.ho assisted him, presented a
joint program comprehensive in range
and artistically complete as to details
of technique and interpretation.
There is an indefinable appeal about
the tones of an organ. It is at once
capable of the most delicate notes anh
of tremendous volumes of tone. Mr.
Goodwin has all resources at his finger
tips and is a master of artistic skill.
For the most part bis program con
sisted of light, graceful numbers, but
in Bonnet's "Variations" and the final
number, a "Toccata in F," by Widor,
his interpretation was vigorous and
profoundly moving.
Added to the effect produced by the
( combined beauty of the Church and
s the organ music were the songs sung
by Douglas Smith. These were all
religious in character, and sung with
all the charm suggestive of the boy
chorister. Combined with a clear con
vincing voice, well placed, and smooth
in production, Master Smith possesses
: certain mature methods of expression
above the ordinary standards.
Of Goodwin's numbers, perhaps the
moßt interesting were the "Toccata in
E" of the first group and the final
number of the program, Widor'B "Toe
cata in F." The toccata, always ef
fective on the organ, was particularly
interesting in that the two numbers
played this morning represented two
extremes of treatment, showing the
organist at home in each. The first
toccata was light, ingenious and full
of graceful fancies. The second con
tained rapid climaxes executed 'with
faultless technique.
Rachmaninoff's "Serenade" was ex
pressive of the Russian geniuer, and
played with a thorough understanding
of Rachmaninoff's work. "Told by the
Campfire," an original composition by
Goodwin, was filled with poetic ima
gery and pleasing harmony.
"Boyhood," appealing in its simpli
city of theme and melody, was the first
~song by Douglas Smith. This was
sung with an ingenious appeal which
was both delightful and satisfying. "O
Lord Most Holy." his second number',
was a test of the young artist's con
control ' and ability, and in this he
showed a thorough understanding of
him music and a knowledge of horn to
communicate it.
"Sweet Story of Old" and "A Legend
of the Robin and the Master," Master
Douglas' second group of songs, were
thoroughly enjoyable both from the
standpoint of subject and interpreta
tion.
