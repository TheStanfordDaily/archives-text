"Little Jimmy Godfrey, aged 13, climbed a tree —out in Kansas
C-ity gather walnuts. He came in contact with an electric wire.
One side of his face was burned, leaving an ugly scar. A damage suit
was instituted against the power company on Jimmy's behalf. The
chief element of damage about which the claim centered was that Jimmy
had lost his youthful smile. On the witness stand Jimmy was asked to
try to smile. The only result was a puckering of the lips and a melan
choly drawing of the face. A physician testified that the smile muscle in
his cheek had been bound by the scarred tissued above. The jury
promptly returned a verdict, giving Jimmy $20,0 CX). That Incomes the
officially fixed value of a smile.—Grand Rapids Herald.
Are all smile muscles worth that amount?
One of the things which make a university life worth living is the
fifelike cheerful attitude which is most compatible with serious accom
plishment. The professor who carries this atmosphere into the class
room is, we believe, the one who gets the best reaction from his students.
Yet there arc among us instructors who, as far as we know in our four
years here, have not smiled yet, and there are students who already have
the burden of the world on their shoulders'.
A university education should increase, and not depreciate, the value
of a smile.
