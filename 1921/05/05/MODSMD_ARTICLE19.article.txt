# Freshman Swimmers to Meet San Jose Today
## 
### 
The freshman swimming meet with
San Jose Higli School was not held'
yesterday on account of bad weather
conditions, and is instead being staged
this afternoon. The twenty-four men
are due to easily defeat their opponents,
even though special events which have
been added may give San Jose a better
chance.
Whether or not this meet will be the
last of the present freshman season has
not been decided, but from all indica
tions it will. Games with high schools
have usually been scheduled as a method
of training for the meet with California,
and now that the Bruin contest is over,
there is not much need for a further ex
tensive schedule.
