## 
### 
Tentative plans for the annual intra
mural pentathlon were adopted at the
meeting of representatives of the vari
ous campus living groups held in the
Men's Union last night. Throughout the
discussion of plans, emphasis was laid
on the necessity of discovering new
varsity track material and on the de
sirability of getting a large number out
for the intramural meet. The date for
the event has not yet been decided on,
but it will be held sometime during May
and will probably cover a thrfce-day
period.
It was decided to include the follow
ing events in the meet: the 100-yard
dash, the shot put, the running broad
jump, the 120-yard low hurdles, and the
half mile. The half was favored over
the mile because it was thought that it
would be less strenuous for men not in
training. All men who were on the
squads of the varsity or freshman track
teams will be ineligible for the meet, as
it will be left to the discretion of the
coach as to who shall he regarded as
having been on the squads. Varsity let
ter men will officiate at the meet, acting
as judges of the various events.
The scoring system used in last year's
meet will be employed. It is a modified
form of the point system. In the case
of the 100-yard dash, for example, 10
seconds is counted at 1000 per cent, and
other times arc given a proportionate
percentage. A plaque will be given the
organization winning the meet, and some
form of award will be made the indi
vidual? winners of the various events.
