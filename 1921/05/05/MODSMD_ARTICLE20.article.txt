For some reason or other people
are beginning to think that this is a j
"Gentle Hint" column, judging by the
communications received. We are
daily questioned with regard to vari
ous affairs via the main route (not
R.F.D.) and have decided to publish
answers to save postage stamps since
the Daily ain't off the rocks yet.

"Dear Ed: —I am followed by an un-j
known man. I think an admirer, every j
evening on my way to the Library. |
He tries to manouver for position in
order to look at my face. Please tell'
me what to do. How can I avoid him. j

"Cabbages, Sir :—I was told before j
coming to this here institution that
your books was safe laying around j
everywhere. I left mine on a window '
sill on the Quad the other day and j
ain't seen 'em since. How will 1 get
my lessons without books? Irish
Major.

Do you still possess the use of your
hands?

Dear Ed: —Is there an epidemic of
the going-deaf sickness raging on the
campus? I haven't been able to hear
well for the past year. What's the

We heard someone say on the Econ j
steps this morning that a certain prof, j
was going away a week before the j
end of the quarter. Another gent, who j
had flunked a couple of preliminary \
exes under that prof, remarked that j
he wished "the old boy had gone away '
before the quarter began."

Discussion has arisen regarding the
technical name for the inhabitants of
Yap Island, which was the topic of a |
lecture the other night... Some are
inclined to acknowledge that they are
called Yaps, but others, since the Japs
want the Island, think they ought to be
called Yappanese.

We patiently await developments of!
the proposed ball fight between the |
"Daily" force and the Press gang. We
will make it a point to have a special
reporter cover the preliminary field.
We won't need one In the actual con
test. A typesetter hasn't anything on
the ball.
