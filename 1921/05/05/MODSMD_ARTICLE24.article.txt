# WIRELESS TEAM TO INVADE LOCAL FIELD SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Tlie Cardinal sticksters will meet the
nine of the Federal Telegraph Company
of Palo Alto on the local diamond Sat
urday afternoon in the third contest of
the spring series. Coach Seay has been
putting his men through heavy practice
in preparation for the trip to Japan. No
definite plans have been made with the
Japanese promoter who is handling the
negotiations for the series in the Orient,
but there is still a strong chance of the
Cards making the trip.
Nef will start the game against the
telegraphers with Gray and Knox in re
serve. Draper will probably stand by to
take the mound in case the Feds have a
rabbit-foot with them or start swatting
the apple. Bundy will do the receiving
at the start and Green may don the
armor later on i nthe game.
The Cardinal infield is developing
into one of the fastest machines that has
graced the home lot in many a day. Pat
terson at first, and his running mate,
Heckendorf, on the other corner, have
two of the best throwing arms in col
lege baseball today. They both handle
the stick with consistency and play heady
ball in both the offensive and defensive
formations. Kallam and Mitchell, at
short and the keystone, are botli vet
erans with the Card aggregation. They
have shaken the jinx which has been
spoiling thbir combination in the offen
sive play and in their old form
on the diamond.
Kline has surprised several runners of
the opposition this season when he
caught them off the sacks with his
trusty port heave. Carver and Crowe
have been pulling down the apple in reg
ular fashion and their offensive has been
good.
