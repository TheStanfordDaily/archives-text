# Professor Carruth Is Praised as Poet By San Jose Paper
## 
### 
"If William Herbert Carruth, head of
the English department at Stanford Uni
versity, had written only one poem and
that one poem were his 'Each in His
Own Tongue,' he would have been ac
claimed great." The above statement is
quoted from an article appearing in the
San Jose Evening News for April 29th.
The poem referred to is one of a col
lection written by Professor Carruth
while he was a member of the faculty
of the University of Kansas.
The article is an appreciation of his
work as a poet and a scholar, and the
News speaks very highly of Professor
Carruth as a leading figure in both of
these fields. To quote further: "This
poet has the ability to put himself into
close sympathy with the 'other side of
things.'
"It all depends on the point of view,
according to Professor Carruth's theory,
as to what subject master makes a good
poem. The best illustration of this
strikingly different point of view, a
visible and refreshing breaking away
from the conventional subject matter of
poetry, is found in Carruth's own very
original verses."
