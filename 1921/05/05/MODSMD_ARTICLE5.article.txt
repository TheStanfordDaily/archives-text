# CLASS OF 1922 SETS STAGE FOR FESTIVE EVENTS OF JUNIOR WEEK
## CELEBRATION TO BEGIN TONIGHT Fireworks and Music on Lake Will Open Program. Which Ends With Opera Saturday 
### 
Junior Week, joy of the roughs,
despair of him who buys two oj every
thing, full of events, long to be re
membered Junior Week is here!
Committees have been hard at work
for a month to make these few days
a success, and if past performances
are any guide, this Junior Week will
live up to, if not outshine, any previ
ous effort of Stanford in the way of
entertainment. Junior Week is a
distinctively Stanford institution,
originated in the early days of the
University, and every year becoming
more and more of a tradition.
Features Start Tonight
Fireworks on Lagunita this even
ing will start the merriment, which
will last until the last chorus lady
has appeared for the last time on Sat
urday evening. \The committee {in
charge, headed by Hudson Proctor,
-■'21, promises unique features in the
way of entertainment and 4th of July
fireworks. Some extremely original
and beautiful pieces >utve been secur
ed from San Francisco, and these will
be set off on tiie far side of the Lake.
Jack Heffernan, '22, who is in charge
of the entertainment will have two
stringed orchestras to furnish synco
pation. One will be on shore and the
other on a platform out on the lake.
The University Band will give a con
cert during the evening.
It is planned to have special light
ing effects and the pathways will be
decorated and artistically Illuminated.
Junior Prom Has Novel
Decorations
Perhaps th-e most beautiful and
novel scheme ever planned by a Prom
Committee has been worked out for
this year's dance. King Arthur and
Ibis court will be the patrons of the
affair, and could the •good old king
actually be bere in person, he would
enjoy every minute of the evening.
King Artlvur and the "Knights and the
Ladies of bis court will form a frieze
around the walls, mounted on beauti
ful posters, colored in dull bines and
greens. The committee requests that
the places -marked off by these names
be used as dance rendezvous. The
following names will be used: King
Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Galahad,
~Sir Launcelot, Elaine, Sir Gawain, Sir
Garet, Lynette, Sir Merlin, Vivien, Sir
Geraint, Enid, Lady of Shalott, and
Fool Dagonet.
The ceiling has been planned with an
eye both to effect and to ventilation.
In contrast to the somber colors of
the posters, It will be a riotous scheme,
blending in all the hues, tints and
shades from deep purple at the ends to
brilliant yellow at the middle. Ten
spotlights wil lilluminatc this rainbow
roof.
Still further in pursuance of the
rainbow idea, a double rainbow, lit
by 20 combination spotlights from the
floor, will shed its rosy glow upon the
lucky couples. In harmony with the
ceiling, bright yellow will form the
center of the rainbow, while dark blue
will be used at the ends. The lights
will be arranged in pairs, so that the
complimentary colors will be together
and they will be changed constantly
during the evening.
Orchestra of Music
Mere mention of the fact that Am
brose Whitmer, '21, Joe Nathanson,
'20, and eight other players will fur
nish the music, assures that Encina
gymnasium will resound with the
most delightful symphonies which it
has ever echoed.
A delectable collation consisting of
salad, chicken patties, ice cream and
coffee, will be served during the sup
per dance, at about 11:30, which will
be off the program. The dance will
start promptly at K:45, and will last
until 1:00 a.m. There will be 14
dances and no extras.
Lake Sport Prizes Offered
An additional incentive has been
offered to aquatic champions to ex
hibit their skill on Saturday morning.
Palo Alto merchants have contributed
substantial prizes which will be
awarded by Coach Ernst Brandsten
and Mrs. Bransten. Swimming, div
ing and canoe races will be partici
pated in by both men and women, who
may sign up on the entry lists posted
in their respective gymnasiums. Canoe
rescue work and canoe tilting will be
additional contests for men. -
Olympic Club Meet to Be Close
According to all the dope, the men
from San Francisco have a slight
edge on the Cardinal team, but Coach
Templeton is confident that his men
will come through when the moment
comes. The first Olympic Club meet
resulted in a victory for the visiting
team, by a very small margin, while
Stanford took the long end of the score
by one point in the next clash.
Junior Opera will Be Climax
Saturday evening, the most antici
pated event will come off, when the
curtain raises on the 1922 Junior Opera
cast and chorus. This year, there has
been plenty of time to train, so the
plot and songs have developed with
great rapidity. Last night the first
dress rehearsal was held, and went off
smoothly.
This year's production has a very
real and clever plot. Tlosemarie
Drachmand and Daniel Evans will be
largely responsible, as co-authors, for
the way the Opera gets over.
Donaldine Cameron, '23, and Philip
Richards, '17, in the leads have more
than justified their choice, judging by
their work in rehearsals. Miss Cameron,
who is the maid who is "Maid to
Order," makes a striking mctamorphus
from the ugly duckling to the much
sought after and beautiful swan, while
Phil Richards leaves nothing to be
desired in his presentation of the
"good fairy" bachelor role. After you
have seen the play you can decide for
yourself whether you, too, would not
take $50,000 from such a bewitching
heroine. Miss Cameron had the lead
in this year's Sophomore Play.
Bizarre lighting effects are secured
by a battery of spot lights placed
around the rim of the balcony, which
will illuminate the various scenes.
Taken all in all, this Junior Week
bids fair to provide enough pop and
jazz to last all the rest of the quar
ter, and lucky, indeed, are the far
sighted people who get Prom and
Opera tickets early in the rush.

Jack Heffernan, '22, who is in charge
of the entertainment will have two

The University Band will give a con

It is planned to have special light

Junior Prom Has Novel
Decorations
Perhaps th-e most beautiful and
novel scheme ever planned by a Prom
Committee has been worked out for
this year's dance. King Arthur and
Ibis court will be the patrons of the
affair, and could the •good old king
actually be bere in person, he would
enjoy every minute of the evening.
King Artlvur and the "Knights and the
Ladies of bis court will form a frieze
around the walls, mounted on beauti
ful posters, colored in dull bines and
greens. The committee requests that
the places -marked off by these names
be used as dance rendezvous. The
following names will be used: King
Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Galahad,
~Sir Launcelot, Elaine, Sir Gawain, Sir
Garet, Lynette, Sir Merlin, Vivien, Sir
Geraint, Enid, Lady of Shalott, and
Fool Dagonet.
The ceiling has been planned with an
eye both to effect and to ventilation.
In contrast to the somber colors of
the posters, It will be a riotous scheme,
blending in all the hues, tints and
shades from deep purple at the ends to
brilliant yellow at the middle. Ten
spotlights wil lilluminatc this rainbow
roof.
Still further in pursuance of the
rainbow idea, a double rainbow, lit
by 20 combination spotlights from the
floor, will shed its rosy glow upon the
lucky couples. In harmony with the
ceiling, bright yellow will form the
center of the rainbow, while dark blue
will be used at the ends. The lights
will be arranged in pairs, so that the
complimentary colors will be together
and they will be changed constantly
during the evening.
Orchestra of Music
Mere mention of the fact that Am
brose Whitmer, '21, Joe Nathanson,
'20, and eight other players will fur
nish the music, assures that Encina
gymnasium will resound with the
most delightful symphonies which it
has ever echoed.
A delectable collation consisting of
salad, chicken patties, ice cream and
coffee, will be served during the sup
per dance, at about 11:30, which will
be off the program. The dance will
start promptly at K:45, and will last
until 1:00 a.m. There will be 14
dances and no extras.
Lake Sport Prizes Offered
An additional incentive has been
offered to aquatic champions to ex
hibit their skill on Saturday morning.
Palo Alto merchants have contributed
substantial prizes which will be
awarded by Coach Ernst Brandsten
and Mrs. Bransten. Swimming, div
ing and canoe races will be partici
pated in by both men and women, who
may sign up on the entry lists posted
in their respective gymnasiums. Canoe
rescue work and canoe tilting will be
additional contests for men. -
Olympic Club Meet to Be Close
According to all the dope, the men
from San Francisco have a slight
edge on the Cardinal team, but Coach
Templeton is confident that his men
will come through when the moment
comes. The first Olympic Club meet
resulted in a victory for the visiting
team, by a very small margin, while
Stanford took the long end of the score
by one point in the next clash.
Junior Opera will Be Climax
Saturday evening, the most antici
pated event will come off, when the
curtain raises on the 1922 Junior Opera
cast and chorus. This year, there has
been plenty of time to train, so the
plot and songs have developed with
great rapidity. Last night the first
dress rehearsal was held, and went off
smoothly.
This year's production has a very
real and clever plot. Tlosemarie
Drachmand and Daniel Evans will be
largely responsible, as co-authors, for
the way the Opera gets over.
Donaldine Cameron, '23, and Philip
Richards, '17, in the leads have more
than justified their choice, judging by
their work in rehearsals. Miss Cameron,
who is the maid who is "Maid to
Order," makes a striking mctamorphus
from the ugly duckling to the much
sought after and beautiful swan, while
Phil Richards leaves nothing to be
desired in his presentation of the
"good fairy" bachelor role. After you
have seen the play you can decide for
yourself whether you, too, would not
take $50,000 from such a bewitching
heroine. Miss Cameron had the lead
in this year's Sophomore Play.
Bizarre lighting effects are secured
by a battery of spot lights placed
around the rim of the balcony, which
will illuminate the various scenes.
Taken all in all, this Junior Week
bids fair to provide enough pop and
jazz to last all the rest of the quar
ter, and lucky, indeed, are the far
sighted people who get Prom and
Opera tickets early in the rush.
Junior Week, joy of the roughs,
despair of him who buys two oj every
thing, full of events, long to be re
membered Junior Week is here!
Committees have been hard at work
for a month to make these few days
a success, and if past performances
are any guide, this Junior Week will
live up to, if not outshine, any previ
ous effort of Stanford in the way of
entertainment. Junior Week is a
distinctively Stanford institution,
originated in the early days of the
University, and every year becoming
more and more of a tradition.

greens. The committee requests that
the places -marked off by these names
be used as dance rendezvous. The
following names will be used: King
Arthur, Queen Guinevere, Sir Galahad,
~Sir Launcelot, Elaine, Sir Gawain, Sir
Garet, Lynette, Sir Merlin, Vivien, Sir
Geraint, Enid, Lady of Shalott, and
Fool Dagonet.
The ceiling has been planned with an
eye both to effect and to ventilation.
In contrast to the somber colors of
the posters, It will be a riotous scheme,
blending in all the hues, tints and
shades from deep purple at the ends to
brilliant yellow at the middle. Ten
spotlights wil lilluminatc this rainbow
roof.
Still further in pursuance of the
rainbow idea, a double rainbow, lit
by 20 combination spotlights from the
floor, will shed its rosy glow upon the
lucky couples. In harmony with the
ceiling, bright yellow will form the
center of the rainbow, while dark blue
will be used at the ends. The lights
will be arranged in pairs, so that the
complimentary colors will be together
and they will be changed constantly
during the evening.
Orchestra of Music
Mere mention of the fact that Am
brose Whitmer, '21, Joe Nathanson,
'20, and eight other players will fur
nish the music, assures that Encina
gymnasium will resound with the
most delightful symphonies which it
has ever echoed.
A delectable collation consisting of
salad, chicken patties, ice cream and
coffee, will be served during the sup
per dance, at about 11:30, which will
be off the program. The dance will
start promptly at K:45, and will last
until 1:00 a.m. There will be 14
dances and no extras.
Lake Sport Prizes Offered
An additional incentive has been
offered to aquatic champions to ex
hibit their skill on Saturday morning.
Palo Alto merchants have contributed
substantial prizes which will be
awarded by Coach Ernst Brandsten
and Mrs. Bransten. Swimming, div
ing and canoe races will be partici
pated in by both men and women, who
may sign up on the entry lists posted
in their respective gymnasiums. Canoe
rescue work and canoe tilting will be
additional contests for men. -
Olympic Club Meet to Be Close
According to all the dope, the men
from San Francisco have a slight
edge on the Cardinal team, but Coach
Templeton is confident that his men
will come through when the moment
comes. The first Olympic Club meet
resulted in a victory for the visiting
team, by a very small margin, while
Stanford took the long end of the score
by one point in the next clash.
Junior Opera will Be Climax
Saturday evening, the most antici
pated event will come off, when the
curtain raises on the 1922 Junior Opera
cast and chorus. This year, there has
been plenty of time to train, so the
plot and songs have developed with
great rapidity. Last night the first
dress rehearsal was held, and went off
smoothly.
This year's production has a very
real and clever plot. Tlosemarie
Drachmand and Daniel Evans will be
largely responsible, as co-authors, for
the way the Opera gets over.
Donaldine Cameron, '23, and Philip
Richards, '17, in the leads have more
than justified their choice, judging by
their work in rehearsals. Miss Cameron,
who is the maid who is "Maid to
Order," makes a striking mctamorphus
from the ugly duckling to the much
sought after and beautiful swan, while
Phil Richards leaves nothing to be
desired in his presentation of the
"good fairy" bachelor role. After you
have seen the play you can decide for
yourself whether you, too, would not
take $50,000 from such a bewitching
heroine. Miss Cameron had the lead
in this year's Sophomore Play.
Bizarre lighting effects are secured
by a battery of spot lights placed
around the rim of the balcony, which
will illuminate the various scenes.
Taken all in all, this Junior Week
bids fair to provide enough pop and
jazz to last all the rest of the quar
ter, and lucky, indeed, are the far
sighted people who get Prom and
Opera tickets early in the rush.
Junior Week, joy of the roughs,
despair of him who buys two oj every
thing, full of events, long to be re
membered Junior Week is here!
Committees have been hard at work
for a month to make these few days
a success, and if past performances
are any guide, this Junior Week will
live up to, if not outshine, any previ
ous effort of Stanford in the way of
entertainment. Junior Week is a
distinctively Stanford institution,
originated in the early days of the
University, and every year becoming
more and more of a tradition.
Features Start Tonight
Fireworks on Lagunita this even
ing will start the merriment, which

Junior Prom Has Novel
Decorations
Perhaps th-e most beautiful and
novel scheme ever planned by a Prom
Committee has been worked out for
this year's dance. King Arthur and
Ibis court will be the patrons of the
affair, and could the •good old king
actually be bere in person, he would
enjoy every minute of the evening.
King Artlvur and the "Knights and the
Ladies of bis court will form a frieze
around the walls, mounted on beauti
ful posters, colored in dull bines and
greens. The committee requests that
the places -marked off by these names
