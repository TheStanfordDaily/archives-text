# PUBLIC REHEARSAL OF OPERA WILL BE PRESENTED TONIGHT
## 
### 
Dress rehearsal will be held for the
public tonight at 7 o'clock in the Assem
bly Hall, for the Junior Opera. Proper
ties are dry enough now to present the
show en toto and the curtain will rise
promptly at the appointed time. The
doors to the auditorium will be opened
then. Admission will be 50 cents.
Last night the first complete rehearsal
of the play en-costume went off smooth
ly and brought to light the wonderful
costuming effects that have been se
cured for the play this year. The new
drapes at the back of the stage came in
for their share of comment on the beau
tiful coloring they took from the hidden
spot-lights on the stage- This constant
playing on the back will be one of the
most successful methods of keeping the
interest centered at the spot where it is
most desired.
With the opera together for the first
time last night, and the plot running
without interruption there was a chance
to see some of the real acting of the
oast members. Donaldine Cameron
seems to be cast perfectly in her role of
the little heiress with the timid ways.
Her sweet manner shows to particular
advantage "to her action with Phil Rich
ards as Ross Wayne. Their songs to
gether are real works of art, being both
finished in irtferpretatiofi and charmingly
given with tire easy grace of t*he two
performers.
Thea, Melby Berry, and Tubfcy, Haw
ley Mertz, have the Tight and airy part
of the acting. Thea is the maid in the
Modiste Shop of Simon. Her whirl
wind personification of the various types
that she affects is z. treat to'the eye and
soul, and she is ably backed up through
it all with the changeable Tubby.
The chief character part is held by
Arnold Bayley as Simon the modiste. He
has the hard part of the French importer
of creations from France, and his dia
logue is that perfect thai it is hard to
mark him from a native of the Seiine
