# GUSHING SPEAKS ON LEGAL ETHICS
## 
### 
The responsibility of the lawyer to the
state or community as distinguished
from 'his exclusive obligation to his
client, was the point stressed by o>. K.
Cushtng, member of the San Francisco
bar and prominent social worker, in his
talk on the ""Efhical Obligations of a
Lawyer," yesterday morning. Mr. Cmsh
ing's audience was composed largeJy of
advanced law students.
Thei<c is too much of a tendency
among 'lawyers to look upon their {pro
fession merely as a source of money
return, and to disregard the duty Which
lawyers, espacially coÃŸege-trained ones,
owe to ihe general pulflic, is the view of
Mr. Cuihing. The idea is too often held
that the sole function -of a lawyer is rto
provide an honest defense for his cliens.
Thc**second and last Mr. Cusliings
talks, held this morning at 10 o'clock in
the Law fcaiilding, was devoted to special
problems of professional ethics. Ques-f
tions and discussion occupied the latter
part of the hour. The talks this week
were in accordance with ihc policy of
thr Law School to keep in touch with
the progressive elements in law by hav
ing prominent lawyers speak on the
campus from time to time.
