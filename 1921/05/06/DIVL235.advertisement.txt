ABOUT THE CHOCOLATES
They are Wilson Quality, of course
This is a special assortment, nearly all from our $1.25 line, with
a few from our $1.00 line, packed in a beautiful fancy box... The
box alone cost us 25c, and we bought several thousand dollars
worth at one time.
ABOUT THE BPECIAL ASSORTMENT
The box contains 12 ounces of Rocky Roads —Snowballs —Mexi-
can Cream Loaf (with walnuts)—and Raspberry Roll. Rocky
Roads is probably the best liked candy that we make... The
other kinds are all new, and are as good as we know how to
make them. All sell at $1.00 a pound. $2.00 worth of candy
for $1.25.
Have you noticed the crowds of people taking home our Week-
End Specials? We started out to make this Week-End feature
a real event —and we have done it.
