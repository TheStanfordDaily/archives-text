HW I just can't tell you! Here it is, the middle of Junior H
HH Week (you knows what mobs of fun that is), and to M
M make excitement doubly exciting'—am to spend the

« And of course one couldn't think of going for such BROS. fe
gj a visit without many additions to one's wardrobe. 1
M did feel a bit anxious about writing home for rein
forcements, but the family were adorable about it. So g
rgj immediately I went down to ' IB
I ROOS BROS. I
rgj where I knew I'd find just what I wanted (although, of course, not having a fe
kg thought as to what I did want), and what do you s'pose I found? The darlingest rg|
153 blue serge dresses, springy looking, but simple enough for traveling, and one can H
ha always wear serge for all occasions. And then! their light summer dresses— H
rgi organdies in all the pastel shades, so individual looking, and with the most origi- fejj
rg nal trimmings. Wanted a whole flock of 'em, of Kf
rSi course. All this week, too, they are featuring the best H

gay and festive next week? Made quite a few discov- Gp
eries, too, at his place—all his things are from 20 per cent to 50 per cent less than K
in the city, and his wrist watches are especially attractive at prices about 20 per S
cent lower. It's really awfully nice to know about, and he carries the very latest EE
ideas as to jewelry of all kinds. \ , g
Did I tell you that the
MASON STUDIO I
finished the pictures that I was having made ? And MASON
m| dear,. I simple rave —know everyone else will—over £5
the workmanship; that is, they are, aside from subject STUDIO
matter, positively the most artistic things you ever saw. &
Mr. Mason has the art of shadowy, half-tone effects jft
down to a science, and the finish and general treatment $
are perfection. He knows just what effect he wants &

and how to get it, and the folders are the most attrac- ®
live looking. >

is another great help. They are always getting in new
dresses, and each time it seems they simply can't find p!
157] any more adorable models. And still they come—organdies and ginghams, always !^p
153 especially welcome. Quite fell for a fascinating shade of blue linen, made very sjjp
pgr plain—the new straight "coat-dress" lines, you know, and trimmed with a bit of E
pgi bright embrodiery. And organdies—do you like them bright and startling, or
kg do you like the more delicate, lighter shades? You can find the kind of dress 5
kg you've wanted for ages, fresh and new looking, and
kfl made perfectly. S
