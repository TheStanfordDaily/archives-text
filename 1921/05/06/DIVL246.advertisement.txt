"All is discovered—
leave at once!"
IN the shivery tones of melodrama false
prophets rise up to assure you that all the
wonders of electricity have been discovered,
that the industry has had its day, that you
should lose no time changing to some younger
and less developed profession.
There were folks giving this same advice
back in the eighteen seventies —but somehow
Edison and Hell seemed to think differently.
And now, depend upon it that in 1921 as at
any time during the last hundred years, the
world is on the eve of important inventions and
U discoveries and their commercialization in the
realm of electricity.
How momentous these developments shall
become in the next forty years is largely up to
you men now in college. It will fall upon you
to work out interconnection systems, to manage
water-power projects, to plan electrification ot
railroads, to extend the lines of communication
into new lands.
There are seventy million Americans who do
not use electricity in their homes. One of your
jobs will be to supply them.
So there is a long-time market for your ser
vices, a demand for your utmost energy and
enthusiasm and ability.
tYour cue is to start now thinking about your
work in a big way, building yourself to measure
up to the opportunities and the problems that
will be your share in developing this greater
industry of tomorrow.

The electrical industry needs men who can
