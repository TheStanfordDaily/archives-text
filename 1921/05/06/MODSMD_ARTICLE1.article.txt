# CARD TRACK MEN TO MEET WINGED 'O' THIRD TIME
## Varsity Nine Will Mix With Telegraphers on Local Lot In Spring Series Contest 
### 
Tbe athletic features of the Junior
Week program will be staged Satur
day afternoon, on the local fields, when
the Cardinal track artists meet the
Olympic Club squad and the Varsity
baseball nine crosses bats with the
invading team from the Federal Tele

and tomorrow will put it in first-class
condition and the races should be
fast.
Coach Seay's nine expects to add
another scalp to the spring series
when they meet the Wireless combi
nation in the third game since the
regular season closed. The Feds have
played six games this season with
