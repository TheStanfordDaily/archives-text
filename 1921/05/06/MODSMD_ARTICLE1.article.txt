# CARD TRACK MEN TO MEET WINGED 'O' THIRD TIME
## Varsity Nine Will Mix With Telegraphers on Local Lot In Spring Series Contest 
### 
Tbe athletic features of the Junior
Week program will be staged Satur
day afternoon, on the local fields, when
the Cardinal track artists meet the
Olympic Club squad and the Varsity
baseball nine crosses bats with the
invading team from the Federal Tele
graph Co. of Palo Alto. Both events
are scheduled to start promptly at 3
o'clock and the fans will have to take
their pick of the two sports.
The Cardinal trackmen have been
training steadily since the Big Meet
and this third clash with the Winged
O aggregation should furnish several
thrills for the fans. Captain Kirksey
may not enter the furlong event and
this would leave Wells and Carrey to
fight it out with Eddie Sudden and
Hayward of the Olympics. William
son will be unable to run in the half,
leaving Carlsmith and Murphy as the
Card entries in this event. Both of
theae men have been doing good time
find should make Farmer and Forward
earn their points if they get them.
The distance runs will probably go to
the Olympics with Eddelman standing
ia chance for second in the two-mile
run. To offset these points Temple
ton's weight men should take almost
every event with some seconds and
thirds. The relay will be a hard-fought
race from the gun to the tape and the
outcome Is in the air. Sudden will
considerably strengthen the Winged
O four and the Norton-Hayward-Farm
er combination will give him good run
ning mates.
The rains of the past two days have
slowed the track but sunshine today
and tomorrow will put it in first-class
condition and the races should be
fast.
Coach Seay's nine expects to add
another scalp to the spring series
when they meet the Wireless combi
nation in the third game since the
regular season closed. The Feds have
played six games this season with
San Francisco clubs and have a clean
record behind them. The Cards are
in the best shape of the season as
they have been practicing hard and
steadily improving. Nef will start at
the slab with Gray and Knox in re
serve. Bundy or Green will do the
receiving and between them take
care of the right area of the outer
gardens. Ringchop is to do the heav
ing for the Feds with O'Grady taking
his throws.

Tbe athletic features of the Junior
Week program will be staged Satur
day afternoon, on the local fields, when
the Cardinal track artists meet the
Olympic Club squad and the Varsity
baseball nine crosses bats with the
invading team from the Federal Tele
graph Co. of Palo Alto. Both events
are scheduled to start promptly at 3
o'clock and the fans will have to take
their pick of the two sports.
The Cardinal trackmen have been
training steadily since the Big Meet
and this third clash with the Winged
O aggregation should furnish several
thrills for the fans. Captain Kirksey
may not enter the furlong event and
this would leave Wells and Carrey to
fight it out with Eddie Sudden and
Hayward of the Olympics. William
son will be unable to run in the half,
leaving Carlsmith and Murphy as the
Card entries in this event. Both of
theae men have been doing good time
find should make Farmer and Forward
earn their points if they get them.
The distance runs will probably go to
the Olympics with Eddelman standing
ia chance for second in the two-mile
run. To offset these points Temple
ton's weight men should take almost
every event with some seconds and
thirds. The relay will be a hard-fought
race from the gun to the tape and the
outcome Is in the air. Sudden will
considerably strengthen the Winged
O four and the Norton-Hayward-Farm
er combination will give him good run
ning mates.
The rains of the past two days have
slowed the track but sunshine today
and tomorrow will put it in first-class
condition and the races should be
fast.
Coach Seay's nine expects to add
another scalp to the spring series
when they meet the Wireless combi
nation in the third game since the
regular season closed. The Feds have
played six games this season with
San Francisco clubs and have a clean
record behind them. The Cards are
in the best shape of the season as
they have been practicing hard and
steadily improving. Nef will start at
the slab with Gray and Knox in re
serve. Bundy or Green will do the
receiving and between them take
care of the right area of the outer
gardens. Ringchop is to do the heav
ing for the Feds with O'Grady taking
his throws.
