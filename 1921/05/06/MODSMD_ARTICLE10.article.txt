# ATTITUDE OF WOMEN DISCUSSED BY DEAN IN NEXT CARDINAL
## 
### 
What is the attitude of the Stan
ford woman toward her studies? Dean
Harriet Bradford answers thiß ques
tion in the May Cardinal in an article
entitled "All Cash or Some Credit."
Dean Bradford is cryptic in her ana
lysis of the "500," pointing out that
a large percentage solely interest
ed in studies from a cultural view
point. The adoption of a professional
•standard by the women is urged by
MU'-h Bradford.
Contributions to the May issue are
made by several of the faculty. A.
Donald Douglas is the author of a
story, "Those on the Outside." The
latest poem of Dr. Carruth is included
in the number, as well as a poem by
Raymond Alden.
"In Bangkok," written by Faye Kil
patrick, is a short description of the
Siamese capital, an Oriental city little
known to American travelers. The
article in the April Cardinal on bluff
ing professors is answered by Robert
Binkley in an analysis of the relation
between student and professor.
