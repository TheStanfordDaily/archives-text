# Fireworks and Concert Open Week's Activities
## 
### 
Music furnished by the University
band was the opening feature of
Junior Week festivities which were
inaugurated at Lagunita last night.
Beginning at 8 o'clock, a concert was
given from the balcony of the boat
house. Following the band program,
a stringed orchestra contributed to
the evening's entertainment, playing
first among the audience assembled
on the lake banks, and later giving
a number of songs from a boat on the
lake.
A new feature of the firework√ü,
which were the closing event of the
evening, was the use of a barge from
which the fireworks were set off on the
far Bide of the lake, instead of start
ing them from the lake banks. Sky
rockets and colored fire formed the
chief displays, and the illuminated
numerals "22" marked the close of
the evening's program.
