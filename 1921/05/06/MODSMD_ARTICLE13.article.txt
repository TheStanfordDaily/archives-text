# DECORATIONS ARE FEATURE OF DANCE; CHANGES EFFECTED
## 
### W. C. Evans, '22 
Decorated in large posters of King
Arthur and the Knights and Ladies of
his court to form a freize, the Junior
Prom promises to be one of the most
unique and novel schemes ever planned
by a Prom committee. The posters are
colored in dull blues and greens, while
in direct contrast, the ceiling has been
planned in a riotous color scheme, blend
ing in all hues, tints, and shades from
deep purple at the ends to brilliant yel
low at the middle.
As an added feature, 20 combination
spotlights have been secured and will
aid in the double rainbow cffect. The
lights will be arranged in pairs and will
be focused to blend together so that the
gowns of the dancers will catch the
hues of both at the same time. Through
the arrangement, the complimentary
colors will be kept together and
changed constantly during the evening.
Ambrose Whitmer, '21, and Joe Na
thanson, '20, together with eight other
players, will furnish the music for the
dance, assuring the couples of the best
obtainable, while a delectable collation
consisting of salad, chicken patties, ice
cream, and coffec will be served during
the supper dance.
Admission to the prom will be gained
only on the presentation of tickets. No
one will be allowed to enter upon the
program alone. The dance will start
promptly at 8:45 and will last until 1
a. m. ( there being 14 dances on the pro
gram- The Prom committee warns all
queeners against wearing flowers as no
one will be admitted with them.

Tomorrow night, the Junior Opera
will hold sway with an offering of the
most complete musical review that
has been seen here this season. Minor
changes have been made in the east
ing of the show and all is now in
readiness for the curtain raising. Tho
opera will commence at 8:15. Coach
Lester Seib with the assistance of the
expert advice of Gordon Davis is satis
fied that the play will make the same
"hit that it registered in tho rehearsal
last night.
The prologue which introduces that
action of the opera is a short little
piece of straight playing. The princi
pal. characters are shown in ttbeir
parts, and an outline-of the play given
and then the setting is complete for
the opening of the opera, proper.
"Simon," the curtain chorus, starta
the play off with a bang. The compo
teition is a breezy number introducing
the modiste Simon, the first character
to play upon the stage. The scene is
the interior of a French modiste's
where the manufacture of priceless
gowns for milady is in practice. Tho
first part of the act is taken up chief
ly by Tubby and Thea in their dia
logue in the shop, with an entrance
and "My Made to Order Maid," by
Phil Richards. Then comes "Our
Little Bungalow," by Tubby and Thea
and the men's chorus. "Say That
You Love Me," is by Fred Hughes, as
Tipu and is sung by Mary Lee. It is
the sentimental number of the opera
and goes over in fine form with the
interpretation of Hughes.
Tableau Orientate Features'
The second act opens with an ori
ental specialty dance by Beatrice
Broughton. The setting is in a Persian
court looking out onto a garden, and
the entire cast en-costume is upon the
stage, forming a colorful background
for the dance scene. The dancer
comes on from curtains parted by
oriental slave maidens, and does her
oriental toe dance to the composition
of C. W. Midgley.
Melba Berry as Thea has a feature
solo song. It is "Bad, Bad Men," by
Milton Roberts, and is a bear of a
character song. Mies Berry puts the
number over well. "Silhouette Girl/'
is a number sung by Warren Lewis
as Riggs Smythe. The beauties get a
fine effect in silhouette in a shadow
scene during the song. Augusta
Corey's song, "Cellars in the Pyra
mids," a comedy piece on the heritage
of Cleopatra in her will to the Egyp
tians, brings on the ponies in one of
their cutest numbers. They have a
little stagger dance that will surely
be a winner.
j The culmination of the action comes
when Mary Lee finds that she cannot
get Ross Wayne to fall for the fact
that she loves him in any other way
than by telling him. The Maid to
j Order chorus closes the act.

will hold sway with an offering of the
most complete musical review that
has been seen here this season. Minor
changes have been made in the east
ing of the show and all is now in
readiness for the curtain raising. Tho
opera will commence at 8:15. Coach
Lester Seib with the assistance of the
expert advice of Gordon Davis is satis
fied that the play will make the same
"hit that it registered in tho rehearsal
last night.
The prologue which introduces that
action of the opera is a short little
piece of straight playing. The princi
pal. characters are shown in ttbeir
parts, and an outline-of the play given
and then the setting is complete for
the opening of the opera, proper.
"Simon," the curtain chorus, starta
the play off with a bang. The compo
teition is a breezy number introducing
the modiste Simon, the first character
to play upon the stage. The scene is
the interior of a French modiste's
where the manufacture of priceless
gowns for milady is in practice. Tho
first part of the act is taken up chief
ly by Tubby and Thea in their dia
logue in the shop, with an entrance
and "My Made to Order Maid," by
Phil Richards. Then comes "Our
Little Bungalow," by Tubby and Thea
and the men's chorus. "Say That
You Love Me," is by Fred Hughes, as
Tipu and is sung by Mary Lee. It is
the sentimental number of the opera
and goes over in fine form with the
interpretation of Hughes.

The second act opens with an ori
ental specialty dance by Beatrice
Broughton. The setting is in a Persian
court looking out onto a garden, and
the entire cast en-costume is upon the
stage, forming a colorful background
for the dance scene. The dancer
comes on from curtains parted by
oriental slave maidens, and does her
oriental toe dance to the composition
of C. W. Midgley.
Melba Berry as Thea has a feature
solo song. It is "Bad, Bad Men," by
Milton Roberts, and is a bear of a
character song. Mies Berry puts the
number over well. "Silhouette Girl/'
is a number sung by Warren Lewis
as Riggs Smythe. The beauties get a
fine effect in silhouette in a shadow
scene during the song. Augusta
Corey's song, "Cellars in the Pyra
mids," a comedy piece on the heritage
of Cleopatra in her will to the Egyp
tians, brings on the ponies in one of
their cutest numbers. They have a
little stagger dance that will surely
be a winner.
j The culmination of the action comes
when Mary Lee finds that she cannot
get Ross Wayne to fall for the fact
that she loves him in any other way
than by telling him. The Maid to
