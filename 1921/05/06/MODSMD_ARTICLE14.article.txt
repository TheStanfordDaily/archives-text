# Fancy Dancing in Junior Opera Says Loquacious Lady
## 
### 
Come in, Anita, and learn to dance.
We guarantee to teach you everything
from the toddle to the Salute to
Spring. If you want some samples of
our ability, look around you.
The lady in white who twirls so
Bwiftly and balances so gracefully is
Miss Beatrice Broughton. Her dance
will be one of the main attractions of
this year's Junior Opera. She dances
with the grace of a prima ballerina
and her twinkling toes have a move
ment all their own.
On your left another young lady
is showing you that three-in-one is
not confined to oil. Miss Dorothy
Woodhead is demonstrating her abili
to to dance, sing a song, and play a
violin all at once, At times the lashes
a dazzling smile and with such talent
as that in action, another song of the
opera is sure to be a hit.
Oh no, we don't neglect the ball
room. The good-looking couple over
there doing the toddle, with variations,
are Miss Donaldine Cameron and Mr.
Phil Richards. They are working out
the Bteps for one of the ensemble
numbers which they lead and the
Castles in their palmy days had no
thing on these two.
Sorry you have to go. Wanted to
show you some novel ideas the chor
uses are putting into their steps. They
have a new way of turning that is a
whiz â€”but say, drop in to the Opera
tomorrow night and learn what real
dancing is like.
