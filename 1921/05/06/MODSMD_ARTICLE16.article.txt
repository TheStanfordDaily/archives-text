## 
### 
"Mrs. Beelzebub Chooses" was the
title of the clever skit put on by the
new members of the English Club at the
annual initiation held Tuesday evening
in the Women's Clubhouse. An allegory
written by Carl Wilhelmson, one of the
initiates, formed the basis of the skit,
which was arranged by Frances Cooper,
Charles McNichols, and the author.
The theme of the play was a satire on
the social life of the campus, and the
idea was cleverly carried out by the
characters, which included such well
known personages as "Stickey* the
candy man, the campus scandal monger,
the college professor, and the actor in
college dramatics. Those who took part
in the skit were Dorothy Pierce, Thomas
Kleckner, Prances Cooper, (Charles Mc-
Nichols, Matthew Tcbriner, Marian
Petray, Raymond Moore, Carl Wilhelm
son, and Ivan Deach.
