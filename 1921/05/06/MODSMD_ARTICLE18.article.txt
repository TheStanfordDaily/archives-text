						TWO WEEKS' WEEK-END
## 
### 
This week-end, Junior Week, the greatest of the social college year,
should find every campus man or woman, who is harboring any thoughts
of "queening" or parties for the next two weeks, active, and working
(hem off his mind. Let every one make the activities of this week satisfy
rhc demand for at least seven days to corm\ for next Saturday every loyal
student will have an important part of a different nature to play on the
campus. h W
The most prominent and active Stanford alumni of the Bay region,
together with a great many from more distant points, have accepted the
invitation of the University to see the Farm in actual operation and will
he hefe next Saturday, Alumni Day. The day can be a success only if
the students remain in a body on the campus and give their time to the
graduates, explaining the Stanford of today and showing them the
present plant.
Junior Week should find every one not active in the farm festivities
partaking of their regular parties in San Francisco or San Jose. Next
Saturday should see every one at home to welcome the men of the older
days.
