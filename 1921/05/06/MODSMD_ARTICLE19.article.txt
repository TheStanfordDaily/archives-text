It might be well to follow the suggestion of the announcement that
has been circulated oti the campus about Mother's Day. The card reads :
"There are none of us but have stood in reverence before the love
and sacrifice of our best friends, our mothers. Next to their joy in what
we are and in what we achieve, nothing warms their hearts like <»ur
messages of appreciation when we are absent from them."
With the announcement was thoughtfully enclosed an envelope and
sheet of paper for writing home. Lt is almost too little a sacrifice, with
so much done for us, to express what mothers really deserve. 1 lowever.
this seems the very least that can be done, next Sunday, to please them,
our best friends.
