# TICKETS FOR FRENCH PLAYS NOW ON SALE
## 
### 
Tickets for the performances of
"L'Aslle de Nuit," and "Le Pharma
eien," to bo staged by the Cercle
Francais next Wednesday night, for
the benefit of their French orphans,
hare been placed on sale. They may
be obtained on the Quad, at Crandall's
in Palo Alto, and from members of
the Cercle Francais, for 75 cents
apiece.
The plays will be presented in the
Little Theater and as a consequence
only a limited number of seats are
available, as the Little Theater has
accommodations for some 300 persons
only. The facilities of the small Btage
will be put to the best possible use,
and, on account of the size of the the
ater, the words of the actors will be
able to bo heard distinctly.
Both of the plays are printed in
French that can be easily understood,
#nd this, combined with movements
and expressions of the players, ought
to enable the person with a small
knowledge of the language to enjoy
the plays in English, which will be
distributed to the audience.
The rehearsals, which have been in
progress for some time, show that the
casts possess, not only a clarity of
diction in French, but also marked
ability as actorß. Paul Herkman, as
Haps, the tramp, to whom there be
falls queer experiences in a municipal
lodging house, in "L'Asile do Nuit,"
and Raoul May, in the title role of
"Le Pharmacien," are particularly
good.
The remainder of the program is
rapidly taking shape. A number of the
"500" who are interested in French
music will sing several popular French
numbers. The musical numbers also
are in simple French, being for the
most part, folk and "homo" songs.
They will bo presented between the
two playß under the direction of Miss
Jessie Smith of the Romanic Language
department.
