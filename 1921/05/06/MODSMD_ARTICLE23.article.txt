# CABBAGES AND THINGS

An epidemic of some contagious dis
ease that affects so-called humorists
has stricken the Cabbage family. Talk
about saving the starving, why not;
come to the assistance of the brain
children of Mr. Cabbage. They're dy
ing off like flies.

l)o you know that one joke will j
keep one of these ehildreu alive for j
yi day? Do you know that ten jokes
, will keep one going until the next I
A
harvest? We appeal to the generous j
Stanford fathers who have had brain
children of their own.

He —Did you hear the Boy Wonder?
Haw—Wonder? Are they doing it

Reports from the training quarters \
of the University ball team, :
have it that ouce in a while in prac-{
tice they hurl the horse-hide sphere;
as far as fifty feet. The fence that i
surrounds the lot is used as a back-j
stop. It hasn't been missed yet.

The only thing a professor can do j
that's worse than ditching his eight j
o'clock, when his class has assembled.'
is to come.

We wish Jiggs had a chance at this j
columns. All he'd need would be a
little corned beef to go with it. No
wonder Maggie goes wild.

Why it is that straw hats get the
razz on the campus? Every time one
appears, whether it's shielding the i
marcel waves of a snake or an off-1
campus Joe, an awful howl goes up.
They look far more civilized than the
pld red bonnet that used to set the
Quad on fire. Some of the boys must
not like to be reminded of the old 1
homestead.

Crippled, mutilated, murdered beyond i
recognition by the loss of S. CI. Trimble, i
the "Dip" makeup man, through machin
ations of the rival team too horrible to
print, the Stanford Press force is still
willing to tackle the Daily staff at base
ball. The Lina Pi frat has a battery
composed of real ball players. Mayer
hofer and Hoerbclt.
As for the rest, they're SOME
Etaoin Shrdlus. Put the Press gang
insists that even if the Sanctum Satics '
can touch one of "Lenny's" pitches,
they'll never reach first. "Noisy"
Giffin, on bngo pritnero, is a mountain
of strength, so big he will shut off the
light of the sun from the would-be run
ner, who'll have to grope in the dark to
find the sack.
And the traveler will find it even
darker on second, where dusky Frank
presides. Yep, it looks dark for the pen
pushers' chances. Little "Barney" will
scoop 'em up at short and he's a jack
rabbit full of jack. "Clean-up" Shef
field at third may clean tip something
besides the hell-box.
Outfielder!, look at them! "Dreamy
Dan" Ostrom, de Bonnet, Whitter,
Schmidt, Muriel, and Palmer- what a
superficiality of talent when you look at
the battery! Why, even Harry Borba,
who always scores for the varsity, won't
tally.

Now, maybe you don't think that's
funny, but S. G. Trimble wrote it

MANY ARE CALLED BUT FEW
GET UP.
