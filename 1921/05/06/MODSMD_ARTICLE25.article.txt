Seventeen Grows Up
We rather liked "Nineteen audi
Phyllis." This picture down at the
Stanford is a peculiar sort of thing
and its worth or lack of worth depends
entirely upon how it strikes you per
sonally. The plot is hopeless, even
absurd at times, but Charles flay gives
a really fine presentation of the joys
and tribulations of nineteen-year-old
youth.
We got a big kicK out of fondly
imagining that we were mature enough
and er —broad-minded enouph to laugh
at the things which happened to us
when we were nineteen. However,
we are only a year or so beyond that
memorable milestone and we couldn't
help thinking that the portrayal of
some of its vagaries was a little vivid.
Wherein We Do a Chas. Ray
As we were getting up to leave the
theater we developed a sudden fond
ness for the chair in which we were
sitting. In fact we had difficulty in
parting and found, on investigation,
that we had been sitting all evening
on a wad of chewing gum.
We turned for sympathy to the Lady
Who Sat Beside Us and s?ie promised
not to laugh at us. All of which was
comforting but as we walked down
University Avenue with that gob of
goo on our newly-pressed trousers we
felt fully as foolish as Charlie Ray
discovered in a dress suit and tennis
shoes.
Now For the Novelties
The Opera this year has enough out
of the ordinary stunts connected with
it to make it worth-while as a curi
osity, even beyond its entertainment
value. fashion show staged in a
modiste's shop, a toe dance, and a
saxophone sextette, are some of the
features 011 the artistic side.
On the mechanical side, there are
four big spotlights and three baby
spotlights, all used together and mak
ing all kinds of color effects. Con
necting the operators and the electrici
an at the main switchboard are five
telephones and when it comes to work
ing together, ham and eggs have noth
ing on the lighting force.
A Peep Behind the Scenes
Speaking of the mechanical side,
give a thought to the stage crew. They
build the background against which
the beauty and talent of the cast are
seen to best advantage and their
work takes skill. The sets for this
year's opera have been built under
the able direction of C. E. Stewart,
'20, the stage manager.
The settings were designed by Ed
ward M. Farmer, '23, and painted by
Clyde Coakloy. '22. Farmer made
miniatures in full color and Coakley
used these as his patterns.
Such are the craftsmen of the stage.
You Know Me, Al!
The main attraction up in the city
just now is Al Jolßon In the Winter
Garden show "Slnbad." Despite the
encroachments of Frank Tinney (who
is 110 slouch, by any means) Jolson
still retains his title as king of black
face comedians, and his Impromptu
chatter Is a joy forever.
"Sinbad" has been going since 4019
tand hasn't stopped yet. As a produc
tion it never was tnucli but it furnishes
! a convenient vehicle for Al Jolson,
and what more could anyone want?
