# TATLOCK GIVES TALK ON MEDIAEVAL LATIN
## 
### 
The importance of medieval Latin was
outlined by Professor J. S. P. Tatlock
of the English department in his talk
before the Classical Club 011 "Some
Aspects of* Medieval Latin Literature."
Latin was the language of the intellec
tual life of the period, and became the
medium of a vast and varied literature.
Professor Tatlock pointed out the dif
ferences between medieval and classical
Latin. Latin, he said, along with Italian
and German, is the great language for
singing, being especially adapted for
sacred music. He illustrated his re
marks with readings from some of the
famous Latin hvmns.
