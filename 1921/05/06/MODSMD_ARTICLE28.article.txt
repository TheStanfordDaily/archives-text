# PROTECTION OF WILD LIFE RESOURCES IS URGED BY SPEAKER
## 
### 
"We have been wasteful of our wild
life resources and it is high time that
we protect them and see that a breeding
type is maintained," was the substance
of w illustrated lecture by Mr. H. C.
Bryant, for some years economic orni
thologist at the University of California,
given at the Little Theater under the
auspices of the Zoology Club.
Two valuable birds and two mammals
have been entirely blotted out of Cali
fornia because our legislators have been
negligent in the matter of animal con
servation, Mr. Bryant said. The grizzly
bear has been entirely exterminated, and
antelope meat, which once sold in San
Francisco for less than beef, is now very
scarce, as there are only 200 antelope
left in the state. Only 500 Roosevelt elk
arc left, and the number of geese and
other game is growing less yearly. How
ever, although nearly 12,000 deer are
shot in California every year, the deer
supply 6eems to be holding out fairly
well.
The reason for the decrease in our

game supply is the "game hog" who
takes more than he can use, Mr. Bryant
explained. He cited the instance of a
champion "game hog" in Colusa county
who shot 218 geese in a little over
two hours, using a 4-gauge shotgun.
Much lias been done in the way of
legislation and propaganda to preserve
our game resources. By limiting the
season and providing a maximum bag,
and by the provision of twenty game
refuges in California where birds can
breed unmolested, a start has been
made. However, a program of educa
tion must be undertaken to overcome the
apathy of the public in game conserva
tion, said Mr. Bryant. He warmly
praised Stanford, which he said, "has
turned out the best nature study teachers
under Professor Jenkins that California
has ever had."
