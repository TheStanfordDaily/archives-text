# SCHUBERT CLUB WILL MEET TUESDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Members of Schubert Club will meet
Tuesday evening at 7:30 in the Women's
Clubhouse to rehearse for the concert to
be given in the Community House in
Palo Alto on May 22. This rehearsal
will include only Schubert Club mem
bers, and not those who are only to be
in the Faust performance.
