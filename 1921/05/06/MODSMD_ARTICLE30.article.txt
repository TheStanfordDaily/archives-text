# Palo Alto High and San Jose Will Meet in Track
## 
### 
Palo Alto High School's track team
goes into one of its most important
meets of the year tomorrow afternoon
when the annual dual meet with San
Jose comes off.
Chances for a victory look good, but
the result is bound to be close. San Jose
has not made as good a showing in the
meets heretofore, but in this one they
will be able to use her postgraduates,
which will strengthen them greatly.
Leistner of Palo Alto looks good for
three first places, in the hfgh and low
hurdles and the broad jump. Captain
Charles will annex the mile and prob
ably also the half. The quarter and hun
dred will probably go to San Jose, and
may also win the discus, shot and
high jump. Scofield of Palo Alto is due
to make a good showing in the pole
vault.
