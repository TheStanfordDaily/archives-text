# NESTORIA SOCIETY DEFEATS COLLEGE OF PACIFIC IN DEBATE
## 
### 
Nestoria Debating Society was the vic
tor by a unanimous decision in a debate
with the College of the Pacific on the
question, "Resolved, that strikes in es
sential industries should be prohibited by
federal legislation," in the Little Theater
last night. Nestoria supported the neg
ative. The judges on this occasion were
Reverend Irvin Pollard of the Baptist
Church, Frank G. Hoge of Palo Alto,
and Professor O. M. Johnston of the
Romanic Languages department.
In opening the debate for the affirma
tive, Lawton Harris of the College of the
Pacific, made the point that the need of
the American people was for unity, and
that such a strike would serve to bring
distress upon the public. J. T. Mc-
Menamin, '21, making the first speech
for the negative, asserted that in taking
away the laborer's right to strike the
government was depriving him of his
only means of obtaining justice.
The successful operation of the plan
in Kansas and Australia formed the
basis of the argument advanced by
Luther Meyer, the affirmative's second
speaker. B. E McGiffery, '24, for Nes
toria, declared the impractibility of the
plan as tried out in different parts of
the United States and Canada.
This debate was the concluding con
test of a dual argument, the first of
which was won by the College of the
Pacific at San Jose, Wednesday evening.
J. V. Gomes, '22, and Martin DeVries.
'21, represented Nestoria on the affirma
tive side of the same question at that
time.
Nestoria is planning to stage an ora
torical contest at its meeting on May 19.
