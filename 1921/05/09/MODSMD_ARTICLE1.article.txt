# BRILLIANT OPERA ENDS SUCCESSFUL EVENTS OF ANNUAL JUNIOR WEEK
## Saturday Morning Sports at Lake Prove Great Attraction 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
From the opening ensemble of "Simon
the Modiste" to the final curtain on the
last act, the Junior Opera of the present
year was the most extensive and success
ful of the operas that have been staged
so far. The comment of critics is prac
tically unanimous in giving it that place.
The excellent completeness of the plot
coupled with the superb staging and per
fect action resulted i'n this achievement.

Characterizations could not have been
more admirably made from the point of
fitting them to the persons. Donaldine
Cameron showed her versatility to good
advantage when she made successfully
the change from the character of the
"ugly duckling" in her first appearance
to the finished, beautiful, and charming
young lady at the end of the plot. Her
dainty personality made her presence on
the stage particularly pleasing to the
audience all of the time.

Phil Richards in the part of Ross
Wayne, wealthy bachelor, made his hit in
his song, "Mary Lee." The lyric beauty
of his voice had an excellent chance for
showing in the song and he made good
use of it. This season is Richards' first
on the legitimate stage, although he has
been with glee clubs and professional
singing organizations for a number of
years. His work at times showed a
slight lack of stage presence but the rare
quality of his voice more than covered
this.
" Arnold Bayley, as Simon the Mo
diste carried the chief character part
of the show and carried his difficult
French role with all the assurance
of a professional. It was his finished
work in handling the French diglect
that helped greatly to enliven cer
tain parts of the plot where the ac
tion might otherwise have seemed
slow. He combined the rapid fire
Frenchman with enough of the sta
bility of adopted Americanism to make
the character part come across just
right.

Comedy was well put over by Hawley
Mertz as Tubby and Melba Berry as
Thea. Miss Berry is an old hand in the
comedy game, having successfully
handled parts of the same kind -in plays
on the local stage for the last two years.
Her part was not hard to take, but was
that of the fun-makilTg little girl in the
shop of the Parisiene modiste. She and
Mertz, as her enamored swain, put over
their dialogue and their song, "Our
Little Bungalow," in a way that left
nothing to be desired for finesse.

Fred Hughes and Bess Mac Arthur,
taking the parts of the Persian diplomat
and his wife, carried off the Oriental
manner to perfection. Hughes did the
hard character part of the Indian minis
ter in perfect style, and his singing of the
difficult number, "Bengal Maid," was
masterful. Mr. and Mrs. Riggs-Smythe,
the wealthy middle-aged couple, were
well taken off by Warren Lewis and
Mildred Walter. Lewis' rich baritone
was particularly good in his song, "Sil
houette Girl."
The choruses showed the effect of
the extensive training they had received.
Their dances were all new and original
steps, and were put across perfectly.
The ponies in their dance in the "Pyra
mids" showed up extremely well, their
individuality being evident in the encore
where they pulled their little stagger
step.
The two novelty numbers, that of
Beatrice Broughton in the oriental
dance and the Baxaphone sextet were
received by the audience with the
heartiest of applause. It Is popularly
claimed that the spectacle and dance
