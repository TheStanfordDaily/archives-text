# BACK IN STRIDE
## 
### 
Junior week is said to mark the end of the active phase of the year's
activity. The principle major and minor athletic events already have
been concluded. The senior farce alone of the dramatic productions is
yet to be staged.,
A general relaxation would then seem to be in order, for not many
care to return to work after a strenuous period in any activity. The
abandon of a .warm day free from responsibility, the luxury of a pleasant
afternoon 'putpO'sely wasted in the hills, hold attractions beside which
studies are' 'an" irksome nuisance and any kind of serious thought is
bothersome.
Vet in many respects the remaining few weeks are the most impor
tant of the' year.' Tn one event at least, the student alumni day next Sat
urday, the students have yet to put over successfully something which
lias this far in the history of the University never been accomplished —
that of welcohiing the graduates in such a way as to promote an interest
in the presentfartn that will make of them active supporters of Stanford.
The general appearance of the registrar's card to be sent out at the end
of the quarter is to be determined largely by the few weeks to come, and
the cards have considerable significance in relation to student activity of
next fall. Practically all student organizations have yet to complete their
work successfully.
In any kind of activity true strength is measured by the finish.
Every measure that is carried out successfully now means a better start
in the autumn, and the aim of the present student body should be to make
that start as favorable as possible, for the students in October will be
met with toilgh problems enough, regardless of all that may be accom
plished now.,
