# AN UNREASONABLE FEW, AGAIN

Some,people,must be reminded occasionally that they are gentlemen.
Others wou!4 not tgJce a hint were it presented with diagrams by the
most forceful blackboard speaker in the world. In the crowd of sight
seers who lounge arpund the Engineers' corner and bench and rail of
the curbing, adjacent there are a few of both types. Women are required
to pass the cprner several times a day on their way to and from classes.
It is the wQnt. o£ some pleasant youths to sit on the advantageous side
of the strqet converse about the passing show in no uncertain or
subdued terms. , \
The action is in itself an affront to Stanford women—or would be
to any women, ft is not the outcome of tradition, for there never was
an attempt to make sport of women in other than a playful manner. No
doubt the congregated roughs think they are only having a
little sport, at, the expense of the "co-ed." But more than this, some are
making a. spectacle of themselves that is not pleasing to the casual
observer.
The .sober-minded rough knows this. He ought to be able to stop
the unreasonable few in their overstepping of his traditional privileges
and require that the men who seek the station of his favorite corner keep
within the boundaries of courtesy and common sense.
Now, someone is going to remark that the Daily wants the Engi
neering corner abolished. Not at all. Hut in any activity there are
always a few who go to unreasonable lengths. They have been responsi
ble, for the abolition' of more than one custom. In the present case they
would do w'e,|) to apply the principles taught by experience.
