# PROFESSOR PROCTOR AIDS FEDERAL BOARD STUDENTS

### 
After receiving his master's degree at
Stanford in 1916, Professor William
t Martin Proctor was appointed instruc
• tor in the Education department, in
' which he is now associate professor.
Ever since his student days of *15 he
has been connected with the University,
except for war service, when he was
; principal and educational director of the
English School at Camp Fremont.
This school was supposed to teach
illiterates to speak and read English in
three months in order that the men
could join their units and get into action.
There were 800 men in attendance, 45
per cent of whom were Italians, and the
rest were distributed in birth among 33
other nationalities. '
Upon the disbanding of the school,
Professor Proctor spent some time at
the Presidio in vocational guidance of
discharged men, and at the same time
was engaged in teaching at Stanford as
an instructor and writing his thesis for a
Ph.D. After receiving his degree in
June, 1919, he was promoted to assistant
professor. Since October 1, 1919, he has
been co-educator for the Federal Board
for Vocational Education.
Starting with 20 Federal Board men,
the department has grown to 124. Any
ex-service man who has received injury
in the service, making it impossible for
him to continue working at his occupa
tion prior to army service, is entitled to
education which will fit him for another
occupation. The men receive their
tuition, books and $100 per month duripg
the period of their schooling. All kinds
of disabilities are suffered by the men
receiving this education, from gunshot
wounds to disease, but no man is per
mitted to attend the University, Profes
sor Proctor says, who has not passed a
very rigid physical examination, insur
ing his freedom from contagious disease.
The students attend under a special
ruling of the Board of Trustees which
disregards them as pertaining to the en
trance limitation. Federal Board men
are not considered as part of the 650 new
men admitted each year. The group has
maintained scholarship equal to or over
A

the men's average ever since its en
i trance, with the exception of one quar
ter. This is directly attributable to the
! careful supervision given to the men's
work.
All eligibility is decided by the Federal
Board. Some men are admitted on evi
dence discovered in psychology tests of
their ability, who have but two years of
high school training. Any man getting
a mark better than a "B" on Alpha
Army Test is admitted, and elimination
by the flunk-out route of this group is
smaller than of those having full high
school preparation. No man who passed
with an "A" grade has failed to make
good in scholarship.
One of the members of this year's
varsity baseball squad is a Federal Board
man, Professor Proctor said, and has#
played a good game all season. It was in
action in the Argonne that he received
his wound, and while lying among the
other wounded waiting for attention he
happened to smile at the stretcher
bearer who was taking men in to the
doctor, and so impressed the man, that
he was taken in and saved. The Ger
mans got everything but the nerve ''of
some of the students, the professor said;
and one of these who is working with
the Palo Alto American Legion, was re
cently conspicuous in cleaning up the
bootleggers and gold-brickers who were
operating there.
After obtaining his A.B. from Whit
man in '01, with Phi Beta Kappa honors,
Professor Proctor taught history and
civics in the Washington State Normal
School" at Cheney. In 1911 he accepted
the post as the professor of education at
Pacific University, of Oregon. In 1914—
15 Professor Proctor served in the ca
pacity of dean of the faculty at Pacific
University. Besides his classes and his
visitation work among the high schools
of Oregon and southern Washington, it
became his duty to hustle students and
address commencements and conduct all
the other activities incumbent upon deans
instead of giving up his nights to well
earned rest. It was from here that be
came as a graduate student to Stanford.

school preparation. No man who passed
with an "A" grade has failed to make
good in scholarship.
One of the members of this year's
varsity baseball squad is a Federal Board
man, Professor Proctor said, and has#
played a good game all season. It was in
action in the Argonne that he received
his wound, and while lying among the
other wounded waiting for attention he
happened to smile at the stretcher
bearer who was taking men in to the
doctor, and so impressed the man, that
he was taken in and saved. The Ger
mans got everything but the nerve ''of
some of the students, the professor said;
and one of these who is working with
the Palo Alto American Legion, was re
cently conspicuous in cleaning up the
bootleggers and gold-brickers who were
operating there.
After obtaining his A.B. from Whit
man in '01, with Phi Beta Kappa honors,
Professor Proctor taught history and
civics in the Washington State Normal
School" at Cheney. In 1911 he accepted
the post as the professor of education at
Pacific University, of Oregon. In 1914—
15 Professor Proctor served in the ca
pacity of dean of the faculty at Pacific
University. Besides his classes and his
visitation work among the high schools
of Oregon and southern Washington, it
became his duty to hustle students and
address commencements and conduct all
the other activities incumbent upon deans
instead of giving up his nights to well
earned rest. It was from here that be
came as a graduate student to Stanford.
After receiving his master's degree at
Stanford in 1916, Professor William
t Martin Proctor was appointed instruc
• tor in the Education department, in
' which he is now associate professor.
Ever since his student days of *15 he
has been connected with the University,
except for war service, when he was
; principal and educational director of the
English School at Camp Fremont.
This school was supposed to teach
illiterates to speak and read English in
three months in order that the men
could join their units and get into action.
There were 800 men in attendance, 45
per cent of whom were Italians, and the
rest were distributed in birth among 33
other nationalities. '
Upon the disbanding of the school,
Professor Proctor spent some time at
the Presidio in vocational guidance of
discharged men, and at the same time
was engaged in teaching at Stanford as
an instructor and writing his thesis for a
Ph.D. After receiving his degree in
June, 1919, he was promoted to assistant
professor. Since October 1, 1919, he has
been co-educator for the Federal Board
for Vocational Education.
Starting with 20 Federal Board men,
the department has grown to 124. Any
ex-service man who has received injury
in the service, making it impossible for
him to continue working at his occupa
tion prior to army service, is entitled to
education which will fit him for another
occupation. The men receive their
tuition, books and $100 per month duripg
the period of their schooling. All kinds
of disabilities are suffered by the men
receiving this education, from gunshot
wounds to disease, but no man is per
mitted to attend the University, Profes
sor Proctor says, who has not passed a
very rigid physical examination, insur
ing his freedom from contagious disease.
The students attend under a special
ruling of the Board of Trustees which
disregards them as pertaining to the en
trance limitation. Federal Board men
are not considered as part of the 650 new
men admitted each year. The group has
maintained scholarship equal to or over
A

the men's average ever since its en
i trance, with the exception of one quar
ter. This is directly attributable to the
! careful supervision given to the men's
work.
All eligibility is decided by the Federal
Board. Some men are admitted on evi
dence discovered in psychology tests of
their ability, who have but two years of
high school training. Any man getting
a mark better than a "B" on Alpha
Army Test is admitted, and elimination
by the flunk-out route of this group is
smaller than of those having full high
school preparation. No man who passed
with an "A" grade has failed to make
good in scholarship.
