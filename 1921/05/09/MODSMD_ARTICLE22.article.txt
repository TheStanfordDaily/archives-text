# SMITHS LEAD FIELD IN ANNUAL TALLY OF THE 'BAWL-OUT'
## 
### 
Once more the clan of Smith reigns
supreme at Stanford. The new "bawl
out" containing the names of students for
all three quarters discloses the fact that
they have a lead of six over their most
popular rivals. There are 25 Smiths
registered from all over the United
States, while the Browns and Millers tie
i for second with a total of 19 each.
The Johnsons and Johnstons are near
| ly as numerous, 17 of them having regis
tered during the year- The Clark family
is becoming more numerous at Stanford,
since they rank just behind the Johnsons
with 16. The Davises, with 14 of them,
managed to beat out the Williames, who
have two less.
Figures for the total attendance for
each quarter show that the spring quar
ter, which usually has the smallest num
ber of students, is only about 100 behind
the autumn and winter, having 2329 stu
dents in attendance. The total for the
autumn quarter was 2495.
Outside of the lower division, in
which there are 529 students, the Eco
nomcis department is the most populous,
with a total of 393 majors; 174 are Eng
lish majors, while 166 arc specializing in
law. While Stanford draws its students
from all parts of the country, and even
from abroad, California is by far the best
represented, since 2047 come from this
state. Oregon and Washington are the
home states of 95 and 75, respectively.
One student registers from the Dutch
East Indies.
