# SAN JOSE HIGH IS VICTOR OVER LOCAL PREPS IN DUAL MEET
## 
### 
Palo Alto School lost the track
and baseball events Saturday to San
Jose on the latter's fields. The baseball
game ended 3-2. Palo Alto lost the game
in the first three innings. Howe retired
and Farrell held San Jose runless the
rest of the session. This does not affect
Palo Alto's championship standing in
the P. A. L. section, as this was a special
game.
The track meet went to San Jose by
a big score, 78-4s. None of Palo Alto's
stars showed up as well as previously,
partly due to the strange track. Lcistncr
won both hurdles and Charles won the
mile. l ast time in any of the events was
impossible because of the condition of
the track.
