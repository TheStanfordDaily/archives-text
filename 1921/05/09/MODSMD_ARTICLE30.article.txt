# DR. SAUNDERS TALKS ON CHINA RELATIONS
## Last Lecture of His Western Trip is on Subject of the Chinese and United States 
### 
Dr. Saunders, in his last appcaranco
on the campus, Sunday addressed two
assemblies, the Y. M. C. A. discussion
group at 10 o'clock and the congrega
tion at Memorial Church at 11 o'clock-
These were the last two of a series of
six lectures which Dr. Saunders has
been giving here Sundays.
"China and the United States" was
the title of the first lecture. He brought
out the point that China was not so
decadent a nation as is commonly sup
posed, as the Chinese have made as great
strides in tfce past fifteen years as the
Japanese have in fifty, which marks
them as an advancing people. A pecu
liar characteristic of the Chinese is their
adaptability and ability to quickly ac
cept reforms. Dr. Saunders mentioned
and pointed out as an example the over
throw of the Tartar dynasty, which was
accomplished by them almost over
night with scarcely any bloodshed, and
their quick grasp of Western civilization
since they have decided to accept it.
Dr. Saunders said that it is the West
-1 erner's place to enter the Orient not as
an offici«us know-it-all who tries to force
his methods and ideas upon them, but
rather as a merchant who displays his
wares for choice, for if the Chinese are
to make their characteristic contribution
! to civilization they must be allowed to
select their own course. He suggested
the best policy for the United States as
being first one of understanding; sec
ondly, one of appreciation, and lastly,
one of helpfulness.
The subject of the sermon was "The
Challenge of the Orient to th« Christian
Nations." He pictured the Christian
faith as standing on probation in the
Orient. The speaker asid that it was
such pictures as th&t of Queen Victoria,
surrounded by the statesmen of the time,
, proffering the Bible to the benighted
African while saying that it was Chris
tianity which made England the power
that it was, which painted at the same
time as in real life these very statesmen
were ordering the bombardment of a
Chinese port in order to force the opium
traffic upon them for England's benefit
that kept the East skeptic- That, Dr.
Saunders said, is the general impression
among the Orientals concerning the
Christian nations, that contrary to all
teachings, the Western nations are char
acterized by the fact that the first place
you enter upon landing is the customs
house. The Easterners fear that it is
gold, not souls, which is the ultimate
aim, and consequently fear that Chris
tianity is not big enough for a world
religion. The standing by of the big
Christian nations, with avowed ideals,
while China is overrdden and the dis
putes of the two greatest Christian na
tions over the Mesopotamia oil mandate,
fortifies their doubts, Dr. Saunders said.
Idealism and materialism must be
chosen between soon, he said, and the
true idea of Christ as a surgeon as well
as a physician, doing good things as well
as saying them, must stand out devoid
of the wishy-washy sentimentalism with
which religion in general is clothed. The
purer Christian practice of the Buddhist
king who forestalled war by personal
combat must become the representation
of Christianity practically as well as
theoretically before a leader can be
found to guide the East and the West
out of the present slough of materialism,
was the conclusion of Dr. Saunders'
sermon.

such pictures as th&t of Queen Victoria,
surrounded by the statesmen of the time,
, proffering the Bible to the benighted
African while saying that it was Chris
tianity which made England the power
that it was, which painted at the same
time as in real life these very statesmen
were ordering the bombardment of a
Chinese port in order to force the opium
traffic upon them for England's benefit
that kept the East skeptic- That, Dr.
Saunders said, is the general impression
among the Orientals concerning the
Christian nations, that contrary to all
teachings, the Western nations are char
acterized by the fact that the first place
you enter upon landing is the customs
house. The Easterners fear that it is
gold, not souls, which is the ultimate
aim, and consequently fear that Chris
tianity is not big enough for a world
religion. The standing by of the big
Christian nations, with avowed ideals,
while China is overrdden and the dis
putes of the two greatest Christian na
tions over the Mesopotamia oil mandate,
fortifies their doubts, Dr. Saunders said.
Idealism and materialism must be
chosen between soon, he said, and the
true idea of Christ as a surgeon as well
as a physician, doing good things as well
as saying them, must stand out devoid
of the wishy-washy sentimentalism with
which religion in general is clothed. The
purer Christian practice of the Buddhist
king who forestalled war by personal
combat must become the representation
of Christianity practically as well as
theoretically before a leader can be
found to guide the East and the West
out of the present slough of materialism,
was the conclusion of Dr. Saunders'
sermon.
Dr. Saunders, in his last appcaranco
on the campus, Sunday addressed two
assemblies, the Y. M. C. A. discussion
group at 10 o'clock and the congrega
tion at Memorial Church at 11 o'clock-
These were the last two of a series of
six lectures which Dr. Saunders has
been giving here Sundays.
"China and the United States" was
the title of the first lecture. He brought
out the point that China was not so
decadent a nation as is commonly sup
posed, as the Chinese have made as great
strides in tfce past fifteen years as the
Japanese have in fifty, which marks
them as an advancing people. A pecu
liar characteristic of the Chinese is their
adaptability and ability to quickly ac
cept reforms. Dr. Saunders mentioned
and pointed out as an example the over
throw of the Tartar dynasty, which was
accomplished by them almost over
night with scarcely any bloodshed, and
their quick grasp of Western civilization
since they have decided to accept it.
Dr. Saunders said that it is the West
-1 erner's place to enter the Orient not as
an offici«us know-it-all who tries to force
his methods and ideas upon them, but
rather as a merchant who displays his
wares for choice, for if the Chinese are
to make their characteristic contribution
! to civilization they must be allowed to
select their own course. He suggested
the best policy for the United States as
being first one of understanding; sec
ondly, one of appreciation, and lastly,
one of helpfulness.
The subject of the sermon was "The
Challenge of the Orient to th« Christian
Nations." He pictured the Christian
faith as standing on probation in the
Orient. The speaker asid that it was
such pictures as th&t of Queen Victoria,
surrounded by the statesmen of the time,
, proffering the Bible to the benighted
African while saying that it was Chris
tianity which made England the power
that it was, which painted at the same
