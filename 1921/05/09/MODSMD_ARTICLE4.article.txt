# SPRING FOOTBALL IS BRINGING OUT NEW TURF POSSIBILITIES
## 
### 
Friday closed the fourth week of
spring football practice. Coach Walter
Powell says that the prospects for next
year's gridiron squad are very good. He
has developed about 18 or 20 new men
who have shown up very well, consider
ing the short time they have had in
which to master the intricate details of
a sport which was entirely new to most
of them. The only complaint which the
coach has to make is that there are not
enough good men out. The men who
arc out are good but a group of seven or
eight reserves is not large enough to
carry the team through a season such
as faces the Cardinal varsity next falj.
