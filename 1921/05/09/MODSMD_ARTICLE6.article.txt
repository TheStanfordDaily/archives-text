# CHEMISTS CINCH FIFTH LEAGUE FLAG

### 
Alpha Chi Sigma won the champion
ship of League Five last Thursday by
defeating the Delta Upsilon nine in a
close game which ended 5 to 4. When
the last inning arrived, the score was
tied at 4 all. Aspinwall beat a throw to
first and stole second. Demond fol
lowed with a hard grounded through sec
ond base territory, bringing in Aspin
wall for the championship tally. Demond,
attempting to steal home, was caught in
a hot-box and put out on a doubtful de
cision. The Delta Upsilon batters were
unable to bunch enough hits to net the
necessary runs in their last trip to the
plate. This victory gives the holders of
the coveted plaque a clean record con
taining five straight wins.
Four muffed grounders and two hits
in the initial period were responsible
for three of the chemistry sharks' five
tallies. The losers scorcd twice in the
first frame and once in both the second
and third. Cornish of the Delta Upsilon
outfit clouted out one of the longest hits
of the intramural season, the white
sphere traveling across the diamond of
a sccond baseball field. Ralph Carver of
the same team hurled to good effect,
striking out eleven to Aspinwall's six.
Phi Delta Tlieta took Alpha Kappa
Lambda down the line to the tune of 7 to
2. Clark, mounjlsman of the former
aggregation, was the individual star of
