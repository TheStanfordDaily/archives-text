# CALL FOR HELP OF STUDENTS COMES TO STANFORD FROM EAST
## United States Universities Are Taking Active Part In Help of Stricken People 
### 
The # call of the Near East Relief,
which has come to' Stanford, to main
tain orphanages for the 110,000 home
less children in the Near East countries,
is sent as an appeal, not as a drive, ac
cording to the National Committee. The
Relief has issued books of sixty cou
pons, representing the life of a child for
one year, and the appeal is for the citi
zens of this country to make good the
responsibility which was accepted by
America when the relief work was au
thorized by Congress in 1919 by taking
sufficient coupons to provide for the des
titute children.
\ arious colleges throughout the coun
try have already established a precc>T*
of adopting a certain number of the
children by buying the coupon books.
Harvard is now taking care of 30 or
phans in this way, and Botson University
is providing for 23. Vassar has con
tributed $13,000.
Returns from the California institu
tions show a sum of $3750 from the
University of Southern California and
$1500 from the University of Redlands,
which is an average of $5 to a student!
'I he complete results have not yet been
obtained at* the University of California,
but so far the women's sororities alone
have contributed $1300, and the report
from the Southern Branch of the Uni
versity of California shows $4380
pledged.

The importance of the American re
lief work in Armenia is shown by the
statement of the prime minister of that
country: "The Armenian people appre
ciate the assistance that the American
people have given them during the last
two years. America literally saved us
from starvation." The Armenian and
other peoples of the NeaV East countries
do not want charity; they are willing to
work, but due to the devastated condition
of their country and total lack of food,
except for that sent in to them, they are
unable to do so. Their only salvation
lies in the aid that America can give
them until a responsible government can
raise the capital to develop the resources
of the country.

California stood at the top of all of
the states in proportion to her quota last
year, and the Relief is placing every con
fidence in a similar response this year.
