# FOUR CARDINAL TRACKSTERS WILL GO EAST FOR I.C.A.A.A.A MEET
## KIRKSEY, WILLIAMS WELLS AND FALK TO ENTER COMPETITION 
### 
Four men will represent the Cardinal this year in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet
in Boston. Kirksey, Bob Williams, Lane Falk, and Jess Wells will leave bcro
the twentieth and arrive in the eastern city about May 24. The big meet is on
May 27, aud the four entrants from Stanford are all figured to show something
pretty good in point gathering. Kenny Wright and Art Wilsox cannot make
the arrangements for getting away from their scholastic work and so will be
unable to make the trip. Due to conflicting times of the Eastern meet and the
Pacific Coast Conference classic, there will be no team entered from .Stanford
in the latter.
Captain Kirksey and Jess Wells were point winners in the meet luld in the
East last year, and are expected to gathir in more than before this season. In
jury to the Cardinal sprinter's leg last year kept him out of the finals in the fur
long when lie was making a bid to tal-eaway the event. This time he is going

in first class shape and should be able to
break the string in both the century and
the 220. ' â€¢ '
Jess Wells has had a varying season,
having shown well in one meet and down
in the next- His season was broken in
the middle by having to go home in the
midst of training, but he staged a come
back in the California meet that put him
once more in the lead of the hurdlers-.
Bob Williams and Lane Falk have
been going good all season in the hurdle
events, and in addition Wdhams is
figured to make something of a sensa
tion in the jumps.
