# CARDINAL TRACK MEN INVITED TO "BIG TEN" MEET
## Templeton Will be Unable to Accept Offer; Condition of Men is Chief Reason Given 
### 
Graduate Manager Ed. Martin has
received an invitation from Chicago for
the Stanford track team to enter the
I. C. A. A. track and field meet to be
held on Stagg Field at the University of
Chicago, June 4, 1921. With the de
cision to enter the Cardinal four-man
team in the I. C. A. A. meet at Boston
on May 27-28, it was thought advisable
by Coach Templeton to decline the offer
of entrance in the Middle Western
as the men will not have time to recover
from the effects of the first competition
and will be worn out from travel.
Furthermore, the stop at Chicago would
cause several days' delay in teh men
getting back to their academic work, and
it was only after prolonged arrange
ments that they obtained sufficient leave
of absence for the Boston meet.
The I. C. A. A. organization is the
Middle Western group which are com
monly known as the "Big Ten." They
are not members of the I. C. A. A. A. A.
for the reason that the meets have al
ways conflicted as to dates. The 1. C.
A. A. A. A. organization is the Inter
collegiate Association of Amateur Ath
letes of America and was founded in
1876. It is composed of the following
schools: Amherst, Boston, XBuivdoin,
Brown, California, Cincinnati, , "â‚¬olby,
College City of New YrjrfcrtGplumbia,
Cornell, Dartmouth, Fordhalft,M"ichrge
town, Harvard, Haverford, Hoy Cross,
Johns lHopkins, Lafayette. Stan
ford; Massachusetts Jnstitute of
Technology, Michigan, New York Uni
versity, Pennsylvania State, Pennsyl
vania, Pittsburgh, Princeton, Rutgers,
Swarthmore, Syracuse, Williams, and
Yale.
In 1916 "Feg" Murray of Stanford
won the 120-yard high hurdles in 15
seconds flat and established what is still
the I. C. A. A. A. A. record in this event.
In the same year he won the low hurdles
in 24 seconds flat. Because of the dis
tance of the trip it has been impossible
for Stanford to enter many teams in the
Eastern meet and the few men sent have
won 22 points.
