# TRIO WILL GIVE RECITAL TONIGHT
## Orley See, W. W. Carruth and W. Villalpando to Present Program in Little Theatre 
### 
The Philharmonic Trio, composed of
Orley See, violinist; Wenceslao Villal
pando, 'cellist, and William W. Carruth,
pianist, will give a concert in the Little-
Theater at 7:30 this evening.
Orley See has been playing in public
since the age of 7. Since then he has
trained under such violinists as Mar
cosson, Heermann and Spiering. He
was formerly a member of the Cincin
nati Symphony Orchestra, and during
seven seasons participated in the musical
life at Chautauqua, New York. For
eight years he served as head of the
violin and orchestra department at con
servatories of music in the Middle West.
Mr. See and Mr. Villalpando are both
members of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra and appeared in the
concerts, which that organization gave at
Stanford last winter.
This is the first season in which these
three musicians have worked together,
but all of them have had several years of
experience in concert work. They in
tend to present the serious and experi
enced musicianship of the individual
members of the trio, with the ensemble
perfected through months of rehearsing.
The Philharmonic Trio will offer the
following program:
Trio, Op. 49 Mendelssohn
Violin soloâ€”Romance in G major
Beethoven
Waves at Play Grasse
Prelude and Allegro.... Pugnani-Kreisler
Trio, Op. 15 Smotana
