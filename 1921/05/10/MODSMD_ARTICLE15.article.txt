### 
Steven Vuyavitch, campus laborer, was murdered at his home near the
rock quarry about a mile from the Quad, early this morning, and Nick Jaro
mos, woodsman, is being held in the county jail in San Joee as a suspect,
following his discovery at daylight this morning in a yard near the Hoo-Hoo
House, where he was washing blood from his hands. Jaromos was on the
University payroll as a laborer until March 31, of this year.
When Fred Frehe, campus policeman, was called to the scene by Mrs.
Vuyavitch, shortly before 1 o'clock this morning, he found the man lying in
the yard, dead, with his face and throat slashed. According to the wife's
story, two masked men appeared at the house at midnight, asked Vuyavitch

to step outside, and demanded money
and liquor. After they had searched
the house and taken $30 and some
brandy, a third man whistled from
the yard, and the others left. Going
to the yard a few minutes later, Mrs.
Vuyavitch says she found her husband
dead.
Mrs. Vuyavitch and Jaromos had
been on intimate terms with each
other, according to Sheriff P. 1). Lyle
of San Jor.e. Sheriff Lyle expressed
the belief this morning that the wife's "
story was a fabrication. Jaromos de
nies any knowledge of the murder but
admitted that he had frequently gone
to the Vuyavitch home. He was un
able to explain the precence of blood
on his hands when he was found by
Deputy Sheriffs Hamilton, Almericb
and Frehe, in the yard of Millen Bu
dlntich, near the Hoo-Hoo House.
Valdo Vuyavitch, nine-year-old son
of the murdered man, was recently
injured in an automobile accident in
front of the Stanford Bookstore. Be
sides the wife, there remains another
son, six-years-old. Vuyavitch had
been employed on the campus since
he came from Jugo-Slovakia with his
family several years ago. They were '
said to have been laboring under fi
nancial difficulties, involved when t
they came to this eoiintry.
Mrs. Vuwavitcli and the two chil
dren. were removed to the sheriff'*
office at San Jose this afternoon. No *
charge has been placed against her.
