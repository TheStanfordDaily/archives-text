# A 						SMALL GROUP OF ELIGIBLES
## 
### 
Statistics on the eligibility of men for athletic competition released
from the gymnasium offices last week bring home with a shock to many
the very limited number of men from which Stanford develops teams to
compete in some fifteen or more intercollegiate sports. The limited
number is not an unusual handicap for Stanford. Former Graduate
Manager W. 1. Ames stated in 1919 that according to his investigations
there were never more than 700 men eligible. Dr. Browne's figures
accurately bring the number down to 538 for the quarter just ended.
This does not present a new problem for Stanford athletics. But
it shows that the teams of the past have been produced from a small body
of men by bare spirit and enthusiasm for sports together with a deter
mination to develop every possible member of the 538 into some kind
of a competition athlete.
The small number will show how much we must suffer from any
Other handicap that may take away as much as one possible competitor.
It shows, too, what a strong spirit, enthusiasm, determination, and the
' development" idea has done for the Cardinal prestige, for what else
could make of a few hundred men any kind of competition for groups
of several thousands. It shows, too, just where a lark of these elements,
or a slipping back in their intensity, will place Stanford now.
