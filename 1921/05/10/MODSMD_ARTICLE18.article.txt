# TRACK COMPETITION

### 
The decision of the Board of Control to send a team to the I. C. A.
A. A. A. meet in Boston is welcomed by every member of the student
body. With the decision there are only two regrets, that the athletes
to make the trip number only four, and that the possibility of taking
part in the Pacific Coast Conference meet is prohibited.
The motion of the board reads to "send not more than a six-man
team." Could Captain-elect Wright, Art Wilcox, or any other qualified
men make satisfactory arrangements with instructors that will not pre
vent their entering competition next year also, it is possible that one or
two additions might be made to the squad of four announced. Yet it
seems hardly possible for them to effect such arrangements at present.
It is to be regretted that California and Stanford are both out of the
Coast Conference meet. The Cardinal team of three intercollegiate
champions, in addition to one or two other stars, would have shown very
well in a six-university meet against teams of all-round, well-balanced
character.

THERE ARE ALWAYS TWO SIDES to a question. The Daily is
glad to print today the viewpoint of a rough who knows an "unreason
able few" outside of his own ranks.
