# INTRAMURAL BASEBALL NOW IN FIFTH WEEK
## 
### 
One of the tightest games of the
intramural season was played last
night between Alpha Tau Omega and
Zeta Psi in which the former gained
the long end of a four to one score.
Both moundsmen pitched good ball,
Sutton of the victors, allowing four
hits, and Filley, of Zeta Psi, five. In
the first inning, Phelps, Taylor, and
Sutton led off for Alpha Tau Omega
with three hits, each one of which was
later converted into a run. R. Kin
ney, Zete shortstop, reached first on
a walk in the second period and
traveled., around., the., bases., for his
team's only score before the follow
ing three batters went out. A one
two-three retirement was accepted by
each contingent in the next frame,
Sutton fanning three batsmen in a
row. Moir, captain and star infielder
for the winners, connected with the
horsehide cover, the following inning,
and swatted out the only long hit of
the game which netted him an easy
trip around the diamond. Three Zeta
Psi men reached first in their last
trip to the plate, but were unable to
score.
Theta Xi spoiled Delta Chi's thou
sand per cent average by taking a
twenty to fourteen victory. Batting
percentages went sky high in the last
few innings when the winning slug
gers spiked the home platter fifteen
times. They were closely followed
by Delta Chi men who lacked only
three runs of making the same record.
Reed accounted for three of Theta
Xi's tallies by finding Coplen for a
homer with two on bases.
The Breakers broke heavily against
Kappa Alpha's opposition and annex
ed eight runs to the latter's four. Five
of the boosts towards the final score
came in a fourth inning hitting-fest.
Theta Delta Chi took Delta Tau
Delta's men down a peg by allowing
them a single tally to their own six.
Barham and Anderson were the slug
sters for the Tliela Delt aggregation,
each being responsible for two runs.
The Japanese Club batted Sequoia's
first and third team completely off
the field by a 26-5 landslide. Mizota
was the high man on the slab-ticket,
for the Japanese players, and succeed
ed in making each of his five trips
to bat count a tally for his team.
