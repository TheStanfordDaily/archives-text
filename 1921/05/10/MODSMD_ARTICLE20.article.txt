# Professor Cathcart is forceful Lecturer; Active in Civic Affairs
## 
### 
Professor Arthur Martin Cathcart of
the Law department has that rare quality
of personality which enables him to
combine dry humor and quiet sincerity
in a way which has won for him a high
place in the, regard of his students. In
speaking of Professor Cathcart and his
work, a fellow member of the depart
ment said: "His clear exposition of the
law is lighted up by many flashes of dry
humor and he has been known by stu
dents as a professor of, particular ef
fectiveness." He has a way of destroy
ing the barrier between student and
teacher, and the result has been a feel
ing of genuine esteem and good-will
from the students. His rebukes, in cases
where this is necessary, are free from
sting and are kindly put, yet they possess
an equally stimulating effect with the
harsh attitude which casts the professor
and his student apart and destroys un
derstanding. He is especially noted fof
his humorous allusions to the human
element in politics.
Professor Cathcart was born in
Attica, lowa, February 2, 1873, and grad
uated from the Knoxville High School.
He spent two years at Northwestern
University, and came from there to
Stanford, receiving his A. H- here in
1896. He attended the Harvard Law
School in 1896-7, and was admitted to
the bar in 1903. After a year in practice
at Colorado Springs he came back to
Stanford as instructor in the Law de
partment and has been here steadily
since, receiving a full professorship in
1909.
He has been very active as an alumnus
and his familiarity with the points of
view of both students and faculty has
made him a useful leader in the work
of university administration. Among the
important university policies which he
has helped to carry out is the introduc
tion of the Lower Division. He was
chairman of the advisory committee
which recommended its organization,
and helped to plan the movement. Pro

fessor Cathcart's activities have not been
confined to the University, for he has
taken an active part in the civic affairs
of Palo Alto and the county. For sev
eral years he has been a member of the
Palo Alto council and is now mayor.
His administration will be remembered
for his services in connection with the
gift of Mrs. Leroy Dixon which is to
provide the city with a public park. His
civic and patriotic ideas, coupled with
the gift of public speaking, have made
him much in demand as a speaker for
occasions in the community and other
parts of the state-
While a student of Stanford, Profes
sor Cathcart was active in debating, and
represented the University on intercol
legiate teams in 1894-96. He was one of
the founders of Euphronia Debating So
ciety and his interest in society and
in all debating activity has continued to
the present time. One of the interesting
incidents of his student days is a walking
trip into Yosemite with three com
panions. They outfitted at Stockton and
approached the park by way of Angels
Camp and Calaveras. When coming out
they took the trail by way of Wavvona
and climbed Mt. Hoffman. Later in the
same summer he took a hiking trip to
Kings River Canyon. Mountain hiking
and climbing has been Professor Cath
cart's favorite sport since his youth, and
for the last ten years he lias been in the
mountains every summer. During the
school months he finds relaxation and
enjoyment in caring for his garden in
Palo Alto, and it is a particularly fine
one.
Professor Cathcart is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa—being president of the
Stanford chapter this year, Delta Chi,
Order of the Coif. Delta Sigma Kho,
and Delta Upsilon. His writings in
clude: "Damages and Public Service
Corporations and Carriers in American
Law and Procedure"; "Negligence, in
Library of American Law- and Prac
tice": "Qua.ii Contracts, in Modern
American Law."

an equally stimulating effect with the

his humorous allusions to the human
element in politics.
Professor Cathcart was born in
Attica, lowa, February 2, 1873, and grad
uated from the Knoxville High School.
He spent two years at Northwestern
University, and came from there to
Stanford, receiving his A. H- here in
1896. He attended the Harvard Law
School in 1896-7, and was admitted to
the bar in 1903. After a year in practice
at Colorado Springs he came back to
Stanford as instructor in the Law de
partment and has been here steadily
since, receiving a full professorship in
1909.
He has been very active as an alumnus
and his familiarity with the points of
view of both students and faculty has
made him a useful leader in the work
of university administration. Among the
important university policies which he
has helped to carry out is the introduc
tion of the Lower Division. He was
chairman of the advisory committee
which recommended its organization,
and helped to plan the movement. Pro

fessor Cathcart's activities have not been
confined to the University, for he has
taken an active part in the civic affairs
of Palo Alto and the county. For sev
eral years he has been a member of the
Palo Alto council and is now mayor.
His administration will be remembered
for his services in connection with the
gift of Mrs. Leroy Dixon which is to
provide the city with a public park. His
civic and patriotic ideas, coupled with
the gift of public speaking, have made
him much in demand as a speaker for
occasions in the community and other
parts of the state-
While a student of Stanford, Profes
sor Cathcart was active in debating, and
represented the University on intercol
legiate teams in 1894-96. He was one of
the founders of Euphronia Debating So
ciety and his interest in society and
in all debating activity has continued to
the present time. One of the interesting
incidents of his student days is a walking
trip into Yosemite with three com
panions. They outfitted at Stockton and
approached the park by way of Angels
Camp and Calaveras. When coming out
they took the trail by way of Wavvona
and climbed Mt. Hoffman. Later in the
same summer he took a hiking trip to
Kings River Canyon. Mountain hiking
and climbing has been Professor Cath
cart's favorite sport since his youth, and
for the last ten years he lias been in the
mountains every summer. During the
school months he finds relaxation and
enjoyment in caring for his garden in
Palo Alto, and it is a particularly fine
one.
Professor Cathcart is a member of
Phi Beta Kappa—being president of the
Stanford chapter this year, Delta Chi,
Order of the Coif. Delta Sigma Kho,
and Delta Upsilon. His writings in

American Law."
Professor Arthur Martin Cathcart of
the Law department has that rare quality
of personality which enables him to
combine dry humor and quiet sincerity
in a way which has won for him a high
place in the, regard of his students. In
speaking of Professor Cathcart and his
work, a fellow member of the depart
ment said: "His clear exposition of the
law is lighted up by many flashes of dry
humor and he has been known by stu
dents as a professor of, particular ef
fectiveness." He has a way of destroy
ing the barrier between student and
teacher, and the result has been a feel
ing of genuine esteem and good-will
from the students. His rebukes, in cases
where this is necessary, are free from
sting and are kindly put, yet they possess
an equally stimulating effect with the
harsh attitude which casts the professor
and his student apart and destroys un
derstanding. He is especially noted fof
