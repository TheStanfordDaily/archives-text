Using a barge as a foundation
wasn't the only novel thing about the
fireworks the other night. They seem
ed to be of a novel make—probably
delayed fuses. Maybe th#y were all
timed displays and the watches stop
ped. / Anyway, both the people who
stopped to see 'em said they appeared
at a novel hour.

We hear that an English major liv
ing in Roble posted a sign the other
day. Her composition was as follows:
"Wanted —Small hat for riding horse."
An answer posted beneath: "What
size?" if horses need protection from
sun stroke and burn, it is quite likely
Major Collins will furnish the neces
sary articles.

A parallel can easily be drawn be
tween the Varsity ball game with
Pally last Saturday and the proposed
contest between the Daily staff and
the Press gang. Trouble is, both sides
are lighting to prove that they are on
the right side of the 23 to 0 score.
In this case, its not blood, but Satur
day that will tell.

The worst we've yet seen in blank
verse is the following blankest of the
free:
1 am a blotter;
A dumb, absorbing.
Gripping, grasping
Blotter.
And there is naught
To satiate or satisfy
My appetite.
I daily strive for more
And getting more
Continue.
Alas, I am a
Human Blotter;
Knowledge do I blot
And blotting know I gotter
Be a blotter
To keep away from
Smoke-ups.
