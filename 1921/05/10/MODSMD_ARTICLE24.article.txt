# HARVARD SCHOOL OF BUSINESS EXPERTS RECORD ENROLLMENT
## 
### 
The Harvard School of Business Ad
ministration has received to date 150 ap
plications for admission to the first-year
class of the school for next year. Sev
eral Stanford seniors have indicated in
tention of attending this school next
year.
The requirements for admission to the
first year for this group were unchanged
last year except for the requirement of
a registration fee of $10. Applications
from now on, however, must be accom
panied by a complete transcript of the
man's college record and the school re
serves the right to reject any applicant-
At this time last year no formal appli
cations for admission to the school had
been received, and yet at the opening of
the school year in the fall over 300 men
were enrolled in the first-year class. The
faculty of the Business School has voted
to limit the first-year class to 300 in
order that the quality of the instruction
may not be impaired by large numbers
and that no more men may be admitted
than can be taken care of. Notwith
standing the increase in the tuition fee
of the Business School to $400 next year,
applications have been received which
more than half fill next year's first-year
class.
If applications continue to come in at
the current rate, registration probably
will be closed about Commencement
week.
