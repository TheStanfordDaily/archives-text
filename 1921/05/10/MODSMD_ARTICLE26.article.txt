"THERE IS TOO GENERAL A
TENDENCY AGAINST TH E
ROUGHING IDEA," DECLARES
AN OLD-TIMER.
It is the olcl cry again: "You roughs
are not gentlemen." While I do not be
lieve that the author of "An Unreason
able hew" is against the roughing cus
tom, yet it seems that the discussion
against the certain practices on the En
gineering Corner may add to a tendency
that is becoming all too general in con
demnation of the Stanford rough.
Many of the agitators against the
Stanford rough would .offer us as a
model one of the bandolined beauties
whom we see playing bridge with the
co-eds on the sorority lawns or gleefully
knocking the golf balls up and down the
row and then resting from the strenuous
exercise on their favorite sorority porch,
or one of the "ninety per" type manfully
driving his powerful Stutz or Mercer at
a wild .daring, nerve-wrecking speed.
Are these same so-called gentlemen the
favorites of Coach Powell? Are they
the men that are the real leaders? Arc
they the men of the Hoover stamp who
will accomplish big things in the busi
ness world ?
The engineering rough has existed
since the founding of the University.
Look at the records and see how many
of them are today big men in the world.
Look at the records that a later genera
tion of the engineering roughs made in
the recent world war, and before the war
the Engineering Corner was a great deal
"rougher" than it is today. Lt'k at the
records and see how many of the present
representatives of Stanford on the ath
letic teams are engineering roughs. Who
is the true type of Stanford, man, the
"center-hair part" or the so-called
rough ?
It is true that there are some very
direct comments made at the Engineer
ing Corner about the dress of some of
the 500, but where does the blame lie?
When a co-ed ti*ies to imitate one of
Mack Sennett's beauties her sole pur
pose and desire is to attract attention â€”
then why blame the rough if she is sue
cessful? The sober-minded woman
knows that an unreasonable few ca cds
overstep the boundary of modesty and
common sense and she should lie able
to stop them, but if she can't then don't
blame the rouyli. "A ROUGH." '19.
