# AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY RECEIVED BY IOTA SIGMA PI
## 
### 
lota Sigma Pi members of the Stan
ford and California chapters attended
the 124 th regular meeting of the Cali
fornia section of the American Chemical
Society, which was held in the rooms of
the San Francisco Commercial Club in
San Francisco on Saturday evening.
The evening was devoted to a program
arranged by the women of the section.
Professor B. Bray of the University
of California Chemistry department pre
sided at the meeting, which he opened
with a brief discourse as to the scope
and accomplishments of the organiza
tion. The first speaker on the program
was Dr. Agnes Fay Morgan of the pro
gram committee. Due to her position,
she has remained in contact with many
women graduates in chemistry, and she
made a general account of what they
were doing, the basis of her talk. Dr.
Morgan emphasized her conviction that
there was a large field in chemical work
open to women and that they were
capable of doing far more than merely
routine work.
"Blood Regeneration as Influenced by
Dietary Factors" was the subject of the
lecture given by Freda S. Robbins, in
which she spoke of the research work
which she has been doing on the subject
in the Hooper Foundation for Medical
Research. Lantern slides were used to
illustrate her explanations. Hester E. H.
Branch, who is a graduate student in
chemistry in the University of Califor
nia, told of some of the "By-products of
Research in Organic Chemistry," in the
concluding address of the evening.
A dinner given by the two Iota Sigma
Pi chapters preceded the meeting.
Among the guests were many graduate
alumnae of the socity who are now in
structors in chemistry in the various
educational institutions of the bay
region.
