### 
The San Francisco Chronicle of Sun
day contained a denial by President Wil
bur that Dr. Albert Abrams, who has re
cently been given much publicity in con
nection with a number of startling
scientific ideas, particularly in connec
tion with the determination of a child's
parentage by blood tests, was ever con
nected with Stanford University. A
number, of newspaper articles dealing
with startling scientific discoveries which
Dr. Abrams was credited with speak of
him as having been for a number of
years a professor at Stanford. He was
for a time connected with Cooper Medi
cal College, but had left that institution
many years before it became the medi
cal school of Stanford University.
