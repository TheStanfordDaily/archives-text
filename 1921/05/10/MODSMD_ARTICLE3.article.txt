# ORGAN PROGRAM HAS SPRING-TIME THEME
## 
### 
At his recital this afternoon, Warren
D. Allen, University organist, pave a
number by Schubert which he himself
had transcribed for the organ. Allen's
program today was light and varied and
held the spirit of spring. All of his
numbers were written with the idea of
lauding and expressing spring except the
last.
Allen's program was:
Chant de Printemps Joseph T?onnet
Fchoes of Spring Rudolph Friml
Spring Song Mendelssohn
Faith in Spring Schubert
(Transcribed for the organ by
W. D. Allen)
Rhapsody in D major... Rossetter G. Cole
Allen gave this same program last
Sunday. His next recital will be Thurs
day afternoon, when he will give an
American program.
