# University Will Observe Holiday On Memorial Day
## 
### 
Decoration Day, May 30, will be
a University holiday. This de
cision has been made by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises with
the idea that hereafter Decoration
Day will be annually a holiday ob
served with a fitting program.
No program has been arranged
for this year. Formerly Memorial
Day fell after the University had
closed and on the three years since
the establishment of the four quar
ter system there have been pro
grams which have been largely
musical and in the Memorial
Church. This year, however, the
efforts of all the musical interests
of the University community will
be centered on the concert pro
duction of "Faust," which is to be
presented on Tuesday, May 31.
In future, after the erection
of the War Memorial, Decoration
Day observances will naturally
center in that huild'nfr.
