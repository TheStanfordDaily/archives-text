An Alumni Day which is not an
Alumni Day! That is the phrase which
describes the celebration on the campus
Saturday afternoon and evening. At

Sunset, gives assurance that the program
of the day has been so shaped that it
hears little ilesemblance to the customary
reunion of alumni. The day, Field de

day Stanford students.
In the Saturday celebration members

in speaking of the day, "and Saturday

body to extend a genuine welcome to
them."
Committees of students will meet the
alumni in the Memorial Court at 2:30 in
the afternoon. Following a short in
formal reception, each student will an

terest on the campus. The aim will not

be to conduct a miniature "Cook's
Tour," but to acquaint the visitors with
present-day conditions at Stanford.
A varied athletic and stunt program
has been arranged for the afternoon
which, it is expected, a majority of the
visitors will desire to see. From 3 to 4
ufcloQk a tennis tournament and an
aquatic meet will be in progress simul
taneously- A snappy polo match will
fill the time from 4 to 4:45 in which a
picked student team will contest a squad
representing the officers and enlisted
men stationed at Stanford. Warren D.
Allen will present a short musical pro
gram from 5 to 5:30 in the Memorial
Church.
Following the concert the committee
is planning a very informal reception of
alumni in the different houses and halls
on the campus. Student committeemen
who are in charge of the alumni will in
vite them to their house or hall for a
few minutes' visit It is hoped that
members of the house or hall will be
present to extend a Stanford welcome to
the visitors. The informal reception
will end at 6:30, as the dinner at Roblc
begins a half an hour later.

An Alumni Day which is not an
Alumni Day! That is the phrase which
describes the celebration on the campus
Saturday afternoon and evening. At
least Charles K. Field, editor of the
Sunset, gives assurance that the program
of the day has been so shaped that it
hears little ilesemblance to the customary
reunion of alumni. The day, Field de
clares, will not he devoted to a rehash
ing of the glories of long graduated
classes. Stanford alumni from all over
California, and a few from outside the
boundaries of the state, will gather nn
the campus to witness the University
plant in operation anti to meet present
day Stanford students.
In the Saturday celebration members
of the student body will fill an important
and necessary place. "For the past year
students have constantly declared their
desire to bring the alumni in closer re
lation to Stanford," F&yd McElroy said
in speaking of the day, "and Saturday
we will have exactly the opportunity to
accomplish this aim. The live-wire
alumni of San Francisco and many other
cities will be on the campus Saturday
and it will be the place of the student
body to extend a genuine welcome to
them."
Committees of students will meet the
alumni in the Memorial Court at 2:30 in
the afternoon. Following a short in
formal reception, each student will an
nex one or two of the visitors and tour
the alumni around newer points of in
terest on the campus. The aim will not

be to conduct a miniature "Cook's
Tour," but to acquaint the visitors with
present-day conditions at Stanford.
A varied athletic and stunt program
has been arranged for the afternoon
which, it is expected, a majority of the
visitors will desire to see. From 3 to 4
ufcloQk a tennis tournament and an
aquatic meet will be in progress simul
taneously- A snappy polo match will
fill the time from 4 to 4:45 in which a
picked student team will contest a squad
representing the officers and enlisted
men stationed at Stanford. Warren D.
Allen will present a short musical pro
gram from 5 to 5:30 in the Memorial
Church.
Following the concert the committee
is planning a very informal reception of
alumni in the different houses and halls
on the campus. Student committeemen
who are in charge of the alumni will in
vite them to their house or hall for a
few minutes' visit It is hoped that
members of the house or hall will be
present to extend a Stanford welcome to
the visitors. The informal reception
will end at 6:30, as the dinner at Roblc
begins a half an hour later.
This evening representatives of all the
living groups on the campus wi'l meet
