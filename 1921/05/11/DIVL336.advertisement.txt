YOU HAVE WRITTEN POEMS!
Do you care to have them revised
or constructively criticised by success
ful authors? If you do, then send us
your manuscript (stories, articles or
poems). We will criticise, and place
them should they prove to be accept

There is no actual charge for our
services. If, however, you have not

department of this association, we re
quest that you enclose the initial fee

each new contributor. There is no
additional expense, no future obliga
tion.
It must be realized that we can only
be of aid to those of serious intent. If
you do mean to strive for literary suc
cess, we can help you in many ways.
Our services are yours until we have
I actually succeeded in marketing at
least one of your manuscripts. Send
something today!
Please enclose return postage with
