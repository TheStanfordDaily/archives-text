3> No cause is more worthy of the <S>
<?> attention of Stanford people than <S>
<$> that of the Near East Relief, is the
<$> statement of President Wilbur in <?>
endorsing the appeal for funds <$>
<?> which has come to the University. <§>
<£> President Wilbur is serving as a
<?> member of of the National Board <§>
<§> of Trustees of the Relief and has 4>
<$> expressed his interest in the cam
<?> paign in the following message: <§
<?> The Near East Relief represents
<S> one of the noblest one of the <S>
<$> most effective attempts of the <8>
<s> American people to help out the •
<*> people who have gone through the <§>
<§> greatest of trials and misery dur
ing the whole war period. It is
•§> most important that we should do
everything that we can to improve <S>
the conditions in Asia Minor, since '§>
<$> it is the connecting link between
<$> Asia and Europe. If we can see ♦
<§> that justice is done there and that '?■
<§> the orphans and others are fed and '*
<S> clothed it will go a long way to in- <S>
<$> sure the future peace of the world.
Our community has responded ovei '*
and over again to these various ?
<$> appeals. None is more worthy than v
<$> that of the Near East Relief- 1 ®
<$> hope that we can again do our <?>
<§> share. Ray Lyman Wilbur.
