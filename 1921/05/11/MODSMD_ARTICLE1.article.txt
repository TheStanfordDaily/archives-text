# MISTS APPEAR IN INTERESTING MUSIC PROGRAM
## Philharmonic Trio Exhibits Splendid Musicianship in Concert at Little Theatre 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
The Philharmonic trio, composed of
Orley See, violinist, Wenceslao Villal
pando, 'cellist, and William W. Car
ruth, pianist, last evening In the Little
Theatre presented an interestnig pro
gram in a most interesting manner —
the kind of entertainment which makes
the Tuesday Little Theatre series a
worth-while and valuable opportunity.
Mr. See and Mr. Villalpando were
already familiar to campus concert
goers, having appeared at Stanford
with the S. F. Symphony Orchestra in
its concerts here this season, and in
their work last night they maintained
the reputation which they already
held both here and In the bay region,
as musicians of the first rank. The
trio are finished musicians, possessing
thorough artistic skill and full under
standing of their music. Their en
semble work shows perfect ease and
assurance, without at the same time
obscuring the individual instrumental
interest. Their playing is a harmonious
unit, this effect being sustained in
alternate instrumental movements as
well as in the playing of the three
artists as a whole.
The program last evening included
two trio arrangements, each with three
divisional movements, and three violin
solos played by Orley See. The first
number was a trio by Mendelssohn,
consisting in an allegro, an. andante
and a sherzo. The composition is filled
with dramatic suggestion and interest
ing changes of tempo, and was inter
preted with freshness and vigor. The
sherzo in particular was played with
a spontaneity truly delightful. The
second trio, a work by Smetana, was
composed of a moderato movement,
an allego and presto. It afforded op
portunity for brilliant musicianship
and brought out the beauty of the
'cello to advantage.
Orley See's selections were Beet
hoven's "Romance in G Major,"
"Waves at Play," by Orasse, and "Pre
lude and Allegro," by Pugnani-Kreis
ler. In these numbers the violinist
was unfailingly artistic in interpreta
tion, reading his score with sympa
thetic warmth and imagination. His
treatment in the Pugnani-Kreisler
number was dramatic and vividly ac
cented, and hiß appreciation of tonal
beauty was Bhown in tho "Romance."
"Waves at Play," with muted strings,
was a fantastic little composition,
played with dexterity.
Much is to be said in confmendation
of the careful accompaniments played
by William W. Carruth.
