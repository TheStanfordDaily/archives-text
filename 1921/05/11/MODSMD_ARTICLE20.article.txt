# TO LIVE UP TO AN INVITATION
## 
### 
"A congress of buzzards," said Charles K. Field, '95, of the former
Alumni Day of •Commencement Week. The graduates were asked to
return to Stanford when the campus was dead, and they went away
wi'hout having-seen anything of the University they knew as students
or l!:e one of today. Most of the graduates who came back to partici
pate in these dry affairs'tended to grow more indifferent to their Alma
M ater.
The same commencement affair was planned again for the present
year, when there gTew up somewhere among the students the idea that
they themselves should ask the alumni to visit the University as their
guests during the active college year. An alumni committee under C. K.
Field has undertaken to acquaint the graduates with the idea of this new
■Alumni Day and to-indicate the student attitude in asking an opportunity
to show them a regular time on the campus. Many who would .never
have" returned to the old Commencement Week day have been induced
to believe-that there may be real substance behind the students' invitation
to come down as their-guests, and have indicated an intent to be here
next Saturday.
When the several hundred of the livest and most interested grad
uates of the University do return Saturday in response to the invitation
of the students, vy-ill the students be here to take care of them? The act
of being host is one that cannot be delegated to freshmen, nor to a
Imiit'e'd number of individuals. Successful entertainment of the alumni
demands the attention of a majority of the undergraduate Ixxly during
all of Saturday afternoon from 2:30 to (>:3O, when they will be entirely
in the hands of the students,
If students can carry out the spirit of their invitation to the gradu
ates next Saturday there will be many more similar alumni days in the
future, when many of the present students will be able to return for a
good entertainment as guests of that future student body, when they
(we) will be able to get a real grasp of the new personnel, atmosphere,
and activity of that Stanford generation. If the present students fail
Saturday to do the same thing for their guests, the opportunity for such
an Alumni Day is probably lost', the chance to bring graduates in closer
touch and sympathy with the University is lost, Stanford spirit
t'!«at much weakened
