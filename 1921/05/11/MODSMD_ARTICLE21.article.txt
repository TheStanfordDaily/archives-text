# ROUGHING AGAIN
## 
### 
When the smallest fault is found with any institution some injured
advocate must' immediately rise up in great wrath and indignation that
the, most wonderful tradition of what not is being attacked. If ihe
wrong .kind of a tendency is noticed-on the engineering corner, then
some one is attackig the great roughing custom and prefers the race of
tandolined beauties. Presumably, if he found any kind of fault with
'the* Engineering Department, then some member thereof must see in
liim an enemy of the department itself, who undoubtedly wants it abol
ished, and, the member must come to its defense with an eulogy of the
"great clan'of engineering graduates to floor the upstart who is undoubt
edly'suggesting a school of Dennishawn dances in its stead.
The rough who wrote the opinion in last night's Daily had a dif
ferent point of v'revv. and the Daily stretched a point in printing an un
signed communication because it was a good piece of work. Ile took
the opportunity to present a protest against an attitude which he thinks
'♦nay be increasing in some quarters against the roughing tradition. In
may ways he is right, the plain "rough" atmosphere of the former cam
pus is not with iis in the same degree today, and we are with him in
protesting against an attitude which tends to make anything but regular
"roughs" of Stanford students. The Stanford student should cling
tenaciously to and develop every roughing privilege, for when the Cardi
nal campus- bccomCs a home of "properly dressed and correct gentle
kneri, v the true Stanford spirit will have died.
Yet we wonder if every little outgrowth of the roughing tradition is
to be supported in the general enthusiasm for the custom. The rough
last night spoke of one kind of comment about "co-eds" who imitate
Mack Sennett's bathing beauties to attract attention. The Daily on the
• previous evening spoke of another kind. A direct light on the "co-ed"
side of the case was presented by the rough last night. Now can the
tough see the "other side ' of his own case? ,
No reasonable minded student wants to go in any way against the
roughing atmosphere at Stanford, and the Daily will always (we hope)
te the staunches! supporter of all true and reasonable roughing tradi
tions and practices.
