# ESPINOSA TO TRACE SPANISH FOLK SONG FOR RESEARCH CLUB
## 
### 
The Research Club will meet in the
Faculty Clubhouse at 8 o'clock, this
evening. Papers will be read
by Miss Gertrude M. Trace, on "A
Case of Absolute Pitch," and by Pro
fessor A. M. Espinosa, on "Compara
tive Study of a Spanish Folk-Tale."
Professor Espinosa visited Spain re
cently and brought back about forty
folk tales of capital importance. The
one he has chosen to discuss at this
meeting is oriental â€”a Persian folk
tale originally iif fragments, but which
he found in very complete form in
Spain. He will try to trace its exact
source and prove that it was carried
to Spain by the Arabs.
The research Club was organized in
January by a group of the faculty who
were primarily interested in original
investigations. Their purpose was to
unite the various research groups that
have existed separately heretofore.
They meet twice a month and at each
meeting two members submit articles
they have prepared for criticism.
These papers are not finished products,
they are only in the making. In this
way the members of the club get
other's points of view and also have
opportunity to become acquainted with
interesting subjects outside their own
work.
