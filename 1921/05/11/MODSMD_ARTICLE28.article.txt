A review of a recent campus pro
j duction speaks of a certain character

An erstwhile contributor chides us
;as follows: "For shame, Cabbages,
! for the Violent Ink episode. It placed

They tell us that when one of our
; young hopefuls entered a class room
late yesterday and the prof, asked
j why he didn't get there earlier, the
! gent replied that he didn't know the
! bell was going to ring so soon. Do
! they count 'em absent when they come
J back at you that way. If they do,
there ain't no justice.

We noticed that the postman wasn't
struggling under an overload in his
trip to the Daily office this morning.
Them contributions which our propa

ing brain-children no good yet. Suc
cor, for the love o' flapjacks, aid!

See where another family man got
j bumped in a Kansas cyclone. That's

OWN.
