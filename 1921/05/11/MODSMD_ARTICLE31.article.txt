Kimball Young's latest picture,
' Straight From Paris" makes you
think of a lot of things. There are a
number of deft little touches that
call up all sorts of associations and
the philosophy of the thing is rich.
It tells the story of a pretty milliner
(a mere shopkeeper, my deah) and
her rather piquant adventure in getting
herself accepted by the best society.
Some of its mm- 1 novel scene? include
favorite, the interior of the Cabaret
the Chinese boudoir of a Broadway
Royal, and an artistic French Revolu
lution interclude that is reminiscent
of "Passion."
Some of the Quips are Quoted
The sub-titles are the best we have
seen for a long time. Take this, for
instance. "Midnight is a bad time to
argue with a woman —but then, it is
just as good as any other hour."
Again, we have this lucid comment
on the customs of our day. "If them
goings-on had happened on Third
Avenue instead of on Fifth, the place
would have been raided." Nothing
particularly deep about all this but
it helps to keep you interested.
Faith Is the Victory
A couple of seasons back, Channing
Pollock headed his survey of the pro
ductions then current on Broadway
with the title. "The Drama Goes to
Bed." A survey of present-day mofion
pictures might well be titled, "The
Movies Go to Church."
A cynic may remark that he is glad
everybody is going to church, but be
that as it may, what we started out
"to say was that George Melford's pro
duction, "The Faith Healer" is the at
traction down at the Varsity theatre.
Beginning with "The Miracle Man,"
we have had quite a run of pictures
with spiritual themes and this story
of a preacher in the mountains of the
South who was mocked and then saved
by a woman is a good example of its
type. Milton Sills contributes a power
ful piece of acting in the title role.
Marching Through Georgia Again
Someone once said that, the worst
thing about Billy Sunday was that, he
started up so many would-be Billy
Sundays. Mr. John Drink water's ad
mirable play, "Abraham Lincoln," has
had a similar effect and, happily, some
of the other productions inspired by
its success are excellent.
Howard Hall has a playlet which he
calls "A Man of the People," up at
the Orpheum in the city. It presents
a stirring episode in the life of tho
"Great Emancipator," and presents it
with force and dignity. It is history
made human —and interesting.

Clara Sets us Jhinking
Stimulating—that's the word. Clara
Kimball Young's latest picture,
' Straight From Paris" makes you
think of a lot of things. There are a
number of deft little touches that
call up all sorts of associations and
the philosophy of the thing is rich.
It tells the story of a pretty milliner
(a mere shopkeeper, my deah) and
her rather piquant adventure in getting
herself accepted by the best society.
Some of its mm- 1 novel scene? include
favorite, the interior of the Cabaret
the Chinese boudoir of a Broadway
Royal, and an artistic French Revolu
lution interclude that is reminiscent
of "Passion."
Some of the Quips are Quoted
The sub-titles are the best we have
seen for a long time. Take this, for
instance. "Midnight is a bad time to
argue with a woman —but then, it is
just as good as any other hour."
Again, we have this lucid comment
on the customs of our day. "If them
goings-on had happened on Third
Avenue instead of on Fifth, the place
would have been raided." Nothing
particularly deep about all this but
it helps to keep you interested.
Faith Is the Victory
A couple of seasons back, Channing
Pollock headed his survey of the pro
ductions then current on Broadway
with the title. "The Drama Goes to
Bed." A survey of present-day mofion
pictures might well be titled, "The
Movies Go to Church."
A cynic may remark that he is glad
everybody is going to church, but be
that as it may, what we started out
"to say was that George Melford's pro
duction, "The Faith Healer" is the at
traction down at the Varsity theatre.
Beginning with "The Miracle Man,"
we have had quite a run of pictures
with spiritual themes and this story
of a preacher in the mountains of the
South who was mocked and then saved
by a woman is a good example of its
type. Milton Sills contributes a power
ful piece of acting in the title role.
Marching Through Georgia Again
Someone once said that, the worst
thing about Billy Sunday was that, he
started up so many would-be Billy
Sundays. Mr. John Drink water's ad
mirable play, "Abraham Lincoln," has
had a similar effect and, happily, some
of the other productions inspired by
its success are excellent.
Howard Hall has a playlet which he
calls "A Man of the People," up at
the Orpheum in the city. It presents
a stirring episode in the life of tho
"Great Emancipator," and presents it
with force and dignity. It is history
made human —and interesting.
