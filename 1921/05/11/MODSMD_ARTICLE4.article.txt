# "COLLEGE CABARET" WILL PROVIDE ENTERTAINMENT FOR HOMECOMING ALUMNI
## 
### 
Ending the festivities of Alumni Day
next Saturday, a campua dance will
be staged in the Women's Clubhouse.
Though designed as the finale for the
reunion the hop will be in the nature
of a general campus dance to which
all undergraduates will be invited.
A closed date has been granted for
the evening to the Alumni Committee.
As the alumni dinner at Roble will
not break up until late in the even
ing, the dance will largely be a stu
dent affair. Jack Heffernan's synco
paters have been engaged for the
evening and promise to furnish jazz
lately introduced from Broadway. A
nominal charge, probably a dollar, will
be made for the dance which begins
at 9:00 o'clock.
An experiment in alumni banquets
will be tried Saturday evening. The
glory of departed days and the follies
of the present will not form thg basis
for long-winded dissertations under
the plan of the committee in charge.
Speaking will occupy a minor role in

the program and will con£ist of but a
few impromptu talks.
A college cabaret is the daring title
given to the entertainment of the
evening. A number of dancers will
dance between the tables during the
course of the dinner and later will
present a short program. Les Seib
and Jack Heffernan are scheduled for
specialty stunts. Several popular
lyrics of the "Maid to Order" have
been selected for presentation, Sat
urday evening, a number of the cast
consenting to reproduce the hits of
the opera.
Judging from the large number of
alumni reservations daily received by
J. E. McDowell, the banquet seats will
be filled solely by graduates. The ac
commodations of Roble will be ex
tnded to the limit to caro for the num
ber expected. Not until the last
alumni reservations are received the
latter part of the week can the num
ber of extra seats, if any, be determ
ined.
