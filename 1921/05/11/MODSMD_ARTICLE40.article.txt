# Hope of Destitute Lies in Children, Says C. V. Vickrey

The hope of the future for the Near
East countries lies in the orphan chil
dren now being cared for by America
through the Near East Relief, according
to Charles V. Vickrey, general secretary
of the Relief.
The present plight of the Near East
is the result of the part played in the
war when the small Armenian-Assyrian
army in Asia Minor threw itself across
the path of the Turks, who under Ger
man tutelage were advancing from the
Black to the Caspian Sea and thus saved
Asia to the Allies. The country has not
yet been able to recover from the devas
tation resulting from the invasion of the
Turkish armies and is forced to look
for outside aid until a stable govern
ment is effected.. Vickrey, who made a
tour of the devastated districts during
September, expresses the value of Amer
ica's aid and its bearing on the future of
the stricken countries in a cable sent at
that time:
"The prime minister, president, the
governors, mayors of cities and all au
thorities agree that Armenia was saved
last year by flour and other foodstuffs
sent from America- They are not only
devoutly grateful, but they are thrifty,
hard-working and industrious, and con
sidering their handicaps have made re
markable progress toward self-support.
Hundreds of thousands of the popula
tion are still refugees from the Turkish
Armenia, without homes or property
rights. Without modern agricultural
implements, with an insufficient number
of oxen and an inadequate supply of
seed wheat, they have nevertheless suc
ceeded in raising food supplies that will
carry them until midwinter. After that
time supplementary supplies must be
provided until the recently signed peace
treaty with Turkey can be made effective
and security given by which these exiled
Armenians can return to the site of
their ruined homes and regain full self
support.
"These orphaned boys and girls con
stitute the hope of the future for the
Near East. American philanthropy is
rendering through the Near East Relief
an inestimable service in promoting good
will and international friendship. A few
million dollars today in the form of food,
education and industrial training for
these orphans may save billions of dol
lars tomorfow in warfare and interna
tional strife.' *
