The presentation of two famous
French comedies and a musical pro

tonight, in the Little Theater.
The dramatic part of the entertain

(Night-Lodging) and "Le Pharmacien"
(The Druggist), two short plays by
Max Maurey, director of Le Grand
Guignol in Paris for several years.
The comedies of his which will be
given tonight abound in funny situa
tions and witty dialogue.
Paul Herkman in "L'Asile de Nuit"
will essay a role of a common tramp
who meets with bewildering experi
ences in a municipal lodging house.
Rimo Bacigalupi, as the director of
the lodging house, and John Faulds,
the "trusty," who works each day
for a bowl of soup, complete the skit.
In the second play, "Le Pharmaci
en," Raoul May takes the title role
of the blustering druggist who knows
little disposition at first to treat any
one kindly. Madeleine Lechten and
Julien Raick fit exactly the require
ments of their respective roles of the
little girl and the friendly lawyer. The
part of Rond, the tardy clerk who In
curs the special ire of the druggist,
will be played by Alexander Briggs,
and Ivan Messenger will be seen as
the gendarme.
