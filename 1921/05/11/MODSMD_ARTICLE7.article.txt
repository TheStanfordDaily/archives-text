Young pitched as good a game for
the Row representatives as did Purdy
for El Cuadro, which was a slick one.
Just after Young's arm tired and he
was removed, Sigma Chi rallied for
two counts and a tied score. Rasmus
sen made third and was sent home by

caught going home after Baker's hit.

Baker's was one of the three he scored
during the course of the game.
Cleavland then took the box against
the El Cuadro and promptly left after
Eggleston's homer and a single. Baker
then took the rubber and after one
clean hit and a couple of errors which
coupled with a few bean-balls left El
Cuadro with five more runs to the
good before he could oust them.
Haley, the demon southpaw of the
Theta Delta Chi held what few good
batsman the Chi Psis had to very
few hits. The high lights of the game
were the homers of Lilly and Harper.
The final count showed the Theta
