# SENIORS WILL HOLD BALL AT WILBUR'S HOME
## Annual Affair Will Combine Banquet and Dance; Ticket Sale is Limited to 100 
### 
Friday night, June 17. the Seniors
will finish their week of festivities with
the annual ball. This year the ball will
be held on the campus in "the President's
mansion and will be in the nature of a
dinner dance. The exact time for the
staxt of the supper is not set definitely
as yet, but will be somewhere near 7
o'clock. The mansion will be given
over in entirety in the south wing to
the party and the dance will last until
a later hour than is the custom.
None others than Seniors and Hold
overs will be admitted to the banquet
and ball unless the limited number of
tickets are not disposed of. It is ex
pected that there will be no trouble in
getting rid of the 100 that will be placed
on sale for reservations. The very
limited number is due to the size of
the accommodations that can be obtained
on the campus, and also because the
committee wishes to make the banquet
that precedes the ball a regular course
meal. The seating accommodations that
can be paired preclude the possibility
of making the number of admissions
any larger. The hundred has been set
as an absolute figure and it is announced
that there will be no exceptions made in
adding new tickets. Ample time will
be given to reserve tickets when, they
are put on sale.
At the banquet there will be individual
favors for men and women, and dancing
with the meal. The cost of the entire
entertainment will be $11 per couple.
There will be no single plate charges.
Edna Harrison and Katharine Morri
son have been appointed as additional
members to serve on the committee for
the ball.
