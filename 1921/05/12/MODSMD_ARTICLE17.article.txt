# A 						PURPOSE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Answers received from invitations sent out to graduates of Stan
ford.to visit the campus as guests of the students indicate a great flood
of old-timers next Saturday so many, in fact, that our local graduates
may be forced to give up their reservations at the President's luncheon
and the evening banquet to provide for the alumni who are coming
from a distance. This response has a definite meaning: The graduates
have taken seriously the offer of the present undergraduate body to ac
quaint them in (rue student fashion with the live Stanford campus of the
present. The alumni day of former years never met with a beginning
of the reaction that the alumni have already shown to the students' pro
posal of Saturday
Since (lie former students are to be here in numbers, the individual
attention of most of the present students is necessary to entertain them
as we have promised to do. To make the day a success a majority of the
members of the .student body will have to refrain from making engage-
Merits for Kriday afternoon between 2:30 and 6:30 and give their time to
welcoming 1 the older generations of Stanford men and women.
A university is a compact organization of students, faculty, and
aftimnl. A close co-operation of all three is necessary to university suc
cess. Wherever possible the lines of distinction between these elements
must l>e eliminated, for all have a common purpose. The alumni must
be made to feel this, to feel that the students look a great deal to tlu-m
for the molding and building of a future Stanford.
