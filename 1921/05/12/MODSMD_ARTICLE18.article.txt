# WITHOUT A SALARY

' There arc teachers and teachers. Some appear kind and seemingly
human, others are indifferent and uninterested, and still others hold
classes overtime and give quizzes after vacations. But, somewhere, there
is a common pedagogical trait that is one of the finest qualities in the
world—the quality of loyalty and service.
"Not long ago the legislature of Oklahoma adjourned without appro
priating funds for the maintenance of tin* state university for the rest of
the year. It looked as if the university would have to close and the work
of the semester he left uncompleted. Then the faculty passed a unani
mous resolution to stay by the school for the rest of the year, although
there was no prospect of salaries. Though it will be a sacrifice for many
members to remain under these conditions, they are all loyal.
'It is nearly impossible to imagine a group of workers in any
other occupation who would even consider working two months without
|>ay, and the workers in few fields have the vision of service that the
teachers have which makes them loyal even to the extent of personal
sacrifice."; —Daily Kansan. ,
We might add that there were times in the early history of Stanford
when members of Dr. Jordan's faculty received salary remuneations at
very long intervals, and found it necessary to carry accounts with Palo
Alto grocers from month to month, and year to year. Vet they stayed
cu and gave the best they had, and the brilliant young Stanford faculty
became kno'wn throughout the nation.
