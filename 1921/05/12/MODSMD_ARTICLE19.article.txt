Editor Daily Palo Alto:—When the
atumui congregate on the campus
again on the coming Saturday, there
will probably he among them some
who have neither frieuds nor relatives
among the present student body; and
4n the student body there are a great
pmny who would be glad to assist in
tho entertainment of the returning
grads, but who are not acquainted
with any of them.
fn tho spirit vyhich the editorial in
(he D. P. A of yesterday prompts,
and with an interest in making
Alumni Day one of the important oc
casions of the year when the alumui

may return to the campus and llnd a
hearty welcome by the student body,
may I suggest that an announcement
of the plan by which the students who
have no relatives or friends to enter
tain may meet the alumni who have
not friends among the student body
would materially assist in making
Alumni Day a greater success.
Yours truly,
CLYDE B. GUNTER, '22.
(Editor's Note: —It is the intention
of the committee under Melvin E.
Doyle, '21, to announce tomorrow the
complete program between 2:30 and
6:30 in which students wrll entertain
the visitors, and to indicate just HOW
they may do it.)
