## Declares Bolshevism Stirring Up Far East by Malicious Propaganda Against Whites 
### 
Characterizing Bolshevism as a sort of
substitute for Judaism, Tully C.
Knowles, president of the College of the
Pa<*ific, said, last night, "On the downfall
of Kerensky, Trotzsky and other radical
Jews saw the opportunity for a revived
internationalism that would touch every
state in Europe and America, and even
tually, in Asia. As a result, the Third
Internationale was called in March.
1919."
Only the most ultra-radical socialists
were invited to attend the Moscow con
vention as delegates. Victor Berger, the
notorious A.merican pacifist and slacker,
applied for membership, but the council
wrote back: "In the Third Interna
tionale, we have no place for such 100
per cent Americans." Only four so
cialist parties in the United States out
of the existing sixteen or eighteen
groups were given credentials to sit in
the convention. At the first meeting,
they adopted the resolution, "This is not
a democracy and does not aim toward
a democracy but toward the dictator
ship of the proletariat."
He pointed out the vitality of the
Third Internationale by showing that
Bolshevism has continued to live de
spite the opposition of surrounding na
tions and of the Allied armies and has
even spread into Finland, Sweden, Aus
tria and Italy. One of the most promis
ing fields for its malicious propaganda
has been the Orient—Afghanistan. Egypt,
India, and other countries in the Far
East. Here they have systematically
stirred tip unrest by appeals such as this:
"Workers of Asia, you have an oppor
tunity that the workers of America do
not have. They have been forced to
pass through a capitalist age, but you
can obviate that necessity by the imme
diate overthrow of the feudalist system,
by overthrowing the 'white dominion,'
and driving out the western exploiters
and seizing, yourselves, the control of
the sources of supply and the industries
for your own profit."
