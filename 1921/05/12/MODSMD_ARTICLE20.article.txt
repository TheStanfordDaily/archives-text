# Professor Bassett Advocates New Type of Public Speaking
## 
### 
Lee Emerson Bassett, Professor of
English, and one of the foremost teach
ers of public speaking ip this country,
believes in the power of speech, but not
in too much speaking. "There are
times," he says, "when I feel like desig
nating my classes as courses in public
silence rather than in public speech.
When we have less speaking and more
thought, we shall have better public
speakers."
Professor Bassett holds the view that
a mind prepared and a definite, sincere
purpose are necessary in speaking and
in reading aloud. It is better for a man
to speak crudely what he knows and
honestly believes than to exploit a rich
vocabulary in eloquent voice without
definiteness and clearness of thought and
sincerity of purpose.
This idea of the relation of clear
thinking and sincere feeling on one
hand, and effective speaking on the
other, lies back of all the instruction
given in oral expression and public
speaking at Stanford. Under the guid
anee of Professor Bassett this part of
tlie English department has developed
greatly in the last few years. It is his
belief that public speaking, when prop
erly handled, has an important place
among other university subjects.
Professor Bassett has had extensive
preparation in this field, having been in
terested in it from his youth. He was
born in the town of Salem, Wisconsin,
in 1872. Upon graduation from the sec
ondary schools, lie entered Lawrence
University, at Appleton, Wisconsin, in
1896, and a year later became a student
at the Cumnock School of Expression in
Los Angeles. In 1900 and 1901 Profes
sor Bassett attended the well-known
Curry School of Expression in Boston
and studied under Dr. S. S. Curry, to
whom he owes much inspiration and ex
cellent instruction.
He returned to California and re
ceived his A. B. degree from the English
department at Stanford in 1901, al
though lie had already served as instruc

tor in public speaking at the University
of Southern California in 1898 and 1899.
Professor Bassett has been closely con
nected with the affairs of Stanford ever
since his graduation, with the exception
of the years of 1912 and 1913. when he
was on the University of Washington
faculty. Immediately afVr his gradua
tion he was appointed instructor in the
English department here, and was raised
to the rank of assistant professor four
years later- In 1913 he became an asso
ciate professor and in 1919 the rank of
professor was conferred upon him.
In 1907 and 1908, Professor Bassett,
on a year's leave of absence from Stan
ford, went to Europe and studied at
Oxford, England, for a year. There he
took work in phonetics under Professor
Sweet, the distinguished English pho
netician, hearing the general lectures and
receiving private instruction.
Phi Beta Kappa, the American Asso
ciation of University Professors, and
the Association of Academic Teachers
of Public Speaking claim him as a mem
ber. He is the author of a "Hand-book
of Oral Reading," published in 1916,
which is used extensively throughout the
country.
Professor Bassett, as chairman of the
Committee on Public Exercises, occupies
a position which carries with it a great
amount of work and responsibility.
There is scarcely an event of any public
character that takes place on the campus
that has not been arranged for by this
committee.
Professor Bassett is widely known as
an accomplished reader and speaker, and
has appeared in practically all the towns
of any size in California. Until recently
he took extensive trips throughout the
state, delivering commencement ad
dresses, giving readings, and also lec
tures on various subjects. Now, how
ever, he finds his time more than taken
up with the'work in oral expression and
public speaking here and with his duties
as chairman of the. Committee on Public
Exercises.
