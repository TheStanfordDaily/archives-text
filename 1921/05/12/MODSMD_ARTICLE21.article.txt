We suggest a remedy for the over
steppers on the Engineering Corner,
smoked glasses and stiff necks for
I "those who overstep traditional priv
ileges" and wool stockings and over
coats for "those who over-step the
boundary of modesty and common
I sense."

War-horse Wallie declares that the
! recipients of the "repulsive ogling"
; should sneak past under camouflage.
Says they ought to creep around the
Quad behind a freshly plucked bush
to keep from "getting the rough
blamed."

Such a suggestion makes uh think
that the full-dress leaf may come in
vogue again in out ulta-moderji day.

The Press Gang battery was out
warming up today. Said the rest of
the team comprised the assault. They

While interest in intramural ath
letics is rife, we ought to hold a con
test on the Engineering Corner for

To that old saying, "Finders, keep
ers; losers, weepers," we would add,
for the benefit of the finders, "Keep
you peepers peeled for sleepers." For
example, grab off the extra chip if
there's too many antes.

Lemm Onn says the tightest guy in
the world is the bird who liveijj next
door to a church and makes a board
side-walk to get the kids' pennies who
go by. He's wrong. It's the ham
who saves coal dust for Ethiopian
face powder.

GOOD CAUSE FOR BURNING
The boy stood on the burning deck,
So sang the ancient bards,
They didn't say—but we suspect
Somebody stacked the cards.

Behold, Nestoria scorns tradition
and offers 25 rocks to the wise one
who dispels the "illusion." Whence
comes that 24 straight? The Nestoria
committee of research, after "diligent
ly scrutinizing the files of the Daily
since the founding of the University"
found no trace of a debate before 1915.
Let us compute the involved data.
24 years times 9 months times fifteen
issues to the month (very conserva
tive) time:; 2 minutes to the issue,
divided by 60 to make hours, makes
15 eight-hour days. The committee
must have been pretty busy.
It. is rumored that Euphronia is con
ducting a scientific investigation and
research in an effort to trap the 25
beans while the offer holds good. It'll
help pay the annual banquet expenses.
We refer them to the "Old Guard"
for information leading to the avve.it i
and corvfction of this evidence.
