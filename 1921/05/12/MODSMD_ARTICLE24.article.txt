## 
### 
An evenly contested match is pre
dicted in the polo game to be staged for
the benefit of the alumni Saturday after
noon between the Reds and the Whites,
rival squads on the campus.
For the Reds, Major Collins stands out
as the best player, with a handicap of
three. He is easily the best polo player
on the campus, and the hopes of the ver
milion squad are centered in him. On
the White team, C. L Cecil and P. H.
Talbert, each with a handicap of three,
are the men to be reckoned with. In
a practice game held yesterday they
proved themselves fast and able to stick
close to their men.
The polo field is being clipped and
sprinkled for the big game with San
Mateo a week from Saturday. In this
contest the Cardinal team will run up
against polo players of national reputa
tion. This game will close the polo sea
son for the spring, as the grounds are
becoming hard, and the horses are to be
sent to pasture to recuperate from the
strenuous months of play.
