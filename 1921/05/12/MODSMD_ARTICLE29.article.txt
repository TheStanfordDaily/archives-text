## 
### 
Alpha Tau Omega's nine captured the
long end of a 6-to-l score in a hot six
round contest with Beta Theta Pi yes
terday. The game was a good exhi
bition of the national pastime, there be
ing few errors committed by the infield
ers and none by the keepers of the outer
gardens. Sutton, on the mound for the
winners, allowed only three hits, and is
credited with eight strikeouts. Reed, op
posing hurler, tightened up after the tirst
inning and pitched steady ball, gaining
five strikeouts. T. Merfz, first batter for
Beta Theta Pi, drew a walk and crossed
the home platter on a hit by Reed, scor
ing his team's only tally. The Alpha
Tau stickers toed the plate with a
vengeance in the same period. Taylor,
Sutton, and Moir connected for singles-
Esgen. batting next, caught Reed's de
livery squarely and cleaned the bases
with a home-run trip. Two more runs
were annexed by the victors before the
final inning. Moir, A. T. (). captain, has
built up one of the top intramural teams
during the last few weeks.
No other scheduled games were played
yesterday. Phi Delta Theta, Theta
Delta Chi, Alpha Delta Phi, and Break
ers won by forfeit. Phi Delta Theta and
Alpha Delta Phi played a practice con
test in which the latter came out ahead
6 to 4.
An informal baseball battle was won
by Delta Kappn Epsilon against Phi Psi
on the varsity diamond. Six varsity and
several freshman players participated,
giving the game a decidedly top-notch
atmosphere. Cieorge Green heaved for
the victors and held the opposition to
three runs. Bundy was on the receiving
end. Richmond .and his Phi Psi team
mates kept a two-run lead until the fifth
frame. The D. K. E. sluggers swung a
fast willow in the fifth and circled the
bags seven times, thereby putting the
game on ice. The same contingent netted
two more tallies in the next period.
