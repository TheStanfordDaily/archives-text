, %
The committee on the 1924 sophomore
hat has two different and distinct de
signs for presentation to the freshman
class at the next meeting. The head
gears are not like either the old Cardinal
cap or the '23 tweed. The cap is of red
material and in one model has white
buttons on either side of the visor,
which in the other are reinforced by a
white band around the back. The hat
is of good quality, white felt, with a
medium brim, slightly rolled, and has a
narrow cardinal ribbon attached.
The purpose of the designs is to get
some combination which will be distinc-'
tive, which everyone will wear, and
which won't be razzed for gaudiness, as
previous attempts to find a distinctive
hat Tor sophomores have been. Solid
ness of colors is the vehicle by which
this is to be attained. That the promi
nence of otie color has been used to set
off the well placed portions of others,
was the statement of one of the commit
teemen today.
