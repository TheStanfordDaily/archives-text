# FRENCH CLUB GIVES ANNUAL BENEFIT PLAY
## Plays Presented by Members of French Club a Success; Music Numbers Also Please 
### G. H. Elmore, '23 
The two short plays, "L'Asile de Nuit"
and "Le Pharmacien," presented by the
Cercle Francais last night as part of
their annual benefit entertainment,
amused and interested an audience that
filled the Little Thaeter. Aside from the
presentation in French, their appeal lay
in witty dialogue and keen insight into
human nature, rather than in elaborate
plot.
On account of its vigorous action and
changing situations, "Le Pharmacien"
seemed to win the greater favor with the
audience, and this was due in part to
the work of Raoul May in the title role.
May's interpretation brought out ef
fectively the varying moods through
wheib the druggist, wh<J had apparently
made a fatal mistake in a prescription,
passed. He put the part over with his
distinct delivery and forceful acting.
Julien Raick not only looked the part of
M. Legrin, the lawyer, but also carried
it off well otherwise. The characteriza
tion of the clerk by Alexander Briggs
was marked by good acting, while Made
leine Lechten and Ivan Messenger, as
the little girl and the gendarme, respec
tively, produced various complications
in tfie action.
The movements and expression of
Paul Herkman as the self-possessed
tramp in unfamiliar and bewildering cir
cumstances featured "L'Asile de Nuit."
Herkman made the most of his clSOacter
part, and his characterization lifted the
comedy from the class of a conuimn
plaee, short skit. Rimo Racigalupi,
playing le directeur. who lavishes all
the unexpected attention upon Haps, the
tramp, got his part over bv his forceful
speaking.
The musical part of the entertainment
consisted of a group of French songs
combined so as to form a sort of skit or
prologue. Anna Ramsey, in her song,
"Jeuws Fillettes," showed a voice of fine
quality and volume. The pantomime,
"Au Clair de la Lune," presented by
Miss Ramsey as Pierrette, and Isabelle
Townley. as Pierot, aided by the chorus,
closed this part of the program.
The scene# recently acquired by the
Cercle Francais was used for the first
time last night, and added greatly to the
effect. Its use brought out the possi
bilities of the Little Theater as a palce
for the production of short plays.
