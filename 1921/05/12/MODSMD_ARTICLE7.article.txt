"Supplemental feeding is imperative
in desolated countries," said Professor
H. R. Fairclough in speaking of the
work of the Near East Relief in Asia
Minor. "It saved thousands of lives in
Montenegro and did much toward aiding
that country to a financial standing
which no wenables it to pay for the
food for its poor."
Professor Fairclough, who served for
two years as commissioner of the Amer
ican Red Cross in Montenegro, sees a
striking parallel between the conditions
in that district an dthose in the Near
East countries from which an appeal
for funds has come. "The Montenegrin
officials declared that our work was
vital and meant the salvation of the
country," said Professor Fairclough.
"The Jugo-Slav government at Belgrade
is now following up the plans set by the
Red Cross in Montenegro and its other
subject territories according to Ameri
can directions. The work included hos
pitals, orphanages, and systematic child
feeding.
"The conditions of the people were
frightful when ou rworkers took up their
duties'there. They were starving, with
out shelter and with only scanty cloth
ing. Typhus and diseases of every kind
were raging, but by giving food and
clothing and medical aid many lives
were saved, and when we left the coun
try the government was able to take over
and continue a work which they saw
was absolutely essential for the people.

"Affairs in the Near East countries,
to my knowledge, are today very similar
to the conditions which I found on my
arrival in Montenegro," continuer Pro
fessor Fairclough. "The Near East Re
lief is endeavoring to care for the des
titute in Armenia until a stable govern
ment can take over the responsibility
and with our support the work there
should be successful." â€”
A first-hand account of the suffering
of the children in and about Constanti
nople. a district in which the Near East
Relief is operating, is given in a letter
receved recently from John P. Gregg,
who is connected with the American
Relief administration in London. Gregg,
who served with the American militar
attache in Belgrade with the rank of
captain during the war, had intimate re
lations with Professor Fairclough, and
recently visited Montenegro on his way
to the East. In his letter he describes
the pitiful condition of the children
around Constantinople, a condition
which he declares to be even worse in
the smaller villages. He mentions in
particular the plight of the thousands of
starving refugees stranded at Salonika
in Thrace. They are without any means
of existence and the child mortality is
exceedingly high.
Gregg emphasizes the deep apprecia
tion of the suffering people for the help
which the United States has given. "The
work of the Red Cross and the aid of
America willy never be forgotten," he
writes.
