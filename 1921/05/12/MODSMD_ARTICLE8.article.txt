# LARGE NUMBER OF ALUMNI WILL RETURN TO CAMPUS
## Roble Will Be Scene of Banquet; Dance at Club House to Follow 
### 
The enthusiasm with which the in
vitation to Stanford's alumni to return
to the campus on Alumni Day, next
Saturday, has been received throughout
the state bids fair to tax the capacity of
the Roble Hall dining rooms, which will
be the scene of the big University ban
quet on this occasion. Roble dining
room, which affords the largest seating
capacity for a banquet on the campus,
will 'not care for more than 225, and al
ready nearly 200 acceptances have been
received from former Stanford students,
thus forcing the local alumni to limit
their numbers at the festivities.
There was some hope that a limited
number of students would be afforded

an opportunity to attend this dinner, but
their chances have practically vanished
with the unexpected demand for scats.
For the benefit of these students the
dance, which planned to follow the
banquet, will be begun before the con
clusion of the dinner program, the din
ner guests taking in that part of the
program later.
The student body is being organized
into a universal reception committee to
taki; care of the visiting grads during
the afternoon. At 2:30 the grand gathet
ing of alumni, students and faculty will
take place in the Memorial Court. From
there the students will escort the old
timers over the athletic fields, where a
varied carnival of athletic activities has
[been arranged. One of the most inter
esting features tfrold-ftme Stanford stu
dents will be the polo game between
the two campus teams, the Reds and the
Whites. The Stanford polo players have
become expert enough to be able to
compete 011 fairly even terms with such
a notable organization as the team of the
San Mateo Country Club.
In addition, exhibition matches* will
be played by the Stanford tennis team.
A sample of the swimming and diving
which has enabled Stanford to produce
the best swimmers and divers of any of
the coast colleges will be given when the
water polo game and inter-fraternity
aquatic contest is staged in the Encina
pool.
The afternoon of sightseeing and
sports will he concluded by a half hour
of music in the Memorial Church, at
which Warren D .Allen and the Stan
ford Glee Club will render several num
bers.
The serious part of the program will
be contained in the inspection of the
campus under the guidance of President
Wilbur, following a luncheon at the
President's house. Points of interest
will include the new Union, the proposed
football stadium's site, and development
of the other athletic fields.

Lutz, of the Hoover War Collection, are

scope and value of the collection.

quet on this occasion. Roble dining
room, which affords the largest seating
capacity for a banquet on the campus,
will 'not care for more than 225, and al
ready nearly 200 acceptances have been
received from former Stanford students,
thus forcing the local alumni to limit
their numbers at the festivities.
There was some hope that a limited
number of students would be afforded

an opportunity to attend this dinner, but
their chances have practically vanished
with the unexpected demand for scats.
For the benefit of these students the
dance, which planned to follow the
banquet, will be begun before the con
clusion of the dinner program, the din
ner guests taking in that part of the
program later.
The student body is being organized
into a universal reception committee to
taki; care of the visiting grads during
the afternoon. At 2:30 the grand gathet
ing of alumni, students and faculty will
take place in the Memorial Court. From
there the students will escort the old
timers over the athletic fields, where a
varied carnival of athletic activities has
[been arranged. One of the most inter
esting features tfrold-ftme Stanford stu
dents will be the polo game between
the two campus teams, the Reds and the
Whites. The Stanford polo players have
become expert enough to be able to
compete 011 fairly even terms with such
a notable organization as the team of the
San Mateo Country Club.
In addition, exhibition matches* will
be played by the Stanford tennis team.
A sample of the swimming and diving
which has enabled Stanford to produce
the best swimmers and divers of any of
the coast colleges will be given when the
water polo game and inter-fraternity
aquatic contest is staged in the Encina
pool.
The afternoon of sightseeing and
sports will he concluded by a half hour
of music in the Memorial Church, at
which Warren D .Allen and the Stan
ford Glee Club will render several num
bers.
The serious part of the program will
be contained in the inspection of the
campus under the guidance of President
Wilbur, following a luncheon at the
President's house. Points of interest
will include the new Union, the proposed
football stadium's site, and development
of the other athletic fields.
Directors E. I). Adams and R. W.
Lutz, of the Hoover War Collection, are
preparing an exhibit to indicate the
scope and value of the collection.
