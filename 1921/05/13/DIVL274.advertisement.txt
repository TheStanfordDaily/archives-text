picture, and I'm having one of mine framed to send home to the adoring and devoted family. ®
They take such care with the work they do and it's such a satisfaction to feel you can trust j*
'em to do the kind of things the way you want 'em. ' S

water-waves are just wavy enough to look like a soft marcel—without wrecking one's tresses W
in the least—truly! She has such very necessary conveniences as hair nets and hairpins of

a relief—know I'll be able to study six times as well. Moreover—he has the most fascinating iftj
