# DRAPER TO HURL AGAINST RATNER ALL-STARS HERE
## Ex-Card Recruits Team From Golden Gate Park to Play Seay's "Red" Aggregation 
### 
Some snappy baseball will doubtless
be dißhed out on the local lot, tomor
row afternoon, when Coach Seay's
baseballers mix with an aggregation
from San Francisco headed 'by Ezra
Ratner who played keystone hassock
on Coach "Bob" Evans' 1920 varsity.
Ratner has recruited his team from
the bay city lots, principally from the
Golden Gate Park, where the famous
Park Bums hold forth on each and
every Saturday afternoon and put out
some of the best baseball to be seen
in the state.
The Park Bums are known as some
of the cleverest horsehide handlers
to be found out of fast company. They
get together every Saturday afternoon
and Sunday morning usually for a side
bet of one buck apiece, choose sides
kid fashion, toss up for first licks and
then play baseball aB if the champion
ship of the world were at stake.
Ratner, who, by the way, holds the
long distance falling record for the
Santa Clara field, he having started
falling at the home plate and finished
in a startling nose dive between sec
ond and third base, on what should
have been a circuit clout, in the sec
ond game with the Mission College
last season, will wear the wind pad.
Gay Reppy who has had several flings
in fast company will concoct the
mystifiers.
Guy Draper will, again v take the
mound for Stanford after a lay-off of
two weeks. Draper has been hit hard
by the warm spring weather of this
week, and is bound and determined to
show the Ratner All Stars some real
high-class heaving. Captain Bundy
will go behind the log to receive the
slants of Draper. With this battery
combination working as it did in the
Federal Reserve Bank game, when
Draper was put in during the sixth
frame and struck out seven batters
in a row, the Park Bums are going to
wish they were up where the salt soa
breezes blow.
The two teams will go to bat in the
following order: Ratner All-Stars
Burns, 3b; Conlin, If; Jones, ss;
Stalker, cf; Rose, rf; Swan, lb; Gar
rigan, 2b; Ratner, c; Toutz, Fisher,
Reppy, p.
Stanford—Mitchell, 2b; Kallam, ss;
Green, rf; Kline, 2b; Carver, If; Pat
