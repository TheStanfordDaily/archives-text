# WHAT TO DO

### 
Just how to aid in showing the alumni of Stanford a good time on
the Farm tomorrow is the question being considered by every student
who has the true interest of the University in mind. The graduates are
returning to the campus in numbers for the new Student's Alumni Day.
They are frorp localities near the bay district as well as from points be
yond Los Angeles and Portland. The ability of the student body to
make good on its end of the new reunion which it has started depends
on the active aid of its every member, and the query we have heard more
than any other is just how each student may best act his part during the
hours when lie is host.
The graduates will be entertained at luncheon at the President's
home. At 2:30 p. m. they will come to the Memorial Court, where they
first meet the students, and where the students take them as guests. At
llic Court the San ford, band will play a number or two, and the former
students will be formally welcomed by the undergraduate body. A sue
cessful beginning of the students' program demands the presence of the
student body en masse.
During the period at the Memorial Court, the students, since they
are hosts, are expected to take the initiative and make themselves known
to the alumni with whom they can come in touch. No other common
bond or affiliation than Stanford fellowship and Stanford spirit is
needed. Let there be no returning graduate who does not meet at least
five or ten students at the Memorial Court. When the numbers of the
band are concluded students are expected to take the alumni in small
groups or individually, or however they may have attached themselves,
from the court to the athletic events on the program announced.
The exhibition matches will take up the afternoon until 5:00 p.m.,
when the guests should be conducted to the Memorial Church to hear
a short program by Mr. Allen and the Glee Club, which will end at 5 :30.
At this time every student should extend as rnanv invitations as possible
to as many alumni as possible to spend the rest hour between 5:30 and
6:30 at the respective students house or home. Kverv individual host
will make a bid for every guest he may, and allow the guest the priv
ilege of selecting the house or hall where he would like most to spend
the hour. At 6:30 the rest hour concludes and the opportunity to enter
tain the visitors informally ends, and the visitors must he sent or taken
to Koble, where the great banquet under Charles K. Field is to be held.
The success of the banquet* with a* student cabaret and an excellent toast
master, is guaranteed.
The idea to be kept in mind by every student is that he or she is
individually host during the hours mentioned and must put himself or
herself forward, or "bust right up," as some one has said, to the-grad
uates. kvery Mr. and Mrs. Alumnus who answer the invitation and
present themselves at the Memorial Court tomorrow should find a group
of six or eight undergraduates clamoring during the entire afternoon for
the privilege of entertaining them and conducting them to the various
events or other points to which they might wish to go, until 6:30, when
our honor as personal hosts will end.
