# TO OUR VISITORS

The Daily Palo Alto wishes to extend to you, former Stanford
students, an undergraduate welcome to the farm and to your old campus
home. The present students have been glad to ask you as their partic-'
filar guests to return to the University, and are pleased that you have
responded so heartily.
We have a program which we hope you will enjoy, and we ask the
privilege of entertaining you at the exhibitions; or wherever else you
may like best to go. May your short return to the scene of your under
graduate days be a pleasant one, and may you, we hope, leave it again
with just a little renewed confidence in your alma mater; and with a'
realization that as students we now look to you, more than ever, as a
vital part of' the University. And may you know that we expect in the
future to combine with you as fellow alumni in helping to make of
Stanford ail that it can and should be in the world..
