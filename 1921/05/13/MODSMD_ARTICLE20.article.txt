We were advised the other day to
look over the Faculty Equitation Class
(note capital letters) to get a few
good ideas for this column. After
peering from an Encina window for a
few minutes, we decided to devote a
full column to the subject.
» * •
On second thought we've decided to
wait until end-quarter exes are over.
* * •
Just getting over the effects of the
Daily banquet last night. Couldn't
get the combination to the salad.
•
According to the best information
(D.P.A.) the next soph bonnet is to
bo one "which won't be razzed for
gaud in ess of color." "It is of red ma
terial and in one model has white
buttons on either side of the visor,
which in the other are reinforced by
a white band around the back."
* * *
'24 must intend >to set up an ear
trumpet agency as a means to clear
up its $1200 debt. Just to show there's
no race prejudice, they ought to em
ploy a cotbred band instead of a
white one.
* • •
On the calendar of a few is the first
annual baseball light between the
Daily staff and the U. P. (not union
prices). The U. P. is a wild bunch.
They've been throwing 'em wilder in
practice every day. Nobody except
the ex-pug water carrier, who has the
rheumatiz, can hit the broad side of
a brewery with a handful of buckshot.
• • •
A saving restaurant proprietor near
the campus never washes the knives.
Says he does that so he won't have
to provide butter. Perhaps the same
saving applies to table cloths. He \
don't have to furnish a bill of fare.
• • •
IF YOU CAN'T SING, LET THE
QUARTET DUET.
