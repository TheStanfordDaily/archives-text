# THEATER TALK
## 
### T. R. C., '22 
Lots of Pep
A little speed is shown in both the j
| week-end offerings at the local movie I
| theatres. Constance Talmadge is j
I down at the Stanford in "Mamma's j
Affair," a breezy comedy containing!
the usual Talmadge trio of man. j
J Mother, and marriage, and imparting
i the usual Talmadge kick.
At the Varsity. Douglas Mac-Lean :
j makes a strong finish in "The Home]
Stretch." The star is seen as a ;
i jockey, who quits the racing game for j
' the love of a girl and then later, ]
when necessity demands it, rides the
| race of his life, saves* the old home
stead, wins the girl, 'n everything.
The Big Show Comes to Town
San Francisco will see what is liter
ally "the greatest of all musical come*
j dy hits" when "Irene" comes to the
i Curran, next week. liack in New j
York the original company started in
November 1910, and even now is sell
ing tickets six weeks in advance. That
breaks all records for a music al come
dy run.
"Irene" tells the familiar story of
I the rise from rags to riches of a
I little tenement girl, Irene O'Dare.
; There is nothing spectacular about it
j and the chorus girls wear long dress
j os. With all that against it, you may
; wonder why it succeeds so well hut
its dialogue is bright, its music catchy
and its heroine winsome. â€¢ As a co
ed might express it, the whole thing
is "awfully sweet."
Clothes and a Waltz
The song hit of the show is "My
Sweet Little Alice Blue Gown," an
appealing melody which deals with
one of the major thrills of girlhood.
Patti Harrold (daughter of Orville
Harrold, the tenor), is the leading lady
of the New York company, and she
sings the song in a way that would
make anyone want to help the little
modiste's model have that dress for
her very own.
Being a mere waltz number, "Alice
Blue Gown," never found much favor
on the West coast. We did hear it
in Techau's once but it was during
lunch hour and no one had to dance
to it.
