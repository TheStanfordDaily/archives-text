record yesterday, by capturing a hard

lucky seventh enabled two Sequoia men
to cross the home base for the winning
runs. The slabmen of each side hurled
with about equal success. Coplen, Delta
Chi twirler, also connected with a hit on
five trips to the plate. May, 011 the
mound for the opposition, did some good
work in the last inning, especially by

the bags. The score was tied three
times during the contest- In the first
period a Sequoia slugger registered for
a round trip. Tritle, Delta Chi short
stop, scored in the same period. Two
errors by the outfield and three hits

Conard's three-bagger, thus tying the
score. Another run was made by the
victors in the fourth. Delta Chi evened
matters again in the following period.
Three forfeits put El Toro, Kappa
Sigma, and Phi Kappa Sigma through
an easy sixth round of the intramural
sport. Kappa Sigma's nine played a
practice game with Alpha Chi Sigma,
winners of league five. Ihe former
aggregation romped around the bags
for twelve runs, and held the opposition
to one tally. Ncwlands exercised his
varsity arm to good effect for iKappa
Sigma. A little excitement was fur
nished by Spires, Dillon, and Newlands,
all of the same outfit, when each
whacked out a homer. Newlands per
formed his stunt with the bases loaded.
Aspinwall scored his team's lone mark in
the third inning.
