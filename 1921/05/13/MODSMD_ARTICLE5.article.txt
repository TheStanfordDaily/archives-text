### 
"It is the privilege of this year's
graduating class to bo foremost in
making the visiting alumni feel that
we are truly and sincerely glad to
have them with us. Alumni Day, to
morrow, brings close to us the thought
that we are soon to be members of
the alumni family, and it behooves
every one of the senior class to take
the lead in welcoming the alumni r>
morrow," declared Jack Patrick, presi
dent of the senior class, in urging that
the most be made of the opportunity

The students are to be at the Me
morial Court not later than 2:30, and
aie to immediately make themselves
acquainted with the alumni and offer
their assistance in showing the guests
about the campus or to the athletic
contests, is the plan of the committee
for making the visitors welcome.
There should be no hesitancy on the
part of the students, urged Melvin
Doyle, chairman, in getting acquaint
ed with the :i!umni from the first, as
the visiting grads are guests of the
senior class.
Response to the invitations sent out
tor the alumni banquet have exceeded
expectations, over 300 acceptances
having been received up to yesterday
evening. Large delegations are to
come up from L.os Angeles and o;her
southern points, while northern Cali
fornia cities are each to be repre
sented by numbers much in excess < f
expectations. It is feared that local
alumni will be forced to limit their
numbers attending the dinner to a
minimum.
The local committee in charge, faced
by this emergency, has arranged to serve

the same meal at an overflow dinner in
the Women's Clubhouse and has found
100 alumni who have agreed to eat their
dinner in the Women's Clubhouse, after
ward adjourning to Roble for the after
dinner program under the toastmaster
ship of Charles K. Field, '95. The diners
in the Women's Clubhouse will be fin
ished early enough make it possible
to begin the dance there at 9 o'clock as
scheduled.
A smaller number of alumni has found
it possible to get down to the luncheon

at nnon, but here also the number of
acceptances has exceeded expectations,
and 275 had said that they would be
present when the time was reached, clos
ing further acceptances. The luncheon
will overflow the reception room of the
President's house, where Mrs. Wilbur
had planned to hold it, and additional
tables have been placed in the court back
of the house which has been covered by
a canyuj mnrqu<-e ju preparation for the
luncheon.
The alumni committee in charge of
the dinner has found it necessary to re
strict the student attendance at the din
ner to eight representatives, whom they
have selected as follows: Floyd L. Mc-
Elroy, president of the Associated Stu
dents; Melvin E. Doyle, chairman of
the students' committee in charge of the
student program for the day; Anne
Hardy, in charge of the women's pro
gram for the day; Frederika McGee,
president of Roble Club; Dorothy John
ston, former president of Organized
Women; Wylie M. Kilpatrick, who has
