"College Men and the Economic Prob
lem," is the title of Edward H. Landels'
'21, reply to the article by Kyle in the
March issue on socialism. Kyle stated
that there are 12,00® college professors
associated to spread socialism among
college men. The point that Landels
brings out is that this is not particularly
alarming. It is not as a political view
point but as a solution to the economic
problems of the day, according to the
author. Men everywhere are concerned
in this and therefore it cannot be held
against the professors that they care to
put their trust in socialism, writes Lan
dels. He states the economic problem
and what men in all walks of life are
doing toward solving it, developing this
aspect more fully than the others.
Tom Irwin, '23, is the author of
"More Men in Class Three." That
doesn't mean the draft board or the
sorority house's phone list or a stadium
solicitor's returns, but is the last of the
three groups of men attending college
as classified by the author. ( lass one
is composed of specializcrs, class two
embraces all students of piping and
general aimlessness, and class three rep
resents the man who does not grub after
Thi Beta Kappa particularly, but goes
out for everything in the way of form
ing friendships and associations- The
athlete, the litcrateur and the class of
ficer are third class men, and Irwin tells
why they get the most out of college by
their belonging to that division. Ihe
article is another of the "why do we go
to college" kind, but the "A" man will
not get as much gratification out of this
one as the usual article offers.
The Pictorial will be on sale some
time next week.
