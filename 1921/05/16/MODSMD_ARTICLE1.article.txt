# TRADITION IS FOUNDED WHEN ALUMNI RE-UNITE IN CAMPUS GATHERING
## Banquet in Evening Establishes Precedent in Home-Comings for Graduates; Field Toastmaster 
### 
"A new Stanford tradition has
been established today," declared
Charles K. Field, '95, editor of the
Sunset Magazine, at the Alumni
Banquet Saturday evening. "The
Alunnii Day of the future will be
modeled after that of today—a re
union while the school year is in pro
gress, which happily makes possible
joint participation by both students
and graduates."
Nearly four hundred Stanford alum
ni spent Saturday on the "Farm" in
the first of Alumni Days held at a
time when the University plant is in
operation. Laying plans for the re
union but three weeks ago, the com
mittee in charge labored under the
difficulties of attempting an innova
tion in a short time and with appar

ently inadequate facilities for enter
taining the visitors. The number of
alumni who returned for the day
doubled the mark for which the opti
mistic had hoped. The two dining
rooms of Roble were crowded and only
by utilizing the Women's Clubhouse
could the entire number be provided
for for the evening banquet.
Entertaining those who arrived early
in the day, President and Mrs. Wilbur
were the host and hostess to the alum
ni at a luncheon in the Presidential
home. Present-day conditions at Stan
ford were analyzed by Dr. Wilbur, and
the problems of the University's future
requiring co-operation from her gradu
ates were outlined.
Scores of students representing
every living group on the campus
were in the courts of the Memorial
Church and outer Quadrangle from
2:30 to 3:30 to welcome the guests.
A brief concert was rendered by the
Stanford Band, while the student rep
resentatives were informally greeting
graduates of every class from '95
to '20. \ President McElroy of the
Associated Students in a short speech
expressed the desire of the sthdent
body to continue the cordial relation
ship between the undergraduates and
alumni begun by the reunion of the
day.
Various athletic events during the
later part of the afternoon gave to
the visitors an exhibition of a few
of Stanford's sports. A swimming
meet and water polo game in Encina
Pool was the first attraction and was
followed by a tennis tournament. A
'fast brand of polo, the newest of Stan
ford athletic activities, was played on
the field west of Encina Hall.
Concluding the program of the aft
ernoon, Warren D. Allen, in conjunc
tion with the Glee Club presented a
half-hour concert in the Memorial
Church. During the early evening the
various living groups were at home
to graduates who as students were
members of the Greek Letter houses
or clubs.
The banquet of the evening was
novel in so many features that it, like
the day, established a precedent for
alumni reunions. Cabaret entertain
ment featured the dinner, a selected
number of Junior Opera songs being
presented. Les Seib and Jack Heffer
nan formed a duo which was a dis
tinct hit, by singing several of the
latest campus favorites.
As toastmaster of the evening,
Charlie Field, veteran master of cere
monies, was in his best strain of
humor. Always adept in joshing the
Great and Near-Great, Field utilized
the opportunity to the utmost. While
his references to the officers of the
University were somewhat disquieting
to the undergraduates present, the
alumni relished his jokes on men
whom they had known as students.
Field cleverly introduced the members
of the Alumni Advisory Committee,
but a frame-up which became evident
during the course of the evening pre
vented any of them from speaking and
afforded opportunity for alumni cele
brities to harass the audience with
solemn injunction and sarcastic refer
ences to the toastmaster and "other
notables present." The dance in the
Women's Clubhouse was well attend
ed, both by students and guests.

Various athletic events during the
later part of the afternoon gave to
the visitors an exhibition of a few
of Stanford's sports. A swimming
meet and water polo game in Encina
Pool was the first attraction and was
followed by a tennis tournament. A
'fast brand of polo, the newest of Stan
ford athletic activities, was played on
the field west of Encina Hall.
Concluding the program of the aft
ernoon, Warren D. Allen, in conjunc
tion with the Glee Club presented a
half-hour concert in the Memorial
Church. During the early evening the
various living groups were at home
to graduates who as students were
members of the Greek Letter houses
or clubs.
The banquet of the evening was
novel in so many features that it, like
the day, established a precedent for
alumni reunions. Cabaret entertain
ment featured the dinner, a selected
number of Junior Opera songs being
presented. Les Seib and Jack Heffer
nan formed a duo which was a dis
tinct hit, by singing several of the
latest campus favorites.
As toastmaster of the evening,
Charlie Field, veteran master of cere
monies, was in his best strain of
humor. Always adept in joshing the
Great and Near-Great, Field utilized
the opportunity to the utmost. While
his references to the officers of the
University were somewhat disquieting
to the undergraduates present, the
alumni relished his jokes on men
whom they had known as students.
Field cleverly introduced the members
of the Alumni Advisory Committee,
but a frame-up which became evident
during the course of the evening pre
vented any of them from speaking and
afforded opportunity for alumni cele
brities to harass the audience with
solemn injunction and sarcastic refer
ences to the toastmaster and "other
notables present." The dance in the
Women's Clubhouse was well attend
ed, both by students and guests.
"A new Stanford tradition has
been established today," declared
Charles K. Field, '95, editor of the
Sunset Magazine, at the Alumni
Banquet Saturday evening. "The
Alunnii Day of the future will be
modeled after that of today—a re
union while the school year is in pro
gress, which happily makes possible
joint participation by both students
and graduates."
Nearly four hundred Stanford alum
ni spent Saturday on the "Farm" in
the first of Alumni Days held at a
time when the University plant is in
operation. Laying plans for the re
union but three weeks ago, the com
mittee in charge labored under the
difficulties of attempting an innova
tion in a short time and with appar

ently inadequate facilities for enter
taining the visitors. The number of
alumni who returned for the day
doubled the mark for which the opti
mistic had hoped. The two dining
rooms of Roble were crowded and only
by utilizing the Women's Clubhouse
could the entire number be provided
for for the evening banquet.
Entertaining those who arrived early
in the day, President and Mrs. Wilbur
were the host and hostess to the alum
ni at a luncheon in the Presidential
home. Present-day conditions at Stan
ford were analyzed by Dr. Wilbur, and
the problems of the University's future
requiring co-operation from her gradu
ates were outlined.
Scores of students representing
every living group on the campus
were in the courts of the Memorial
Church and outer Quadrangle from
2:30 to 3:30 to welcome the guests.
A brief concert was rendered by the
Stanford Band, while the student rep
resentatives were informally greeting
graduates of every class from '95
to '20. \ President McElroy of the
Associated Students in a short speech
expressed the desire of the sthdent
body to continue the cordial relation
ship between the undergraduates and
alumni begun by the reunion of the
day.
