# Team Fails to Appear For Saturday Contest
## 
### 
With his men in uniform and the
stage all set for a fast display of
diamond artistry on the local lot, Sat
urday afternoon, Coach Seay was
notified just an hour before the sched
uled contest that the Ratner All-Stars
would not be able to put in an ap
pearance. According to some of tho
Cards who had broken into Week-end
plans in order to play, this short notice
idea is not an agreeable arrangement
for baseball schedules.
