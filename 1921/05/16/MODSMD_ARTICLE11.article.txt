The Board of Athletic Control this morning announced the adoption of a
rearrangement of the supervision of the Department of Physical Education
for Men, upon the recommendation of President Wilbur, which etiij further
carries out a plan for the division of duties and responsibilities which was
originally suggested by Dr. A. D. Browne, head of the department, and has
this year been put irlto limited effect.
Dr. Browne found that the burden of responsibilities upon him in meet
ing all the problems of the department, especially in making the required
physical examinations of men students, was so great that he could not carry
that and at the same time personally supervise the conduct of all the ath
letic program of the University. With the consent of the Advisory Board
this year he has therefore, shifted a considerable proportion of the responsi
bilities for the conduct of athletics upon Walter Powell, who has bornt- Ihe
title of Director of Major Intercollegiate Athletics.
By the plan which has now meen adopted Dr. Browne will be relieved
of all executive responsibilities in relation to the conduct of athletics in order
that he may devote himself exclusively to the other side of his duties and

Poweil has been made Acting Execu
tive Officer for the Gymnacium and

sports.
Since Powell's time will be so much
more occupied than formerly w<th
these new duties an additional in
structor in American football will be
added to the staff of the Physical Edu
cation Department next year, who will
be the field coach.
