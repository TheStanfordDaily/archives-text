# PROMOTIONS AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES
## 
### 
With thorough approval the student body will receive today the
announcement of the reorganization of the scheme of responsibilities
in physical education and athletics. Dr. P>rowne as head of both activi
ties has often made clear to the Board of Control that the duties of
entire responsibility in both fields have been too broad for one man.
Relieving him now from all duties in connection with athletics, his new
position as head of physical education and corrective gymnastics will
enable him to devote to this work the time which, according to his own
recommendation, he has been unable to find this year.
We are glad to see Walter 1). Powell placed in active charge of
athletics. Powell's ambitions have always been more in the sphere of
athletic directorship than in narrower field coaching, and the action of
the board now makes him general supervisor of Stanford athletics for
f.ext year.
