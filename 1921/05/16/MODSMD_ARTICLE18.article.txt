# A 						NEW TRADITION

### 
The co-chairmen of the student committee on Alumni Day, Miss
Anne Hardy, *21, and Melvin (•!. Doyle, '21, are to be congratulated on
(he entire success of the undertaking. Although not as many students
as were first expected turned out at the Memorial Court at 2:30 p.m.,
thoroughly respectable number was present. In every way the day \vun
successful. The afternoon program was well attended, and the evening
banquef with student cabaret presented a little of the unexpected to
the great amusement of the old-timers.
The students too, would like to extend a word of appreciation to
Charles K. Field, '95, who really gave us the opportunity of asking the
alumni to visit the University, and whose endeavor brought them down
in such unexpected numbers. His presiding as toastmaster at Roble
was actually the great feature of the day.
Field, in co-operation with the alumni and student committees, pro
moted a real Alumni Day, the success of which is testified to by every
graduate who returned to the campus.
The graduates were entertained, and they were also brought in
touch with the more serious side of University problems. The ties of
the Stanford spirit were broadened and renewed, and an actual consci
ousness of the University and its welfare was left with the 4 former
students.
Undoubtedly this new Alumni Day during the actual college year
will be conducted on a much larger scale next year when the facilities
of the new Union may be drawn upon, and we may say without question
that a •new and most worth-while tradition has been established.
