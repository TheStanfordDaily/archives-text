# Cap and Gown Will Give Tea Wednesday Afternoon
## 
### 
The regular Cap and Gown tea will be
given in the Women's Clubhouse
Wednesday afternoon from 4 to 6 for
the benefit of the Women's Clubhouse
fund. Cap and Gown requests that all
women who can possibly do so drop in
and have a chat with their friends and
incidentally help the cause along. Any
one wishing to reserve card tables
should telephone Elizabeth Patton.
