Oh! Look at the Girls
if you want to see a bunch of bath
ing girls displayed in good form but
poor construction, try "Up in Mary's
Attic," down at the Stanford. Speak
ing of a well-knit plot, the bathing
suits lay a greater claim to that ad
jective than the rambling story of this
picture but it at least affords a chance
to exhibit the girls in all sorts of
poses.
The little baby in the picture
(imagine what a scandal it creates
in a young ladies' seminary) is quite
the cutest thing we have seen in a
long time. The old Indian woman
who smokes a pipe, an intelligent dog,
and some torchlight scenes in a cave,
are things of note In a production
which has several episodic points of
interest, but. is utterly lacking in
unity.
Anothes Feather for the Farm
New York has to hand it to the
Stanford Farm for supplying the lead
ing man for one of the most success
ful comedies now on Broadway. The
play in question is "The Bad Man,"
} and Holbrook Blinn, '96, takes the
leading role. Critics rank this show
i as one of the two best comedies the
season has brought forth.
In his college days, Blinn was presi
| dent of his class and was one of the
! first editors oi the Daily Palo Alto.
! The fact that a man of that caliber
| should go on the stage may revise
some old-fp,ahioned notions about the
kind of people who become "play
actors."
Gossip of Quality Folks
Speaking of good people on the
stage, reminds us that two members
of America's foremost theatrical
family, John and Ethel Barrymore,
are appearing together in a new play,
"Clair de Lune." This play was greet
ed by probably the most distinguish
ed first night audience of the year,
: but it ff'll absolutely flat. It is in no
way considered worthy of its elaborate
production or the talent <>.! its play
ci s.
Ethel Barrymore, who is really Mrs.
Russoll Colt and the mother of three
big children, dazz»«d Broadway by her
beauty. Which is rather remarkable
when you rorrider that she is getting
along iii years and eyen in her younger
days was always more famous for
lu*r ability than for her good looks.
It. is a costume play, and perhaps the
white wig she wears helps out. some.
