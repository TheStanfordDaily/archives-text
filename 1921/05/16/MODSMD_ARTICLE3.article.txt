# INFORMAL RECEPTION GIVEN TO LAW ALUMNI
## 
### 
As a part of the Alumni home-com
ing, returning graduates were
entertained Friday evening at a re
ception given in their honor under the
auspices of the Law School faculty,
in the Law Building. Members of the
classes which are to receive thoir de
grees this June and September were
also present.
Most of the alumni were those who
graduated recently, although some of
the older men were there. Among the
latter was George E. Crothers, former
trustee of the University, and Judgo
of the Superior Court of San Francisco.
There was no regular program or
speeches, the evening being devoted
to an informal 'get-together.' Re
freshments were served by the wives
of the members of the Law Faculty.
