## 
### 
Dr. R. N- West, "Life Work" Com
missioner of the North Baptist Conven
tion, addressed the local members of the
Y. M. C. A. at luncheon yesterday. Dr.
West is touring the United States,
speaking particularly at educational in
stitutions, in the interests of the inter
denominational movement, the object of
which is to arouse in young men and
women an appreciation of the need for
their life service.
Dr. West said in part: "There is, on
the part of all serious men, a conscious
ness that we cannot put the civilization
of six years ago together again The
time has come that we have to recog
nize that man is worth more than the
acre of land around which the old civil
ization was centered. Service must take
the place of self-centered activityâ€”serv
ice for the betterment of mankind. In
that, the universities must take a lead
ing part."
