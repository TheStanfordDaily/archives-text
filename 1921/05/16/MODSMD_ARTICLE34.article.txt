### 
Eliot Grinnell Mears, Acting Profes
sor of Economics, writes "The Oppor
tunities for College Men in Foreign
Trade," for the May issue of the Pic
torial. Professor Mears is on leave of
absence from the United States Depart
ment of Commerce, where he has the
post of Trade Commissioner, and during
his service in this department he has
gathered much valuable data which he
presents in his article.
Professor Mears says that the foreign
commerce of this country has increased
six-fold during the last generation ; $13.-
394,000,000 was the figure which our 1920
trade amounted to. He mentions the
fact that Herbert Hoover, in his capacity
of Secretary of Commerce, has been
continually emphasizing the importance
of foreign trade to America and has
been urging college men to prepare for
this business, which is still far from
over-crowded.
The author goes on to tell the quali
fications which every man actively en
gaged in foreign trade must' have. Lan
guage, preferably French and Spanish,
more if possible, and many other details,
art necessary in this occupation. In this
respect the college-trained man has an
advantage over the non-college man. In
the Standard Oil Company a special
school has been established to educate
their representatives in foreign markets.
Even these specially traind men are slow
to advance, though, Professor Mears
says, in comparison to the college man,
and here a college man can assure him
self a chance to show bis initiative.
In conclusion, the author states, " 1 he
college man who feels a genuine interest
in international trade, who is prepared
to spend two to five years abroad, who
is willing to be patient while he finds his
proper place in a comparatively new and
not overcrowded field of good oppor
tunities and a sure future-â€”this man will
make no mistake in concluding that the
choice of foreign trade as his vocation
should lead to an attractive and worth
while career."
