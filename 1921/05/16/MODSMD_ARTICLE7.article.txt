## 
### 
"Chappie" gravely announces that the
next issue of the comic, which appears on
the Quad for sale the latter part of
the week, will he a "humorous" number.
An enigmatic silence surrounds the an
nouncement, though Editor Harzfeld is
deeply hurt by the implication that the
other issues of the year have not been
humorous.
What announcements that the guard
ian of the trusty Hammer is willing to
make indicates that "Chappie" in its
May issue is achieving the unusual. The
local Underwood artists have composed
a series of take-offs on famous humor
ists, deceased and living, which are illus
trated by sketches of campus Waterman
artists. The bones of Sam Butler and
Sir Roger de Covcrly arc rattled in a
lively manner by their modern imitators.
Ring Lardner, Walt Mason, Leacock,
and George Ade will be able to sec
themselves stalking through the pages
of the May issue.
Equally racy will be the page satiriz
ing newspaper and comic artists of the
day. Fred Fisher, '24, has sketched the
page which handles his namesake, Bud
Fisher, without gloves. By relating the
take-offs to campus situations and celeb
rities, "Chappie" has made a unique com
bination of the style of national humor
ists and the subject matter of campus
gossip.
