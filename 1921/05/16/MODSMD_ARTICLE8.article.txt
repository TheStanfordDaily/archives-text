# ALPHA SIGMA PHI WINS SWIM MEET
## Fletcher and Greppin Are Big Point-Winners of Day; Phi Delta Theta Places Second 
### 
Alpha Sigma Phi won the fourth
annual inter-fraternity swimming meet
held Saturday afternoon at Encina
pool, roiling up 34 points. Phi Delta
Theta came second with 27, Alpha
Delta Phi third with IS, and Delta Up
silon fourth with 12. Chi Psi got three
points, while Delta Tau Delta and
Beta Theta Pi annexed one each.
The most exciting event of the af
ternoon was the four-man relay, in
which Phi Delta Theta nosed out
Alpha Sigma Phi by a few inches,
after an even battle all the way. Fair
time was made in most of the events,
Mills' plunge of 64 feet and Fletcher's
time of 49 seconds in the 66-yard
breast stroke, being exceptionally
good.
Fletcher for Phi Delta Theta and
Greppin for Alpha Sigma Phi were
the big point-winners of the day, each
taking two first places. Darling, the
varsity swimming captain, and Mills
each made eight points, while Lacey
got seven and Goddard six. The win
ning team placed in six out of the
eight events, making most of their
points in the plunge and 220. Phi
Delta Theta placed in every event ex
cept in the plunge, and Alpha Delta
Phi missed out only in diving and the
plunge.
The winner will now have its name
engraved on the Wideman trophy, the
perpetual prize that is offered each
year. Last year it was won by Delta
Tau Delta, and the two years before
by Chi Psi.

Alpha Sigma Phi won the fourth
annual inter-fraternity swimming meet
held Saturday afternoon at Encina
pool, roiling up 34 points. Phi Delta
Theta came second with 27, Alpha
Delta Phi third with IS, and Delta Up
silon fourth with 12. Chi Psi got three
points, while Delta Tau Delta and
Beta Theta Pi annexed one each.
The most exciting event of the af
ternoon was the four-man relay, in
which Phi Delta Theta nosed out
Alpha Sigma Phi by a few inches,
after an even battle all the way. Fair
time was made in most of the events,
Mills' plunge of 64 feet and Fletcher's
time of 49 seconds in the 66-yard
breast stroke, being exceptionally
good.
Fletcher for Phi Delta Theta and
Greppin for Alpha Sigma Phi were
the big point-winners of the day, each
taking two first places. Darling, the
varsity swimming captain, and Mills
each made eight points, while Lacey
got seven and Goddard six. The win
ning team placed in six out of the
eight events, making most of their
points in the plunge and 220. Phi
Delta Theta placed in every event ex
cept in the plunge, and Alpha Delta
Phi missed out only in diving and the
plunge.
The winner will now have its name
engraved on the Wideman trophy, the
perpetual prize that is offered each
year. Last year it was won by Delta
Tau Delta, and the two years before
by Chi Psi.
The results of the events follow:
Relay—Won by Phi Delta Theta;
Alpha Sigma Phi, second; Alpha Delta
Phi, third; Delta Upsilon, fourth.
Diving—Won by Lacey (I)U); God
dard (ASP), second; Edwards (PDT),
third; Fullerton (Beta Theta Pi),
fourth.
