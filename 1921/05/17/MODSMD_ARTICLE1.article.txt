Armenia, Miss Farrington was able to
make a thorough study of their needs,
and she brings an earnest appeal to this
country for aid to keep these children
alive until a stable government can take
over the task of caring for them.
The Near East Relief was incorpo
rated by Congress in 1919 to care for the
needy in Armenia and the surrounding
countries, and has officially taken over


From Near East Relief, Greek Refugee
Camp, Batoum
;t 11 of the relief work of the American j
Red Cross in Syria and Palestine. The
Relief operates from Constantinople to
Bagdad, from Port Said to Baku, from
Persia to Palestine, and has as it*, chief
undertaking the feeding and clothing of
the helpless children who have heen left
without any means of sustenance after
the war. A tahle twenty-four miles long
is maintained and 229 orphanages and 63
hospitals are kept up.
Estimates made by the Relief commit
tee show that $5 a month will save the
life of one child, $10 a month will feed
and clothe a child, and $15 a month will |
feed, clothe ami educate one of these
children. It is with these figures in j
mind and with the earnest hope that ,
every American citizen will accept the '
responsibility of saving a child s life
that speakers for the Near East Relef i
j will make their appeal tonight.
