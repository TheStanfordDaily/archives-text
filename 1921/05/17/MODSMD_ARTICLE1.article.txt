The lives of 110,000 children in these
stricken countries depend on the re-

sponse of America to the call for $30,-
000,000 to maintain the work being car
ried on by the Near East Relief, accord
ing to the national committee. Judge
Wilbur will outline the work of the Re
lief and will tell of the part which Cali
fornia is depended upon to take in the
present canvass. Judge Wilbur, now
Justice of the Supreme Court of Cali
fornia, was for many 'years a juvenile
judge in Los Angeles, and during that
time had ample opportunity to study the
needs of the children of the poor.
Miss Farrington will furnish first-hand
information on the conditions in the
devastated countries of the Nea/ - East,
having only recently relumed fioni work
in those sections. During theÂ»two years
which she spent in organizing and taking
care of the destitute children in Eastern
Armenia, Miss Farrington was able to
make a thorough study of their needs,
and she brings an earnest appeal to this
country for aid to keep these children
alive until a stable government can take
over the task of caring for them.
The Near East Relief was incorpo
rated by Congress in 1919 to care for the
needy in Armenia and the surrounding
countries, and has officially taken over
