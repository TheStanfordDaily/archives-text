# ARTILLERY UNIT TO GIVE PROGRAM OF AFTERNOON EVENTS
## 
### 
Exhibitions of a three-inch battery in
action, horsemanship, races between
tractors towing cannon, co-education in
the military department, and a polo
match, are included in the program for
the Military Field Day next Saturday
afternoon. On this occasion all phases
of the work of Stanford's artillery unit
will be presented to the campus public.
To start off the ceremonies, the entire
unit will be reviewed on the polo field
by officers of Stanford and of the Ninth
Corps from the Presidio. The reviewing
stand will be passed twice, first at a
walk, then with the horses trotting. This
will be followed by the formal presenta
tion of commissions by President Wil
bur. first to the reserve officers who have
completed the course, then to the cadet
officers.
In the section contest between the dif
ferent groups of the unit, ten to twenty
rounds will be fired from the three-inch
pieces. Following this, the horses will
be brought up, harnessed and hitched,
and guns run off the field. This feature
of the contest promises to be interesting,
as the horses are often difficult to man
age after cannon have been fired, and
several - caissons have been smashed in
practice.
A tortuous course will be laid out on
tlie polo field, over which the tractors
arc to drag 3-inch and 4.7 guns in a
speed and obstacle race. Intensive prac
tice has been gone through for the
hurdles contest, coming next on the list
of events. The hurdles are placed in a
square of four ,and each contestant must
put his mount over the jumps twice.
Winners will be judged on form, and
ability to "stick."
First and foremost in the interest of
the campus will be the drill to be put on
by the members of the Women's Equita
tion Class. Practice has been going on
for the past two quarters, and some
markable evolutions are promised.
An exhibition of high jumping which
will furnish many thrills and surprises
has been promised by the stunt riders
as the next course on the bill of fare.
Following this will come the polo game
between Stanford and San Mateo. The
latter team has one of the best players
in the country, and a rare exhibition of
