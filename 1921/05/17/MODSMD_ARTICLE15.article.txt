# A 						CHANCE TO TRY

### 
Many men from I lie bleachers who have watched Captain Kirksey
break tlie tape at the end of a hundred in 9 3-5 have wondered how
many seconds they themselves would require to travel over the course
of the "century." There is a certain lure about the track that challenges
every live man who watches a meet, and yet many never award them
selves the privilege of donning a suit and getting out on the oval.
Intramural track affords every man an opportunity to try himself
in every event, and in company of his own ability. It also offers all a
chapce to add to the total point column of his particular group or house
that may place it well up in the competition results, for even a very
modest showing will register points.
And there is above all this the possibility of varsity material. In
track there are many events, and most men of common physique will
find some one or two for which they are fairly fitted. If five hundred
t'.ovices take a try at the broad jump, there may be ten or more who
make from seventeen to twenty feet, and some of these may be capable
of several feet better in a year's training, which would make them real
varsity competitors.
Men may now try in the events on the oval at any time during the
afternoon. Those who try will gain the benefit of excellent exercise
and good-natured competition; they will add to the point column of
their organization; and they may discover some one of real varsity fibre
among their numbers.
