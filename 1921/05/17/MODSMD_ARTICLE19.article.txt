# Professor Kelley Holds Eminent Rank in Field of Statistical Methods
## 
### 
Dr. Trueman Lee Kelley,' professor
of Education, is considered to be the
best expert in the United States in
statistical methods as applied to psy
chological and social problems. His
work along this line has included
practical work in the field, teaching,
and a great many publications. He
is primarily a mathematician and psy
chologist and since the completion
of his undergraduate work his main
field of study has been the "analysis
of capacity," which has to do with the
various traits and characteristics,
both intellectual and non-intellectual,
pertinent to success in various voca
tions and professions. The most fitting
characterization of Dr. Kelley's life
so far would be to say that it has
been one of intense activity coupled
witli an accomplishment which is re
markable for a man under forty
years of age.
Professor Kelley was born at Muske
gon, Michigan, in 1884, and received
his early education Irom the high
school and manual training school
there. In 1903 he entered Minnesota
University where he completed his
freshman year and then transferred
to the University of Illinois, receiv
ing his A. B. in 1909, and his M. A.
in 1911. While at Illinois he majored
in mathematics and psychology. Soon
after receiving his M.A. degree Pro-
Kelley came to California, and
was married to Miss Laura Osgood
Rogers, and started teaching in the
Fresno High School and Junior Col
lege. From Fresno he went to Colum
bia and obtained his Ph.D. in 1914,
continuing his work along mathema
tical and psychological lines and work
ing under Professors Thorndike,
Dewey, and others. ' Before complet
ing his work at Columbia he accepted
a position as Consulting Psychologist
at Culver Military Academy. After
a year in this capacity he was given
an assistant professorship at the Uni
versity of Texas, where he remained
for three years.
It might be well to say that during
his college training Professor Kelley
alternated his academic work with
â– employment in business, engineering,
and teaching capacities. He has
taught for the period of a summer
session or longer at the Georgia insti
tute of Technology, George Peabody
4

College for Teachers, and the Univer
sity of Illinois, Texas, Washington,
and Columbia. The years from 1917
to 1920 were divided between teach
ing at Teachers' College, Columbia
University, and positions with the
War Department. These activities
included: A survey or army schools,
study of English trade test methods,
and work in the establishment of the
trade test procedure for the Commit
tee on Classification of personnel in
the army; work in the Division of
Psychology in the derivation of non
verbal tests for the examination of
recruits; and statistical adviser in the
administration of the S. A. T. C. rating
scheme for officer material. During
the summer of 1919, Dr. Kelley was
Chief Statistician of the Elementary
School Intelligence Examination
Board of the National Research Coun
cil. He is at present a member of
the Committee on the Mathematical
Analysis of Statistics of the Division
of Physical Science of the National
Research Council.
Dr. Kelley's publications include:
"Educational Guidance, an Analysis
and Prediction of the Ability of High
School Students"; I "Mental Aspects
of Delinquency"; "Tables to Facili
tate the Calculation of Partial Co
efficients of Correlation and Regres
sion Equations"; and "Chart for the
Evaluation of Certain Correlation
Functions." His main labor for the
last two years has been the writing
of a treatise on Social Statistics which
will be published by MacMillan Co.
within a few months. He is a Fellow
in the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and a mem
ber of American Statistical Associa
tion; American Psychological Associa
tion; National Association of Direc
tors of Educational Research.
When time and leisure permit, Pro
fessor Kelley likes to get out into the
open places, and mountain climbing
is his favorite of sports. When duty
prevents this he gives vent to his
desire for physical activity by a
plunge in Encina Pool or by rounds
at. tennis and handball. Accompanied
by Mrs. Kelley, he plans to spend the
bettor part of next year in England
where is expects to conduct certain
investigations under Karl Pearson, the
world's most eminent statistician.
