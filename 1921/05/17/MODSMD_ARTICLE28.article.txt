# Donald Snedden Starts On Motorcycle Trip
## 
### 
Donald Sneddon, '23, a student at
Stanford last year, left the campus Sun
day on a journey across the continent to
New York by motorcycle. This is the
second transcontinental trip that Sned
don has made. In 1919 he traveled from
New York to Stanford on a motorcycle.
A month before the present trip Sneddon
had landed at San Francisco after a ten
months' voyage around the world in a
sailing vessel. The voyage included
only one stop in the ten months, which
was made at Cape Town, Africa. Sned
don has appeared in diving exhibitions
with Pinkston, and won third place in
the national diving contest held at Idora
Park Sunday. He intends to return to
Stanford next fall quarter. Sneddon is
a member of Alpha Tau Omega.
