# FIRST INTRAMURAL WATER POLO GAMES ARE HELD TODAY
## 
### 
Intramural water polo, which was:
due to start yesterday, began to- j
day, as the track meet made it impos- j
sible for many of the players to be
present.
The contest between Alpha Sigma |
Phi and El Capitan, scheduled for
yesterday, will be held Thursday, and
on that day there will be a double
header, as Palo Alto will play Se
quoia. Today's game is between En
cina West and Chi Psi.
No change in the inter-class water!
polo championship results as a conse-;
quence of the game Saturday, Coach i
Brandsten announced yesterday. The;
freshman beat the juniors Saturday,!
7-6, and as the juniors had been de-1
clared champions following the series
of inter-class contests, the freshmen
would have been in line for the prize,
| except that the game was understood
i to be only an exhibition event.
Varsity swimming plans are still ift
obeyance awaiting a reply from Stock
ton as to the chance of playing their
team there. Plans for the trip have
been made for some time and as soon
as Stockton replies favorably the local

swimmers will make the journey.
Swimming and water polo captains
have not yet been chosen, but the
varsity squads will be called together
soon to elect their leaders for next
year.
