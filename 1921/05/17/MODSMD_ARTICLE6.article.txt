Wheeler. The wife is of a jealous and
haughty disposition, and keeps her hus

June 15.
Booth Tarkington's famous and widely
produced play, "Clarence," has been se
lected for this year's Senior Farce. The
clever character parts offered in "Clar
ence"' led to its being chosen, as well as
the fact that it has had long and suc
cessful runs in New York, Chicago, and
San Francisco.
Florence Pixley, '23, will appear in the
leaiTing ingenue role as Violet Pinney.
She has had considerable experience in
amateur productions, and did excellent
work in the Sophomore play, "Wedding

Bells." The part is one which requires
poise and an even, low voice. Miss Pix
ley has these qualifications, and Coach
Gordon Davis chose her for the part for
these reasons. She is a member of
Alpha Omicron Pi.
Paul Claflin, '22, will undertake the
exceedingly difficult lead, Clarence. This
is a part which necessitates infinite caic
in interpretation, and Claflin was chosen
largely because of his outstanding work
in the 1921 Ram's Head show, when lie
appeared as the Englishman. He is a
member of Phi Delta Theta-
Cora, the woman's character lead, has
been given to Lucille Mitchell, '21. The
part is that uf a small girl about thirteen
years old and, excepting perhaps Bobby,
it is the hardest part in the play. Miss
Mitchell showed up extremely well in
the tryouts, and although this will be, her !
first campus appearance, she has had I
training elsewhere. She is an Alpha I
Phi.
The part of Bobby, an exceedingly
difficult one, that of a young boy, will be
played by George Powell, '23. Orig
inally Bobby was interpreted by Gregory
Kelly, in the New York production, and
was the hit of the show. Powell is new
to campus dramatics, but Coach Davis
considers him a "find." Powell is a
Kappa Sigma.
Vera Pernau, '22, and Robert Patton,
'22, will act the parts of Mrs. and Mr
Wheeler. The wife is of a jealous and
haughty disposition, and keeps her hus
band constantly in hot water. Miss Per
nau has not appeared on the campus be
fore, but Patton made himself known in
"Pierre of the Plains." The former is
an Alpha Phi, while Patton is a member
of Sequoia Club.
Margaret Howard, '21, will take the
part of Delia, the housemaid, and Charles
Arnn, '21, that of Dinwiddie, the butler.
Miss Howard is a member of Kappa
Alpha Theta. Arnn has appeared sev
eral times on the campus, and will be re
membered in the Ram's Head show two
years ago and in "Pierre of the Plains."
T. H. Kennedy, '23, will play the part
of Hubert Stem. Mollie Windish, '21,
is to play Mrs. Martyn. She appeared
in the English Club play, the "Yellow
Jacket," this year. Miss Windish is a
member of Roble Club.
So much talent turned out for the
parts that Coach Davis had difficulty in
selecting many of the parts. Rehearsals
have begun and will be continued up to
the final week- The play will be given
June 15.
