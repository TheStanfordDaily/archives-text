# STANFORD TENNIS TEAM WILL ENTER COAST TOURNAMENT
## Cardinal Squad Will Compete With all Coast Teams but Main Contest is With U. C. 
### 
Stanford's tennis team, which will in
vade the East this summer, will enter in
the Pacific Coast conference tennis
tournament to be held in conjunction
with the Coast Conference track meet
to be staged at Eugene this week-end.
The tennis tournament this year is to be
the first complete tourney to ever be hey
by the conference and every university
has registered a team.
Nothing much is known of the quality
of the teams at Washington State Col
lege or either of the Oregon universities.
The University of Washington has one
good man on its team, however, in Mar
shall Allen, and judging from the battle
he gave Jimmy Davies in the conference
meet here last spring, lie should make a
good showing. From the present dope
on the tournament, the championship
will be fought out between the old rivals,
Stanford and California.
In the dual tournament with Califor
nia, the Cardinal players were defeated
by the steadier playing of the California
racqueters. The Stanford team had just
started their season, however, and
showed the lack of practice. In games
at the Ojai tourney and in the San Fran
cisco city championships, the Cardinal
men have shown a vast improvement
over their early season playing, and at
the present rate of progress should be
able to retain the Coast title for another
year.
Jimmy Davies and Captain Phil Neer,
chosen to represent Stanford in the
Coast tournament, left for Portland
Sunday night and will spend the entire
week in practice matches on the Mult
nomah Club courts in the Rose City.
Jimmy Davies, winner of the Pacific
Coast Conference singles championship
for 1920, will defend his title in this
event, while Neer and Davies have a
good chance of again taking the Coast
Conference doubles championship.
Following the Pacific Coast Confer
ence tournament, the Stanford team will
start their invasion of the eastern uni
versities. The first match of their trip
will he played at the University of
| Washington on May 23, and from here
i they will go direct to Chicago, where
â–  they will he pitted against the middle
| western universities.
