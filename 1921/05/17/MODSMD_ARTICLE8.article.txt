of the Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity and others from civilian life will
also be present. The San Mateo Polo
Club, which will play a polo match here
that afternoon, has accepted an
tion to be present at the ball. "
Mrs. Wilbur will give a dinner at her
home prior to the ball in honor of the
visiting military officials, thfc Trustees
and Mrs. Hoover, who will act as pa
trons and patronesses at the affair.
Extensive preparations have been
made by the committees in charge to
make it one of the most successful
dances ever held on the campus. Whit
mer's orchestra will furnish the music,
which will be approximately the same as
that furnished for the Junior Prom-
Novel decorations are planned which
will give a military atmosphere to the
hall.
The color scheme will be red, white
and blue, which will be carried out in
the decorations and on the programs.
At one end of the Encina ballroom a
model military encampment will be erect
ed as an additional military touch to the
scene. Field pieces will be brought in'"
and distributed about the floor in such
a way as to make a pleading ei'rect of
the military in all respects. A new sys
tem of indirect lighting has been evolved
for the dance and no glaring lights will
be in evidence.
A bugle call before each dance, which
will be announced by name, will be a
unique innovation smacking of the mili
tary. Refreshments will be served after
"mess call," and the dance will end to
"taps." There will be twelve dances.
The programs will be ready for dis
tribution Thursday. They embody some
new ideas in this respect, being of thick
white satin stock embossed with crossed
cannons on the front and in the center a
torch. The red, white and blue color
scheme-is carried out in the cords which
are attached to the programs. Two hun
dred tickets have been printed at $3.50
each, of which number approximately
half have been sold at the present time-
Betty McGee, '21. will act as student
hostess for the affair, taking part in in
troducing the patrons and patronesses.
The committee in charge desires'to em
phasize the fact that military uniforms
are not required at the dance. Formal
dress, either civilian or military, will
answer.
