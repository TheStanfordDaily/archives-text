# NEEDS OF NEAR EAST COUNTRIES ARE DESCRIBED
## Speakers Make Plea for Funds to Provide For Starving Children In Asia Minor 
### 
T he hope of the destitute nations of
the Near East lies in America's re
sponse to the present campaign for
funds, according to Judge Curtis Wilbur,
state chairman of the Near East Relief,
who spoke at the meeting held in the
Assembly Hall last night.
"Such men as Andrew Mellon, Secre
tary of Treasury, James L. Barton, and
Cleveland H. Dodge are putting their
efforts into the campaign to raise the
$30,OCX),000 which is needed to save the
children of these needy countries, and
they should be given the aid of every
American citizen," said Judge Wilbur.
He spoke especially of the relief work
in Persia, of which he has a personal
knowledge. He told of a number of
missionaries there whom he had known
personally who had given their lives in
caring for the destitute. "The people of
Persia look to America as their salva-.
tion," said Judge Wilbur. "The Ameri
can flag more than once has saved them
from the ravages of the Turks, and they 1
do not forget."
Mabel Farrington followed Judge Wil
bur by describing conditions as she saw
them during practically two years of
service among the destitute children of
eastern Armenia. "The lives of these
children depend on the aid which is
given by America," said Miss
ton. "The Near East Relief is now
caring for 110,000 children and it should
be providing for 250,000. The hardest
thing we had to do was to turn pleading
children away from the doors of our
orphanages because we had no room
for them
"You think you know what dirt and
filth is," continued Miss Farrington,
"but you have no real idea of it until
you see Armenia. The children come to
its in droves, ragged, emaciated, and
crying for food. Their feet were often
cut and bleeding from walking without
shoes, their eyes were hollow, the cheeks
sunken, and the skin so drawn and
wrinkled that a child of five looked like
a man of sixty."
Five dollars a month will save the life
of a child, ten dollars a month will feed
and clothe the child, and fifteen dollars
will feed, clothe, and educate a child.
Miss Harrington described the work of
educating the children which the Relief
is endeavoring to effect because of the
vital importance to the future of these
countries. "It is the ambition of every
Armenian child to come to America, re
ceive an education and return to his
country to instruct fellows," said
Miss Farrington.
Miss Farrington used slide* showing
the actual life of the children, and the
care which they are receiving from the
Near East Relief. She urged that every
one do something in contributing toward
the fund because every penny will aid in
saving a life.
