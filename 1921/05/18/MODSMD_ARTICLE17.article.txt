# STEPPING OFF IN EARNEST
## 
### 
Joseph j. Mickey's, assumption of the stadium campaign manager
ship is the latest and most significant step ih the progress of the Stanford
bowl project. Jlickey is a member of the younger group of alumni in
San I'Yancisco, a newspaper man and publicity expert. 11 is ap]x>int
nieut by the Hoard of Athletic Control means that this body now demands
an intensive campaign for the procurement of stadium finances.
The letter campaign with which the Hoard started the stadium plan
was very successful for that kind of a measure. It brought in approxi
mately $35,(XX) and served to acquaint the public with the Stanford
project and its peculiar attributes.
Mickey will now begin the campaign in earnest. The coming meet
ing al the Fairmont I lotel will be the initial blow in the interests of future
Stanford athletics, and re|xÂ»rts indicate that it will be more than an
empty publicity stunt.
Stanford students may now expect to hear real returns on the pros
pect of a new stadium. And more than this, they will probably be
called on for aid, certainly in matters of stunts, "talking up," and pub
licity, and possibly by way of financial assistance. This all important
athletic project demands the co-operation and active assistance of all
then of Stanford.
