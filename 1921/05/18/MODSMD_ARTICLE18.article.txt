# AN INDEPENDENT
## 
### 
In Chester K. Rowel I, who will speak at the University assembly
tomorrow, the Public Kxercises Committee has secured a man of uni
versity interest. Rowell editor of a "small town" paper, the Fresno
J*cpublican, attracted nation-wide attention because of the quality and
depth of his views.
Furthermore, Rowel! is an independent, a man who is not afraid to
speak, lie might be termed a member of the "Hoover school" of public
men; his services are sought by every sort of public enterprise from the
Hoard of Regents of the University of California (of which he is not
a graduate) to the Shipping Hoard at Washington.
Me is the type of speaker we like to find on the University exercises
program, and one who can make the assembly hour count.
