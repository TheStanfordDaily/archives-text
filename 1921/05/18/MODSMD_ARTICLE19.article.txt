# PREPARING TO FILL IN A BLANK CHECK
## 
### 
The enigma of the 1920 political campaign was Harding's stand on
the League and America's foreign policy; the enigma of politics today
is whether or not the President will frankly assume a definite attitude
toward the role America is to play in world politics. Admittedly, (lard
ing has painted a suggestive picture which he declares represents his
j.-olicy, but which is susceptible of various interpretations. The Presi
dent is deceiving neither himself or the public. The Harding foreign
fro 1 icy is yet to be announced.
The two months which have elapsed since Harding assumed the
Presidential cnair have revealed certain significant tendencies. If the
period can be read correctly, Harding will not break with the historic
tradition of the Republican party by insisting upon America's isolation,
r'ither the logic of events has forced his hand or previously conceived
policy has impelled his course, for the Harding foreign policy points
I ward the recognition of America's dependency upon other nations.
The lofty moral strain marking Wilson's course is as yet absent.
•Rather, the new administration is recognizing that our full recovery
from the war is predicated upon a restoration of normal conditions in
Kurope. Witness the Vivani reception, the notes to (iermany and the
allies, and, most significant, the appointment of an unofficial represen
tative on the Reparations Commission. The resolution declaring a
separate peace with Germany is strangely lagging in Congress. The
trend of Harding's thought is evident. Forced by the selfish prompting
of America's necessity, the campaign utterances of the irreconcilables
are quietly being dropped into the wastcbasket. Whether the trend will
mature info a f til I acceptance of the stand of Hoover and the thirty-one
leaders who signed the famous campaign memorial is, to say the least,
doubtful.
Harding, the candidate, was the bone of contention over which the
irreconcilables and those favoring some form of a league quarreled for
|»osscssion. Harding, the President, is still the prize contended for by
the two camps. On November 2 the American people .signed a blank
cheek of official power and handed it to Harding. During the next few
mouths he will fill in that check and the nation will know the cost of
electing a President on a gamble.
