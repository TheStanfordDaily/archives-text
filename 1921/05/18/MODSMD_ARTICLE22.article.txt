Reading from left to right in a Los
Angeles paper, we find that a 19171
graduate, who is about to be married, j
was "one of the most popular of the j

We were under the impression that
; the intramural track meet was start-;
ed to uncover Varsity material. How
ever, after a review of the situation,,
we are inclined to believe that it was

| jumps and first place in a twelve sec-1
; end heat in the hundred, tend to prove

We may expect to learn tomorrow
how some local celebrities stack up
in the home town. Something in the ;
; nature of foreign local color. Like the

The I'ress gang must expect to win
that D. l\ A. base ball contest by
. something other than science. Any
way. all their practice is confined to
self-education in the gentle art of
liorse-shoe throwing. Just, so they

We noticed a head yesterday which
read "Intramural Track Includes i

contest.
