A Spark o' Nature's Fire
Barrie at his whimsical, fanciful
best, admirably transferred to the
screen, is seen in "What Every Wo
man Knows," down at the Varsity.
This picture tells the story of a plain
little wife who makes her husband the
Success he is. while letting him think
—man-like —that he did it all him
self. There isn't much rough and
tumble ACTION to the thing but its
graceful humor and exquisite human
touches will bring an approving smile
to the face of anyone.
William P.. the younger of the l)e-
Mille brothers, directed it and caught
the spirit of the thing wonderfully
well. He deserves all the more credit
when you consider what a bold com
bination of Mack Sennett, Theda Bara,
and a three-ring circus, that big
brother Cecil B. achieved when he
manhandled Barrie's "The Admirable
Crichton" and made of it that lurid
spectacle, "Male and Female."
Send Me Away With a Smile
If you want to avoid the rush and
worry of getting out of Pally on the
very first train, stay over this year
and see the Senior Farce. It will give
you another day in which to pack the
trunk and let you leave the Farm with
a smile on your face.
All of which is occasioned by the
fact that the committee has announced
an unusually clever play for this year's
Farce. The play in question is Booth
Tarkington's "Clarence," and witli a
cast headed by Florence Pixley and
Paul Claflin to interpret it, the show
ought to be good.
How Are the Mighty Fallen
There is a touch of pathos in the
announcement from New York that
Eva Tanguay has been booked over
the Pantages circut. She, who once
boasted of being the highest salaried
star on Broadway is now reduced to
a string of third rate vaudeville
houses.
It is hard to imagine the flashing
Eva —she of the vivid tights, the giddy
coiffure, and the "1 don't care"—
gracing the hoard at Frovo, Utah. Put
one must eat to live, and beauty and
fame are fleeting things at beat.
