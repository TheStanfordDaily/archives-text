# French Class Has Social Gathering In Early Morning
## 
### 
Mr. Schwartz's 8 o'clock French con
versation class this morning held a mock
reception, in order to gain experience in
the polite phrases and usages employed
in France on such an occasion. The
hostess at the affair was Dorothy Her
rington, 23, and with her on the receiv
ing line were Elizabeth Lane, '21, and
Warren Lewis, '22.
Entertainment was varied. It included
a reading, several song selections, some
with ukelele accompaniment, and two
oral recitations. As a grand finale to
the morning's amusement came the re
freshments, to make up for the break
fasts sacrificed in favor of attendance at
this special event. Lemonade, cakes, and
candy were offered.
1 he little farce was entirely in keep
ing with the work which the class has
been doing all quarter. Their efforts to
gain fluency in French conversation have
licwi carried on through the informal
production of clever one and two act
comedies, the presentation of brief
speeches on topics of current interest,
and the playing of popular native games.
