# WORK ON NEW BASKETBALL PAVILION IS BEGUN TODAY
## 
### 
Actual work on the construction of
Stanford's new $90,000 basketball pa
vilion began this morning with the
breaking of ground for foundations. The
contract has been let to George Wagner
of San Francisco, who is building the
new Union, and the Nurses' Home. The
architects are Rake well & Brown, also of
San Francisco, who planned the library
and several other buildings on the
campus.
A change has been made in the loca
tion of the new pavilion, which will be
completed within three months. It will
be north of Encina Hall, facing the road
which leads past the Quad, east and west,
occupying the site of the three tennis
courts nearest the Hall. This location
was decided upon in order to leave as
much space as possible available for the
future extension of the present gym
nasium building. The locker and
shower rooms have been outgrown and
hallways are now fdled with lockers. It
is likely that in the future a new and
larger swimming pool will be desirable,
which can be placed in the court behind
the gymnasium. This open spacc will
include the three tennis courts now
nearest the gymnasium, and handball
courts will be placed back of the new
building. It is ultimately planned to
surround the entire spacc with a wall
with red-tiled coping, making another
Quad of the athletic buildings.
The new building will be of brick with

roofs of red tile, corresponding in archi
tecture with the present gymnasium. It
will be lighted by large windows at the
ends similar to those in the Library
building. There will be an open, truss**,
work ceiling supported by four steel
columns which will not interfere with
the playing floor.
The main floor is to be 112 feet by 152
feet, allowing space for three practice
basketball courts. There will be pro
vision made in laying the foundation for
the addition of galleries in the future.
Several appurteuances will make the
pavilion available for social purposes.
There will be, besides the entrance lobby,
coat rooms, smoking rooms and women's
rest rooms. There will be a spacious
room with three wide arches for chap
crones, and a small service kitchen for
dinners.
The floor will be of maple with a spe
cial spring construction. Seats will be
temporary and can be removed for
dances.
The basketball pavilion is significant
in that it is the first building to be
financed voluntarily by students. Last
fall* the student body voted to assess
themselves one dollar apiece for each
quarter until the addition was paid for.
In addition to this, the Board of Athletic
Control has granted $7500, and President
Wilbur and Comptroller Roth each have
given $2500 from ftieir annual budgets,
leaving $77,500 <fo be paid by the stu
dents.
