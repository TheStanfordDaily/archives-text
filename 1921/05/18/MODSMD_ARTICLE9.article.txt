## 
### Dorothy Hoskins, '22 
"A university is a natural focal for
presenting artistic achievement in
any form to the public," said Maude
Fay, looking out from the windows of
her San Francisco drawing-room at
the gathering fog yesterday afternoon.
"If Stanford University lives up to
the promise of this production of
'Faust,' her succeeding Music Festi
vals, it will take the lead on the
Pacific Coast of the type of musical
achievements which in the eastern
universities began in just this way—
the concert performance of a great
opera, which has been followed by an
increased demand for opera stage pre
sentation.
" 'Faust' I find to be unexpectedly
well adapted to concert production.
Vhe gripping drama of the story is
inherent and alive in the music itself,
and from our rehearsal work 1 am
recognizing for the first time that the
story of Marguerite, from naive youth
fulness to the power and passion of
the climax, breathes through the very
music itself."
Credited in London in 1914 with be
ing "the finest "Elsa" London has
ever heard," Miss Fay none the less
has a particularly affection for "Mar
guerite," since it was in this role that
she made her debut at the Royal Opera
in Munich. She expressed an interest
ing preference for the difficult role
of "Schertzerade" In the Niebelungen
lied as being, if successfully interpret
ed, the moßt triumphant of all possible
roles for a singer.
Since returning to America, Miss
Fay has appeared with the Metropoli
tan Opera Company in New York, and
has been soloist with leading sym
phony orchestras both in the east and
in the west.
