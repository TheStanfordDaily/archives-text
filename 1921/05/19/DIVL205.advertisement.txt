Ship and Sail under the Stars
and Stripes to all parts
of the world
YOU can now travel, or ship your goods, to
any part of the world on American owned
and American operated ships, flying the
American Flag. American ships are modern,
scientifically designed and constructed, new
ships built for satisfactory service.
American ships will carry you in comfort to
South America, England, Europe, the Mediter
ranean and the Far East. And the further from
home you go, the more of a thrill to
see the Stars and Stripes floating above your
head.
President Harding says:
"We know full well we cannot sell where we
do not buy and we cannot sell successfully
where we do not carry!'
