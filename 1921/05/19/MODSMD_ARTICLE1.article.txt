# CARD TRACK MEN READY TO LEAVE ON EASTERN TRIP
## Captain Kirksey Expected to Annex Both Dash Events in Harvard Big Meet, May 28 
### 
Led by Coach "Dink" Templeton,
Stanford's four-man track team com
posed of Captain Morris Kirksey, Jess
Wells, Lane balk and- Bob Williams,
leaves tomorrow morning to compete in
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Harvard
a week from Saturday.

The men will leave San Francisco at
9:40 and are due to arrive at Boston
Tuesday nifiht. This will give Temple
ton's men two days before the trials in
which to get into first-class shape after
the long trip across the continent.

Captain Kirksey is expected to he one
of the big point pinners of the meet,
provided his injured leg holds up under
the strain of the trial dashes and the
finals. Last year, in the same meet at
Philadelphia, the Cardinal flyer, after
winning his heat of the hundred in the
fastest time of the day, suffered a torn
ligament and was out of the finals. De
spite Kirksey's injuries, "Dink" Temple
ton and Jess Wells between them an
nexed fifteen points, which put Stanford
in sixth place.

In tteis year's meet, the Cardinal cap
tain should have only one man to fear
in the East. Allen Woodring of Syra
cuse University has been reeling off
some fast marks during the season and
will make Kirksey extend himself to
take the tape. Woodring is the man
who beat Charley Paddock in the 200-
meter event at the Olympic games.

Wells, who is the present I. C. A. A-
A. A. champion low hurdler by virtue of
his win in the event last year in the fast
time of 23:4, has never been in tip-top
shape this year and it is doubtful if he
ran repeat his last season victory. At
that, both he and Lane Falk, wiio iias
been finishing close to Wells all year,
have a good chance of placing.

Rob Williams may break into the point
winning column in the high sticks, l'irst
place ,in the high harriers is granted
to Earl Thompson of Dartmouth, thÂ®
world's record holder.
The Stanford athletes will only com
pete in the 011c meet while in tin- East,
returning to the campus in time for final
examinations.
