# STANFORD TENNIS TEAM OPENS TOUR IN NORTH MONDAY
## First Game on Extensive Trip Will be Played in Seattle May 23; Five Men go East 
### 
Cn Monday, May 23, at the Univer
sity of Washington, the Stanford ten
uis team will play the first match
scheduled on one of the mopt extensive
trips ever taken by a western racquet
team. The trip, beginning with the
first bout at Seattle, will bring the
Cardinal players against the best uni
versity tennis teams of the middle
western and far eastern states, end
ing with the National Intercollegiate
championships at the Merion Cricket
Club of Haverford, Pa., on June 28.

The trip thus far includes, however,
only the intercollegiate matches and
from June -28 until the Invitational
Tourney at the South Shore Country
Club of Chicago, the Stanford men
will enter all open national tourna
ments, including the sectional cham
pionship tourneys and the annual For
rest Hills National open doubles and
singles championship on August 29.

Only two men will make the east
ern trip, the team being composed of
Captain Phil Neer and Jimmy Davies.
This combination will be entered in
every tourney in the doubles play
while each man will be seen in the
singles tournament throughout the
summer. The matches played against
the intercollegiate teams of the middle
west and the east will probably in
clude three bouts and will consist of
two singles matches and one doubles,
the meet going to the team taking
the majority of the matches in each
play.
In the intercollegiate dual matches,
the Stanford players have a stiff
schedule to play and in some cases
parts of Jhe day will have to be spent
iii UhxWazt while thÂ» remainder will
be up with the playing of the
schedule. The trip has been extensive
ly advertised in the East and Manager
Ed Martin has received more requests
for meets from University teams than
could be granted. In the middle west,
the University of Indiana has always
had a top notch racquet squad and
should give the Cardinal a close match
when they meet at Bloomington, on
June S. In the far east, Yale is looked
to as the strongest opponent to face
the Stanford pair although Amherst
and Dartmouth have teams which rank
among the best.
