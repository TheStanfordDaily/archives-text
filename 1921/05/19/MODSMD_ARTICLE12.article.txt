# CHESTER H. ROWELL SAYS WORLD NEEDS THINKING IDEALISTS
## Noted Journalist Voices Hope In Light- Heartedness of Youth And Educational Training 
### 
"The world is calling for the idealism and courage of youth, tempered
hy the discipline of education." This was the message which Chester Har
vey Rowell, introduced by President Wilbur as "California's foremost go(*i
citizen," brought to the Stanford community at an assembly this morning,
"Without the right of progress of thought and investigation, no otheT pro
gress is worth anything," said Rowell in'discussing the reaction which had
followed the war. "We may fight for the liberty of investigation against
any authority. It is the central liberty of all liberties," Political conserva
tism and an attempt at "better Americanism" are two of the outgrowths of
this reaction, and, according to the speaker, are based mostly ou stupidity,
intolerance and coercion.

"The sort of Americanism which by
main strength makes immigrants copy
our faults and limitations:," he con
tinued, "and which makes them asham
ed of the things which they brought
here to enrich America—that sort of
Americanism can justly be resented.
It is no longer American. Our first
task is to Americanize the Americans
and Christianize the Christians."

For those who have not the courage
to thing things through, the statesman
journalist recommends the reaction
ary psycholcigy as the easiest. "The
radical mind is just the opposite." he
added. "It. takes nothing as settled,
this intellectual anarchy challenges
everything. The trouble with
of our half-baked anarchists is that
they ask all question and find no an
swer to any. Radicalism is stimulat
ing to the man who really has the
courage to think it through "

In his introduction Mr. Rowpll ?«poke
of the light-heartedness and "joke at
titude" of youth. "If youth wasn't
carefree and reckless, the world would
oot have the courage to go ahead.
Why worry about whether life is
worth living. Life is not a riddle —-
it is a job. Each man's job is do his
own, realizing that both he and bis
job are rather insignificant in the
workings of the Universe."
Mr. Howell cleaimed that it Occi
dental civilization was to survive under
any leadership, it would be under the
enlightenment of idealism of youth and
education.
The Assembly Hall was filled wilh
students, members of the faculty and
Palo Altans. This noon Mr. Howell
spoke at a luncheon given by the
Political Science Club of Palo Alto.
This evening he will be the guest of
the Stanford Chapter of the American
Journalists' Association, for an in
formal dinner, at the home of Pto
fessor Everett W. Smith, 12 Alvarado
Row, at which he will talk on some
phase of journalism.
