# NEAR EAST RELIEF IS SUBJECT OF LECTURE

### 
"There are no overhead expense? in
the Near East Relief," said Mabel
Farrington, of the Relief .Committee,
when speaking of the work which is
being done by the Relief in Armenia
and the Asia Minor countries, at tho
various living groups on the campus
yesterday. "They are met by such
philanthropists as Cleveland H. Dodge
and all of the money subscribed by
the American public goes directly 1o
the field and is used where it is mott
needed."
Miss Farrington outlined the work
which the Relief is doing in edutating
the children in industries so that they
will be able to help care for them
selves. They are instructed in spin
ning and carding wool, and in mak-
ing it into cloth, and then into cloth
ing. Whereever possible, blacksmith
and tin shops are operated, and the
boys are instructed in making furni
ture and utensils. In one of the or
phanages in which Miss Farrington
was located for a time, all of the table
utensils had been constructed by the
children.
"They are all anxious to learn," said
Miss Farrington, "and it is really a
pitiful sight to see how eagerly these
children hang on the words of a teach
er as she reads from the only text
book available in the orpranage."
Miss Farrington is making her ap
j peal to the college people personally
; because a large number of the colleges
in the United States are represented i
iby workers in the field. There are
i 538 American men and women who are
! administering relief in the Near East
countries. They are often in peril of
| death from war and disease, but they
' see the vital importance of the work
j which is being done for the children
! there and urge the continuance of aid
until a responsible government can I
take over the care of the children.
"The name America is respected by i
the Turks and Bolshevists and at no j
time have our workers been molested i
by their forces. The American sup-:
plies and hospitals have been left in-;
| tact during all their ravages through-j
! out the country."
"The service of the workers in the |
I Near Fast Relief is for the most part j
voluntary and the great appeal that !
S we are now making to the American â€¢
| colleges is that they become our part
| ners in this work of caring for starv
; ing children by contributing to the
relief fund in some way, no matter
| how small."
