## 
### 
Reservations for the Senior Ball go
on sale tomorrow afternoon at the book
store at 1 o'clock. This is the first,
last, anil only chance to avail oneself
of entrance to the ball, because the
limited number, 100. will be sold to peo
ple as they are applied for without any
■preference, except for the fact that
seniors and holdovers will have tirst call
on the reservations. If there should be
any left after the sale they may be placed
in the hands of the other classes. The
reservations are to be made for couples
and will sell for $11 per couple. This
not only includes the ball but the supper
before and the midnight lunch which will
be served.
An interesting feature has been at
tempted by the committee this year witli
the adoption of individual tables for dif
ferent sized tables to accommodate not
only couples but parties of different
sizes that wish to get together for the
•evening. By signing up at the bookstore
first if several go at once and arrange
for their party to be all at one table
they will be able to keep the group in
tact for the evening. The way the seat
ing has been arranged is as follows:
There will be 25 tables of 4 each, 1(3
tables of 6 each, and 8 that will accom
modate 8 people. Not all of these will
he for subscription tomorrow, -but the
greater part are open. In this manner
parties of two. three, or four couples
will find it easy to arrange their groups
for the evening's dancing.
It is the wish of the committee that
seniors going to the ball make their
reservations at once so as to obviate*iny
chance of tickets not getting to them
and to some other class, due to misun
derstanding, because they have the first
call tin the reservations. The sale is not
expected to last later than tomorrow
afternoon, so it will probably pay to get
around early and arrange for the seating.
