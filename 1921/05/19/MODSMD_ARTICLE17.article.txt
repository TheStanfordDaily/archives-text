' Aristocratic trustees and democratic legislatures occasionally seek
Jo limit freedom of thought by prescribing what particular brand of po
litical doctrine may Ik* taught in universities," commented Chester Row
ell this, morning at the Assembly. The examples cited by Mr. kowell of
attempted crippling of that free thought which makes progress possible
were obviously flagrant and easily drew the disapproval of his audience.
Vet no truism is so openly violated or so constantly disregarded at Stan
ford today as the bromodial statement that to every student should be
given (he right to develop his personal beliefs and hew out the niche he
wishes to occupy in campus life.
Socially, every student feels the pressure to conform to certain pre
conceived standards. The mold of social convention awaits the entering
student and to this mold be must conform to avoid the criticism which
at its best is merely unfriendly comment and at its worst is ostracism.
Politically, free and independent thinking on student body affairs is con
fined to relatively few. The small number voting at student election
reveals a mental laziness which mildly wonders what the leaders are "now
putting across." Admittedly, it is a self-imposed imprisonment, but lie
cause of that very fact it is all the more dangerous to the healthy func
tioning of student politics.
Scholastically, the student must of necessity follow the direction of
1 «is professor in class work. The term "direction of his professor" is sig
nificant. Interpreted as leadership it inspires the student to initiative
and leads to independent research. Interpreted as the order of a drill
master which must be unthinkingly obeyed, the student mentally goose
steps with the crowd. To him the stimulus of independent thinking
"verboten" as'much as freedom of action is to the German soldier.
"If you haven't the courage to think things through." asserted Mr.
Kowell, "the easiest way is to adopt the opinions of others." In that
sentence the sjKsaker of the morning emphasized a phase of Stanford
spirit which is much overlooked in these flays of Mercers and bandoline.
Jf the initial years at Stanford were the "golden days'" they were so
becauseof the mental and moral courage of students in marking out their
beliefs and standards not in blind conformity to group pressure but with
self-respecting and independent thinkiifg. Of course, the old days are
always the Golden Days for any institution! But in the resumption of
tlie attitude of mental courage which characterized the early period, and
which Mr. Kowell declared to be a vital need, the present student bod)'
would follow the best of a period which has made the name Stanford
famous.
The career of Chester Kowell himself i> a pertinent example of a man
mentally and morally courageous in business and civic life. The national
reputation of Stanford's visitor today is probably due to one trait of his
personality more than anything else, a flaunting disregard of orders of
the politically higher-up and an insistence upon expressing his opinions
when the need arises for action.

becauseof the mental and moral courage of students in marking out their
beliefs and standards not in blind conformity to group pressure but with
self-respecting and independent thinkiifg. Of course, the old days are
always the Golden Days for any institution! But in the resumption of
tlie attitude of mental courage which characterized the early period, and
which Mr. Kowell declared to be a vital need, the present student bod)'
would follow the best of a period which has made the name Stanford
famous.
The career of Chester Kowell himself i> a pertinent example of a man
mentally and morally courageous in business and civic life. The national
reputation of Stanford's visitor today is probably due to one trait of his
personality more than anything else, a flaunting disregard of orders of
the politically higher-up and an insistence upon expressing his opinions
when the need arises for action.
' Aristocratic trustees and democratic legislatures occasionally seek
Jo limit freedom of thought by prescribing what particular brand of po
litical doctrine may Ik* taught in universities," commented Chester Row
ell this, morning at the Assembly. The examples cited by Mr. kowell of
attempted crippling of that free thought which makes progress possible
were obviously flagrant and easily drew the disapproval of his audience.
Vet no truism is so openly violated or so constantly disregarded at Stan
ford today as the bromodial statement that to every student should be
given (he right to develop his personal beliefs and hew out the niche he
wishes to occupy in campus life.
Socially, every student feels the pressure to conform to certain pre
conceived standards. The mold of social convention awaits the entering
student and to this mold be must conform to avoid the criticism which
at its best is merely unfriendly comment and at its worst is ostracism.
Politically, free and independent thinking on student body affairs is con
fined to relatively few. The small number voting at student election
reveals a mental laziness which mildly wonders what the leaders are "now
putting across." Admittedly, it is a self-imposed imprisonment, but lie
cause of that very fact it is all the more dangerous to the healthy func
tioning of student politics.
Scholastically, the student must of necessity follow the direction of
1 «is professor in class work. The term "direction of his professor" is sig
nificant. Interpreted as leadership it inspires the student to initiative
and leads to independent research. Interpreted as the order of a drill
master which must be unthinkingly obeyed, the student mentally goose
steps with the crowd. To him the stimulus of independent thinking
"verboten" as'much as freedom of action is to the German soldier.
"If you haven't the courage to think things through." asserted Mr.
Kowell, "the easiest way is to adopt the opinions of others." In that
sentence the sjKsaker of the morning emphasized a phase of Stanford
spirit which is much overlooked in these flays of Mercers and bandoline.
Jf the initial years at Stanford were the "golden days'" they were so
becauseof the mental and moral courage of students in marking out their
beliefs and standards not in blind conformity to group pressure but with
self-respecting and independent thinkiifg. Of course, the old days are
always the Golden Days for any institution! But in the resumption of
tlie attitude of mental courage which characterized the early period, and
which Mr. Kowell declared to be a vital need, the present student bod)'
