In accordance with advance publi
-1 city, we take pleasure in introducing
|to you a thrilling excerpt from a
'"home-town newspaper." No. Mchi
' table, home was ever like this.
It begins as follows: "Floyd has
been awarded a Harvard University
scholarship in a competitive examin
ation . . . Ever since he entered Stan
ford, he has led his class and has been
! honored by being elected to fill vari
ous important positions by the stu
dent body of the institution."
"This year he has been President
of the Associated Students, the highest
honor they can confer, and this has
I taken a great deal of his time, never
theless he has kept up in all of his
| studies and now leads his class and
gets a scholarship in a severe com
petitive examination."
POOR FELLER!
I "Floyd has worked his way through
I
j the university without, very much as
sistance from his parents (not very
much) —for he wanted to—and when
he came to Willits for his summer
vacations, he worked in the HAY
FIELDS, PLANING MILL, and did
OTHER HARD MANUAL LABOR!"
PAGE THE D.S.M.
"During the war, he was in charge
of a military hospital in Los Angeles
when the whole community was af
i flicted with the flu and doctors and
nurses could not be obtained in suf
ficient numbers to handle the epidemic
... At rtne time he was able to ob
tain only labours of sleep in a whole
week (Gosh!) and for this service
be received the highest commendation
from the regular U. S. Army officers
(real guys, eh?) and at that time HE
WAS STILL A MINOR."
BEAUCOUP DES COGNOMENS
j "All of Floyd's Willits friends know
I that he is going to make good at
Harvard University also. PERSEVER
'ANCE and INDUSTRY are his other
' names." (We thought his initials
j were F. L.).
NOT THE ONLY GREAT ONE
"Secretary Herbert Hoover, one of
the few greatest men in the whole
world, is ALSO a graduate of Stan
ford . . . and when the time comes,
we fully believe that with Floyd's own
ability and the influence of . , . that
he will fill a station in life (gas filling
station) that will be on the top round
of achievement."

It is of interest to note that the
new beanery on the campus is to be
built by Bakewell and Brown. That's
some improvement over the Inn. Most
of their stuff is baked either rare or
black.

In accordance with advance publi
-1 city, we take pleasure in introducing
|to you a thrilling excerpt from a
'"home-town newspaper." No. Mchi
' table, home was ever like this.
It begins as follows: "Floyd has
been awarded a Harvard University
scholarship in a competitive examin
ation . . . Ever since he entered Stan
ford, he has led his class and has been
! honored by being elected to fill vari
ous important positions by the stu
dent body of the institution."
"This year he has been President
of the Associated Students, the highest
honor they can confer, and this has
I taken a great deal of his time, never
theless he has kept up in all of his
| studies and now leads his class and
gets a scholarship in a severe com
petitive examination."
POOR FELLER!
I "Floyd has worked his way through
I
j the university without, very much as
sistance from his parents (not very
much) —for he wanted to—and when
he came to Willits for his summer
vacations, he worked in the HAY
FIELDS, PLANING MILL, and did
OTHER HARD MANUAL LABOR!"
PAGE THE D.S.M.
"During the war, he was in charge
of a military hospital in Los Angeles
when the whole community was af
i flicted with the flu and doctors and
nurses could not be obtained in suf
ficient numbers to handle the epidemic
... At rtne time he was able to ob
tain only labours of sleep in a whole
week (Gosh!) and for this service
be received the highest commendation
from the regular U. S. Army officers
(real guys, eh?) and at that time HE
WAS STILL A MINOR."
BEAUCOUP DES COGNOMENS
j "All of Floyd's Willits friends know
I that he is going to make good at
Harvard University also. PERSEVER
'ANCE and INDUSTRY are his other
' names." (We thought his initials
j were F. L.).
NOT THE ONLY GREAT ONE
"Secretary Herbert Hoover, one of
the few greatest men in the whole
world, is ALSO a graduate of Stan
ford . . . and when the time comes,
we fully believe that with Floyd's own
ability and the influence of . , . that
he will fill a station in life (gas filling
station) that will be on the top round
of achievement."
