# Trophies Awarded For Soccer Championship
## 
### 
Two kinds of trophies have been
presented to the varsity soccer play
ers, individually and as a team, as a
result of the championship won last
quarter in the University and Club
Soccer League.
Individual medals for every varsity
soccer player on this year's team have
been donated by the Executive Com
mittee of the California Soccer Asso
ciation. These medals are of silver,
i and have engraved on them an action
picture of a soccer player.
Many of the medals have been distri
buted, and those who have not yet
received theirs may do so by applying
at the office of Coach Maloney in the
gymnasium.
A handsome silver cup has been
donated to the team by the Italian
Club of San Francisco, in recogni
tion of the winning of the league
championship. It will be the perma
nent possession of the team, not pass
ing from one winner to another.
The cframpionsh'p of the University
and Club Soccer league was won last
quarter, after a long hard season, the
deciding game being with the Olympic
soccerites, and the playing of Stan
ford's team showed it to be the best
turned out for four or five years.
From present indications, chances
for winning the same championship
next year are good, if some new ma
terial that is needed is unearthed.
There has been some practice during
this quarter, but the real grind will
start promptly with the opening of the
fall quarter next October.
