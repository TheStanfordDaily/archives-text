# Humorous Chappie Will Appear Tomorrow With Cover of Ironic Azure
## 
### 
Humor, humorists and tlTe usual rin
of jokes, to say nothing of paradoxes,
feature the Chappie which is to be put
on sale tomorrow. That's all start
ling, wot? Really going on sale, and
guaranteed to be actually funny? It
may not be so, though, because the
editor's told us both things so many
times before â€”but.to some to come
back to that paradox. It's about the
cover Fred Fisher, '24, drew. It's
blue. It may be that it was printed
that color to give tho contributors
something to overcome, and they cer
tainly did. \ i
