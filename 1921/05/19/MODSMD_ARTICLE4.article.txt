# EX COMMITTEE APPROVES OF ALTERATIONS IN DAILY PALO ALTO ORGANIZATION
## Constitution Will Be Voted On At Quad Election Next Thursday 
### 
An acceptance of the combined reports
ami recommendations of the Daily Palo
Alto investigating committee and the
editor of the student body publication,
with reservations and amendments, re
sulted from a special meeting of the
executive committee held last night. The
investigating committee, comprising Neil
Allen, '18/ chairman, R. E. Wedekind,
'19, D. W. Evans, '20, Charles Arnn, '21,
Don Purdy, '20, and Professor E. W.
Smith, appointed by" F. L. McElroy, stu
dent body president, last December to
investigate the causes for the financial
crisis of the last administration and to
formulate plans by which the financial
future of the Daily Palo Alto would be
assure d, presented recommendations
which were accepted in part. Recom
mendations referring to the editorial or
ganization of the publication embodying
the present system, with minor changes,
presented to the committee by W. F.
Leiser, '21, present editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, were incorporated into the
plan offered by the investigating com
mittee.
The plans, as amended by the execu
tive committee, will be presented for
student body vote at a special election
to be held Thursday, May 26.
The chief recommendation embodied
in the proposed amendment to the con
stitution provides for the appointment
of an advisory committee, whose duty it
shall be to work in co-operation with
the Daily Palo Alto editorial and man
agerial staffs and the executive commit
tee, Only advisory and recommending
powers are delegated to the body. The
committee may examine the books of the
Daily Palo Alto at any time and will
keep in touch with the management of
the editorial #taff. The proposed body
will be fomapsed of students with news
paper experience who have not been con
nected with the Daily Palo Alto for at
least three months prior to their appoint
ment.
According to the investigating com
mittee's report, one of the chief reasons
for financial disaster in the past has been
the lack of co-ordination between the
members of the staff and between the
executive committee and the editorial
•and managerial staffs, as a whole. The

advisory committee, being in an un
prejudiced position, would be able to

correct many difficulties arising in both
departments without actual interference
with their operation.

Preferential voting, such as is now in
practice in Daily Palo Alto staff elec
tions, has been reduced to a minimum in
the proposed amendment and gives pref
erence by seniority rather than by staff
rating. The present system provides for
a range of votes from one. to five, where
as the proposed change would reduce the
range from one to two and one-half
votes.
The system of business management
used by the present ,director was adopted
with slight changes. The investigating
committee reported the Daily Palo Alto
to be operating under the lowest possible
cost estimated by the University Press,
which allows a small margin of profit.
A report of the findings of the investi
gating committee is £iven below. Tile
recommendations as adopted by the ex
ecutive committee are published in a
separate article as an amendment, in ac
cordance with the student body constitu
tion.
