# REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE:
## 
### 
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

Revision of Sec. 5 of Article 2, Regu
lar Constitution:
Sec. 5. The Executive Committee
shall elect a Business Manager of '1 he
Daily Palo Alto during the first week in
lime, with duties and powers hereinafter
provided, and, when advisable, one or
two assistants to the Business Manager
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

Revision of Sec. 5 of Article 2, Regu
lar Constitution:
Sec. 5. The Executive Committee
shall elect a Business Manager of '1 he
Daily Palo Alto during the first week in
lime, with duties and powers hereinafter
provided, and, when advisable, one or
two assistants to the Business Manager
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

Revision of Sec. 5 of Article 2, Regu
lar Constitution:
Sec. 5. The Executive Committee
shall elect a Business Manager of '1 he
Daily Palo Alto during the first week in
lime, with duties and powers hereinafter
provided, and, when advisable, one or
two assistants to the Business Manager
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

Revision of Sec. 5 of Article 2, Regu
lar Constitution:
Sec. 5. The Executive Committee
shall elect a Business Manager of '1 he
Daily Palo Alto during the first week in
lime, with duties and powers hereinafter
provided, and, when advisable, one or
two assistants to the Business Manager
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

Revision of Sec. 5 of Article 2, Regu
lar Constitution:
Sec. 5. The Executive Committee
shall elect a Business Manager of '1 he
Daily Palo Alto during the first week in
lime, with duties and powers hereinafter
provided, and, when advisable, one or
two assistants to the Business Manager
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went

committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now

those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of

Revision of Sec. 5 of Article 2, Regu
lar Constitution:
Sec. 5. The Executive Committee
shall elect a Business Manager of '1 he
Daily Palo Alto during the first week in
lime, with duties and powers hereinafter
provided, and, when advisable, one or
two assistants to the Business Manager
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.

Revision of Sec. 5 of Article 2, Regu
lar Constitution:
Sec. 5. The Executive Committee
shall elect a Business Manager of '1 he
Daily Palo Alto during the first week in
lime, with duties and powers hereinafter
provided, and, when advisable, one or
two assistants to the Business Manager
In accordancc with authority of Pres
ident of the Associated Students, Floyd
L. McElroy, this committee" as under
signed, began on December 24, 1920. an
investigation of the financial crisis of the
Daly Palo Alto, for the purpose of ascer
taining causes of said crisis and formu
lating plans by which the future financial
conditions of the Daly Palo Alto would
be assured.
The committee has met fifteen times,
has made a thorough study of the situa
tion, and feels that the recommendations
embodied hereinafter will effect the de
sired purpose and are justified by the
circumstances. The study this commit
tee has made has included an examina
tion of printing costs; 2, ah examination
of income and expenditures by the man
agement of the Daily Palo Alto; 3, an
examination of the efficiency of organi
zation of tlie managerial department of
Daily Palo Alto; 4, a consideration of
efficiency of organization of the editorial
department in so far as connected with
the financial phase; 5, a study of the
present constitutional provisions cover
ing the operation of tlie Daily Palo Alto;
o, and a thorough comparative study of
business conditions in the future.
The particular problem before the
committee, that expenses so far exceeded
revenues during the fall quarter, as to
leave a .deficit at Christmas time, has
been settled in general to the following
conclusions: that revenues could not lie
so materially increased as to cover the
difference, but that cost of operation on
the other hand could be, and since has
been, so materially decreased that under
the present cost of operation, revenue
will exceed expenditure. -The committee
deems the present constitutional pro
visions for the Daily Palo Alto too loose
and inadequate to insure the desired ef
ficiency <>r to maintain the present basis
of solvency. In pursuance of the con
clusions to which it has thus arrived the
committee therefore recommends that
the constitutional revisions hereinafter
set forth be given consideration, and be
■substituted in the constitution of the As
sociated Students for the present sec- *
Hons relating to the Daily Palo Alto. fj
•irst—l he committee first held a con- S
mi tat ion with the management of the p
1 n,vcrsil >' Press and examined printing n
cost.-, the Daily Palo Alto as shown on E
the books of the University Press. This C
jconsultation revealed a wi t l, scale of S
I fluctuation in printing costs, due largely
to varying degrees of efficiency and in
! effi «ency from both managerial and edi- I
| tonal departments. It was shown con
clusively that maximum of efficiency
j from both those departments could bring
| printing costs on the present six-column
sheet within the revenue available. The
j I diversity P/ess. on request by the com
mittee, prepared a schedule of minimum
| costs which were reasonably designed to
be within reach of the Daily Palo Alto
,l».\ efficient operation. Second—Since'
Christmas time, when the finance prob- j
j lem of the paper was acute, organization |
jof the paper has been so satisfactorily!
j worked out by those in charge of the re- >
j speetive departments that the submitted
I schedule has been approximated and ex !
penses have been brought within the in
j come. In this connection the business :
| manager of the Daily Palo Alto worked i
|in close co-operation with the commit- •
'tee, and the committee has in large part
j adopted the system worked out and ap
| plied by him. to the end that the essen
tial condition of solvent operation may
jbe continued. This system, as set out in
the detailed by-laws accompanying, in
; sures taking every advantage from a
, standpoint of increasing income, of ex
'! pected improvements in the general out
: i side business situation.
It was quickly determined from the j
, showing of the cost accounts kept by
: the University I'ress, that efficient or in
'efficient operation of the editorial de
! partment had a very direct bearing on
printing costs; and that only constant
! attention to a maximum of efficiency in
'getting out the paper can insure the low j
j rate of cost necessary to keep expenses |
; within income. Since a loose system in
i the editorial department can as effective
-1 j U bring about a recurrence of financial
crisis as inefficiency in management, the
'j committee, after detailed deliberation,
': lias worked out a revision of the present
'loose constitutional sections relating to
)editorial management. In this recom
mendation, the committee has endea- 1
jvored to make such changes as are cal
' eulated to effect and maintain the maxi
imuni of efficiency from the financial -ide.
From the very beginning, the commit
tee realized that no matter how strong
'|and worthy its recommendations proved |
[to be, they could not be enforced, even
lif adopted into the constitution, under
the present system. The lacking element,
the committee feels, is a direct connec
! tion between the Daily Palo Alto organi
; y.ation and the executive committee. With
| the constitution so revised that a prac
. jtical business working organization for
the paper was adopted into it, all the
I work of the committee would come to j
> i naught, if not the first year, soon there
after, at least, unless some method were
, devised whereby the Daily Palo Alto or
.jganization would be more closely linked
. I ,to the executive committee and the con
t stitutional organization for the Daily
. strictly enforced. The plan which the
. committee has concluded as the best for
. i meeting this problem is that of an ad
, j visory committee with purely advisory
, j powers, as its name suggests, over the
, entire Daily organization, managerial
; and editorial. This committee would at
the some time represent the executive
committee and the Daily. The plan as
resolved by the committee would, in de
, I tail, be as follows: The committee would
consist of three members. Two of these
. members would have a certain amount
of newspaper experience; the third
i' would, if possible, have some business
experience. The committee would be
selected.by the executive committee and
' each member holding office for three
quarters, the term of each being so ar
. ranged that not more than one man went
, out of office a{ one time. The powers of
the committee would consist of the right
: to see the hooks of the Daily Palo Alto
I at any time it desired; the right to make
suggestions to either the manager or
editor; the r to call to the attention
of either any non-observance of con
■ stitutional regulations; and it would be
the duty of such a committee to make
any recommendations it saw fit in regard
to the Daily Palo Alto. In short, the
committee would be a connecting link
between the Daily and the executive
committee, a connection which is now
lacking. This committee believes that
the advisory committee it suggests
would be more appropriate than any
other plan that could be developed.
Though the executive committee now
has powers over the Daily Palo Alto,
those powers are not exercised, and it is
a rare occurrence for a representative of
the Daily Palo Alto to appear before the
executive committee in connection with
anything concerning the Daily Palo Alto.
