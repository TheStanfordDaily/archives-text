# ENCINA WEST DOWNS CHI PSI 4-1 IN FAST WATER POLO GAME
## 
### 
As a, result of yesterday's intra
mural water polo contest, Encina
West is in the line for the semi-finals,
and Chi Psi is out of the race. The
Encina team scored a 4-1 victory over
their Row opponents, although the
game was not as one-sided as the score
might indicate. For the first half the
two water polo outfits battled evenly,
the score at half time being 1-1. Encina
West then showed a reserve strength
in the last half which Chi Psi lacked,
and soon pulled out of immediate
danger.
So far the Eating Clubs team and
Encina West are the only ones that
are in line for the semi-finals. Today's
contest between Sequoia and the Palo
Alto team determines which will have
a chance for the championship, and
tomorrow Encina West meets the two
fraternities in the fourth
game of this preliminary series.
Alpha Sigma Phi and El Capitan
play each other either this afternoon
or tomorrow. This contest should
prove to be"one of the best of the
whole series, as each outfit is com
posed of good swimmers and have
many mwi who are familiar with
water polo. Another contest sched
uled to give tho fans a good exhibition
will take place next Monday, when
Phi Delta Theta and Alpha Delta Phi
clash.
