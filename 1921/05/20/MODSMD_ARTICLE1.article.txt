# ROWELL SPEAKS ON EAST RELIEF WORK CAMPAIGN
## Hope of Extending Occidental Civilization Lies in Aid for Armenia, Says Journalist 
### Bertha Vaughan, '22 
"If the Occidental civilization is to be
extended in the countries of Asia Minor,
America must respond to the call for
temporary aid in those countries," said
Chester Rowell when interviewed last
night in regard to the work of the Near
East Relief, which is now conducting a
campaign fur funds on the campus.
"Armenia is the connecting link be
tween the oriental and occidental coun
tries, if we are to hope for a spread
of the latter, we must help to tide her
over this period of crisis which is a
direct result of the war. The Ar
menians, who are the oldest Christian
nation, have clung to their faith in the
face of death and threatened destruc
tion and have earned the Vight to our
protection."
Mr. Rowell pointed out that the mas
sacres and deportations of the Ar
menians, Greeks, and other subjects
of the Turkish Empire, although they
had some economical and political back
ground, occurred largely because of the
Mohammedan antipathy for all Chris
tians.
The Armenian problem exists because
of America, for without the aid which
America offered to that country the Ar
menians, as a race, would have disap
peared, and their territory would have
remained only to be placed in the hands
of Orientals, whose creed would then
spread into he Christian world. It is
because of the grave danger of such an
occurrence as well as the humane side
of the question that Mr. Rowell and
other exponents of the Near East Relief
are urging the support of the American
people in the present campaign
"The Armenians and Greeks who, for
the most part, make up the destitute pop
ulation of the Near East countries, were
the economic backbone of the former
Ottoman Empire, and the future of Asia
Minor now practically lies in whether
or not America will lend the aid which
will bring the people of these districts
through until they can establish a stable
form of government which will provide
for the starving."
Mr. Rowell's intense interest in world
affairs and his keen understanding of
the economic relationships of nations
give his statements the authority which
the American public has a right to de
mand in keeping up such a work and
should lend weight to the importance of
the campaign which is now being car
ried on.
