# FIRST RETURNS SHOW $768 FOR RELIEF FUND
## 
### 
Seven hundred and sixty-eight dollars
have so far been contributed to tbe Near
East Relief campaign by Stanford peo
ple. This sum represents only the par
tial returns, as results have only been
handed in from two of the sororities and
one fraternity, and only partly from
Sequoia and Encina.
The two sororities from which returns
arc complete have taken the way suj?
gestcd by the local committee and have
contributed $120 each for the adoption
of an orphan, a plan which was followed
by Roble Hall in the early part of the
campaign- If the response of these first
groups is continued by the othci living'
fironps it is the opinion of the committer
that Stanford will be placed on a pat
with other institutions of the country
which have so generously contributed to
the Relief.
Representatives of the committee will
be. in the Y. M. C. A. rooms in tlif.
Union all day tomorrow to receive tlv
'returns from the group representatives
and hope to make a full report of the
campaign by Monday.
