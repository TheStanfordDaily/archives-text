A new step in the history of Stanford activity is the Military Day
planned by Major Collins and his department tomorrow*. A casual
{•lance at the program announced will show that while it is a military
ceremony, it is in a larger way a public enterprise, a grouping of events
<»f general interest to which the University community is invited.
For the first time officers' commissions will be awarded to men who
have successfully completed the training courses. The women's -'equita
tion class is to take the field in demonstration of clever riding. The
races and competition in maneuvering of the fast caterpillar tractors
should furnish their share of thrills. Many critics rate the Oakland
Nigh School band, which is to be on hand all day, one of the best on the
Coast. A short polo match will be featured by some of the most widely
known players in the State.
Major Collins has this year broadened the scope and sphere of the
military corps and its place in the scheme of Stanford activity. No part
of the University has been conducted more in keeping with public spirit
and tlu*. Stanford spirit. The well-planned program set for tomorrow
afternoon will be the high mark of the military year, and the student
body will no doubt lend to its success the) same spirit and co-operation
ih'at Major Collins and his corps of men have throughout the year given
