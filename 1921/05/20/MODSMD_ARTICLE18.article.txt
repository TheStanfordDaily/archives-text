# THE
						SENIORS MUST GET TOGETHER
## 
### 
Announcement is made today of a number of senior men who have
undertaken to give their time to the securing of endowment insurance
policies. The committee in charge has obtained a very favorable policy
from a thoroughly satisfactory company as they were asked by the
senior class to do. They will soon be ready to present the plan individ
ually to the members of 1921.
In a short time every senior will be asked to do a very small part in
building this, the class' only memorial to the University. If the plan is
to be a success and to mean all that it ma)' to Stanford, the members of
the committee must meet with more than general indifference to the
undertaking. A majority ot the class voted in favor of continuing the
plan. Now a majority must come .through, voluntarily. <>r certain!)
without urging when approached. The committee members are not sales
men who must convince their buyers. They are appointed as class officers
to perform a duty entrusted by the class, and as such should receive the
help of all class members at least to the extent of a small pledge or
policy from each.
