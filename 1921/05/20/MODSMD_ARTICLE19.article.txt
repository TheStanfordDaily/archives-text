# THE 						BAND IS BUSY
## 
### 
Tomorrow at the Military Day program, a I niversity function, we
might naturally expect to find foremost among the Stanford organiza
tions contributing to the success of the. undertaking the Stanford hand.
We will he disappointed if we do, however, since the members of this
Stanford organization will he busy at various other affairs of their own
tnd therefore refuse to play. At first thought we are inclined to be just
a little chagrined at the great depth of spirit exhibited by this University
organization which finds it impossible to function on a regular Universi
ty day at an important University occasion, and which therefore makes ii
necessary to secure a prep school band to take the part of the Stanford
band on this Stanford program.
On second thought, perhaps we should extend a word of apprecia
tion. Our hand's refusal to plav makes it possible for us to hear one of
3.he best prep-school organizations in the countrv.
Furthermore we make thank the band for the opportunity of bring
ing to the campus a number of excellent high-school lads who may be
•come acquainted with the University, and who will at the program come
in contact with the Stanford spirit ; and since our band will not be there
to impart to them its idea of that spirit, the bovs should return to ()ak
land somewhat favorably impressed.

Tomorrow at the Military Day program, a I niversity function, we
might naturally expect to find foremost among the Stanford organiza
tions contributing to the success of the. undertaking the Stanford hand.
We will he disappointed if we do, however, since the members of this
Stanford organization will he busy at various other affairs of their own
tnd therefore refuse to play. At first thought we are inclined to be just
a little chagrined at the great depth of spirit exhibited by this University
organization which finds it impossible to function on a regular Universi

necessary to secure a prep school band to take the part of the Stanford
band on this Stanford program.
On second thought, perhaps we should extend a word of apprecia
tion. Our hand's refusal to plav makes it possible for us to hear one of
3.he best prep-school organizations in the countrv.
Furthermore we make thank the band for the opportunity of bring
ing to the campus a number of excellent high-school lads who may be
•come acquainted with the University, and who will at the program come
in contact with the Stanford spirit ; and since our band will not be there
to impart to them its idea of that spirit, the bovs should return to ()ak
land somewhat favorably impressed.
