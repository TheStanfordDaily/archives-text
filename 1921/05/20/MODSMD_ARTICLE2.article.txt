M. A. degree in 1912. Ordained to the
Congregational ministry in 1908, lie

Church at Falls River, Mass., succeed
ing as pastor in 1913. Along with his
duties in the Central Church in Boston
with which he has been cohnected
since 1914, Dr. Sperry has had many
outside interests in theological re
search, acting as associate professor
