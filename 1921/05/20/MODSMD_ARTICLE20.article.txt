Weep For Wifey
Some sweet day we are going to
walk into a movie show and see a pic
ture of happily married life and then
we ar6 going to drop dead. The shock
will be too great.
The latest compendium of material
unhappiness is contained in "Harriet
and the Piper," Anita Stewart's pic
ture down at the Stanford. It tells
of the girl and the familiar "initial
mistake," which isn't explained until
the very end and isn't half as bad as
you are led to believe. The little al
legorical thread regarding the piper
is cleverly worked out, some of the
scenes are very artistic and the pic
ture is seven reels in length.
No Spick Engliish
George Beban ,the screen
after an absence of many moons and
is appearing in "One Man in a Mil
lion." down at the Varsity. The star
plays the sort of role that made him
famous, that of an Italian laborer, and
his performance is the usual mixture
of tears and laughter.
Little George Beban, Jr., also ap
pears in this picture and he performs
in a way that makes Papa look to his
laurels. The kid is clever, as is the
rest of the cast, notably Irene Rich
as the Belgian refugee.
What's What in the City
With "Irene" as its attraction, the
Curran can boast of having what is
at present the world's most popular
musical comedy. It is a charming
musical play (in no sense a revue) in
terpreted by a good road company.
Another young lady by the name of
"Mary" holds the stage at the Colum
bia for its fourth and final wec'k. So
far, this speed demon of musical
shows has made the biggest hit of
the present season in San Francisco.
The Orpheum blossoms forth with a
lowered price scale and an unusually
clever bill. The program is headed
by Irene Franklin, one of America's
most popular singing comediennes,
and Howard Hall's much praised Lin
coln playlet is being held over.
