Harding used to say, "Back to Nor

[meager and mpdlocre semi-retirement.

Lest we forget, tomorrow is the day
"for all good men to come to the aid
of the 'Daily. " in the words of the
University Press. When Greek meets
Greek, you know what they do, but
when bum ball player meets bum ball
player, you never can tell. And coup
led with that, the fact that type-slinger
is going to meet bull-slinger. gives us
further food for cogitation.

If that Press Gang throws hot balls!
like they do hot type, they've got us
beaten. This remark is not supposed .
to be studied hv the linotype operator.!

As we gaze speculatively through
an East Encina window, we look upon
the unusual sight of the equistriennes'
and equistrians in facultate serenely'
sitting astride their saddled steeds. A
moment later they trot gracefully [
across the polo field, jouncing in an '
utter abandonment of care-free delight
and wholesome joy. The prof, whose
legs protrude from each side of his
round, fat steed, seems to be suffering
from an attack of spinal shimmyitis.
