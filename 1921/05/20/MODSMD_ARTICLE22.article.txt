# WATER POLO VICTORY GOES TO PALO ALTO
## 
### 
Palo Alto and Sequoia battled for
intramural water-polo honors yester
day, the former winning 5-1. The game
was rather one-sided from the start,
the score at half time being 3 to 1.
This afternoon Alpha Sigma Phi
and El Capitan are playing off the
contest postponed from last Monday.
