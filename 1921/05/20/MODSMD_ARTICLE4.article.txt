# STANFORD POLOISTS MEET SAN MATEO IN FETE DAY GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's polo team will meet the
organization representing the San
Mateo Country Club, at 4:00 o'clock,
on the local polo field, as the conclud
ing feature of the Field Day exercises.
With a handicap of nineteen, the San
Mateo riders are expected to have a
full day's work in defeating the Cardi
nal, especially as their horses are not
used to the hard field. The big factors
in their favor are experience and
thoroughbred, trained horses.
Stanford's best bet in this contest
lies in her team work, as all the Tilen
have worked together for two years.
Cecil, the field captain, has a drive for
the goal that is equal to anything San
Mateo can produce, while Talbert has
the rare ability to carry the ball the
length of the field. Jimmy Quimby
has been displaying pretty form in
his drives in practice, and in Wednes
day's workout carried the ball the
length of the field. Bilger, guarding
the goal, has the advantage of a
speedy horse to aid him in his break
ing up of plays about the posts, a
stunt in which he naturally excels.
For the opposition, Dick Tobin is
the star. Tobin has played for twenty
five years, and has the reputation of
being the foremost polo player in the
west. He is the only man on the
team capable of good team play. Will
Tevis, the field captain, is considered
to have wonderful ability as an in
dividual driver and horseman, but is
slow on teamwork. Schwerin, a pheno
menal discovery, is the youngest play
er on the team.
A three-horse string is to be used
in this contest, the extra horse being
added to speed up the game.
The line-up: San Mateo' (handicap
29) —No. 1, Tobin; No. 2, Schwerin;
No. 3, Tevis (field captain); back.
Hunt.
Stanford (handicap, 10) —No. f,
