# MILITARY TOURNEY AND FIELD DAY TO BE HELD TOMORROW
## Unique Preparations for Ball on Saturday Night Indicate Successful Culmination of Program 
### N. B. Deuel, '24 
Garbed in the meticulous dress of
Uncle Sam or in conventional civilian
attire, Stanford students and visitors
will dance Saturday night at Stanford's
military ball. There will be a fair
sprinkling of men wearing the uniform
of officers high in the service, officers
from the bay region who have accepted
the invitation of the Stanford Military
Department to he present. In addition
to military notables, the Trustees of the
University and Mrs. Herbert Hoover
will represent the civilians.
Preparations are under way, which,
when carried out, will go far toward
making the ball one of the social events
of the season. Whitmer's orchestra,
staged in the center of the floor, as at
the Junior Prom, will furnish music for
the occasion. Novel decorations featur
ing the miltiary will give an appropriate
background to Encina dance floor which
will leave no one in doubt as to the
military significance of the affair. In
cluded in the decorations will lie a model
military encampment at one end of the
hall and field pieces scattered artistically
around the floor will give a unique aspect
to the scene. Patriotism i:- not lacking
in the color scheme, for red, white and
blue is the watchword of the committee,
who will drape the color* from ceiling
and wall. Many flags arranged about
the room will further add color to the
ballroom.
An example of tlu- care to which the
committee has gone to make the dance
a success is furnished in the art posters
advertising the dancv. To insure artistic
work of professional standard in the
posters depicting the dance, the art man
of the California Theater was engaged,
who made posters for the dance similar
to those which are made to describe pic
tures playing at the theater.
Something different from the ordinary
method of conducting a ballSs furnished
by the method of announcing the dances
which will be called by name following a
bugle call. Each of the twelve dances
has a military name. In addition re
freshments will be announced by "mess
call.'' and the affair will end to "taps.
Two hundred tickets have been pre
pared at $3.50 each, a large number of
which have been sold at the present time.
The government has granted an exemp
tion to war tax. The programs, which
arc ready for distribution, still further
carry out the military idea, having as a
design crossed cannons with the cords of
red, white, and blue.

The review of the R. O. T. C. unit
tomorrow at 2 o'clock will introduce the
second annual military field day and
tournament, which will include exhi

F. D. Atkinson and S. K. Hays are serv
ing, and the general committee which
has R. W. Richardson, C. H. Bilger,
P. H. Talbert, W. A. B. Hayne and
R. W. Faville for its members.
The Oakland Techincal High School
Band will furnish the music for the
afternoon. This band is one of the
finest in this section of the state, ac
cording to Major Gallons, and he ex
pects o good performance, although
he regrets that the Stanford organiza
tion odf th stateetaoin shrdlu mmmf
zation will not be assembled for thfe
occasion.
The final, comedy event, of the after
noon will be a rescue-race which will
take placc between the third and fourth
periods of the polo game. Several maid
ens will be stationed at one end of the
field to register distress and certain
"brave knights" will be stationed at the
other, who will carry out the work of a
Launcelot.
Garbed in the meticulous dress of
Uncle Sam or in conventional civilian
attire, Stanford students and visitors
will dance Saturday night at Stanford's
military ball. There will be a fair
sprinkling of men wearing the uniform
of officers high in the service, officers
from the bay region who have accepted
the invitation of the Stanford Military
Department to he present. In addition
to military notables, the Trustees of the
University and Mrs. Herbert Hoover
will represent the civilians.
Preparations are under way, which,
when carried out, will go far toward
making the ball one of the social events
of the season. Whitmer's orchestra,
staged in the center of the floor, as at
the Junior Prom, will furnish music for
the occasion. Novel decorations featur
ing the miltiary will give an appropriate
background to Encina dance floor which
will leave no one in doubt as to the
military significance of the affair. In
cluded in the decorations will lie a model
military encampment at one end of the
hall and field pieces scattered artistically
around the floor will give a unique aspect
to the scene. Patriotism i:- not lacking
in the color scheme, for red, white and
blue is the watchword of the committee,
who will drape the color* from ceiling
and wall. Many flags arranged about
the room will further add color to the
ballroom.
An example of tlu- care to which the
committee has gone to make the dance
a success is furnished in the art posters
advertising the dancv. To insure artistic
work of professional standard in the
posters depicting the dance, the art man
of the California Theater was engaged,
who made posters for the dance similar
to those which are made to describe pic
tures playing at the theater.
Something different from the ordinary
method of conducting a ballSs furnished
by the method of announcing the dances
which will be called by name following a
bugle call. Each of the twelve dances
has a military name. In addition re
freshments will be announced by "mess
call.'' and the affair will end to "taps.
Two hundred tickets have been pre
pared at $3.50 each, a large number of
which have been sold at the present time.
The government has granted an exemp
tion to war tax. The programs, which
arc ready for distribution, still further
carry out the military idea, having as a
design crossed cannons with the cords of
red, white, and blue.

F. D. Atkinson and S. K. Hays are serv
ing, and the general committee which
has R. W. Richardson, C. H. Bilger,
P. H. Talbert, W. A. B. Hayne and
R. W. Faville for its members.
The Oakland Techincal High School
Band will furnish the music for the
afternoon. This band is one of the
finest in this section of the state, ac
cording to Major Gallons, and he ex
pects o good performance, although
he regrets that the Stanford organiza
tion odf th stateetaoin shrdlu mmmf
zation will not be assembled for thfe
occasion.
The final, comedy event, of the after
noon will be a rescue-race which will
take placc between the third and fourth
periods of the polo game. Several maid
ens will be stationed at one end of the
field to register distress and certain
"brave knights" will be stationed at the
other, who will carry out the work of a
Launcelot.
Garbed in the meticulous dress of
Uncle Sam or in conventional civilian
attire, Stanford students and visitors
will dance Saturday night at Stanford's
military ball. There will be a fair
sprinkling of men wearing the uniform
of officers high in the service, officers
from the bay region who have accepted
the invitation of the Stanford Military
Department to he present. In addition
to military notables, the Trustees of the
University and Mrs. Herbert Hoover
will represent the civilians.
Preparations are under way, which,
when carried out, will go far toward
making the ball one of the social events
of the season. Whitmer's orchestra,
staged in the center of the floor, as at
the Junior Prom, will furnish music for
the occasion. Novel decorations featur
ing the miltiary will give an appropriate
background to Encina dance floor which
will leave no one in doubt as to the
military significance of the affair. In
cluded in the decorations will lie a model
military encampment at one end of the
hall and field pieces scattered artistically
around the floor will give a unique aspect
to the scene. Patriotism i:- not lacking
in the color scheme, for red, white and
blue is the watchword of the committee,
who will drape the color* from ceiling
and wall. Many flags arranged about
the room will further add color to the
ballroom.
An example of tlu- care to which the
committee has gone to make the dance
a success is furnished in the art posters
advertising the dancv. To insure artistic
work of professional standard in the
posters depicting the dance, the art man
of the California Theater was engaged,
who made posters for the dance similar
to those which are made to describe pic
tures playing at the theater.
Something different from the ordinary
method of conducting a ballSs furnished
by the method of announcing the dances
which will be called by name following a
bugle call. Each of the twelve dances
has a military name. In addition re
freshments will be announced by "mess
call.'' and the affair will end to "taps.
Two hundred tickets have been pre
pared at $3.50 each, a large number of
which have been sold at the present time.
The government has granted an exemp
tion to war tax. The programs, which
arc ready for distribution, still further
carry out the military idea, having as a
design crossed cannons with the cords of
red, white, and blue.

finest in this section of the state, ac
cording to Major Gallons, and he ex

Garbed in the meticulous dress of
Uncle Sam or in conventional civilian
attire, Stanford students and visitors
will dance Saturday night at Stanford's
military ball. There will be a fair
sprinkling of men wearing the uniform
of officers high in the service, officers
from the bay region who have accepted
the invitation of the Stanford Military
Department to he present. In addition
to military notables, the Trustees of the
University and Mrs. Herbert Hoover
will represent the civilians.
Preparations are under way, which,
when carried out, will go far toward
making the ball one of the social events
of the season. Whitmer's orchestra,
staged in the center of the floor, as at
the Junior Prom, will furnish music for
the occasion. Novel decorations featur
ing the miltiary will give an appropriate
background to Encina dance floor which
will leave no one in doubt as to the
military significance of the affair. In
cluded in the decorations will lie a model
military encampment at one end of the
hall and field pieces scattered artistically
around the floor will give a unique aspect
to the scene. Patriotism i:- not lacking
in the color scheme, for red, white and
blue is the watchword of the committee,
who will drape the color* from ceiling
and wall. Many flags arranged about
the room will further add color to the
ballroom.
An example of tlu- care to which the
committee has gone to make the dance
a success is furnished in the art posters
advertising the dancv. To insure artistic
work of professional standard in the
posters depicting the dance, the art man
of the California Theater was engaged,
who made posters for the dance similar
to those which are made to describe pic
tures playing at the theater.
Something different from the ordinary
method of conducting a ballSs furnished
by the method of announcing the dances
which will be called by name following a
bugle call. Each of the twelve dances
has a military name. In addition re
freshments will be announced by "mess
call.'' and the affair will end to "taps.
Two hundred tickets have been pre
pared at $3.50 each, a large number of
which have been sold at the present time.
The government has granted an exemp
tion to war tax. The programs, which
arc ready for distribution, still further
carry out the military idea, having as a
design crossed cannons with the cords of
red, white, and blue.

The review of the R. O. T. C. unit
tomorrow at 2 o'clock will introduce the
second annual military field day and
tournament, which will include exhi
bitions of the efficiency of the field sec
tions, tractor maneuvers, military riding,
