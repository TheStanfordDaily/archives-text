# Mergenthalers and Underwood Knights Vie for Ball Title

### 
All old scores will be settled and a
few new scores undoubtedly will be
made tomorrow afternoon when the
Line o" Pi basebfill nine (or more), as
the press room gang of the University
printing establishment likes to he called,
and the Line o' Bunks or Daily Palo
Alto reporters hook up on the Varsity
field at 1 o'clock. The main point in
question is whether the line the printers
hand out is faster and more to the point
(used advisedly) than the stuff the
reporters dish out from their Under
woods every day. The argument is of
long standing and it will be settled for
good and all tomorrow.
I he Line o' Pi's have submitted their
lineup, which "Red" Hoerbelt, their
manager, claims is terribly fast, I'rob
ably, he means fast to the ground.
Mayrhofer is slated to dish up the hooks
for the printers. He got that way from
heaving horseshoes. "Red" Hoerbelt,
who catches, is reputed to lack tire, ac
cording to the Daily scout who has been
looking them over. One peek at his
sorrel top gives that the lie.
Howard Brown is slated to do the
heaving for the Line o' Bunk outfit.
Brown tosses a wicked underflip and has
an overhanging drop that is calculated
to mystify the opposition. Bill Leiser
will drop the editorial pen long enough
to drop a few behind the bat.
The Line <>' Pi outfit wants to limit
the game to one inning, or two and one
half hours of play. This question will
be settled before the game begins.
Every member of the Daily staff must
be on hand under penalty of reduction
in tl>e ranks.
