# MEN'S COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP TO BE MADE OVER
## Junior Member to Take Office At Mid-Year Election Beginning With February '22 
### 
The make-up of the Men's Council
for Student Control will be slightly
changed if the proposed amendment
passes at the next election, when it will
be voted on. It is the plan of the
amendment to give the Juniors a repre
sentation on the board at the mid-year
elections and have them carry over to
the middle term in the next year so that
the whole membership of the Men's
Council will not change at one time as
has been -the case in the past.
The change follows:
The following sections shall be sub
stituted for Sections 2 and 3 of Articlc
111 of the Constitution of the Men's
Council for Student Control:
Section 2. The Members of t.he
Men's Council for Student Control shall
be chosen in the following manner:
Nominations of members for the Men's
Council for Student Control shall be
made in the same manner as nominations
for regular student body officers. All
men students who will have completed
eight or more quarters of university
work by the time their term of office
begins, if elected, shall be eligible for
nomination for the general student body
election of June, 1921. All nominations
shall be subject to the approval of the
Men's Council for Student Control.
These names shall then be published in
The Daily Palo Alto along with the
nominees for other student body offices
as required by the election rules of the
A. S. S. U. On the day of election spe
cial ballots bearing these names shall be
handed all students eligible to vote. Each
person shall vote for five of the persons
named thereon, and the five receiving the
highest number of votes, shall be de
clared elected.
Provided, that to insure continuity in
the administration of student control,
the terms of office of the two persons of
the five elected in the June election of
1921 recieving the lowest number of
votes shall expire on the day of the gen
eral February election of 1922. Two
Juniors who have completed at least
six and not more than nine quarters of
University work shall be nominated and
elected at the February election of 1922
in the manner prescribed above. In all
subsequent June elections only three
members who will have completed eight
or more quarters of University work
