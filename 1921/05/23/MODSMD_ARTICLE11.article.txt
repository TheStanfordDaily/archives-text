# POWER OF RADICALS IS ON WANE IN U.S., GENERAL MUIR SAYS
## 
### 
"Judging from all outside evidences,
the radical influence in the United States,
and in Washington and Oregon in par
ticular, has weakened to a great extent,"
was the statement of Major-General
Muir, who has recently transferred to
the Presidio from Seattle, where he was
in charge of the troops stationed in that
section. General Muir visited the campus
for the Military Field Day, coming down
from the Presidio, where lie is in com
mand of the Ninth Corps area.
"Although the radical movement is
still strong in Seattle and the vicinity, it
has been kept in fairly effective check
and though a dangerous centcr yet, the
outbreaks are becoming fewer and fewer,
which leads us to believe that the ele
ment which has been causing the trouble
there is considerably weakened," General
Muir said.
The General explained that the gov
ernment has been deporting undesirables
from this vicinity for quite a while, and
it is due to this aggressive movement by
the authorities that the nfluence of the
I. W. W.'s has been greatly reduced.
With the general settling of conditions
throughout the country and the removal
of the leaders of the hostile movements,
conditions in the north have ceased to
show, externally, much activity. He
mentioned the fact that the copper region
about Butte, Montana, had needed fed
eral troops to keep the radicals in check
all during the war and afterward, until
about four months ago. This section,
General Muir said, was one of the worst
of its kind in the country, and the fact
that there has been no serious disturb
ance in this region since the troops left
seems to indicate that the backbone of
the movement is broken.
"The Japanese question in the North
is not considered as such a great prob
lem as it is in this state," Major-
General Muir stated, "although there are
some sections, such as the White River
valley, which is very thickly populated
with Japanese, where the people are not
only unorganized in whatever opposition
there is, hut some are even favorably
disposed toward them." He remarked
that as the problem was not very serious
in the North he had not given it a great
deal of attention, and as there has been
no issue, political or otherwise, it can not
be said how stnOng either side is in the
northern coast staes.
