# SENIOR SUPPORT
## 
### 
Stanford's endowment no longer cares for the necessities of run
ning- the plant. Whether or not the University grows and develops the
possibilities of the future depends on whether or not it receives the sup
port of its friends and alumni. The graduates are looked to first as
the natural supporters of Stanford.
The senior class is now endeavoring to place its members squarely
in line with those who believe in the University to the extent of actually
supporting it. The insurance plan makes every one who backs it an
individual supporter of Stanford who to tluwt extent is underwriting her
future. While not a great outlay is required of any single man or woman
die collective result will be of material consequence to the University.
Yet we imagine there are those among us whÂ© will object to any
thing savoring of a drive in favor of Stanford. Men and women who
have accepted an education which costs the University several thousands
of dollars per person, will find some reason for not co-operating in the
senior endeavor to the extent of taking out a twenty-year endowment
policy amounting in all to $250.
We have a simple premise before us. Stanford cannot thrive with
out the aid of its alumni and friends. Is the senior among those who
believe in the ideals and education of the University of which he has
been a small part during the last four years, <>r must he admit Jhat he
has chosen a University the spirit and purpose of which does not move
him to the extent of getting behind tin- senior undertaking, which re
quires individually about $10 a year?
The present senior class is in a better position to put over the valu
able insurance plan than has been any previous organization. There arc
none of the characteristic long-standing debts that require a deep digging
in the pockets of the members. The class has had the insurance plan in
mind a long time. It has been discussed in class meetings where oppo
sition, had there been any, should have developed. In accordance with
the decision of the class the committee appointed has developed a very
definite plan for reaching every member of the class with the favorable
policy which they have secured. The whole activity is to be concluded in
a very few days. The co-operation/mi the part of the class members that
the committee has been led to believe would be forthcoming will place
the total result well up in the thousands.
How '96 and '97 Are Doing It
About twenty-five years ago a small group of students took degrees
from Stanford. An insurance scheme on their part would have brought
small return to the University. Herbert Hoover not long ago suggested
that if each class could at its twenty-fifth anniversary make a gift to the
University, of whatever amount could be raised, the result would be of
tiemendous value. Accordingly, '06 set about to get together from
its small number of members the sum of $25,(XX), more than twenty-live
years after leaving the farm, and indications are that the full sum will be
presented to the University soon. Ninety-seven is getting upder way and
will undoubtedly be ready to do its part when its twenty-fifth anniversary
arrives.
The plan of '21 does not involve waiting twenty years, when to be
in a class with '96 we would have to get together about $100,000. The
present insurance plan, fully supported by the seniors, with the small
outlay of $10 per person, will automatically provide our gift at our
twenty-fifth anniversary five years before it arrives. And the respon
sibility will not fall on the heads of a few hardworking enthusiasts twen
ty-five years after we leave the farm.
