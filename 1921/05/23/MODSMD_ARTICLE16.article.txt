Two amendments, one to the constitution of the student body, and
ilie other to the law* governing the Men's Council are up for student
decision Wednesday. The latter provides that two members of the
council shall be elected in February of their junior year, to hold office
for one year. This scheme will give continuity and experience lo the.
body as a whole.
The amendment to the constitution dealing with the Daii.v Palo
Alto is in part an incorporation of the present organization plan into the
constitution. It also provides a slightly new plan of nominating editors,
and sets up an advisory committee to act with the Daily.
Roth amendments deserve the investigation of student body mem
bers, and both, we believe, are worthy of support.
