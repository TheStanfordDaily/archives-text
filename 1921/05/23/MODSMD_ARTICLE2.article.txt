# Press Nine Defeats Daily Reporters in Weird Ball Game
## 
### 
Mayrhofer lmtl too much stuff, and
the University Press team, known as the
Lina Pi's, ran away with the long end
of a 17-to-8 score in the game with the
Daily staff Saturday afternoon. Fact of
the matter is, they were running most of
tlic time when they were not clouting the
spheroid hither and yon, which was
often. The Line o' Bunks have but one
alibi to offer: they didn't have a
chucker who could fool the typos. Every
man who essayed to pitch (and every
man did) found difficulty in missing the
hats of the opposition.
The Daily reporters scored the first
run of the game in the first frame, but
the printers came right back with three
in their half, and after that proceeded
to run the total up to 17 runs to 3.
Eddie West pitched the first three
innings and allowed eleven runs. He
was succeeded by Howard Brown, who
fared but little better during the fourth
frame. Glenn Pollard pitched the last
two innings and was the most successful
in keeping the scampcring printers away
from the rubber.
Meanwhile the Line o' Bunks got to
the delivery of Mayrhofer and ran their
total up to eight markers before the
game was called in the seventh inning.
"Red" Hoerbelt, the sorrel-topped're
ceiver of the typo gang, was the star of
the game. "Red" connected for three
binglcs in four trips to the pentagon and
stopped a wild pitch with his shin, which
taken all in all was a good day's work.
Bill Leiser, the Daily's catcher, vied
â– with "Red" for stellar honors, making
the first bingle off the Press pitcher's
delivery.
Bruce Templeton handled the indica
tor and escaped unscathed.
