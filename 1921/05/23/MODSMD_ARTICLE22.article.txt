A Banquet for Pally
It is a favorite indoor sport with
many people (that sounds nice and
grown-up, doesn't it?) to speak slight
ingly of their own home town. The
movie theatres of Palo Alto have come

city throw so mo Interesting light on
the subject.
The attraction at the Portola is
Hebe Daniels in "Ducks and Drakes,"
which was shown here at the Stan
ford some three weeks ago. The Hip
podrome's feature, "The Marriage of
William Ashe," was viewed by patrons
of the Varsity about two weeks ago,
while the California's current attrac
tion, "Sacred and Profane Love," will
also be at the Varsity later this week.
Old Pally is not so far behind the
f times at that.
