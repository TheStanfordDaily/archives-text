Editor I Jaily Palo Alto :
In last I-riday's issue of the Daily the
Editor saw lit to hand the royal rasp
berry to the Stanford Hand for "refus
ing," as he said, to play at the Military
! bete. The Editor seems to have the
I idea that the members of the hand are
'tint entitled to have business of their
, own at times when there is some uni
versity function taking place. If the
writer of the editorial will think back
; carefully he will remember that the
! Stanford Band has played for at least
three special events in the last month.
That takes time. Are we to understand
that although any other student has a
right to be present or absent from any
special university occasion, according to
his own private plans, the members of
the band MUST not, and that if it hap
| pens that on a certain day a number of
the members of the band arc unable to
be present the band lacks the Stanford
spirit, and does not care to co-operate
in making a success of that particular
occasion. The narrow-mindedness of
.the editorial was surprising. Ml through
the college year the band has been glad
jto do all it could to help, and has shown
its spirit by being present and playing
at athletic events when the bleachers
J showed that about three-fourths of the
student body were "BUSY" at affairs of
their own. The band has been glad to
play at assemblies. Junior Week festivi
tics, Labor Days, Alumni Days and
numerous other events, but should the
members of the band lind it impossible
to function at ONE special/occasion, woe
,be! They draw down upon them the
condemnation and biting sarcasm of one
who would strive ever to promote the
| harmony and success of this university
through the medium of the editorial
column, which SHOULD be devoted to
building up good, will and spirit among
student organizations, rather than rent
ing antagonism. If the attack in the
editorial was justified, the hand would
feel duly humbled, but in the present
case the members of the band know
that they have done their part ns far as
they have been able, and the idea of
being told that they lack the Stanford
spirit will not in the least spur them on
to greater efforts at co-operation.
