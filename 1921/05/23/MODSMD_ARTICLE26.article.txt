# MAY PICTORIAL TO GO ON QUAD SALE TUESDAY MORNING

### 
"The Pulse of Undergraduate Opin
ion" has for its first pulsation an edi
torial called "Publish the Names." The
names referred to are those of the men
who are found guilty by the Men's
cheating, drunkenness and
similar offenses which come before tlrtfir
jurisdiction. The point is rased that the
mere announcement of the suspension of
a student for cheating is not a very long
step toward the general correction of
the evil.
'Home-coming Week" is another of
the editorials which are expressing the
undergraduate opinion. It agitates a
home-coming week for alumni such as
is an institution at the larger Eastern
colleges. It states that one alumni day
is insufficient and the students should
irrange for a whole week in which to
â€¢git their alumni back and entertain
them.
The other editorials are on the sub
jects of scholarship and profiteering
It is suggested that the thinker be given
a second chance by the Stanford scholar
ship committee, as they are given at
I'rinceiton, Although the Lower Di
vision system does away with the neces
sity for this to a large extent, the editor
suggests that the authorities might do
well to investigate this plan.
"A Death Blow to Profiteering" con
gratulates tlu executive committee on
the success of ihe recent ruling which
provides for the approval of prices <>n
tickets to dances and theatrical perform
ances which have been heretofore un
regulated- The editor believes that, as
well as offering some relief to the* over
strained wallet of the queener, it will
encourage the managers of the various
productions to further economy.
