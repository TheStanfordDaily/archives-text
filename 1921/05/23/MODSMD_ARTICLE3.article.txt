# COMMISSIONS ARE GIVEN AT MILITARY FETE DAY
## Army Chiefs Visit Campus for Awarding of Coveted Sheepskins 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
The stJcond annual Military Field Day
was ushrred in last Saturday by a salute
of thirteen guns, announcing the arrival
of Major-General Muir on the campus.
Shortly after his arrival General Muir
and Colonels Falls and Fitch reviewed
the battery of field artillery which coin
prises the Stanford R. O. T. C. unit.
Following this, President Wilbur pre
sented the commissions to the newly ap
pointed reserve and cadet officers, and
Miss Elizabeth McGee, '21, presented
the commissions, with their spurs and
insignia of rank.
The events of the tournament were
next in order. The first event was the
section contest. The horses were un
harnessed and unhitched, and at the
sounding of the call to arms were re-

| harnessed and hitched, with speed as an
abject. The rest of the drill was not
contested, that of independently gallop
ing forward 100 yards and firing a shot,
because it was feared that the horses
were still too skittish and might lose
their heads and tangle things up if this
portion of the exhibition were executed
in contest. The maneuver was com
pleted as a battery, and section four was
adjudged winner on the basis of the
time it took to harness and hitch. The
time necessary to complete the whole
operation was announced as 4:29, allow
ing a liberal period for the untimed por
tion. Ihe army record is four minutes.
J he next event to be run off. after the
tractor exhibition, was the. bucking
horse contest. Mr. Tevis, the largest
handicapped player and considered the
best rider on the San Mateo polo squad,
rode first. The horse started out all
right and appeared to be full of fire, but
after a few sceonds the mare burnt out
and the greatest amount of stimulation
could elicit no more than what would
otherwise be considered a playful sally
with its hind feet. Paul Talbert, '22,
then took an easy $6 worth of show
tickets with nothing more difficult to
weather than a few stiff-legged jumps
and twin-barreled kicks which are the
daily performance of the most docile
artillery equine.
S. E. Vaughan, '23, won the jumping
event with a very low score, only having
one refusal and a hind-foot touch
chalked against him. The trophy was a
silver cup given by the officers of the
unit. G. R. Amberg, '23, pointed second
in this event. The horses showed up
very well for all-'rounders and, consider
ing that three quarters is the maximum
riding experience for the corps men, the
horses were well jumped. Amberg won
a $4 jewelry order for his performance.
The women's equitation class next
executed a series of maneuvers before,
the judges, and Miss Frances Cooper,
'21, was awarded the prize as the best
rider of the group. The prize was a
silver vanity case with a Stanford crcst
embossed on it. and a box of candy.
The prize was presented by General
Muir.
The high jump followed and was won
by W. A. I'. Hayne, '22. who cleared
four feet, winning a silver cup donated
by Lieutenant H. P. Stolz. G. R. Am
berg. '23, who placed second, received a
pipe, which was donated by the United
Cigar Store*.
The polo game was the last event on
the program. The San Mateo players
entered the field with a 29 handicap to
the Stanford 10, but in a few periods
overcame that and finally won by the
score of 7 to 0. Between the third and
fourth periods of the game, two couples
struggled to the center of the field and,
having attained it. continued to struggle
until two representatives of the R. O. T.
C. could gain the slippery backs of their
respective steeds and get them started
in the direction of the struggle. The
pageant had all the earmarks of a suc
cessful rescue until the horses decided
they had business elsewhere when they
had only half made the distance. Finally
