# KAPPA ALPHA WINS FROM THETA CHI NINE
## 
### 
A last minute rally won for the
Kappa Alpha nine in a seventh round
contest with Delta Chi. The final score
was five to four. The losers had the
edge on the victors as far as fielding
is concerned but they lacked the ne
cessary punch to cinch the score.
Rousselot heaved for Kappa Alpha
and Reticker took the mound for
Delta Chi. The latter twirler swung
a mean willow in the first inning and
accounted for a home run. Another
continuous trip was made in the next
period by Conard of the same outfit.
Delta Chi batters connected for seven
bingles off Rousselot, while the oppo
sition found Reticker for only three
hits. Sutherland, Kappa Alpha second
baseman, came to bat in the last frame
and reached first on an error. He
stole second and third and scored the
ginning run on a short hit.
Phi Delta Theta finished the sched
ule of league two by receiving a for
feite from Chi Psi. This gives Phi
Delta Theta the league championship
with seven straight victories. The
aforesaid collection of ball artists will
make a strong bid for first place in
the intramural "world series" which
starts Wednesday.
Kappa Sigma went through the same
round in a similar manner, winning
from Zeta Psi by forfeit. The congest
which will decide first honors in the
fourth league was scheduled to be
played torfight j between the Kappa
Sigma and Delta Kappa Epsilon nines.
Sigma Chi and Alpha Kappa Lambda
also won by forfeits.
