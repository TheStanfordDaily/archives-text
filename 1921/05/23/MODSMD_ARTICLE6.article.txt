# "Commencement" Chappie Contributions Due Soon
## 
### 
Wednesday, the 25th, is the last day
for contributions for the Commence
ment number of Chaparral to be turned
in. This will be the last issue of the
year and also the last one to be edited
by the present staff. Any sort of jokes,
long or short, arc desired, and in multi
tude in order that "Chappie" may lay
down the hammer this year with a loud
knock.
