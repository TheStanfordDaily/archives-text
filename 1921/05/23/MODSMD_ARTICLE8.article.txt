# COAST SINGLES TITLE CAPTURED By J. M. DAVIES
## Cardinal Racqueter Disposes of Wallace Bates in Final Match of Conference Play 
### 
Jimmy Davies, representing the
Cardinal at the Pacific Coast Confer
ence tennis tournament held at Eu
gene, Oregon, Friday and Saturday,
again won the coast intercollegiate
singles championship by defeating his
old rival, Wallace Bates of California,
in four hard-fought sets. The match
between Bates and Davies was one of
the longest played in the singles tour
nament and the last two sets ran into
fourteen and twelve games respec
tively. The final score of the match
was 6-4, 6-3, 6-8, 7-5.
In the doubles championship, the
Stanford team of Neer and Davies
made one of the best showings of
the tournament, having little-trouble
in winning their way into the finals
be defeating all northern competition
in the preliminary rounds. In the
final match, played against Bates and
Levy of California, the Stanford pair
lost out after forcing their rivals to
extend the bout to the full limit of
five sets. Bates and Levy captured
the first two sets, 6-2, 6-4, but Davies
and Neer staged a comeback in the
next two, winning them at 7-5, and 6-2.
The fifth and deciding set of the
match was won by the California team,
6-4, dividing the honors of the tourna
ment with the Cardinal.
In the matches of the singles tourna
ment played Friday, all northern com
petition was eliminated, leaving the
championship to be played between
Davies of Stanford and Bates and Levy
of California. Davies met the Cali
fornia captain in the semi-finals and
easily proved himself a master of the
game by disposing of him in two
straight sets, 6-0, 6-3.
It is the second time that Bates and
Davies have met this season, the first
time being in the dual tournament
with California on the Eneina courts
in the early part of this quarter. Here,
Bates defeated the Cardinal star but
Davies had just finished a season with
the Basketball squad and was not in
the best of form. This is the sec
ond consecutive year that Davies has
won the intercollegiate title. He also
annexed the open singles champion
ship at the Ojai Valley tournament last
month.
Today, the Stanford team plays the
first match of their extensive eastern
trip, going against the University of
Washington squad at Seattle. The
Purple and Gold team has a squad of
veterans but according to the showing
they made at the Pacific Coast Confer
ence tournament, the 'Card' racquet
ers should have but little trouble in
taking the bout. From Seattle, they
will go to Spokane, for a match with
Â«he Spokane Amateur Athletic Club.
