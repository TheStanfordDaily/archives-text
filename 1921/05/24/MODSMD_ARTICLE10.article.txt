# UNIVERSITY LIFE TO BE THEME OF TALK AT LITTLE THEATRE
## Reverend Willard Sperry Will Speak in Little Theatre on College Methods and Ideals 
### 
Rev. Willard L. Sperry of the Cen
tral Congregational Church of Boston,
will speak in the Little Theater, this
evening, on "English and American
University Methods and Ideals." Rev.
Sperry spoke at the Memorial Church
last Sunday morning and will be the
University preacher for the next two
Sundays, May 29 and June 5.
Rev. Sperry spent two years at Ox
ford, as a Rhodes Scholar and knows
the English as well as the American
university methods and ideals. He
will emphasize the fact that the Eng
lish university recognizes that there
are two types of students: the student
who comes to college for the friend
ships, social life and college spirit;
and the student who comes with the
definite aim to learn how to use his
own mind because he has to live by
his brains in a profession or business.
The English university, following this
recognition, divides all courses into
two groups, pass schools and honor
schools. The object of the honor
schools, Rev. Sperry says, is not to
give definite instruction to be re
membered, but to teach them to do in
dependent and first-hand thinking.
This throws back into the under
graduate courses something of the
method which in American universi
ties is confined to the Master's and
Doctor's degrees. In. this way Oxford
is at present saving two or three years
which are wasted in our American
system and about which President
Lowell of Harvard recently com
plained.
He has been the pastor of the Cen
tral Congregational Church in Boston
since 1914. Along with his duties in
the capacity he has many outside in
terests. He is an associate professor
of practical theology at the Andover
Theological Seminary, and is a trustee
of Wheal ton College. He has written
articles for English reviews and Amer
ican magazines, principally "The At
lantic Monthly."
