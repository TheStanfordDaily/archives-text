# C. L. MC CORMICK WILL SING PART IN "FAUST"
## 
### 
The announcement by Director War
ren D. Allen, today, that C. L. McCor
mick, '19, has been engaged to sing
the part of Wagner, the leader of the
famous chorus scenes for which
"Fauf.t" is famous, is bringing him
widespread congratulations from the
campus and Palo Alto public that re
members McCormick's brilliant work
as a soloist during his entire four
years at Stanford. Mr. Henry S. Titus,
originally cast for the part, has been
obliged to give up the role due to
pressure of other work.
The Kermesse scene will call forth
McCormick's best, Mr. Allen said to
day. This great chorus scene involv
es soldiers who strut and ogle at the
girls; rollicking drinking-songs, by
the students; and the flirting and
laughter of pretty village damsels.
Wagnerian ingenuities of orchestra
tion are called in to fully transcribe
this lively and genial scene.'
McCormick, who is now living in
San Francisco, has recently returned
from a trip to Guatemala, on which
he went on behalf of the coffee im
porting firm with which he is con
nected. He graduated in June, 1919,
and majored in History.
Faculty mothers are much interested
in the children's performance of "Faust"
which will be given in the Assembly Hall
on Saturday morning at 9:15 sharp,
when the final rehearsal of the opera
will be thrown open to children of Palo
Alto and Stanford at a charge of 25
cents. The rehearsal will anticipate the
Tuesday evening performance in every
respect, as Miss Fay, Mr. Bevani, Mr.
Battison, and Mr. McCormick, with 25
members of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, will be on the campus
for the rehearsal.
A feature of the event on Saturday
morning will be the few words of ex
planation with which Mr. Allen will
preface each step of the great opera, so
that his young audience may understand
both the exciting story unfolded in the
music, and the music itself. The re
hearsal will be the greatest lesson in
musical appreciation and education ever
offered to the local school children.
