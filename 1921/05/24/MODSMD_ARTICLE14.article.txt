# HONOR SYSTEM PROPOSAL RECEIVES APPROVAL AND SUPPORT OF FACULTY
## New Practice Will Be In Effect In This Quarter's Final Examinations 
### 
The Stanford faculty, acting upon a petition from the students, has ap
proved the plan for an honor system in examinations throughout the Uni
versity. The honor system will be put into effect in the final examination#,
of the present quarter in June.
Responsibility for honesty in the conduct of examinations is by this ac
tion placed upon the students individually and collectively through depart
mental organizations and the student councils. Infractions of the honor
system will be punished by the student councils in the same manner at
other actions of discipline. The faculty of Stanford has thus given to
the students the handling of all matters of discipline in the student body;
the action of the student councils, men and women, being subject to re
view only by the president of the University.
The students some time ago on their own volition started a movement
for the installation of the honor system throughout the University. It. ha*

been in successful operation in sow*,
departments for a number of yean*
and at a student body election a very
large majority of the entire student
membership of the University petition
ed the faculty to install this system,,
fend in addition nearly all the students
signed individual pledge cards to nj»-
hold the system if it were installed.
The responsibility of the professors
hereafter ends with providing a room
where examinations may be held with
out crowding, or also providing al
ternate sets of questions. The pro
fessor, after he has answered !»
quiries, will withdraw from the room.
In case he himself learns of instance®
of dishonesty in examinations he will
report them to the president ot thw
University, who will transmit the c-aseß
to the council of the men or the wo
men students, as may be.
Upper Division students will Croati
an Honor System Committee which
will arrange for assemblies of new
students early in each quarter to ex
plain the honor system and which will
promote the organization of depart
mental groups to handle the system
within the departments and will pre
pare a statement to be printed for the
information of incoming students and
in general is to assume leadership in
developing and strengthening student
opinion and responsibility with regard
to the honor system.
Hereafter new ' students entering
Stanford will be given an intelligence
test, the record of which will be ad
ded to the other data on the student'*
