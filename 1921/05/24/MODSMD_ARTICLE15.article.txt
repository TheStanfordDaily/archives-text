mural season. The final score was
9 to 2. Last year's varsity twirler,
Newlands, took the mound for Kappa.
Sigma and heaved fine ball mixing his;
pace cleverly. Almost the .same
amount of credit can be given Gilll»
who hurled for the losers in a high
class fashion. Both pitchers gained
six strikeouts. Newlands allowed Ave
hits and Gillis eight. A hit by the
victors meant a run, while the D. K_. 16
batters failed to bunch their bits..
The only long swat of the game wan
made off Newlands in the fifib inning,
by Williamson, scoring Devlin.
A one, two, three, retirement lb*
each side closed the first frame. In
the second, Farish started Kappa Sig

bingle. Newlands reached first on an
error by the shortstop. Helwig hit a.
hot one to the third baseman who
fumbled and overthrew first base.
Farish and Newlands scored. Two
outs ended the inning. The return
punch by the opposition consisted of
a hit, two strikeouts, and another out.
In the next period Gillis also bung,
up two strikeout scalps. The D. K. E.
stick men wero sent to the bench on
threo successive putouts. Kappa Sig
ma made another run in the following
inning when Rogers caught hold o*
a hook-ball and drove through UtmL
base territory bringing In Newlandit.
During the cnt.iro contest Rogers wa*
the life of the party with hi« accomp
lished baseball chatter. In the t«amr
i inning Delta Kappa Epsilon scored
' for their initial tijlly. Chandler hit
through the keystone position and
| stole second on the throw. Hinkley
| brought in Chandler with a fast bingle
! across the second bag. Gill is weaken

The losers made their last tally in
i the same period when a triple-bagger
by Williamson brought Devlin home.
I Powell and Dillon scored for the win
] ners in the sixth inning. Delta Kappa
j Epsilon hopes were dashed in the last
i of the sixth by a pretty double-play,
i Parish to Rogers, on what looked like,
j a sure hit, and also by a throw from
i pitcher to first which caught Hinckley
i off the bag. No runs were made in the
i last inning.
Another championship plaque was
j captured on the freshman diamond
! when El Quadro's last minute rally
I was responsible for a fourteen to
j
j eleven victory over Sigma Chi. The
: game contained a good deal of ragged
! playing. The score was tied by Sigma
j Chi in the sixth frame, when Cleveland
j and Talbert came home on two throws
,to third. El Cuadro put the contest
j on ice in the Inst of the sixth with
j the score of eleven all. Neer, Mills,
j and Torre> scored. At the beginning
| of the fourth inning El Cuadro was
j leading, eleven to two. However, in
1 that period the Sigma Chi batsmen
j connected plentifully with Purdy's de
j livery and circled the bags seven
! times. Robinson replaced Purdy in
i the box and halted the hitting orgy
by means of two strikeouts. Two more
! runs in the sixth tied the score.
