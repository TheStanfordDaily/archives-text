# A
						FINAL STEP IN STUDENT CONTROL
## 
### 
With the establishment of the honor system for final examinations of
this quarter the final step is made in the establishment of student control
at Stanford. There is now no disciplinary action of any hind that is not
in the hands of student body organs, and the student body now assumes
the whole responsibility for student conduct on the farm. The students
have asked, and now have received entire, complete control.
The installation of the honor system leaves its enforcement princi
pally with the individual student. The professor's responsibility ends
when he provides a room and questions for examinations. The problem
is then with the- students. Should there be infractions by men who at
their own request are working under the honor plan, the method of
dealing with them is left to the Men's or Women's Council. The faculty
makes it clear that the action is no half-way measure. It is a pure student
honor system, for the students to enforce in the best way they can.
If the men and women of Stanford can work out this system so that
examinations are fairly conducted oh a real honor plan, Stanford will be
<>iie of the few universities whose students are able to work successfully
under such a scheme. It means, too, that every Stanford graduate will
be a better Stanford man, for a four years' college course under a real
honor system, with actual student responsibility, is conducive to the devel
opnientof the character of man Stanford aims to graduate. It goes with
out saying that men who work on their own responsibility here will be
better able to work on their own responsibility elsewhere.
Stanford students have long talked of student control. They now
have student control to the fullest extent. There are practically no limi
tations. It remains for Stanford students to show that they can take
care of the responsibilities for which they have asked. In the honor sys
tem this is principally an individual problem. There is no reason why
the character of the Stanford student should not measure up to life per
sonal qualifications demanded for the successful operation of the honor
system. t
