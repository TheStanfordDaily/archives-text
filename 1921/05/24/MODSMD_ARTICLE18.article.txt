# STRAIGHTEN THEM OUT

Two important phases of student activity art* referred to the students
tomorrow.
An amendment to the constitution- -governing the Men's Council
has been worked out to give that body a degree of continuity, the lack
of which has been its greatest handicap since the founding of this body.
Under the present scheme five new council members are elected at the
end of each year. They take office, all new at their positions, with no
idea of how previous councils have functioned, and they must start at the
beginning as the first council did several years ago. Nothing is gained
from the experience of those who have gone before.
The amendment provides that three men .shall be elected in June as in
the past, and that two juniors be chosen in February to hold office until
the middle of their senior year. At no time, then, would all live mem
bers of the council be inexperienced members. In October the two
elected the previous February have the experience of their halt term
to guide the three seniors who take office at that time; and in the follow
ing February two new juniors come into the body which already has
three experienced seniors.
The difficulty of this amendment is that by constitution "two-thirds
of fifty per cent" of the electorate is necessary to pass it. In other
words, one-third of all those clcgiblc to vote must -rote, and vote for the
amendment, or it will be defeated.
The rewritten portion of the student body constitution governing
the Daily Palo Alto incorporates into the fundamental law of the stu
dent body a number of rules that to date have been applied from the
memory of interested students alone. An advisory committee is set up
to work with the Daily Palo Alto whenever it may be of
The basic framework of both editorial and business organizations of
the Daily are outlined in the new amendment, and should provide future
stability.
A constitution should not be amended by a handful of voters. The
law of the Student Council can not be amended without a full one-third
of the electorate casting favorable ballots. Consequently the balloting
tomorrow will be fruitless so far as the important council change goes,
unless a great many students, particularly uppcrclassmen, get out to
I lie polls.

INTELLIGENT TESTS are now on the program for entering stu
dents. It will be interesting to note whether students of the higher
intelligence tests set up the better records in their courses.

WE HAVE HEARD of the reducing high cost of living, but the six cent
"Coke" of the last few days is about the first and only evidence that has
so far reached our out-of-the-wav community.
