## 
### 
Memorial Day will be celebrated by
the students of Stanford University,
on Sunday, May 29, with a ceremony
in the Memorial Church, which will
fittingly commemorate the Stanford
men who have sacrificed their lives
in the service of their country. Divine
services will be held in the morning
at which all classes in the University,
as well as members of the faculty,
will gather to do honor to the glorious
dead.
The students will assemble by class
es in the Memorial Court and march
in a body to the Church, in order of
precedence. Presidents of each class
will sit on the east side of the chan
cel, while the seats on the west side
will be reserved for President Wilbur,
Dr. Gardner, Reverend Mr. Sperry,
preacher of the day, and F. L. McEl
roy. President of the Student Body.
The services will be opened by the de
dication of a memorial wreath in the
chancel, following which a choral
poem, "Supreme Sacrifice," will be
sung by the choir.
The speaker of the day will be the
Reverend Willard L. Sperry, Pastor
of tiie Central Congregational Church
of Boston. Following the delivery of
the sermon, a prayer will be offered.
Two musical numbers will then be
given, Tennyson's hymn, "Crossing
the Bar." and an anthem by the choir,
"Gounod Sanctum." The Benediction
will then close a ceremony dedicated
throughout to the honor of those who
have made the supreme sacrifice.
