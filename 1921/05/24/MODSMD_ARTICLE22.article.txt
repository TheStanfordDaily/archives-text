Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Your editorial of Friday last headed
j" Hie Band Is Busy," was so untrue in
fact and implication that some reply is
called for. During the current year to
■date the band has appeared publicly 26
times at various University games,
rallies, concerts, benefits, and similar
occasions. No request has been refused.
These appearances represent 64 hours in
uniform—eight working days. They
represent also 8(1 hours at rehearsal. For
this no recompense was received, nor lias
there ever been a word of appreciation,
thanks, or encouragement from your
paper. Nor was any expected. It was
simply classwork -with the traditional
idea of service and routine. Has any
Stanford group shown Rreater willing
ness or greater unselfishness?
Of the thirty men now in the band,
many are under scholarship disabilities,
or are so busy with studies and outside
work that they are not free agents in the
disposal of their time. In addition, a
considerable number are working Satur
days and after hours to meet their
tuition and term bills. For Alumni Day,
a band of twenty-five was gotten to
gether with difficulty. The spirit shown
by a few in giving up Saturday jobs, and
the shifting of certain men to other than
their regular instruments enabled us
to do this. The program was necessarily
of the lightest kind—but il was the best
we could do.
When the request f?>r Military Day
came, it was found that less than twenty
would be available and these were in
strumentally unsuitable. This was fully
explained to the military authorities and
was apparently fully understood and ac
cepted. You could have learned these
facts in five minutes.
But your editorial had at least one
result. If the student body feels as you
do, it is evident that our present system
of maintaining a distinct student body
band under faculty supervision yo longer
meets our local situation. Either the
band must be fully militarized, as at
various state universities, or it must be
frankly recognized as an economic prob
lem, and some compensation given the
men for the long hours required. This
has been done at the University of Chi
cago, and at lowa, and Illinois—by re
mitting the tuition fee in whole or in
part. Either system will free the studoßt
body from expense and' responsibility,
and make such editorials as yours im
possible. F. W. BERGSTKOM. '18.
