# SENIOR BENCH PLAN WEAKENS; SALE TO BE CONTINUED TOMORROW
## 
### 
Senior green peas failed to materialize
this a. m. to any great extent and the
promoters of the gct-rich-quick Senior
Pench scheme for the hardy knights of
the Stetson were frankly disappointed
today when the bubble of the scheme so
disastrously fell through. It is the wish
of the committee on promotion that the
sale be announced again for tomorrow,
when the beautiful sex of the Seniors
will attempt to wring the quarters from
the tightened pocketbooks of the worn
out sons of '21 and the hangovers from
the classes that have "gone but not for
gotten."
