### 
With the returns from the campaign
for funds for the Near East Relief not
yet complete, the sum now stands at
$1470. This includes the money turned
in at the luncheon given for the repre
sentatives of the living groups, three
sororities, five fraternities, and only par
tial reports from Roble, Sequoia, Encina,
the faculty and students in Palo Alto.
The committee in charge of the cam
paign is anxious to have a complete re
port as soon as possible and representa
tives will be in the Y. M. C. A. office in
the Union tomorrow to receive reports
from the workers who have not yet
turned in their money and pledges.
