# SOPHOMORES DEFEAT FRESHMEN IN DEBATE
## 
### 
The freshmen went down to defeat
at the hands of the sophomores in the
annual debate held last night at the
Little Theater, on the question, "Re
solved, That women students shall be
admitted to Stanford beyond the 500-
limit now set by the University." A
two-to-one decision in favor of the '23
speakers, who upheld the affirmative,
was rendered by judges Dean Harriet
Bradford, Professor L. E. Bassett, and
Registrar O. L. Elliott. Debating
Coach Miller L. McClintock acted as
chairman of the evening. Outbursts
of applause from the audience of more
than half a hundred marked the course
of the debate, in which 7-minute
speeches were allowed, with four min
utes of rebuttal to each speaker.
V. E. Cappa, opening the debate for
the affirmative, asserted that the situ
ation as it at present existed was de
plorable, and that the women, while
chosen on a superior fitness rating,
have not made the record expected
of them, this due to the creation of
an artificial situation which results
in the concentration of social activities
on a few women, with a consequent
subordination of the scholarship ideal
to the social ideal. Emmet McCaf
fery, the first freshman speaker, ad
vanced the argument that it was an
express wish of one of the founders
of the University, Mrs. Stanford, that
the number of women be limited to
500, and asserted that we have no
moral right to go against the wishes
of one who made the University pos
sible.
John Field, continuing the debate for
the affirmative, distinguished himself
by his forcefulness and wit as the
ablest sophomore speaker. He made
the point that the increase in the
number of women until a balance was
reached is in line with the present
tendency in education towards equal
opportunities for men and women, that
this would better the social conditions
and raise the scholastic standard, and
finally, he cited the case of Adam and
Eve as a refutation of the four-to-one
policy of Stanford. H. J. Durand, the
second speaker for the negative, said
that the present economy in educa
tion and finance would be disrupted
by the introduction of more women,
as money would be taken away from
the departments in which Stanford has
always specialized, to put it into new
departments for women, and that a
great deal of money would be needed
to provide proper accommodations
for the new students.
In closing the debate for the affirma
tive, L. 13. Minsky advanced the pro
position of the organization of a
separate endowment fund for the
maintenance of an increase in co-edu
cation. giving Comptroller Roth as an
authority for its feasibility. M. ().
Tobriner, in concluding the freshman
arguments, characterized himself as
the leading debater for the negative.
He made the point that such an en
dowment, if it were possible to raise,
should be used to improve the pres
ent inadequate facilities of housing
and eating, rather than taking on the
added burden of more women.
