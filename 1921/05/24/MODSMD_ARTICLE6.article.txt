# CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS TO BE VOTED UPON
## Changes in Organization of Daily Palo Alto and Men's Council are Recommended 
### 
Amendments to the A. S. S. U. con
stitution providing for changes in the
organization of The Daily Palo Alto and
of the Men's Counci lfor Student Con
trol will be voted on at a quad election
tomorrow.
The chief recommendation in the pro
posed Daily amendment provides for the
appointment of a nadvisory committee,
who shall work in co-operation with the
editorial and managerial staffs and the
executive committee. This body will be
composed of students who have had
newspaper experience but wlio have not
been connected with The Daily Palo
Alto for at least three months prior to
their appointment. They shall keep in
touch with the paper and may examine
the books at any time, but will have only
ad visorv and recommending powers.
Preference in voting for editor of the
Daily by members of the staff would be
by seniority rather than by staff rating,
according to the proposed amendment.
Other editorial and business manage
ment practices now in use are included
in the amendment, which was recom
mended to the executive committee last
week by a committee which had been in
vestigating conditions on the Daily for
several months.
The change in the organization of the
Men's Council would give juniors a rep
resentation on the board at mid-year
election and carry them over into the
middle of the following year, thus allow
ing a continuity of policy. Under the
present system the entire membership
changes at one time.
