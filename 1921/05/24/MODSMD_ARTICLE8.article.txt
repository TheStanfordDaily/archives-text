Partial returns from the Hall and the
Row show tliat $20,000 has been raised
in the first day of the senior class' cam
paign to raise a $50,000 endowment fund.
The campaign will continue through
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Cir
cular letters are to he sent to all mem
bers of the senior class who are not at
present in college. The committee hopes
to raise the entire sum by the end of this
week. To raise the $50,000 sÂ«"t as the
aim, 200 policies at $250 each must be

dents who will remain in college to take
advanced degrees, contracts to take out
insurance on obtaining degrees may be
signed. The plan to be used in raising
the funds is: Each member of the senior
class is expected to take out a twenty
year endowment policy on his life, mak
ing Stanford University his beneficiary

by assignment. Policies for the sum of
$250 up will be written. A yearly pay
ment of approximately $10 a year will
be involved on the $250 policies. The
first premium will amount to $11.43, the
second $10.55, the third $10.48, and so
on, making the average to be paid about
$10 annually.
The fund thus raised will be used in
the following way: One-third will be
used to establish scholarships to be
awarded on the basis of participation in
college activities and the needs of the
student. To qualify for such a scholar
ship all that will be necessary will be
that a "C" average be maintained by the
student.
The remaining two-thirds will be
turned over to the University to be used
at 1 the discretion of the president's office
on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
class of '21.
