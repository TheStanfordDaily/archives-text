# AMENDMENTS PASS BY LARGE VOTE AT STUDENT ELECTION
## Changes Are Made in Makeup of Men's Council and Daily Palo Alto Organization 
### 
Both amendments to the A. S. S. U.
Constitution, voted on in Quad election
held today were carried, the amend
ment providing for changes in,the or
ganization of the Daily Palo Alto by
a vote of 193 to 46, and that for a
change in the makeup of the Men's
Council, by a vote of 108 to 11.
According to the Daily Palo Alto
amendment an advisory committee
will be appointed, whose duty it will
be to work in co-operation with the
editorial and managerial departments
and with the executive committee.
The provision states that this com
mittee is to be composed of students
having had some newspaper experi
ence, but who shall not have had any
connection with the Daily Palo Alto
for at least three months prior to their
appointment. Their powers will be
limited to advisory recommendations
and they are to keep in touch with
the administration of the Daily.
The amendment also provides for
a change in the methods of voting
for editor of the Daily. Preference
will now be by seniority rather than
by staff rating.
Menss Council membership will be
slightly changed as a rsult of the pass
age of the amendment, which provides
for a substitution of sections in the
constitution of the Men's Council for
Student Control. Juniors will in the
future be given a representation on
the Board at mid-year elections and
their term of office will be carried over
to the middle term in the following
year. In this way the entire member
ship of the Council will not change at
one time, as has been the case
