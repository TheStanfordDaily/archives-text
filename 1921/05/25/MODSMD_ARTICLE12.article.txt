Stanford will have its football stadium
seating 60,000 spectators ready for use
for the next Big Game with the Uni
versity of California in November of
this year. All plans for construction
and for financing under the arrangement
already announced of subscriptions en
titling the donor to reserved seat privi
leges for ten years have been settled,
the contract has been let, and the con
tractors began actual work on the ground
today.
The contract for building the bowl
has been awarded to Palmer & Mcßryde,
of San Francisco, acting under the direc
tion of Baker & Carpenter, the engineer
ing experts employed by the Board of

Athletic Control, and they are today
staking out the building for their labor
camp. It is planned to have ground

and the work of excavating will be
driven through without delay until the
completed structure with its turf field
twenty-three feet below the ground level
and its great sweeps of encircling seats
is ready for the Big Game No

alumni were urged not only to contribute
promptly, themselves, but to redouble

the money may be in hand from these
subscriptions to meet all payments as

will donate to the stadium 10 per cent of
their fees.
Palmer & Mcßryde, who will do the
construction work, are one of the biggest
firms of dirt removers in the West. They
built the Western Pacific Railroad. Mr.
Mvßryde lives in Redwood City and has
a personal interest in the success of the
Stanford project. His firm was very
much the lowest bidder of all who sub
mitted bids. The total cost of the com
pleted stadium will come within the
$210,000 which lias been estimated as the
approximate cost of the football stadium
as an earth embankment with wooden
seats.
The contract for the excavation of
230,000 cubic yards of earth under
Palmer & Mcßryde's bid, covers the ex
cavation, the lumber used in the con
struction, the building of the seats and
putting in of necessary curbs, the laying
of water pipes and the-building of fences
surrounding the enclosure. It does not
include the building of the cinder track
nor the laying of the turf on the playing
field, nor the ornamental planting.
