received with enthusiasm by those,
present and the entire meeting was
a success to the point of a reliable
indication that the San Francisco
campaign will ge through in record
breaking fashion and bring the desired
support. The room was decorated
with large Stanford banners and en
tertainment was furnished by the
Stanford Glee Club Quartet, and Harry
for borrowing up to $100,000 to provide
emergency funds to meet these later
payments as they fall due, if that should
prove necessary. Every effort will be
marie, however, to collect subscriptions
rapidly enough t<» meet all payments on
time froni that source.
