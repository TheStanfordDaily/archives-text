# THE BOARD OF CONTROL MOVES

A compjete stadium for over 60,000 spectators ready for the Big
Game next November will be at least one year ahead of the schedule
(hat has been in the minds of our greatest student optimists. The Cali
fornia-Stanford contest of next fall undoubtedly will provide the great
est football spectacle the West has ever seen.
Students had hoped for a stadium in two years. We will have by
far the largest on the Coast and one of the greatest in the nation in less
than one year. The rapid advance in the plans of the big bowl has been
made possible by active co-operation of alumni, faculty, and students.
One of the greatest factors in the development of the plans was the
endeavor and ability of the older members of the Hoard of Athletic Con
trol, who have for some time been neglecting their own business in the
interest of Stanford athletics. The difficult task in connection with
financing the project was left almost entirely to Mr. Leland Cutler of
San Francisco, to whom in particular credit must be extended.
The Stanford bowl will be unique in type, probably the only one of
its kind. The sunken field and embankment plan is attracting attention
throughout the country because of the decreased cost of building, and
because of a freedom from certain prominent defects in the heavy con
crete stadium which is found to give trouble in sinking. Eastern com
mentators are wondering why this type of bowl with its obvious advan
tages has not been more extensively tried. It of course requires a large
site that cannot be afforded by any but a spacious campus such as we
have here. The Hoard of Control and the engineers who have co-oper
ated with it, Professors C. D. Marx, W. ~l\ Durand, and C. H. Wing,
deserve right honorable mention as promoters of the new scheme, with
out which our discussion of a Stanford stadium probably still would be
within the realm of conjecture alone.
