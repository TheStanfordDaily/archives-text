# WHAT ARE THE SENIORS DOING?
## 
### 
First reports of the senior endowment committee indicate excellent
■success for this early stage in the senior campaign. The favorable atti
tude met with makes it not at all improbable that a mark between $60,000
and $75,000 in total policies written or contracted for may be reached.
The seniors who have studied the situation show that the plan is the
easiest known for returning- a substantial gift to the University at our
twenty-fifth anniversary, as it includes every member of the class equally
and requires only a very moderate outlay on the part of each.
Two-thirds of the total return will go directly to the University to be
used as best it may. The other third the seniors desire to be used in the
establishment of the kind of a scholarship that will help the really needv
student through college. Practically all scholarships art' now awarded
only to those with very high standing. It is the opinion of the seniors
that many men who are forced to work their way through college are
never able to give sufficient amount of time to studies to acquire a com
paratively high standing, while they are yet the men who are actually
in need of assistance. The seniors plan to have scholarships awarded to
men "A." "1.J," or "C" standing. Presumably any one with a "C" or
better average may apply for the new type of scholarship, and it will be
awarded to the man who shows the greatest need of assistance. In this
way many who have been required to spend all outside hours working
will be able to devote more time to study, and the general scholastic
average should be raised. In addition such a student mav then find some
time also for college activity.
The greatest accomplishment the seniors hope to achieve is the firm
establishment of the precedent initiated last year, that of the endowment
plan in substantial form. Ihe plan, it it includes a majority of the seni
ors, will in the course of years be of great aid to the future administra
tion. luirther, it will make of every senior who participates in it an
actual supporter of his University, whose interest in Stanford should be
just a little stronger as the years roll along, ft will eventually be one
of the greatest factors in a powerful pro-Stanford alumni spirit.

A ShNIOR CLASS MKETJNG is called for tomorrow at 12:30 in the
Women's Clubhouse. The seniors are not in debt, so the purpose is
undoubtedly not to raise money for the payment of old obligations. With
this traditional idea disposed of, and also since a central location has been
selected, the members of 1921 ought to be able to turn out and get avvav
Irom the old and dead atmosphere in which many classes have finished.
