# Chester Rowell Says Railroad Regulatory Method is on Trail
## 
### Wylie Kilpatrick, '23 
"The present tendency is toward gov
ernment ownership of public utilities,"
was the answer of Chester H. Rowell in
a recent interview, to the question as to
whether regulation was the solvent of
the utilities question. The statement of
Mr. Rowell, surprising because of his
membership on the California Railroad
Commission, revealed a critical attitude
toward both regulation and ownership
as permanent devices in dealing with
utilities.
"There is no fundamental reason why
democracy is not adequate to capably
own and manage utilities." asserted the
railroad commissioner, "but ours has
not shown itself capable except in the
cities'." The regulation of utilities
through commissions is still in the ex
perimental stage, in his opinion, and not
until further test has been made should
we abandon the experiment. "Sidney
Brooks once told ine," he commented,
"that 'the one vital contribution of
America to political science was the
regulatory method of handling utilities.'
Let us determine the truth of that com
pliment by experience."
Veteran progressive politician, Rowell

was hesitant in expressing an opinion as
to factional fights in the Republican
party. "Will there be a split in the G. O.
P.?" he was asked. "Never on abstract
ideas," was his reply, "hut very possibly
a concrete question of actual policy may
re-align the party into two groups. All
the fundamentals for a split are present.
Everything is needed but the bump."
That the irreconcilables and those fa
voring a league are both struggling to
capture President Harding is evident,
according to the railroad commissioner.
"1 have perfectly reliable information
from both camps that he fully acquiesces
in the views of both factions. Needless
to say, I hope to see the irreconcilables
disappointed."
Hoover, Hughes, and Mellon form an
unusually strong trio of cabinet officers,
in Rowell's opinion. If foreign affairs,
finance, anil commercial rehabilitation
are ably conducted under these officers
the Harding administration will gain the
country's confidence. If a true cabinet
system were formulated instead of the
present makeshift of a conference of
departmental chiefs, Rowell believes that
Harding's administrative troubles would
be greatly minimized.
