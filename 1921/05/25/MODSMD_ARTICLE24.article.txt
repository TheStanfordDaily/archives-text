The Gentleman Crook Again
I Overlook a few improbabilities and
you will find "My La<Jy's Latchkey"
good entertainment. Katherine Mac-
Donald is the star of this picture down
at the Stanford, and her beauty and
ability ormament some rather surpris
ing situations.
For instance, an American crook
induces an English gentlewoman to
pose as his wife and later marry him.
j All of this happens at their very first
i meeting and he doesn't even kiss her
| until after they are married. Shades
iof Robert W. Chambers and Elinor
■ Gl.vn! That surely blasts the Sun
' day supplement idea of romance, but
don't worry about it. Watch the pic
j tare and s£e what a inixup it gets
i them into.
The Other Side of Love
A picture that lives up to its title
—such is "Sacred and Profane Love."
This photoplay down at the Varsity in
which Elsie Ferguson is starred, leaves
little to the imagination in its por
trayal of the two species affection.
Arnold Bennett may pat himself on
the back with the assurance that none
of the blunt realism of his novel and
I play has been lost in the screen pro
j duet ion.
The story duals with the seduction
;of an innocent girl by a combined
musical genius and absinthe fiend and
her subsequent finding of pure love
through hSr efforts to rform him.
Conrad Nagle's acting in the part of
the fiend is a powerful piece of work.
Explaining a Queen
New York had a right to expect
something noteablfe from the author of
"Abraham Lincoln." Whether or not
it got it is another question, but at
least Mr. John Drinkwater's latest
play. "Mary Stuart" is one of the most
midely discussed attractions now on
Broadway.
The drama presents a picture of the
ill-starred Mary Queen of Scots not
primarily as a sovereign of England
but as one of the world's great lovers.
Seeing in Mary a woman capable ni
the highest degree of the "grand pas
sion" but thwarted by wasting it on
her ministers, Parnley, lUccio, and
Boothwell, Drinkwater uses this situa
tion to explain tin.' erratic official nets
of the Queen.
Certainly an interesting theme, and
no one disputes the literary quality
of the play. But as to whether it pre
•ents a true picture of the unhappy
Mary, and as to whether it has merit
as a picture of dramatic construc
tion (the piece is in a short prologue
and then one continuous act which
runs for an hour and a half), discus
sion is raging from one end of Broad
way to the other.
