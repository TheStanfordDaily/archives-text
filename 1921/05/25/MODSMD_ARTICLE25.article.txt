# Remarkable Collection Of Pottery Exhibited
## 
### 
A fine collection of the pottery made
by the best modern potters of Mexico is
proving of interest to those who have
visited the Maya-Aztec and Applied Art
Exhibit, at the Art Gallery. The glazed
ware is effectively arranged in a case
which bears comments on the history of
this "old yet fver new art." The As
syrians and Persians glazed tiles and
pottery many years ago. Then their
skill was imitated by Arabs, who took
their wares to Morocco and Spain. At

the latter place the name of the place of
manufacture became also that of the
pottery. It was called Talavera. In tlu*
sixteenth century the Mexicans of
Puebla were making it. Before that
time the unglazed burnished ware wa>
the only kind known. The Macolican
glazed work shows foreign influence al
though it retains many original traces
of native Mexican artist y. The designs
are in monochrome and polychrome, and
the flower and animal motifs are very
effective 011 tlu- yellow pottery wliich is
largely the work of the Maestro family,
whose ancestors frrst introduced this art.
