# Owens Returns to Campus After Practicing Law and Aiding Food Regulation
## 
### 
William Brownlee Owens, Associate
Professor in the Law Department, says
that being a professor at Stanford is the
only inducement which could keep him
from the private practice of law.
Professor pwens received his LL. B.
from Stanford in 1915 and remained
here as an instructor in the Law De
partment during the year 1915-16. He
then left Stanford and went to Fresno
to practice law, but in a short time he
transferred to Los Angeles. Tn both
places he was practicing with former
Stanford graduates.
It was while he was in Los Angeles
that the war broke out. In July, 1917, he
joined the legal staff of the United
States Food Administration under Her
bert Hoover. For a few months he
worked directly under Judge Curtis H.
Lindley of San Francisco. With the
passage of the food control law, he was
put in charge of the license division of
the food administration. This law ne
cessitated the licensing of food dealers,
manufacturers of foodstuffs and others
engaged in the distribution of food
products. He had only a week to or
ganize this department and start its
work. Some of its duties were the
licensing of many thousands of firms
and individuals, keeping records and
liles of these licenses, making rules and
regulations and interpreting them in each
special case. This involved a large
amount of correspondence and inquiries.
At the outset, this division had fifty
workers, but the number soon grew to
four hundred. The offices of the depart
ment were moved three times, until they
finally occupied the large part of a
special building which covered an entire
block.
In connection with the license depart
ment of which Professor Owens was in
charge, there was a report division
whose duty it was to keep reports from
the licensees as to their sales and prices.
A large amount of tabulation and work
in statistics was involved in both of
these sections. It was soon found that
they were duplicating each other's work
and orders were issued for them to be

consolidated. Professor Owens took
charge of this task and cut down the
staffs of both departments until, after
the reorganization, there were only three
hundred and fifty workers where there
had been seven hundred before. A short
time after this the armistice was signed.
Rapid disorganization began and by Feb
ruary, 1919, Professor Owens bad com
pletely dissolved his department and re
turned to Los Angeles.
Professor Owens re-entered private
practice with the Title Insurance and
Trust Company of Los Angeles, his ca
pacity there being partly legal and partly
administrative in connection with the
management of properties and adminis
tration of estates. He remained there
until last spring quarter, when he came
to Stanford.
In the Law Department his special
field is in California practice and com
mercial law subjects. He gives courses
in California practice, a business law
course for students who are not law
majors, personal property, partnership,
and Moot Court.
While he was in college Professor
Owens was prominent in campus dra
matics, and was a member of Sword and
Sandals. He took part in intercollegiate
debates and belongs to Delta Sigma Rho.
He was a member of the Quadrangle
Club and was a Delta Chi.

only inducement which could keep him
from the private practice of law.
Professor pwens received his LL. B.
from Stanford in 1915 and remained
here as an instructor in the Law De
partment during the year 1915-16. He
then left Stanford and went to Fresno
to practice law, but in a short time he
transferred to Los Angeles. Tn both
places he was practicing with former
Stanford graduates.
It was while he was in Los Angeles
that the war broke out. In July, 1917, he
joined the legal staff of the United
States Food Administration under Her
bert Hoover. For a few months he
worked directly under Judge Curtis H.
Lindley of San Francisco. With the
passage of the food control law, he was
put in charge of the license division of
the food administration. This law ne
cessitated the licensing of food dealers,
manufacturers of foodstuffs and others
engaged in the distribution of food
products. He had only a week to or
ganize this department and start its
work. Some of its duties were the
licensing of many thousands of firms
and individuals, keeping records and
liles of these licenses, making rules and
regulations and interpreting them in each
special case. This involved a large
amount of correspondence and inquiries.
At the outset, this division had fifty
workers, but the number soon grew to
four hundred. The offices of the depart
ment were moved three times, until they
finally occupied the large part of a
special building which covered an entire
block.
In connection with the license depart
ment of which Professor Owens was in
charge, there was a report division
whose duty it was to keep reports from
the licensees as to their sales and prices.
A large amount of tabulation and work
in statistics was involved in both of
these sections. It was soon found that
they were duplicating each other's work
and orders were issued for them to be

consolidated. Professor Owens took
charge of this task and cut down the
staffs of both departments until, after
the reorganization, there were only three
hundred and fifty workers where there
had been seven hundred before. A short
time after this the armistice was signed.
Rapid disorganization began and by Feb
ruary, 1919, Professor Owens bad com
pletely dissolved his department and re
turned to Los Angeles.
Professor Owens re-entered private
practice with the Title Insurance and
Trust Company of Los Angeles, his ca
pacity there being partly legal and partly
administrative in connection with the
management of properties and adminis
tration of estates. He remained there
until last spring quarter, when he came
to Stanford.
In the Law Department his special
field is in California practice and com
mercial law subjects. He gives courses
in California practice, a business law
course for students who are not law
majors, personal property, partnership,
and Moot Court.
While he was in college Professor
Owens was prominent in campus dra
matics, and was a member of Sword and
Sandals. He took part in intercollegiate
debates and belongs to Delta Sigma Rho.
He was a member of the Quadrangle
Club and was a Delta Chi.
William Brownlee Owens, Associate
Professor in the Law Department, says
that being a professor at Stanford is the
only inducement which could keep him
from the private practice of law.
