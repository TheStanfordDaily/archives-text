Most fittingly on Memorial Day and
Memorial Sunday, we shall turn our
thoughts to those who suffered and those
who lost their lives in the war. The
thirtieth of May is set apart in nearly
all of the Northern and Western states
as a legal holiday for the purpose of
commemorating the soldiers who fell in
the Civil War, and decorating it heir
graves. The Southern states celebrate
their Confederate Memorial days at
various other times. In all the states,
however, there is the common purpose,
to recall and celebrate the memory of
men who lost their lives in the Civil
War. Hut the War of Nations has
again extended the meaning of Memorial
Day; it has become a day of truer na
tionalism, for there was no division of
the states in this last struggle.
How should Memorial Day he cele
brated? What would be the answer of
those who died in the Argonne or in
Flanders'? It is for them we celebrate:
therefore, their wishes should be our
desires. We shall recall them to mind,
we shall recall what they did, we shall
decorate their graves. Would that fulfill
the wishes of those whose names we
honor? What were the last wishes of
these men .' To what purpose would
they have wished a national day, set
apart in their honor, to he devoted?
Would bare praise and hero worship
have satisfied their last wishes?
In every heart there were hopes that
that humanly-created hell—war, was re
ceiving its last tribute: that its gluttony
would soon be satiated; that their dear
ones would not have to suffer as they
had suffered; that in some way that
Brotherhood of Man. which Christ
taught, would some day be realized. But
how can we aid such hopes, and hasten
the time when such hopes will he more
than the futile dreams of idealists? To
this there is no mathematical answer. It
| is the problem of humanity: it is not for
■ one man to answer. I cannot say that
there is no answer, for the treasures of
the human mind and the human heart
have never been sounded.
To lend a constructive and tangible
aspect to our honor of these men, let
us turn our thoughts to the cause of the
loss of these sixty-eight thousand lives
of our own people, and to the cause of
the loss of the lives of over seven and
one-half millions of men in all countries.
A whole nation devoting itself to such
considerations cannot but bear fruit. Let
our Memorial Day be more than a re
calling of these men and their deeds, and
a decorating of their graves; let us give
our thoughts to what they would wish,
to what anyone would wish who had
lived through such a struggle. Recollec
tions and praise are empty as compared
with the honor of a whole nation de
voting its thoughts on one day each year
to the proposition that it shall not hap
pen again. C. VICTOR SMITH, 19.
