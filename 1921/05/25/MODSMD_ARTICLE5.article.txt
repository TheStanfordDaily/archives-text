# W.A.A. 10 ADOPT NEW POINT SYSTEM
## Officers for Coming Year to Be Balloted on at Student Body Election Next Week 
### 
A point system for the awarding of
block letters for women's athletics to go
into effect next year was adopted to re
place the old system of awards at a
meeting of the Women's Athletic Asso
ciation last night. This new system
quires that 000 points be made in order
to win a block letter, and that a star
shall be awarded for each succeeding let
ter won. It is similar in nature and re
quirements to the point systems adopted
by other colleges whose women's ath
letic associations are members of the
national organization and makes it pos
sible for any woman to transfer her
puipts toward a block letter of another
institution. -
Under the new ruling 100 points will
be awarded for membership on a class
team and 100 points extra for all-star
teams. Members of squads and substi
tutes on teams will also be awarded
points. This will make it possible for
those who have come out and made six
class teams to achieve their letter.
There will be no change in the method
of awarding numerals. These will still
be granted to those who are members of
class teams.
Nominations for the board for the
coming year were presented by the nomi
nating committee. The nominees have
been selected because of their interest in
women's athletics as well as for their
executive ability. They will be elected
by popular vote at the regular quad elec
tion next week.
