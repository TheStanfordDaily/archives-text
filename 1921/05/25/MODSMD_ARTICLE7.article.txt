# UNIVERSITY WAYS AND IDEALS FORM TOPIC OF LECTURE
## Reverend W. L. Sperry Talks On Methods of Schools In England and America 
### 
''Cart you think on the ground? If
you learn how to think, it does not
matter what grindstone your brain is
sharpened on. It does not matter
what courses you take so long is you
learn how to use your mind," said
Rev. Willard Sperry, last night, in his
lecture on English and American Uni
versity methods and Ideals.
Rev. Sperry told about Oxford from
his personal experiences there for
three years and explained its tutorial
system under which each professor,
no matter how high he stands in the
professional ranks, and each in
structor, has a special student whom
he looks after and advices.
"There are two theories of educa
tion," said Rev. Sperry. "According
to one, a student goes to college and
is given concentrated facts for four
years and he hopes they will stand by
him to meet any problem that may
come up in his life. Under the other
conception of an education, a student
is not supplies with facts, but is
taught to use his mind and think for
himself. In America we spend too
much time trying to inform students.
Tli Oxford honor courses are designed
to make the men think indepndently,
and are something like the work that
the student in America does when he
is working for his Master's or Doctor's
degree. When the Oxford men come
up for graduation there are great gaps
about which they are curiously unin
formed, according to our* ideas, but
they have wonderfully alert minds.
Which will be the most useful in life,
a mind well stocked with second-hand
information or a mind well equipped
for work? A balance must be struck
somewhere.',,' 0
Rev. Sperry arrived at the conclu
sion that the alert mind that will cut
is the one that will bring the student
to success in life. "It is a moral
weapon that be can command. The
introduction of courses that will train
th mind would be a correction for the
one-sidedness of many of our universi
ties," were his closing words.
