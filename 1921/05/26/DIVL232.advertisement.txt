GIFTS
Graduation time is almost here, and with it the
gift puzzle.
Gifts that express the thoughtfulness of the giver
are those that embody usefulness and taste —the
kind that the graduate can derive real benefit from
in the months and years to come. —We suggest:
S Kodaks Military Brushes
Fountain Pens Shaving Sets and Safety
H Eversharp and Sheaffer Pencils Razor Sets
1371 Leather Rollups Manicure Sets
Stationery
Ivory Pyralin
Sj A gift of lasting beauty in complete sets or in single
S pieces, easy to match at any time.
g Toilet Sets
S Various combinations of perfumes, toilet waters, face
S powders, talcum powders, soaps and
g perfume bottles.
Our stock of useful and pleasing remembrances is now on dis- (
play—at prices that surprise even those who knew our record for
g selling quality goods at low prices.
