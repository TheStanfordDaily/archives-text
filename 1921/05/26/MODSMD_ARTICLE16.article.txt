# UNHERALDED SCHOLARSHIPS
## 
### 
We have heard a great deal of the various types of scholarships
offered in the different eastern universities. ()ne highly favored device
tor student assistance is the loan scholarship plan, by which money is
advanced students of certain scholastic qualification with the understand
ing' that it shall be repaid within a five- or ten-year period. In this way
many students who have attained sufficiently high-grade records are
able to overcome in a measure the heavy burden of tuition.
Stanford University has never advertised any kind of tuition schol
arship. Yet a hundred or more are granted in the form of tuition notes
each year by the University itself. In other words, the type of assist
ance described by the term scholarship in many colleges is awarded Stan
lord students under the less attractive name of tuition notes.
I<ul there is a great difference between our own and the regular
eastern plan. The commendable attribute of the Stanford tuition note
holarship is tlicit it is not granted on any consideration of exceptional
scholastic record. A student who desires one need not first surpass in
grade points a number of his classmates, lie need onlv show that he
is actually in need of outside assistance.
Stanford, then, without advertising the fact and without the reali
zation of many of its students, is awarding to every man who needs one
a loan scholarship of $120 each year.

MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS are to be congratu
lated on passing both the Men's Council and Daily Palo Alto amend
ments yesterday. The returns, however, were small, and there are stu
dents who would decrt a lack of interest.* When propositions are so
obviously beneficial as not to excite opposition, it is hardly to be expected
that they will incite on the other hand a tremendous enthusiasm that
would bring the.students out in a great body to vote for them.
