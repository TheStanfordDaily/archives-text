# BREAKERS NINE LOSES TO PHI DELTA THETAS
## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta diamond men de
feated the Breakers' nine yesterday
in the first round of the championship
series. The losers were allowed only
one consolation tally, while the Phi
Delta Theta batsmen fattened their
averages and piled up a sixteen-run
score. Clark, star twirler of the win
ners, pitched a delivery which only one
batter found for a real hit. Templeton
clouted out a bona-flde bingle in the
final inning. Trace heaved a good
brand of ball for the Breakers, strik
ing out six men, but received poor
support from his teammates. Clark
fanned ten batters. The leading
sluggers on the Phi Delt squad were
Carter, Whittemore, and Piggott.
Carter heads the list with two triple
baggers. Whittemore whacked out a
pair of doubles, and Piggott connected
for three singles. In all the victors
made fourteen hits.
Whittemore was the first runner to
score when he went home on a catch
er's over-throw to second. Piggott
jingled and Miller reached first 011 an
error by shortstop. Both men were
brought in by Carter's three-bagger.
The Breakers' first three stickers
waved the willow wand three times in
vain and retired their side. In the
second frame the Phi Delta Theta
players made three hits. However,
the opposing fielders booted grounders
and dropped flies five times, allowing
six runs to be made. The losers' lone
tally was hung up in the last half of
the inning when Trace received a base
on balls and scored from second on a
long fly by Templeton which wa3
muffed by the left fielder. During the
third period, the Breakers aggregation
put over a little surprise, in that the
Phi Delt Batters were forced to get
three good hits in order to convert two
runs. Clark singled and spiked the
home platter on Whittemore's double.
Piggott sent in Whittemore. The
strikeouts featured Clark's following
work on the mound. In the fourth
inning the winners' batting staff took
the count one, two, three, for the only
time during the game. Five runs were
earned by Phi Delta Theta from as
many hits in the last two frames.'
Piggott and Whittemore found Trace
for a two-bagger.
El Cuadro and Alpha Chi Sigma
played a close contest which the form
er won nine to seven. Purdy and
Neer scored for El Cuadro in the first
period on two hits and an error. Dur
ing their next two trips to the plate
the Alpha Chi Sigma men circled the
bases three times. El Cuadro over
came this lead in the last of the third.
Robinson hit to right field and brought
in Seymour tieing the score. Neer
singled, sending home Robinson. The
losers evened matters in the fourth
when Demond got a bingle and enabled
McDermott to reach the home base.
El Cuadro staged a small marathon
in the fifth frame, making five runs.
Several bases on errors plus a pair of
two-base hits by Purdy and Mills both
of which were stretched into triples,
accounted for the rally. In the same
inning Purdy, El Cuadro pitcher, walk
ed the first four batters and was re
placed by Robinson. Aspinwall hit
through shortstop scoring three run
ners. Neither side crossed the home
platter in the final two innings.

Phi Delta Theta diamond men de
feated the Breakers' nine yesterday
in the first round of the championship
series. The losers were allowed only
one consolation tally, while the Phi
Delta Theta batsmen fattened their
averages and piled up a sixteen-run
score. Clark, star twirler of the win
ners, pitched a delivery which only one
batter found for a real hit. Templeton
clouted out a bona-flde bingle in the
final inning. Trace heaved a good
brand of ball for the Breakers, strik
ing out six men, but received poor
support from his teammates. Clark
fanned ten batters. The leading
sluggers on the Phi Delt squad were
Carter, Whittemore, and Piggott.
Carter heads the list with two triple
baggers. Whittemore whacked out a
pair of doubles, and Piggott connected
for three singles. In all the victors
made fourteen hits.
Whittemore was the first runner to
score when he went home on a catch
er's over-throw to second. Piggott
jingled and Miller reached first 011 an
error by shortstop. Both men were
brought in by Carter's three-bagger.
The Breakers' first three stickers
waved the willow wand three times in
vain and retired their side. In the
second frame the Phi Delta Theta
players made three hits. However,
the opposing fielders booted grounders
and dropped flies five times, allowing
six runs to be made. The losers' lone
tally was hung up in the last half of
the inning when Trace received a base
on balls and scored from second on a
long fly by Templeton which wa3
muffed by the left fielder. During the
third period, the Breakers aggregation
put over a little surprise, in that the
Phi Delt Batters were forced to get
three good hits in order to convert two
runs. Clark singled and spiked the
home platter on Whittemore's double.
Piggott sent in Whittemore. The
strikeouts featured Clark's following
work on the mound. In the fourth
inning the winners' batting staff took
the count one, two, three, for the only
time during the game. Five runs were
earned by Phi Delta Theta from as
many hits in the last two frames.'
Piggott and Whittemore found Trace
for a two-bagger.
El Cuadro and Alpha Chi Sigma
played a close contest which the form
er won nine to seven. Purdy and
Neer scored for El Cuadro in the first
period on two hits and an error. Dur
ing their next two trips to the plate
the Alpha Chi Sigma men circled the
bases three times. El Cuadro over
came this lead in the last of the third.
Robinson hit to right field and brought
in Seymour tieing the score. Neer
singled, sending home Robinson. The
losers evened matters in the fourth
when Demond got a bingle and enabled
McDermott to reach the home base.
El Cuadro staged a small marathon
in the fifth frame, making five runs.
Several bases on errors plus a pair of
two-base hits by Purdy and Mills both
of which were stretched into triples,
accounted for the rally. In the same
inning Purdy, El Cuadro pitcher, walk
ed the first four batters and was re
placed by Robinson. Aspinwall hit
through shortstop scoring three run
ners. Neither side crossed the home
platter in the final two innings.

Phi Delta Theta diamond men de
feated the Breakers' nine yesterday
in the first round of the championship
series. The losers were allowed only
one consolation tally, while the Phi
Delta Theta batsmen fattened their
averages and piled up a sixteen-run
score. Clark, star twirler of the win
ners, pitched a delivery which only one
batter found for a real hit. Templeton
clouted out a bona-flde bingle in the
final inning. Trace heaved a good
brand of ball for the Breakers, strik
ing out six men, but received poor
support from his teammates. Clark
fanned ten batters. The leading
sluggers on the Phi Delt squad were
Carter, Whittemore, and Piggott.
Carter heads the list with two triple
baggers. Whittemore whacked out a
pair of doubles, and Piggott connected
for three singles. In all the victors
made fourteen hits.
Whittemore was the first runner to
score when he went home on a catch
er's over-throw to second. Piggott
jingled and Miller reached first 011 an
error by shortstop. Both men were
brought in by Carter's three-bagger.
The Breakers' first three stickers
waved the willow wand three times in
vain and retired their side. In the
second frame the Phi Delta Theta
players made three hits. However,
the opposing fielders booted grounders
and dropped flies five times, allowing
six runs to be made. The losers' lone
tally was hung up in the last half of
the inning when Trace received a base
on balls and scored from second on a
long fly by Templeton which wa3
muffed by the left fielder. During the
third period, the Breakers aggregation
put over a little surprise, in that the
Phi Delt Batters were forced to get
three good hits in order to convert two
runs. Clark singled and spiked the
home platter on Whittemore's double.
Piggott sent in Whittemore. The
strikeouts featured Clark's following
work on the mound. In the fourth
inning the winners' batting staff took
the count one, two, three, for the only
time during the game. Five runs were
earned by Phi Delta Theta from as
many hits in the last two frames.'
Piggott and Whittemore found Trace
for a two-bagger.
El Cuadro and Alpha Chi Sigma
played a close contest which the form
er won nine to seven. Purdy and
Neer scored for El Cuadro in the first
period on two hits and an error. Dur
ing their next two trips to the plate
the Alpha Chi Sigma men circled the
bases three times. El Cuadro over
came this lead in the last of the third.
Robinson hit to right field and brought
in Seymour tieing the score. Neer
singled, sending home Robinson. The
losers evened matters in the fourth
when Demond got a bingle and enabled
McDermott to reach the home base.
El Cuadro staged a small marathon
in the fifth frame, making five runs.
Several bases on errors plus a pair of
two-base hits by Purdy and Mills both
of which were stretched into triples,
accounted for the rally. In the same
inning Purdy, El Cuadro pitcher, walk
ed the first four batters and was re
placed by Robinson. Aspinwall hit
through shortstop scoring three run
ners. Neither side crossed the home
platter in the final two innings.
