# BREAKERS NINE LOSES TO PHI DELTA THETAS
## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta diamond men de
feated the Breakers' nine yesterday
in the first round of the championship
series. The losers were allowed only
one consolation tally, while the Phi
Delta Theta batsmen fattened their
averages and piled up a sixteen-run
score. Clark, star twirler of the win
ners, pitched a delivery which only one
batter found for a real hit. Templeton
clouted out a bona-flde bingle in the
final inning. Trace heaved a good
brand of ball for the Breakers, strik
ing out six men, but received poor
support from his teammates. Clark
fanned ten batters. The leading
sluggers on the Phi Delt squad were
Carter, Whittemore, and Piggott.
Carter heads the list with two triple
baggers. Whittemore whacked out a
pair of doubles, and Piggott connected
for three singles. In all the victors
made fourteen hits.
Whittemore was the first runner to
score when he went home on a catch
er's over-throw to second. Piggott
jingled and Miller reached first 011 an
error by shortstop. Both men were
brought in by Carter's three-bagger.
The Breakers' first three stickers
waved the willow wand three times in
vain and retired their side. In the
second frame the Phi Delta Theta
players made three hits. However,
the opposing fielders booted grounders
and dropped flies five times, allowing
six runs to be made. The losers' lone
tally was hung up in the last half of
the inning when Trace received a base
on balls and scored from second on a
long fly by Templeton which wa3
muffed by the left fielder. During the
