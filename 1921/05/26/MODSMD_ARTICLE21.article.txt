Not because we're an information
bureau is the following news imparted,
but bcuuse interested parties are curi
ous why the roads were roped off the j
other day. Campus officials announce f
that the practice is resorted to once !
a year to keep campus roads private •
thoroughfares, but some people seem i
t othink the Pinsillar U. R. Co. does '
it to make people ride the Yellow I
Peril. At any rate, it's a good stab j
at temporary monopoly.
* *r. *
In support of the radical stand!
against war tax, we suggest that the |
cash turned in from sales of liquor
runners' cars might eliminate the [
necessity of a levy. We don't mean to j
support the confiscation of the bars,!

Speaking of it is easy
to agree with the Prof, who in a
demonstration in class the other day, j
was heard to remark to a student,}
"Now when I look at your head with
one eye, I see a disc and when I look
at it with the other eye, I see another
i
disc, thus pcoducing a sense of solidity j
by looking at your head from two j
sides."

One of these days, the women «wre
goin' to hang out the "Daily" shingle
and give fhe boys a ride for their
money. We're thankful for a later
opportunity for a comeback. After

column is open to retaliatory matter.

supposed to be a joke. Said contri
butor turned in a purposedly foolish
headline and thought it was supposed
to be serious.
