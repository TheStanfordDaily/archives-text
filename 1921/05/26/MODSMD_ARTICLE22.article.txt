# RENAISSANCE CLUB TO PRESENT FRENCH PLAY THIS EVENING
## 
### 
Anna Judge, *22, will assume the
role of Elmire in tonight's production
of "Tartuffe," in the Little Theatre.
This part when first given in 1667, was
played by Moliere's young and lovely
wife, Madelaine Bejert. Moliere play
ed the role of the injured and jealous
husband himself. Orgon, the husband,
is played by Herman Van Polen in the
present production.
When "Tartuffe" was first presented
before Louis the Magnificent in his
private theatre at Versailles, the
Grand Monarch was deeply shocked,
ordered the immediate suppression of
the piece. Its bold treatment' of re
ligious hycocrisy a# the time was con
sidered extremely radical, and Moliere
was forced to rewrite parts of the
play before its second production in
Paris in 1667.
This production is the fifth Little
Theatre performance which the Re
naissance players have given us this
year, free of charge. It is the purpose
of the Club to study the older forms
of drama and to awaken interest in
the revival. The plays have been well
received and the Club feels encourag
ed to attempt in "Tartuffe" a more
ambitious production.
