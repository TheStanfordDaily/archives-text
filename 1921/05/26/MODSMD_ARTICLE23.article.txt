Editor Daily Palo Alto, Dear Sir. —
Whither are we drifting.* brethren?
Pass the plate. Ye gods of the Paddle,
I Tub and Maytteld Trough, what kind |
of a dairy lunch are these four and I
! twenty gents trying to make out of
j the famous old Farm? Twenty-three j
j starts the heresy by sloughing off the :
I wonderful old red bonnet that matched !
the Kampus Kar in favor of a—tweed
is it, quite correct, you know, in our
best circles —and now these degener- j
| ate frosli esthetically vote for white
j soph hats—with a "thin" red band!!!
! "Thin" is it? —all that is red, Stan- i
I ford's one and only color. All that is 1
left of the Cardinal red, the fire-bucket j
red, the hell-popping red that grew
011 the Farm. White —that color of |
i Palm Beach, of Newport, of Sunday I
I School dresses newly laundered, milk
shakes and snakes' bellies. Give me !
Red, as Eugene Field wrote, the color j
of the West, any color as long as it's
red. More red. gents, sunset fires, j
red-tiled roofs, red-blooded sons of
gamboliers, red on the football field
, and red tire buring from the goal posts
after the battle. Come on, lied! This
j White- inanity is getting worse. Give !
! it enough room and it'll represent a !
; new Stanford, not a hard-hitting Farm, j
gents, but of the millionaires they pre
dict for us, and the grand old Farm ;
will be a Great White Way. Pass the
catsup!—S. G. T., '22.
