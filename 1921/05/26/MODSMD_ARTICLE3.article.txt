# SENIOR ENDOWMENT REACHES $28,000 ON SECOND DRIVE DAY
## Reports From Women Are Coming In Slowly and Returns From Many Living Groups Incomplete 
### 
With incomplete returns from many
of the campus organizations on the re
sults of the senior endowment, it is
found that over $28,(XX) has been already
subscribed to the fund. This amount
has actually been signed for. It is ex
pected by the committee in charge of
collecting the senior pledges that well
over $33,000 will be subscribed, signed
for and in the hands of the drive com
mittee before the end of this week.
During the week-end there will be let
ters sent to about 100 members of the
class who are not now in the University
but have either graduated during the

year or have taken out leave for one
reason or another. It is confidently ex
pected that subscriptions will amount to
around $8(X)0 or $9000 from these people
to be circularized.
From the groups that have turned in
complete lists of the contributors to the
fund, it looks like the class was going to
put the drive over in almost unanimous
style. The most incomplete returns are
from the women of the class, there being
no complete reports from any of the
women's groups at present.
Those who have turned in reports are
as follows, the numbers in proportion to
the eligible members of the class being
given where possible:
Delta Chi, 1 senior, 1 subscription;
Alpha Delta Phi, 7 and 5; Kappa Sigma,
4 and 2. Phi Delta Theta, 4 and 3; Beta
Theta Pi, 6 and 6; Phi Gamma Delta, 4
and 3; Chi Psi, 3 and 2; Theta Chi, 6
and 6; Phi Kappa Psi, 3 and 1; Theta
Xi, 7 and 6; Delta Upsilon, 8 and 7;
Alpha Sigma Phi, 5 and 4; Encina, 35,
and Sequoia, 5. Incomplete returns are
in from several of the other groups but
members of the class remain to be seen
in them and final counts cannot be made.
It is expected by the early part of next
week that the committee will have a list
of the complete amount that is to be
taken out in policies.
