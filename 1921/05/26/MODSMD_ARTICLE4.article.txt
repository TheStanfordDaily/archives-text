# STANFORD NET MEN LOSE AT SEATTLE
## Davies and Neer Win One Set Out of Three Against University of Washington 
### 
Stanford's tennis team lost to the
University of Washington yesterday
afternoon by a score of two bouts to
one. All sets were very close and the
outcome of the tournament was ih
doubt until the final game. Two
singles matches were played, the two
teams breaking even. The doubles
match, deciding the contest, was taken
by Washington in three hard-fought
sets.
In tha first match of the day, Jimmy
Davies, Pacific Coast Conference
Champion, was a little off form and
was defeated by Marshall Allen of
the University of Washington. Davies
could not get his serve to working
while the Washington man played a
steady game throughout the contest.
In the Pacific Coast Conference tour
nament at Eugene last Friday, Davies
met Allen in the first round and had
but little trouble in disposing of him
in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, and Allen's
victory yesterday completely upset the
dope.
In the second singles match, Captain
Phil Neer won the only Stanford vic
tory of the tournament by defeating
Taylor of the Purple and Gold squad.
Although Taylor put up a stiff resist
ance, Neer had complete command of
the situation throughout, whining at
6-4, 5-7, and 6-3. In the doubles match,
Davies continued to have trouble with
his serve and the Washington combi
nation of Allen and Taylor took the
contest, 3-6, 11-9, 7-5. In several
games, the Stanford pair came within
an ace of taking the match and the
last two sets were forced to 32 games.
