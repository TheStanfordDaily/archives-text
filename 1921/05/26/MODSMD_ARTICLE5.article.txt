# STANFORD RECEIVES $20,000 GRANT FROM COMMONWEALTH FUND
## 
### 
Stanford University lias received from
the Commonwealth Fund of New York
a grant of $20,000 to be expended by
Professor Louis M. Terman, of the De
partment of Education, in furthering the
study of especially gifted children, on
which he has been engaged for a number
of years.
With this $20,000 Professor Terman
will send out five field agents to secure
definite facts about approximately 1000
children of superior intellectual ability.
This series of investigations is to be
completed by January, 1923, and plans
arc being formulated to follow the fu
ture careers of these children for a con
siderable period of years. Professor
Terman will have five selected field
workers for a month of intensive train
ing, and will send them out through the
state in September.
Professor Terman, during a period of
six years in which he has carried on* re
search work with gifted children, has
located nearly 200, each of whom ranges
in general mental ability well within the
top 1 per cent of the unselectcd school
population, and has gathered data on
more than 150 of these. The $20,000
from the Commonwealth Fund now en
ables him, through this intensive work,
to get data on a much larger number of
children than would otherwise be pos
sible in the limited time.
