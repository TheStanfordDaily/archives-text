# GOUNOD'S "FAUST' IS COMBINATION OF OPERA AND DRAMA
## 
### 
Daily rehearsals are going on, both at
Stanford and in San Francisco, in
preparation for the opera presentation
at the Assembly Hall, May 31. Gounod's
"Faust" is, for very good reasons, the
most popular opera ever written. It is
no accident that this opera has had more
representations than any other. A study
of the score soon reveals the reasons for
this. Based upon Goethe's dramatic
version of the Faust legend, and al
though primarily a tragedy, both the
drama and the opera run the whole
gamut of human emotion, and the opera
brings into special prominence the re
lieving elements of humor, dare
deviltry, pathos, ecstasy, malevolence,
and sublimity.
The music never fails in its descrip
tion of the emotion of the moment, and
as the rehearsals progress, it is evident
that the play will be just as gripping in
its intensity as when enacted upon the
stage.
There are two humorous scenes in the
opera. In the Kermesse scene, the sing
ers in the chorus represent the excited
populace of Nuremberg on the occasion
of the soldiers' departure for war. The
students are having a drink-fest, and
extolling wine, women, and song. The
soldiers are singing of the glory of war,
and the young women are flirting with
them most brazenly. The older women
scold the girls for their audacity, and a
vocal battle is the result, with the men
singing four independent parts at once,
while the women wrangle with each
other. The result is a tremendous but
harmonious confusion. The Kermesse
chorus is regarded as a masterpiece of
its kind, and its lilting melodies and
rhythmic swing will make this numjter
alone worth the price of admission.
The other scene providing comic re
lief is in the garden scene in the second
act, where Mephisto flirts with Martha,
in order to give Faust the opportunity to
woo Marguerite. Both Mr. Hevani and
Miss Campbell are singing this part with
the utmost cleverness, in the San Fran
cisco rehearsals. The quartet, contrast
ing the two flirtations between the prin
cipals, is one of the gems of the opera.
The exquisite duets between Mar
guerite and Faust (Miss Maude Fay and
Mr. Robert Battison) again justify the
never-waning popularity of "Faust." No
more beautiful melodies have been writ
ten. The two great trios, with the
choruses following them, provide the
greatest emotional climaxes of the entire
oper#. The first is between Faust, Me
phisto, and Valentine, and the latter
(Mr. Marsden Argall) sings some of the
greatest music in the score before he
dies, cursing his unfortunate sister.
The final trio in the prison where Mar
guerite is confined reaches heights of
sublimity.
The redemption of Marguerite is
typified by successive modulations of the
principal theme to higher and higher
keys, supported by a surging hard ac
companiment, and a full orchestral
background.
The entrance of the organ and chorus
at the end complete perfectly the end
and aim of the author, namely, the
triumph of the forces of good over the
powers of evil.

stage.
There are two humorous scenes in the
opera. In the Kermesse scene, the sing
ers in the chorus represent the excited
populace of Nuremberg on the occasion
of the soldiers' departure for war. The
students are having a drink-fest, and
extolling wine, women, and song. The
soldiers are singing of the glory of war,
and the young women are flirting with
them most brazenly. The older women
scold the girls for their audacity, and a
vocal battle is the result, with the men
singing four independent parts at once,
while the women wrangle with each
other. The result is a tremendous but
harmonious confusion. The Kermesse
chorus is regarded as a masterpiece of
its kind, and its lilting melodies and
rhythmic swing will make this numjter
alone worth the price of admission.
The other scene providing comic re
lief is in the garden scene in the second
act, where Mephisto flirts with Martha,
in order to give Faust the opportunity to
woo Marguerite. Both Mr. Hevani and
Miss Campbell are singing this part with
the utmost cleverness, in the San Fran
cisco rehearsals. The quartet, contrast
ing the two flirtations between the prin
cipals, is one of the gems of the opera.
The exquisite duets between Mar
guerite and Faust (Miss Maude Fay and
Mr. Robert Battison) again justify the
never-waning popularity of "Faust." No
more beautiful melodies have been writ
ten. The two great trios, with the
choruses following them, provide the
greatest emotional climaxes of the entire
oper#. The first is between Faust, Me
phisto, and Valentine, and the latter
(Mr. Marsden Argall) sings some of the
greatest music in the score before he
dies, cursing his unfortunate sister.
The final trio in the prison where Mar
guerite is confined reaches heights of
sublimity.
The redemption of Marguerite is
typified by successive modulations of the
principal theme to higher and higher
keys, supported by a surging hard ac
companiment, and a full orchestral
background.
The entrance of the organ and chorus
at the end complete perfectly the end
and aim of the author, namely, the
triumph of the forces of good over the
powers of evil.
Daily rehearsals are going on, both at
Stanford and in San Francisco, in
preparation for the opera presentation
at the Assembly Hall, May 31. Gounod's
"Faust" is, for very good reasons, the
most popular opera ever written. It is
no accident that this opera has had more
representations than any other. A study
of the score soon reveals the reasons for
this. Based upon Goethe's dramatic
version of the Faust legend, and al
though primarily a tragedy, both the
drama and the opera run the whole
gamut of human emotion, and the opera
brings into special prominence the re
lieving elements of humor, dare
deviltry, pathos, ecstasy, malevolence,
and sublimity.
The music never fails in its descrip
tion of the emotion of the moment, and
as the rehearsals progress, it is evident
that the play will be just as gripping in
its intensity as when enacted upon the
stage.
