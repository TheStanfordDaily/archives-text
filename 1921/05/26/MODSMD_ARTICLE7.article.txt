# Freshmen Choose White Hat With Cardinal Band For Next Year's Headgear
## 
### 
A white felt hat with a narrow
cardinal band was selected by the class
of '24, as its ofliicial sophomore head
gear, in a meeting held yesterday.
The tweed cap, the other style up for
consideration, was defeatd by a vote
of 129 to 61. The official hat is of
thick white felt which is set off by the
red band, and has a slightly rolled
brim. The price is $4. All members
of the class are requested to leave
their names and hat sizes with one
of the following men: Burdick, or
Cross, Encina Hall, or Rorke, at the
Phi Gamma Delta house.
In appealing to oil members of the
class who have not paid their dues
to come through with the necessary
dollar, it was stated that unless the
$F>oo quota was raised by the end of
the quarter, the awarding of sweaters
to freshman athletes would have to be
dispensed with.
Every freshman was urged to at
tend the Memorial Day ceremonies,
Sunday morning, by President Cald
well.
In regard to the payments on the
damage done in the baseball fight, it
was decided that the three dollars
assessed each member of the class
should be paid to J. D. Campbell, E. F.
Lichtenberg, or C. D. Janren.
