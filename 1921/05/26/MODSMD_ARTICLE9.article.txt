# DISTRIBUTION OF 1922 QUADS WILL BEGIN NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The 1922 Quad will be out next Tues
day and will be distributed Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday of next week
in the carnival headquarters inside of
the Men's Union from 8:30 to 4 each
day. Those who have lost their receipts
should inform Manager William H. Vos
burgh to that effect at once in order that
books may not be issued on those re
ceipts. Quads will be issued to those
who have lost their receipts on Thurs
day, the last day of the distribution.
Only 67 of the 1300 Quads printed are
still unsold. These may be procured by
applying to "the business manager.
This year's Quad preserves the note of
the red tiled roofs and the buff sand
stone throughout the book in the art
decorations and coloring. One of its
features will be the first set of etchings
ever made of Stanford and done by
Pedro J. Lemos, curator of the Mu
seum. The binding, with the exception
of those which are bound in real leather,
is of durable imitation red leather.
