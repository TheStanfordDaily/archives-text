# SPEAKING GROUPS ARE APPOINTED TO BOOST CAMPAIGN FOR STADIUM
## First Speeches Will Be Tuesday; All Campus Organizations to Hear Plans Discussed 
### 
Six speaking squads have been ap pointed to talk before the various liv
ing groups in behalf of the local drive of the stadium campaign. These
speakers will talk during meal hour s and in the evenings in an effort to
present the stadium proposition to th e students in a straight-forward man
ner. The idea of the committee is to have every student get a shoulder
behind the wheel and to help put th e project over with a bang. Chairman
Parks urges all students to get in touch with Alumni, friends or home-folk,
who might be interested in contributing to the stadium. This is not a pro
position which extends itself into the future, but a case of actual construc
tions to be completed within a few months and the contractor must be
financed as the work proceeds.
