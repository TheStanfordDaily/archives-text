# PHI DELTA THETA IS LEADER OF LEAGUES
## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta took the lead, yester
day, in the championship series by win
ning from Alpha Chi Sigma in a fast
game. The final score was 5 to 3. It
looked as though the losers were going
to stage a victorious rally in the last
period when the first two batters con
nected for a single and a double, netting
one run. However, Clark steadied and
retired the opposition with a strike-out,
a walk, and two more strike-outs. Hit
ting throughout the game was light. Four
blows were credited to each team. Bases
on balls seemed to be one of the im
portant features of the contest, Aspin
wall and McDermott of the chemists al
lowing eight, and Clark four. Until the
last of the fifth frame, the score was
tied at 1 all. Then the Phi Delta Theta
fireworks started. Two hits, one of
which was a triple by Clark, were util
ized to account for three tallies. The
star hitters of the contest were the op
posing pitchers, Clark and Aspinwall.
Alpha Chi Sigma took away some of
their opponents' over-confidence in the
first period by hanging up a tally. As
pinwall clicked out a good single and
went down to second when Cundall
walked, and to third when Demotid was
hit by a pitched ball. Larson hit a fly
to the outfield, and Aspinwall beat the
throw to home. Phi Delta Theta scored
on an error in the same inning. Whitte
more reached first base on an error by
the shortstop and started to steal second.
The catcher rainbowed his peg into the
sky, overthrowing the bag. Whittemore
kept running until he had crossed the
home plate, evening the score. Both
contingents failed to ripple the waves
in the next period, and went out nearly
one, two. three. In the third inning the
Phi Delts made a pretty double play.
The batter knocked a fast ball at Clark,
who scooped it up and threw to second.
Piggott shot the sphere to first base.
Not to be outdone, the opposing infield
pulled the moss-covered hidden ball
trick, catching a runner off second.
Nothing eventful occurred in the fol
lowing fourth frame. The fifth inning
was the winning parade for Phi Delta
Theta. Edwards started off with a walk,
and Clark helped his own game consider
ably by finding Aspinwall for a center
field triple-bagger, scoring Edwards.
Captain Whittemore whacked out a
single which brought in Clark. Carter
lifted a long fly into the center garden
on which Whittemore went home. Alpha
Chi Sigma endeavored to retrieve their
fortunes by replacing Aspinwall with
McDermott, who halted the scoring.
Alpha Chi Sigma could not even up the
score, and the game ended, 5 to 3.

The batter knocked a fast ball at Clark,
who scooped it up and threw to second.
Piggott shot the sphere to first base.
Not to be outdone, the opposing infield
pulled the moss-covered hidden ball
trick, catching a runner off second.
Nothing eventful occurred in the fol
lowing fourth frame. The fifth inning
was the winning parade for Phi Delta
Theta. Edwards started off with a walk,
and Clark helped his own game consider
ably by finding Aspinwall for a center
field triple-bagger, scoring Edwards.
Captain Whittemore whacked out a
single which brought in Clark. Carter
lifted a long fly into the center garden
on which Whittemore went home. Alpha
Chi Sigma endeavored to retrieve their
fortunes by replacing Aspinwall with
McDermott, who halted the scoring.
Alpha Chi Sigma could not even up the
score, and the game ended, 5 to 3.
Phi Delta Theta took the lead, yester
day, in the championship series by win
ning from Alpha Chi Sigma in a fast
game. The final score was 5 to 3. It
looked as though the losers were going
to stage a victorious rally in the last
period when the first two batters con
nected for a single and a double, netting
one run. However, Clark steadied and
retired the opposition with a strike-out,
a walk, and two more strike-outs. Hit
ting throughout the game was light. Four
blows were credited to each team. Bases
on balls seemed to be one of the im
portant features of the contest, Aspin
wall and McDermott of the chemists al
lowing eight, and Clark four. Until the
last of the fifth frame, the score was
tied at 1 all. Then the Phi Delta Theta
fireworks started. Two hits, one of
which was a triple by Clark, were util
ized to account for three tallies. The
star hitters of the contest were the op
posing pitchers, Clark and Aspinwall.
Alpha Chi Sigma took away some of
their opponents' over-confidence in the
first period by hanging up a tally. As
pinwall clicked out a good single and
went down to second when Cundall
walked, and to third when Demotid was
hit by a pitched ball. Larson hit a fly
to the outfield, and Aspinwall beat the
throw to home. Phi Delta Theta scored
on an error in the same inning. Whitte
more reached first base on an error by
the shortstop and started to steal second.
The catcher rainbowed his peg into the
sky, overthrowing the bag. Whittemore
kept running until he had crossed the
home plate, evening the score. Both
contingents failed to ripple the waves
in the next period, and went out nearly
one, two. three. In the third inning the
Phi Delts made a pretty double play.
