# LAST REHEARSAL OF "FAUST" TO BE HELD TOMORROW
## Children to Be Admitted; Organist W. D. Allen Will Explain Steps of Opera 
### 
All school children of the campus and
Palo Alto will be given an opportunity
to hear the University production of
"I'aust" at the final rehearsal which will
be held tomorrow morning at 9: 15 in
the Assembly Hall. The entire cast,
chorus and orchestra will be present for
this rehearsal, and for the benefit of tin
children Warren D. Allen will give ex
planatory comment before each step of
the opera. The admission charge will
be 25 cents.
Miss Maude Fay, who is to sing Mar
guerite, is an artist of the first rank, a
dramatic soprano whose work as a mem
ber of the Royal Opera at Munich and
of the Metropolitan Opera Company in
New York has given her an international
reputation. Italy, France, Germany, and
England have all contributed enthusiastic
appreciation to Miss Fay's success.
Geraldine Farrar and Mary Garden are
the only American prima donnas whose
continental reputation is as widespread
as that of this California singer.
Alexander Bevani, who sings Mephis
topheles, possesses a magnificent bass
and a most striking personality. His
tall, dramatic figure and powerful falcon
head are excellent histrionic equipment
for the role he has made famous in Lon
don and Milan.
Robert Battison, the Western tenor,
who has the title role, is a genial artist
whose heartiness and vigor will recall
the stage presence of Pasquale Amato
to his Stanford audience.
The find of Stanford's musical year.
Marsden Argall, '24, is on the road to a
justification of the prophecy of his New
York teachers that he has ahead of him
a brilliant career in opera. The com
ment of Selby Oppenheimer, manager
for the successful opera season which
closed recently in San Francisco, Ihat
with a few more Argalls Stanford could
present her own operatic cast, shows the
caliber of Argall's voice. Argall is a
quiet and unassuming chap, well known
in musical and artistic groups on the
campus.
C. L. McCormick. '19, who sings Wag
ner, leader of the famous chorus scenes
and student songs, is widjely known
throughout University and peninsula
circles for his splendid solo work during
bis undergraduate years. McCormick is
now living in San Francisco, and was
married only a few weeks ago. He re
cently represented in Guatemala the
coffee importing firm with which he is
associated.
Kejatan Attl, harpist, Hother Wismer,
violinist, and Nathan Firestone, 'cellist,
are perhaps, among the San Francisco
Symphony men who will take part in
"Faust," the best known to Stanford au
diences. In connection with the Cham
ber Music Society of San Francisco,
Firestone delighted Palo Alto and
campus hearers at the Community House
in Palo Alto in April. The entire
twenty-five men from Hertz' famo* or
ganization will handle the magnificent
orchestral opportunities of "Faust" with
the finish and technique known in the
West only to the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra. They have expressed
their pleasure at the work done by the
Stanford Orchestra men who will col
laborate with them on Tuesday night.
Seats may be obtained at the Admin
istration Building, at Crandall's in Palo
Alto, or at the box office on Tuesday
night, at $1.50, $1, and 50 cents, plus 10

Kejatan Attl, harpist, Hother Wismer,
violinist, and Nathan Firestone, 'cellist,

diences. In connection with the Cham
ber Music Society of San Francisco,

ganization will handle the magnificent

Miss Maude Fay, who is to sing Mar
guerite, is an artist of the first rank, a
dramatic soprano whose work as a mem
ber of the Royal Opera at Munich and
of the Metropolitan Opera Company in
New York has given her an international
reputation. Italy, France, Germany, and
England have all contributed enthusiastic
appreciation to Miss Fay's success.
Geraldine Farrar and Mary Garden are
the only American prima donnas whose
continental reputation is as widespread
as that of this California singer.
Alexander Bevani, who sings Mephis
topheles, possesses a magnificent bass
and a most striking personality. His
tall, dramatic figure and powerful falcon
head are excellent histrionic equipment
for the role he has made famous in Lon
don and Milan.
Robert Battison, the Western tenor,
who has the title role, is a genial artist
whose heartiness and vigor will recall
the stage presence of Pasquale Amato
to his Stanford audience.
The find of Stanford's musical year.
Marsden Argall, '24, is on the road to a
justification of the prophecy of his New
York teachers that he has ahead of him
a brilliant career in opera. The com
ment of Selby Oppenheimer, manager
for the successful opera season which
closed recently in San Francisco, Ihat
with a few more Argalls Stanford could
present her own operatic cast, shows the
caliber of Argall's voice. Argall is a
quiet and unassuming chap, well known
in musical and artistic groups on the
campus.

ner, leader of the famous chorus scenes
and student songs, is widjely known
