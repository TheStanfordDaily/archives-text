# A 						HOME FOR STANFORD TEAMS
## 
### 
1 lie present year has been a banner one for campaigns. There have
been drives and drives, some more and some less worthy. We may say
of them, however, that they are coming more to touch real student inter
est as the year nears its end.
I he great and profuse manner in which the various campaigns have
been scattered over the college year, which has perhaps left a natural
prejudice in most students minds against any sort of quest for financial
aid, should not be allowed to influence in the wrong way the greatest
athletic project on which Stanford has ever embarked.
It was hoped by the Hoard of Control that no drive among students
>hould be conducted. A stadium for the 1922 game was then planned.
I»ut as the situation has developed, a stadium for 1921 is almost a neces
sity. Any student may readily see what difficulty we should have in
socuring enough money for our stadium after California has scoured
the state for her $(>OO,OOO. 1 here is only one way by which Stanford
can have a bowl in the near future, and that is to build it immediately,
rhis requires all the aid consequently students are in on the
general scheme as well as alumni and outsiders, though not nearly to as
great an extent.
Of course there will be students who cannot afford to contribute.
No one who is actually unable should be forced to take part in the plan.
l>ut by lar a majority of students really can afford it. When dances
are regularly given that cost promoters from ten to fifty dollars each,
we can hardly believe that these same persons would really be pinched
unmercifully it they contribute five or ten dollars toward a home for
future Stanford athletic teams.
Any Stanford man who grasps the meaning of a Stadium will be
ready to exert himself to the utmost to aid in its progress. The total
amount that ma) be produced by the Stanford student bodv is small
when compared to the total cost of construction, but is very large when
we consider that it will put immediately to actual use. Campaign Man
<lKer J- K- Hickey states that $10,000 will be a very material sum in the
plan of stadium finance.
Let us not consider this stadium project in the light of the custom
ary drive. Rather it is the part the student body is to play in a great
venture of its own. No one is to be coerced into contributing. No one
who wishes not to take part in providing this insurance of Stanford's
athletic future should be forced to do so. Only those men and women
who are willing to back the Stanford spirit to a degree that involves a
ical pelsonal sacrifice will be factors in the Stanford stadium for No
vember.

NOMINA ! lONS ARE NOW OPEN for candidates t<> fill the various
student body offices of next year. I hey are to be filed in the ballot boxes
<>n the Quad, and may be placed there at any time before 1 uesday noon.
Students who have candidates in mind should not, in the confusion and
activity of the week-end and Monday's holiday, forget to place the nomi
nations before 12:00 o'clock Tuesday.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH the constitution, The Daily Palo \lto will

Any Stanford man who grasps the meaning of a Stadium will be
ready to exert himself to the utmost to aid in its progress. The total
amount that ma) be produced by the Stanford student bodv is small
when compared to the total cost of construction, but is very large when
we consider that it will put immediately to actual use. Campaign Man
<lKer J- K- Hickey states that $10,000 will be a very material sum in the
plan of stadium finance.
Let us not consider this stadium project in the light of the custom
ary drive. Rather it is the part the student body is to play in a great
venture of its own. No one is to be coerced into contributing. No one
who wishes not to take part in providing this insurance of Stanford's
athletic future should be forced to do so. Only those men and women
who are willing to back the Stanford spirit to a degree that involves a
ical pelsonal sacrifice will be factors in the Stanford stadium for No
vember.

1 lie present year has been a banner one for campaigns. There have
been drives and drives, some more and some less worthy. We may say
of them, however, that they are coming more to touch real student inter
est as the year nears its end.
I he great and profuse manner in which the various campaigns have
been scattered over the college year, which has perhaps left a natural
prejudice in most students minds against any sort of quest for financial
aid, should not be allowed to influence in the wrong way the greatest
athletic project on which Stanford has ever embarked.
It was hoped by the Hoard of Control that no drive among students
>hould be conducted. A stadium for the 1922 game was then planned.
I»ut as the situation has developed, a stadium for 1921 is almost a neces
sity. Any student may readily see what difficulty we should have in
socuring enough money for our stadium after California has scoured
the state for her $(>OO,OOO. 1 here is only one way by which Stanford
can have a bowl in the near future, and that is to build it immediately,
rhis requires all the aid consequently students are in on the
general scheme as well as alumni and outsiders, though not nearly to as
great an extent.
Of course there will be students who cannot afford to contribute.
No one who is actually unable should be forced to take part in the plan.
l>ut by lar a majority of students really can afford it. When dances
are regularly given that cost promoters from ten to fifty dollars each,
we can hardly believe that these same persons would really be pinched
unmercifully it they contribute five or ten dollars toward a home for
future Stanford athletic teams.
