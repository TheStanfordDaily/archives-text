# INTRAMURAL RELAY GOES TO EL CAMPO ON BASIS OF TIME
## 
### 
As a culmination of the intramural track
season an inter-group 220 eight-man
team relay was staged on the oval yes
terday afternoon. El Campo was the
winner of the best heat, and since no
final was run, can claim the race, their
time being 3 2-5 seconds better than that
of the winner of the second heat, Tlieta
Xi.
The groups represented were as fol
lows :
The first heat—El Campo, winner,
time 3:18 2-5; El Capitan, Theta Chi,
Sequoia, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi
Kappa Sigma, and Sigma Chi.
The second heat—Theta Xi, winner,
time 3:214-5; Breakers, Kappa Sigma,
Zeta Psi, and Phi Gamma Delta.
The feasibility of determining the
winner on a basis of time, without a final
heat, was challenged by the winners of
the second round, and a return bout may
be staged in which those taking places
in both heats will participate.
