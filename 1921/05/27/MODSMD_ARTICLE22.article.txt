Very pleasant diversion is found
in "The House That Jazz Built" down
at Stanford. Stickey Wilson ought
to have this latest picture of Wanda
Haw ley's suppressed, for it depicts the
evil of eating too much candy and
becoming fat and lazy. The wife in
the picture falls into just that condi
tion and when the husband sets out
to reform and reduce her we get
some interesting sidelights on men,
women, and human nature.
Another detail worthy of note is
that the artist, Penrhyn Stanlaws, di
rected the production. Stanlaws is
the man who does of the covers
for Hearst's magazine and his artist
ic good taste is well displayed in his
motion picture work.
Barrie Scores Again
In "Sentimental Tommy" we have
a production that is really fine. Sir
James M. Barrie's story of Tommy
Sandys, the young author, whose mind
persisted in going off on amazing tan
gents, is one of the most delightful
things that author ever wrote and
none of its ( harm has been lost in the
transfer to th(> screen. The Varsity
did wisely to book this picture for
three days for Palo Alto.
The cast, without containing a
single name of great importance, is
a nearly perfect as any cast could
be. Careth Hughes as Tommy, and
Mary McAvoy as Grizel, his sweet
heart, give a performance that will
touch the heart of anyone.
