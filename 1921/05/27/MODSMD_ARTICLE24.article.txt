## 
### 
The Fifth Far Eastern Olympic
Games will be held in Shanghai, China,
from May 30 to June 4, under the
auspices of the Y. M. C. A. There
will be about three hundred athlets
entered fro&i China, Japan and the
Philippines and an almost equal num
ber of Europeans and Americans, who
are now over there with international
concerns of other sorts. Many of
these Caucasians have been prominent
in athletics during their day and the
Y. M. C. A. promoters expect some
close competition.
The first games were held in Manila
ten years ago and they have been so
arranged that the different countries
have them in alternate order. These
games have been the waking of the
athletic impulse in the East and the
records are growing better and better
from year to year. The Y. M. C. A.
has been pushing western sports as
well as western civilization in the East
and have developed a big interest
especially in basketball. The recent
Stanford-in-China drive was held for
the purpose of furthering this work,
by supporting one of the secretaries
of the Canton Association, Mr.' Lock
wood.
