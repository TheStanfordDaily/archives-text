# PRAISE IS GIVEN FOR FIELD ARTILLERY UNIT
## 
### 
"I can scarcely believe that you have
no enlisted men in the drill," was the
statement made by General Muir upon
seeing the performance of the R. O. T. C.
Field Artillery unit last Saturday. The
General said that he had not seen a
better unit anywhere he had been, and
congratulated Major Collins quite highly
on the success of his instruction.
Coach Walter Powell, who has
coached at many schools having R. ().
T. C. units, has said that the Stanford
battery is the snappiest working outfit
of any he has ever seen. The Palo Alto
merchants evidently share this idea,
judging from the way they contributed
to the success of the performance by
the donation of the prizes. A three
pound box of candy received from Polos,
and a silver vanity case donated by Niel
son were the prizes of the women's
equitation contest. A box of cigars, the
donation of Slade's Cigar store, was
awarded the winner of the tractor race,
and ten tickets to the Varsity and ten
to the Stanford theater .were donated
bv the theaters as the bucking horse
prizes. The silver cups given as trophies
in the jumping events were obtained at
a great reduction from Seaman's and
the second prize in the high jump was a
pipe contributed by the United Cigar
Stores.
