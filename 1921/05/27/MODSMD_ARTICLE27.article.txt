# ENCINA HOLDS LAST SMOKER OF QUARTER
## 
### 
Bill Burkhard and Johnny Lane
mixed it for three rounds to a draw
in the main event of Encina Hall's
last smoker of the quarter, given last
night. In footwork and punches reg
istered both contestants drew equal
honors, although Burkhard skidded
into a few in the final session.
Ten freshmen upheld the honor of
the class in the opening number by
singing prep-school songs. C. G.
Bussey, S. H. Mendenhall, and J. O.
Vaughn then gave a ditty popular at
the University of California, which
was cheered in spite of the tenor.
Dramatic elocution was displayed in
its highest form by P. F. Landis, in his
recital of several poems. T. G. Irwin
told a few jokes, and G. M. Papazian
gave tropic selections on the mando
lin.
With his well-known trained cue,
L. A. Jacoby defeated R. L. Hamilton
in a contest for the billiard supremacy
of the Hall. After the removal of the
towels and buckets from the squared
circle, an exhibition fencing match
was put on by W. W. Wegner and P.
J. B. Sandretto, members of the var
sity fencing team.
