# MEXICAN EXHIBIT ID CLOSE HERE SUNDAY
## Unusual Exhibit of Maya and Aztec Art Contains Many Interesting Sculpture pieces 
### 
The display of Maya-Aztec and Ap
plied Arts that has been on exhibition
at the Art Gallery since the first of
the month will close here on Sunday.
Clubs, teachers, art students, and his
torians have made special efforts to
view primitive man's art accomplish
ments, handed down from the pre-
Columbian culture once flourishing in
Central America and Mexico.
The exhibition includes a large col
lection of photographs of ancient
cities, replicas of famous monuments,
the original of which are in the Mexi
can Museum collection, drawings,
relics and facsimiles of ancient manu
scripts. These serve to illustrate the
wealth of decorative and graphic art
possessed by America's aborigines,
and have been carefully classified to
enable the visitor to comprehend the
subject more clearly.
Manuel Centurion, the Mexican
sculptor, who at the Aztec studios is
creating interior models of modern
Mexican houses, fountains, statuary,
and tiles, has a group on exhibit. The
artist especially shows his skill in in
terpreting Indian types, Mr. Cornejo
says, and strikes a new note in Amer
ican sculpturing. The model of the
fountain, entitled, "The Last Struggle,"
is a particularly good sample. An en
largement of it is nearing completion,
and has occasioned much favorable
comment.
Scenes have been painted by Mr.
Cornejo from the Denishawn sets
made by him for the Moltec dance
drama "Xochitl."
The credit for this exhibit, which
will be placed in the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco after it leaves
Stanford, is due Francisco Cornejo, the
Mexican artist and founder of the
Aztec Studios in San Francisco.
