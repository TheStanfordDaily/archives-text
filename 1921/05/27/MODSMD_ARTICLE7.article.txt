Assembling in different parts of the
Quad, the classes will join in the
Mervorial Couri anil march to the
Church. Dr. David Starr Jordan and

In order to assure a wide attendance
at this function, every living group on
the campus has pledged itself to have
as many of its members as possible on
hand when the classes form. The fol
lowing opinions have been expressed by
the presidents of the different classes:
"The class of '21 should make it a
point of honor to turn out in full force
on the occasion of the commemoration
of those Stanford men who gave their
lives in their country's service."
