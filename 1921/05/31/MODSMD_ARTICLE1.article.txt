# STANFORD'S TRACK TEAM MAKES SPLENDID SHOWING IN BIG EASTERN MEET
## Four-Man Team Takes Fifth Place, Scoring Fifteen Points; Places in 100, Hurdles and High Jump 
### 
The Cardinal four-man track team, consisting of Morris Kirksey, Jess
Wells, Bob Williams and Lane Falk, gave a wonderful account of itself in
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet, held at Cambridge, Massachusetts, last Saturday,
by winning fifteen points and fifth place for Stanford, defeating Cornell
and Princeton, who tied for sixth with thirteen points each. The Blue and
Gold fourteen-man team won the classic with 27 1-2 points, nosing out the
Harvard team by half a point.
Kirksey took first in the hundred, Williams fourth in the 120-yard high
hurdles and tied for fourth in the high jump; Falk, second in the 220-yard
low hurdles, and Wells third in the low hurdles. Nothing definite has been

received as to why Kirksey did not
enter the 220-yard dash. This was the
last event tof the meet and when it
was started Harvard led California by
27 to 24 1-2. It has been rumored that
Kirksey stayed out of the event to
enable Hutchinson to take third place
and thereby win the meet for the
Bruins.
The Cardinal skipper had a bad
muscle when he left for the east and
there is good reason to believe that
this kept him out of the 220-yard race
rather than any feeling of layalty to
the Bruins.
Saturday's meet was the forty-fifth
annual classic of the I. C, A. A. A. A.
and California's victory marks the
first success of western athletes to
wrest the title from eastern teams.
Cornell and Pennsylvania have divided
the honors since 1909, when Harvard
won the meet. The showing of Stan
ford's four-man team was a complete
surprise to the eastern colleges and
even to local fans, for it was known
that they would compete against
twenty-nine universities representing
the best athletic material in America.

The work of Williams in the high
jump is typical of the way Cardinal
men come through for points in events
which they have not been working
in. Coach Templeton exhibited some
of the same ability when he placed in
the broad jump at the Olympic Games,
beating Merchant of California, who
was conceded to be a better man in
that event.
The Cardinal team will come home
by different routes and will arrive here
Thursday or Friday.

The Cardinal four-man track team, consisting of Morris Kirksey, Jess
Wells, Bob Williams and Lane Falk, gave a wonderful account of itself in
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet, held at Cambridge, Massachusetts, last Saturday,
by winning fifteen points and fifth place for Stanford, defeating Cornell
and Princeton, who tied for sixth with thirteen points each. The Blue and
Gold fourteen-man team won the classic with 27 1-2 points, nosing out the
Harvard team by half a point.
Kirksey took first in the hundred, Williams fourth in the 120-yard high
hurdles and tied for fourth in the high jump; Falk, second in the 220-yard
low hurdles, and Wells third in the low hurdles. Nothing definite has been

received as to why Kirksey did not
enter the 220-yard dash. This was the
last event tof the meet and when it
was started Harvard led California by
27 to 24 1-2. It has been rumored that
Kirksey stayed out of the event to
enable Hutchinson to take third place
and thereby win the meet for the
Bruins.
The Cardinal skipper had a bad
muscle when he left for the east and
there is good reason to believe that
this kept him out of the 220-yard race
rather than any feeling of layalty to
the Bruins.
Saturday's meet was the forty-fifth
annual classic of the I. C, A. A. A. A.
and California's victory marks the
first success of western athletes to
wrest the title from eastern teams.
Cornell and Pennsylvania have divided
the honors since 1909, when Harvard
won the meet. The showing of Stan
ford's four-man team was a complete
surprise to the eastern colleges and
even to local fans, for it was known
that they would compete against
twenty-nine universities representing
the best athletic material in America.

The work of Williams in the high
jump is typical of the way Cardinal
men come through for points in events
which they have not been working
in. Coach Templeton exhibited some
of the same ability when he placed in
the broad jump at the Olympic Games,
beating Merchant of California, who
was conceded to be a better man in
that event.
The Cardinal team will come home
by different routes and will arrive here
Thursday or Friday.

The Cardinal four-man track team, consisting of Morris Kirksey, Jess
Wells, Bob Williams and Lane Falk, gave a wonderful account of itself in
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet, held at Cambridge, Massachusetts, last Saturday,
by winning fifteen points and fifth place for Stanford, defeating Cornell
and Princeton, who tied for sixth with thirteen points each. The Blue and
Gold fourteen-man team won the classic with 27 1-2 points, nosing out the
Harvard team by half a point.
Kirksey took first in the hundred, Williams fourth in the 120-yard high
hurdles and tied for fourth in the high jump; Falk, second in the 220-yard
low hurdles, and Wells third in the low hurdles. Nothing definite has been

received as to why Kirksey did not
enter the 220-yard dash. This was the
last event tof the meet and when it
was started Harvard led California by
27 to 24 1-2. It has been rumored that
Kirksey stayed out of the event to
enable Hutchinson to take third place
and thereby win the meet for the
Bruins.
The Cardinal skipper had a bad
muscle when he left for the east and
there is good reason to believe that
this kept him out of the 220-yard race
rather than any feeling of layalty to
the Bruins.
Saturday's meet was the forty-fifth
annual classic of the I. C, A. A. A. A.
and California's victory marks the
first success of western athletes to
wrest the title from eastern teams.
Cornell and Pennsylvania have divided
the honors since 1909, when Harvard
won the meet. The showing of Stan
ford's four-man team was a complete
surprise to the eastern colleges and
even to local fans, for it was known
that they would compete against
twenty-nine universities representing
the best athletic material in America.

The work of Williams in the high
jump is typical of the way Cardinal
men come through for points in events
which they have not been working
in. Coach Templeton exhibited some
of the same ability when he placed in
the broad jump at the Olympic Games,
beating Merchant of California, who
was conceded to be a better man in
that event.
The Cardinal team will come home
by different routes and will arrive here
Thursday or Friday.
