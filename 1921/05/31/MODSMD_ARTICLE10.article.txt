# STADIUM CAMPAIGN TALKS OPEN TODAY
## 
### 
The first guns of the Stadium fund
campaign were fired this noon when the
five speaking parties got into action
among the living groups of the campus
on starting the collection of the pledges
for the financing of the students' part of
the Stadium. Phenomenal success was
met with by the speaking groups and all
things point to an early subscription of
the amount desired as the student quota.
Yesterday the committee on the rais
ing of the Stadium fund met in the
Women's Clubhouse for final instruc
tions and a chancc was given them there
to make the first subscriptions to the
campaign. The response was unanimous
and $360* was subscribed by the 36 mem
bers of the committee present.
Advance pledges have been coming in
for the last two days to the Headquar
ters of the Stadium Committee in the
Union, and more than $2000 has been
given in this manner.
The members of the speaking groups
will make two talks each day at living
groups and will cover the whole of the
campus by next Monday night.The noon
and evening meals will be utilized each
day for the giving of the information
speeches about the Stadium and the col
lection of the pledges. The need for
cash payments is made especially strong
by those in charge of financing the fund
because it is out of the money collected
that the first payments will have to be
met before the raising of the balance of
the funds on the outside can be com
pleted.
