# WHERE IS THE CENTER OF INTEREST

### 
Events in the past few weeks have been following one another in
such rapid succession that not a great many of us have grasped their
complete significance. The Stanford student body has never faced cir
cumstances at all similar to those of the present outlook. We have never
been confronted with problems quite as tough on one hand, and oppor
tunities as favorable on the other, as are found in the present situation.
The assembly tomorrow should straighten out the several important
phases of this situation, so that each student will know at just what level
affairs of his University now stand. Dr. Wilbur will speak briefly, and
it is characteristic of the President that he "talks plainly" when he comes
before us. Student speakers will present considerations bearing on our
success for next year. The simple steps in the installation of the honor
system will be outlined.
Unique stadium ground-breaking exercises are planned to take up
the prominent place on the program. A new Stanford emblem and
trophy is to be produced, one that with careful guarding should take the
place of our well-known "axe."
The Stanford l'and, the yell leaders, the student body officials, and
the Stadium Committee have together planned the greatest student body
assembly of many months. The only question yet to be asked is, where
will the student body be at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. President Wilbur
and the faculty have made an unprecedented decision in granting two
class hours for the exercises. Yet we can't help but wonder if |. I ligh
class Deadhead, driving about in his cut-down Stutz at 10:30 tomorrow
morning, will notice the men "(Ileefully knocking golf balls about," and
women leisurely taking themselves to their homes on the row. as on
former occasions. Will the pool tables and reading rooms of Encina
and Sequoia be thriving with the presence of men relieved from lecture
or recitation periods? Will the women of Roble be walking around the
Lake or studying in the Library?
Or, will the halls and the row be deserted?
