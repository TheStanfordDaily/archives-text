# A 						STANDARD IN MUSIC
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, organist, (ilee Club and musical director, has for
two years been developing' musical standards at the University with tin
view of eventually making Stanford first in this field. The production
of "Faust" this evening embodies the climax of two years' endeavor, and
the height of musical achievement in this community.
Stanford should stand for the best in everything. We may set an
exceptional standard in the college world of music by allowing Mr. Allen
to continue with the kind of work beginning with the presentation of
"Faust." Unfortunately Mr. Allen and the talented people who have
been working with him cannot "continue the work alone. This, like even
other worthy activity, must receive student support. Those among the
student body who love and appreciate real music may see that the pro
moters of tonight's program are in no way disappointed.
