# Student Organizations Appeal For Loyal Support of Stadium
## 
### 
The following student organizations
have expressed support of the Stadium
and urge all students to get behind the
local drive in order to put it over with
a bang:
"It is little enough to ask that one
twentieth of the amount needed for the
Stadium be contributed from the
campus." Guy Draper,
President of Encina Club.
"Roble Club urges every Stanford man
and woman to support the present
Stadium fund campaign to the utmost to
make possible -for Stanford the Stadium
by next November."
Frederika McGee,
President of Roble Club.
"In the present Stadium drive the tra
ditional Stanford spirit is put to the test
and it will not fail. Quadrangle Club
indorses the drive most heartily."
Quadrangle Club.
"Now that it he campaign is being
waged for money for a Stadium, Chap
pie will swing his old mallet along with
the others in building it, and the old
boy knows that the mere matter of a
few dollars will not keep Stanford from
erecting the best structure of its kind on
the Pacific Coast."
Hammer and Coffin Society,
By Arthur Harzfeld, Editor of
Chaparral. I
! "The Stadium drive presents to every
I one a chance to make a greater Stan
ford. We should not stop until the
quota has been reached twice over."
Bernice Erankenheimen.
President of Cap and Gown.
"We have given to every other cause
; whether here or in distant lands. Now
I we must give to build a Stadium on our
I own campus and should do it gladly."
E. A. Weli.s,
President of Phi Delta Phi.
"Ram's Mead endorses heartily the
Stadium campaign."
Bob Armstrong, President.
"If other universities can build

"Every one at Stanford should be will
ing to contribute at least $10 to make
possible a Stadium, and every one
should be willing to give at least that
much to the University. By contributing
to the present Stadium fund both of
these things are done. Skull and Snakes
urges every student to give the utmost
in time and money for the Stadium and
for Stanford." Fred Adams,
President of Skull and Snakes.
"Holmes Chapter of Phi Alpha Delta
is solidly behind the Stadium drive, for
to be behind this drive is to be behind
Stanford, and that is the only reason
why any organization should exist at
Stanford." G. H. Jertberg,
President of Holmes Chapter, Phi Al
pha Delta.
"Every student on the campus is de
sirous of having a Stadium and inas
much as our alumni are giving their
services and money to make the Stadium
a reality, the students should willingly
raise $10,000 as a mark of approval of
the alumni endeavors. Assuming the
average student's monthly income is as
low as $50, and they are asked to sub
scribe $10, the average alumnus is asked
to give $100, or ten times a<- much. Pro
portionately the average alumnus would
be expected to have an income of $500
per month. We all know this is not
true, and with a realization of the sacri
fice being made by our alumni members,
we students should not hesitate a mo
ment to grant our share." *
Joe T. Murphy,
President of "Circle-S" Society.
"The Stadium project is of great im
portance to the future of Stanford ath
letics 'and will be one of the largest
achievements in the history of the Uni
versity. It is worthy of the utmost sup
port from every man and woman on the
campus, and should be put over with the
proper spirit." Bernard F. Haley,
President of Sequoia Club.
