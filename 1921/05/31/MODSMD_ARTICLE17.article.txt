THE STADIUM AND "FAUST"
Tomorrow's Assembly will bring be
fore the campus the Stadium project, de
signed to put Stanford in the top rank
of American universities from the ath
letic standpoint. Tonight the campus
has before it a decision of equal im
portance. If "Faust." Stanford's most
ambitious musical undertaking, goes l over
the top from the box office standpoint at
<S o'clock tonight, Stanford as a musical
and artistic center is definitely on the
map, on a scale that brings her into
worthy comparison with the annual musi
cal' achievements that are a fundamental
part of the name and fame of the four
great eastern universities. If the stu
dent body does not support Stanford's
effort to rank as a big university in this
aspect, the most ambitious stadium ever
designed, and the best athletic team ever
turned out, will not rank Stanford
where she belongs. "Man does not live
by bread alone," —and a university can
be very noisy without being great, if
she lavishes money and enthusiasm only
on impressive externals.
Organist Warren I). Allen has for two
years built up Stanford's musical re
sources giving without stint of his
knowledge, his ability, anrl his energy
and enthusiasm, to make Stanford
music a vital feature of Stanford life.
Saturday morning's rehearsal left 110
one in doubt that "Faust," his greatest
undertaking, i- an overwhelming success
from the standpoint of art and enjoy
ment. Tonight it is up to the student
body: shall we get behind an achieve
ment like this, that matches the Stadium
project in its bearing on Stanford's fu
ture—or do we want to go on record,
via the Assembly Ilall box office to
: night, as preferring the movies? 1
