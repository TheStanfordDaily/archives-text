# SAILORS WIN FROM CARDINAL MRS
## 
### 
Coacli Stay's diamond artists lost the
/mirth game of the spring practice scries
when the Goat Island Naval Training
Station nine took home the large end of
a 5-3 score from the local field Saturday
afternoon. The contest was hard fought
throughout, with the honors in the bal
ance until the last man took the count,
but the Cards could not connect with
the apple, annexing only live hits to the
visitors' ten.
Nef did the chucking for the Seayites,
with Bundy taking the throws. With the
exception of two slugging attacks which
netted runs for the sailors, he held them
down in good shape, and with the right
brand of stick work from the home nine
would have easily won his game. Mort
Kline was the star of the game, making
seven putouts and garnering three blows,
one of them a homer. In the first frame
the gobs took the count in one-two-three
order, with two Hies to Kline's territory
and a third to Peavy in right. Peavy
and Kallam failed to connect with
Moudy's offerings, and Green flew out to
left field.
In the second spasm Tice drove a long
one to left and completed the journey
but was caught off home plate with his
spectacular attack wasted. Mort Kline
took the cue from Tice and drove one
down the third base line which was good
for a round trip ticket, scoring the first
tally of the game. The third frame was
quiet, and tlie fourth failed to bring re
sults for either side, although Tice and
Kline annexed another blow each. The
fifth proved ill-fated for Nef. as the
sudgy-pushers drove out three hits and
crossed the rubber for two tallies, giv
ing them the lead. The Cards failed to
start anything in their period.
The gobs cnme back in the sixth for
another hit and a tally to match it. But
Moudy struck a snag about this time,
too. Pcavy drew a pass to the paths on
the first baseman's error, and Kallam,
Green, and Kline followed him with
three blows which scored Peavy and
Kallam and tied the score. The seventh
was calm, but the tars managed to get
two blows in both the eighth and ninth
frames which netted them a tally for
each period and gave them the scalp.
Gillus took the mound in the ninth for
the Card and, with the exception of a
passed ball which let in a run, lie suc
ceeded in holding the gobs down. In
the Card period of the ninth Patterson
got on by the third baseman's fumble
and Heckendorf followed him with a
blow which sent the apple on a long
journey to the territory between left and
center, but the left fielder had the right
hunch on Lefty's possibilities, was play
ing deep enough for a fence-ball, and
managed to pull down what should have
been a home run.

Coacli Stay's diamond artists lost the
/mirth game of the spring practice scries
when the Goat Island Naval Training
Station nine took home the large end of
a 5-3 score from the local field Saturday
afternoon. The contest was hard fought
throughout, with the honors in the bal
ance until the last man took the count,
but the Cards could not connect with
the apple, annexing only live hits to the
visitors' ten.
Nef did the chucking for the Seayites,
with Bundy taking the throws. With the
exception of two slugging attacks which
netted runs for the sailors, he held them
down in good shape, and with the right
brand of stick work from the home nine
would have easily won his game. Mort
Kline was the star of the game, making
seven putouts and garnering three blows,
one of them a homer. In the first frame
the gobs took the count in one-two-three
order, with two Hies to Kline's territory
and a third to Peavy in right. Peavy
and Kallam failed to connect with
Moudy's offerings, and Green flew out to
left field.
In the second spasm Tice drove a long
one to left and completed the journey
but was caught off home plate with his
spectacular attack wasted. Mort Kline
took the cue from Tice and drove one
down the third base line which was good
for a round trip ticket, scoring the first
tally of the game. The third frame was
quiet, and tlie fourth failed to bring re
sults for either side, although Tice and
Kline annexed another blow each. The
fifth proved ill-fated for Nef. as the
sudgy-pushers drove out three hits and
crossed the rubber for two tallies, giv
ing them the lead. The Cards failed to
start anything in their period.
The gobs cnme back in the sixth for
another hit and a tally to match it. But
Moudy struck a snag about this time,
too. Pcavy drew a pass to the paths on
the first baseman's error, and Kallam,
Green, and Kline followed him with
three blows which scored Peavy and
Kallam and tied the score. The seventh
was calm, but the tars managed to get
two blows in both the eighth and ninth
frames which netted them a tally for
each period and gave them the scalp.
Gillus took the mound in the ninth for
the Card and, with the exception of a
passed ball which let in a run, lie suc
ceeded in holding the gobs down. In
the Card period of the ninth Patterson
got on by the third baseman's fumble
and Heckendorf followed him with a
blow which sent the apple on a long
journey to the territory between left and
center, but the left fielder had the right
hunch on Lefty's possibilities, was play
ing deep enough for a fence-ball, and
managed to pull down what should have
been a home run.
