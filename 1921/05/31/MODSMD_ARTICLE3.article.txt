Announcing immediate tryouts for the
position of stage manager as the first
step in its plan for reorganizing the
method of choosing campus stage crews,
Sword and Sandals society requests that
all men who wish to apply for the po
sition communicate immediately with the
present stage manager, C. E. Stewart,
'21, room 44, Encina. Stewart is grad
uating this quarter, but before he goes?
he will have a chance to test the appli
cants on the Senior Earce, "Clarence,"
the scenery for which is now being built.
The position calls for some ability at
carpenter work as well as a knowledge
of stage equipment and its handling.
However, great technical skill in these
things is not required and all those who
feel that they have any qualifications for
the work arc urged to give it a trial.
Heretofore positions on the stage crew
have been reserved largely for members
or prospective members of Sword and
Sandals. Under the new system the so
ciety will hold open tryouts to select the
election, property man, scenic artist, and
stage manager. The present crew is emi
nently satisfactory, say the members of
the organization, and no further tryouts
will be held except as these men, for
one reason or another, give up their po
sitions.
When a man is chosen for one of the
above four places he will, beginning next
year, be placed on a straight salary basis
of so much per show. This eliminates
the troublesome time card system and
a man will be retained so long as he con
tinues to make good.
