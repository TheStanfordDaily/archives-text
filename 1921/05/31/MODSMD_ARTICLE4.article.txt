# "FAUST" com 10 BE GIVEN IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Opera Will Be Presented This Evening; Professional and Local Talent To Take Part 
### 
Stanford's biggest musical project will
he presented at 8 o'clock this evening
in the Assembly Hall, when a brilliant
cast, an orchestra composed of San
Francisco Symphony players and Uni
versity orchestra men, and a chorus corn-

posed of the best crmpu" and local
voices, appears in the most popular of
the operas, Gounod's "Faust."
The. sensation created by Saturday
morning's dress rehearsal among the
fortunate adults who accompanied chil
dren to the performance indicates that
tonight the Stanford student body has
before it the opportunity to hear great
music greatly rendered. Among these
was Professor W. L. Cooper, who has
commented as follows:
"After hearing the final rehearsal of
Gounod's 'Faust' given as an oratorio in
the Assembly Hall last Saturday morn
ing, I want to say that there is a musical
treat in store for us tonight that no

Marguerite in "Faust" at the Assem
bly Hall.
lover of lyric opera can afford to miss.
The advance press notices were justified.
Maude Fay's singing of the Marguerite,
and Bevani's rendering of the Mephisto,
i recalled vividly the perfect performance
(if the opera which I last heard in the
Paris Opera. I never saw a singer get
more fun out of a part than Bevani out
of Mephistoâ€”you need to watch him
when he sings, especially when he lets
out his diabolical laugh. When lie shows
his teeth you will understand why the
devil was reported to accompany Faust
at times in the guise of a dog! Ihe
other soloists sang in true concert form.
The excellent work of the chorus drew
from Maude Kay such words of com
mendation that they would better he
withheld from the ears of the chorus
lest they turn their heads. We all know
what to expect of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra."
Asked if he missed the acting and
scenery of a regular opera production.
Professor Cooper said: "1 was glad to
have a chance to hear an oratorio ren
dering of the opera, which after all,
makes its appeal to the sense of hearing,
i found that the lack of distracting
scenery and costumes heightened the ef
fect of the music."
The students who compose the great
chorus have a large share of the re
sponsibility for the brilliant perform
ance given on Saturday morning. "They
Have worked with tremendous enthusi
asm." said Director Warren I>. Allen
today, "and will do justice tonight to
the great Kermesse scene for which
'Faust' is famous." Soldiers, students,
village girls, are all vividly presented in
the great chorus.
The smooth co-operation of the
twenty-two pieces from the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, with the
regular Stanford Orchestra, will be an
interesting feature of the orchestral
work that is so large a part of the un
dying appeal of "Faust." Kajetan Attl,
harpist, and Nathan Firestone, first vio
lin. are among the men from Hertz' or
ganization who are eagerly anticipated
by thr campus and Palo Alto musical
public. Among the students in the or
chestra is Miss Frances Fish, second
violin. Professor A. C. Whitaker and
his son are horn players, and Charles
Midgley, whose work as a composer i
familiar on the campus, is responsible
for the bass drum and cymbals.
The work of the cast gives Stanford
rare opportunity to hear both profes
sional voice's that have "arrived," and
amateur voices of brilliant promise, in
the same performance. Miss Maude hav,
of Munich, London, and San Francisco,
sings a Marguerite of compelling dra
matic power and exquisite finish. Alex
ander Bevani, as Mephistopeles. com
bines a magnificent bass and a magnetic
personality. Robert M. Battison, in the
title role, has a tenor of beauty and
| power. The interest of the campus is
focused, however, on the performance of
two Stanford men, Marsden Argall, '24,
whose baritone is the lind of the Uni
versity musical year, and C. L. McCor
tnick, '19, who is remembered as a soloist
of great ability.
