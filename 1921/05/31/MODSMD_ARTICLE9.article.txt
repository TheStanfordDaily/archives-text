## 
### 
"It is in the moments when we think
of these men that we are strong in the
faith of democracy and" peace," said
Reverend Willard L. Sperry, in address
ing the congregation gathered for the
memorial services to Stanford's war
dead. "The bitter dregs of moral re
action arc now being tasted. It is the
life work of every man, the plain vo
cation of all, to rebuild the society of
hope and faith. Tiic deeper meaning of
Memorial Day is to discover those
springs of undying moral power."
Homage to the departed heroes was
paid in its fullest sense in the services
held in the Memorial Church Sunday
morning. In spite of adverse weather
conditions, fully five hundred students
marched through the portals of the
church when the classes had gathered.
In opening the services, Dr. Gardner
stated that the ceremony was especially
fitting in view of the sixty-nine gold
stars in the service flag above. F. L.
McElroy, representing the student body,
then laid upon the altar the memorial
wreath dedicated to the Stanford men
who have lost their lives in the great
war. The memorial hymn, "The Su
preme Sacrifice," completed the cere
mony.
Dr. Gardner rcaul as the scripture les
son the fourth chapter of the Wisdom
of Solomon. "To Thee, O Lord, I \ ield
My Spirit," sung by the choir, and the
hymn, "Love That Wilt Not Let Me
Go," followed.
The text chosen by Reverend Mr.
Sperry for his sermon was from the
eleventh chapter of Hebrews, verses 39-
40, "These having died in faith received
not the promise, God having provided
some better thing for us, that they with
out us should not be made perfect." He
asserted that the task of the men who
died in France would remain unfinished,
without the work of us, the living. At
the conclusion, a prayer was offered.
A choral, "Sanctus" (Gounod), and the
hymn, "Crossing the Bar," followed.
The benediction then closed the service.
