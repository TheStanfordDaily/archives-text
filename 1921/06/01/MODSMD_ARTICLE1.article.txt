# 'FAUST' CONCERT IS SUCCESSFUL AS UNDERTAKING
## Opera Presentation Complete In Details of Orchestral Work; Leads are Pleasing 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
"Faust," Gounod's immortal master
piece, as given in the Assembly Hall,
last evening, has placed Stanford mu
sical undertakings in a sphere never
before reached and has opened the
way to new and greater possibilities.
The concert marks the pinnacle of a
year of brilliant musical events and
insures the institution of a new tradi
tion, an annual music festival which
will be primarily a student interest.
The opera last night was an im
pressive success in every way. En
thusiasm in the presentation was evi
dent not only in those who took part
but also in those who witnessed it and
a large audience gave responsive sup
port to the unusual and exceedingly
satisfying interpretation of the opera.
Organist Warren D. Allen is direct
ly responsible for the achievement.
Mr. Allen has worked ardently and
enthusiastically in the interests of
University music during the past two
years, and through his efforts as
director, last night's performance was
one complete as to details of choral
work, finished in orhestration, and
ideal as to the choice of solo artists.
To him is due much of the success
of "Faust" from the broad and artistic
treatment of the ensemble to all the
minor details of presentation.
The fact that the opera was given
in concert form did not lessen the
dramatic effect, but rather heightened
the beauty and power of the music,
which expressed every element of
emotion, joy. pathos, rage, repentance.
The work of the soloists maintained
interest in the action. Alexander Be
vani, in particular, as Mephistoplieles,
was entirely in the role he sang. He
won instant appeal through his facial
expression, his mannerisms and a
fiendish laugh which made him a vivid
ly diabolic and intriguing Mepihsto,
and his singing was marked by rich
ness and quality of timbre.
Maude Fay was a charming Mar
guerite. Combined with a naturalness
and charm of manner, she possesses a
voice of beauty and power, remarkable
in clarity and range. Robert Battison
as "Faust" sang the title role with a
clear tenor which left nothing to be de
sired in perfection of technique, and
Nona Campbell interpreted the mezzo
soprano role of Sicbel with artistic skill
and an appreciation of the score. Mars
den Argall, '24, and C. L. McCormick,
as Valentine and Wagner, sang with
marked'professional finish.
The work of the chorus, which was
composed mostly of members" of the
University choir, the Schubert and Glee
clubs and residents of Palo Alto, dis
played voices of genuine quality, and
the choral numbers, particularly the
"Kermesse Scene," and the familiar
"Soldiers' Chorus," and the finales
which represented much work and
endeavor, placed their work far above
the amateur.
The beautiful music of Gounod's opera
was in the hands of an orchestra made
up of the best known of Alfred Hertz'
Symphony Orchestra, augmented by
musicians of the Stanford and Palo Alto
community, and their playing was a
careful and perfectly balanced accrVn
paniment throughout the opera to the
last sustained note which marks the
triumph of "good over evil."

years, and through his efforts as
director, last night's performance was
one complete as to details of choral
work, finished in orhestration, and
ideal as to the choice of solo artists.
To him is due much of the success
of "Faust" from the broad and artistic
treatment of the ensemble to all the
minor details of presentation.
The fact that the opera was given
in concert form did not lessen the
dramatic effect, but rather heightened
the beauty and power of the music,
which expressed every element of
emotion, joy. pathos, rage, repentance.
The work of the soloists maintained
interest in the action. Alexander Be
vani, in particular, as Mephistoplieles,
was entirely in the role he sang. He
won instant appeal through his facial
expression, his mannerisms and a
fiendish laugh which made him a vivid
ly diabolic and intriguing Mepihsto,
and his singing was marked by rich
ness and quality of timbre.
Maude Fay was a charming Mar
guerite. Combined with a naturalness
and charm of manner, she possesses a
voice of beauty and power, remarkable
in clarity and range. Robert Battison
as "Faust" sang the title role with a
clear tenor which left nothing to be de
sired in perfection of technique, and
Nona Campbell interpreted the mezzo
soprano role of Sicbel with artistic skill
and an appreciation of the score. Mars
den Argall, '24, and C. L. McCormick,
as Valentine and Wagner, sang with
marked'professional finish.
The work of the chorus, which was
composed mostly of members" of the
University choir, the Schubert and Glee
clubs and residents of Palo Alto, dis
played voices of genuine quality, and
the choral numbers, particularly the
"Kermesse Scene," and the familiar
"Soldiers' Chorus," and the finales
which represented much work and
endeavor, placed their work far above
the amateur.
The beautiful music of Gounod's opera
was in the hands of an orchestra made
up of the best known of Alfred Hertz'
Symphony Orchestra, augmented by
musicians of the Stanford and Palo Alto
community, and their playing was a
careful and perfectly balanced accrVn
paniment throughout the opera to the
last sustained note which marks the
triumph of "good over evil."
"Faust," Gounod's immortal master
piece, as given in the Assembly Hall,
last evening, has placed Stanford mu
sical undertakings in a sphere never
before reached and has opened the
way to new and greater possibilities.
The concert marks the pinnacle of a
year of brilliant musical events and
insures the institution of a new tradi
tion, an annual music festival which
will be primarily a student interest.
The opera last night was an im
pressive success in every way. En
thusiasm in the presentation was evi
dent not only in those who took part
but also in those who witnessed it and
a large audience gave responsive sup
port to the unusual and exceedingly
satisfying interpretation of the opera.
Organist Warren D. Allen is direct
ly responsible for the achievement.
Mr. Allen has worked ardently and
enthusiastically in the interests of
University music during the past two
years, and through his efforts as
director, last night's performance was
