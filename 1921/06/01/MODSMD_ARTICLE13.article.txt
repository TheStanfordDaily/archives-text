# IS PROBATION SATISFACTORY?

What is the luisis of probation, and does it actually accomplish its
purpose? The system has been practiced so long at Stanford that it
has come to be an almost accepted part of the University. In theory it
is wonderful. Any student whose class work falls within a designated
zone is warned that he is dangerously low. Furthermore he is forbidden
to take part in any activity as dramatics, journalism, band, or any inter
collegiate competition. Thus he is kept away from the practices which
make him a poor student, and will therefore devote more time to study
and improve his standing. Probation has come to mean penalty—prohi
bition from activity.
There is but one reason for the existence of probation, the improve
ment of general scholarship. Is this actually accomplished? Of course,
many students work somewhat harder when on probation in order to get
off "pro." l>nt how much has the penalty element to do with this?
Probably not more than one man in five on probation is affected by
the disqualification for college activity, because four of them are not
interested in activity. It is, of course, impossible to determine accurately
how many students on probation would actually be engaged in some
•activity if not thus disqualified, but estimates of competent persons make
the ration of one to five very high. Less liberal estimates have it that
•one man in eight on probation is disqualified or ruled out of activity.
One of five men on "pro," then, is taken out of activity in order that he
may study more. The other four are not affected by the penalty provi
sion since their extra-academic time has been spent in dancing or at city
parties, which, after all, are responsible for more low standings than
activity. If four students are not affected, we believe the penalty ele
ment unwise and ineffectual, since it does not prevent the participation
in activities which are primarily responsible for low standing.
Now, does the penalty clement actually make the man whom it does
affect study more. A certain varsity second baseman went on probation
not long ago. Did he then turn his time to studies? Instead he spent
the afternoons pitching for an intramural ball team and took one or two
extra trips to the city. Here the penalty did not give the student more
time for study, but it transferred his activity from intercollegiate compe
tition to other fields.
Of course there are probably other men who do study more because
of having been taken out of activity. Hut on the whole the penalty pro
\ision of probation seems ineffectual in that it does not include four
out of five men on pro, and furthermore because the penalty does not
prevent participation in social functions or more important causes of
low grades. It really does not accomplish its purpose with many men
whom it does affect, since it merely transfers their interest instead of
making them study more. It directly handicaps activity to the further
ing of less worthy enterprises, since the men who go on "pro" because
they spend too much time dancing go on dancing after being placed on
"pro," while the men who were engaged in activity are ruled out of
activity but are then free to spend more time in social and other affairs.
It is really the dissatisfaction of being on probation that makes a
man work hard to get off the status, more than the fact that he is for
bidden to engage in certain activity. A probation scheme based on this
•premise, we believe, would work better results in bringing up the general
scholarship. Activity that is in itself quite worthy is now handicapped
with no appreciable benefit to scholarship. z
