# PICK THEM OUT
## 
### 
Tomorrow the student body will choose the men who will bear the
brunt of criticism for the handling of student affairs next year. Every
■office up for consideration is important, and there is no student who will
snot at some time next year be in some way dependent on the men selected.
Student body officers have a great deal to do with the reputation of
.'Stanford. When capable and aggressive men with ability to think in terms
•of the University are selected in which they make up one of the most im
portant factors in its progress. Next year is a crucial year. With the
new lease of life to come with the stadium most important problems are
bound to arise for decision of student officers. The honor system must
be put over. Student officials with intelligence and understanding of
University affairs are needed, officials who can secure an harmonious
campus support in worth-while enterprises.
The time will come when many who do not vote tomorrow will
wish different student officers had been selected. The time to exercise
judicious choice is tomorrow. Let every student take a part in placing
in office strong, intelligent, representative Stanford students.
