## 
### 
The New Book Shelf this week con
tains many books which will be of in
terest to the "nosey" reader with a
few minutes to spare. A symposium
on spiritualism, entitled "Spiritualism:
Its present-Day Meaning," edited ,by
Huntley Carter, gives a thorough and
unbiased investigation into the true
relationship of science and faith. The
book is the result of a series of ques
tions submitted to a large number of
distinguished persons and is repre
sentative of both sides of the question.
Among the questions asked are, "What
is the most powerful argument for
Spiritualism? and, What is the best
means of organizing the movement in
the highest interest of the nation,
especially as a factor of durable
peace?" Karkhushru J. Tarachanr,
Professor Henri Bergson, and Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle are some of the
contributors.
Carl Sandburg's new book of poems,
"Smoke and Steel," has just appeared
and is one the local shelves. Sand
burg is one of America's younger poets
and is the author of" Chicago Poems,"
"Cornhuskers" and others.
Of passing interest, is a large four
volume quarto written in Latin and
concerning Great Britain and Ireland.
