# CABBAGES AND THINGS
## 
### 
Having been deprived of our old
determination to make Monday a Cab
bage holiday, we found it necessary
to stretch it over Tuesday this week.
But the longer we put 'em off, the
shorter they get. Condoners, pray for
a seven-day stretch.
* » *
It is surely appropriate that the
column be devoted to the discussion
of the merits of nominees who are to
be voted on in the election tomorrow.
However, after taking one look at the
awful array of candidates, we've de
cided that there's nothing to discifss.

I. B. Dashed comes to the fore with
the declaration that telephones may
not always be where they belong, but
they're no ringers. Mr. U. B. Dished
chortles as he remarks that a tele
phone may not look like a mangle, but
it's a wringer, anyway.

STILL ASTRONOMY
Wein —See where fedral sleuths have
been shadowin' Pete's moonshine still.
Stein —Aha! A sort of a lunar
eclipse, eh?
* • •
Having been referred to as the
"I). P. A. Disaster," we ought to sub
side into moody silence, but in order
to justify our nick-name, we'll try to
become a second Johnstown flood.
V » •
Our razzer remarks that flood is
good. Says he knew is was a flow
of anything but wit.

Sunshine makes the world go 'round,
but moonshine makes it go 'round and
'round. It ought to make it still.

If your friend # won't touch your
home-brew, you may rest assured that
he's got a case of sour grapes.
