Mellow Drama and Melodrama
A slow moving sort of picture with
! some incidental points of interest —
j such is "Sheltered Daughters" down
at the Stanford. These points of in
j terest include the star. Justice John
' stone, who is exceedingly fair to look
! upon but who won't make Nazimova
| nervous by her acting ability, some
J wonderful gowns which are sure to
| interest the ladies, and authentic
| scenes taken in and around Central
Park, New York City.
The story tells of the daughter of
j a police detective whose father never
j told her anything of the wickdness of
| the world, and by having her got into
jan almost desperate affair with a
| crook, points the weakly obvious moral
! that innocence is not ignorance.
The Varsity is offering a picturiza
i tion of Charles Rann Kennedy's fam-
I ous melodrama. "The Servant in the
j House."
A Pleasant Evening Ahead
If you want something different in
the way of theatrical entertainment,
drop around to the Little Theater to
morrow night and see the two one-act
! plays being presented by Gordon
| Davis* Dramatic Workshop class. The
| plays in question are "Lonesome-Like,"
| a queer little tale of a great big city,
[ and Lord Dunsany's Oriental fantasy,
! "Tents of the Arabs."
This "Tents of the Arabs" thing is
presented in a bizarre Arabian setting
j that is sure to delight the eye. Both
l plays include some of the best known
| campus stars and—wonder of wonders
i in these days of high tuition and cam
pus drives —you are invited to come
as the guest of the class, with no ad
mission charge whatever.
California's Sun Knocks 'em Cold
One of New York's latest hits is
"Sunkist," an all-California review
produced by Fanchon and Marco, the
well known theatrical people of San
Francisco. The attraction is running
at the Globe and replaces "Tip-Top"
another musical show whose principal
feature was Fred Stone and which
practically collapsed when Stone in
jured himself some weeks ago and
had to put a substitue in his place.
"Sunkist" seems to have opened
Broadway's eyes in the matter of
costumes. Speaking of a revelation
of California's beatuties, the New
yorkers say that a trip to the show is
as®good as a trip to the coast.
