# Professor Gray Speaks At Oakland Convention
## 
### 
Professor H. D. Gray of the English
department was a speaker at the an
nual convention of the CaliforniaTCon
gress of Mothers and Parent-Teachers'
Association, now being held at Oak
land. Prof. Gray's subject was "The
Menace of the Movies and How to
Combat It."
He outlined the history of the situa
tion in general and then discussed the
problem of State censorship and the
objections to it. The fate of the Eden
bill for censorship, which failed to be
reported out of the committee, was
not discouraging to the speaker. The
proceedings made it perfectly clear,
he said, that while reform bills are
usually lost when first introduced, this
one would be fairly sure of passing
the Legislature next time, unless con
ditions are greatly improved in the
meantime.
