# COMPLETION OF STADIUM PLANNED FOR NOVEMBER
## Preliminary Work Now Almost Finished; Excavation Begins 
### 
Completion of the Stanford Stadium
is to be accomplished within 135 days,
probably by November 1, according
to the present estimate. The first
steps in construction will be the
stripping of the surface earth which
will be saved to be used as a cover
ing for the field and the slopes of
embankment. The playing field will
be on a foundation of gravelly soil
topped by three inches of selected
loam.
Preliminary work on the stadium
site is nearly completed. Trees have
been cut down, fences removed, a cook
house is in the process of construc
tion, and some lumber has been hauled
in. It is planned to bring in a large
crowd of workmen who will live in
a camp near the stadium site until the
structure is completed.
The area to be excavated is about
400x700 feet, or a space approximately
the size of an average block and a
half in Palo Alto. The length of the

structure from outer slope to outer
slope will be about 1000 feet and the
width to the outer slopes, 784 feet. The
length and width of the oval at the
surface of the playing field will be
5G2 feet and 355 feet. The area of
the entire structure, measured from
the outer slopes, is regularly 20 acres
and comparable to four city blocks in
Palo Alto. The amount of earth taken
from the excavation is combarable in
size to the New Library Building. The
field, which is to be 23 feet below the
present surface, will include a foot
ball field large enough for either
American or Rugby football, around
which will be a quarter-mile track,
fifteen feet in width, with a 220-yard
straight away, thirty feet in width.
Five test pits were dug some months
ago and dirt piled around them to
determine the nature of the soil and
the natural drainage conditions. It
was found that the soil is largely of
