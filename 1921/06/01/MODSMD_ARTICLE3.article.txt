# COMPLETION OF STADIUM PLANNED FOR NOVEMBER
## Preliminary Work Now Almost Finished; Excavation Begins 
### 
Completion of the Stanford Stadium
is to be accomplished within 135 days,
probably by November 1, according
to the present estimate. The first
steps in construction will be the
stripping of the surface earth which
will be saved to be used as a cover
ing for the field and the slopes of
embankment. The playing field will
be on a foundation of gravelly soil
topped by three inches of selected
loam.
Preliminary work on the stadium
site is nearly completed. Trees have
been cut down, fences removed, a cook
house is in the process of construc
tion, and some lumber has been hauled
in. It is planned to bring in a large
crowd of workmen who will live in
a camp near the stadium site until the
structure is completed.
The area to be excavated is about
400x700 feet, or a space approximately
the size of an average block and a
half in Palo Alto. The length of the

structure from outer slope to outer
slope will be about 1000 feet and the
width to the outer slopes, 784 feet. The
length and width of the oval at the
surface of the playing field will be
5G2 feet and 355 feet. The area of
the entire structure, measured from
the outer slopes, is regularly 20 acres
and comparable to four city blocks in
Palo Alto. The amount of earth taken
from the excavation is combarable in
size to the New Library Building. The
field, which is to be 23 feet below the
present surface, will include a foot
ball field large enough for either
American or Rugby football, around
which will be a quarter-mile track,
fifteen feet in width, with a 220-yard
straight away, thirty feet in width.
Five test pits were dug some months
ago and dirt piled around them to
determine the nature of the soil and
the natural drainage conditions. It
was found that the soil is largely of
sand and gravel composition and pro
vides almost perfect natural drain
age. The conclusion was reached that
the natural drainage will probably
take care of any water, particularly
as last winter, when the tests were
made, there was considerable rainfall
and the test pits drained perfectly.
In order to provice against any prob
lem of drainage arising later, a slump
will be made at the end of the 220
straight away, from which water could
be pumped.
The capacity of the stadium will be
GO,OOO with a possibility of more than
05,000' by the use of auto parking and
standing-room space. There will be
44 sections of about 1500 seats each
and 44 aisles for feet in width. On the
outer slopes of the embankment, lead
ing to the top, there are to be 22 flights
of steps with 7-inch risers and 14-inch
treads, and eight feett in width. An
enclosure will surround the entire
structure 60 feet from the base of the
embankment and six large gateways,
HO feet in width, will make possible
the proper distribution of large crowds.
It is planned to have a barrier along
the top of the embankments with
entrances and exits for each section.
Later on hedges will be planted to
form barriers of natural beauty. By
means of this system of gateways,
steps, entrances and exits, the stadium
can be emptied of 60.000 in less than
ten minutes.
The outer slopes will fall away
gradually to the ground level, lending
themselves easily to the planting of
shrubs and grasses, and will be planted
with native grasses similar to the
fields. The nature of the construction
is so massive that it will not permit
of any attempt at conventional adorn
ment and the broad and gradual slopes
will be much more effective when
planted than would any design of
architectural details. The suggestion
has been made that the slopes and
adjacent areas be planted to flowering
plants which will bloom in the fall
when the stadium is most in use.
A pipe line will be laid around the
center of the inner slope midway of
the bleachers with outlets at the field
and at the top of the embankment.
This will provide fire protection and
water for hedges and plants on the
outside slopes.

of the Pacific International Exposition I

in Seattle. Baker was with the 23rd
Engineers during the War. first as
Captain of Company B, and later
raised to a Major. He saw active ser
vice in the Argonne-Meuse operations.
The plan for the erection of the
Stadium along the present basis was
worked out by Professor C. B. Wing,
of the Structural Engineering Depart
ment during the year following the
earthquake in a structure of this size.
This was a considerable length of
time before the Yale Bowl was plan
ned, and the similarity of the two
plans goes to show that this type of
structure is the most advantageous j
and most economical, particularly in
California where conditions are most
suitable. Professor C. D. Marx, Head
of the Civil Engineering Department,
and Professor W. P. Durand, Head of
the Mechanical Engineering, have co
operated with Professor, Wing in work
ing out the details of the plan.

can be emptied of 60.000 in less than
ten minutes.
The outer slopes will fall away
gradually to the ground level, lending
themselves easily to the planting of
shrubs and grasses, and will be planted
with native grasses similar to the
fields. The nature of the construction
is so massive that it will not permit
of any attempt at conventional adorn
ment and the broad and gradual slopes
will be much more effective when
planted than would any design of
architectural details. The suggestion
has been made that the slopes and
adjacent areas be planted to flowering
plants which will bloom in the fall
when the stadium is most in use.
A pipe line will be laid around the
center of the inner slope midway of
the bleachers with outlets at the field
and at the top of the embankment.
This will provide fire protection and
water for hedges and plants on the
outside slopes.
Shorley Baker, '95, and E. C. Car- j

have been secured by the Board of i
Athletic Control to supervise the con-1
struction. Carpenter was chief civil j
engineer in charge of the construction |
of the Pacific International Exposition I
and Construction Engineer for the j
Sierra Power Company, and for large j
water development projects at Van
couver, B. C. During the War he was i
in charge of large government plants !
in Seattle. Baker was with the 23rd
Engineers during the War. first as
Captain of Company B, and later
raised to a Major. He saw active ser
vice in the Argonne-Meuse operations.
The plan for the erection of the
Stadium along the present basis was
worked out by Professor C. B. Wing,
of the Structural Engineering Depart
ment during the year following the
earthquake in a structure of this size.
This was a considerable length of
time before the Yale Bowl was plan
ned, and the similarity of the two
plans goes to show that this type of
structure is the most advantageous j
and most economical, particularly in
California where conditions are most
suitable. Professor C. D. Marx, Head
of the Civil Engineering Department,
and Professor W. P. Durand, Head of
the Mechanical Engineering, have co
operated with Professor, Wing in work
ing out the details of the plan.
The length of the playing field will
be located at right angles to the di
rection of the sun at 3:00 p.m., No
vember 19, the date of the Big Game.
Completion of the Stanford Stadium
is to be accomplished within 135 days,
probably by November 1, according
to the present estimate. The first
steps in construction will be the
stripping of the surface earth which
will be saved to be used as a cover
ing for the field and the slopes of
embankment. The playing field will
be on a foundation of gravelly soil
topped by three inches of selected
loam.
Preliminary work on the stadium
site is nearly completed. Trees have
been cut down, fences removed, a cook
house is in the process of construc
tion, and some lumber has been hauled
in. It is planned to bring in a large
crowd of workmen who will live in
a camp near the stadium site until the
structure is completed.
The area to be excavated is about
400x700 feet, or a space approximately
the size of an average block and a
half in Palo Alto. The length of the

structure from outer slope to outer
slope will be about 1000 feet and the
width to the outer slopes, 784 feet. The
length and width of the oval at the
surface of the playing field will be
5G2 feet and 355 feet. The area of
the entire structure, measured from
the outer slopes, is regularly 20 acres
and comparable to four city blocks in
Palo Alto. The amount of earth taken
from the excavation is combarable in
size to the New Library Building. The
field, which is to be 23 feet below the
present surface, will include a foot
ball field large enough for either
American or Rugby football, around
which will be a quarter-mile track,
fifteen feet in width, with a 220-yard
straight away, thirty feet in width.
Five test pits were dug some months
ago and dirt piled around them to
determine the nature of the soil and
the natural drainage conditions. It
was found that the soil is largely of
sand and gravel composition and pro
vides almost perfect natural drain
age. The conclusion was reached that
the natural drainage will probably
take care of any water, particularly
as last winter, when the tests were
made, there was considerable rainfall
and the test pits drained perfectly.
In order to provice against any prob
lem of drainage arising later, a slump
will be made at the end of the 220
straight away, from which water could
be pumped.
The capacity of the stadium will be
GO,OOO with a possibility of more than
05,000' by the use of auto parking and
standing-room space. There will be
44 sections of about 1500 seats each
and 44 aisles for feet in width. On the
outer slopes of the embankment, lead
ing to the top, there are to be 22 flights
of steps with 7-inch risers and 14-inch
treads, and eight feett in width. An
enclosure will surround the entire
structure 60 feet from the base of the
embankment and six large gateways,
HO feet in width, will make possible
the proper distribution of large crowds.
It is planned to have a barrier along
the top of the embankments with
entrances and exits for each section.
Later on hedges will be planted to
form barriers of natural beauty. By
means of this system of gateways,
steps, entrances and exits, the stadium
can be emptied of 60.000 in less than

half in Palo Alto. The length of the

structure from outer slope to outer
slope will be about 1000 feet and the
width to the outer slopes, 784 feet. The
length and width of the oval at the
surface of the playing field will be
5G2 feet and 355 feet. The area of
the entire structure, measured from
the outer slopes, is regularly 20 acres
and comparable to four city blocks in
Palo Alto. The amount of earth taken
from the excavation is combarable in
size to the New Library Building. The
field, which is to be 23 feet below the
present surface, will include a foot
ball field large enough for either
American or Rugby football, around
which will be a quarter-mile track,
fifteen feet in width, with a 220-yard
straight away, thirty feet in width.
Five test pits were dug some months
ago and dirt piled around them to
determine the nature of the soil and
the natural drainage conditions. It
was found that the soil is largely of
sand and gravel composition and pro
vides almost perfect natural drain
age. The conclusion was reached that
the natural drainage will probably
take care of any water, particularly
as last winter, when the tests were
made, there was considerable rainfall
and the test pits drained perfectly.
In order to provice against any prob
lem of drainage arising later, a slump
will be made at the end of the 220
straight away, from which water could
be pumped.
The capacity of the stadium will be
GO,OOO with a possibility of more than
05,000' by the use of auto parking and
standing-room space. There will be
44 sections of about 1500 seats each
and 44 aisles for feet in width. On the
outer slopes of the embankment, lead
ing to the top, there are to be 22 flights
of steps with 7-inch risers and 14-inch
treads, and eight feett in width. An
enclosure will surround the entire
structure 60 feet from the base of the
embankment and six large gateways,
HO feet in width, will make possible
the proper distribution of large crowds.
It is planned to have a barrier along
the top of the embankments with
entrances and exits for each section.
Later on hedges will be planted to
form barriers of natural beauty. By
means of this system of gateways,
steps, entrances and exits, the stadium
can be emptied of 60.000 in less than
ten minutes.
The outer slopes will fall away
gradually to the ground level, lending
themselves easily to the planting of
shrubs and grasses, and will be planted
with native grasses similar to the
fields. The nature of the construction
is so massive that it will not permit
of any attempt at conventional adorn
ment and the broad and gradual slopes
will be much more effective when
planted than would any design of
architectural details. The suggestion
has been made that the slopes and
adjacent areas be planted to flowering
plants which will bloom in the fall
when the stadium is most in use.
A pipe line will be laid around the
center of the inner slope midway of
the bleachers with outlets at the field
and at the top of the embankment.
This will provide fire protection and
water for hedges and plants on the
outside slopes.
Shorley Baker, '95, and E. C. Car- j

have been secured by the Board of i
Athletic Control to supervise the con-1
struction. Carpenter was chief civil j

of the Pacific International Exposition I
and Construction Engineer for the j
Sierra Power Company, and for large j
water development projects at Van

in charge of large government plants !
in Seattle. Baker was with the 23rd
Engineers during the War. first as
Captain of Company B, and later
raised to a Major. He saw active ser
vice in the Argonne-Meuse operations.
The plan for the erection of the
Stadium along the present basis was
worked out by Professor C. B. Wing,
of the Structural Engineering Depart
ment during the year following the
earthquake in a structure of this size.
This was a considerable length of
time before the Yale Bowl was plan
ned, and the similarity of the two
plans goes to show that this type of
structure is the most advantageous j
and most economical, particularly in
California where conditions are most
suitable. Professor C. D. Marx, Head
of the Civil Engineering Department,
and Professor W. P. Durand, Head of
the Mechanical Engineering, have co
operated with Professor, Wing in work
ing out the details of the plan.
The length of the playing field will
be located at right angles to the di
rection of the sun at 3:00 p.m., No
vember 19, the date of the Big Game.
Completion of the Stanford Stadium
is to be accomplished within 135 days,
probably by November 1, according
to the present estimate. The first
steps in construction will be the
stripping of the surface earth which
will be saved to be used as a cover
ing for the field and the slopes of
embankment. The playing field will
be on a foundation of gravelly soil
topped by three inches of selected
loam.
Preliminary work on the stadium
site is nearly completed. Trees have
been cut down, fences removed, a cook
house is in the process of construc
tion, and some lumber has been hauled
in. It is planned to bring in a large
crowd of workmen who will live in
a camp near the stadium site until the
structure is completed.
The area to be excavated is about
400x700 feet, or a space approximately
the size of an average block and a
half in Palo Alto. The length of the

structure from outer slope to outer
