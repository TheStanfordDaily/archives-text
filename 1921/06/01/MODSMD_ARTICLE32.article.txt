# "CLARENCE" DEPICTS RETURNED SOLDIER
## 
### 
June fifteenth is the date set for the
performance of "Clarence," which has
been selected as this year's Senior Farce.
1 he author, Booth Tarkington, is very
well and favorably known for his plays,
and this play in particular has been well
received many times. It is in the nature
of a post-bellum character sketch, in the
development of which Clarence, the re
turned soldier with an ailment, ex
changes, finite by accident, his soothing
influence for a new lease on life and a
wife.
He enters the scene ver\ unostenta
tiously with a slight limp and an ill
fitting uniform. The scene is laid in
the office of Mr. Wheeler (Robert Pal
ton, '22), who is the same, well known,
tired business man who is almost too
bothered with liis family to appreciate
life. The governess (Florence Pixley,
'23), although relieving the second Mrs.
Wheeler (Vera Pernau, '22) of the care
of his daughter Cora (Lucille Mitchell,
21), has caused her the much greater
one of jealousy. Cora is adolescent and
romantic and therein lies the tale of Miss
Pinney's, the governess', worries. Bobby
(George Powell, '23), the impetuous
son who has, with no great difficulty,
succeeded in having himself dismissed
from several expensive boarding schools,
comes home and down town to see father
at the same time.
Trying to clear his office of the three
cornered flood of tears, from Mrs.
Wheeler at the thought of her husband's
alleged infidelity, and from Miss Pinney
because of the unjust imputation, which
latter cause is tearfully sympathized with
by Cora, Mr. Wheeler discovers that
Clarence has been meekly sitting on a
settle in the corner during the entire
demonstration and has heard it all. The
only thing left for Mr. Wheeler to do
is to give Clarence the job he came for
and keep the quarrel in the family, which
he does in view of Clarence's qualifica
tion of being able to drive mules without
swearing.
In the time the crew takes to set the
stage for the second scene it is revealed
that Clarence has won them all and, in
cidentally, has almost made their worries
memories. Everything from repairing
furnaces to piano tuning he does with
the same efficiency that drove the mules.
Mr. Wheeler struggles with the problem
of Miss Pinney's leaving and after im
ploring to great length and some effect
is again involved in a clash with his
spouse. When the aggregate rainfall
has passed the 1.7 inch mark, strange
noises arc heard to approach from the
direction of the French doors and short
ly Clarence, who now looks very dapper,
enters, playing a martial tune on a saxo
phone, followed by Cora, Bobby, Din
widdie (William Spiers), the Scotch
butler, who is solemnly playing the cym
bals. and Delia (Margaret Howard, '22),
the Irish maid. The procession stops
and the music ceases with apologies, but
the apologies are cheered down, the in
cident ending when Clarence is inter
rupted in bis duet with Mrs. Wheeler,
who stops crying in order to do plumber
duty elsewhere.
Hubert Stem (T. H. Kennedy, '23) is
introduced at this juncture as a strong
contender for the affections of Miss Pin
ney. Bobby has determined that it is
"Violent—l mean Violet" that lie loves,
father is rather inclined that way him
self, and Clarence is only waiting for a
letter before he admits that lie is that
way too. Stem sees in him the logical
rival and discovers a plan to get rid of
Clarence by identifying him with one
Charles Short, an army deserter. Clar
ence finally breaks down and confesses
that while he isn't a deserter he is a
specialist on coleoptera, which is just as
bad, as far as can be told by any of those
present.
The rest of the play is devoted to
identifying Clarence for the family and
for Clarence toward winning Violet.
The family finally discovers that he is
really Clarence Smith, an eminent scien
tist, so "who's who" says, and Clarence
finds his letter reappointing him to his
position as chief entomologist for the gov
ernment. Violet does the expected and
announces that she has always loved
him, and by the time they depart to get
married the family is so interested that
they have forgotten to fight.
The play is not a juvenile sketch, as
Tarkington's dramas so often are, but
has adolescence introduced rather sub
ordinately as character roles, retaining
in the leads, maturity.

well and favorably known for his plays,
and this play in particular has been well
received many times. It is in the nature
of a post-bellum character sketch, in the
development of which Clarence, the re
turned soldier with an ailment, ex
changes, finite by accident, his soothing
influence for a new lease on life and a
wife.
He enters the scene ver\ unostenta
tiously with a slight limp and an ill
fitting uniform. The scene is laid in
the office of Mr. Wheeler (Robert Pal
ton, '22), who is the same, well known,
tired business man who is almost too
bothered with liis family to appreciate
life. The governess (Florence Pixley,
'23), although relieving the second Mrs.
Wheeler (Vera Pernau, '22) of the care
of his daughter Cora (Lucille Mitchell,
21), has caused her the much greater
one of jealousy. Cora is adolescent and
romantic and therein lies the tale of Miss
Pinney's, the governess', worries. Bobby
(George Powell, '23), the impetuous
son who has, with no great difficulty,
succeeded in having himself dismissed
from several expensive boarding schools,
comes home and down town to see father
at the same time.
Trying to clear his office of the three
cornered flood of tears, from Mrs.
Wheeler at the thought of her husband's
alleged infidelity, and from Miss Pinney
because of the unjust imputation, which
latter cause is tearfully sympathized with
by Cora, Mr. Wheeler discovers that
Clarence has been meekly sitting on a
settle in the corner during the entire
demonstration and has heard it all. The
only thing left for Mr. Wheeler to do
is to give Clarence the job he came for
and keep the quarrel in the family, which
he does in view of Clarence's qualifica
tion of being able to drive mules without
swearing.
In the time the crew takes to set the
stage for the second scene it is revealed
that Clarence has won them all and, in
cidentally, has almost made their worries
memories. Everything from repairing
furnaces to piano tuning he does with
the same efficiency that drove the mules.
Mr. Wheeler struggles with the problem
of Miss Pinney's leaving and after im
ploring to great length and some effect
is again involved in a clash with his
spouse. When the aggregate rainfall
has passed the 1.7 inch mark, strange
noises arc heard to approach from the
direction of the French doors and short
ly Clarence, who now looks very dapper,
enters, playing a martial tune on a saxo
phone, followed by Cora, Bobby, Din
widdie (William Spiers), the Scotch
butler, who is solemnly playing the cym
bals. and Delia (Margaret Howard, '22),
the Irish maid. The procession stops
and the music ceases with apologies, but
the apologies are cheered down, the in
cident ending when Clarence is inter
rupted in bis duet with Mrs. Wheeler,
who stops crying in order to do plumber
duty elsewhere.
Hubert Stem (T. H. Kennedy, '23) is
introduced at this juncture as a strong
contender for the affections of Miss Pin
ney. Bobby has determined that it is
"Violent—l mean Violet" that lie loves,
father is rather inclined that way him
self, and Clarence is only waiting for a
letter before he admits that lie is that
way too. Stem sees in him the logical
rival and discovers a plan to get rid of
Clarence by identifying him with one
Charles Short, an army deserter. Clar
ence finally breaks down and confesses
that while he isn't a deserter he is a
specialist on coleoptera, which is just as
bad, as far as can be told by any of those
present.
The rest of the play is devoted to
identifying Clarence for the family and
for Clarence toward winning Violet.
The family finally discovers that he is
really Clarence Smith, an eminent scien
tist, so "who's who" says, and Clarence
finds his letter reappointing him to his
position as chief entomologist for the gov
ernment. Violet does the expected and
announces that she has always loved
him, and by the time they depart to get
married the family is so interested that
they have forgotten to fight.
The play is not a juvenile sketch, as
Tarkington's dramas so often are, but
has adolescence introduced rather sub
ordinately as character roles, retaining
in the leads, maturity.
June fifteenth is the date set for the
performance of "Clarence," which has
been selected as this year's Senior Farce.
