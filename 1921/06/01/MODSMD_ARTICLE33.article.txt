# WORK ON ATHLETIC PROJECTS PROGRESSES
## 
### 
With three separate building activi
ties related to new athletic projects
now taking place on the campus, it is
possible to see the various projects
in three different stages of completion.
The stadium, the basketball pavilion,
and the new tennis courts are all be
ing actively engaged on.
The workmen's buildings on the site
of the stadium were finished yesterday,
and the excavation work is due to
start at once, as the mules arrived
(his morning. The company In charge
of the construction of the stadium has
IHS days in which to finish the work,
so all the work, especially that of ex
cavating, will have to be rushed It
is estimated that 3,000 cubic yards of
earth per day will have to be taken
out to get the job ready for completion
at the appointed time.
The two new championship tennis
courts, between the gymnasium and
the pavilion site are practically com
pleted. Work on the other six or
eight courts lias been held up recently,
and it. is doubtful how soon they will
be finished. They are to be east of
the Encina Hall, Encina gymnasium
road, near the polo lields, and are
being built partly to take the place of
the courts which have been obliter
ated by the pavilion, and partly to pro
vide additional space. These courts
may be finished by October, but it is
not certain, as most of the effort is
being concentrated on the stadium,
and pavilion.
The basketball pavilion is coming
along rapidly. Most of the work at
present consists of excavating and
foundation detail, so the progress does
not seem as fast as it is in reality,
but the whole building is expected to
be finished and ready for use by the
first of October.
