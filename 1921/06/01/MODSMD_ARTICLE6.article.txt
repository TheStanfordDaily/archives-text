# SPEAKERS URGE SUPPORT OF NEW STADIUM PLAN
## President Wilbur Outlines Honor System Importance to Future of University 
### 
"We are entering a new era as a Uni
\ersity, in student life by the adoption
of the honor system, in athletics hy the
erection of the Stadium," said President
Wilbur, whose address expressed the
two-fold purpose of the annual year-end
assembly. "Stanford is now more than
a memorial—it is a great national insti
tution, and is recognized as such
throughout the United States. In order
to meet our new problems we must have
a new .compact student body, in which
every student must recognize his po
sition as an American college student
and abandon the provincial attitude."
The great step, President Wilbur
stated, is the adoption of the honor sys
tem. In order to make this a success,
it will be necessary, he added, to im
press upon the newcomers, the fact that
the student body will stand for no
cheating.
In summarizing the athletic situation,
W. F. Leiser said that while we are at
present in an athletic slump, the Stadium
ic to be the means by which we will be
enabled to get out. "We formerly had
three factors in our favor—the oppor
tunity which we offered of the best edu
cation in the West, the lack of expense
connected with it, and a reputation for
athletics second to none. Now wc have
apparently only one of these left. We
must overcome the changed complexion
which Stanford presents to the outsider."
The faculty has already aided this, Leiser
said, by making ability in leadership and
activities important in considering appli
cants.
"The faculty is putting a tremendous
moral challenge to us," said Marion Kyle
in explaining the honor system. "There
is no doubt that wc will answer it
squarely. The real test wi\l come when
the present students have left college,
and the task is put up to those who will
come later." The Men's Council is to
have control of all examinations, he
stated, with the power to declare mar
tial law in classes where cheating occurs.
Coach Walter Powell made an appeal
to every student to do his part in bring
ing athletes to Stanford. "In order to
have winning teams in the future," he
said, "we must have good men, must get
our share of the prep school athletes."
The Stadium Committee then outlined
briefly the situation at present. Among
the points made were the facts that the
Stadium means that Stanford will have
the best athletic field in the West, which
will mean the best athletic teams, that
the Stadium will bring great numbers of
the alumni back to the Farm, and that
more and better coaches will be secured
with the money earned. -
"Fat" Ostrander told of the contro
versy with the University of California,
and the decision to build the Stadium in
spite of unfair oppositions His appeal
for a $100 subscription, backed by his
own example, was readily met, and $500
was added by another. Before adjourn
ing to the Stadium ceremonies a motion
was passed instructing the Executive
Committee to turn over all funds left
over from the Carnival to the Stadium
fund.

have control of all examinations, he
stated, with the power to declare mar
tial law in classes where cheating occurs.
Coach Walter Powell made an appeal
to every student to do his part in bring
ing athletes to Stanford. "In order to
have winning teams in the future," he
said, "we must have good men, must get
our share of the prep school athletes."
The Stadium Committee then outlined
briefly the situation at present. Among
the points made were the facts that the
Stadium means that Stanford will have
the best athletic field in the West, which
will mean the best athletic teams, that
the Stadium will bring great numbers of
the alumni back to the Farm, and that
more and better coaches will be secured
with the money earned. -
"Fat" Ostrander told of the contro
versy with the University of California,
and the decision to build the Stadium in
spite of unfair oppositions His appeal
for a $100 subscription, backed by his
own example, was readily met, and $500
was added by another. Before adjourn
ing to the Stadium ceremonies a motion
was passed instructing the Executive
Committee to turn over all funds left
over from the Carnival to the Stadium
fund.
"We are entering a new era as a Uni
\ersity, in student life by the adoption
of the honor system, in athletics hy the
erection of the Stadium," said President
Wilbur, whose address expressed the
two-fold purpose of the annual year-end
assembly. "Stanford is now more than
a memorial—it is a great national insti
tution, and is recognized as such
throughout the United States. In order
to meet our new problems we must have
a new .compact student body, in which
every student must recognize his po
sition as an American college student
and abandon the provincial attitude."
The great step, President Wilbur
stated, is the adoption of the honor sys
tem. In order to make this a success,
it will be necessary, he added, to im
press upon the newcomers, the fact that
the student body will stand for no
cheating.
In summarizing the athletic situation,
W. F. Leiser said that while we are at
present in an athletic slump, the Stadium
ic to be the means by which we will be
enabled to get out. "We formerly had
three factors in our favor—the oppor
tunity which we offered of the best edu
cation in the West, the lack of expense
connected with it, and a reputation for
athletics second to none. Now wc have
apparently only one of these left. We
must overcome the changed complexion
which Stanford presents to the outsider."
The faculty has already aided this, Leiser
said, by making ability in leadership and
activities important in considering appli
cants.
"The faculty is putting a tremendous
moral challenge to us," said Marion Kyle
in explaining the honor system. "There
is no doubt that wc will answer it
squarely. The real test wi\l come when
the present students have left college,
and the task is put up to those who will
come later." The Men's Council is to
