have the same Stanford spirit which can
not witness defeat.
Wendell Kinney, '22, yell leader, ex

yell are:
DIG, dig-dig; dig-dig; dig-dig.
DIG, dig-dig; dig-dig; dig-dig.
Dig 'cm a grave, a grave, a grave,
Dig 'em a grave, a grave, a grave,
Dig 'em a grave, dig 'em a grave, dig
'em a grave,
Where?
Under the sod, the sod, the sod.
Under the sod, the sod, the sod.
Under the sod, down by the Quad,
under the sod.
There!
Immediately following (he student body assembly which was held in the As
sembly Hall at 10 o'clock this morning, the entire student body marched to the
site of the Stadium to dedicate the ground-breaking for the new enterprise. The
Stanford Band led the march, followed by the military unit and the student body.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, President of the University, performed the dedica
tion by turning the first sod with the spade which is to take the place of the
historic Stanford Axe in the athletic rallies of the future. His words were: "As
1 put this spade into the soil of the Stanford Farm I hope that it will start a new
era for Stanford. May this Stadium always stand a symbol to good sportsman
ship and clean manhood."

Ben S. Parks, '18, chairman of the c
onimittee for the local Stadium drive,
was in charge of the dedication, and int
roduced the several speakers. Leland B.
Cutler, member of the Board of Athletic
Control, Board of 1 rustees, and chair
man of the Stadium committee, outlined
the future plans in regard to Stanford
athletics. He said: "We have met here
today at the beginning of a great enter
prise. The Stadium is but a part of the
program which we are starting today.
We are erecting a battlefield which must
be defended by Stanford men, and it is
my conviction that a potential, victorious,
eleven is now within the walls of the
University." He pointed out that the
Stadium had not come to realization by
some mysterious force, but through
united effort, and that the students must
do their share toward the enterprise.
Jack Patrick, '21, captain-elect of the
1921 eleven, represented the under
graduates, and expressed gratitude for
the work which the Board of Athletic
Control has done to make the Stadium
possible. In speaking of the eleven
which will meet California in the new
Stadium next November, he said: "It is
the tradition for Stanford teams to dedi
cate their new fields with a victory. We
will not let the memory of a superman
team dim our hope. Our blood is just as
red as in the days of old and we will
give you all we have."
Professor C. B. Wing of the Struc
tural Engineering, supervisor of the
Stadium construction, opened his talk
with the sentence: "My subject is so
large that I do not know how to. ap
proach it, for it covers fifteen acres.'"
