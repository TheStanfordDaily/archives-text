# EL CUADRO LOSES TO KAPPA SIGMA
## Good Showing Made by Nines In Preliminary Contest of the Championship Series 
### 
Kappa Sigma's diamond artists won
their lirst round in the championship
series, last night, by defeating the El
Ciiadro nine, 14 to 7. The latter aggre
gation put up a good battle, hut after
the opening period the result of the con
test was not much in doubt. Newlands,
heaving for the winners, took life rather
easy in the pitcher's box but held the
opposition to a conservative number of
hits. Purely of F1 Cuadro hurled con
sistently during the entire game, and
deserved better support than he re
ceived.
El Cuadro got <>fT to a fast start, mak
ing two runs in the first frame. Robi
son reached first on a muffed grounder
to third base. Burkhart followed him
on another booted grounder. Both ad
vanced a base, and then went home when
Purdy singled. Kappa Sigma packed a
strong come-back, and circled the bags
five times. Kairchilds and Dillon led off
with a walk and reached the home base
on Rogers' hit. Newlands slammed out
a hot grounder, and sent Rpgers in.
Newlands scored on Dake's hit. Dake
stole second and went on to third when
j Neer threw the ball away. The same
runner crossed the home platter when
Purdy made a wild throw to third base.
7n the second inning no runs were
scored, and each pitcher gained two
strikeouts. Seymour, El Cuadro catcher,
opened the third period with a two
bagger, taking third on Robison's single,
and scoring on Neer's infield out. Parish
prevented Robison from making a tally
by getting his hands on a difficult in
field fly. The Kappa Sigma sluggers
swung the club hard in the same inning
and accounted for four runs. Spires
hit a liner to the pitcher's box and
bounced the ball off Purdy. He stole
second. Rogers drove a hot grounder
at the initial sacker and made first.
