# CARS AND RUMOR FACTORIES
## 
### 
Two points in particular made by Dr. Wilbur yesterday come well
within the field of student action. Dancing and foot-accellerator ath
letics, he pointed out, do not develop varsity teams. Automobiles carry
students away from the campus and detract in more than an insignifi
cant way from athletic activity interest. More than this, the presence of
many cars on the campus makes Stanford look like a "rich man's college,"
an impression that has done a great deal to harm us. To quote from a
recent letter of a member of the famous '95, "1 note your editorial on
Stanford's not being a rich man's college. Hut I do not agree with it
when I know, and you know, that so many Stanford men arc permitted
10 come onto (he campus steering autos purchased by their fathers. I
think 1 can say for a vast majority of the Stanford alumni that there is a
strong opposition to the auto business for undergraduates, and as long
as it is tolerated there will be a hesitancy to come through when alumni
are dinned for contributions." I
To the student who will think seriously there is no doubt that the
automobile factor is not one that is aiding Stanford. It is actually hurt
ling us. We can readily understand it by looking about the campus, and
more vividly by noting a few of the many criticisms leveled at the Uni
versity on the point. Would it be too great ar. infraction of personal
liberty, and too great a sacrifice on the part of a few, to do away with
the stlulent automobile?
The "rumor factory" mentioned by the President is one of the intan
gible sources of very real harm to Stanford. Stanford people unwit
tingly start harml.nl rumors of their own, and in addition pass along
rumors started by sources aiming not to benefit our University. One
way to get away from this is not to pass along harmful stories, at least
until they are verified as true. One oi the favorite styles of rumor is in
the form that Dr. Wilbur intends to do away with something, or that he
is against something. Dr. Wilbur himself is a fairly good authority on
these matters, and is never too busy to inform any one of the truth. The
same is true of Comptroller Roth and the other officers of the adminis
tration.
