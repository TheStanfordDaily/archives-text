A SPRING FANTASIE
Prologue
All nature thrills
Like mountain rills,
I hear the call
Of moonshine stills;
And 'round and 'round
The mulberry bush
The green grass grown
As whiskers on a plumber's mush
While skies above
Serenely beam
The evening's stars
Quite lofty gleam. . . .
L' Envoi
Above I see
A way of fleece
Below . . .
What ho!
A two-bit piece!
Moral
And so to you
We say once more
Don't wander near
The cuspidor.

Hyrum—That guy's the second big
gest jackass in the world.
H.vrye—Scond to whom?
llyruru—Just a minute. How fast
can you run?
