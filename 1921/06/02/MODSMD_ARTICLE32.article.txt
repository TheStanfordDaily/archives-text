# HARVARD ENGINEER DELIVERS TALK TO CITIZENSHIP CLASS
## 
### 
Professor Lewis I. Johnson, head of
the Engineering department of Har
vard University, and a student of pres
ent-day problems of economic and po
! litic-al nature, lectured to the citizen
ship class in political science this
morning. Professor Johnson is the de
signer of the Harvard Stadium and one
of the men who was instrumental in
securing the initiative and refereiv am
for the state of Massachusetts.
His topic was "The Meaning of
Progress and its Content From a 1921
Point of View," which he developed
from the practical view of an engineer.
"There is no true progress without
a goal," he said, "and our forefathers
did have a goal which obviates the
necessity of changing our philosophy
to accord with the ideas of Carl Marx
or any other product of a decaying
j despotism. The Declaration of Rights
of the commonwealth of Massachusetts
reflects the truesf spirit of American
democracy and shows this goal."
Professor Johnson went 011 to show
the developments of our political ideas
which he stated were merely the dev
elopment in methods of voting and
holding office. He said that there have
been three things which we have been
working toward, "religious freedom,
political freedom and economic free
dom." He emphasized the point that
economic freedom is the goal which
we are farthest from attaining.
Economics, Professor Johnsoif de
fined as "good housekeeping" which
he asserted was far from being at
tained in our present state. He
brought out the point that land own
ership should not be sacrificed but that
the method of ownership which makes
it possible for a man to live off the
production of someone else should be
abolished. The present method of
taxation wits another point of attack
by Professor Johnson, who believes
that with the elimination of the non
producing land-owner sufficient reve
nue could be obtained, which is now
wasted, to make the abolition of taxes
possible. "We would make land
owning more attractive and less ex
pensive," he said.
