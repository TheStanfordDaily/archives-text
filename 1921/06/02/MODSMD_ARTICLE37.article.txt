# DR. A. G. VESTAL ADDRESSES ZOOLOGY CLUB ON ECOLOGY
## 
### 
"All biologists are ecologists," said
Dr. A. G. Vestal, speaking before the
Zoology Club, last night, at Jordan
Hall, on the relationship of the study
of ecology to the biologic sciences. In
fact, ecology, or the relation between
the environment and the organism is
merely a systematized and scientific
part of biology that deals with very
much the same subject matter. Some
of the finest ecological works have
been written by men thought to have
had no interest in ecological matters
whatever. A great part of Darwin's
Natural History is straight ecology.
He always kept the organism in its
relation to its natural setting in
mind."
If a horn-toad is heated to 130 de
grees fahrenheit, he will at once be
gin to dig himself into the sand, show
ing the psychological relationship to
ecology. In plants, the relationship
of structure is more important because
the plants cannot move about and
excert choice like the animals. Dr.
Vestal showed that ecology was very
closely linked up with paleontology
and that it was often possible to re
construct the incomplete remains of
some pre-historic mammal by an eco
logical study of its bones to determ
ine whether it was an aquatic or ter
restrial animal.
"The whole story of evolution is
bound up with relations to environ
ment. The matter of natural selection
in the works of Darwin and Wallace,
takes the variations that one finds in
organisms as a fact and builds upon
it the story of evolution."
Ecology is also of importance in the
field of economics. Dr. Holmer L.
Schantz, a member of the American
Ecological Society, was enabled by a
careful study of the correlation of
climate and vegetation and ecological
possibilites in the desert lands of the
Great Basin, south of Salt Lake, to
show the agricultural capacities of the
land. Bunch grass he showed to be
the most productive in dry years, and
short grass the most prolific on wet
lands. Dr. Sliantz is now in Africa,
specially detailed by the Smithsonian
Institution to determine the natural
plant resources and crop-producing
possibilities of large proportions of
Africa, for the use of the Allied Teace
Commission.
