# DAVIS' CLASS TO PRESENT PLAYS
## English Productions Will Be Offered Free of Charge To the Public Tonight 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
"The two plays wlifch are to be
given this evening in the Assembly
Hall, by my class, 'The Treatrical
Workshop,' are unique In their pro
duction, as the first example of what
can be done with nothing but the
hands and minds of the students.
Everything connected with the staging
and mechanics as well as the acting
is a Stanford creation, a home prod
uct," was the statement of Coach Gor
don Davis, in respect to the two plays
which will be presented, without
charge, to the public this evening.
The first play is entitled "Lonesome-
Like" and was written by Harold Brig
house. It is the story of the tenement
boob who falls in love and while earn
estly desiring someone to take his old
mother's place and harangue him as
she used to. is jilted, and not knowing
what else to do, takes in an old lady,
thereby saving her from the poor
house, to fill his need.
Arnold Bayley, well-known to the
campus theatre-goer for his character
work, has been cast as Sam Horrocks,
the boob. He has grasped the part
marvelously, Coach Davis said, and
will be found at his best and drollest
here. Lucille Mitchell, has the role of
Sarah Ormerod, the poor old woman,
and directs the play as well as takes
the woman's lead, which she carries
with the finish of experience. Joseph
ine Terrill, as Emma Brierly, and
Dwight Taylor, in the role of The
Reverend Frank Allyne, should be
mentioned for their excellent work in
the play. Mrs. Betty Shamberger has
managed the play and has had very
little assistance in producing a perfect
set.
"The Tents of the Arabs," by Lord
Dunsany will follow. It is a two-scene
playlet and involves a King and a
camel-driver who are each dissatisfied
with their lots in life. Quite by acci
dent the King gets his chance to travel
the desert which he loves and upon
returning with his desert love, is about
to part from her when the camel
driver enters and claims to bo King
The true King re-enforces the claim of
the false and is left free to return to
his beloved desert.
This production is the most elaborate
of tho two and the mechanical staff
deserves as much praise as the cast.
The scenery was designed by Chysell
A. Dunker and was built under the
dirction of Hollis Chalmers. Carroll
Alexander is responsible for the paint
ing.
Beatrice Edmonds has directed the
cast in this play. Harrington Wells
and Eugene Curtis play the parts of
the camel-drivers. The part of Cham
berlain is taken by Hollis Chalmers
whose performance is especially good.
Supporting him is Richard Blood as
Zabra, a notable. The King is played
by James Quinby, whose rich deep
voice, and magnetic stage presence
makes his performance the feature of
the play. Helen Whitney in the role
of Eznarza contributes a great deal
to the finish of the playlet by her con
fident carriage of the part.
The curtain will rise upon "Lone
some-Like," promptly at S o'clock.
