Richard O. Bullis has been appointed
a« i'cad of a committee composed of stu
dents in the Stanford Medical School in
San Francisco to conduct the stadium
campaign there, and it is expected that
the Stanford students in San Francisco
will add a substantial amount toward
the quota.
The local drive for stadium funds
gives promise of great success, and the
enthusiasm among the students is dem
onstrating that the committee's faith in
loyal support was well founded. The
general spirit is one of eagerness to give
toward {his enterprise which marks the
beginning of a new athletic era at Stan
ford.

it is gradually climbing to the level
of the quota. The present outlook is
favorable toward going well over the
original mark set, and the Committee
is sure that the Alumni are to be given
an example of loyal student backing.

being given to every subscriber, and (this
morning a whole crop of them blossomed
