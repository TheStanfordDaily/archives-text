# "PUPPY LOVE" TO BE FEATURE OF FARCE
## Jerry Powell, '23, in Role of Bobby, Considered Best of Campus Juveniles by Coach 
### 
Jerry Powell, playing the part of
Bobby in the Senior play. Clarence, will
have one of the most difficult of the
character parts. Gregory Kelly played
the part in the original production, and
was also the star of "Seventeen." The
role calls for a depiction of whatever
stage comes before adolescence. Bobby
is a flower which has just started to
bloom, which is indicated by the fact
that he has the disgracefully small
quantity of love affairs of two.
However, the appeals range from
"mere sensuosity" to high spiritual
character. The first is with Delia, the
Irish housemaid. When lie returns home
from boarding school he discovers that
his sister lias a pretty new governess
and that Delia's beau saw him kiss her
the last time. That's a serious compli
cation, for Delia either wants to be en
gaged or rich from damages. She ceased
to be engaged the minute that her beau
saw her kissed by profane lips, and if
she can't enlist Bobby in the role, she is
determined to get the damages.
Violet, on the other hand, is the new
idol. Bobby claims that her high
spiritual nature has brought out all the
best in his character. In fact, lie gets
so sincere that he can never call her,
except after at least three tries, any
thing but "Violent."
However violent his love affairs, even
more exacting are his dress problems.
Spats or no spats, is the question, and
although they don't fit, he finally comes
to the conclusion that tlicy are still wear
ing them in New York, and he must not
be caught without being in style. 'I he
question of the correct way to hold, or
lean on, a malacca stick is second only
to the advisability of practicing with,
well, not a monocle, exactly, but sort of
a spectacle lens, before the mirror, so
there will be no doubt or hesitancy it
a contingency arises, such as that which
would if it turned out that Violet ad
vised them.
