# Aroma of Orient Ever Present in "Tents of Arabs"
## 
### 
"They may be mild and still satisfy,
but gimme a Camel every time for these
desert scenes. That's the aroma."
Whereupon the king shakes all the sand
out of his sandals and tells the chan
cellor to keep the bust of Nero, and the
varnished fish he caught on that trip last
summer up the Nile, well dusted and
perhaps when he comes back next year
he can he Secretary of the Interiorâ€”of
the Harem, or maybe even the exalted
Turkish Trophy.
All the foregoing happens in a more
or less exact manner during the first
act of "The Tents of the Arabs," which
is to be produced by Gordon Davis'
class in "Theatrical Workshop." The
curtain will be lifted promptly at 8
o'clock to all those who are fortunate
enough to be there on time. There is
no transfer of shekels involved and the
only reward asked for by the cast is
merited applause. Don't cheer, men.
Of course he gets back in time and
has a girl now, which proves that Market
isn't the only place where they can be
picked up. They have it all plotted to
slick the chancellor, and remember each
other although they hie them back to
work, both being broke after their sum
mer trip to the oasis, when Bel-Narb
busts in and announces that he is king.
The old boy, who has been carefully
picking his subsistence out of his teeth
the last few months is ready to believe
anything, and Jimmy Quinby doesn't
want to stretch things any longer, so
he says Bel can be king of anything he
wants so long as he and Helen Whitney
can go back to the tents of the Arabs.
