# ENGLISH CLASS PLAYS ARE BEAUTIFULLY DONE
## Dunsany's 'Tents of the Arabs' Well Staged and Received; 'Lonesome-Like' is Success 
### Jeanne Elmendorf, '24 
A new note has been struck in campus
dramatic productions by the artistic
presentation of two one-act plays given
last night in the Assembly Hall by the
Theatrical Workshop English Class.
The beauty of the production of Lord
Dunsany's "Tents of the Arabs" left
nothing to be desired.
The lighting effects of the ylay lent it
an air of the mysticism of the East and
produced a picture of great beauty. The
plot was simple hut the beauty of tin j
lines and the way in which the thing was
treated produced a beautiful effect. Har
rington Wells and Eugene Curtis, as th«.
two camel drivers who hated the desert
and loved the city, were very effective
and acted their parts with admirable
suppression.
The part of the king, taken by James
Quinby, was perhaps the best piece of
| work in the production. His stage
presence was easy and his voice clear
and well modulated. The chamberlain
played by Mollis Chalmers, was well
do'ne. Richard Blood, as Zabra, an
Arabian notable, left nothing to he de
; sired. • As Eznarza, a gypsy of the desert'
who loved the king, Helen Whitney was
j a charming and finished actress.
The other one-act play given, "Lone-
I some-Like," by Harold Brighouse,
I showed a great deal of hard work. It
' was a rather difficult thing to make ef
fective. and was rather overshadowed
by the beauty and polish of the other
play. Lucille Mitchell, as Mrs. Ormerod,
was by far the most finished actress in
the whole production Josephine Terrill,
Arnold Baylev, and Dwight Taylor all
showed that they had worked hard, but
there was some difficulty in understand
ing their dialect and, having oncc under
stood it, to determine whether it was
Highland Scotch or cockney.
The entire production was staged and
executed by members of the class, in
cluding scene building, costuming, light
ing, and direction. It was a decided step
in advance for student productions and
showed that the type of work generally
termed "high-brow" can be as successful
here as elsewhere.
