# AGAIN—THE PINK EDITION
## 
### 
The pink sheet! Sole and only medium of retaliation —the one long
waited opportunity for protest. Once annually, within a year filled with
roughs and roughing, with caustic comment and disparaging co-ed asper
sions are the women privileged to assert their side, to reverse the tables
and to express their views of men and affairs. The one perfect day !
Herewith the women of the staff present to a waiting, and, it is
hoped, a sympathetic public, the rose-hued result of their efforts. It has
been the endeavor to include some perhaps not too complimentary matter
without at the same time neglecting in this issue the news interest. In
some cases he who reads may run —but those who may have felt the
personal touch, we ask to take it not as a vicious attempt, but rather one
to "startle and amuse," enduring even as we have done throughout the
year.
The deeper purpose of the Women's Edition, preceding Women's
Field Day, is to give fullest recognition'to a day set apart for women's
athletic activities, and by bringing these events into prominence to arouse
interest and enthusiasm in them. It i$ the part of every woman student,
if not actively participating in the various sports, to be out tomorrow to
give one hundred per cent support to the Field Day program.
