# WOMEN'S ATHLETICS AND ROBLE GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
Women's athletics at Stanford are an important and vital part of the
activities of every woman student. Interest in sports of all kinds is
enthusiastic and alive, and participation is not limited to a few enthusiasts.
The number of women who turn out for athletics is unusually large.
Women's athletic activities have outgrown Roble Gymnasium. All
the indoor classes of the department arc carried on in the same building
in which they were begun thirty years ago. Other structures' have come
and gone —or have been improved and enlarged, but with the exception of
a new field for out-door sports and the addition of a swimming pool the
same old building still shelters the continually growing and developing
department. And this department is one of the most complete and com
prehensive in the West. The courses are among the best offered in repre
sentative women's colleges throughout the country, and opportunities are
afforded not only in regular gymnasium work, but in all the various
sports, swimming, basketball, baseball, tennis, hockey, equitation.
Up to the present time the University has not found the enlargement
of facilities possible. Because of the amount of building now in progress
it may not be wise to consider the immediate improvement of Roble Gym
nasium, but a solution is to be found iti connection with the Stadium
fund. A provision has been made whereby those contributing $100 or
over to the fund may specify the ultimate University use to which the
contributions shall be devoted. By indicating that their donations are
eventually to be used for the benefit'of Roble Gymnasium, students and
alumni may not only support Stanford athletics as a whole, but may also
help in the maintenance and progress of women's athletics.
