### 
At the beginning of the j ume of the Daily the office of
Women's Editor was added t orial staff. The duties of the
position include direct attentioi taking place in connection with
women's affairs on the campus )n of the work of the women of
the staff, and the instruction o nen members.
The advantages of the art are obvious—better co-opera
tion, more interest on the part >men, and the maintenance of a
higher standard of work. In a pects the office has stood the test
and has pr»ven successful. F1 >cking Mead has held the posi
tion of Woman's Editor durii r, and under her the women's
editorship has been started u\ which offers •ntuch in future
developments.

AFTER ALL—a day of perfc and an office with no cigarette
smoke, are worth waiting for ; ar.
