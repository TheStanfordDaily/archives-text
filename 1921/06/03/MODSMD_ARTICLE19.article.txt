Editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Madam:
in the 1922 Quad, just off the press, I
take note of the mention of a number
of Greek letter societies and other or
ganizations made up of men of this uni
versity. One, however, which is worthy
of special mention, and deserving of
liberal space in the pages of our annual
publication, has been omitted. 1 refer
to thv national fraternity of Inebriate
Rednoses, commonly known in Greek
nomenclature by its initial letters lota
Rho,
For an organization of so large a
membership and such nation-wide and
commendable reputation to be thus
omitted from its rightful place among
the fraternities mentioned in our Quad
is an insult of which the members of
lota Rho may be justly resentful.
An oversight of this kind is especially
significant in a publication representing
the student body of Stanford University.
The local chapter has been long estab
lished. Its active members 011 the
campus number into the hundreds, its
standards are the highest capable of
human attainment, and it represents all
that is most laudable and lofty in the
manhood of this university.
The membership of lota Rho is un
limited. Its welcome is extended to all
those capable of imbibing freely of the
spirit of the organiaztion and of trans
mitting its uplifting and inspirational
qualities to others. Its ritual, which is
in part of secret origin, is commonly
referred to as bootlegging, and its pro
gram of initiation consists chiefly in
having the initiates quaff freely of that
fire and spirit which help contribute to
the, sterling quality of men.
The purpose of lota Rho has long
since been made public. The organiza
tion is founded upon high ideals and
noble aspirations. Its object is to make
Stanford one of the soundest, sanest, and
greatest universities in the country, to
luiild strong bodies and keen minds, to
achieve great things in the field of ath
letics and scholarship, and to make its
members respected and admired), the
leaders of all campus activities and ""the
truest representatives of the great Stan
ford Family in the otuside world.
lota Rho .has at last taken the reputa
tion of Stanford upon itself; it has be
come an organization of wide repute
among the alumni and future students
of this university, and it is the privilege
and obligation of its members to make
that reputation what it will. Let its then,

join with them in the accomplishment of
their noble purpose, by according to
them the wholesome and helpful pub
licity which such an organization justly
deserves. CARRIE NATION, '22.

Dear Editress, D. P. A.. —The women
of the campus are to be congratulated
on the noble spirit which has prompted
them to conduct the campaign for the
relief of the blind engineers. The
men have always rejoiced in the pres
ence of the women at Stanford and
this shows that their appreciation is
justified.
Please do not think that I am cri
tical or that 1 am objecting, however,
if I ask you to make»a slight change
In the object of your efforts. Why the
engineer especially? By our depart
ment* we have two flights of steps
which are both higher and steeper
than those 011 the Engineering corner.
Should not then the geologists also
be beneficiaries of this noble drive?
We do not wish to harm our needy and
afflicted brothers, the engineers, by
taking the relief given them, but we
feel that an injustice is being done.
There is a long distance between
our two flights of steps, Consequently,
besides being blinded, we are always
weary and, often, lamed and wounded
from the mad rushes from flight to
flight between classes. We, except
ing our brothers from Sequoia, who
are in the minority, have farther to
walk before 8 o'clock than the engi
neers do.
Although the engineers have the
Post Office as a drawing card, we have
the women's gymnasium, which has
a far greater compelling force. We
are as deserving of aid as the engi
neers, not only on account of our
location, but because we also have
done our part in building a bench
which —though I do say it myself—is
more advantageously located than the
engineering one.
In closing, may I sTiow that I am not
altogether selfish by making a plea
for an absolutely different group, the
law majors, who though they have
not a corner, have made the best of
the advantages granted them. Their
eyes also have been affected by the
warmer weather.
Hoping that you give my plea earn
est consideration in your pages, I re
main respectfully yours,
G. M. CORNER.

Editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Madam:
in the 1922 Quad, just off the press, I
take note of the mention of a number
of Greek letter societies and other or
ganizations made up of men of this uni
versity. One, however, which is worthy
of special mention, and deserving of
liberal space in the pages of our annual
publication, has been omitted. 1 refer
to thv national fraternity of Inebriate
Rednoses, commonly known in Greek
nomenclature by its initial letters lota
Rho,
For an organization of so large a
membership and such nation-wide and
commendable reputation to be thus
omitted from its rightful place among
the fraternities mentioned in our Quad
is an insult of which the members of
lota Rho may be justly resentful.
An oversight of this kind is especially
significant in a publication representing
the student body of Stanford University.
The local chapter has been long estab
lished. Its active members 011 the
campus number into the hundreds, its
standards are the highest capable of
human attainment, and it represents all
that is most laudable and lofty in the
manhood of this university.
The membership of lota Rho is un
limited. Its welcome is extended to all
those capable of imbibing freely of the
spirit of the organiaztion and of trans
mitting its uplifting and inspirational
qualities to others. Its ritual, which is
in part of secret origin, is commonly
referred to as bootlegging, and its pro
gram of initiation consists chiefly in
having the initiates quaff freely of that
fire and spirit which help contribute to
the, sterling quality of men.
The purpose of lota Rho has long
since been made public. The organiza
tion is founded upon high ideals and
noble aspirations. Its object is to make
Stanford one of the soundest, sanest, and
greatest universities in the country, to
luiild strong bodies and keen minds, to
achieve great things in the field of ath
letics and scholarship, and to make its
members respected and admired), the
leaders of all campus activities and ""the
truest representatives of the great Stan
ford Family in the otuside world.
lota Rho .has at last taken the reputa
tion of Stanford upon itself; it has be
come an organization of wide repute
among the alumni and future students
of this university, and it is the privilege
and obligation of its members to make
that reputation what it will. Let its then,

join with them in the accomplishment of
their noble purpose, by according to
them the wholesome and helpful pub
licity which such an organization justly
deserves. CARRIE NATION, '22.

Dear Editress, D. P. A.. —The women
of the campus are to be congratulated
on the noble spirit which has prompted
them to conduct the campaign for the
relief of the blind engineers. The
men have always rejoiced in the pres
ence of the women at Stanford and
this shows that their appreciation is
justified.
Please do not think that I am cri
tical or that 1 am objecting, however,
if I ask you to make»a slight change
In the object of your efforts. Why the
engineer especially? By our depart
ment* we have two flights of steps
which are both higher and steeper
than those 011 the Engineering corner.
Should not then the geologists also
be beneficiaries of this noble drive?
We do not wish to harm our needy and
afflicted brothers, the engineers, by
taking the relief given them, but we
feel that an injustice is being done.
There is a long distance between
our two flights of steps, Consequently,
besides being blinded, we are always
weary and, often, lamed and wounded
from the mad rushes from flight to
flight between classes. We, except
ing our brothers from Sequoia, who
are in the minority, have farther to
walk before 8 o'clock than the engi
neers do.
Although the engineers have the
Post Office as a drawing card, we have
the women's gymnasium, which has
a far greater compelling force. We
are as deserving of aid as the engi
neers, not only on account of our
location, but because we also have
done our part in building a bench
which —though I do say it myself—is
more advantageously located than the
engineering one.
In closing, may I sTiow that I am not
altogether selfish by making a plea
for an absolutely different group, the
law majors, who though they have
not a corner, have made the best of
the advantages granted them. Their
eyes also have been affected by the
