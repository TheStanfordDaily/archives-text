Can you Camel-walk? They will
be doing it with atliletic gusto at the
south end of the Row tomorrow even

will stage a jazz jubilee beginning at
eight-thirty sharp, and all comers will
be privileged to share in the program.
Tomorrow is the great day of the
Lasuen Limp, otherwise known as that
active, agile occasion on which queeu

reader, upon the promising program
hereunder set forth, and then, if you

Ambrosia Whitmer will pour forth
the nectar for the gods of dance at
one of the temples of Terpsichore, and
equally luscious melody manufacture
