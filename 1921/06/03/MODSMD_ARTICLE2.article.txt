# LASUEN LIMP OFFERS AMUSEMENT FOR ALL
## 
### 
Can you Camel-walk? They will
be doing it with atliletic gusto at the
south end of the Row tomorrow even
ing. Four houses on the same block
will stage a jazz jubilee beginning at
eight-thirty sharp, and all comers will
be privileged to share in the program.
Tomorrow is the great day of the
Lasuen Limp, otherwise known as that
active, agile occasion on which queeu
ers convene to caper coquettishly, and
roughs rouse their rheumatic wrecks
to rag for the benefit of the fund
which the women of the campus raise
annually for the upkeep of the club
house.
Or perhaps you are one of those de
generate souls whose capabilities have
been developed in shuffling the card
boards. In that case hie hither to the
confines of Delta Delta Delta, where
a paltry shakel your gross gambling
greed shall be satisfied.
Cast your eye, for a moment, gentle
reader, upon the promising program
hereunder set forth, and then, if you
can, calmly confine yourself to the
stupid seclusion of your study, or try
to tie your attention to the tiresome
tomes of Tagore.
The very name of the eminent mu
sicians who will afford syncopation
for the frolic is enough to tickle the
soles of the most fastidious frisker.
Ambrosia Whitmer will pour forth
the nectar for the gods of dance at
one of the temples of Terpsichore, and
equally luscious melody manufacture
ers will invoke the ivories elsewhere.
Baccus, one of the most popular
dieties in local circle, will be present
with the dancers, to liquidate dry
palates for a paltry pittance, while for
those of more gormandizing capacity,
food of "the common place variety will
be on sale. Thas is to say, those de
lectable dainties called hot dogs can
be obtained at odd opportunities, and
ice cream cones will be dispensed at
reasonable cost.
Now is you golden opportunity,
seize upon it ere it flee. If you are a
lover of the limpid lilt of the waltz,
or a patriotic promulgator of the polka,
let your toes tickle away an evening
of enviable enjoyment. There will
be something for everyone to take part
in.. If the lady of your choice has de
serted you, come and drown your sor
rows in a glass of punch. If the meaTs
which your landlady furnishes leave
you with a "lean and hungry look." try
a hot Fido. â€”"They satisfy."
