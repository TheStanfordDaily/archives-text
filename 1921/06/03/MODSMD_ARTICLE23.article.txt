# DRAMATIC DRIBBLE
## 
### T. N. T., '23 
We would like to write a column like
Tommy s, but find ourselves handicapped
by a lack of inside dope on Broadway
love affairs and Los Angeles divorcees,
so that we feel forced to confine our
selves to campus celebrities and scandals.
It seems that the real kick of our
campus productions has been concen
trated in dress rehearsals. In fact, it
has been intimated that the low price is
not the only attraction offered, especially
in our more operatic attempts. We sug
gest that they give a course in im
promptu play writing, in order to elim
inate some of the difficulty of last
minute revision, and so keep us from
wondering what was there before the
pauses.
When it comes to leading yells and
coaching Ponies, what more could you
ask? At tryouts, in particular, does Les'
calming presence rob the ordeal of its
terrors. His listening pose as he passes
upon the vocal merits of the trilling co
eds would rouse jealousy in the heart
of the Victrola pup, and is largely re
sponsible for the excellent choral ma
terial which he succeeds in selecting.
Not having been present, we do not
know if he employs the same methods in
Ram's Head productiofls, although the
excellent results indicate that he dqps.
Speaking of publications—we weren't,
but let's do. It occurred to us as we
were reading "Chappie" in Econ, the other
day, that thfere might be some relation
between the law of supply and demand
and the co-eds who are so charmingly
razzed in our humorous outburst. When
people get what they ask for, they
might, under the circumstances, at least
keep still about it.
