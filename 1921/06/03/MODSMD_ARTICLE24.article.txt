Ye Ed received a letter this morn
ing suggesting that the bone "S"
league form a committee to entice the
pennies from certain campus tight
wads, and turn the earnings over to
the Stadium. No doubt these experts
would show their loyalty by donating
a single day's proceeds to the good
cause. •
* * *
First they tell us that treading the
light fantastic will ruin husky athletes
and then they turn around and say
to refuse all others. We asks you,
what's a poor goil to do?
* ♦ *
There is some compensation though,
for one fair damsel coyly remarked
that sometimes a man in the living
room is worth two at the dance. Of
course we personally don't know, but
it is at least something to think about.
We ourselves personally think we
are pretty good, although we are not
so sentimental as T. 1., the campus
Snake whose agile brain would other
wise fill this space.
♦ * *
Own a part of the stadium. Having
carried away parts of the old one at
each visit, it will be some consolation
to know that in the future we are not
carrying away anything that is 'not
ours.
* ** *
Building the stadium will be a job
if we can take- as evidence the be
havior of the beautiful shiny new spade
at the ground breaking. Must have
struck a snag, eh, what, as the spade
seemed in quite good health when last
seen before the sad event. When last
interviewed it expressed hopes that it
would live to a ripe old age and prob
ably grace the Museum.
♦ * *
We see that a caption for one of
the pictures in the 1922 Quad says that
they were laying the cornerstone for
the new men's union. Hooray! We
hope it's true. We'd like to see some
new men.

ing nothing witty to say (she) is ex

sayin's, calculated to bring smiles of
approval to the countenance of ye
