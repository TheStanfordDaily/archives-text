Editor's Note: —From the numer
ous offerings sent in by our mascu
line contributors we have deemed only
the following worthy of publication:
My co-ed friend is pitching .ball,
Some picture I.will say!
Her curves the sporting writers call
The best that's come their way.
I'd love to step up to the plate
And make a hit, you betclier,
I only fear I'd fan three straight,
The man behind would catcher.
If I'd make home and ring the bell
(The parson's bell for mine,)
I'd buy a diamond mighty swell
On which she'd brightly Rhine.
'Twould fit that finger on a girl
Where diamond rings should be
Hut large enough for her to twirl
Around the like of me.—S.G.T., '22.
