# STADIUM DRIVE REACHES $8036 TOTAL TO DATE
## One Hundred and Twenty-Five Men Will Start on Excavation 
### 
Results of the stadium campaign to
date exceed the expectations of the com
mittee, the grand total having jumped to
$8036. Indications are that the quota
of $10,000 should he exceeded by the end
of the drive.
The committee is gratified at the large
number of subscriptions coming in, and
urges that everyone pay as much As pos
sible on their pledges now, as the need
for cash is immediate.
Eleven $100 contributions, and several
of $50 and $20, have helped to swell the
total and, together with the smaller gifts,
indicate the liberality of the students in
this campaign.
Mr. Joseph K. Mickey, who is direct
ing the campaign among the alumni, has
said that an oversubscription of the stu
dent quota will have an inestimable effect
on contributions of our graduates. There
has been much enthusiastic comment by
alumni on the results of the local cam
paign here, and they take it as an indi
cation of the earnest desire of the stu
dents for a Stanford stadium.
