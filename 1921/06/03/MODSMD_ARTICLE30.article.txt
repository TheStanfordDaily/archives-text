# T. GERWIN GUARANTEES PROTECTION TO MALES
## 
### 
The report that Thomas Gerwin has
accepted the position of general manager
of the Mutual Protective Association,
which is to open offices at 444 Encina
early this week, was confirmed yester
day at a special interview. This asso
ciation is the tirst of its kind to be start
ed here and has for its ultimate purpose
the alleviation of the much-harried
minds of the prominent members of the
powerful sex through the prevention of
criticism and % insinuations by those of
the enfeebled gender.
The association is run on a basis of
policies. Each of these im
munity from petty annoyances and guar
antees the publication of all grievances
expressed by holders of bona fide
policies. These complaints will be pub
lished in a special column under the
supervision of Mr. Gerwin.
"This association," said Mr. Gerwin,
"is the most tremendous thing that has
ever been introduced at this university.
Tts purpose is indeed a noble one.
Through the judicious use of the daily
press we hope to expose the evil attempts
and so cut down to a minimum the risk
run by our patrons. We hope to make it
an impossibility for their names to be so
grossly misrepresented in print. Each
and every one holding a polity is guar
anteed the protection of all our re
sources. We propose to make adequate
reparation through our knowledge of
past experiences for any harm that may
come to our subscribers."
Mr. Gerwin is probably the best known
vegetarian enthusiast in this part of the
State. His greatest work lies in the de
velopment of the "Brassica Olercea and
Other Separate Entities," which has been
appearing in serial form in the Daily
Palo Alto for the last six months. This
plant was first discovered by Woppert
Wenny, well known for his spiritualistic

tendencies, who left it in care of Mr.
Gerwin when lie was forced to leave for
foreign parts. Since then it has grown
from a sprout to a full-sized plant under
the tireless observation of its present
sponsor. Mr. Gerwin has won much
distinction for the work he has accom
plished in this his chosen field.
At a special meeting of representa
tives of the various vigorous organiza
tions, including Cammer and Hoffin, of
which Mr. Gerwin is a very active mem
ber, and of Digma Celta Gi, of which
Mr. Gerwin is also a member, it was de
cided that each should take out a policy
as a safeguard against future inroads
upon the peace of mind of the stupen
dous ones. These policies will be pro
curable any time after the distribution
of this issue.

Mr. Gerwin is probably the best known
vegetarian enthusiast in this part of the
State. His greatest work lies in the de
velopment of the "Brassica Olercea and
Other Separate Entities," which has been
appearing in serial form in the Daily
Palo Alto for the last six months. This
plant was first discovered by Woppert
Wenny, well known for his spiritualistic

tendencies, who left it in care of Mr.
Gerwin when lie was forced to leave for
foreign parts. Since then it has grown
from a sprout to a full-sized plant under
the tireless observation of its present
sponsor. Mr. Gerwin has won much
distinction for the work he has accom
plished in this his chosen field.
At a special meeting of representa
tives of the various vigorous organiza
tions, including Cammer and Hoffin, of
which Mr. Gerwin is a very active mem
ber, and of Digma Celta Gi, of which
Mr. Gerwin is also a member, it was de
cided that each should take out a policy
as a safeguard against future inroads
upon the peace of mind of the stupen
dous ones. These policies will be pro
curable any time after the distribution
of this issue.
