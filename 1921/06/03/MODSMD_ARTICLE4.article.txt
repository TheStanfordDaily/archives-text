1 pray you, fellow readers.
Do they make from this stuff leaders?
Yet every club his soul does seek
This neophyte so shy and meek.
Daily, Quad. Pictorial, Call,
Borba is the prize of all!
Chappie first did pick the peach,
Then tliey all began to reach.
Two long weeks the bids rolled in,
The campus satellites agog at him !
One word of warning must be said,
Of him this gentle verse is read:
"Turn not the worm to mad desires
Fanned by fame in ambition's fires!"
