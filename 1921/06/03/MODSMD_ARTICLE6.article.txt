# RELIEF DRIVE ENDORSED BY CAMPUS DIGNITARIES
## 
### 
Among the many campaigns in which
the campus lias shown great interest this
quarter, the most worthy perhaps was the
campaign for Blind Engineers. Owing
to the grand success of the first drive
any further donations may be paid to
the committee in charge as there will he
110 more personal solicitations on the
quad this quarter.
The drive was sanctioned by the Social
Service Board. In fact, social workers
throughout the State are anxiously
waiting to sec the results of this im
portant movement. One thousand dol
lars was pledged on the spot by "Hoopie"
Sewall. F. Looie Venator, Ken Enuf,
Smart Devilin, and Johnny Snibley. ,
Certain women students, whose names
are withheld on request, also gave geti
crous sums to help the good cause.
The campus will no doubt be inter
ested in the way in which the committee
proposes to use the money. Those En

| gineers \yho have not gone totally blind,
j and are stil able to appear on Roughs'
I Corner day after day, will be served
with field glasses and microscopes in one
last desperate attempt to save one eye
i at any cost.
The following indorsements have been
J received:
"It is a laudable thought. I was
I blinded oncc or twice myself when I was
i less sophisticated. I am past that stage
now. So will they be next time."
HOWARD DEEMS.
Past Master.
"I>y all means. Go as far as you like.
SWEDE RIGHTER.
"Now that the co-eds have blinded the
Engineers it is fitting that they do what
ever is in their power to relieve the
afflicted. I heartily endorse the cam
paign." DAN W. EVANS.
Ex-editor of "Chappie."
I am pleased to endorse this move
ment, so pleased in fact, that I am not
using the type endorsement that I give
for all drives. I like to see the members
of the happy Stanford family helping
each other along, and it is meet that the
Engineers, having lost their sight
through no fault of their own, should be
succored by the co-eds. Bust right up to
them, 500, and do what you can.

"The blinding was pleasant, and if the
relief is ditto, bring on the relief."
KEITH H. SWAN HOLM,
President C. E. Society.
"To think of our young men, once in
spiring, full of youth, joy, and life, who
looked so hopefully up the street, wrings
my heart. Help them all you can, girls
I'll illustrate it."
DARL MacBOYLE.
"I have not looked up conditions on
Roughs' Corner, my time having been
taken tip with my garbage dump. 1 un
derstand, however, that the Roughs will
soon be unable to read my column, so for
the sake of a poor garbage man, con
tinue with your campaign."
TOM IRWIN,
Cabbage Emeritus.
