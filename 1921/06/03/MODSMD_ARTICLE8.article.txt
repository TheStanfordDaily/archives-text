This issue of tiie Daily Palo Alto is
j dedicated with the utmost reverence and
affection to our Editor-in-Chief. William
Frederick Leiser, who, it is rumored,
will shortly give up his legal aspirations
to take up voice culture at one of the
most famous French conservatories in
Paris, lie has long debated on this step,
hut it was not until he was recently as
sured by experts on the remarkable
timbre of his vocal chords that he
reached his final decision to train for an
operatic career.
The above portrait, specially posed for
the staff photographer, which shows the
editor in a judicial mood, is a remark
able likeness, and the privilege of print
ing such a picture is deeply appreciated
I by the members of the present staff.
The staff takes this opportunity to
wish the editor every success in his
artistic venture, and eagerly looks for
ward to when on his return we may each
| have his greatest works, with those of
'other great impresarios, reproduced on
j an everlasting record.
