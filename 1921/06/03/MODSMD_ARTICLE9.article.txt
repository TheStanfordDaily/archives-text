# PROFESSOR ADVISES VALUE OF CORRECT APPAREL FOR MEN
## 
### 
With tlje last issue of the Perpetrated
Review off his mind, the youthful pro
fessor was able to give a few minutes of
his time to the reporter who sought an
interview with him yesterday.
"Of course it is the duty of the college
man to look his best at all times," he re
marked. gently correcting an advertising
examination, and gazing speculatively
about his well-appointed office. "The
university man who feels the rcspons
bility of his position will endeavor to
achieve the very latest sartorial effects,
and will never neglect the details of his
appearance. An Arrow collar at all
costs! 1 should suggest gloves and silk
scarf for eight o'clocks, and straw hats
are particularly appropriate these warm
spring days."
He tlien proceeded to outline the latest
New York and Paris creations, empha
sizing the importance of the study of the
art of dress both to the student and to
the professor. The psychological effect
of .a becoming necktie is particularly
noticeable in the reaction of women stu
dents, he believes. If one finds that a
riding outfit is most becoming, it is per
missible to wear one at all hours of the
day, he said (in part). In concluding
he observed that it is only when per
fectly attired that a man can feel at his
ease, and for this reason full dres- suits
arc worthy of consideration for final
examinations. "When once one has
found his stride," he said, "progress is
easy. A young and buoyant carriage
will get one anywhere."
