# FRATERNITY NINE TAKES TITLE TO BASEBALL FLAG
## Phi Delta Theta Finishes Season of Unbroken Victories in Games Against El Cuadro 
### Robert Edwards '24 
Phi Delta J lieta captured the intra
mural baseball championship of the uni
versity Saturday by winning the final
round from El Cuadro's nine. The con
test was mainly an exhibition of hard
hitting by the victors, and ended with a
21-to-4 score. Whittemore, Aubert. and
Carter of the Phi Dolts were the princi
pal sluggers. The Phi Delta Theta dia
mond artists have not lost a game dur
ing the season. Their only real compe
tition was furnished by Kappa Sigma
last Thursday, one run deciding the
victory. Clark, pitcher for the cham
pions, deserves much credit for his work
on the mound. On the whole, the Phi
Delta Theta aggregation has shown a
brand of teamwork that well merits the
diamond honors which it has won.
A close game was played by Kappa
Sigma and the Breakers on Saturday
also. The former team scored the win
ning tally in the last inning. When the.
Kappa Sigma men came to bat in the
seventh frame each organization had
three runs. The Breakers had evened
matters in the first of the inning when
Bailard went from first base to nome
on Stewart's pop hit into right field.
The Kappa Sigma revenge was fast, and
consisted of two hits. Dake slammed
out a three-bagger and Helwig made an
infield bingle which brought in Dake
for the winning run.
The first inning opened with three outs
in a row by the Breakers, and wasn't
improved much by the opposing batters.
The second period was another tight
inning with no scoring. The Breakers
gained a two-run lead in the following
period. West singled and made a tally
when Trace connected for a tlirec-bag
gcr. Peavey brought in Trace. Kappa
Siyr.c lied the score in the same inr.ing,
and took the lead in the fifth period.
