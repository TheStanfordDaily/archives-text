# HANDICAPS IN FINAL EXAMINATIONS
## 
### 
More than a few of us face the task of writing four hours next
Monday morning on a subject with which we hope at that time to be
expertly familiar. At noon we shall take lunch, a little fresh air, get in
mind another subject, and proceed to write four hours longer upon an
examination designed to test our fundamental knowledge of a course
that has required forty or more lecture hours-and twice that time in out
side preparation.
No normal student, accustomed to little more than three hours class
room work each day, and that under no particular strain, can .go through
lour hours' strenuous examination without being well fatigued. Those
who must then take a second examination of similar length are frequently
bothered with headaches, eye trouble, and similar ailments before the
latter period is half over. Only the unusually strong student is physi
cally able to do justice to two professional tests requiring strict concen
tration and eyes glued to a paper fdr eight hours in one day. r eedless
to say, the student who does so is hardly prepared to take a third exami
nation at eight o'clock on the next morning.
If each student who started on any one set of questions in 'the aft
ernoon had taken a morning "ex," although no one would be able to do
justice to the second paper, and although those with stronger physiques
would have the advantage over those with weaker constitutions, each
would start with the same outward handicap. As it will happen Monday,
some students who take afternoon tests will have been laboring all morn
ing on an entirely different subject, and others will have been preparing
for the afternoon paper. Clearly the former are at a very material dis
advantage.
The corrector knows no differences. A student who has had the
morning in which to brush up may get a "C." ()ne who has been weak
cued by four hours' work on another subject may get a mark just under
passing, and in that grade make under the circumstances a better show
ing than the first student who passes with a T, C."
It is, of course, unreasonable tovxpect that all students have similar
schedules. But the system That requires mam' students to take two
four-hour examinations on 911c day seems to place them at an unusually
sharp handicap. One man must run the two-mile once, and another twice,
in the same day, and the latter in his second effort is compared to the
man who is making the race for the first time. There is 110 time between
morning and afternoon to recoup. Students could <I<> better justice to
each course, and to general scholarship, were they never required to take
more than one |nur-hour examination in one day. The harsh difference
would then be eliminated. The Academic Council, in making the change,
would' be moving toward the adjustment and improvement of general
standards. -

cally able to do justice to two professional tests requiring strict concen
tration and eyes glued to a paper fdr eight hours in one day. r eedless
to say, the student who does so is hardly prepared to take a third exami
nation at eight o'clock on the next morning.
If each student who started on any one set of questions in 'the aft
ernoon had taken a morning "ex," although no one would be able to do
justice to the second paper, and although those with stronger physiques
would have the advantage over those with weaker constitutions, each
would start with the same outward handicap. As it will happen Monday,
some students who take afternoon tests will have been laboring all morn
ing on an entirely different subject, and others will have been preparing
for the afternoon paper. Clearly the former are at a very material dis
advantage.
The corrector knows no differences. A student who has had the
morning in which to brush up may get a "C." ()ne who has been weak
cued by four hours' work on another subject may get a mark just under
passing, and in that grade make under the circumstances a better show
ing than the first student who passes with a T, C."
It is, of course, unreasonable tovxpect that all students have similar
schedules. But the system That requires mam' students to take two
four-hour examinations on 911c day seems to place them at an unusually
sharp handicap. One man must run the two-mile once, and another twice,
in the same day, and the latter in his second effort is compared to the
man who is making the race for the first time. There is 110 time between
morning and afternoon to recoup. Students could <I<> better justice to
each course, and to general scholarship, were they never required to take
more than one |nur-hour examination in one day. The harsh difference
would then be eliminated. The Academic Council, in making the change,
would' be moving toward the adjustment and improvement of general
standards. -
