						SIGNIFICANT ATTITUDE

### 
With a large number of campus groups yet to turn in their portions
the local Stadium fund is already over the $10,000 quota, and members
of the executive campaign committee now expect that within two d;iys
the $12,000 or even $15,000 mark may be reached.
The universal readiness of the students to go into the campaign,
which njeans difficult personal sacrifice and quite a bit of pinching on tlu*
part of many, indicates an attitude among student-bodv members that
argues well for the year to come. An all-university co-operative spirit
to which everyone has added his greatest effort has made Stanford pow
erful in the past. The success of the drive making possible the new horpe
of Stanford teams denotes the actual presence of that spirit today. Those
iu charge of the student drive have rightfully made it not a campaign
for the largest amounts possible, but an effort to include the largest
student supporters of future teams possible, to whatever small
or large extent each person is able.
It is not the largest contribution that is most significant; it is the
final "return that will show just what percentage of the students are
behind the big bowl around which our future athletic prestige is to be
built. On the fact that all of her men, and women, push her every
worth-while venture, Stanford success is dependent.

NARROWMINDEDNILSS IS PECULIAR. Have you ever noticed
a man of this attribute who did not place himself approximately first
in the list of real "brows" about the campus? We all think in behalf of
ourselves from the petty rut of group affiliations and think in terms of the
the Cardinal when there is a team on the field, but how many of us lift
good of the Stanford community as a whole in ordinary, everv-day
developments?
