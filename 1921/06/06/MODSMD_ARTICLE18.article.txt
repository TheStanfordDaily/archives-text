### T. R. C., '22 
FOR THE THREE OF US
A beaftiful character study which
even the lir.st warm night of summer, a
restless audience, and a squalling »baby
couldn't entirely spoil—such is "The
Little Fool." down at the Varsity. This
•picturization of Jack London's novel,
"The Little Ladf of the Rig House." if
remarkable in that it has no villain.
Three people beeomc enmeshed in'.a
love tangle yet each is honorable and
each is honest with»the otlver two.
Funny world we live in, isti t it—
i The photography, settings, and light
ing effects are something above the
average. A thrill is supplied when Paula
takes a horseback dive into the swim
ming pool and the necessary comedy re
lief i- brought in by a pillow fight be
tween Dick and the four girls.

A queer thing happened to the pro

: ter, as usual, and then moved to the
I Town Hall, where it blossomed forth in
i conjunction with a new invention for
talking pictures. Gotham refuses to be
! come enthusiastic over the "talkies,
though the attraction continues to draw
I people because of the novelty of the
! thing.
