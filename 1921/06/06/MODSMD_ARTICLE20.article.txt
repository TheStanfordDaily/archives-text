### 
"There comes a time in the lives of all
of us when the need arises for a true,
dependable religion, upon which we can
lean in sorrow, and to which wc can look
in necessity: that need is met. 1 believe,
in the deep and glorious inspiration
which one gets at Asilomnr."
The above statement comes from Miss
Ruth Bacon, local secretary of the
Young Women's Christian Association,
who spoke Thursday at the Asilomar
meeting held in the Little Tlwater. She
described the pleasure which, as a stu
dent. she experienced during her first
trip to the annual conference at Asilo
mar. and expressed her desire that all
of the women of Stanford might share
alike the joy and inspiration which await
them at this beautiful "Retreat by the
Sea."
The first part <>f the meeting was taken
up with ringing Asilomar songs, led by
Per sis Hyatt. There then followed a
moving picture which was taken two
years ago at the student conference at
Asilomar, depicting the life
there, the chapel services, sports, and
general activities.
This was the last general meeting of
the Y. W. C. A. which will be held this
quarter. The number of women present
was considerable, and denotes the active
interest which campus students are tak
ing in the coming conference. A meet
ing of all those intending to go to \silo
mar will be held Sunday afternoon aj 5
o'clock in the library at Rohle Hall.
