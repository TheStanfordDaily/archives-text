# TABLE RESERVATIONS FOR SENIOR BALL MAY BE MADE IMMEDIATELY
## 
### 
Tables for the senior ball can now be
signed for and reserved by application
at the Book Store, according to the
announcement of the committee in
charge of arrangements. There has been
no change in the table arrangement ex
cept in regard to the placing of the
groups. There will be the same num
ber of two-, three-, and four-couple
tables as before.
The court back of the main entrance
to the President's mansion will be used
for the serving of the food to the
guests at the party, making possible the
complete retention of the ballroom for
the dancers. A canvas covering will be
over part of the outdoor dining room,
and the rest will be open to the sky.
An attractive scheme of hanging lights
has been devised to give the necessary
illumination for the outdoor cafe, and
the same general effect will be carried
out inside of the ballroom.
In order that the program of dances
will not conflict with the supper in the
early part of the evening there will bd
two announced dances at the opening
of the program and eight after the sup
per. Tn the waits between the courses of
the dinner there will also be dancing,
but this will f)e off the regular program.
The committee has taken this means of
making it easier for the groups to make
tlleir selections without any trouble be
ing had in meeting with other people
with whom they have dances.
Programs for the occasion have not
been received v?t but will soon be down
for distribution to the guests at the ball.
The}' are of an original design and are
made to be quite in keeping with the
general scheme of the evening's enter
tainment.
