# STADIUM CAMPAIGN FUND NEARS GOAL
## 
### 
Total campus subscriptions to the
stadium fund today rcachcd $10,368, ac
cording to an announcement by the com
mittee in charge this morning. Tlie cam
paign will end Tuesday night, when a
much larger amount total is expected.
The committee believes that an over
subscribed quota will have the best pos
sible effect on alumni and intends to
wire the results of the local campaign
to Stanford alumni organizations Tues
day night.
The list of living groups with the per
centage of their membership contributing
to the stadium fund is published to show,
the committee says, "the splendid re
sponse to the appeal for money to make
a Stanford stadium possible for this
year."
The percentages are computed on the
number of contributors, not on the
amounts contributed. Since all organi
zations have not been visited by cam
paigning squads, percentages for all or
ganizations are not available, and only
percentages for visited organizations are
published.
Committeemen working among stu
dents of the Stanford Medical School in
San Francisco are: R. O. Bullis (chair
man), Cj. Nagel, W. F. Sweett, Roscoe
Chandler, and I. K. Morris. The con
tributions from the San Francisco
branch will be included in the totals.
