# SCENERY ARRIVES FOR SENIOR FARCE
## 
### 
The scenery for "Clarence," the
Senior Earce, will be the most preten
tious ever set for a Stanford production.
There arc only two sets, but these have
been worked out to such a nicety of de
tail that they may easily be said to be
the best results obtained by the campus
designers for some time. Clyde Coak
ley, '21, has designed and painted the
scenes, and Chrysella Dunker, '22, is re
sponsible for the drapery effects.
The first scene is in an office. The set
has been carefully eliminated of all the
hackneyed properties of the usual
theatrical office and is built in imitation
of the president's office of a very large
corporation. The distilled water cooler,
the colored calendar circulated annually
by the Citizen's Mutual, the "This Ts My
Busy Day" sign, and the like, will be
conspicuous by their absence. Exact
ness has been particularly aimed at in
this scene, and the builders expect all
the president's sons to recognize father's
office. .>
The following scene, the Wheeler
drawing room, is the especial pride of
the designer. It is the home of a
wealthy man with good taste, and has
been designed to fill this requirement.
The room in the foreground opens in
the rear into a small sun parlor, through
which the expanse of the Wheeler estate
will be visibel in perfect perspective.
The entrance at the back will be arched
after the manner of the Junior Opera
scenes. The properties have been se
lected with great care.
All of these sets arc being built by
tryoutecs for the position of stage man
ager, which will be vacant next year.
This is a new idea of Sword and Sandals
to obtain the most efficient stage crews
possible.
The seat drawings for "Clarence" will
be held June 8. Wednesday. A limited
number will be reserved for the faculty,
which can be reserved over the tele
phone by calling Local 136, or by seeing
Mr. Vickcry at the Associated Students'
offices, as long as they last. This is in
accordance with an old custom and is
done in connection with every produc- J
tion.
