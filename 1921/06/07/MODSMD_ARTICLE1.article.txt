### 
The ticket drawing for the Senior

at 1 o'clock at Crandall's in Palo Alto
and in the Administration Building. The
performance will be given the evening
of the last examination, Wednesday, the
fifteenth. The tickets will sell at $1.10
and $1.35, including war tax. Reserved
seats for the faculty may be obtained
from Mr. Vickery or by calling Lo
cal 136.
"Clarence" is one of the most success
ful plays ever obtained for a Senior
Farce. It has been popular with ama
teurs ever since finishing a long run in
New York and Chicago. Tarkington is
acclaimed at his best in this post-bellum
character sketch, and in "Clarence" will
be found snatches of everything he is
noted for from adolescence and its ador
ing and nervous parent to love's mature
comedy.
The particular Man of Mystery is
Clarence. It develops in the first act
that he was brought up by cannibals. This
is starling enough in itself, having a can
nibal lady for a nurse, especially as
broken-down returned soldiers have
usually no such romantic beginning, but
when he discloses the fact that he can
drive mules without swearingâ€”well, he
gets the job.
In the second act the full blossomed
expanse of his accomplishments is un
folded. Not only can be repair the fur
nace, but doing the plumbing honors by
a broken furnace is what he enjoys
nothing more than. Turning from this,
it is but child's play to tune the Wheeler
piano, and in further expression of his
musical ability he demonstrates the cor
rect manner in which the prelude from
"Wilhelm Tell" should be rendered on
a saxophone. It is also revealed that he
was transferred from the band to the
mule team while he was in the army. It
is no secret why.
The third act lives up to the standards
set by previous third acts and presents
the culmination of accomplishment. He
is an authority on coleoptera.. Bobby
remembers something about coal some
thing, and Cora embellishes this by recol
lecting that pottery was connected with
his title somehow, neither of which
seems to aid them in their search to
establish his identity in "Who's Who in
America." By accident, his whole name
was never made known to them, and
all the family knows him by is the same
title which was mispronounced by his
lady-cannibal nurse. It is deduced final
ly that beetles must enter the tangle
somewhere, though, as Clarence men
tions playing to them in Montana on
the saxophone. It was to distinguish the
deaf from the beetles who could hear,
that he played to them, the distinction
being possible when it was noticed which
ones left their favorite food. They
heard.
Paul Claflin, '22, in the role of Clar
ence, is especially fitted to carry this
whimsical part. Those who saw him in
the Ram's Head show, "Bubbling Bo
hemia," know his ability as an actor as
being exceptional for a college student.
He has met with many difficulties in in
terpreting his part in this play, as he
knew neither the saxophone nor the
piano. He has learned both in order to
play them when the action calls for it,
and in accordance with the rest of his
acting, does it well.
