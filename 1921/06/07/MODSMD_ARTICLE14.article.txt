# Help! Water! Fire! Cry Brings Campus Heroes to Rescue
## 
### 
"I bid five hundred! — Clang ! —well,
finish this hand. We gotta overhaul the
engine first, clean the plugs and unkink
the hose, anyway. Lot o' time." So you
see that although it wasn't much of a
fire it wasn't the fault of the "little band
of heroes" running the Farm Vulcan
chariot. By the time the department ar
rived, the occupants of the houses near
the vacant lot between the Alpha O and
the Tri-Delt house had decided on
which should be the approved yell,
"Fire !" or "Water !", "Fire 1" winning by
a big majority until the arrival of the
department. After the chief had placed
his stamp of approval, the brush was
allowed to continue burning in compara
tive peace, and attention was turned to
his three-minute speech of acceptance of
the three "Raws" some charitable group
on the hill offered.
