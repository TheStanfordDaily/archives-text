## Neer and Davies Continue in Victorious Tour of East; Milton University Today 
### 
Stanford's tennis players, Jim Davies,
22, and Phil Neer, '22, completed an
other victorious day yesterday at Ur
bana, 111., when they defeated the Uni
versity of Illinois team in three matches.
This was the fourth dual tournament in
the Cardinal men's tour of the East in
which the opposing players were not al
lowed to win a single set.
In the first singles event Davies won
out in a hard match with Hal Yaeger in
two 6-3 sets. Although Davies held the
edge over his opponent, it was only by
consistently clever racquet work that he
won out.
In the first set of the match between
Neer and Frank Meyers, the Stanford
captain was forced to extend the games
to 7-5. In the next set he won 6-3.
Neer and Davies, playing doubles,
were victorious over the George Prencil-
Hal Yaeger combination in two easy
sets, 6-1 and 6-2,
