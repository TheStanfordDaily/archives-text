# WOMEN ENDORSE PLAN FOR ROBLE GYMNASIUM FUND
## 
### 
The growing sentiment among the
women students for a new women's
gymnasium has crystallized into the
suggestion that women contributors
to the Stadium fund specify that their
contributions be used eventually to
help erect a new gymnasium. The
women of the University feel that
present facilities are entirely inade
quate, and it is the hope that the fund
started through Stadium contribution
will receive the necessary additions in
the near future to assure a new gym
nasium.
The following representative wom
en organizations have stated their
views of the plan:
Mildred Maurer, President Cap and
Gown: "If we are ever to have a new
Women's Gymnasium, the need for
which is apparent, we must soon take
the first step toward getting one. The
privilege of ultimately devoting Stadi
um contributions to some other useful
University purpose, presents the op
portunity of starting a fund which
will some day make a modern gymna
sium for women possible. It is sug
gested that all who wish, to designate
that their contributions be turned over
later to a fund for tho erecting of a

gymnasium for women."
Mary Mathews, President Organized
women: "In behalf of organized wom
en I would like to suggest that in
making pledges to the Stadium Fund
all those desiring that their pledges
go later toward a new gymnasium for
women so indicate when ma<> lg their
pledges. The living groups which
have already designated dome other
purpose may change it if they so
wish."
Carey Bailard, President Women's
Athletic Association: "No one can de
ny the great need of a new Women's
Gymnasium, and if the women of the
University wish to indicate on their
Stadium Fund pledge cards the desire
that their pledges ultimately go to
ward a new gymnasium, some head
way will be made toward obtaining
one."
Bertha Vaughan, President Theta
Sigma Phi. "It has been suggested that
the women of the University who have
not yet indicated that which they wish
their Stadium Fund pledges to go to
ward after the Stadium hag been
financed, indicate that it be pledged
toward a new gymnasium for women,
and I would like to endorse the plan."
