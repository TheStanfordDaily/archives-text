# SETTING UP SECRET SOCIETIES
## 
### 
A new fraternity has been organized on the campus this year, self
ityled honorary, and including members from one definite type of living
group. Such an organization, whose members imply that it is honorary
and hint at the replacing of certain well-established societies, is not a
Stanford organization because it is not representative.
Such an organization, unrepresentative and limited in membership
to students of one kind of living group, whatever its purpose, to the un
prejudiced outside observer can have but one object, the perpetuation
of the interests of the groups which it does represent.
Now Stanford student activity, like much of the world's progress,
seems to move in cycles. Men of the present college generation are
prone to get ideas our predecessors had many years ago, and must try
them out again, when they generally learn what their predecessors
learned before them. The new limited "honorary" fraternity is not the
first our campus has seen. Sigma Sigma some years ago was of similar
limited type. This fraternity led to the keenest and meanest kind of in
ter factional feeling on the Stanford Farm which grew to such an un
healthy and disgraceful state and so hurt the progress of Stanford activ
ity that the members of the organization as well as others finally saw
that such a condition of affairs could be remedied only by doing away
with the limited organizations which brought it about. Sigma Sigma
was reorganized, and Skull and Snakes was the outcome.
What will likely result from the formation of this new self-appointed
honor society of members from one type of living group? If it is suc
cessful in any degree it will lead immediately to the formation of a rival
organization whose members are wholly on the other side of the fence,
and with two pillars instead of one supporting the development of the
Farm, the workers on one likely at any time to throw bricks at the
builders of the other, our future would not be well insured. In certain
eastern institutions the unwholesome rivalry developed through the ac
tivity of such organizations has permeated the fabric of the whole uni
versity administration, has even led to deadlocks in the choosing of
presidents, and has forestalled progress and forced backward one uni
versity at least which might now outshine the world. Stanford is small
and compact. It depends for success on till' maximum combined co-oper
ative effort of all its members. Jt cannot survive with two rival camps
pulling against each other, and as surely as one faction sets itself itp by
means of a mystic, secret "honor" fraternity, there will inevitably be
something to combat it. Whatever the purpose and ideals of a limited
organization, and whatever its members may believe, it leads to but
one belief, and can have but one result in the minds of members of other
groups.
Will the ''new era" on which Stanford seems now to be- embarking
be marked by the development of the kind of intra-campus and inter
living group attitude and feeling that was well started when Sigma Sigma
saw what was wrong and reorganized, instead of bending every effort
to co-operative work which may have such results as the winning of the
next llig Game, are there among us men who will, for their own advan
tage, take chances on bringing about the state of affairs that has made
for unclean and unwholesome results here and elsewhere?
The gentlemen of Phi Phi probably have had no intention of handicap
ping Stanford progress in any such way. Yet mystic, secret, limited
organizations inevitably have but one result. It is a serious responsibil
ity on the part of any group of men to set up any organization calculated
in its nature to produce f'esults cutting cross-grain in the progress of a
University that depends wholly on inter-group friendliness, co-operation,
and a common Stanford spirit, for advancement.

MEMBERS OF THE 1921 CLASS will have the last opportunity of
taking part in a regular class meeting when President Patrick calls them
together Thursday. The important matters of permanent class officers
must be settled, and final details of the se*ior picnic and commencement
exercises must be settled by the class. The present senior class has to
date been a living proof that no such organization need die out just
before graduation. An unusually large representation should mark the
final meeting of the year.
