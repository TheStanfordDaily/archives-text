# Mc Dowell Fosters Alumni Interest in Alma Mater
## 
### 
John Ezra McDowell, '00, is probably
the only living man who has met all
of the Stanford alumni. He has not
only met all of them, but he probably
knows more, and is known by more,
than any college secretary, a fact
which peculiarly fits him for the job.
In the last part of his freshman year,
during 189G, he obtained the position
of assistant clerk in the registrar's of
fice and since that time has been con
nected with the administrative end of
the University. Here he began to meet
the students, an acquaintance which
lie has added to until now he has given
all his time to enlarging it and serv
ing the men who are now alumni.
Ever since he has been connected
with Stanford, Alumni Secretary Mc-
Dowell has made his office of service
to the undergraduate as well as to the
alumni, in addition to his stated du
ties. Such little things as taking care
of the Senior Roll and compiling lists
of the members of the various campus
organizations who have kept no rec
ord of their alumni, and supervising a
myriad of funds, are always taking
part,of the alumni office's time. In
other undergraduate affairs, such as
helping classes to conduct their af
fairs according to tradition, he has al
ways been available. In connection
with commencement exercises in par
ticular, the senior classes have always
found McDowell's knowledge of the
precedents most valuable and acces
sible. The success of the fraternities
and clubs has always been a great in
terest of his, too. He is the donator
of the bowl which is awarded to the
fraternity which stands highest in
scholarship and which is at present
held by the Chi Psi chapter.
This service he makes his care, part
ly because he realizes that the under
graduates of today are to be the alum
ni of tomorrow and because he sees
the advantage to Stanford in knowing
as many students as possible person
ally before they become alumni. Since
his withdrawal from the more active
contact which was made possible
through his connection with the Reg
istrar's and Dean's offices, he has found
it a bit more difficult to keep in per
sonal touch with all the new classes,
but he has managed to maintain his
touch to a great extent.
It is Mr. McDowell's belief that this
is an essential in the relationship be
tween the alumni and an institution
such as this. California is an exam
ple of the type of college who has a

new alumni secretary each year, who
is known to only a small percentage
of the alumni. This makes a great
difference to the alumnus, as it is one
thing to receive a communication from
a man who is known to him and an
other to receive tht same one from a
stranger. It was because he felt that
he could serve the University best in
the posftion which he holds now that
he gave up the deanship last year
and undertook the duties of Academic
and Alumni Secretary exclusively.
In 1910 the need was first felt for
a permanent Alumni Secretary, and it
was then that McDowell volunteered
to fill the position in addition to his
regular work as Assistant Registrar.
This called for some extra time, but he
succeeded in keeping up with both de
partments for the time. Then, in 1918,
he was appointed to the position of
Dean of Men and held that office, in
connection with his alumni secretarial
position until he was forced to resign
last year due to the pressure of the
combined work of the two positions.
During the war McDowell did his bit
by serving as Adjutant of the Inter
collegiate Service liureau. This
was established by the government in
order to enable thepi to obtain the
men they wished for certain posititons.
The description was sent to McDowell,
ami it became his duty to scout around
to see if there was a Stanford man
■who was capable of filling the require
ments. He placed a great many men
?n governmental positions while serv
iu in this capacity.
He is now Alumni Secretary in two
i
senses. He is the official representa
tive of the University and has been
re-elected to the position of Secretary
of the Alumni Association annually
since 1910. He is also the Academic
ScMetary, an office which is connect
ed with the President's administrative
duties. At present McDowell is work
ing on an index of alumni in prepara
tion to putting the Alumni Register, a
book appearing every ten years and
which contains the names and ad
dresses and parts of the record of all
the Stanford alumni. Many of the ad
dresses of former students have
changed a great deal, and it has been
with no little difficulty that an ad
vancement has been made in the com
piling of the data. This volume has
done a great deal to cement the con
nection between the ex-student, in par
ticular, ami the University. The next
is£ue will be iearly for distribution in
abctu two mouths.
