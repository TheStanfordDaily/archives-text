# "MARCH COLLEGIATE" IS NEW COMPOSITION BY C. W. MIDGLEY, '23
## 
### 
"March Collegiate," is a new number
that C. W. Midgley will have soon for
publication and distribution on the
campus. Midgley has been working on
the piece throughout most of the last
two quarters, and is now nearly finished
with it. He will have it arranged for
band playing to make it for
use in the fall. The number has an
irresistible air which makes a particular
appeal to the ear when played in con
nection with some athletic event. The
author thinks that it will make an ex
cellent piece for use by the band in the
marching preceding and after the Big
Game.
The first two themes of the composi
tion were thought out by Midgley one
day nearly two years ago. He has had
great difficulty in getting the trio to
match until lately, but has recently
achieved success, and now has the com
pleted number about ready for orches
tration.
