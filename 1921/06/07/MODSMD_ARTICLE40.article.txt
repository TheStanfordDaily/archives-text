work, "The Practice and Theory of Bol
shevism," is the latest book to be re

cally new, which can only be understood
by a patient and passionate effort of
imagination." Bolshevism, he thinks,
will fail. But it will contribute an
heroic legend which will hasten the real
ization of the fundamental economic re
construction, bringing about with it a
very far-reaching change in ways of
thinking and feeling, in philosophy and
art, and private relations.
