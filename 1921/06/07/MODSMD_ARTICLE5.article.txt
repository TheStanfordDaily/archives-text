# STRAINED LEG KEPT KIRKSEY OUT OF 220 IN BOSTON CLASSIC
## 
### 
Morris Kirksey, Varsity track captain,
didn't stay out of the 220-yard dash at
the rccent I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Har
vard Stadium in order that California
might win the national track champion
ship. This question, which has given
city sport writers several columns of
space since the big affair, was definitely
settled today when Kirksey himself and
Jess Wells returned from the East to
resume their university work.
The Stanford sprint star, who won
the 100 yards in the national intercol
legiates despite the fact that he practi
cally limped through the last twenty
yards of the race, did not even compete
in the semi-finals of the 220 because of
a sore leg, the same one that troubled
him nearly all season.
Lane Falk, who with Wells finished
well up in the low hurdles, is already
on the campus. Coach "Dink" Temple
ton has not returned from South Dakota,
where he stopped off on his way back to
California, and Bob Williams will not
return from the East until some time
during the summer, it is understood.
California's victory in the meet was
well deserved, according to both Kirk
sey and Wells. "Oxy" Hendrixson's
win in the quarter was probably the most
sensational race of the day, for the
Bruin star came up from the rear, where
he was boxed, and took the tape because
he has a better finish than any of the star
Eastern runners.
