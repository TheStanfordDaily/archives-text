# PARTIAL RETURNS OF STADIUM DRIVE ARE $12,306 TODAY
## Local Campaign Closes Tonight; Large Percentage Contributes Amount Exceeding Expectation 
### 
Partial returns from the local stu
dent Stadium campaign, which closes
tonight, have reached the total of $12,-
306, and the campaign has brought re
sults far in excess of the most opti
mistic expectations of the Stadium
Fund Committee. The large percent
age of members of living groups on
the Campus who have contributed
testifies to a unanimous desire for a
stadium and the willingness to help in
making it a possibility.
Over half of the amount subscribed
has been paid in cash, and the com
mittee urges all those who have not
yet paid their pledges to do so at
the earliest opportunity, as the imme
diate need is for cash to finance the
construction as it progresses, and par
ticularly the early stages of construc
tion which must be financed before any
large sums are contributed by the
alumni. Payments may be left at the
Stadium fund headquarters or sent by
mail, addressed to the Stadium Fund
Committee.

Construction on the Stadium is pro
gressing rapidly and will continue to
expand as fast as labor and machinery
can be marshaled. This morning there
were about fifty men on the job, and
three large elevator graders, pulled by
60-horsepower Best tractors, were
tearing up the outside circle of the
site. The ground is free from stumps
and ready for the excavation. At
present there are sixty head of horses
at work with a large number of dump
wagons and four Fresno scrapers.
James Quayle, superintendent of con
struction, states that a large number
of wagons and graders are expected to
arrive at any time and the crew of
men will shortly be enlarged to about
one hundred and twenty-five.
The camp which.has been construct
ed near the site for the laborers is
a model for convenience and moderni
ty both as to arrangements for hous
ing and eating. It has all the appear
ance of a newly-erected camp at a
summer resort.
