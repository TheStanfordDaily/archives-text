# STADIUM DRIVE CLOSES WITH TOTAL OF $14,882
## Original Quota Set at $10,000 Is Oversubscribed; Contributions Still Coming in to Committee 
### 
Active campaigning for the local
stadium subscriptions ended last night
with a total subscription of $14,882,
or almost $5,000 more than the quota
of $10,000 fixed for the campus drive.
Of this amount over 50 per cent has
been paid in cash, and it is probable
that a 1 arge percentage of unpaid
pledges will be paid before the quarter
is over.
Although the active campaigning is
over, contributions are st'll coming in
and probably will continue for the
next week, making the actual total
somewhat larger than the present fig
ures. Those who are directing the
campaign for stadium funds are very
highly gratified at the splendid re
sponse to the appeal for money from
the Campus, and feel that particular
credit and thanks are due to those
who not only contributed liberally but
gave unsparingly of their time in work
on the campaign.
The representatives in the various
living groups worked faithfully to
make the campaign a success. Partic
ular credit is due Ben S. Parks, chair
man of the local drive, and the Execu

tive Commttee which worked under
him, composed of Carey Bailard, Anna
Judge, Margaret Goodnow, Mary Jame
son, Harrison Smith, James Petrini,
and Paul Campbell. Throughout the
drive Graduate Manager Ed Martin
worked in collaboration with the com
mittee and much of the success of the
drive was brought about by his ex
ecutive ability and his help in laying
the general plans.
The work of the committee was aid
ed by speaking squads who went to
the various living groups and present
ed the need for funds and made actual
collections. The members of the
squads were. Squad I—W.1 —W. I. Ames,
John Patrick, Margaret Wood, Marie
Hutton, and Robert Cravens. Squad
