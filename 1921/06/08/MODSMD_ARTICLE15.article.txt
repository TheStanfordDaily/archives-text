# PLANS COMPLETED FOR SENIOR BALL
## 
### 
Plans for the Senior Ball that will be
held in the President's mansion on Fri
day night, June 17, are practically com
plete. The arrangements for the fur-'
nishing of the dinners which has been
one of the most perplexing things that
has confronted the committee have been
finished and all the guests will be amply
provided for. The court that is in the
rear of the President's house will be
lighted from the sides in a manner that
will give the most beautiful illuminating
effects and yet be light enough to make
the dining saloon attractive. The idea
of utilizing the outside enclosure for the
banquet is to get the summer effect that
will be the main theme of the entertain
ment.
Between the courses when the dancing
is not in not in progress there will be a
varied entertainment offered by the spe
cial group of artists that tare being ob
tained for the occasion. Some excel
lent numbers are promised by those
who will entertain the diners.
Inside of the mansion will be the main
dancing ballroom, while among the
tables, if it can be so arranged, there will
be also provided space for dancing.
Paul McCoy's complete orchestra from
the Hf)tel Oakland will be down for the
party. It is seldom that McCoy takes
his famous collection of music purveyors
across the bay, and it was only after the
hardest work that the committee on the
Senior Ball got him to bring his com
plete organization to the campus.
