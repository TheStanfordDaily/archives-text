# FORMER STUDENT GETS EUROPEAN APPOINTMENT
## 
### 
E. J. Swift, a former Stanford stu
dent, who was comptroller of the Ameri
can Red Cross in Montenegro when
Professor H. R. Fairclough was in
charge of the work as commissioner, has
recently been appointed director of per
sonnel for the A. R. C. in all Europe.
Major Swift writes that the operations
of the A. R. C. in Europe are now
mainly confined to child welfare work.
In this field, following up the work
initiated by Professor Fairclough and his
associates, the organization has outlined
further plans for both Montenegro and
Albania. The work will be continued
until the spring of 1922.
