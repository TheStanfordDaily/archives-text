# TRAINING STANFORD MEN
## 
### 
A university offers to the students who attend it, an education.
Often this classroom learning. Scientific instruction is, of course,
the fundamental basis of a college education. There are among us stu
dents who attend the University for scientific learning alone. They
expect on leaving college to spend their time in laboratories and in
research work, to devote their lives to science. It is the duty of the
University to prepare these men for the life work they have chosen.
But most students are not scientists. They are here to obtain just
a little broader view of the world, its people, and, perhaps, human nature.
The duty of the University is to prepare these-men first of all to take a
helpful part in the lives of the communities to which they will eventually
be a part of. Initiative, independent thought, willingness to act and to
get along with fellow men must be developed: if their education is suc
cessful.
Classroom work alone will not produce these qualities. The follow
ing of instructions for fifteen or more hours of credit each quarter will
not build the alert, independent, resourceful citizen.
Initiative and leadership are develojx'd with responsibility. In ac
cordance with the measure of power allotted students of a university,
they develop interest in activity and leadership among themselves. Stu
dents do not always—in fact, they often are not able —to conduct their
own affairs as accurately and as efficiently as other organizations might.
But the criticism of inefficiency in the same way is leveled against democ
racy itself, and Stanford is engaged in producing citizens of a democracy.
The jxilicy of the administration in delegating all responsibility in
disciplinary matters, from infraction of ordinary rules of conduct to
classroom honesty, is undoubtedly promoted on this basis. Step by step
cidditional responsibility is allotted to the student body collectively and
individually, and bit by bit the students are taking hold, and are not only
satisfying the demands of their tasks, but are preparing in earnest for
a part in the world itself. May the ix)licy of the University continue to
be that of delegating control of every i>ossible power and function to
Stanford students. Teach them the technical and scientific rules and
learning of their vocation? Certainly! And teach them to take charge
of and conduct their own affairs —prepare them for citizenship in a
democracy.
