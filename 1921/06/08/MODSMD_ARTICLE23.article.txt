# AIM FOR LOWER COSTS
## 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore is granted a monopoly on the campus that
any business man would pay for in large figures. It is so located that
.students must buy practically all supplies at its counters. It is guaranteed
a business volume of many thousands of dollars. It would be able to
furnish supplies at a cost considerably lower than the figures of outside
firms. Students find that many articles may be had at a shade lighter
expense elsewhere than on the campus.
This does not necessarily mean that any one is making great profits
from the operation of the Bookstore. There are no shareholders except
to the extent of the very few dollars necessary to make the business legal.
It is intended to be a public-service organization. Yet the premise re
mains that prices here are at least just as great as elsewhere.
A certain amount of "profits" arc distributed annually to purchasers
who keep the price coupons until the rate of return is declared. This
saving of coupons is a tedious process and of such a nature that not a
great portion of purchasers make use of it.
A majority of the students, if the Daily may speak for them, would
prefer that the Bookstore, since it is a public-service corporation, aim to
furnish supplies at the lowest minimum prices, designed to cover the
cost of maintenance and operation with only a safe margin. The profit
sharing plan might be abandoned for it benefits not many of us in its
present form. What surplus accumulates each year might well be set
'aside for a worthy scholarship fund.
Bookstores in many colleges are cooperative enterprises operated
by students in competition with outside firms. In many cases they are
able to undersell competitors and yet [trove an immense source of rev
enue to the treasury of the associated students.
There has been a great deal of criticism of the Stanford fjookstore,
some just, and much unjust. Yet it seems clear that an organization
with a complete monopoly on the selling of necessary supplies to mem
bers of the Stanford community should be able to provide articles at
costs materially loiucr than those of outside firms operating for profit,
and should still be able, as similar organizations are, to accumulate a
considerable surplus each year.
