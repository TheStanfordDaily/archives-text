# THE 						GRADUATE MANAGER
## 
### 
A full time graduate manager was this year for the first time ap
pointed by the Board of Athletic Control. Edward R. Martin in the
office has proved the wisdom of this action of the Hoard, and the full
time aspect of the position is undoubtedly definitely established.
Completion of the new stadium will of necessity bring a general
enlargement of competition, control of which is the graduate manager's
province. With increased duties and even heavier responsibilities than
formerly the need of a competent director who devotes hi.s whole time
to proper conduct of competition more than ever connotes the fore
sightedness of the I'oard in providing an officer prepared to assume
these responsibilities. The graduate manager has been shifted about
considerably this year in quest of a suitable office, but we hope to see
him more comfortably established in the near future.

A PERMANENT CLASS SECRETARY, to call the 1921 reunion
two years from after the coming commencement exercises, and a class
member of the Alumni Advisory I'oard must be chosen by the Senior
class tomorrow. The details of the senior picnic must be decided. ( More
than a hundred seniors have signed for attendance.) Complete details
of the senior week activities and the commencement exercises will be
finally announced. There are matters of interest to every member of the
graduating class, and the 1 () 21 people should in their last meeting break
all records for attendance.
<$><$><§,
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AETER ITS peculiar custom
announces confirmation of the election of yell leader and R. C. Connolly,
'22, now holds that title for next year. Connolly will have a strenuous
year in keeping up the pace set by his chief, Wendell Kinney, '21. during
lhc season just closed. No man has ever put more time and energy into
the work of conducting the bleachers, and none was ever more success
ful. The rooting section activity at the more important contests, the
big-game in particular, has set a standard that will be hard to equal.
No official is in a better position to aid in promoting the right sort of
Stanford spirit than a hard working yell leader.
