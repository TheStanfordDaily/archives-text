A few days ago two men were talking
over the possibility of organizing a so
ciety for the discussion of social and
economic problems. One of them said:
"Such action would be very unwise be
cause of the very intolerant attitude of
the students and professors toward those
who think for themselves. Of course it
is all right to discuss academic questions,
such as the classic one, 'Resolved, that
the dishrag is more useful than the
broom,' but to discuss the really perti
nent problems of society is frowned upon
by this intellectual community."
I think it was Elbert Hubbard who
said, "only small fish travel in schools."
It is a true analogy to say that only small
minds think as the crowd thinks, as
policy dictates.
What, may I ask, should be the policy
of the University in this regard? Should
it instill into the minds of students the
idea that whatever exists must not be
tampered with; that anyone who dares
think a new thought or advocate a
change in the social system is to be
shunned? Or is it the to be the function
of the University to sharpen the minds
of men to think for themselves and for
mulate their own opinions; to dare to
oppose the existing order if they think it
wrong; to stand by it loyally if they
think it right; to stand for their con
victions and go to prison, if need be, for
their principles?
All progress grows out of radical
ideas. Where would Christianity be to
day if Jesus Christ had not opposed the
old order of things? Where would
Protestantism be today if Martin Luther
had not had the courage to die for his
convictions? Where would modern
transportation be if George Stephenson
and Robert Fulton had not had the cour
age to face the ridicule of their contem
poraries? Where would electrical de
velopment be today if Edison and Mar
coni had not had the genius to carry out
their own ideas? Where would this
American commonwealth be today if
certain well-remembered men of 1776
had not had the courage of their convic
tions?
1 say it is the function and the duty of
the University to produce non-conform
ists. It is only by such men that the
world progresses. The world does not
need college men to maintain any order
or stage of development. Fools can do
that. College men are needed to break
down existing orders and to initiate new
stages of development.
Dr. Jordan once said: "Freedom is the
right to believe what one thinks, to say
what he thinks, to write what be thinks,
and above all to know the truth."

minds think as the crowd thinks, as
policy dictates.
What, may I ask, should be the policy
of the University in this regard? Should
it instill into the minds of students the
idea that whatever exists must not be
tampered with; that anyone who dares
think a new thought or advocate a
change in the social system is to be
shunned? Or is it the to be the function
of the University to sharpen the minds
of men to think for themselves and for
mulate their own opinions; to dare to
oppose the existing order if they think it
wrong; to stand by it loyally if they
think it right; to stand for their con
victions and go to prison, if need be, for
their principles?
All progress grows out of radical
ideas. Where would Christianity be to
day if Jesus Christ had not opposed the
old order of things? Where would
Protestantism be today if Martin Luther
had not had the courage to die for his
convictions? Where would modern
transportation be if George Stephenson
and Robert Fulton had not had the cour
age to face the ridicule of their contem
poraries? Where would electrical de
velopment be today if Edison and Mar
coni had not had the genius to carry out
their own ideas? Where would this
American commonwealth be today if
certain well-remembered men of 1776
had not had the courage of their convic
tions?
1 say it is the function and the duty of
the University to produce non-conform
ists. It is only by such men that the
world progresses. The world does not
need college men to maintain any order
or stage of development. Fools can do
that. College men are needed to break
down existing orders and to initiate new
stages of development.
Dr. Jordan once said: "Freedom is the
right to believe what one thinks, to say
what he thinks, to write what be thinks,
and above all to know the truth."
The winds of freedom blow!
