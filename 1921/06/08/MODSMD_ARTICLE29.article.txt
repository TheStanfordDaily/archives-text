Merriment from Mary
Mary Pick ford is hack again, and she
is jut»t as charming as ever—that's all
you need to know about "Through the
Back Door." The story is loose jointed
and episodic, but a funny thing about it
is that it manages to keep you interested
Ujost of the time, regardless of its
v&garies.
Of course Mary is more or less the
whole show, and deservedly so. She is
at her best when playing the little girl of
ten years, and the illusion of her small
ness is perfect. Her attempt to scrub
the farmhouse floor by strapping the
brushes to her feet, and her adventure
with the fish are high lights in a fine vein
of comedy which pervades the whole
picture.
Legitimate Entertainment
For those who like straight dramatics
there are some good offerings up in the
city just now. Chief among these is
Sir James M. Harrie's new play, "Mary
Rose." which is at the Columbia, with
Ruth Chatterton and the original New
York cast. Barrie's qualities of make
believe and whimsical fancy are promi
nent in this play, and in addition some
critics detect in it a note of ironic sad
ness which seems strange in Barrie, but
which is interesting none the less.
The Alcazar offers Nancy Fair in
"Lilac Time," a sweetly tragic thing
which has been one of the outstanding
hits of the past decade, and which estab
lished Jane Cowl's reputation as the
greatest tear artist on the American
stage. The Maitland comes into line
with Bjornston's "The Gauntlet," a sup
posedly highbrow play dealing with that
perennially intriguing question — the
single moral standard.
Gimme Them Papers
Bayard Veiller's instinct for melo
drama asserts itself in "The Last Card,"
which is May Allison's starring vehicle
down at the Varsity. The author of
those famous stage thrillers, "Within
,the Law" and "The Thirteenth Chair,"
directed this picture, and all the familiar
trappings of melodrama are present.
There are the monogrammed cigarettes
found on the dead body, the innocent
man in prison, and the woman on the
outside battling for his freedom, and
"the gripping courtroom scene with its
smashing climax."
May Allison lends a humanizing ele
ment to a rather artificial production by
her sincere and effective portrayal of the
wife, and some very good comedy cen
ters around the little boy in the story.
The picture is six reels in length, but
could have been improved by being cut
to five, thus speeding up the action.
