# ALLEN PLAYS NUMBERS BY FAMOUS RUSSIAN
## 
### 
Numbers by Borodin, the noted Rus
sian composer, were featured by Warren
D. Allen, University organist, at bis re
cital in the Memorial Church yester
day. Borodin made his name famous
not only in the musical world but in the
scientific as well. He was considered
one of the most naturalistic composers
of the modern Russian school. A num
ber by Louis Vierne, the famous organist
at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, was
also on Allen's program. The program
today was:
March from "Die Meistersinger"
Wagner
Three Pieces Alexander Borodin
At the Convent
Nocturne
Reverie
Scherzo from the First Symphony
Louis Vierne
Nuptial Postlude Alexandre Guilmant
Allen's Sunday program will contain
many numbers of note. In the "Chant
Negro" by Kramer, to be played then,
Kramer has caufdit the spirit of the
negro ritual in a delightful composition
that is yet entirely original, and uses no
actual negro folksong material. The
"Bridal Song" by Goldmark, the great
Hungarian composer, is a joyous num
ber. Goldmark is chiefly known for his
"Wedding Symphony," the overture
"Sakuntala," and "The Queen of Sheba."
The Finale in D major by Jacques Lcni
mens will also be played at the Sunday
recital. Lemmens, the great Belgian or

upon them. Sunday's program will be:
Prelude and Fugue in C minor Bach

Tempered Claricord") Bach
