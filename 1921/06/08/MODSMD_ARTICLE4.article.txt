## 
### 
Yoo hoo, Skinnay! C'mon overâ€”band,
strawb'ry shortcake, an' ever'thing!
Yeah, fellers, we're gonna have a swell
ole party. All the '21 kids are gonna be
there, an' they call it the Senior Prom
enade, 'cause everybody walks around
the inner Quad, like a p'rade. All
kindsa fun!
For the senior class will play about
together for the last time, before facing
the crool world, when the Senior Prom
is given on June 18 as the final event of
Senior Week. Bathed in the gossamer
rays of the moon, the haughty senior
will escort his lady fair about the arched
colonnades, the entrancing music of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
combining with the natural beauty of the
scene to weave a mystic spell about them.
The oases in the middle of tire quad will
be devoted to delectable culinary deli
cacies.
