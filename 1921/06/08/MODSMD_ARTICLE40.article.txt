# LIBRARY RECEIVES BOOK COLLECTION OF FRENCH WRITER
## 
### 
Stanford University has just received
from Paris the very valuable personal
library of Eugene Lintilhac, the his
torian of the French drama, which it
purchased when the library came upon
the market following the death of M.
Lintilhac.
The library contains more than 5000
titles, and besides volumes on the French
drama and literature, in which fields M.
Lintilhac was a specialist, contains books
dealing with the ancient classics, French
law, and some on sports, in all of wjiich
he was also interested.
Lintilhac is particularly known as the
historian of the French drama, his chief
work being "The History of the Theater
in France," in five volumes. He also
was the author of standard works on
Lesage and Beaumarchais. In addition
he wrote on the history of French litera
ture and on the classics. He was a pro
fessor of literature, a senator, and at
one time vice-president of the French
senate. It was said of him that he was
"The specialist of all the specialists."
His personal library is particularly rich
in volumes dealing with the French
drama, but contains valuable works deal
ing with his other interests. Many of
the books contain illuminating annota
tions inserted by him.
The library was brought to the atten
tion of Stanford by Edouard Champion,
the Paris book dealer, through whom
the University has obtained many val
uable additions to its library. In a let
ter to Librarian George T. Clark, M.
Champion makes the following com
ments on Lintilhac and his library:
"Professor Lintilhac's library was a
true reflex of himself. 'Sorbonnard
Lettre' he had collected Greek and Latin
classics and was very fond of reading in
the original. He once made a citation
in an address to the Senate, and some
one interrupted him with the remark,
'Do not speak English; speak French.'
"Besides his 'Histoire du Theatre en
P'rance,' his principal works are devoted
to the study of Lesage and Beaumar
chais, and you will thus have in that li
brary almost all that has been printed
about these two great authors. Many
of them are annotated in Lintilhac's own
handwriting, and several are really pre
cious. In addition to the literary and
theatrical wotks there is an important
stock of reports on public instruction
which he, as senator, collected in inform-
I ing himself for his duties as a member
! of the Ministry of Education.
"I wish to add that, with the idea of
keeping himself in good shape physically,
he made it a point to be a sportsman
(although I doubt if the excellent sena
tor ever rode the mildest wooden horse).
Consequently his library contains a lot of
sports books. In this same connection,
he was a passionate 'Auvergnat,' and had
a considerable number of books on his
country. Professor Lintilhac annotated
not only the works of authors which he
read in preparation of his own books,
but his own works as well are annotated
and corrected. He was the kind of a
man who reads his own works.
"I feel sure that for all these reasons
and others his library is in a good place
at Stanford ,and T am very glad that you
have succecded in your purchase."
