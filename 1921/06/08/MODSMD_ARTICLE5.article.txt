# "CLARENCE" SEAT SALE IS OPENED
## Final Rehearsals for Senior Farce of Next Week Will Be Held Friday Afternoon 
### 
The sale of seats for the Senior
Farce, which is to he given the even
of. the last final examination, opened
today at 1 o'clock. As a usual thing
the Senior play is not as successful
from a financial viewpoint as the other
plays, due to the fact that it comes at
a rather inauspicious time, but "Clar
ence" has started out to set a new
precedent.
.Rehearsals for the show will be over
Friday in order to give the cast a
chance to prepare for finals. At the
present time the action has been per
fected, and the lines almost learned.
Coach Davis expects easily to com
plete the play and have it ready for
presentation.
One of the best exhibitions of acting
is given by Lucille Mitchell, who plays
the part of Cora. Cora is on the sun
ny side of seventeen and has a brother
and a romantic disposition. She tells
father all about how her brother kissed
the maid and that the maid wants dam
ages or an engagement. In other words,
she is a typical small sister. Her love
affairs are a constant source of worry.
To begin with she is in love with a
grass widower and at the last curtain
it is Clarence who has claim to her
whole soul, although he is leaving to
be married.
Miss Mitchell has the voice and the
style and the ability to work, and the
result is evident. The interpretation
that she has given the part has satis
fied Coach Davis in every respect. Miss
Mitchell colors every bit of her part
with her own personality.
On the whole, the parts are handled
by a cast of such individual talent that
all remains to be done is to co-ordinate
Florence Pixley, as Cora's gov
erness, Miss Pinney, has her scenes
very well in hand. Mrs. Wheeler,
played by Vera Pernau, is a veritable
sprinkler of tears, a characteristic
which makes it difficult to keep the
part from the ridiculous, but which
Miss Pernau does very well. The vi
gor and perfection of the Scotch and
Irish brogues of the butler and maid,
respectively, will surprise the campus
playgoers. The butler is played by
William Shiels, and the maid, by Mar
garet Howard.
