# MILTON PLAYERS LOSE TO DAVIES AND NEER DUO
## Stanford Court Pair's String of Victories Uninterrupted By Tournament in East 
### 
Stanford's tennis team continued their
long string of victories in the East yes
terday by handing out a defeat to the
Milton University squad of Milton, Wis
consin. The Cardinal players completely
outclassed the Wisconsin players in the
dual tournament yesterday, and at no
time during the contest were they in
danger, Stanford winning all sets by a
wide margin.
In the singles matches, Captain Phil
Neer allowed the Milton University
player, A. K. Daland, only one game
through the entire two sets played, the
match going to Neer, 6-1, 6-0. Daland
started with a stubborn defense against
the game of the Cardinal captain, but
soon tired and in the last set, Neer had
no trouble in placing the hall where he
wished.
Neer and Davies were at their best
against Milton University in the doubles
matches and the Wisconsin combination
of Daland and C. S. Oakland was
crushed by the driving game exhibited
by the Stanford pair. Davies played an
especially effective game is the doubles
and his hard smashing and driving game
featured the contest. Oakland for Mil
ton University played a good game but
not up to the standard set by Neer and
Davies.
Tn the dual matches played with the
Middle Western universities, the Stan
ford players have not lost a tournament
to date, having won every set of tennis
played. Starting with the Pacific Coast
Conference meet at Eugene, Oregon, on
May 20 and 21, the Stanford team won
the Conference singles title for the sec
ond consecutive year through the ef
forts of Jimmy Davies. Following this,
the Multnomah Athletic Club of Port
land fell before the playing of the Stan
ford pair.
The only match of the trip lost by the
Cardinal players so far was the tourna
ment with the University of Washing
ton. Here, the team had been forced to
travel all night and were not in the best
of condition. A return match has been
scheduled with Washington for the home
stretch of the Eastern trip.
Since the match with the University
of Washington, the Stanford players
have defeated the Spokane Amateur
Athelctic Club of Spokane, Washington,
the Universtiy of Minnesota, the Uni
versity of Chicago, Washington Park
Tennis Club of Milwaukee, the Uni
versity of Illinois, and Milton Univer
sity, without tile loss of a set. At Chi
cago, the Big Ten doubles champions
were defeated, while the Minnesota and
Wisconsin singles champions were de
feated in turn at the University of Min
nesota and the Washington Park Tennis
Club.

the University of Indiana at Blooming
