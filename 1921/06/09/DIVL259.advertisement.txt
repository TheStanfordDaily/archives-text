Good-bye Girls!
I This is our final ad this quarter, and in it we
want to make a sort of "farewell address'
First, let us thank you for' your kind patronage
throughout the year. It has been a pleasure for us to
serve you, and we feel that this store has in many of
you more than just customers, —REAL FRIENDS.
We hope you all pass your exes, and get as good
grades as you expect —or perhaps in some cases,
better.
j And last —enjoy your vacation. You have earned
a rest from college work, and we heartily wish you
all a very enjoyable vacation.
We shall be glad to see you again next October.
