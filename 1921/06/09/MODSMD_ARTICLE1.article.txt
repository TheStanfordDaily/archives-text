# NEW STADIUM IS NOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION
## Working Forces Are on Field and Excavation Will Be Commenced Immediately 
### 
The stadium site presents today a
totally different aspect from that which
it held when ground was first broken by
President Wilbur one week ago. Trac
tors, graders, and teams are busy at
work taking out the first layer of the
soil which must be removed before the
excavation contract is completed.
Looking across the ground where,
within 135 days from June 5, the job
will be completed, the scene resembles a
miniature plain slightly sunken below the
surrounding tableland. The scenes of
activity going on everywhere in this
plain indicate that its level will sink still
further and further below the surround
ing territory, until the 25-foot depth of
excavation has been reached.
Tractors are busy hauling behind them
the newest type of elevating grader,
which scoops the soil up as it is pulled
along, and, by means of an endless belt
running on a wide arm reaching out to
the side, pours a continual stream of dirt
into each wagon that keeps pace along
side until filled. The wagons haul the
dirt, which at present is just the surface
loam, off to the side. Later, this loam
will be utilized in building up the em
bankment and packing the playing field.
One of the things that had to be done
first, before further work could progress,
was the removal of the numerous stumps
scattered all over the site of excavation.
Over 150 of them were removed yester
day afternoon, thus clearing the field for
action. They were loosened by blasting,
and then pulled out by the tractors.
More men are being added to the
working force every day. About seventy
arc on the job at present, and eating
and sleeping quarters have been arranged
for them. Seven bunkhouses, besides
the cookhouse and office, have been
erected.
In addition to the three elevating
graders now in use, a powerful steam
shovel will be utilized as soon as it ar
rives, for cutting out the earth in places
where lack of room hampers the other
machines. The elevating graders are
pulled by 60-horscpower tractors. With
three of these tractors working, it is
estimated that 2500 cubic yards of earth
are removed every day.
