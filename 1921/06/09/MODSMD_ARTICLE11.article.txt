# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA TO PLAY IN MEMORIAL COURT AT PROMENADE
## 
### 
A combination of scenic beauty and
the harmony of master musicians is to
be offered at the Senior Promenade,
given Saturday evening, June 18, in the
Inner Quad. The San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra has been engaged to
play from eight to ten o'clock in the
square fronting the Memorial Church.
During the concert they will stroll about
the quadrangle, which has become the
mecca for art lovers. The old-fashioned
Prom, once the feature of Senior Week,
is to be revived by staging the event in
its original setting under the palms, with
the addition of the 19-piece concert or
chestra. *
Following the concert, dance music
is to be played by Whitmer's orchestra
from ten to twelve. Refreshments of
all sorts are to be served by the sorori
ties and Roble from the four flower
gardens forming the square in front of
the Memorial Church.
Stark Draper, '21, who had charge of
the illuminating of the Carnival, is to
arrange the lighting effects. By a special
arrangement of lights the beauty of the
memory to be carried away by the de
parting class will be heightened.
