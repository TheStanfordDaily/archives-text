# INDIVIDUALITY IS DISTINCT FEATURE OF 'CLARENCE' CAST
## 
### Harold B. Rorke, '24 
Booth Tarkington's "Clarence" will
be presented Wednesday, the 15th, to
one of the largest houses ever wit
nessing a Senior Farce, according to
all indications of yesterday's ticket
sale. The show will merit some sac
rifices to attend, as it will probably
be the best executed of any play given
on the campus this year. Each part
in the play, from the rather unim
portant part of the butler to that of
Clarence, is played by an actor of ex
perience and what is more important
and unusual, of individuality.
Clarence, played by Paul Claflin, has
the most possibilities of all the parts
and the fewest slighted. Claflin has
the task of playing, in the first act,
the broken down ex soldier with a
torpid liver and an apology for every
body, which part resolves, in the last
act, into depicting the household
heart-breaker and scientist. Besides
the inherent difficulty of the part, he
has had to overcome the fact that he
could not play a musical instrument
and the character has to play both
the saxaphone and the piano. Clarence
had been transferred from the band
to the mule team, where he distin
guished himself by driving without
profanity, while in the army, so Claf
lin's technique will be in accordance
with specifications.
The feature of Claflin's acting is
that he is not always trying to play
his part as so-and-so did in the orig
inal production, but he introduces a
fresh and original comedy which is
distinctly spontaneous and individual.
Those who saw the "Bubbling Bohe
hia" can't fail to remember his inter
pretation of the Englishman, which he
made from a colorless, and trite part to
one of the hits of the show.
Lucile Mitchell, playing the part of
Cora, will be difficult to distinguish
from the kid sister who's probably at
home now using brother's coin collec
tion as sinkers in her new dress be
cause she had-to-use-something. She's
not always in the way because even
sisters have to eat occasionally, but when
Cora is around, life never has a dull
moment. Miss Mitchell is a dynamo
of energy and holds the part up every
minute. Her voice is just right for the
part and so, in fact, is everything
about her. In love or war, meaning
in her relations with Bobby, her
brother, in the latter case, and any of
the countries' stock of men who hap
pen to be handy and romantic, in tlie
former, she acts both with a pep and
lire only found in soft shoe dancers
and correctly acted "small sisters."
In Bobby, who is generally known
as Jerry Powell, the audience will
find the rich man's son who is ex
pected to dominate the campus after
the institution of the Great Tax. Only
fired from three expensive schools,
his life is allowed no rest until he fills
the quota commonly conceded to rich
men's sons, and in the end he is sent
back to another one to try again. Fur
thermore he has an esthetic soul about
clothes and a sympathy for the ladies,
which in itself is not uncommon, how
ever. The uncommon part is that he
takes both seriously and does the part
so well that the audience will almost
feel ready to take them that way, too.
It is not Powell's acting which will
prevent, however, but habit, for Powell
is a worthy co-star with any of the
cast and has grasped and plays the
part perfectly.
