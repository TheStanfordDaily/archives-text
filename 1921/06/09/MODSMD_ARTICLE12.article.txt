# INDIVIDUALITY IS DISTINCT FEATURE OF 'CLARENCE' CAST
## 
### Harold B. Rorke, '24 
Booth Tarkington's "Clarence" will
be presented Wednesday, the 15th, to
one of the largest houses ever wit
nessing a Senior Farce, according to
all indications of yesterday's ticket
sale. The show will merit some sac
rifices to attend, as it will probably
be the best executed of any play given
on the campus this year. Each part
in the play, from the rather unim
portant part of the butler to that of
Clarence, is played by an actor of ex
perience and what is more important
and unusual, of individuality.
Clarence, played by Paul Claflin, has
the most possibilities of all the parts
and the fewest slighted. Claflin has
the task of playing, in the first act,
the broken down ex soldier with a
torpid liver and an apology for every
body, which part resolves, in the last
act, into depicting the household
heart-breaker and scientist. Besides
the inherent difficulty of the part, he
has had to overcome the fact that he
could not play a musical instrument
and the character has to play both
the saxaphone and the piano. Clarence
had been transferred from the band
to the mule team, where he distin
guished himself by driving without
profanity, while in the army, so Claf
lin's technique will be in accordance
with specifications.
The feature of Claflin's acting is
that he is not always trying to play
his part as so-and-so did in the orig
inal production, but he introduces a
fresh and original comedy which is
distinctly spontaneous and individual.
Those who saw the "Bubbling Bohe
hia" can't fail to remember his inter
pretation of the Englishman, which he
made from a colorless, and trite part to
one of the hits of the show.
Lucile Mitchell, playing the part of
Cora, will be difficult to distinguish
from the kid sister who's probably at
home now using brother's coin collec
tion as sinkers in her new dress be
