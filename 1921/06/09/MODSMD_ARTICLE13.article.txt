# THETA XI WINS IN INTRAMURAL RELAY FINALS YESTERDAY
## 
### 
To Theta Xi goes the intramural relay
plaque as a result of a final inter-group
race staged on the oval yesterday after
noon. The event was an eight-man, 220
affair, and the winner's time was 3:11.
The relay championship was to have
been decided several weeks ago, when a
two-heat race was run, the winner, on
a basis of time, being El Campo. Ques
tions as to the feasibility of determining
a winner on a time basis, and on the
eligibility of some of the entrants arose,
and to clear up the whole affair the com
mittee in charge of intramural track de
cided for another race, for which elig
ibility regulations would be waived.
Theta Xi, El Campo, and El Capitan
were the entrants in the event.
The winners got off with a poor start,
but their third man, Terman, gained
them second place, and in the next round
Scofield secured the lead, which they
kept throughout. Forster, who finished
for the fraternity men, was about three
yards ahead of El Campo's man, who
finished second. The line-up for the
winners was: Maillot, Wernli, Terman,
Scofield ,Smith, Reed, Clark, and For
ster.
