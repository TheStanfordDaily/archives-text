# DON'T FORGET WHAT YOU CAME FOR
## 
### 
Don't forget your fundamental purpose in coming to college. This
academic warning serves as a motto for a certain portion of Stanford
students, who take it to mean that first, and if necessary to the neglect of
everything else, students should devote their primary and supreme efforts
in the University to the following of classroom instruction. Never let
studies interfere with a college education, is another often-heard quota
tion serving as a rule for students at the other end of the scale who nev
ertheless find that they must continually submit to interference of time
required for studies in order to remain active members of the University.
It would not be possible for any student at Stanford to follow the last
proposition, even were he foolish enough seriously to want to, but there
are those among us who believe solidly in the first quotation, which, taken
as a whole, may be as absurd as the latter.
Stanford aims to produce just plain, all-round, capable, strong men,
able to take posts of leadership in the world. The student who buries
himself in a basement room of Encina and comes out three or four times
a day to attend classes, even if a marvelous scholar, is hardly preparing
himself as he should to accomplish the tasks many Stanford men have
performed. Can such a student judge his fellow workers, does he know
how they think and why they act, and is he learning anything about how
to work with them in development of worth-while enterprise? The
ability to work with fellow men is one of the greatest in the world, and a
university should teach men to acquire it. The University's best teacher
along this line is college activity, student enterprise.
in building Stanford for the future activity is more important than
many realize, because the student engaged in activity develops an interest
in his University that stays with him always. Students in activity by
devoting time in some way to the building of the University learn some
thing of its problems, and continue to think in terms of the University, and
work for it after they graduate. No stronger indication of the stanch
Stanford spirit developed and retained by men in activity is given
than by that of the number of former student leaders now actively con
nected with Stanford. At random we may pick on the Board of Trus
tees: T. T. C. Gregory, who was managing editor of the Daily: John
T. Nourse, an editor of the Daily; Herbert Hoover, a graduate mana
ger; Leland Cutler, a band leader. President Wilbur was, among other
things, a senior class president. Camptroller Roth was a student body
president, and we might go 011 naming others who are now invaluable
in Stanford's progress and whose first interest came through student ath
letics, journalism, or some form of student activity.
Students who take an active though small part in working for Stan
ford while here go on working for Stanford with an increased interest
whenever opportunity provides. Students who do nothing believe they
have already done too much and their interest in the University drops to
almost nothing when they have "what they came for," a diploma.
A wise rule for both University and student is to forget neither
studies nor activity. An education includes both.
