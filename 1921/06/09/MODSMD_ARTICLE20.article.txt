# ANOTHER YEAR
## 
### 
Today's issue of the Daily closes a volume that has recorded many
of the most important steps in Stanford's progress "over the hump."
This phrase of President Wilbur's is descriptive of steps the Univerity
itself has taken during" the last year that place it in a position enjoyed by
cess of the University administration, but also that of student activiy
few in the United States. "Over the hump" indicates not only the over
coming of several of the toughest problems in Stanford's administration,
but also thai of student activity as examplilied by the honor system and
the stadium. A detailed summary would be laborious and lengthy, and
would never express the present progress better than the three words of
the President.
The present volume of the Daily has aimed to present as accurately
as jxDssible the steps that have been made, and the news of the day. Edi
torially we have tried to judge hapennings, tendencies, and actions from
the viewpoint of Stanford as a harmonious body of students, faculty, and
alumni, a unit with one purpose, a bigger and better Stanford. With
this interest and viewjxnnt we have found much activity and many prac
tices to commend or possibly to propose; and some to criticize rather
sharply perhaps, but looking, we hope, to constructive results. We have
invited criticism for and against our own viewpoint, and have printed all
that has been received.
Three great enterprises directly concerning student life have been
made possible this year only through the co-operatoive spirit of students,
faculty, and alumni: the new Union, the basketball pavilion, and the
stadium ; and when the students return in the fall the three will stand com
pleted, a monument to the combined power of three university elements
in the building of Stanford.
If the activity and attitude of the Daily Palo At.to has been even
a small factor in the development of this power and in the promotion of
a spirit that makes for a strong, democratic university, we shall in a way
have accomplished our purpose.
The work of the Daily has at all times been a privilege any Stan
ford man would enjoy, and it is with a certain degree of reluctance,
therefore, that we turn over the keys of the office; yet it is with a greater
degree of satisfaction that we are able to make room in the chair behind
the editor's shingle for the person of Harry J. P>orba, '22, who will
assume control in the fall.
