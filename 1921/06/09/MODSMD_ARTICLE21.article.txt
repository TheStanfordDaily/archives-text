With little adoo the Stanford student accepts the lionor system which
has come after years of discussion. The success of its trial in final exami
nations next week rests purely with the individual student.
Stanford wants no half-way honor system. Either the system musl
do away with cheating', or we must abolish the system which is yet to be
tried. Much will depend on the results of the coming finals. I'radi
cally all students who take them have been on the campus at least a full
year. They know what an honor system is and why they want it, and
they know what it means to the University. If they arc unable to con

duct the examinations without the presence of cheaters this time they
can not teach new students to operate an honor system next fall. The
problem of enforcement is not with the Student Council, nor any other
student organ. It is with each separate student to determine whether or
not Stanford men of the present generation are the type of men who
tit in well with an honor system.
