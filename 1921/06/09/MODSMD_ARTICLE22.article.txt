Chancellor Emeritus David Starr Jordan sends the following to the
Daily: "Professor George Herbert Palmer of Harvard once remarked
that after talking for twenty minutes to a college man, ljet usually could
tell of what institution he was a graduate.
" 'It isn't necessary for one who knows the colleges to ask ques
tions,' he said, 'for every institution puts its indellible trade-mark on a
man's thought and character.' "
The typical Stanford man, we believe, is the one who gets things
done. He is interested in theory in that it promotes understanding; he
demands and acquires a thorough practical knowledge of his tasks; and
he has always an ideal of service. But his first mark, if we judge him
right, is that he digs in and gets something done.

SENIORS WHO HAVE SECURED tickets to the ball in order to allow
underclassmen to attend, when there are yet a number of members of
1921 who are unable to secure admission to their own function, are hardly
showing the right kind of class spirit. Many seniors this year have their
last opportunity to attend the ball and should not be ruled out because
underclassmen have the tickets. The underclassmen themselves should
have no desire to "ring in" in such a questionable fashion, and knowing
the circumstances they should return the cardboards.

EVERY STUDENT is a representative of Stanford this summer.
Learn the truth about Stanford and tell it. Stanford men do not
"sell" their University to prospective students. But they may aid in the
process of selection of the better type of all-round high-school graduates
who will measure up to the Stanford requirement of men and women.
There is a certain amount of anti-Stanford propaganda. Don't
"fall" for it, but recognize it. The truth will defeat it every time.

THE DAILY WISHES ALL PROSPERITY to the Stanford roughs
in their fight against bandoline and for democracy. While we never
will side in with those of their number who want to "run out the co-eds,"
we will take a stand at any time with those who want to run out auto
mobiles. â™¦
