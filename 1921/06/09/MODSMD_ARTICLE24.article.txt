"The Poets of the Future": A college
anthology for 1918-1920. Edited by
Henry T. Schnittkind. Boston, The
Stratford Company.
Among the books recently ordered for
the library is the last volume of a series
which should be of especial interest to
college students. "The poets of the fu
ture" are in some instances distinctly
poets of the present as well ,if we may
judge from the volume before us. There
is no reason why men and women of
college age should not write poetry of a
very high order, for the poetic faculty
usually develops early. Many of the
masterpieces of our major poets have
been written when their authors were
young .even between 18 and 22. the aver
age college age. So while much of the
verse in "The Poets of the Future," col
lected from the various college publica
tions of this country, is experimental or
stupidly imitative, the volume contains,
â– as we might justly expect, much that is
| worth serious attention.
Of the sixty-two colleges represented,
; there are only six which equal Stanford
lin the number of poems included. A
word of appreciation is due to Stan
ford's poetic "team," not only for the
number hut the quality of the poems.
Of the five poems coming from Stanford
the present reviewer has no hesitation in
according the first place to "The Lure of
the Train," by Beryl Bishop Collett. This
poem has a compelling rhythm, a graphic
imagery, and an emotional force behind
it which lift it far above the level of
i ordinary verse. We feel the power, the
j mystery, the inevitableness of the whirl
j ing advance over the shining rails, sung
! to the clanking rhythm of the wheels.
! That strange, monotonous, hurrying hum
| of rail and wheel has never been better
| translated into song.
A genuine thought and a poetic one is
;to be found in "Perspective," by A.
j Binns, but the medium of free verse is
| not well chosen for this particular idea,
j On the other hand, free verse might have
j been a better medium for "Premonition,"
by Warren Frederic Lewis, than the
somewhat clumsy alexandrines in which
it is written. An attempt to strike a
deeper poetic note in "The Suicide," by
j Gladys Green, and "Things Eternal," by
Ingegerd Uppman, fails in both in
stances to be quite convincing, though
both poems show distinct poetic feeling.
