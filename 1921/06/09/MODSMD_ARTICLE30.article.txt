# THEATER TALK
## 
### T. R. C., '22 
We Bow
"This .is the end!" cried the cook, as
she found which side of the can to open,
and we echo the same sentiment, "This
is the end." There will be no more
issues of the Daily Palo Alto this quar
ter, and in consequentia, ex officio, and
per se, there will be no more Theater
Talk. During its brief but varied exist
ence this column has provided one of
those elopement affairs which are so
popular on the campus just now, has
suffered a change of editors, and has
"rated a razz." Shrely angels could do
no more, and so, gathering up our fra
grant bouquets and, stumbling over a
tree which stands in the wings, we make
our otherwise graceful exit. We hope
you have liked it.
Responding to a curtain call, we'll say
that our last gasp concerns what is on at
the movies for the next few days. There
is much to be said in favor of relaxing
the mind by a little amusement in the
time of stress which is about to descend
upon us, and the purpose of the next
two paragraphs is to point out what re
laxation is available.
The Varsity Line-Up
Nothing could be more fat and com
forting than Fatty Arbuckle, and he is
on at the Varsity tonight and tomorrow
night in "The Traveling Salesman," said
to be his best five-reel comedy. Sunday
will see Tom Moore in "Made in Hea
ven," though his role as a fireman sug
gests other locations.
On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
of next week (the fatal days) there will
be a really big picturc, "Deception,"
which is now running at the Imperial in
the city. This spectacle presents the ro
mance of Henry VIII and Anne Baleyn,
was directed by the producer of "Pas
sion," and has received universal ac
claim wherever it has been shown.
(Whce!) The week will be rounded out
by Douglas Mac Lean in "One a Minute, 1 '
and Frank Mayo in "Colorado," which
latter is preceded by a specially colored
prologue showing the Apache Trail.
Stanford's Attractions
Bebc Daniels occupies the Stanford
screen tonight and tomorrow night in
"She Couldn't Help It." Along with
her goes the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce film which includes many ex
cellent views of Stanford University,
and which may give you a chance of
seeing yourself on the screen.
Saturday brings Mildred Harris Chap
lin' in "Old Dad," and Sunday and Mon
day wilV see William Farnum in "His
Greatest Sacrifice." With Farnum there
is a training camp reel called "A Day
With Jack Dempsey," which will be of
interest to fight fans.
Married couples and those about to
be (which seems to include a large pro
portion of our student body these days)
will be interested in "The Woman in
His House," which is on for Tuesday
and Wednesday. On Thursday and Fri
day, Wanda Hawley saves the Week by
"A Kiss in Time," the nature of which
can best be left to the imagination.
