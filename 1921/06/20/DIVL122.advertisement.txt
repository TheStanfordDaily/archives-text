t They have not been long—these past four years— 4
4 For now that they arc spent it seems, almost, ,
■+ That Father Time short-measured us a bit— *
2 And ave us shorter years than was our due. *
4 But precious joys fly fast, and years of Youth,
+ Sweetest of them all, are doubly winged. 4
Yet now that they are gone their memories J
4 Will shine like jewels in our crown of-life, J
"t» And grow more precious as the vagrant years \ 4

4 Our class was born when all the world was mad *
4 And poisoned by the churlish kiss of hate and war—
+ Was born amidst the sounds of bugle notes 4*
4 And distant muffled drums which only served J
4 To drown the anguished wail of dying men.
*£ The Quad, to which wc came, seemed blessed with peace, 4»
2 The foothills smiled upon its red-tiled roofs, J
4 Tall palms and Eucalyptus trees readied up 4
* To coach the singing birds from out the sky. 4
4, And yet there thundered down the stone Arcades T
4 The phantom echoes from the distant fronts. 4
Discordant strife surcharged the atmosphere 4»
4. And books became a levy on the soul. 1*
4 To give, to save, to serve. We heard the call, 4.
Humanity was crying to the world 4
4, And those of us who could, tossed books aside T
4 And donned the khaki or the navy blue; 4
2 And 'did our bit' (they called it that) in trench 4»
4 Or where the man lurked beneath the
+ And-those of us whom Duty bade "Remain" 4
5 Threw our hearts and souls into the tasks 4*
4 That fell our lot.
•4* And thus we learned from war 4
4 A better meaning of the word TO SERVE . T
*£ Than we had ever known before. 4
War passed. Time passed.
4 Scenes changed. And minds were turned again to books £
And to the aims we came here to achieve. 4
The magic, treasured beauty of the Quad £
4 Enchanted us again—the sunny days— 4
4 The lure of Lagunita, the spicy smell 4
* Of Eucalyptus trees, the poppy-gold— , £
4 Gripped and held us with their loveliness. 4
We studied, worked, got what we coudl from books; 4-
2 Played—and wove a close-spun fellowship.

And now the end is here. And as we stand j
4 Upon the treshold of the happy past, • 4
*£ Humanity again cries out to us 4
To give— to serve her—not in ways of war,
4 But in the ways of peace—to serve the race 4
And humankind with all of that acquired skill 4
4 Which we have mastered. * £
4 And we shall answer her. 4
* We may forget what we have learned from books, 4
4 We may forget that we are college trained, j J
4 But npver as we tread the paths of life 4
4} Will we forget our power to serve mankind. 4»
4 And some of us will carve our names 011 stars, J
4 And some will go unknown, serving, each of 11s 4
* As each sees best. But we will answer her, 4*
4 Not with idle words but living deeds. J
