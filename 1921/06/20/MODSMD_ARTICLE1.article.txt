# HISTORY OF 1921 CLASS OUTLINED BRIEFLY IN TALK
## Erickson Reports Activities of Class Throughout Four Years Spent at University 
### Paul F. Erickson 
A true history of the class of 1921
would be more than a compilation of
the events of the past four years in
which the members of this class have
played a part. It would rather be a
history of Stanford during the past
four years. But such an undertaking
would at the present moment be too
stupendous a task. However, it is en
tirely fitting that as we are about to
enter the ranks of the alumni that we
should leave some record of the part
that we have played during the past
four years.
It was in the fall of 1917, when re
ports were coming to us of the great
battle of the Aisne and the British of
fensive on the fields of Flanders, that
the members of the class of '21 caught
their first glimpse of the long arcades
of the university that was to become
their Alma Mater. No sooner was the
rush of registration over than we
gained our first introduction to the
more intensive life of the farm when
we fought with the members of the
class of '20 on the "Deke" lawn and
subsequently on the football field and
whom we eventually defeated in the
baseball fight, the last offensive of the
underclass hostilities of the year.
Of the events that occurred that fall
perhaps the most vivid are those of
the week which ended in our fisrt
Big Game. Under the leadership of
Edward Braunschweiger we aided in
building up the proper Big Game spirit
by building a bonfire which we faith
fully guarded against the Santa Clar
ans. Then came the Big Game itself
and we saw Santa Clara's better team
go down in defeat before Stanford's
greater team.
Three of our classmates helped win
that last big rugby battle —Stedman
Falk, Fred Adams, and "Cap" Camp
bell. Only a week before our Fresh
man football team, under the captaincy
of "Charlie" Doe, defeated Santa
Clara's Freshman 16 to 8. Subsequent
ly in basketball, track and baseball
we were less successful. Our Fresh
man basketball team was captained by
"Walt" Phelps, our track team led by
Kenny Wright, and our baseball team
by C. W. Teubner. It was during this
year that many 1921 athletes were de
veloped who have since played a ma
jor part in building up Stanford's ath
letic glory. In the realm of football
we have "Jack" Patrick, next year's
Varsity captain; Fred Adams, "Pret"
Holt, and the captain of this year's
Varsity, "Art" Wilcox. On the basket
ball teams of the last three years
"Bert" Mills, Fred Adams, and "Dick"
Richmond have played an essential
part in the winning of the champion
ship of the Pacific Coast Conference of
last year and the Stanford-California
series of this year. Nineteen twenty
one men who have carried Stanford's
banner in track are "Flint" Hanner,
Norman Scofield, Norman Green, "Art"
Wilcox, and Kenny Wright. In base
ball, Floyd Kallam, "Doug" Bundy,
Harvey Newlands, and Mortimer Kline
have been brilliant players. During
the brief revivial of crew three 1921
men have rowed against the California
eight—"Al" Cary, Fred Adams, and
Lyman Wilbur.
Near the close of our Freshman year
came a call from Italy for ambulance
units. Hundreds of Stanford men of
fered to serve in Italy and of the eight
finally chosen from Stanford two were
members of the class of 1921, namely
11. H. Darling and Howard Gould.
When perhaps the majority of us
came back for our Sophomore year
we found that the University had been
turned into a veritable military and
naval training camp. In the months
that followed practically all '21 men
who had returned were to be seen in
khaki or navy blue. With the signing
