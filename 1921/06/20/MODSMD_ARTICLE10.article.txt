# NEW RESPONSIBILITY MUST BE ASSUMED BY 1921 SAYS PATRICK
## 
### 
"The days we have looked forward to
are at hand," said President J. F. Pat
rick to the Senior Class beginning Class
Day exercises, "but as we realize just
what they mean there is not that same
feeling of triumph and finality that wo
anticipated. We begin to realize that
instead of having finished something, we
have simply come to a new turn in the
highway and that the real road lies
ahead and beyond. It is not to be mark
ed off by classes or years or commence
ment exercises, it ends for us as for
other men and women at the last great
resting-place.
As the Stanford of today expects and
demands much more from us than it did
from the earlier classes ,so the world
and its people will demand more of tis.
We have a college education—the world
will ask that we deliver a college man's
obligations to its progress. As under
graduates we owed certain duties to
Stanford; as alumni we shall owe much
more. Let us accept all these responsi
bilities gratefully and joyfully, and final
ly, before we go away, let us seek out
those professors and University officials
who have helped and inspired us; let us
go to them individually and in a man
to-man fashion tell them that we appre
ciate our years of association with
them."'
