# 1921 JOINS ALUMNI

### 
The conferring of degrees to the graduates this morning is Signifi
cant not because it severs the association of the Class of 1921 to Stan
ford, but because it advances the graduates to a newer and more com
plete relationship with the University. 1 lie Stanford conception of uni
versity life rejects the idea that the four years spent on the harm
form a separate chapter in the life of a student, closed when the degree
has been awarded. Many of those who today received diplomas will
remain at Stanford for advanced work, and during their post-graduate
courses will give freely in services to their alma mater. The greater
number, beginning active work in their chosen professions, will under
take that work as Stanford men and women. Ihe numerous alumni
clubs scattered throughout the country, the recent alumni reunion, and
the response of graduates to the stadium drive should silence the few
who may doubt the continued interest of Stanford alumni in their alma
mater. The Class of 1921 today joins that band of loyal graduates upon
whom rest in a large degree the future of Stanford.
