# THE 						SENIOR BALL
## 
### 
The Senior Ball at the President's Home was undoubtedly the most
successful party the campus has enjoyed this year. The courtesy of Dr.
and Mrs. Wilbur in permitting the use of their home and in aiding in
i-very way in promoting the ball is thoroughly appreciated by the class.
There has been much foolishness in connection with the ball in the
past, the Class of 1920 refusing to sponser a ball. The Class of 1921 and
its ball committee are to be commended for the manner in which the
dance this spring was conducted. The unqualified success of the 1 ( >21
ball means that there can be no further question as to the proper place
for Senior Balls in the future.
