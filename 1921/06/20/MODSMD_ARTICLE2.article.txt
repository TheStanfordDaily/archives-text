# "INITIATIVE" IS THE PRESIDENT'S TOPIC AT COMMENCEMENT
## "Individuality Must Be Considered In the Light of the Rights of Others and Society" Wilbur says 
### 
Today this University sets free half
a thousand trained minds to go out
into the complicated society organized
through countless generations by hu
man beings who have well nigh con
quered the earth through physical
skill, courage, cooperative effort, and
intellect. These Stanford minds will
soon merge into the great mass of hu
man power, and we wonder when we
see you start fresh from our walls
whether you will soon be submerged
and lost or whether your qualities are
such that, as time goes by, you will
stand out here and there above the
general crowd. Mankind proceeds for
ward as a mighty stream of water
goes along over uneven ground. Some
particles of water must lead at every
point. Some rivulets get into blind
pockets and some dry up while others,
pursuing the path favored by the laws

of physics, cut through obstructions
and bear a mighty current. Each drop
of water in the lead must run the risks
of leadership. Pushed by mighty
forces there is no escape. Mankind,
though, can control its course and the
rate of its progress and in our advance
the units possess the power of optional
leadership. You as a thinking person,
an educated trained unit, must soon
decide by your daily choices whether
you are to lead or to follow, whether
you are to run the risks of the advance
guard or to float along in the rear.
Your own initiative must decide
whether you are to be a "self-starter"
or whether some one must turn the
crank that sets you in motion. Are you
to learn to give orders or are you to
take them?
The world needs self-starters ask
ing "why?" and showing "how." Man
is a social animal, slowly and pain
fully building up a social structure in
which all must have a helpful part.
But if we look at history we find that
the acts of single individuals have
time after time molded the progress
of all. A Julius Ceasar, a Napoleon, a
Lincoln or an Edison changes the
course of history for whole peoples.
The contributions of individuals have
been so great that many have been
alarmed when some of our social insti
tutions have shown signs of taking
the dead level of common mediocrity.
In fact, we see on all sides struggles
between the individuals and the mass.
Each day our law-makers compromise
between the rights of the individual
and the rights of the public. Our most
sacred possession in America is the
retention of the power of the initiative
of the individual â€”and yet we feel that
the majority must rule. Each meas
ure for the good of the social organism
may be at the cost of some individual
or group. How can we avoid the dan
ger of turning out a pattern citizen
the way we turn out industrial pat
terns, if we encroach too far upon the
individual? The whole subject is a
blend of rights, duties, selfishness,
common good, altruism, morals and re
ligion.
The Anglo-Saxon has considered
each mentally sound person as inde
pendent and capable of making up his
own mind. We have tolerated that
most unsocial being, the conscientious
objector, even in the midst of the
greatest common danger. Our respect
has often gone out to the man who
was true to himself, as he conceived
himself, even though it made him a
burden upon society. Every public
health measure for the common wel
fare has to fight its way against in
dividual desires and so-called rights.
Were it possible for each to take the
full effects of his own acts the rest
of us would be unconcerned. But our
lives are so interlocked that no one
can live unto himself. All individual
rights must be viewed in the light of
the rights of others and of duty to
otners. There is a harsh, selfish, al
most savage strain in all of us. In
some it never seems to flicker into
