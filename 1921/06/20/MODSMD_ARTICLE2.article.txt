# "INITIATIVE" IS THE PRESIDENT'S TOPIC AT COMMENCEMENT
## "Individuality Must Be Considered In the Light of the Rights of Others and Society" Wilbur says 
### 
Today this University sets free half
a thousand trained minds to go out
into the complicated society organized
through countless generations by hu
man beings who have well nigh con
quered the earth through physical
skill, courage, cooperative effort, and
intellect. These Stanford minds will
soon merge into the great mass of hu
man power, and we wonder when we
see you start fresh from our walls
whether you will soon be submerged
and lost or whether your qualities are
such that, as time goes by, you will
stand out here and there above the
general crowd. Mankind proceeds for
ward as a mighty stream of water
goes along over uneven ground. Some
particles of water must lead at every
point. Some rivulets get into blind
pockets and some dry up while others,
pursuing the path favored by the laws

of physics, cut through obstructions
and bear a mighty current. Each drop
of water in the lead must run the risks
of leadership. Pushed by mighty
forces there is no escape. Mankind,
though, can control its course and the
rate of its progress and in our advance
the units possess the power of optional
leadership. You as a thinking person,
an educated trained unit, must soon
decide by your daily choices whether
you are to lead or to follow, whether
you are to run the risks of the advance
guard or to float along in the rear.
Your own initiative must decide
whether you are to be a "self-starter"
or whether some one must turn the
crank that sets you in motion. Are you
to learn to give orders or are you to
take them?
The world needs self-starters ask
ing "why?" and showing "how." Man
is a social animal, slowly and pain
fully building up a social structure in
which all must have a helpful part.
But if we look at history we find that
the acts of single individuals have
time after time molded the progress
of all. A Julius Ceasar, a Napoleon, a
Lincoln or an Edison changes the
course of history for whole peoples.
The contributions of individuals have
been so great that many have been
alarmed when some of our social insti
tutions have shown signs of taking
the dead level of common mediocrity.
In fact, we see on all sides struggles
between the individuals and the mass.
Each day our law-makers compromise
between the rights of the individual
and the rights of the public. Our most
sacred possession in America is the
retention of the power of the initiative
of the individual —and yet we feel that
the majority must rule. Each meas
ure for the good of the social organism
may be at the cost of some individual
or group. How can we avoid the dan
ger of turning out a pattern citizen
the way we turn out industrial pat
terns, if we encroach too far upon the
individual? The whole subject is a
blend of rights, duties, selfishness,
common good, altruism, morals and re
ligion.
The Anglo-Saxon has considered
each mentally sound person as inde
pendent and capable of making up his
own mind. We have tolerated that
most unsocial being, the conscientious
objector, even in the midst of the
greatest common danger. Our respect
has often gone out to the man who
was true to himself, as he conceived
himself, even though it made him a
burden upon society. Every public
health measure for the common wel
fare has to fight its way against in
dividual desires and so-called rights.
Were it possible for each to take the
full effects of his own acts the rest
of us would be unconcerned. But our
lives are so interlocked that no one
can live unto himself. All individual
rights must be viewed in the light of
the rights of others and of duty to
otners. There is a harsh, selfish, al
most savage strain in all of us. In
some it never seems to flicker into
sight, their lives having fallen in soft
places. But anyone who sees men or
women under strain aud fatigue, or
straggling for life, realizes the com
manding strength of the elemental hu
man qualities. It requires some exhi
bition of selfishness to take care of
oneself and one's family. The man or
woman who finds out when to be gen
erous, when to add his strength to
that of the team, does the most for
the future. It is natural with the in
herited drive that most of us Ameri
cans have implanted in us, that in
dividualism should at times be carried
to the extreme in our thoughts and
deeds. The early history of any West
ern town gave full play to that acme
of individualism, the self-reliant, self
sustained American pioneer. It took
emergencies to get team play out of
such wonderful men. But Americans
are not alone in this trait. Michelet
told Matthew Arnold, in speaking of
that country where Liberty, Equality
and Fraternity are the watch-words,
"France is a nation of barbarians civi
lized by the conscription." When wy
think of rights and freedom we are at
once reminded of the story of the man
who said, "I have the right to shake
my fist in the face of anyone," and of
the man who answered, "Your right
to shake your fist In my face ends
where my nose begins," and of the
man whose graphic career of individ
ualism was portrayed in this epitaph:
Here lies of body of Jonathan Hay
Who died, maintaining his Right of
Way.
He was right, dead right, as he sped
along;
But he's just as dead as if he'd been
wrong.
We have all seen the man who goes
ahead as he likes and the bills that
others pay for his gross selfishness.
We know the man who climbs up on
the bodies of those crushed by him.
We know those who ride through life
011 the fortunes accumulated by others
from others. We at times see the sel
fish apparently successful individuals
of whom Seneca said, "Money tumbles
into the hands of certain men as a
shilling tumbles down a sewer."
We know the man who thinks he
knows just what he is entitled to and
demands it down to the last pound,
even though that pound be flesh.
Where, then, are we to draw the line
between the individual and society?
How are we to maintain the neces
sary leadership without suffering too
much from the abuses of individuals?
Where are the lines of compromise
and conformity to be? How can you
serve the mass without losing yourself
completely in it? The great thing is
not to confuse your rights with your
duties. Your duties are to your neigh
bors as well as to yourself. You can
be an individualist, you can retain the
blessing of initiative and without det
riment to others but to their profit, if
your goal is their good and your acts
are wise. You must stand ready to
bow to the will of the majority to se
cure order and harmony by so doing
you must sacrifice something funda
mental to your integrity as a human
being. You can lead in forming the
majority opinion that will control for
all. You can make your brain work
to solve new problems in any field of
knowledge into which you are willing
to plough deeply. You can be a self
starter for the no-man's land of hu
man knowledge where new facts are
to be found if you can find a way
through the barbed wire, the pools and
the zones of fire. You can serve in
110 new way if you are content to fol
low with the others up and down the
protected trenches.

between the rights of the individual
and the rights of the public. Our most
sacred possession in America is the
retention of the power of the initiative
of the individual —and yet we feel that
the majority must rule. Each meas
ure for the good of the social organism
may be at the cost of some individual
or group. How can we avoid the dan
ger of turning out a pattern citizen
the way we turn out industrial pat
terns, if we encroach too far upon the
individual? The whole subject is a
blend of rights, duties, selfishness,
common good, altruism, morals and re
ligion.
The Anglo-Saxon has considered
each mentally sound person as inde
pendent and capable of making up his
own mind. We have tolerated that
most unsocial being, the conscientious
objector, even in the midst of the
greatest common danger. Our respect
has often gone out to the man who
was true to himself, as he conceived
himself, even though it made him a
burden upon society. Every public
health measure for the common wel
fare has to fight its way against in
dividual desires and so-called rights.
Were it possible for each to take the
full effects of his own acts the rest
of us would be unconcerned. But our
lives are so interlocked that no one
can live unto himself. All individual
rights must be viewed in the light of
the rights of others and of duty to
otners. There is a harsh, selfish, al
most savage strain in all of us. In
some it never seems to flicker into
sight, their lives having fallen in soft
places. But anyone who sees men or
women under strain aud fatigue, or
straggling for life, realizes the com
manding strength of the elemental hu
man qualities. It requires some exhi
bition of selfishness to take care of
oneself and one's family. The man or
woman who finds out when to be gen
erous, when to add his strength to
that of the team, does the most for
the future. It is natural with the in
herited drive that most of us Ameri
cans have implanted in us, that in
dividualism should at times be carried
to the extreme in our thoughts and
deeds. The early history of any West
ern town gave full play to that acme
of individualism, the self-reliant, self
sustained American pioneer. It took
emergencies to get team play out of
such wonderful men. But Americans
are not alone in this trait. Michelet
told Matthew Arnold, in speaking of
that country where Liberty, Equality
and Fraternity are the watch-words,
"France is a nation of barbarians civi
lized by the conscription." When wy
think of rights and freedom we are at
once reminded of the story of the man
who said, "I have the right to shake
my fist in the face of anyone," and of
the man who answered, "Your right
to shake your fist In my face ends
where my nose begins," and of the
man whose graphic career of individ
ualism was portrayed in this epitaph:
Here lies of body of Jonathan Hay
Who died, maintaining his Right of
Way.
He was right, dead right, as he sped
along;
But he's just as dead as if he'd been
wrong.
We have all seen the man who goes
ahead as he likes and the bills that
others pay for his gross selfishness.
We know the man who climbs up on
the bodies of those crushed by him.
We know those who ride through life
011 the fortunes accumulated by others
from others. We at times see the sel
fish apparently successful individuals
of whom Seneca said, "Money tumbles
into the hands of certain men as a
shilling tumbles down a sewer."
We know the man who thinks he
knows just what he is entitled to and
demands it down to the last pound,
even though that pound be flesh.
Where, then, are we to draw the line
between the individual and society?
How are we to maintain the neces
sary leadership without suffering too
much from the abuses of individuals?
Where are the lines of compromise
and conformity to be? How can you
serve the mass without losing yourself
completely in it? The great thing is
not to confuse your rights with your
duties. Your duties are to your neigh
bors as well as to yourself. You can
be an individualist, you can retain the
blessing of initiative and without det
riment to others but to their profit, if
your goal is their good and your acts
are wise. You must stand ready to
bow to the will of the majority to se
cure order and harmony by so doing
you must sacrifice something funda
mental to your integrity as a human
being. You can lead in forming the
majority opinion that will control for
all. You can make your brain work
to solve new problems in any field of
knowledge into which you are willing
to plough deeply. You can be a self
starter for the no-man's land of hu
man knowledge where new facts are
to be found if you can find a way
through the barbed wire, the pools and
the zones of fire. You can serve in
110 new way if you are content to fol
low with the others up and down the
protected trenches.

Today this University sets free half
a thousand trained minds to go out
into the complicated society organized
through countless generations by hu
man beings who have well nigh con
quered the earth through physical
skill, courage, cooperative effort, and
intellect. These Stanford minds will
soon merge into the great mass of hu
man power, and we wonder when we
see you start fresh from our walls
whether you will soon be submerged
and lost or whether your qualities are
such that, as time goes by, you will
stand out here and there above the
general crowd. Mankind proceeds for
ward as a mighty stream of water
goes along over uneven ground. Some
particles of water must lead at every
point. Some rivulets get into blind
pockets and some dry up while others,
pursuing the path favored by the laws

of physics, cut through obstructions
and bear a mighty current. Each drop
of water in the lead must run the risks
of leadership. Pushed by mighty
forces there is no escape. Mankind,
though, can control its course and the
rate of its progress and in our advance
the units possess the power of optional
leadership. You as a thinking person,
an educated trained unit, must soon
decide by your daily choices whether
you are to lead or to follow, whether
you are to run the risks of the advance
guard or to float along in the rear.
Your own initiative must decide
whether you are to be a "self-starter"
or whether some one must turn the
crank that sets you in motion. Are you
to learn to give orders or are you to
take them?
The world needs self-starters ask
ing "why?" and showing "how." Man
is a social animal, slowly and pain
fully building up a social structure in
which all must have a helpful part.
But if we look at history we find that
the acts of single individuals have
time after time molded the progress
of all. A Julius Ceasar, a Napoleon, a
Lincoln or an Edison changes the
course of history for whole peoples.
The contributions of individuals have
been so great that many have been
alarmed when some of our social insti
tutions have shown signs of taking
the dead level of common mediocrity.
In fact, we see on all sides struggles
between the individuals and the mass.

such wonderful men. But Americans
are not alone in this trait. Michelet
told Matthew Arnold, in speaking of
that country where Liberty, Equality
and Fraternity are the watch-words,
"France is a nation of barbarians civi
lized by the conscription." When wy
think of rights and freedom we are at
once reminded of the story of the man
who said, "I have the right to shake
my fist in the face of anyone," and of
the man who answered, "Your right
to shake your fist In my face ends
where my nose begins," and of the
man whose graphic career of individ
ualism was portrayed in this epitaph:
Here lies of body of Jonathan Hay
Who died, maintaining his Right of
Way.
He was right, dead right, as he sped
along;
But he's just as dead as if he'd been
wrong.
We have all seen the man who goes
ahead as he likes and the bills that
others pay for his gross selfishness.
We know the man who climbs up on
the bodies of those crushed by him.
We know those who ride through life
011 the fortunes accumulated by others
from others. We at times see the sel
fish apparently successful individuals
of whom Seneca said, "Money tumbles
into the hands of certain men as a
shilling tumbles down a sewer."
We know the man who thinks he
knows just what he is entitled to and
demands it down to the last pound,
even though that pound be flesh.
Where, then, are we to draw the line
between the individual and society?
How are we to maintain the neces
sary leadership without suffering too
much from the abuses of individuals?
Where are the lines of compromise
and conformity to be? How can you
serve the mass without losing yourself
completely in it? The great thing is
not to confuse your rights with your
duties. Your duties are to your neigh
bors as well as to yourself. You can
be an individualist, you can retain the
blessing of initiative and without det
riment to others but to their profit, if
your goal is their good and your acts
are wise. You must stand ready to
bow to the will of the majority to se
cure order and harmony by so doing
you must sacrifice something funda
mental to your integrity as a human
being. You can lead in forming the
majority opinion that will control for
all. You can make your brain work
to solve new problems in any field of
knowledge into which you are willing
to plough deeply. You can be a self
starter for the no-man's land of hu
man knowledge where new facts are
to be found if you can find a way
through the barbed wire, the pools and
the zones of fire. You can serve in
110 new way if you are content to fol
low with the others up and down the
protected trenches.
(The president's address is given only

Today this University sets free half
a thousand trained minds to go out
into the complicated society organized
through countless generations by hu
man beings who have well nigh con
quered the earth through physical
skill, courage, cooperative effort, and
intellect. These Stanford minds will
soon merge into the great mass of hu
man power, and we wonder when we
see you start fresh from our walls
whether you will soon be submerged
and lost or whether your qualities are
such that, as time goes by, you will
stand out here and there above the
general crowd. Mankind proceeds for
ward as a mighty stream of water
goes along over uneven ground. Some
particles of water must lead at every
point. Some rivulets get into blind
pockets and some dry up while others,
pursuing the path favored by the laws

of physics, cut through obstructions
and bear a mighty current. Each drop
of water in the lead must run the risks
of leadership. Pushed by mighty
forces there is no escape. Mankind,
though, can control its course and the
rate of its progress and in our advance
the units possess the power of optional
leadership. You as a thinking person,
an educated trained unit, must soon
decide by your daily choices whether
you are to lead or to follow, whether
you are to run the risks of the advance
guard or to float along in the rear.
Your own initiative must decide
whether you are to be a "self-starter"
or whether some one must turn the
crank that sets you in motion. Are you
to learn to give orders or are you to
take them?
The world needs self-starters ask
ing "why?" and showing "how." Man
is a social animal, slowly and pain
fully building up a social structure in
which all must have a helpful part.
But if we look at history we find that
the acts of single individuals have
time after time molded the progress
of all. A Julius Ceasar, a Napoleon, a
Lincoln or an Edison changes the
course of history for whole peoples.
The contributions of individuals have
been so great that many have been
alarmed when some of our social insti
tutions have shown signs of taking
the dead level of common mediocrity.
In fact, we see on all sides struggles
between the individuals and the mass.
Each day our law-makers compromise
between the rights of the individual
and the rights of the public. Our most
sacred possession in America is the
retention of the power of the initiative
of the individual —and yet we feel that
the majority must rule. Each meas
ure for the good of the social organism
may be at the cost of some individual
or group. How can we avoid the dan
ger of turning out a pattern citizen
the way we turn out industrial pat
terns, if we encroach too far upon the
individual? The whole subject is a
blend of rights, duties, selfishness,
common good, altruism, morals and re
ligion.
The Anglo-Saxon has considered
each mentally sound person as inde
pendent and capable of making up his
own mind. We have tolerated that
most unsocial being, the conscientious
objector, even in the midst of the
greatest common danger. Our respect
has often gone out to the man who
was true to himself, as he conceived
himself, even though it made him a
burden upon society. Every public
health measure for the common wel
fare has to fight its way against in
dividual desires and so-called rights.
Were it possible for each to take the
full effects of his own acts the rest
of us would be unconcerned. But our
lives are so interlocked that no one
can live unto himself. All individual
rights must be viewed in the light of
the rights of others and of duty to
otners. There is a harsh, selfish, al
most savage strain in all of us. In
some it never seems to flicker into
sight, their lives having fallen in soft
places. But anyone who sees men or
women under strain aud fatigue, or
straggling for life, realizes the com
manding strength of the elemental hu
man qualities. It requires some exhi
bition of selfishness to take care of
oneself and one's family. The man or
woman who finds out when to be gen
erous, when to add his strength to
that of the team, does the most for
the future. It is natural with the in
herited drive that most of us Ameri
cans have implanted in us, that in
dividualism should at times be carried
to the extreme in our thoughts and
deeds. The early history of any West
ern town gave full play to that acme
of individualism, the self-reliant, self
sustained American pioneer. It took
emergencies to get team play out of
such wonderful men. But Americans
are not alone in this trait. Michelet

to solve new problems in any field of
knowledge into which you are willing
to plough deeply. You can be a self
starter for the no-man's land of hu
man knowledge where new facts are
to be found if you can find a way
through the barbed wire, the pools and
the zones of fire. You can serve in
110 new way if you are content to fol
low with the others up and down the
protected trenches.
