# MORTIMER KLINE DELIVERS ORATION
## Kline Says That Upon Alumni and Its Accomplishments Depends Our Reputation 
### 
As this week brings to an end our
four happy years at Stanford, it is
fitting indeed, that in these last hours
we address outselves to an observ
ance of Stanford's honored tradition;
that we make a pilgrimage to the
tomb of the founders of this institu
tion; that we dedicate a plate, as a
pledge of our loyalty to Stanford, and
have the honor of placing it beoide
those illustrious classes which have
gone before us, and that we hear the
history of the achievements of our
class as an under-graduate body. It
is appropriate that we perform these
last duties as undergraduates, for in
a very few hours we shall be admitted
into the fellowship and privilege of
a Stanford alumnus, and new responsi
bilities and greater ones will attach
themselves to us.
As we pass to leave, we must realize
that there are hundreds of young men
and young women, who are clamoring
for entrance into Stanford, who are
seeking the right to avail themselves
of the privilege and opportunity which
wo have enjoyed during our life here.
They have chosen Stanford as the
place for their preparation for life.
They have chosen it as we did, in
preference to any other University.
Why have they chosen it? Because of
Stanford's splendid reputation; as a
university of character and service!
What is it then that makes a uni
versity great?
Is it its age, or size, or its wealth?
No. Is it the buildings? No, for few
people ever see them. Is it an unique
and efficient personality in office of
President? Powerful a factor as he
may be in the academic world, he
alone cannot make a great university.
Is it the faculty? In a certain sense,
yes. In the world of science, the
contribution of mankind by researches
of its faculty men, to a large measure
is the guage of the caliber of the uni
versity. But a faculty alone does not
maintain the reputation of a univer (
sity.
A university is always judged by
its output, by the type and char
acter of its men and women gradu
ates. It is for this reason that Stan
ford has achieved its world-wide
reputation.
In ..ue period of beginning,
Starr Jordan and his small group of
assistants, came West and formed the
cornerstone of this institution. Their
personalities attracts! here the sturdy
pioneers who were to become Stan
ford's first graduates. Soon they left
and entered on the walks of life. The
test, whether Stanford would continue
to grow, and become a great institu
tion rested in their hands. Their an
swer by their deeds was conclusive.
Soon their weight became felt, and
the reputations which they established
added luster fo the name of Stanford
and furnished incentive to others to
seek life here. Stanford's host op
portunity for service came during the
war. We matriculated into the Uni
versity at that time and found the
entire energy and spirit of Stanford
consecrated to service to our govern
ment. The ranks of our professors
were thinned, and more than two thou
sand students served the colors. It
was during this period that the service
rendered by Stanford men, greatly
enhanced the reputation of Stanford.
Herbert Hoover emerged and set up
for the world his splendid idealism of
constructive service. To the world
lie is a Stanford graduate; an em
bodiment of the spirit of service and
character which exists here. Similar
services were rendered by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Irwin, and countless
others, who as Stanford graduates,
by their deeds, have placed Stanford
before the public.
Few of us may have ability or op
portunity for such service—but our
part is none the less important. Upon
each one of us rests the future repu
tation of Stanford. Graduation places
us on a grave responsibility, which
is of great importance to Stanford's
welfare, a duty which cannot be
shifted. I

university of character and service!
What is it then that makes a uni
versity great?
Is it its age, or size, or its wealth?
No. Is it the buildings? No, for few
people ever see them. Is it an unique
and efficient personality in office of
President? Powerful a factor as he
may be in the academic world, he
alone cannot make a great university.
Is it the faculty? In a certain sense,
yes. In the world of science, the
contribution of mankind by researches
of its faculty men, to a large measure
is the guage of the caliber of the uni
versity. But a faculty alone does not
maintain the reputation of a univer (
sity.
A university is always judged by
its output, by the type and char
acter of its men and women gradu
ates. It is for this reason that Stan
ford has achieved its world-wide
reputation.
In ..ue period of beginning,
Starr Jordan and his small group of
assistants, came West and formed the
cornerstone of this institution. Their
personalities attracts! here the sturdy
pioneers who were to become Stan
ford's first graduates. Soon they left
and entered on the walks of life. The
test, whether Stanford would continue
to grow, and become a great institu
tion rested in their hands. Their an
swer by their deeds was conclusive.
Soon their weight became felt, and
the reputations which they established
added luster fo the name of Stanford
and furnished incentive to others to
seek life here. Stanford's host op
portunity for service came during the
war. We matriculated into the Uni
versity at that time and found the
entire energy and spirit of Stanford
consecrated to service to our govern
ment. The ranks of our professors
were thinned, and more than two thou
sand students served the colors. It
was during this period that the service
rendered by Stanford men, greatly
enhanced the reputation of Stanford.
Herbert Hoover emerged and set up
for the world his splendid idealism of
constructive service. To the world
lie is a Stanford graduate; an em
bodiment of the spirit of service and
character which exists here. Similar
services were rendered by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Irwin, and countless
others, who as Stanford graduates,
by their deeds, have placed Stanford
before the public.
Few of us may have ability or op
portunity for such service—but our
part is none the less important. Upon
each one of us rests the future repu
tation of Stanford. Graduation places
us on a grave responsibility, which
is of great importance to Stanford's
welfare, a duty which cannot be
shifted. I
As this week brings to an end our
four happy years at Stanford, it is
fitting indeed, that in these last hours
we address outselves to an observ
ance of Stanford's honored tradition;
that we make a pilgrimage to the
tomb of the founders of this institu
tion; that we dedicate a plate, as a
pledge of our loyalty to Stanford, and
have the honor of placing it beoide
those illustrious classes which have
gone before us, and that we hear the
history of the achievements of our
class as an under-graduate body. It
is appropriate that we perform these
last duties as undergraduates, for in
a very few hours we shall be admitted
into the fellowship and privilege of
a Stanford alumnus, and new responsi
bilities and greater ones will attach
themselves to us.
As we pass to leave, we must realize
that there are hundreds of young men
and young women, who are clamoring
for entrance into Stanford, who are
seeking the right to avail themselves
of the privilege and opportunity which
wo have enjoyed during our life here.
They have chosen Stanford as the
place for their preparation for life.
They have chosen it as we did, in
preference to any other University.
Why have they chosen it? Because of
Stanford's splendid reputation; as a
university of character and service!
