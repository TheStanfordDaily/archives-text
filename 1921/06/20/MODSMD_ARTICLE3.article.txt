# MORTIMER KLINE DELIVERS ORATION
## Kline Says That Upon Alumni and Its Accomplishments Depends Our Reputation 
### 
As this week brings to an end our
four happy years at Stanford, it is
fitting indeed, that in these last hours
we address outselves to an observ
ance of Stanford's honored tradition;
that we make a pilgrimage to the
tomb of the founders of this institu
tion; that we dedicate a plate, as a
pledge of our loyalty to Stanford, and
have the honor of placing it beoide
those illustrious classes which have
gone before us, and that we hear the
history of the achievements of our
class as an under-graduate body. It
is appropriate that we perform these
last duties as undergraduates, for in
a very few hours we shall be admitted
into the fellowship and privilege of
a Stanford alumnus, and new responsi

themselves to us.
As we pass to leave, we must realize
that there are hundreds of young men
and young women, who are clamoring
for entrance into Stanford, who are
seeking the right to avail themselves
of the privilege and opportunity which
wo have enjoyed during our life here.
They have chosen Stanford as the
place for their preparation for life.
They have chosen it as we did, in
preference to any other University.
Why have they chosen it? Because of
Stanford's splendid reputation; as a
university of character and service!
What is it then that makes a uni

Is it its age, or size, or its wealth?
No. Is it the buildings? No, for few
people ever see them. Is it an unique
and efficient personality in office of
President? Powerful a factor as he
may be in the academic world, he
alone cannot make a great university.
Is it the faculty? In a certain sense,
yes. In the world of science, the
contribution of mankind by researches
of its faculty men, to a large measure
is the guage of the caliber of the uni
versity. But a faculty alone does not
maintain the reputation of a univer (
sity.
A university is always judged by
its output, by the type and char
acter of its men and women gradu
ates. It is for this reason that Stan
ford has achieved its world-wide
reputation.
