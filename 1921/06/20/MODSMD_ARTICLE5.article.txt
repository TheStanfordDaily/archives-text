# EDUCATION BOARD GIVES LARGE SUM FOR SALARY FOND
## $300,000 Given to Make Salary Increase of Professors Go In Effect at Once 
### 
The surprise of the Stanford Com
mencement exercises this year was
President Wilbur's announcement of
the offer of the General Education
Board to contribute $300,000 towards
a million dollar endowment for the
increase of professors' salaries with
the added provision for beginning at
once the payment of $25,000 annually
for two years, while the total sum is
being gathered. This will make it
possible for the salary increases to be
put into effect at once while the en
dowment is being raised.
This announcement by President
Wilbur came at the end of a list of
gifts to the University since last Com
mencement, which aggregates a total
far exceeding that of any other year
since the original endowment was con
ferred. This year's gifts include the
notable $700,000 endowment by Car
negie Corporation for the Stanford
Food Research Institute, the $50,000
by the will of the late Edmund C.
Converse for scholarships, Stanford
being the only far western college so
aided in a group of ten in the United
States, a fund of $11,000 contributed
by the class of '96, and a fund of $32,-
750 pledged by this year's graduating
class through a life insurance plan,
as well as the contributions of stu
dents, alumni and friends to the $210,-
000 football stadium, and of students
to the $95,000 basketball pavilion.
President Wilbur declared that the
selection of Stanford for the General
Education Board Endowment was an
indication of confidence in the Uni
versity's aims and methods on the
part of a body well informed on uni
versity conditions throughout the
country, and added that this same
confidence on the part of the public
assures the raising of the $700,000.
He said:
"The very wide range of interest
manifested by the list of gifts for the
academic year 1920-21 encourages us
to feel that the general public will
make it readily possible for us to raise
at least $700,000 in the next two years I
tto complete the $1,000,000 endowment
made possible by the General Educa
tion Board. Stanford has entered upon
a new era. It is recognized as a Uni
versity of national scope and service.
It is significant that one of the largest
and most active Stanford Alumni As
sociations is located in New York City.
"The fact that the General Educa
tion Board with its unusually accurate
and complete knowledge of the univer
sities of the country has, after a care

class through a life insurance plan,
as well as the contributions of stu

President Wilbur declared that the
selection of Stanford for the General
Education Board Endowment was an
indication of confidence in the Uni
versity's aims and methods on the
part of a body well informed on uni
versity conditions throughout the
country, and added that this same
confidence on the part of the public
assures the raising of the $700,000.
He said:
"The very wide range of interest
manifested by the list of gifts for the
academic year 1920-21 encourages us
to feel that the general public will
make it readily possible for us to raise
at least $700,000 in the next two years I
tto complete the $1,000,000 endowment
made possible by the General Educa

a new era. It is recognized as a Uni
versity of national scope and service.
It is significant that one of the largest
and most active Stanford Alumni As
sociations is located in New York City.
"The fact that the General Educa

The surprise of the Stanford Com
mencement exercises this year was
President Wilbur's announcement of
the offer of the General Education
Board to contribute $300,000 towards
a million dollar endowment for the
increase of professors' salaries with
the added provision for beginning at
once the payment of $25,000 annually
for two years, while the total sum is
being gathered. This will make it
possible for the salary increases to be
put into effect at once while the en
dowment is being raised.
This announcement by President
Wilbur came at the end of a list of
gifts to the University since last Com
mencement, which aggregates a total
far exceeding that of any other year
since the original endowment was con
ferred. This year's gifts include the
notable $700,000 endowment by Car
negie Corporation for the Stanford
Food Research Institute, the $50,000
by the will of the late Edmund C.
Converse for scholarships, Stanford
being the only far western college so
aided in a group of ten in the United
States, a fund of $11,000 contributed
by the class of '96, and a fund of $32,-
750 pledged by this year's graduating
