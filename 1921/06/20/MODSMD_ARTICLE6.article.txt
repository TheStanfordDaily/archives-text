the task that has been given to us, we

strife upon which you enter; knowing
your native strength, knowing, too, the
mighty opportunities which have been
yours, we shall call you unto conflict,
confident that we can trust you to battle
manfully, even unto the end. Know

effort, wc shall spur you on by the vi

which must be yours.
