# ARCHBISHOP HANNA DELIVERS SERMON
## Baccalaureate Emphasizes the Necessity For All to Fight For the Cause of Religion 
### 
"The world into which you go needs
correction, and the opportunity to do
good is unlimited," Archbishop Hanna
said to the graduates of 1921 yester
day. He stated in part:
"From Alma Mater's quiet shades you
go forth today into a world shaken,
convulsed as never before in the mem
ory of men. From Wisdom's peaceful
quest, you g oto take your place in the
battle ranks with your brother men, to
fight for truth, for justice, for helpful
love; to fight for the noble inheritance
that has come to us across the years.
From subjection to the kindly rule of
men truly great, you become today, veri
ly masters of your own destiny, verily
Captains of your own souls. In this
spot, sacred by so many memories, we
gather t opray a needed blessing upon
your heads, we gather t opray light unto
your path, and power unto your minds
and unto your hearts, that in fighting
for the things of life that have true
valu e,you may not fail. Conscious of
the task that has been given to us, we
shall not fear to tell you the kind of
strife upon which you enter; knowing
your native strength, knowing, too, the
mighty opportunities which have been
yours, we shall call you unto conflict,
confident that we can trust you to battle
manfully, even unto the end. Know
nig, finally, the victory that awaits your
effort, wc shall spur you on by the vi
sion of the place and of the reward
which must be yours.
"In these days, so crucical in our pub
li clife. I take it for granted that your
training in college has fitted you for the
high task of leadership, and that your
gifts of nature, your opportunities for
growth of spirit and for knowledge, put
upon you the obligation of turning aside
from every selfish interest which would
hinder you from taking a leader's place
among your fellows. 1 f you lead not,
tlien you fail. But a leader's place, in
our day, brings with it a weight of great
responsibility ; responsibility to your own
being, responsibility to your religious
aspirations, responsibility to our great
American ideals of democracy and of
freedom, responsibility to the aims of
the great place of learning which shelt
ers us today. You ,tre made in God's
own image and in your being you re
flect the beauty, the intelligence, the
peace, the love of God Himself, and you
owe unto Him who fashioned you thus,
to bring out more and more the Divine
outline. You believe that in God s hands
are the ends of the earth and that His
providential care marks your path ; you
believe that He is Light unto your mind
and Strength unto your weakness, if
you but put your trust in Him. You
believe that every man is your brother,
guarded by the Father's eternal love,
and because of the bond, you owe to
every man, not only what i* just, but
if you are strong, you must bend in
mercy to lift up the lowly. You believe
that there in no security, even in the
bargaining of the Nations if the moral
law and its binding sanctions impose
not it* dread majesty: if men act not for
conscience sake. \ou believe, as the
Founders of our Nation believed, that
our rulers may not trifle with the lives
and with the liberties of their subjects,
may not abuse the inborn rights of those
whom they rule, to forward class or
personal ambition. Nou believe, as our
Fathers taught, by word and by exam
pie, that our mighty inheritance is not
safe if men are not willing to sacrifice
all personal, petty ambition for the
greater good of the many.
