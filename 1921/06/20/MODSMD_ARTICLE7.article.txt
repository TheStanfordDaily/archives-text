# CAMPUS AUDIENCE ENJOYS BOOTH TARKINGTON PLAY
## 
### H. B. Rorke 
The Senior Farce "Clarence," which
was given Wednesday evening, in the
Assembly Hall, before one of the larg
est audiences ever attending a post
examination production, was a decided
success.
As usual, (he 8:15 curtain was raised
at 8:33 to accommodate the so-called
"wise-guys" who came straggling in
during the overture "Gems from the
Follies of 1892, or earlier, which was
Follies of 1892," or earlier, which was
being dealt with, according to its just
deserts by the Stanford University
Orchestra, (hree of whom actually
paid their sixty last March.
It's useless, though, for here the
odious is likewise impossible. As the
volunteer extemporaneous assistants
in the task of criticising remark, Claf
lin's acting could scarcely be praised
highly enough. Aside from his com
prehension and individuality which
makes his interpretation of "Clarence"
stand out as perhaps the best exhi
bition of comedian's acting seen on

the campus since Hector was eating
pup biscuits instead of wild meat.
Claflin is no less than a budding
genius on the saxaphone. Since com
mencing rehearsals about three weeks
ago, he has rescued his musical abili
ty from the darkness of five-finger
exercises on the upright and estab
lished it on the brilliant pinnacle of
success by his recital of the evening,
in the course of which he not only
tuned the baby grand with a monkey
wrench. but rendered "Home, Sweet
Home" with great feeling, as well as
"William Tell," which last number he
played on the "sax." Not exactly
played, but executed, y'know, (to re
mark after the manner of contempo
rary critics), as he had in the army
before they transfered him from the
band to the mule team.
Cora, the part taken by Lucile Mit
chell, called for the most sustaining
acting. Miss Mitchell was splendid.
There has never been a small sister
more small sisterly. With an unstilted
spontaneity in every wail and fratern
al fight, there was never a time when
her action did not dominate the scene.
From Cora's lips comes the best critic
ism of the play itself when she labeled
the lengthening question of Charles i
Short "tedious."
Finally, consider Hobby, who toileth
not, neither doth he spin. Finely was
his interpretation put over. Jerry
Powell, playing the amateur dissiloute
and Beau Brummel, who had "sorta
gotta reputation" for informally leav
ing expensive preparatory institutions
besides a live passion for spats and
his sister's governess and a dead one
for the Irish house-maid who threaten
ed breach of promise, delivered the
part in all the pristine freshness of
the original Bobby, whoever that is.
The acting of these three people was
easily superior to that of the rest of

the cast, and was characterized in
each case by an individuality of inter
pretation which made their parts uni
quely live and true.
Florence Pixley, as Miss Pinney
the governess, and Vera Pernau, who
played Mrs. Wheeler, a jealous step
mother, were both good. Miss Pixley's
satire and Miss Pernau's sweetness
were the outstanding features of their
acting, an unfortunate juxtaposition
which was in no way the fault of the
actresses. This lack of sympathy be
tween the actress and the part caused
a poor emphasis and dominance in the
character which might have been eli
minated as previous appearances have
proven both women capable of better
work, which latter fact saved the dis
crepancy from being more noticeable.
More credit is due Margaret Howard
and William Shiels for their fire and
excellent brogue, than the space al
lows. T. . Kennedy and Robert Pat
ton also carried their parts well and
Margaret Howard added a great deal
to the success of the comedy.

Claflin is no less than a budding
genius on the saxaphone. Since com
mencing rehearsals about three weeks
ago, he has rescued his musical abili
ty from the darkness of five-finger
exercises on the upright and estab
lished it on the brilliant pinnacle of
success by his recital of the evening,
in the course of which he not only
tuned the baby grand with a monkey
wrench. but rendered "Home, Sweet
Home" with great feeling, as well as
"William Tell," which last number he
played on the "sax." Not exactly
played, but executed, y'know, (to re
mark after the manner of contempo
rary critics), as he had in the army
before they transfered him from the
band to the mule team.
Cora, the part taken by Lucile Mit
chell, called for the most sustaining
acting. Miss Mitchell was splendid.
There has never been a small sister
more small sisterly. With an unstilted
spontaneity in every wail and fratern
al fight, there was never a time when
her action did not dominate the scene.
From Cora's lips comes the best critic
ism of the play itself when she labeled
the lengthening question of Charles i
Short "tedious."
Finally, consider Hobby, who toileth
not, neither doth he spin. Finely was
his interpretation put over. Jerry
Powell, playing the amateur dissiloute
and Beau Brummel, who had "sorta
gotta reputation" for informally leav
ing expensive preparatory institutions
besides a live passion for spats and
his sister's governess and a dead one
for the Irish house-maid who threaten
ed breach of promise, delivered the
part in all the pristine freshness of
the original Bobby, whoever that is.
The acting of these three people was
easily superior to that of the rest of

the cast, and was characterized in
each case by an individuality of inter
pretation which made their parts uni
quely live and true.
Florence Pixley, as Miss Pinney
the governess, and Vera Pernau, who
played Mrs. Wheeler, a jealous step
mother, were both good. Miss Pixley's
satire and Miss Pernau's sweetness
were the outstanding features of their
acting, an unfortunate juxtaposition
which was in no way the fault of the
actresses. This lack of sympathy be
tween the actress and the part caused
a poor emphasis and dominance in the
character which might have been eli
minated as previous appearances have
proven both women capable of better
work, which latter fact saved the dis
crepancy from being more noticeable.
More credit is due Margaret Howard
and William Shiels for their fire and
excellent brogue, than the space al
lows. T. . Kennedy and Robert Pat
ton also carried their parts well and
Margaret Howard added a great deal
to the success of the comedy.
The Senior Farce "Clarence," which
was given Wednesday evening, in the
Assembly Hall, before one of the larg
est audiences ever attending a post
examination production, was a decided
success.
As usual, (he 8:15 curtain was raised

Follies of 1892," or earlier, which was

It's useless, though, for here the
odious is likewise impossible. As the
volunteer extemporaneous assistants
in the task of criticising remark, Claf

highly enough. Aside from his com
prehension and individuality which
makes his interpretation of "Clarence"
stand out as perhaps the best exhi

the campus since Hector was eating
