# CAMPUS AUDIENCE ENJOYS BOOTH TARKINGTON PLAY
## 
### H. B. Rorke 
The Senior Farce "Clarence," which
was given Wednesday evening, in the
Assembly Hall, before one of the larg
est audiences ever attending a post
examination production, was a decided
success.
As usual, (he 8:15 curtain was raised
at 8:33 to accommodate the so-called
"wise-guys" who came straggling in
during the overture "Gems from the
