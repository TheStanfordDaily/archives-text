### 
William Leiser read the 1917 Class
Will at close day exercises, as follows:
We, The CLASS OF 1921, anticipat
ing the day when we shall make our
last corporeal appearance on the Stan
ford Farm, after which we must depart
the life of Stanford activity, being sound
of mind, body, and understanding, do
hereby request the following disposition
of our rights in spiritual and worldly
possessions.
To Daniel Evans we leave responsi
bility for guidance of student affairs,
knowing that he will receive to the ful
lest extent the cooperation of the stu
dent community in all that will make
the Stanford student body a powerful
unit.
To Harry J. Borba we leave control
of the Daily Palo Alio, trusting that
under his supervision the official stu
dent publication will be a strong coor
dinating camput influence standing ac
tively for all that will build up Stan
ford.
The leadership of the football squad
we reserve to Jack Patrick, charging
him thgt many surprises (to outsiders)
are in order when on next November
he leads the 1921 eleven against the
well touted "wonder team", in Stan
ford's new stadium.
Track we leave to Kenny Wright
and "Dink" Templeton, who have al
ready begun to develop the cinder path
strength tor the coming year.
Baseball must go to George Green.
To Jimmie Davies we leave leadership
of the Stanford five, which we hope
may continue to hold first place in the
Coast Conference. To Phil Neer, who
even now is matching the Cardinal
against eastern court competition we
leave the destinies of Tennis for the
year to come.
To these five captains, to leaders of
minor sports as well, to yell leader Con
nolly, to all officials, and all loyal sup
porters of Stanford teams we leave,
more than the responsibility for victory
in 1921, the Stanford reputation for
fighting spirit, and for clean sports
manship.
Sombreros we must bequeath to 1922;
Corduroys to 1923, frosh dinks to 1925,
and semester shirts to all, hoping that
the beneficiaries may find more than oc
casional use for these traditional em
blems of Stanford democracy.
A new Stanford Union, a basketball
pavilion and a new stadium, we leave
to all members of the student body, with
the charge that they be utilized to their
fullest extent in the new era of Stan
ford progress.
By indisputable right of custom and
tradition we make the foregoing dispo
sition of privileges, and responsibilities;
yet in each case we have left the priv
ileges and duties with those students
who of their own merit have earned
the right to them.
Yet we, the Class of 1921, about to
receive the diploma which severs us
from active participation in student af
fairs, arc desirous of leaving to the un
dergraduate student body something
which is definitely our own to give, and
which, unless we do give it. will be, in
so far as we are concerned, lost to Stan
ford.
Wc, the Class of 1921. leave to the
new undergraduate student body and to
all bodies to come, our lasting, sincere
pledge of loyalty to them, and to Stan
ford. In connection with this we charge
them that they make use of the right
of calling on the members of 1921. when
ever it may be within our power to aid
a little to the progress of the Cardinal.
This bequest is made, not with the at
titude of the man who has taken all
and given little, but with the viewpoint
of men and women who know that we
have received much that has been made
possible only by the sacrifice of others;
and on departing we wish to leave this
pledge, that we will ever stand ready to
do our part as graduates in a Univer
sity whose strength will rest to a tre
mendous extent with its alumni.
