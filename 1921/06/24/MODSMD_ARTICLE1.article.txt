# STANFORD TENNIS MEN WIN FIRST PLACES IN DARTMOUTH MATCHES
## Neer and Davies Add New Victories to List Following Dual Tournaments in East 
### 
â€¢ Nearing the close of the dual tourna
ments of the eastern invasion, the Stan
ford Tennis team added another vic
tory to its long list Saturday by defeat
ing Dartmouth. Friday afternoon Nees
and Dorris handed out the first defeat
of the season to the strong Amherst
racquet squad. This match proved to
be the hardest competition encountered
by the Cardinal racquet men on their
trip and both singles matches were very
close. Due to limited time for travel,
the Stanford team was forced to default
the doubles match.
In the first match of the singles play,
Jimmy Davies of the Cardinal squad de
feated Snyder of Amherst in two close
sets. 6-4, 6-3. The Amherst man feat
ured in the match with his serve and
made many aces during the match but
could not compete with the accurate
placing o fthe Stanford player. Cap
tain Phil Neer of Stanford encountered
some difficulty in defeating his oppo
nent in th esecond match, the second
set going to 12 games. Titus who faced
Neer, played a good game but Neer
was steadier in the pinches and won out,
6-4, 7-5.
With but few matches left to play
before the annual intercollegiate champ
ionships of the United States to be held
this year at the Merion Cricket Club
of Haverford, Pa., June 28, the Cardi
nal players have a chance to make an
unequalled record in the East.
Getting away to a bad start at the
first ol the season due to the participa
tion in other sports and the lack of
proper condition, the Stanford tennis
team has come back and has well justi
fied the making of tennis a major sport
at Stanford. Since the defeat in the
dual tournament with the University of
California on the Stanford courts ear
lier in the spring, the Cardinal team
has won the Ojai open singles champion
