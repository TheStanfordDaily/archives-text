# THE 						"SUMMER DAILY"
## 
### 
This issue of the "Daily Palo Alto" is published by the Associated
Students as the first issue of the weekly summer student official organ,
it is authorized by the A. S. S. U. that it may as far as possible meet the
requirement of a student publication during the coming three months.
Since the number of registered students is almost double that of last
summer, and activity may be correspondingly increased, it may be pos
sible later to publish twice each week. In the meantime the "Daily"
itends to act as best it may in promoting the progress of a smooth and
â€¢tive "odd" quarter.
The "Daily" welcomes student comment and criticism, on any sub
:t. and will cheerfully print all signed communications that are received,
udents who desire the help or aid of the "Daily" in any worthy object
are requested to ask for it.
