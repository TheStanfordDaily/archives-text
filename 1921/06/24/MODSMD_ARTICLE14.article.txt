# A 						WORTH-WHILE HOUR
## 
### 
The fact that Dir. Wilbur will speak to the students Wednesday is in
itself more than sufficient reason why every old student will be at the
Assembly Hall at 11:00 a.m. The President never comes before the
students without giving them a great deal of information, and never
fails to leave increased enthusiasm for Stanford.
In order that new students, and students visiting Stanford for the
first time become acquainted with the ways of the Farm, they of course
will not fail to take advantage of hearing from men who hold respon
sible positions in regular student activity. They will learn something of
Stanford activity, what they may expect when they enter the normal year
next fall, and what part we all may play in promoting an enjoyable and
worthwhile student life this summer.
