# "A 'SELF-STARTER' MUSTRUN THE RISKS OF LEADERSHIP"
## --Dr. Wilbur Speaks to Graduates—- 
### 
"He who leads must take the risks
leadership," Dr. Wilbur said in speak
ing to the graduating class last Satur
day. His address complete is as fol
lows:
"Today this University sets free half
a thousand trained minds to go out
into the complicated society organized
through countless generations by hu
man beings who have well nigh con
quered the earth through physical
skill, courage, cooperative effort, and
Intellect. These Stanford minds will
soon merge into the great mass of hu
man power, and we wonder when we
see you start fresh from our walls
whether you will soon be submerged
and lost or whether your qualities are
such that, as time goes by, you will
stand out here and there above the
general crowd. Mankind proceeds for
ward as a mighty stream of water
goes along over uneven ground. Some
particles of water must lead at every
point. Some rivulets get into blind
pockets and some dry up while others,
pursuing the path favored by the laws
of physics, cut through obstructions
and bear a mighty current. Each drop
of water in the lead must run the risks
of leadership. Pushed by mighty
forces there is no escape. Mankind,
though, can control its course and the
rate of its progress and in our advance
the units possess the power of optional
leadership. You as a thinking person,
an educated trained unit, must soon
decide by your daily choices whether
you are to lead or to follow, whether

you are to run the risks of the advance
guard or to float along in the rear.
Your own initiative must decide
whether you are to be a "self-starter"
or whether some one must turn the
crank that sets you in motion. Are you
to learn to give orders or are you to
take them?
"Self-Starters Are Needed"
The world needs self-starters ask
ing "why?" and showing "how." Man
is a social animal, slowly and pain
fully building up a social structure in
which all must have a helpful part.
But if we look at history we find that
the acts of single individuals have
time after time molded the progress
of all. A Julius Ceasar, a Napoleon, a
Lincoln or an Edison changes the
course of history for whole peoples.
The contributions of individuals have
been so great that many have been
alarmed when some of our social insti
tutions have shown signs of taking
the dead level of common mediocrity.
In fact, we see on all sides struggles
between the individuals and the mass.
Each day our law-makers compromise
between the rights of the individual
and the rights of the public. Our most
sacred possession in America is the
retention of the power of the initiative
of the individual —and yet we feel that
the majority must rule. Each meas
ure for the good of the social organism
may be at the cost of some individual
or group. How can we avoid the dan
ger of turning out a pattern citizen
the way we turn out industrial pat
terns, if we encroach too far upon the
individual? The whole subject is a
blend of rights, duties, selfishness,
common good, altruism, morals and re
ligion.
The Anglo-Saxon has considered
each mentally sound person as inde
pendent and capable of making up his
own mind. We have tolerated that
most unsocial being, the conscientious
objector, even in the midst of the
greatest common danger. Our respect
has often gone out. to the man who
was true to himself, as he conceived
himself, even though it made him a
burden upon society. Every public
health measure for the common wel
fare has to fight its way against in
dividual desires and so-called rights.
Were it possible for each to take the
full effects of his own acts the rest
of us would be unconcerned. But our
ltves are so interlocked that no one
can live unto himself. All individual
rights must be viewed in the light of
the rights of others and of duty to
otaers. There is a harsh, selfish, al
most savage strain in all of us. In
some it never seems to flicker into
sight, their lives having fallen in soft
places. But anyone who sees men or
women under strain and fatigue, or
struggling for life, realizes the com
manding strength of the elemental hu
man qualities. It. requires some exhi
bition of selfishness to take care of
oneself and one's family. The man or
woman who finds out when to be gen
erous, when to add his strength to
that of the team, does the most for
the future. It is natural with the in
herited drive that most of us Ameri
cans have implanted in us, that in
dividualism should at times be carried

to the extreme in our thoughts and
deeds. The early history of any West
ern town gave full play to that acme
of individualism, the self-reliant, self
sustained American pioneer. It took
emergencies to get team play out of
such wonderful men. But Americans
are not alone in this trait. Michelet
told Matthew Arnold, in speaking of
that country where Liberty, Equality
and Fraternity are the watch-words,
"France is a nation of barbarians civi
lized by the conscription." When we
think of rights and freedom we are at
once reminded of the story of the man
who said, "I have the right to shake
my fist in the face of anyone," and of
the man who answered, "Your right
to shake your fist in my face ends
where my nose begins," and of the
man whose graphic career of individ
ualism was portrayed in this epitaph:
Here lies of body of Jonathan Ray
Who died; maintaining his Right of
Way.
He was right, dead right, as he sped
along;
But he's just as dead as if he'd been
wrong.
Individualism and Selfishness
We have all seen the man who goes
ahead as he likes and the bills that
others pay for his gross selfishness.
We know the man who climbs up on
the bodies of those crushed by him.
We know those who ride through life
on the fortunes accumulated by others
from others. We at times see the sel
fish apparently successful individuals
of whom Seneca said, "Money tumbles
into the hands of certain men as a
shilling tumbles down a sewer."
We know the man who thinks lie
knows just what ho is entitled to and
demands it down to the last pound,
even though that, pound be flesh.
Where, then, are we to draw the line
between the individual and society?
How are we to maintain the neces
sary leadership without suffering too

much from the abuses of individuals?
Where are the lines of compromise
and conformity to be? How can you
serve the mass without losing yourself
completely in it? The great thing is
not to confuse your rights with your
duties. Your duties are to your neigh
bors as well as to yourself. You can
be an individualist, you can retain the
blessing of initiative and without det
riment to others but to their profit, if
your goal is their good and your acts
are wise. You must stand ready to
bow to the will of the majority to se
cure order and harmony by so doing
you must sacrifice something funda
mental to your integrity as a human
being. You can lead in forming the
majority opinion that will control for
all. You can make your brain work
to solve new problems in any field of
knowledge into which you are willing
to plough deeply. You can be a self
starter for the no-man's land of hu
man knowledge where new facts are
to be found if you can find a way
through the barbed wire, the pools and
the zones of fire. You can serve in
110 new way if you are content to fol
low with the others up and down the
protected trenches.
As an educated man or woman you
must respect the established in life,
but not accept it without question.
While we have retained much of super
stition and childishness, for the most
part the things that were found wisest
to do have been passed 011 to the new
generations. The wise old observers
who formulated the basis of conduct
found in the Old Testament, knew hu
man nature and knew the results that
follow good and bad action and mo
tive in ordinary life. One of our com
mon mistakes is to want to tear things
down just because they exist. It is
the carry over into adult life of the
natural destructiveness and curiosity
of the young. Old heads have learned
that time compels us to keep 011 build
ing and that it is wise to at least keep
a firm retaining hold on known foun
dations. Unless you are willing to
listen to the of history and feel
stirring within you the desire to build
and not to destroy, look out for the
siren song of the emotional radical.
All the world knows now that it is
better to live within the much patched
framework of sane government than
to knock down all the barriers.
Blind Conformity Means
Lack of Progress
We know the power of inherited
compulsions and of traditions. Your
education should have made you a
thinking man, you should be ruled by
"know-how" compulsions. Blin3 con
formity by everyone to the rules of
the past means that the procession is
going back into the tent. It is dis
turbing to hear educated men spoken
of as the college type, the fraternity
type, or the society type. It is dead
ening to think of the crushing of the
initiative in our best minds that ac
company the processes that lead to
such results. For our race goes for
ward to better things, only when it
tests the old tries the new and is led
by the capable individualist with so
cial sense. Only that society that
g'ves freedom to its best can hope to
survive in this present small economic
world with its short-lived, fragile bio
logical units requiring constant nutri
tion, recreation and an increased
amount of preparation for useful life.
Don't confuse freedom with the per
centage of a poison in a beverage. We
must be aleri not to be over standard
ized by the processes of education or
of social living. It is particularly im
portant that you who have spent a
third of your whole life as students
should not thereby have become
"course-broke" and think of life as a
series of set. courses, the contents of
which have been chosen by someone
else. Your chance to be a leader, to
be a "self-starter," will depend on
your ability to get away from the idea
that an education is a mere insistence
upon a certain series of facts. You
may have in your mind a mixture of
general or professional facts, hut it is
your method of thought and your ca
pacity to keep your thinking machine
working all of your life that will de
termine your career. There are many
so-called educated men whose minds
crystallize early and we get from them
merely the reflections of habit and
tradition and even superstition. Such
minds develop when men fool them
selves, as someone has said, by using
their intellects to defend the decisions
of their emotions and prejudices.
It requires activity of intelligence to
get anywhere. The machine must
work and constantly use its motive
power. It takes a whole lot of men
tal activity of the ordinary type with
a comparative uniformity of cultural

and intellectual level to produce a
Hoover. In the great and small de
cisions of the world, each has a part.
A thousand influences are at work all
of the time upon the individual in his
development of the capacity to do and
to think. Mother, home, school, news
paper, preacher, hills, oceans, animals,
plants, farms, shops, universities,
teachers all develop character and in
fluence thought processes. A clean
environment affects the central ner
vous system in a multitude of ways
and results in a high percentage of
clean, orderly thoughts. The human
beings with whom we associate have
a more potent influence than the ma
terial things about us. The intellect
needs the surroundings of high pur
pose and contacts witli the best for
full development. Unconsciously we
do many things that we see others do.
The monkey quality of imitation is
such a strong trait in most men and
women that one is tempted to believe
in evolution simply from watching the
acceptance of the varying styles of
dress. No one escapes the crowd. Lan
guage, clothes, habits of thoughts are
caught as if by contagion from those
about (.us. But we must not catch too
much. We must remain free moral
thinking agents in spite of the needs
of our conformity with the rest.
Just as every man may make his
own hell even though he simply fol
lows the crowd, so likewise he may
make his own heaven by his own acts.
To state that "everyone is doing it"
does not reduce the cost to the in
dividual when the time comes to pay
the price for foolishness.
University Gives
Personal Relationships
One great thing that university
training gives is a wonderful increase
in the number and quality of personal
relationships. These come not only
from the professors and comsades but
from contact with the great minds
that have contributed to human knowl
edge. Think of the variety of human
beings that play a part in the thoughts
and actions of each of us each day.
Every book, every newspaper, every
laboratory hour, offers contacts with
dozens of men of the past and of the
present. Crowd effects are so potent
that at times the i ndividual seems
hopelessly lost. Collective minds seem
to flow in a tidal wave. But the
thinker, the man who knows and who
has courage, whose emotions are
strong and who can still be tolerant
and critical, and not lose his head —
can eventually lead. At times it may
be foolish to buck the tide of human
sentiment and emotion and to have no
energy left for other things. Probably
the happiest people are the ones we
call the "cranks." They have pulled
out of the crowd, freed themselves
from everything but a dominant idea
or two and pursue that to their heart's
content. The crank of today is some
times the hero of tomorrow, but most
cranks are mere bell ringers going
from one defeat to another. Dominant
ideas are splendid if they are good
ideas. It is well for your peace of
soul and for your future attainments
to be something of a crank along some
well thought out line. Perhaps we
must look to the people with crank
ideas to save the individual age that
some feel is now going to be replaced
by the mere unit age of industrial life.
We feel the pressure of such an

age with the growing interdependence
of our society, with the new and pros
sing importance of economics in or
dinary life. The world now under
stands that there must be profound
studies of the inexorable laws of na
ture so that our future decisions can
be based more on fact. It's almost
atnusing to see nations, through their
elected representatives, trying to leg
islate the way out of economic con
fusion. The blind faith in a law built
up out of compromise as a cure of
feconomic ills has its origin in the same
kind of thought and belief that has
made well named mixtures of drugs
into gold mines.
Educated men must turn to legisla
tion and political life. They must
serve as experts in collective living
as they provide trained services to in
dividuals or corporations. If you are
to help in the political life or in the
economic life, you have to study ques
tions and act as one of a great group
seeking a conclusion by majority
choice and as an individual of free
choice.
With the passing of royal preroga
tive and of decisions by one man on
the problems of a people and the de
velopment of governments with par
ticipating citizenship the safety of a
nation rests entirely on the education
and discipline of the individual units.
When the majority at any given elec
tion passes laws upon which our fu
ture may depend, the need of study
and of teamwork and of willing and
reliable leadership is imperative. Only
that people is safe that will rely large
ly upon the knowledge of the expert,
of the man who knows. The quack
legislator can be as damaging to the
body politic as the quack practioner
to the physical body. We suffer great
ly from the man who uses his fluent
voice to play upon passions and pre
judices for his own advancement. The
most loveable quality of the human
being is said to be his credulity, his
faith in the spoken or written word.
Without knowledge and thought how
can one form a judgment? Opinions
are important, but they are often mere
obstinate thought groups. We must
look out not to rely too much on
them, for, like the Bogie Man, "the
facts will get you if you don't watch
out." The way upward is difficult
enough even with the help of every
known fact. You will find that most
men are activated more by their emo
tions than by their intellect. Deep
emotions, deep religious feeling con
trolled by reason and calmed by re
sponsibility make the best combina
tion for service to your fellows. To
lie effective you must be willing to
cross lines. Do not be sterilized. You
can be dominated by a few ideas, but
* not be disposed of by a single work
classification whether that word re
s to race, family, religion, educa
occupation, political party, fra
ternity or your economic state. Politics
needs new ideas and ideals. Any hu
man institution must grow or it is
dying. The new needs of government
must not be met by killing the ad
vance guard or by leveling processes.
All have an equal right to be helped
by government and to get justice, but
wq have varying abilities to render
such service. More favored than the
rest by these years of protection and
support while you were preparing for
the future, it is to you that the others
turn for help. The self reliance and
self expression made possible by edu
cation belongs to all and not to you
alone. Facts and great ideals, not
emotions or prejudices, must rule. For
you as individuals the majority rule
of a democracy will have its crosses,
but the tyranny of a majority is better
than that of a minority, and majori
ties can be educated and led if the in
dividual reaches out to help the rest.
True, much of our life will have to be
controlled by what Morley calls the
acceptance of "second best opinions."
Only here and there will we live up
to our best. The poorest and the best
often neutralize each other, and those
in between have their way.
Life may be full of disillusionments
for you. Some things that seem to
have glamour in the romantic light of
evening sparkle very little in the
clear sunshine. Little mistakes some
times cause big bills. Life seems un
fair at times. You can be easiest
fooled if you let petty wants stop your
pursuit of things worth while. If you
are misguided and aspire only for the
decoration of the dollar, remember
(he old saying that "a strong box is
worth just what it holds." But if your
purposes are big, and if you keep your
individual character and your sense
of duty to the crowd, you can best
serve and you can conjure happiness
at will.
The University expects much of
you. You are full members of the
great. Stanford family. The inde
pendence you have learned here com
bined with the capacity for team play
will make you fit into a useful place
wherever you may go. It is a great
privilege to have been started along
the highway of a useful life. Our
hearts will be with you and our eyes
upon you.
"Have Foresight,
Not Hesitation"
You now have your degrees and have
learned some of the principles of navi
gation on the sea of life. Above all
launch your ship and begin to steer.
'No ship reaches a new port that hugs
the safe home harbor. Have fore
sight. not hesitation. New winds may
blow outside to favored shores, but
you will never know it. if you wait
for the crowd to start. Work with
what you have and constantly add
more. Be a self-starter. Germinate
your own motive power. Accept the
challenge of Louis Ginsburg:
Let me not hide behind the pane,
Too sheltered and too snugly warm;
But let me drink the wind of fight
And brave the buffets of the storm!
From every torper set me free —
Past rocks of struggle make me fling
My spirit's waters into song,
As boulders make the brook to sing!
