# Full History of 1921 Class Read Saturday at Class Day Function
## 
### 
P. F. Erickson read the following
history of the 1921 class at class day
exercises last Saturday, which was
published in part in the commence
ment issue of the Daily Palo Alto:
A true history of the class of 1921
would be more than a compilation of
the events of the past four years in
which the members of this class have
played a part. It would rather be a
history of Stanford during the past
four years. But such an undertaking
would at the present moment be too
stupendous a task. However, it is en
tirely fitting that as we are about to
enter the ranks of the alumni that we
should leave some record of the part
that we have played during the past
four years.
It was in the fall of 1917, when re
ports were coming to us of the great
battle of the Aisne and the British of
fensive on the fields of Flanders, that
the members of the class of '21 caught
their first glimpse of the long arcades
of the university that was to become
their Alma Mater. No sooner was the
rush of registration over thau we
gained our first introduction to the
more intensive life of the farm when
we fought with the members of the
class of '20 on the "Deke" lawn and
subsequently on the football field and
whom* we eventually defeated in the
baseball fight, the last offensive of the
underclass hostilities of the year.
Of the events that occurred that fall
perhaps the most vivid are those of
the week which ended in our fisrt
Big Game. Under the leadership of
Edward Braunschweiger we aided in
building up the proper Big Game spirit
by building a bonfire which we faith
fully guarded against the Santa Clar
ans. Then came the Big Game itself
and we saw Santa Clara's better team
go down in defeat before Stanford's
greater team.
Three of our classmates helped win
that last big rugby battle —Stedman
Falk, Fred Adams, and "Cap" Camp
bell, Only a week before our Fresh
man football team, under the captaincy
of "Charlie" Doe, defeated Santa
Clara's Freshman 16 to 8. Subsequent
ly in basketball, track and baseball
we were less successful. Our Fresh
man basketball team was captained by
"Walt" Phelps, our track team led by
Kenny Wright, and our baseball team
by C. W. Teubner. It was during this
year that many 1921 athletes were de
veloped who have since played a ma
jor part in building up Stanford's ath
letic glory. In the realm of football
we have "Jack" Patrick, next year's
Varsity captain; Fred Adams, "Pret"
Holt, and the captain of this year's
Varsity, "Art" Wilcox. On the basket
ball teams of the last three years
"Bert" Mills, Fred Adams, and "Dick"
Richmond have played an essential
part in the winning of the champion
ship of the Pacific Coast Conference of
last year and the Stanford-California
series of this year. Nineteen twenty
one men who have carried Stanford's
banner in track are "Flint" Hanner,
Norman Scofield, Norman Green, "Art"
Wilcox, and Kenny Wright. In base
ball, Floyd Kallam, "Doug" Bundy,
Harvey Newlands, and Mortimer Kline
have been brilliant players. During
the brief revivial of crew three 1921
men have rowed against the California
eight—"Al" Cary, Fred Adams, and
Lyman Wilbur.
Near the close of our Freshman year
vame a call from Italy for ambulance
units. Hundreds of Stanford men of
fered to serve in Italy and of the eight
finally chosen from Stanford two were
members of the class of 1921, namely
H. H. Darling and Howard Gould.
When perhaps the majority of us
came back for our Sophomore year
we found that the University had been
turned into a veritable military and
naval training camp. In the months
that followed practically all '21 men
who had returned were to be seen in
khaki or navy blue. With the signing
of the armistice those in the various
fields of service gradually returned and
during the ensuing Winter Quarter the
Campus assumed a normal appearance.
It was during that quarter that 1921
presented its Sophomore play, "His
Majesty, Bunker Bean," starring Doro
thy Johnston and Floyd McElroy.
Among the chief events of the fol
lowing year is the renewal of the Big

Game with the University of Califor
nia. After an interval of fourteen
years Stanford and California met once
again in American football. Stanford's
Varsity, fighting against a perfect foot
ball machine which had taken years
in the building, won for itself undying
fame. Coach Evans readily gave the
first place on that team to one of '21's
greatest football players, "Pret" Holt.
Then in the spring came Junior Week,
featured by the "Prom" with its Ori
ental canopies and Arab sheik punch
dealers and which was foLlowed by the
Junior opera in which Lorraine West
took the leading role.
It is not alone in the field of ath
letics and dramatics that members of
the class of '21 have contributed their
share in the development of success
ful undergraduate activities. In the
field of journalism much progress has
been made. A new publication has
been developed during the last year,
the "Pictorial." Its first editor was
Robert Kenny, who was followed by
Jessee Thrash. The Daily Palo Alto
has been edited by Earl Crowe and
William Leiser. Floyd McElroy was
editor of the 1921 Quad, and Warren
P. Lewis is the present editor of the
"Cardinal."
Prominent in the forensic field are
W. F. Leiser, who has participated in
the Joffre Medaille debate since his
Freshman year; Paul Erickson, who
has represented Stanford against the
Universities of Southern California
and Oregon, and David Tannenbaum,
a member of this year's Tri-State team.
But the '21 members of the "500"
have also given their energies and
their initiative in service for Stanford
in the various fields of undergraduate
activity. Among the student leaders
among tire women of Stanford are
Dorothy Johnston, who has been presi
dent of the Women's Council during
the past year; Frederika McGee, who
has been prominent in various forms
of women's athletics, Hester Proctor,
president of the Women's Athletic As
sociation; Elizabeth Patton, president
of the Young Women's Christian Asso
ciation, and vice-president of Organ
ized Women; and Anne Hardy, who
has served on various service boards.
Of the many members of the class
that have served Stanford during the
last four years the first place of honor
must be given to those who gave their
the Convalescent Home, and an annual
Alumni Day Reunion during the Spring
Quarter has been established.
As President Wilbur has so fitly ex
pressed it, there has been a turn in
the tide of affairs of Stanford. Stan
ford has been given a new national
reputation as a great University by
being chosen as the seat for the estab
lishment of an Institute of Food Re
search by the Carnegie Corporation.
The work of this Institute will be un
der the supervision of two of the ten
leading scientists of the country—Dr.
Alonzo E. Taylor and Dr. Charles M.
Alsberg. A Converse Scholarship Fund
of fifty thousand dollars has been
granted the University. The erection
lives in supreme sacrifice during the
war. May the names of Kenneth Rus
sell and Solomon Zeorian never be
forgotten, for they gave the greatest
measure of service to their country
and University.
The past year has been a notable
one in the achievements made by the
undergraduate student body. There
has been realized a spirit of coopera
tion between students, faculty, and
alumni far above our first expectations.
New traditions have been established
and new responsibilities assumed. No
one has worked harder in the achieve
ment of progress in student body af
, fairs than Floyd McElroy, president
of the Associated Students.
Thus we have briefly reviewed the
part that Nineteen Twenty-One has
played in four years of Stanford's his
tory. That class is now about to enter
upon new duties and to assume new
responsibilities. What ils achieve
ments in the future will be must re
main for other chroniclers to tell. Put
the members of the class of Nineteen
Twenty-One, men and women alike,
bearing upon them the seal of Stan
ford, will not fail in being true to the
highest expression of the Stanford
Spirit of service for God, for Country,
and for Stanford.
