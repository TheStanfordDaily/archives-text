A very unfortunate thing hap
pened at the Senior Ball, when
President Wilbur so generously
allowed the class of 1921 full use
of his home for their function.
A highly valued gift basket was
stolen.
This may have been done
thoughtlessly. Such acts put
estimable Stanford traditions,
such as roughing, in jopardy.
The basket was a gift and was
prized highly by Mrs. Wilbur. If
any one can aid in returning it,
or present information concern
ing it, the service will be greatly
appreciated.
