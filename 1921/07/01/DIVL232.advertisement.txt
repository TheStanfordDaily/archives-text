Importers,

ship and sail under
the Stars and Stripes
THERE are today few
ports in the world of
importance to shippers or
travelers, which cannot be
reached by ships that sail
under the Stars and Stripes.
President Harding has
said that, "We cannot sell
successfully where we do
not carry". The American
Merchant Marine that once
almost vanished is again an
established and important
carrier of the world's com
merce.
You can ship or sail any
where in American ships
designed for utmost com
fort and safety.
