# THE PRINCIPLE' IS DISCUSSED AT TUESDAY LECTURE
## "Authority and Responsibility Should Lie Together"â€”Is Message of George Dillman 
### Bertha Vaughan, '22 
"Authority and Responsibility should
lie together," said George L. Dillman,
in an informal talk given on "The
Principle," in the Little Theater, last
night.
"When a man is given responsibility
he must in all cases have the authority
to execute it," this is the basic teach

later by Mr. Dillman and first read
before the San Francisco Association
of the American Society of Civil Engi

more than the right to do," said Mr.
Dillman, "It includes the power, the
strength, the know-how to do it, in
short, all of the co-relative means with
the to use them. Responsibility
is a burden to be carried; it may be
acquired, public or private, but no
matter what its nature, it is always
something to be borne."

Mr. Dillman, "is a human trait which
has become far too prevalent."

get it yourself. It is an idea, and is
worthless unless it is yours by con
viction. When it is yours by convic

with very satisfactory results. The
Principle is the sole measure of great
ness and applies to each individual,
group, or nation. It is a scale which
measures us all, and the thing which
will justify ourselves to our own
souls," continued Mr. Dillman.
"The Principle itself is very simple,"
said Mr. Dillman. "it is the applica

These complications come from viola
tions. The purpose of education is to
enable the individual to analyze com
