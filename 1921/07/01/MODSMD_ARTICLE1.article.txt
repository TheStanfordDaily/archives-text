# THE 						PRINCIPLE' IS DISCUSSED AT TUESDAY LECTURE
## "Authority and Responsibility Should Lie Together"â€”Is Message of George Dillman 
### Bertha Vaughan, '22 
"Authority and Responsibility should
lie together," said George L. Dillman,
in an informal talk given on "The
Principle," in the Little Theater, last
night.
"When a man is given responsibility
he must in all cases have the authority
to execute it," this is the basic teach
ing of the Principle which was formu
later by Mr. Dillman and first read
before the San Francisco Association
of the American Society of Civil Engi
neers, in 1916. "By authority is meant
more than the right to do," said Mr.
Dillman, "It includes the power, the
strength, the know-how to do it, in
short, all of the co-relative means with
the to use them. Responsibility
is a burden to be carried; it may be
acquired, public or private, but no
matter what its nature, it is always
something to be borne."
The desire for leadership is natural,
pointed out Mr. Dillman, and the re
verse is true of responsibility. The
latter is something which is instinct
ively avoided and in this separation
of authority and responsibility lies
the trouble. "Passing the buck," said
Mr. Dillman, "is a human trait which
has become far too prevalent."
"The Principle should not be accept
ed on another's say-so; you have to
get it yourself. It is an idea, and is
worthless unless it is yours by con
viction. When it is yours by convic
tion it will be, put into daily practice
with very satisfactory results. The
Principle is the sole measure of great
ness and applies to each individual,
group, or nation. It is a scale which
measures us all, and the thing which
will justify ourselves to our own
souls," continued Mr. Dillman.
"The Principle itself is very simple,"
said Mr. Dillman. "it is the applica
tion of it, which is often complex.
These complications come from viola
tions. The purpose of education is to
enable the individual to analyze com
plex cases in order to apply the Prin
ciple, and such an analysis in the light
of the Principle will settle the case
and settle it right."
There are three "dont's" which the
Principle teaches; "don't butt in, don't
shirk responsibility, and don't let
others butt into your affairs." The last
named, said Dr. Dillman, was the vio
lation which was the cause of our
recent war with Germany. "The
idea is not Utopian," he continued.
"It is very practical and will serve
to put the meddler out of business."
Mr. Dillon, who held the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel in charge of the
railroad work in France during the
war, exhibited the practicability of
the Principle in the organization of
the men under him at that time. He
quoted from a letter received from
one of his officers who was sent into
Russia in regard to the Principle, in
which he said: "It has kept me out
of a great deal of trouble and has got
me out of all I got into."
"The Principle is a natural law, not
an invention," said Mr. Dillman. It
has been followed by almost all great
men even though they have not formu
lated it. It was taught by Christ and
its application is apparent in studying
the lives and work of Francis Bacon,
Lincoln, Daniel Webster and other
great men."
The Principle applies to every activ
ity of human life. In the family the
happiest results are obtained when
the members are in accord, each re
cognizing their own and the other's
responsibility and granting the autho
itv for its execution. The same is
true in a business organization where
full or partial failures can usually be
traced to a violation of the Principle.
It has a direct bearing on the rela
-1 tions of capital and labor and through
the recognition of the authority and
; responsibility of each by the other,
| results.
: To substantiate his statement, that
the Principle is now being practiced
! to some extent, Mr. Dillman read a
I number of citations from well-known
! leaders who approved of the Principle
and stated that they had been apply
i ing it with valuable result to the vari
| ous organizations which they repre
| sent.
