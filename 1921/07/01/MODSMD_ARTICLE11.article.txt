# PRESIDENT WILBUR AND A.S.S.U. MEMBERS SPEAK AT ASSEMBLY
## "Work, Worship, Play and Love" All Found on Stangord Campus 
### 
"Work, worship, play and love, have
been named as the principal elements
of life," said President Wilbur in wel
coming the students at the first sum
mer assembly, Wednesday, "and from
my observation we may say that the
same elements, in a measure, are
found on the Stanford campus. We
come here primarily to work. There
are certainly opportunities for wor
ship, and there is opportunity for play.
And some of the things I have seen
here indicate that there is also some

thing Dr. Wilbur indicated
particularly that the elements should
be considered in relative importance
in the order stated.
"We are very jealous of the name of
Stanford," said the President.
Following Dr. Wilbur's welcome,
students took charge of the assembly,
William Leiser acting as chairman.
Explaining that the student program
was by way of introducing new stu
dents to membership in the Stanford
student body, he first introduced Miss
Frederica McGee, as representative
of the women of the University. Miss
McGee spoke particularly to the wo
men students, saying that membership
in the "500" involves privileges as
well as duties, urging all to partake of
both.
Everett Layman next spoke of some
of Stanford's staditions, emphasizing
the importance of the "hello" custom,
and the insignia of "dinks," caps,
corduroys, and sombreros for the sev
eral classes.
"We have no athletic activities in
the summer in which new students
may participate," said Captain Jack
Patrick, of the 1921 football team. He
urged all interested in journalism to
try for the student paper, and those
looking forward to athletics to study
them, and to get their courses well
this summer.
The dependence of student govern
ment on the right student attitude was
explained by Paul Campbell. He out
lined the manner in which the govern
ing council functions. "Student con
trol is not a lisenee but a privilege,"
said Campbell, "and one of the most
vital the University affords its stu
dent members,"
Phil Richards indicated something
of the difficulty in the way of the
establishment of the student honor
system which was put into effect last
quarter, and he pointed out some of
the problems of its success during the
summer quarter, with the large pro
portion of newcomers and students
perhaps not used to the privileges and
obligations of such an undertaking.
Leiser closed the assembly indi
cating that the students of the sum
mer quarter may prove for all time
that Stanford can work an honor sys
tem, with all the assentials for which
it stands. He voiced the hope that the
new students get together with the
old in making the present quarter as
pleasant and worthwhile as possible.
