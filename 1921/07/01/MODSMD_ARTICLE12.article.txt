# INTRAMURAL SPORTS ATTRACT LARGE LIST TO SUMMER SERIES
## 
### 
Intramural sports promise to hold
greater interest on the campus this
summer than during any previous sum
mer quarter, as a large number of
students have already signed up in
the tennis and handball tournaments
which will begin tomorrow afternoon.
An unusual number of men have
been out practicing regularly for the
singles and doubles tennis tourna
ments, and from the showing made
thus far the students may well expect
some interesting matches before the
quarter ends.
The handball courts in Eencina Gym
have been kept busy about as much
as during the spring quarter, despite
the fact that there are less than half
the number of students here to use
them. Director A. D. Browne and
Coaches C. S. Botsford, Harry Maloney
and Duffy Seay, are doing remark
ably clever playing, and Maloney,
whose army experiences crop out in
his speech now and then, says "the
team that takes us into camp will
have to get up a long time before
reveille."
