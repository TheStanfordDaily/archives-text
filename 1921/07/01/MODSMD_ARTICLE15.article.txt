# PALO ALTO CHURCHES HOLD OPEN HOUSES
## 
### 
The Palo Alto churches, in connec
tion with the Epworth League,
held an open house, last night, at 6:30,
at which refreshment were served,
in their several places of meeting. The
function was in the nature of a
welcome to all new and returning
students and every church in Palo
Alto will be opened to greet the new
men and women of their faith. The
get-together started at 6:30 in order
to allow the students to get back to
their studies in good time.
