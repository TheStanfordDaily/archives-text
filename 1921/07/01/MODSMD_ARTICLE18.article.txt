# UNIVERSAL INDORSEMENT
## 
### 
The General Education Board recently gave to Stanford $300,000
with tjie provision that this University should itself raise $700,000 toward
r $1,000,000 endowment for the increasing l of professors' salaries at
Stanford. The grant was made after a thorough study of the aims and
capabilities of Stanford, and comes as a distinct commendation and rec
ognition of Stanford's place as a university of the highest character.
The extraordinarily large proportion of the total amount furnished by
the Board is an added compliment to the quality and work of the Stan
ford faculty and administration.
This action of the General Education Board is significant in that
Stanford of all the universities in the United States is so favored. Com
ing as it does following the action of the Carnegie Corporation in pick
ing Stanford as the best fitted of all universities for the establishment
of a food research institute, with an accompanying $700,000 endow
ment for the purpose, the action of the General Board has added sig
nificance. Either of these two actions would have given an unlimited
advance to the prestige of any university in the world. The two coming
to Stanford have a meaning that the ordinary student will have some
difficulty in comprehending. Greater universal recognition is seldom if
ever given any university.
The raising of the $700,000 of the professors' salaries endowment
is another problem for the administration, in whose ability we have every
confidence, though the problem is admittedly difficult. As a public insti
tution Stanford will probably obtain most of it from outside public
sources.
