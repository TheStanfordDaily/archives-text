# SOPHOMORE CLASS WILL ORGANIZE FOR SUMMER QUARTER
## 
### 
At an unofficial meeting of the soph
omore class yesterday it was decided
tthat in view of the abnormal condi
tions of the campus this quarter it
would be well to organize. The mo
tion was carried to request Alice
Roth as vice-president of the class of
'22, to call another meeting for next
Tuesday in Room 214, at 12:45, for
the purpose of appointing a summer
chairman, or whatever other form of
government seems best adapted to the
purpose.
A suggestion was made to the ef
fect that a dance might be profitable
and feasible. Due to the informality
of the meeting, not much business
passed further than the discussion
stage, but it is expected that the
next meeting will clear up all the un
finished business. The women are in
vited to be present.
