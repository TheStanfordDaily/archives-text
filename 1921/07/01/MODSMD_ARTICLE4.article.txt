# "They Can Get Us Sore But We Won't Scab," Say Workers
##

Open hosiery; open minds; open
arms for any of President Wilbur's
four essentials by which we live, love,
et cetera, and open anything else can
be had on the Farm, as far as the
Building Trades Unions are concern
ed, except open shop, and unless the
contractors can have that, and quick
ly, the chances for the Commons din
ing-room, furnishing any food for
hungry, open mouths, next fall, seem
pretty slim.
About three weeks ago the contract
ors' association reduced wages, with
out turmoil from the union, and on
top of it piled an attempt to institute
an open shop, with the result that the
mechanics belonging to unions walked
out of their jobs all over the vicin
ity. The construction of the large
number of buildings which are being
erected all over the bay district, have
been held up and a large number of
mechanics locked-out of the work as a
result.
One hundred and eighty-six men
employed in the construction of the
Commons and Basketball Pavilion left
work at the beginning of the strike,
and, at the rate negotiations are pro
ceeding, may not return for some
time. Until the strike is settled the
construction will be suspended, as
not enough independent labor is avail
able to continue the work.
