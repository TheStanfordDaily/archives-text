# CHAMPIONSHIP IS DELAYED IN EAST BY HEAVY RAINFALL
## Neer's Match Against Bastain for Final Frame Postponed a Day Because of Wetness 
### 
Rainfall during most of the day
made it impossible to continue the
intercollegiate lawn tennis champion
ship matches at Haverford, yesterday.
Captain Neer. who is matched in the
semi-finals against Bastain, of the Uni
versity of Indiana, was not able to
play the match off until today.
Neer defeated Bates of California,
several days ago. thereby winning his
chance at the semi-finals. Fiebleman,
of Harvard, showed rather feebly in
the next frame and Neer eliminated
him in two straight sets. 6-2, and 6-3.
This victory put him in the semi-finals
against Bastain, who he will play to
day if the weather is fair.
Davies lost his place in the race
to Fenne, captain of the Harvard
squad. Davies' playing was far below
his usual form. He lost many points
in the net and failed, on the whole,
to rally at the critical time. His one
big spurt was in the eighth game of
the first set when te took the game
and two more from the score of 15-40.
A double fault at an unopportune time
lost the set and Davies never came
back.
Both the California captain and his
team-mate, Levy, were put out of the
running before Davies lost. Drum
wright, of Texas, who played Fenne
of Harvard, today, in the semi-finals,
side-tracked Levy, and Wednesday,
Neer, the Cardinal captain, defeated
the Blue and Gold leader, Bates.
Because of the postponement of the
tournament it is feared that the finals
will not have been played before the
arrival of the Oxford-Cambridge team
tomorrow afternoon and consequently,
the best men will not be known for
matching against the Englishmen.
