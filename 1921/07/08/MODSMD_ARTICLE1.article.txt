# CHARLES TURRILL TELLS OF EARLY CALIFORNIA DAYS
## Collection of Slides Shows Scenes of Pioneer Life and Action During Gold Rush 
### Walter Warren, '22 
"Californians are proud of their
state, but too often that pride is based
on superficial sectional feeling, and
not on a real knowledge of the history
of this wonderful area," declared
Charles B. Turrill in his lecture on
the Gold Days in California, in the
Little Theater, Tuesday night.
Mr. Turrill, who is a native Cali
fornia, and just four years younger
than the State, was intimately associ
ated with Governor Stanford in the
building of the Central Pacific trans
continental railroad. He has made a
thorough study of the early days of
California, from the time when the
Territory extended from the Pacific to
the Rockies, including what is now
Arizona, New Mexico. Colorado and
Nevada, down to the presentt time.
His collection of slides is remark
able in that the pictures are taken
from drawings, paintings and daguer
rotypes made in the period of which
they tell. They preserve the atmos
phere of the time and give an accu
racy of detail which is not found in
later pictures.
Mr. Turrill traced the development
of law from the wild days when the
immigrants were all young men, hardy
and untutored, remarkably honest,
hardly needing any law; to the forma
tion of the permanent civic govern
ments at Sacramento, San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
His pictures included drawings of
the early conditions and modes of liv
ing in Yerba Buena, later San Fran
cisco. and other sections of the State.
These pictures refute many of the com
mon legends about the early days,
showing the correct representation of
the clothes worn, methods of transport
and methods of mining.
All the devices for collecttitng the
valuable "dirt," from the primitive
wooden pan to the hydraulic stream,
a California invention, were shown.
Slides of the Mormon and Chinese
camps in early California were used,
and Mr. Turrill explained the work
and influence of-these peoples. The
Chinese follwed the trails of the
Americans and worked abandoned
mines, often making richer strikes
than the original workers.
One picture called forth the interest
ing story of "Dorsey," the only official
canine letter carrier ever used in the
United States Mail Service. Dorsey
made his five-mile trip regularly every
day, carrying letters to the miners in
a specially prepared pouch strapped
over his shoulders.
The Wells Fargo Express Company
was usually the most dependable mail
carrier among the outposts, said Mr.
Turrill. This company established a
reputation for reliability that exceeded
that of the Government. Several pic
tures showed the system of Pony Ex
press riders.
Many of the slides were taken by
the famous photographer of the early
days of the gold rush, Charles E. Wat
kins.

"Californians are proud of their
state, but too often that pride is based
on superficial sectional feeling, and
not on a real knowledge of the history
of this wonderful area," declared
Charles B. Turrill in his lecture on
the Gold Days in California, in the
Little Theater, Tuesday night.
Mr. Turrill, who is a native Cali
fornia, and just four years younger
than the State, was intimately associ
ated with Governor Stanford in the
building of the Central Pacific trans
continental railroad. He has made a
thorough study of the early days of
California, from the time when the
Territory extended from the Pacific to
the Rockies, including what is now
Arizona, New Mexico. Colorado and
Nevada, down to the presentt time.
His collection of slides is remark
able in that the pictures are taken
from drawings, paintings and daguer
rotypes made in the period of which
they tell. They preserve the atmos
phere of the time and give an accu
racy of detail which is not found in
later pictures.
Mr. Turrill traced the development
of law from the wild days when the
immigrants were all young men, hardy
and untutored, remarkably honest,
hardly needing any law; to the forma
tion of the permanent civic govern
ments at Sacramento, San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
His pictures included drawings of
the early conditions and modes of liv
ing in Yerba Buena, later San Fran
cisco. and other sections of the State.
These pictures refute many of the com
mon legends about the early days,
showing the correct representation of
the clothes worn, methods of transport
and methods of mining.
All the devices for collecttitng the
valuable "dirt," from the primitive
wooden pan to the hydraulic stream,
a California invention, were shown.
Slides of the Mormon and Chinese
camps in early California were used,
and Mr. Turrill explained the work
and influence of-these peoples. The
Chinese follwed the trails of the
Americans and worked abandoned
mines, often making richer strikes
than the original workers.
One picture called forth the interest
ing story of "Dorsey," the only official
canine letter carrier ever used in the
United States Mail Service. Dorsey
made his five-mile trip regularly every
day, carrying letters to the miners in
a specially prepared pouch strapped
over his shoulders.
The Wells Fargo Express Company
was usually the most dependable mail
carrier among the outposts, said Mr.
Turrill. This company established a
reputation for reliability that exceeded
that of the Government. Several pic
tures showed the system of Pony Ex
press riders.
Many of the slides were taken by
the famous photographer of the early
