# Probation Claims 268 After Spring Finals; Only 45 Disqualified
## 
### 
Five hundred and forty-nine alumni
—400 men and 149 women —are out in
the world today, proud of their
achievements in obtaining degrees at
Stanford. This particular number re
fers to the members of the group that
took part in the Commencement Ex
ercires in June.
Among the 549, 415 received A. B.
degrees; nine LL. D.; 65, A.M.,; 16
Engineers; 22, J. D.; 17, M. D„ and
five Ph. D.
The class, containing many "after
the war" students, was larger, by 75,
than any of previous years. But, at
the same time, some members of the
classes yet to be graduated were more
unfortunate. Forty-five, according to
information compiled this week, were
"disqualified," and went the way of
"flunk-outs."
Also, 268 went on probation during
the spring quarter—a condition which
obtained for the last time. These stu
dents have opportunity, during the
summer (those who are here, to re
establish themselves as fully qualified
students of the University, and those
who return in October may take the
autumn quarter for the same purpose.
Tehereafter, with the now "no pro
bation" regulations in effect, all ill
omened notices will bear advices of
disqualification for further attend
ance, only.
