# BLEACHERS FALL AS STADIUM FILL RISES AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
## Work Progresses Rapidly in Building Big Bowl For the Autumn Game With U. C. 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
Work has been started on the tear
ing down of the old i'ootball bleachers
which will be supplanted by the Stadi
um, which is now one day ahead of
construction schedule, and which will
be easily ready for the Big Game. The
old lumber is being saved and is to be
used in the construction of the new
bowl, only enough of the old stands
being saved to care for the attend
ance at preliminary games.
The turf which is now on the old
Stadium Site
Surrounded by Fill
playing field is to be transferred to
the stadium later on. It is expected
that the students will will do most of
this work.
The oval is nearly entirely sur
rounded by a ten-foot fill which will
rise thirty feet more by the time the
Big Game is called. The appear
ance of the bowl is easily imaginable,
with its tiers fo seats stretching back
from the field, three times the dist
ance the present bleachers do, the
football field and cinder track, the
auto park and the large crowd cheering
the triumphant Cardinal which the
6tadium will accommodate. That the
bowl will be the first in the west is
assured and that it will be the best
in the west will be evident by com
parison.
At present there are seventy men
at work with the mule teams, tract
ors, and graders. There are 120 head
of mules and horses iiauling the
wagons which carry the dirt to the
side of the field. Three of the newest
type of elevating graders are being
used to scoop up the soil and another
one is ready for use as soon as the
tractor equipment arrives. These
graders are pulled by sixty horse
power tractors, and it is estimated
that 2500 cubic yards of earth is re
moved every day with this equipment.
After scooping up the dirt with a
plow attachment, the graders, by
means of an endless belt running on
a wide arm reaching out to the side,
pour a continual stream of dirt into
