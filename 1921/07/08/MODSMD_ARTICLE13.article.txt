# BLEACHERS FALL AS STADIUM FILL RISES AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
## Work Progresses Rapidly in Building Big Bowl For the Autumn Game With U. C. 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
Work has been started on the tear
ing down of the old i'ootball bleachers
which will be supplanted by the Stadi
um, which is now one day ahead of
construction schedule, and which will
be easily ready for the Big Game. The
old lumber is being saved and is to be
used in the construction of the new
bowl, only enough of the old stands
being saved to care for the attend
ance at preliminary games.
The turf which is now on the old
Stadium Site
Surrounded by Fill
playing field is to be transferred to
the stadium later on. It is expected
that the students will will do most of
this work.
The oval is nearly entirely sur
rounded by a ten-foot fill which will
rise thirty feet more by the time the
Big Game is called. The appear
ance of the bowl is easily imaginable,
with its tiers fo seats stretching back
from the field, three times the dist
ance the present bleachers do, the
football field and cinder track, the
auto park and the large crowd cheering
the triumphant Cardinal which the
6tadium will accommodate. That the
bowl will be the first in the west is
assured and that it will be the best
in the west will be evident by com
parison.
At present there are seventy men
at work with the mule teams, tract
ors, and graders. There are 120 head
of mules and horses iiauling the
wagons which carry the dirt to the
side of the field. Three of the newest
type of elevating graders are being
used to scoop up the soil and another
one is ready for use as soon as the
tractor equipment arrives. These
graders are pulled by sixty horse
power tractors, and it is estimated
that 2500 cubic yards of earth is re
moved every day with this equipment.
After scooping up the dirt with a
plow attachment, the graders, by
means of an endless belt running on
a wide arm reaching out to the side,
pour a continual stream of dirt into
each wagon that keeps pace along
side, until filled.
The beginnings of what will be the
huge thirty-six-foot embankments have
already been made, and there is a
straight wall of earth ten feet high
strung out along the edge of the field.
The fill was started only after the
surface loam had been piled farther
back, to be saved for making the play
ing surface of the gridiron. It is a
fairly simple master now for the teams
to haul the dirt to the top of the em
bankment, but by the time the grad
ers have excavated to a depth of
twenty-three feet, the job should be
a picturesque one to watch.
When completed, the stadium will
seat 60,000 people, and the problem
of caring for the crowds will be well
worked out. All the entrances will be
from the outside with stairs leading
up to the top of the tiers of seats.
Parking spaces for the thousands of
automobiles that will come, will be
cleared between the stadium and the
highway. Some idea of the range of
territory covered by the stand is
shown by the fact that the distance
of the nearest seat from the center
of the field will be 173 feet, and that
of the farthest, 415 feet. Extensive
concrete work which will later on give
the stadium its permanence will not
be attempted this year, in order to
complete preparations for the Big
Came, the only Avork of that kind will
be some concrete seat foundations.
I The opening of the stadium is ex
pected to mark a new era in the ath
letic history of Stanford. Besides the
increased activities made possible by
the money taken in, there is the pros
pect of having the new field the scene
of many activities of nation-wide im
portance. The big East-and-West
game would find a logical setting in
this new athletic arena, and the
chances for making this stadium, the
biggest in the west, the place of com
petition for many other football, track
and field events will undoubtedly be
favorable.
