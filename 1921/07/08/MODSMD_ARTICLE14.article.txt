### 
Professor A. M. Cathcart was re

mayor expressed his appreciation of
the honor and thanked the council for
their assistance and courtesies during
the term which just expired. He said
that to be executive head of Palo Alto
was more pleasing to him than to be
mayor of the largest city in the coun
try.
Professor Cathcart is acting head of
