# Stanford Graduates in Palo Alto Will Meet at Community House Monday
## 
### 
All Stanford alumni and former
students of the university who are
residents of Palo Alto and vicinity
are invited to attend a meeting in the
Community House at 8 o'clock, next
Monday night, when first steps toward
forming a Palo Alto-Stanford Club will
be taken.
With Stanford clubs existing in
many cities throughout the United
States, it is stated by proponents of
the local plan that the city which
is the seat of the university should
have one of the livest clubs in the
whole chain.
It is estimated that there are about
400 men and women here eligible for
membership.
