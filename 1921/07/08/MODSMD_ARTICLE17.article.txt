# A
						"REGULAR" QUARTER
## 
### 
About one thousand men and women make up the student enroll
ment of the summer quarter,'almost half as many as will be registered
in the fall. Although this quarter is sometimes said not to be "regular,"
in many respects it is more "regular" than the other three. Students
who spend vacations in study do so because they are concerned directly
with what they can get from their cources. Classes in general are some
what smaller, and a closer contact with professors is possible.
Hut since there is little student activity, the quarter can not be to
many old-timers a "regular" one. This is no reason for not making it
as "regular" as possible. Many students here for the first time are look
ing forward to the fall, and should be interested in getting a good start.
Those who are here even for the first and only time will always say they
have attended Stanford, and should know as much of Stanford as pos
sible. Though there is little regular activity it is possible for the stu
dents of the summer quarter to get together and promote certain things
that will make for a more worthwhile present quarter.
Among other things, Stanford men always speak to each other on
the campus, or wherever they are recognized, and there is no reason
why everyone now attending the University should not get into the
habit. Observance of other customs and traditions should be followed
by all who are now on the campus.
There is apparently little use for class organizations, or class activ
ity. But the student body might well give one or two real jolly-ups or
associated student dances which all might attend. Possibly a few of the
dramatic artists could get together and plan some sort of a student
vaudeville program.
The quarter may be well made "regular many ways, and willing
persons can aid in making it as pleasant as possible.
