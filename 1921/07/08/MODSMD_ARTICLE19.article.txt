### 
A statement from the office of Sec
retary Morgan of the Y. M. C. A. out
lines the activity of the organization
for the past year:
"One thousand Freshman Handbooks
were distributed to men and women.
Campus guides helped new students
get settled. Incomplete Membership
canvass brought over 325. World
t'joblems Forums have aggregated
If-GO attendance The largest delega
tior. ever sent from Stanford enjoyed
a wonderful holiday conference at
Aeilomar, at which several of our men
dci ided for Chriu.'a.i life work. A
Filipino Club foster-'<l by the Y has
scoured a $6000 club house. A Mis
s'onary Band of fifteen is flourishing,
l ive Freshman Assemblies arranged
in co-operation wi ;n the Student Body
aggregated 2500 in attendance.
btudents are aided by small short
time loans. Sherwood Eddy, Sam Hig
g'.nbottom, and H. B. Sweet addressed
assemblies and other meetings and
made deep impressions. Fully 100
men have worked on committees.
Cordial co-operation with the Chap
lain helps increase daily Chapel and
Church attendance. Nine boys' clubs
arc led by our members. Deputations
to nearby towns and high schools, en
couraged clean ljving and high think
ing, and preached Stanford on the
side. Five student Bible classes have
continued through the year.
Quantities of used clothes were col
lected for the Red Cross at the Base
Hospital, and for the Armenians. Hos
pital visitation is a growing and kindly
service. Foreign students are helped
to learn our Christian and democratic
ideals, and feel our fraternal interest.
Students have subscribed nearly
$600 to the local work, and over $500
to the "Stanford in China" fund. Five
students are at work with seventy-five
Mexican children at Redwood City.
Dr. Kenneth J. Saunders gave six re
markable addresses on "East and
West â€”International Problems." An
envelope and sheet of paper were
sent 1800 men with the suggestion
that they write home on Mother's Day.
Seven thousand letter-heads were
used in the office the past year, and
nearly as many envelopes.
The work has grown so rapidly that
additional help is absolutely necessary.
A full time assistant secretary will
serve September 15, 1921 to June 5,
1922.
Is there a more important work for
civilization than to generate in our
coming leaders the spirit of Idealism
and of Service?
