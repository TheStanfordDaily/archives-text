### 
By winning the final match of the
intercollegiate championship tourney
From Fenno, of Harvard, at Haver
ford, Pa., Phil Neer, Cardinal tennis

ing the title to Stanford. The match
went the full five sets, Fenno taking
the first and fourth. The score was

playing winning for him in the end.
Neer will continue as captain of the
tennis varsity during 1922, the position
which he held last season. Re-elected
unanimously, he was accorded the un
usual honor in recognition of his hard
work in reorganizing tennis after the
war, and making it a major sport, as
well as for his ability. Neer was a
member of the basketball squad last
year and played on his freshman ten
nis and basketball teams. He is a
member of Alpha Delta Phi.
Elected to the presidency of the
National Intercollegiate Lawn Tennis
Association, Neer is the first man com
ing from a college, west of Princeton,
ever to be chosen for the post.
Defeating Fenno, Neer obtained
partial revenge for the elimination of
his team-mate, Davies, who was put
out of the race by the Harvard cap
tain in the round before the semi
finals. Bates, the Blue and Gold cap
tain, was beaten by Neer at the same
time and Levy, California's other man,
had been eliminated even before this.
Fiebleman and Fenno, who won the
double championship for Harvard by
defeating Levy and Bates of California,
eliminated the Stanford team in the
fourth round of the tournament. Neer
and Davies had things their own way
the first set but lost the match with
the two last. The score was 4-6, 6-2,
and 6-3.
The team will continue the tour play
ing Harvard and Yale before returning
west.
