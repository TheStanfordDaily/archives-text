# "LEAGUE IS HERE TO STAY" STATES GOVERNMENT MAN
## A. N. Holcombe, Professor of Government at Harvard, Speaks on Tax Statistics 
### Walt Warren, '22 
"The average American is an ideal
ist, and his idealism is to put to the
test during the next two years," de
clared Professor Arthur N. Holcombe,
in his address on "Human Nature and
the Income Tax," in the Little Theater,
Tuesday evening. Holcombe is Pro
fessor of Government at Harvard, and
a member of the Stanford Summer
Faculty.
"The thing that is going to test the
average man is this: Will he hold the
present administration to its promise
to form an "association of nations"?
asserted Holcombe. "Those who judge
the average man by material standards
only, and say that his only interest is
material comfort, do not know him.
"The statement of an American am

by ideals, that she was not too proud
to fight, but too cowardly not to fight.

the nation. This may be a form of
treason not punishable by the laws of
the land, but it will find its retribu

are held to their pledge to enter an
association of nations, they must go

to Holcombe. He believes that the
League cannot be destroyed because
the small nations will not give up the
advantages they have gained through
the same.
"What are the prospects of the
United States staying out of the
League? It is composed of fifty na
tions. Can United States breat it up?
Some say 'Yes,' because all the world
is indebted to her.
"But let us consider what the League
means to other nations. Take Holland
for example. Before the war Holland
was spending millions building battle
ships for the protection of Java and
her colonial possessions. Now Hol
land does not need a navy to protect
her outposts. She will not let this
opportunity slip."
Holcombe then gave other examples
of concrete gains of individual nations
through entering the League, and
pointed out the fight they will put up
before they will allow the League to
