# "LEAGUE IS HERE TO STAY" STATES GOVERNMENT MAN
## A. N. Holcombe, Professor of Government at Harvard, Speaks on Tax Statistics 
### Walt Warren, '22 
"The average American is an ideal
ist, and his idealism is to put to the
test during the next two years," de
clared Professor Arthur N. Holcombe,
in his address on "Human Nature and
the Income Tax," in the Little Theater,
Tuesday evening. Holcombe is Pro
fessor of Government at Harvard, and
a member of the Stanford Summer
Faculty.
"The thing that is going to test the
average man is this: Will he hold the
present administration to its promise
to form an "association of nations"?
asserted Holcombe. "Those who judge
the average man by material standards
only, and say that his only interest is
material comfort, do not know him.
"The statement of an American am
bassador recently made in another
country, explaining why America enter
ed the war, does not represent the
average man. The statement said in
effect that America was not prompted
by ideals, that she was not too proud
to fight, but too cowardly not to fight.
"He besmirched the fair name of
America, and betrayed the honor of
the nation. This may be a form of
treason not punishable by the laws of
the land, but it will find its retribu
tion at the bar of public opinion."
If the present leaders of America
are held to their pledge to enter an
association of nations, they must go
into the League of Nations, according
to Holcombe. He believes that the
League cannot be destroyed because
the small nations will not give up the
advantages they have gained through
the same.
"What are the prospects of the
United States staying out of the
League? It is composed of fifty na
tions. Can United States breat it up?
Some say 'Yes,' because all the world
is indebted to her.
"But let us consider what the League
means to other nations. Take Holland
for example. Before the war Holland
was spending millions building battle
ships for the protection of Java and
her colonial possessions. Now Hol
land does not need a navy to protect
her outposts. She will not let this
opportunity slip."
Holcombe then gave other examples
of concrete gains of individual nations
through entering the League, and
pointed out the fight they will put up
before they will allow the League to
go to pieces.
"The majority will never give up the
vast advantages they have gained,"
said Holcombe. "They could not with
draw within two years without break
ing their word of honor, and the na
tions are going to he slow to do that
after the lesson of the World War."
"In the meantime the President must
make good his pledge, and the average
man must hold him to the pledge. If
the United States cannot break up the
League, then she must go into it.
Herbert Hoover is a Stanford man
who believes that the ideas of the
l eague are practical."
The early part of the address was
given to relating amiuing sidelights
on human nature as revealed by Pro
fessor Holcomble's work in connection
with the Income Tax. He war. Assist
ant Commissioner of Internal Revenue
for a few years after the adoption of
the income tax, and had access to
figures and facts of a very interesting
nature.
"Few people are content to let their
neighbors know exactly what their
income is," said Hoieombo. "Most
people like their neighbors to tliiak
they make more than they do. A few
wiser ones like to have them think
they make less than they really do,
and very few are anxious to have their
exact income known. So most people
are curious about their neighbors. I
looked mine up, but my oath of office
will not allow me to tell anything I
learned by it, and what's the good of
knowing if you can't tell it?"
Holcombe classified the men of
America in three groups, the rich, the
near rich, and the average man. The
rich —those who pay taxes on $5,000
income or more —make up one and
two-thirds per cent of the men. The
near rich —those who pay taxes of
$2,000 —are about eight per cent. The
average man, who gets from $1400 to
$1500 a year, numbers about ninety
per cent. However, there is no aver
age man, for according to Holcombe
the average man has a wife and two
and two-thirds children.

tions. Can United States breat it up?
Some say 'Yes,' because all the world
is indebted to her.
"But let us consider what the League
means to other nations. Take Holland
for example. Before the war Holland
was spending millions building battle
ships for the protection of Java and
her colonial possessions. Now Hol
land does not need a navy to protect
her outposts. She will not let this
opportunity slip."
Holcombe then gave other examples
of concrete gains of individual nations
through entering the League, and
pointed out the fight they will put up
before they will allow the League to
go to pieces.
"The majority will never give up the
vast advantages they have gained,"
said Holcombe. "They could not with
draw within two years without break
ing their word of honor, and the na
tions are going to he slow to do that
after the lesson of the World War."
"In the meantime the President must
make good his pledge, and the average
man must hold him to the pledge. If
the United States cannot break up the
League, then she must go into it.
Herbert Hoover is a Stanford man
who believes that the ideas of the

The early part of the address was
given to relating amiuing sidelights
on human nature as revealed by Pro
fessor Holcomble's work in connection
with the Income Tax. He war. Assist
ant Commissioner of Internal Revenue
for a few years after the adoption of
the income tax, and had access to
figures and facts of a very interesting
nature.
"Few people are content to let their
neighbors know exactly what their
income is," said Hoieombo. "Most
people like their neighbors to tliiak
they make more than they do. A few
wiser ones like to have them think
they make less than they really do,
and very few are anxious to have their
exact income known. So most people
are curious about their neighbors. I
looked mine up, but my oath of office
will not allow me to tell anything I
learned by it, and what's the good of
knowing if you can't tell it?"
Holcombe classified the men of
America in three groups, the rich, the
near rich, and the average man. The
rich —those who pay taxes on $5,000
income or more —make up one and
two-thirds per cent of the men. The
near rich —those who pay taxes of
$2,000 —are about eight per cent. The
average man, who gets from $1400 to
$1500 a year, numbers about ninety
per cent. However, there is no aver
age man, for according to Holcombe
the average man has a wife and two
and two-thirds children.
"The average American is an ideal
ist, and his idealism is to put to the
test during the next two years," de
clared Professor Arthur N. Holcombe,
in his address on "Human Nature and
the Income Tax," in the Little Theater,
Tuesday evening. Holcombe is Pro
fessor of Government at Harvard, and
a member of the Stanford Summer
Faculty.
"The thing that is going to test the
average man is this: Will he hold the
present administration to its promise
to form an "association of nations"?
asserted Holcombe. "Those who judge
the average man by material standards
only, and say that his only interest is
material comfort, do not know him.
"The statement of an American am
bassador recently made in another
country, explaining why America enter
ed the war, does not represent the
average man. The statement said in
effect that America was not prompted
by ideals, that she was not too proud
to fight, but too cowardly not to fight.
"He besmirched the fair name of
America, and betrayed the honor of
the nation. This may be a form of
treason not punishable by the laws of
the land, but it will find its retribu
tion at the bar of public opinion."
If the present leaders of America
are held to their pledge to enter an
association of nations, they must go
into the League of Nations, according
to Holcombe. He believes that the
League cannot be destroyed because
the small nations will not give up the
advantages they have gained through
the same.
"What are the prospects of the
United States staying out of the
League? It is composed of fifty na
tions. Can United States breat it up?
Some say 'Yes,' because all the world
