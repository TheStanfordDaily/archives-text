# COACH VAN GENT
## 
### 
Gene Van Gent comes to Stanford with a significant record, not a
phenomenal one perhaps, but one the circumstances of which indicate
that the new coach knows the strategy of football. He understands the
game as a science, and those who know his work believe him one of the
most capable in imparting his knowledge and understanding of the game
to the players.
Van Gent is coming back to football after a year's work in other
fields because he likes the game, and because he believes in the prowess
of Stanford. He is tall, sturdy, and well built, and the players who have
met him are strong and outspoken in their statements of confidence in
his power to make the 1 ( )21 football season what it should be.
The understanding of the gridiron game and ability to direct the
fall squad are what Stanford desires without question. But the best
attribute of Coach Van Gent is his understanding of the Stanford sit
uation, and his thorough agreement with Captain Jack Patrick that there
hasn't yet been developed an unbeatable football team.
