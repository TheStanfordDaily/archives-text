# FOR NEW STUDENTS

An opportunity of hearing Dr. Jordan is one of the privileges seldom
awarded students of the summer quarter. Reminiscences of Stanford's
first president, who built the University with the Stanfords, and who
watched over the Hoovers, the Irwins, and other "old-timer" students
develop many of the traditions we now treasure so highly, become more
interesting to Stanford students as they continue their University life.
The assembly Wednesday evening is primarily for freshmen and new
students, however, and older men are asked to allow those who have
not heard Dr. Jordan first place in the Little Theatre.
There is no better way to become acquainted with the ideals and
traditions of Stanford than from Dr. Jordan.

THE DAILY ANNOUNCES the appointment to the staff of A. R
Boone '24, R. 1). Boynton '25, J. L. Leonard 25, L. David 25, and W
N. Morris '25.
