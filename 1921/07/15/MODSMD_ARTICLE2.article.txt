The Veiled Lady (?) (?)
The trouble all starts by the usual
method, a falsehood. It's all Jack's fault.
If he had told who it was that he was
with on the all-night ferris wheel ride
the-re might have been a quiet divorce
and the lawyers would have been the
richer, but he didn't, and three acts is
the result. The wife sends a telegram
to John Brown, who he is presumably
with, but isn't, and Jack, finding it out,
presses Frank Fuller into service to fix
things up. Of course, John Brown shows
up and the tangle, develops into a snarl.
However .it gains the "lived happily ever
after" finis when the lady is unveiled
and found to be—worth the price of ad
mission to see.
Tickets will be placed on sale in the
near future.
