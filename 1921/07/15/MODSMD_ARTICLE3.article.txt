# Y. M. C. A. CONDUCTS DRIVE FOR MEMBERS
## 
### 
Although there was a good showing
the first Sunday, the attendance last
Sunday was so small it lias been decided
to give up the Y. M. C. A. discussion
groups. There has been a drive among
the freshmen to get as many newcomers
into the Stanford Y. M. C. A. as pos
sible- Any one interested should see F.
E. Morgan, the Stanford secretary, in
the Union. There are no dues, and
members have visiting privileges in other
cities.
