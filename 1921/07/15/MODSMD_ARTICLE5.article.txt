# Tossing Tourney Tosses Title to Tannenham Two

" 'Sail right, Georges, never mind, you
aren't the only challenger who has had
tossed 'Iron Mike' around him. Look at
Botsford and Robinson, f'rinstance.
They were gonna take on the whole
Univ. for a quart a match, a quart of
Velvetâ€”they advertise, when kindly
Providence intervened and confused
their irons, thereby saving them from
the rigors of a Colfax recuperation."
The big horseshoe tournament lost its
initiators last Monday, when Tannen
ham and Benter snatched, or rather
rung, the collegiate tossing title from the
defying Botsford and Robinson. The
winners, training for a full fifteen min
utes before the competition, with appar
ent ease garnered the ice cream and
offered the same conditions to anyone
who cared to dispute their title.
