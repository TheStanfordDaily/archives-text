# BERKELEY PLAYERS TO PRESENT WILDE PLAY NEXT TUESDAY
## Cast of 'Importance of Being Earnest' Includes Gordon Davis in Role of Merriman 
### 
Dramatic Coach Gordon Davis will
appear with the Greek Theater Players
as "Merriman" in the Oscar Wilde
coemdy, "The Importance of Being
Earnest," next Tuesday evening in the
Assembly Hall. As before, the Berkeley
company is sponsored by the Renaissance
Club, and arrangements for the presen
tation of this production are. under the
direction of B. Carroll Alexander and
Darl Macßoyle, who have announced the
seat sale to open today at the Adminis
tration Building and at Crandall's in
Palo Alto.
The personnel of the cast is almost the
same, as that of the cast of "Pygmalion,"
which was given here last quarter, in
cluding Irving Pichel and Sam Hume.
The summer organization of the Greek-
Theater Players is eccentric as it admits
outsiders. Coach Gordon Davis has
been with the organization since the be
ginning of the quarter, busy as associate
director and artist. Lester Sieb, '22, also
has a position on the staff of actors for
the summer, hut will not appear in this
play.
The cast is as follows:
John Worthing Irving Pichel
Algernon Moneliff Samuel J. Hume
Merriman Gordon Davis
Lane Morris Aikin
Lady Bracknell. Florence Locke
The Hon. Gwendolyn Fairfax
Richara Locke
Cycily Cargreen Emma Knox
Miss Prism Ve*i Morse
The play is considered one. of Oscar
Wilde's very hest, and was immensely
successful upon its lirst presentation in
Londo nin 1894. It played in His Majes
ty's Theater for two consecutive seasons
at that time. Wilde's conversation and
epigrams put this farcical flaying of
fashionable foibles far above even his
general run of comedies, in both wit
and situation.
Seats for "The Importance of Being
Earnest" will be obtainable at the Ad
ministration Building and Crandall's
after 10 a. m. from today until Monday.
In respect to the procuring of seats, Darl
Macßoyle, who is managing the produc
tion, said, "Students should procure
tickets early as many reservations will
doubtless be made by Palo Alto and San
jose people who will wish to take ad
vantage of this rare opportunity to see
Wilde played by the well known players
from Berkeley's famous Greek Theater."
