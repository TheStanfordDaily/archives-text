# POWERFUL TRACTORS PUSH BIG STADIUM EXCAVATION
## One-Third of Dirt Now Removed 
### A. R. Boone, '24 
Three ponderous, powerful tractors
roared in unison. They crawled slowly
around the outer edge of the bottom of
the big hole rapidly being made into
Stanford's Stadium, dumping yard after
yard of soft dirt into the trailing wagons.
With each successive journey around
the crater, another three lateral feet of
dirt had given way to the encroachments
of the man-made machines, and the
workers were another foot nearer the
bottom of what will be the 28-foot-deep
oval, and so much nearer completion of
the job scheduled to take 135 days from
last June 6.
Man-power, mule-power, automotive
power—these are the essential powers,
plus brains, money, and the enthusiastic
labors of Stanford men and women since
the inception of the Stadium idea, that
will put the big "dream" over. And
then—6o,ooo athletic fans will have op
portunity, in the new, spacious bleachers
to watch Cardinal warriors trample their
way down the field to victory.
Back to the Tractors;
They're Here at Work
But back to the three ponderous, pow
erful tractors. Today, they roared their
way, plowing steadily through the yield
ing earth. Three drivers, mounted in
pilots' seats, chauffeured their play
things, dexterously hugging the bank,
and biting large mouthfuls from the
mound that slopes to the center from all
sides.
At noon, the tractors were scattered
around the edge, approximately equi
distant one from the other. The whistle
blew. Teamsters, foremen and dump
men quit their tasks to make their way
toward the cook shack, where the noon
meal is served. But wagons were be
neath the rolling iron sheets that carry
the dirt into the air, then surreptitiously
dump it into the waiting "two-yarders."
The drivers halted, looked over their
loads and with one last effort compelled

the caterpillars to plow their way
through a few more yards of dirt.
And the excavation of the 230,000
yards of earth, necessary that the super
structural work might be installed, was
one-third completed!
Cynics Disappointed;
One-Third Dirt Moved
Work has been progressing rapidly
during these last days of sunshine. It
was thought when first the "hot spell"
struck the campus that men and teams
would be slowed down, that the plans
would be delayed rather than rushed
forward on schedule time. But the
cynics were disappointed.
Today, with the excavation one-third
completed and time for starting erection
of the bleachers only three weeks away,
the field workers are five days ahead of
the estimated schedule compiled by the
engineers—on the basis of 135 days from
last June 5. By dint of real effort, and
system of a superlative character, the
"ahead of schedule" has been accom
plished, and Foreman James Quaylc has
9,000 yards of "dump" to his crcdit that
can be stacked against a rainy day.
It is because man and beast have
moved with machine-like precision that
Quayle has found it possible to announce
progress more than satisfactory. One
hundred and seventy mules, dragging
scrapers (nine of them), and wagons
have furnished the motive power the
tractors lacked. Behind these mules, on
the work end of long, curling, blacksnake
whips, or pebbles and clods that are
kicked onto their seats by the animals'
heels, 80 men sit, and smoke, and fret—
and cuss.
Superman; It May
Be a Real Myth Yet
But their personal difficulties have not
stayed the real spirit they have shown
in putting the job over thus far. And
before football season is weJl under
way, the big turf-covered bowl will be
