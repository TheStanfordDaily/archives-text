# ENCINA FROSH CATCHES FAIRMONT HOTEL MUSIC ON BEDSPRINGR IN ROOM
## 
### 

The Fairmont Orchestra to put
him to sleep! No lowly ambitions
for this humble freshman of the
Encina, who refuses to be down-
hearted by the mysteries and
problems of University life. A
little lonely his first night on the
Campus, G. H. Dennis of Los
<ยง> Angeles digs out his wireless ap
paratus, hooks up on the bed
springs, and tunes up to catch the
music of the Fairmont Hotel Or-
chestra of San Francisco.
Upperclassmen passing by the
room heard the "peculiar vic-
trola" and entered the room,
to find it was the Fairmont or-
chestra entertaining.
