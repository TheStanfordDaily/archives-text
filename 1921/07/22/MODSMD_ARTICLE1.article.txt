The resignation of Edward R. Martin,

University, was accepted by the Board
of Athletic Control last night, and
William Fletcher, '11, was appointed

Martin's resignation was wholly un
expected inasmuch as he had already
been reappointed to and had tenta
tively accepted the post for the com
ing year. In accepting the resignation
the Board voiced regret that the man
ager found it necessary of leave
Stanford, and expressed a sincere ap
preciation of ',his work during -the
past year.

fame. He worked for three years
with the varsity squad never winning
as much as a third place. In his last
year he came out again, won first place
against the University of California,
and broke the coast record in the
mile.
Fletcher is an engineer. In the last
heart trouble, and has not followed
heart trouble, and hos not followed
his vocation. He lives in Palo Alto,
and through a close contact with the
University athletic situation, will be
able to assume the duties of the new
office immediately.
Martin is now in Southern California
handling the stadium campaign for
manager Joe Hickey there. He will
continue with the stadium work for
several weeks, when he will make his
home in Palo Alto.
