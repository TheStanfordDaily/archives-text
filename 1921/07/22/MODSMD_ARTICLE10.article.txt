# CONTRACTOR RENEWS WORK ON PAVILION
## 
### 
Constant additions are being made
to the morking force which is building
the new basketball pavilion, opposite
Encina Hall. While the present un
settled building conditions have made
it extremely hard to secure competent
workmen, the force on the building
has been increased to fifteen, and
there are prospects of having more
men 011 the job before the end of the
week.
The masons on the building have
been working steadily, and the walls
are growing in height each day. While
nothing definite can be predicted, it
is hoped that the building will be
fully ready for the opening of the
basketball season.
Interest in the progress of the
structure is keen, inasmuch as En
cina Gym in the past years has proven
entirely inadequate for inter-collegiate
contests.
