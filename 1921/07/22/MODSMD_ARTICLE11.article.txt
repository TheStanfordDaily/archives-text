# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS OF EARLY HISTORY TO SUMMER STUDENTS
## Helpfulness, Friendliness and Scholarship are Embodied in Stanford Spirit Says Speaker 
### 
"friendly, helpful, true." These are the three dominant characteristics of the
genuine Stanford stduent which are most vital to the University, as commended
by Dr. David Starr Jordan in his talk, given before a large audience at the Little
Theater on Wednesday evening. Though intended primarily as an address for
freshmen, many upperclassmen were gathered to hear the words of the first
president of the University.
Dr. Jordan told how, with the deatli of Leland Stanford Jr., Governor and
Mrs. Stanford resolved that the "children of California should be their children,"
with the result that Stanford University was founded, and dedicated with the
motto, '"1 lie Winds of Freedom Arc Blowing," a statement of the ever-liberal
spirit of truth and democracy that prevails at Stanford.

"It was not until after six years of
litigation that the University got the
thirty million dollars left it by the Stan
fords, When I wanted a new professor
I had to go out and find a horse," said
Dr. Jordan. "The horses were on the
grounds, so I thought that they must
belong to the University, and the price
of a horse would keep a professor
for some time, then.
"Stanford set out with no traditions,
and with everything pointing forward.
And so we are here to seek the truth,
not by the standards of our forefathers,
but as it is, as we see it for ourselves in
an atmosphere devoid of the narrowness
of party, of class, or creed. Therefore,"
continued Dr. Jordan, "the students of
Stanford are members of a great society.
You who now enter have received a
great privilege, both through the efforts
of those who made it possible for you to
attend this institution, and in part by
your own personal fitness for entrance.
St. Paul wrote that he 'was a citizen of
no mean city.' You, too, have become
citizens of no mean city.
Speaks of First
Freshmen Here
"Thirty years ago in this same hall, I
spoke to the first freshmen. Among
them was Herbert Hoover, who sat in
the front seat and actually believed what
I told him. Among the things I said
to them was, 'The world turns aside to
let any man pass who knows where he is
going.' It is true, for 'we must sail, and
not drift, nor lie. at anchor!' How can
the world help us, if we do not know
where we ourselves are heading?
"The whole of your own life must be
spent in your own company, and only an
educated man is Rood company to him
self.''
Then Dr. Jordan explained how the
elective system enables one to supply
himself with the intellectual garment to
lit him own particular needs, thus en
abling him to he good company for him
self.
Stanford Is For
Workers Only
"In a recent college publication," said
Dr. Jordan, "students were placed in
three groupsâ€”those who came here, to
have a good time, those who came to
definitely interest themselves in one par-,
ticular study, and those, who came that
they might learn how to deal with their
fellows. For the first group. Stanford
has never had any use. Stanford wants
for her students those who will learn
here to be either scholars or leaders."
As a preliminary to Dr. Jordan's dis
cussion, William Leiser, '21, spoke of
the honor system and urged the ul
most co-operation of the freshmen in
its observance.
Dr-. William M. Proctor of the School
of Education was the chairman of the
evening.
