# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS OF EARLY HISTORY TO SUMMER STUDENTS
## Helpfulness, Friendliness and Scholarship are Embodied in Stanford Spirit Says Speaker

"friendly, helpful, true." These are the three dominant characteristics of the
genuine Stanford stduent which are most vital to the University, as commended
by Dr. David Starr Jordan in his talk, given before a large audience at the Little
Theater on Wednesday evening. Though intended primarily as an address for
freshmen, many upperclassmen were gathered to hear the words of the first
president of the University.
Dr. Jordan told how, with the deatli of Leland Stanford Jr., Governor and
Mrs. Stanford resolved that the "children of California should be their children,"
with the result that Stanford University was founded, and dedicated with the
motto, '"1 lie Winds of Freedom Arc Blowing," a statement of the ever-liberal

You who now enter have received a
great privilege, both through the efforts
of those who made it possible for you to
attend this institution, and in part by
your own personal fitness for entrance.
St. Paul wrote that he 'was a citizen of
no mean city.' You, too, have become
citizens of no mean city.
Speaks of First
Freshmen Here
"Thirty years ago in this same hall, I
spoke to the first freshmen. Among
them was Herbert Hoover, who sat in
the front seat and actually believed what
I told him. Among the things I said
to them was, 'The world turns aside to
let any man pass who knows where he is
going.' It is true, for 'we must sail, and
not drift, nor lie. at anchor!' How can
the world help us, if we do not know

spent in your own company, and only an
