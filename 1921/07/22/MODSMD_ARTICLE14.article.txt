Dr. Jordan last night read his
"Call to Young Men," which he
first read shortly after coming to
Stanford, and which has since,
then gone around the world.
"Your first duty in life is to
wards your after self," it reads.
"So live that your afterself —
the man you ought to be —may
in his time be possible and
actual.
"Far away in the years he is
waiting his turn. His body, his
brain, his soul, are in your boy
ish hands. He cannot help him
self. What will you leave for
him?
"Will it be a brain unspoiled
by lust or dissipation; a mind
trained to think and act; a
nervous system as true as a dial
in its response to the truth
about you? Will you. Boy, let
trim come as a man among men
in his time? Or will you throw
away his inheritance before he
has had the chance to touch it?
Will you turn over to him a
brain distorted, a mind diseased;
a will untrained to action; a
spinal cord grown through and
through with the devil grass we
call wild oats? "Will you let
him come, taking your plac?,
gaining through your experi
ences, happv in your friendships,
lallowed through your joys,
building them on Iris own?
"Or will you fling it all away,
lecreeing, wanton-like, that the
oian you might have been shall
lever be?
"This i.3 your problem in life
—the problem vastly mere im
portant to you than any or nil
Dthers. How will you nqeet it,
is a man or as a fool? It is
pour problem today and every
lay, and th-3 hour of your de
cision is the crisis in your
lestiny."
