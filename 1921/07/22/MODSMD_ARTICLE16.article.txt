# THE
						RIGHT NAME

Archie Rice, '95. recently in a letter to the New York Herald pointed
ont that the official name of Stanford is Stanford University, and not any
of the several other combinations sometimes used. He indicated rather
forcefully to easterners that the somewhat favored "Leland Stanford' is
as incorrect as would be ''John Harvard" or "Ely Yale. '
It might be added that Stanford is a university, and not a "school,"
as undergraduates sometimes infer. To quote from a recent letter of a
San Francisco alumnus, "the undergraduates generally refer to the Uni
versity as a 'school.' This title seems, to have crept in in the last few
years, just when 1 do not know. I can not recall any undergraduate
referring to the University by any other term than 'University' during
my residence. I have been concurred with in this criticism by alumni
who have visited the campus recently."
It is hardly true that students generally use the word "school"
when speaking of Stanford, but it is true that this term is used altogether
too often. We do not hesitate to ask Easterners to use Stanford's correct
name when referring to this University, and it should not be too much to
ask of our own students to remember always that they are members of a
university, not a school.
