### 
lo the New York Herald: At the
approach into this section of Neer and
Davies, two undergraduates from Stan
ford University, making a four-month,
forty-tournament tennis tour of the
United States — and tints far with
straight collegiate victories—may I, on
behalf of the 470 Stanford men and
women residing in New York and the
immediate neighborhood of the metro
politan district, call attention to the fact
that although there are 22,000 Stanford
men and women scattered far all over
tlie world, nowhere is that university
called "Leland Stanford University" ex
cept in this somewhat restricted east
ern section of the continent of North
Ame.rica ?
The official foundation name was Le
land Stanford Junior University, in
memory of the only son of Leland Stan
ford, the founder, who did not name
the university for himself. In all the
thirty years of its existence, with ma
triculates from every state in the Union
and from every civilized country on
earth, Stanford never has been called
"Leland Stanford University" by any of
its students, alumni or faculty members.
Officially on its publications the title
simply is Stanford University.
To understand how the wrong name
seems, imagine Atlantic coast dwellers
arriving in San Francisco only to dis
cover that the newspapers there persist
ently used such phrases as "John Har
vard University," "Eli Yale University,"
"Ezra Cornell University."
Of the 470 Stanford men and women
in and about New York city forty-one
are college professors at Columbia, Vas
sar, Cornell, Syracuse, Rutgers; twenty
eight are editors of newspapers or are
professional writers; twenty-two are
doctors, three are. ministers, and petro
leum experts, mining and electrical en
gineers, lawyers and actors are repre
sented by more than a dozen each.
This back tide toward New York is
quite proper when it is considered that
both Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane
Lathrop Stanford, the founders, were
born at or within a few miles of Al
bany, and that Stanford's president for
the first twenty years was a member of
Cornell's first graduating class.
