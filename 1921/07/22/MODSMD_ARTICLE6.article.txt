# DANCE WILL FOLLOW PALO ALTO PLAYERS' PRODUCTION, FRIDAY
## Levy to Take Leading Role Opposite Marion Pritchard In Mrs. Temple's Telegram 
### 
Today the ticket drawings were
held for "Mrs. Temple's Telegram,"
which is to be produced one week
from tonight, in the Assembly Hall, by
the Palo Alto Players. The cast is
composed of both Palo Altans and
Campus people and the individuals
have puite some reputation as actors
011 the other end of the Toonerville
branch. There will be a one-o'clock
dance immediately after the play in
the Women's Clubhouse.
Scherl Levy, who played the hunch
back in the "Yellow Jacket," has the
part of Frank Fuller, the friend in
need who seems slated for the role
of the innocent bystander. Friend
Jack has lied to his wife, and what is
more, must make it good or find a new
home in which to throw ashes on the
parlor floor. The reason is that in
stead of admitting that he was out
on a solo party, he sneaked off on the
pretense of seeing his sick friend,
Jones, who never existed outside of
Jack's imagination. Therefore, since
it is the wifely wish to meet husband's
poor sick friend, something must be
done or she will find out who was
with him during that night, stalled
in the top car of a ferris wheel.
Marion Pitchard will make her de
but in this production, appearing as
Mrs. Fuller. The part is full of senti
ment and sentimentality, and Miss
Pritchard has surprised Coach Frank
Moore by the spirit with which she
handles the role, considering her in
experience.
Although the cast is comparatively
unknown oil the campus, those who
have attended the rehearsals guaran
tee a polished mid clever performance.
The play itself abounds in wit and
has all of the light charm of a good
farce.
There are a few good seats left in
both the balcony and the main floor.
The prices are fifty and seventy-five
cents.
