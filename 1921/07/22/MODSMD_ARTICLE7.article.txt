# SOPHOMORE DANCE TICKETS SELL RAPIDLY
## 
### 
Tickets for the sophomore dance
are rapidly becoming scarce as the
advance sales have almost consumed
the one hundred admittances set as
the limit. There are still some tick
ets left for sale which will be disposed
of to the first $1.65 checks offered.
Hackett's orchestra will furnish the
music for the fifth of August, and the
Women's Clubhouse, the spring floor.
Notwithstanding the popularity of
water since the Volstead doldrums en
wrapped the country, the chairman,
W. L. Sandberg, has arranged for
some punch. However, like the old
lady's pie, if nobody wants any, it will
be sent back. Two weeks from to
night is the date.
