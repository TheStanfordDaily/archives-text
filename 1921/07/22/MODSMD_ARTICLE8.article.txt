## Sam Hume and Irving Pichel Lead in "The Importance of Being Earnest" Cast

Finished acting applied to clever
plot structure made "The Importance
of Being Earnest," presented by the
Greek Theater Players, under the
auspices of the Renaissance Club in
the Assembly Hall, last night, one of
the distinct dramatic treats of the
year.
The comedy, one of Oscar Wilde's
best, gains its appeal through a combi
nation of wit and situation. The plot
moves about a put, a device usu
ally receiving condemnation but in
this piece, admirable, because of the
wit following it. The play proceeds
with two love affairs, surrounding mis
taken identity, and ends with a third
when Worthing discovers "The Im
portance of Being Earnest."
In handling the repartee which gives
the charm to the comedy, Samuel
Hume and Irving Pichel, as Algernon
and Worthing, were the outstanding
figures of the evening. Hume, who is
well-known throughout the country as
one of the founders of the Little The
atre movement, as well as an actor
'
and producer, again came up to the
standard which made him stand out
as Colonel Pickering, in Shaw's "Pyg-1
malion," given here during the spring
quarter. His calmly nonchalant in
terpretation of the unperturbable,
ever-hungry Algernon, admirably
brought out the humor of the part.
Pichel closely contested Hume for
first honors, in his portrayal of Worth
ing, the real Ernest in the plot. Pichel
is not a newcomer to Stanford audi
ences who will remember him as
Higgins in "Pygmalion" and as the
lead in "Pierre Pataiin," given by the
class in dramatics, which he conduct
ed on the campus last summer. His
was a part more eccentric and brought
into relief by the studied calmness
of Algernon. His description of his
"terminus" family connections to Lady
Bracknell was one of the high-lights
of the humor of the play.
The part of Lady Bracknell, "Aunt f
Augusta," on whose consent rested j
the happy ending of the play, was
well carried by Miss Florence Locke.
Her interpretation of the frankly
mercenary English mother was sus
tained, throughout and added much to
the attraction of the comedy. Rich
enda Stevick and Emma Knox played
as Gwendolen and Cecilly, the objects
of the affections of Algernon and
Worthy. Miss Knox is possessed of
a quaint naivete particularly suited
to Cecily while Miss Stevick's inter
pretation of the sophisticated Gwendo
len was impaired at times by the lack 1
of tone-carrying power in her voice.
The true comic element in the play
was given in the characters of Miss
Prism and Rev. Chasuble, by Vera
Morse and Gordon Davis. Davis
made the most of his part and his
characterization of the English divine !
brought repeated laughter from the
audience.
The attendance was especially good !
for the summer quarter production
and points to an evident interest in
this type of drama.
