## New Chief is Firm Believer in Possibilities of Success on Gridiron This Season 
### A. R. Boone, '24

He looked me full in the eye. His
hand was extended, and the grip firm,
as we exchanged greetings.
"I'm glad to know you," he said,
and I knew he meant it.
That's the kind of man Coach Van
Gent —the / Gene of Wisconsin days
—is.
He is built much like Director
Powell, sturdy, husky and well-knit.
His face, if one may consider the face
of a football coach, is blond, as is his
hair. And he carries himself like any
good football coach.
What interests Coach Van Gent of
Stanford more than a few words in his
praise, though, is football prospects of
1921. They are, one might say, "in the
future," so why discuss them? But
the future is too immediate, as the
new coach ventured to remark, and
his plays for the squad are already
being formulated.
"What are your plans for the first
part of the season?" he was asked.
"Work," was the laconic reply.
"And later?"
"More work."
So that's the program he outlines
for the men who will turn out when
the first whistle sounds on September
15th, the first day of fall football train
ing.
At the dinner for Stanford alumni
in San Francisco yesterday, Coach
Van Gent met other Stanford men, men
of days gone by.
Tlicre lie observed more of that in
tangible thing known as Stanford
"Spirit," and spoke a few words about
football.
Today, Van Gent is journeying to
Sacramento, where he will spend the
rest of the summer. His vacation,
from today until the day the first
string, second string, third string and
all the "filler" men don their mole
skins and cleated shoes will undoubt
edly be filled with thoughts of and
for "the t.eam." He knows there's a
big job ahead of him, in developing
one.
"A championship," he said, and he
smiled, "comes from skill, work and
good sportsmanship. Of the three,
I'm inclined to think the latter the
most important. For without it, a
championship would be worth nothing.
"I know Stanford men are made of
the right sort of stuff, however, and
when that first whistle blows in Sep
tember, I want to see all the men on
their toes. And when I say 'Let's Go!'
I want to see about 400 men out there
go! It takes that sort of stuff to put
over a winning team. Stanford can
do it this fall."

hair. And he carries himself like any
good football coach.
What interests Coach Van Gent of
Stanford more than a few words in his
praise, though, is football prospects of
1921. They are, one might say, "in the
future," so why discuss them? But
the future is too immediate, as the
new coach ventured to remark, and
his plays for the squad are already
being formulated.
"What are your plans for the first
part of the season?" he was asked.
"Work," was the laconic reply.
"And later?"
"More work."
So that's the program he outlines
for the men who will turn out when
the first whistle sounds on September
15th, the first day of fall football train
ing.
At the dinner for Stanford alumni
in San Francisco yesterday, Coach
Van Gent met other Stanford men, men
of days gone by.
Tlicre lie observed more of that in
tangible thing known as Stanford
"Spirit," and spoke a few words about
football.
Today, Van Gent is journeying to
Sacramento, where he will spend the
rest of the summer. His vacation,
from today until the day the first
string, second string, third string and
all the "filler" men don their mole
skins and cleated shoes will undoubt
edly be filled with thoughts of and
for "the t.eam." He knows there's a
big job ahead of him, in developing
one.
"A championship," he said, and he
smiled, "comes from skill, work and
good sportsmanship. Of the three,
I'm inclined to think the latter the
most important. For without it, a
championship would be worth nothing.
"I know Stanford men are made of
the right sort of stuff, however, and
when that first whistle blows in Sep
tember, I want to see all the men on
their toes. And when I say 'Let's Go!'
I want to see about 400 men out there
go! It takes that sort of stuff to put
over a winning team. Stanford can
do it this fall."
