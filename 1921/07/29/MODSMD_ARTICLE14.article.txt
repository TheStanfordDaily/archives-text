# "Freshman Bibles" Will Be Distributed Soon
## 
### 
"Stanford Bibles," which for years
hav ebeen distributed to incoming
freshmen, are being put out in an
other edition for the members of the
1925 class, and there is a possibility
that they will be distributed before
the end of the current quarter. The
"bibles" are replete with information
concerning Stanford, Stanford cus
toms, Stanford songs, and other topics
on which the freshman must inform
himself before he can really become
an integral part of the "farm." They
are distributed each quarter under
the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
