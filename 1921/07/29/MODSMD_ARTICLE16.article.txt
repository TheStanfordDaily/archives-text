# THE 						NEW "PROBATION"
## 
### 
After October Ist probation at Stanford wW no longer disqualify a
student from participation in college activities. Ihe meaning that Stan
ford men have always entertained with the notion of pro, theietoie.
is no longer a tradition of the University and it will never again he asso
ciated with athletic success or failure. The penalty element of proba
tion was abolished at the last meeting of the Academic Council after a
thorough investigation of the results of the system as it has been ptac
ticed. and the penalty provision was discontinued largely because of the
fact that it applied to but a small portion of the students who came \yith
in probation provisions, and did not get at the real causes of low student
standing.
Probation will stand, however, much .'is it stood before, but with a
somewhat higher scholarship requirement. A student at Stanford for
the first quarter will be placed on probation if he fails to make 22 counts,
and disqualified totally on failing to make 10 counts,
For subsequent quarters a student will be disqualified on making
less than 15 counts. The sum of hours credited and grade points go
to make up "counts."
Deficiency in general average will also place a student on probation,
If at the end of any quarter after the first any student has less than one
grade point for every registered unit he will be placed on "pro." Dis
qualification will result after a deficiency ranging from that of 20 grade
points at the end of the second quarter to 2 grade points at the end of the
fourteenth quarter.
Probation is now a warning. It means that for some cause or other
the student is not devoting sufficient time to studies, and that if im
provement is not made disqualification will result.
