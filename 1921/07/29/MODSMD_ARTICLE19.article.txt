"Many of the ideals of the Latin-
American peoples are higher than our
own, even though we are accustomed
to regard America as the leader of
western idealism," declared Dr. John
Driscoll Fitz-Gerald, in his address
on "Hispano-American Ideals," Tues
day evening in the Little Theater.
Dr. Fitz-Gerald has had extensive
experience in Latin America, and gave
the audience some illustrations from
his contact with South American
peoples. He told of the enforcement
of ideals by organizations among the
students, who require certain stan
dards to be lived up to on penalty of
forfeiting membership in the social
group.
The entertainment of the sailors
from the American fleet in southern
waters during the war was cited as
another illustration of the way iii
which South American people

authors (tF several different countries
besides their o'wjl, and wondered how
many American young people could
do the same. He did not discuss the
reasons for the differences in cultural
training inferred by his observations.
The Pan-American Union was de
scribed by Dr. Fitz-Gerald as a dis
cussion group consisting of twenty

one nations. Each nation sends rep
resentatives on equal standing with
the other nations of the Union, as is
the case in the United States Senate.

the peoples of North and South Amer

the history, aims and ideals of our
southern neighbors.
