# CLEANER ATHLETICS AIM OF STANFORD COACHES COMBINE
## 
### 
The high school coaches who are
taking special training this summer at
Stanford have organized an association
called the "California Physical Edu
cators. W. E. Dunn, coach at Pasa
dena High School, is president, and
Howard Ray is vice-president.
The purpose of the organization is
to secure co-operation among the
coaches in the secondary schools of
the state in developing and maintain
ing high ideals of sportsmanship and
instruction in physical education.
The physical educators will carry out
the Hetherington plan of state-wide
physical education, which provides a
wide curriculum in athletics in each
high school, competition between
schools, and requires each student to
spend a minimum of 120 minutes a
week in physical exercise.
H. R. Stoltz, former director of phy
sical education at Stanford was elected
honorary president, and Dr. A. D.
Browne, the present director, was
elected honorary vice-president.
