# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS TO ROBLE WOMEN ON STANFORD HISTORY
## 
### 
An intimate glimpse or Stanford in
the making and the hardships con
nected with the early days of the Uni
versity, was given the women of Roble
I Hall, when Dr. Jordan addressed them
j informally following the dinner hour
last Sunday.
1 Dr. Jordan traced the history of the
University from the origin of the Stan-
I fords' purpose in founding it down to
I the present day, described in detail the
! months of trial after the death of
Senator Stanford when the affairs of
his estate were for a time unsettled
j and the income of the institution prac
i tically shut off.
"Stanford, as far as it can he said
| to be like any other university, was
( modeled after John Hopkins and Cor
i nell," said Dr. Jordan. The idea of
i advanced research facilities appealed
I to the Stanfords and it was their de
sire to include as much equipment
|as possible. Work in the advanced de
! partments in Engineering and Medi
! cine was retarded greatly during the
i early years of the University and it
was necessary to send many students
1 in these branches to the eastern uni
] versities. "It was at this time that
1 til® HVG hundred limit was placed on
the women students," said Dr. Jordan,
"because Mrs. Stanford had earlv
made a stipulation that
jtho number of women students should,.
j equal that of the men, th«»» *'
i"- ~j should be
united."
__
I Ihe task of gathering a faculty,
; which fell to Dr. Jordan, as the first,
j president of Stanford, was outlined
i with intimate comments. The whole
(account was characterized by the
humorous observations for which Dr.
! Jordan is so well-known.
