# Surface of Football Field Being Prepared For Fall
## 
### 
In preparation for the opening of
football practice, workmen are reno
vating the surface of the main field,
which will still be used until the
formal opening of the stadium. The
field has been moved, and now loose
loam is being carefully scattered over
the surface in order that it may be
fully ready for hard service following
September 15, when Coach A. E. Van
Gent and assistants will start the
squads moving.
The wrecking of the west bleach
ers, in preparation for their use in
the stadium has practically been com
pleted.
