# MRS. TEMPLE'S TELEGRAM TO BE PRESENTED TONIGHT
## 
### 
Tonight, in the Assembly Hall, the
Palo Alto Players' Club, will make
its bow, presenting "Mrs. Temple's
Telegram," a light three-act farce, the
proceeds of which will be turned over
to the Benefit Welfare for Disabled
Veterans. The production is sponsor
ed by the Fremont Post of the Amer
ican Legion, and will be followed by
a one-o'clock dance at the Women's
Clubhouse, for which the Associated
Federal Students are responsible.
The play is from the pens of William
Morris and Frank Wyatt, who are

specialists in the realm of comedy.
A recent release from one of the
Hollywood constellations had the name
and, what's more, was vaguely similar
to the play. "Mrs. Temple's Tele
gram" has everything needed for a
good comedy, and has been success
fully produced both in moving pic
tures and legitimate drama.
Roy Hendrick, '21, and Scherl M.
Levy, '24, take the leading male roles
of Jack Temple and Frank Fuller,
respectively. Temple makes a mistake
in being forced to stay away from his
jealous wife all night. Of course he
didn't know that the ferris wheel
would stick and because he as afraid
that the Mrs. is liable to be just as
ignorant and even more unreasonable,
friend Frank is pressed into service
under an alias as the poor sick friend.
The action is a glorious carnival of
perjury, but, as ever, censors and
doting parents will be pratified to
know that everybody is forgiven and
guileless at the final curtain.
For the most part the cast is in
experienced, a fault which has been
but slightly noticeable in rehearsal.
Coach Frank Moore has almost over
come this consciousness and expects
to have an entirely finished cast for
the evening's entertainment. Hendrick,
Levy, Marion Pritchard, '23, C. E.
Weaver, '22, and Earle Smith, '25, are
the only campus people in the cast.
The rest of the players are from Palo
Alto and have a bit more experience
in former town productions and all
are well suited to their parts.
Seats of fairly good location are
still obtainable and will be on sale
at the box-office this evening. The
prices are 50c and 75c.
