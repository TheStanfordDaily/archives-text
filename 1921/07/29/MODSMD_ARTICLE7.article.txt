# AUTUMN SCHEDULE IS ANNOUNCED BY GRADUATE MANAGER
## Pre-War System Will be Used Once More to Develop Men to Beat Bears, November 19 
### 
"As many games as possible for as
many teams as possible" will be the
policy of the Athletic Management in
football next fall, as outlined by
George Fletcher, the new Athletic
Manager. It is planned to form sec
ond, third, and fourth teams, in order
to develop football material which is
not quite of Varsity caliber, but
which, with proper handling, may
show first-team class later on. Out
side competition will be secured for
these teams, and thus much material
which would otherwise be overlooked
will probably be discovered. This
policy was in use before the war, and
was very successful. It is believed
that the return to it will benefit foot
ball conditions materially.
Officials for all of the games next
fall have not been named as yet, but
Fletcher is trying to get. George Varnell
as the referee of the Big Game.
The tentative schedule is as fol
lows.
