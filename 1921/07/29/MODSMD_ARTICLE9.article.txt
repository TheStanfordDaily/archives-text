### 
The Campus Quoit Kings, otherwise
known as the University Tress team,
have no fears for the hard-boiled heav
ers who use nothing but horse-meat
for a training diet. The Press sharks
have been training with doughnuts for
months, and have attained such a de
gree of expertness 'that they â€¢ now
claim to be able to ring a stake at
fifteen paces consistently, provided
the doughnuts are made by any one
of the ladies on the force. Their chal
lenge to the campus horseshoe champs
to do battle for a keg of home-brew
is printed below.
"The University Press challenges the
horseshie champs of the University to
a game of quoits to be played during
the noon hour on the Press Grounds.
"The stakes are forty feet apart, six
inches high. The ground is in good
condition.
"The Press believes it can outpitch
the champs who eat horse-meat, be
cause their menu consists of dough
nuts. We would prefer a keg of home
brew as the prize, but will consider
ice cream as a weak sub. or a pack
age of Home Run Cigarettes.
