The total number of students in at
tendance at the University for the
second half of the Summer Quarter
is approximately the same as the
registration for the first half of the
quarter, slightly over one thousand.
About fifty new students registered
July 28, which was the date of registra

40 old students re-registered, so since
some students left the University, the
registration remains the same.
