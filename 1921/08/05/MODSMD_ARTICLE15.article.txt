# A 						VALUED PRIVILEGE
## 
### 
New graduate students of the University were considerably dis
appointed to find that certain privileges that had come to be regarded as
the right of this class of students were withdrawn immediately after they
qualified to enjoy them. The removal of privileges associated with
greater time for registration which previously had been allowed to grad
uates lias been the cause of much discussion and regret among the men
and women concerned.
A reason given for the new requirement that all must complete regis
tration on registration day is that graduates formerly abused the per
mission of late registration; and it is true that many allowed a great
lx>rtion of the quarter to pass before turning in complete data at the
Administration I'.uilding. Undoubtedly this inexcusable carelessness
caused much trouble and contusion at the Registrar s office. Still, if this
is tlit- real reason for the changing of the graduate's extra time
could it not have been satisfied by setting a definite period of time within
which to complete registering, five days after the regular registration
date, for example.
( )f course there may have been other reasons for removing the
privilege. Yet the Administration Building is always very crowded on
registration day. and the requirement that some 300 or more graduate
students be added to the lines of that day would not make for greater
facilitation of registration. The division between graduates and under
graduates seems a logical one to relieve some of the congestion '>f regis
tration day.
Graduate students are often expected to prepare for their first
classes, while undergraduates usually are not. Graduates, too. feel that
they have in a measure earned the privilege of freedom from the contest
tor'places in the lines of registration day, and would appreciate even a
limited extra time allowance for completing registration.
