# CHINESE GIRLS TO BREAK OLD CUSTOM
## 
### 
Two radical innovations in Chinese
dramatic* history are introduced in
"Rainbow," a Chinese play to be given
in English by an all-Chinese cast, next
Friday night at the Assembly Hall as
a part of the program to be presented
by the Chinese Students' Club of
Stanford.
"Rainbow," will be a novel attrac
tion for local theatregoers, marking
the entrance of Chinese women into
theatrical casts for the first time in
the history of the Chinese stage. It
is a comedy rathef than the tradition
al Chinese tragedy.
Another feature of the variety bill
which vies with "Rainbow" for pre
mier honors will be the magic of
V. U. Wang, famous Chinese ma
gician. All the subtleness and mys
tery of the Orient is brought into
play by Wang, who it is said is cap
able of doing some remarkable stunts.
