# COMPTROLLER ROTH REVIEWS PROGRESS OF NEW BUILDINGS
## 
### 
Work on the Stanford Union, the
Basketball Pavillion, and the new ten
nis courts has been constantly impeded
during the summer by labor trouble,
and consequently their construction
has not advanced much over the pro
gress attained before the closing of
the University in June, Comptroller
Roth today stated in respect to the
building situation. There is a
force of men at work on the Basket
hall Pavillion, however, and it is pos
sible that more men will be added in
the near future, and that work on the
Pavillion will again catch up to the
schedule.
Construction of the new Union has
been badly slowed up by strikes, and
little work is being done at present.
A small force of men is at work on
the Nurses' Home, and work there is
going forward steadily.
Six New Tennis Courts
Completed
Six new tennis courts for women
have been completed and are ready
for use. These courts are so con
structed that they may be used for
baseball and hockey, the posts being
removable. This forms quite a con
siderable addition to the women's ath
letic equipment.
Six new courts will also be con
structed for men students. Surveying
and grading of the land have been
completed by Engineer Keefer, and
work on these will be started as soon
as labor can be obtained.
Wrecking of the old football bleach
ers has been nearly completed. The
old field will be used to play the pre
liminary games of the season, and en
ough seats will be left to accommodate
the attendance at these games.
