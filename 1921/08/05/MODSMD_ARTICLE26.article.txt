# DR. H. L. STEWART REVIEWS THEORIES OF H. G. WELLS
## 
### Walter Warren, '22 
"Why be content with unchallenged
traditions in politics, education and
morals, while you are eager for experi
mental knowledge in chemistry, medi
cine and other branches of science?"
This question, according to Dr. Her
bert Leslie Stewart, is the goad with
which Mr. H. G. Wells, the great Eng
lish philosopher, is trying to prick the
conscience of the world.
Dr. Stewart is one of the visiting pro
fessors on the Stanford summer faculty.
He comes from Dalhousie University,
Halifax, an institution founded on the
profits made by the preying of Canadian
privateers on American shipping during
the War of 1812. "We got our start by
spoiling the Egyptians," said Stewart.
"Now our chief exports are college pres
idents and premiers."
Author of several books, and writer
of numerous magazine articles, Dr.
Stewart is especially well fitted to criti
cize the works of Mr. Wells. He is a
native of Ireland. According to "Who's
Who,'' he had a veritable mania for tak
ing prizes in student days at Oxford.
Leaving Oxford, he spent two years at
Edinburgh, and then lectured in the Uni
versity of Belfast during a period of
four years. Since 1913 he has been Pro
fessor of Philosophy at Dalhousie.
"Wells' chief aim is to provoke, his
readers to independent thought. His
attacks are against the habit of mental
laziness on subjects of public welfare.
'Why do you permit your thought and
practice on social affairs to lag behind
your thought and practice in other fields
of science?' Wells repeatedly asks.
"The enormous popularity Mr. Wells
enjoys is a sign of our present times,
and not a bad sign. Piquant humor,
imaginative brilliance, skill in character
ization, and an alluring flavor of anti
conventionalism are gifts that Mr. Wells
possesses to a high degree.
"It is a great thing that a man of such
brilliant gifts and compelling popular
appeal should exert himself just now to
focus thought upon problems of supreme
importance. The authority of the

prophet has been shown by Mr. Wells
in that he does not ridicule the follies
of our grandfathers, but our own.
"Our prophet names his reforms So
cialism, and despite the misleading sug
gestion, there is no better term. It is
no crude resharing of property that he
recommends. That, lie says, would be
the teeth and claws without the eyes of
Socialism. What lie preaches is the
doctrine of collective purpose; a bold
interference in the vast field of conduct
that lias so far been looked upon as a
strictly private concern. He would create
an international statesmanship that
would prevent the burning of unsalable
wheat in America while people arc starv
ing in India. His world state would
sterilize the world of its deadliest dis
ease—war.
"Mr. Wells has little respect for the
notion of exclusive nationality. He
preaches the only possible peace, the
peace of a world state.
"Two defects in Mr. Wells must be
noticed. He has gone out of the sphere
in which he is effective, and he has failed
through two of his own best qualities,
his passion for simplicity and his turn
for wit. He is always over-simplifying,
and his humor is disastrous when humor
is the very last thing that is wanted.
One of the dangers of a flashing wit is
that is wants to flash all the time, and
in its eagerness to get into action refuses
to be delayed by mere want of knowl
edge about the subject to be burlesqued.
"Yet we must not quarrel with the
good gifts that Mr. We.lls has been so
disrespectful of because we have not
found in the same person a winsome
literary artist, a wise monitor in high
politics, a social reformer of great fe
cundity in suggestion and a faultless
teacher of the deep things of life and
destiny. We must be thankful to take
Mr. Wells as we have found him. Even
when he makes us angry, especially
when lie makes us angry, he forces us
to think. What higher service can a
man of letters perform?"

found in the same person a winsome
literary artist, a wise monitor in high
politics, a social reformer of great fe
cundity in suggestion and a faultless
teacher of the deep things of life and
destiny. We must be thankful to take
Mr. Wells as we have found him. Even
when he makes us angry, especially
when lie makes us angry, he forces us
to think. What higher service can a
man of letters perform?"
"Why be content with unchallenged
traditions in politics, education and
morals, while you are eager for experi

This question, according to Dr. Her
bert Leslie Stewart, is the goad with
which Mr. H. G. Wells, the great Eng
lish philosopher, is trying to prick the
conscience of the world.
Dr. Stewart is one of the visiting pro
fessors on the Stanford summer faculty.
He comes from Dalhousie University,
Halifax, an institution founded on the
profits made by the preying of Canadian
privateers on American shipping during
the War of 1812. "We got our start by
spoiling the Egyptians," said Stewart.
"Now our chief exports are college pres
idents and premiers."
Author of several books, and writer
of numerous magazine articles, Dr.
Stewart is especially well fitted to criti
cize the works of Mr. Wells. He is a
native of Ireland. According to "Who's
Who,'' he had a veritable mania for tak
ing prizes in student days at Oxford.
Leaving Oxford, he spent two years at
Edinburgh, and then lectured in the Uni
versity of Belfast during a period of
four years. Since 1913 he has been Pro
fessor of Philosophy at Dalhousie.
"Wells' chief aim is to provoke, his
readers to independent thought. His
attacks are against the habit of mental
laziness on subjects of public welfare.
'Why do you permit your thought and
practice on social affairs to lag behind
your thought and practice in other fields
of science?' Wells repeatedly asks.
"The enormous popularity Mr. Wells
enjoys is a sign of our present times,
and not a bad sign. Piquant humor,
imaginative brilliance, skill in character
ization, and an alluring flavor of anti
conventionalism are gifts that Mr. Wells
possesses to a high degree.
"It is a great thing that a man of such
brilliant gifts and compelling popular
appeal should exert himself just now to
focus thought upon problems of supreme
importance. The authority of the

prophet has been shown by Mr. Wells
in that he does not ridicule the follies
of our grandfathers, but our own.
"Our prophet names his reforms So
cialism, and despite the misleading sug
gestion, there is no better term. It is
no crude resharing of property that he
recommends. That, lie says, would be
the teeth and claws without the eyes of
Socialism. What lie preaches is the
doctrine of collective purpose; a bold
interference in the vast field of conduct
that lias so far been looked upon as a
strictly private concern. He would create
an international statesmanship that
would prevent the burning of unsalable
wheat in America while people arc starv
ing in India. His world state would
sterilize the world of its deadliest dis
ease—war.
"Mr. Wells has little respect for the
notion of exclusive nationality. He
preaches the only possible peace, the
peace of a world state.
"Two defects in Mr. Wells must be
noticed. He has gone out of the sphere
in which he is effective, and he has failed
through two of his own best qualities,
his passion for simplicity and his turn
for wit. He is always over-simplifying,
and his humor is disastrous when humor
is the very last thing that is wanted.
One of the dangers of a flashing wit is
that is wants to flash all the time, and
in its eagerness to get into action refuses
to be delayed by mere want of knowl
edge about the subject to be burlesqued.
"Yet we must not quarrel with the
good gifts that Mr. We.lls has been so
disrespectful of because we have not
found in the same person a winsome
literary artist, a wise monitor in high
politics, a social reformer of great fe
cundity in suggestion and a faultless
