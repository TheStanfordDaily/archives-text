# VISITING EASTERNER SPEAKS IN LITTLE THEATRE TUESDAY
## Racial Conflicts Discussed in Lecture by Madison Grant Lawyer of New York City 
### 
"Has the World War advanced the
western boundaries of Asia to a line
from Danzig to Trieste?" This ques
tion was the climax of the address of
Mr. Madison Grant in the Little The
atre, Tuesday night, on "Relations Be
tween European and Asiatic Races."
Grant is an attorney of New York City,
who has spent a number of years of
painstaking study of the races of the
world.
"The history of the world is the
story of the intermingling of and the
warfare between the Nordic, Alpine
and Mongolic races," declared Rrant.
"These races are the only ones that
made rapid progress in evolution after
the primary development of man in
south-central Eurasia.
"The Nordic race migrated to the
northwestern part of Europe, where
its characteristics of fair skin, blue
eyes and tall stature became more
pronounced. The Alpine race moved
westward and settled about the Medi
terranean. The Mongolids spread over
Asia, developing (he first civilizations
known to history. This numerous race
has always been restless, frequently
tending expeditions of conquest against
i lie Nordic peoples.
"The Mongol rush under Attila was
the cause of the German move on
Home which resulted in the fall of that
empire. The Mongol invation reached
its western limit, at Tours, France,
early in the Christian era. Charle
magne's great work was the turning
back of the receding borders of Eu
rope toward Asia. When he began
the Asiatic frontier was on the River
Elbe.
"European civilization was threaten
ed later 011 when the ho. des of the
empire of Genghis Kahn surged west

ward past the Caspian Sea. They
devastated the territory they passed
through, exterminated the inhabitants,
destroyed the cities and left no trace
of civilization. Western Asia has not
yet recovered from these depreda
tions. The battle of Wahlstadt is
probably one of the most decisive
battles in the world's history, for al
though the Christians were defeated,
the Mongol hordes turned away and
European civilization was saved.
■•Russia'"and the Balkan states are
popularly regarded as parts of Eu
ropean civilization, but they derived
their culture from the empire of By
zantium. The minor divisions of the
Russian people, including the nations
which have recently become independ
ent states, are Asiatic rather than
European in origin, nature and in
stincts.
"The creation of these separate
states where the mass of people is of
Mongol descent may have advanced the
Asiatic frontier to a line running from
Danzig on the Baltic to Trieste on
the Adriatic Sea.
"While this struggle over the east
ern frontier of Europe has been going
on, the western frontier has advanced
westward until today the advance
guard of the Europeans has caught
up with the rear guard of the west
ern coast of America."
