# BERKELEY PLAYERS TO PRESENT COMEDY DIRECTED BY DAVIS
## "Belinda'' Practically a Campus Play Co-Starring Les Seib and Coach G. Davis. 
### 
After topping off the Greek Theatre
summer season at the University of
California with "Belinda," Dramatic
Coach Gordon Davis has arranged to
present the play in which he and
Lester Seib co-star, or this campus
Thursday, August 18th. He has suc
ceeded in bringing the comedy to
Stanford in exactly the same form in
which it was staged at Wheeler Hall,
when the public demanded its repe
tition, although it entails the post
ponement of the leading lady's Eu
ropean voyage.
Florence Locke, who takes the part
of Belinda, will take a train for New
York and a later boat, the morning
of the nineteenth. She has been ap
pearing, during the first part of the
summer, with the Greek Theatre
Players and with great success, tak
ing the part of Lady Bracknell in
"The Importance of Being Earnest,"
which was recently produced on the
campus. She is noted all through the
coast region as an actress of merit.
The play is by A. A. Milne, the
author of "Mr. Pim Passes By," which
is having such a successful run in
New York. Ethel Barrymore origin
ally played the title role and later
Henrietta Grossman appeared as Be
linda Tremayne. The comedy is of
the whimsical, hearty, sort that dis
tinguishes Milne and is especially well
received in university communities.
The staging is under the direction
of Davis, and he and Seib play the
rival suitors. Davis has his initial
character part in "Belinda," that of
(he local scientist with statistical in
clinations. Although he has ascertain
ed that the lunacy of a certain county
is increasing, it not only fails to hor
rify but heightens his desire for the
hand of the handsome Belinda. Neither
he or the poetic and temperamental
impressionist, played by Seib, imagine
that "Belinda" is only a constituent in
"Mrs. Belinda Tremayne," and that
besides a husband, there is a grown
daughter, and as each concludes his
courtship with a characteristic pro
posal, things begin to happen.
Morris Ankrum, conceded to be the
best student actor at California, plays
Ihe part of John Tremayne, Belinda's
absent but no less respected husband.
His latest appearance in the Berkeley
theatre was in "Kitmet," as the leading
man. Emma Knox, who played the
ward in the last production, will take
the part of Miss Delia Tremayne and
Genevieve Butterfield will play Betty.
The play will be sponsored by the
Dramatic Council.

that "Belinda" is only a constituent in
"Mrs. Belinda Tremayne," and that
besides a husband, there is a grown
daughter, and as each concludes his
courtship with a characteristic pro
posal, things begin to happen.
Morris Ankrum, conceded to be the
best student actor at California, plays
Ihe part of John Tremayne, Belinda's
absent but no less respected husband.
His latest appearance in the Berkeley
theatre was in "Kitmet," as the leading
man. Emma Knox, who played the
ward in the last production, will take
the part of Miss Delia Tremayne and
Genevieve Butterfield will play Betty.
The play will be sponsored by the
Dramatic Council.
