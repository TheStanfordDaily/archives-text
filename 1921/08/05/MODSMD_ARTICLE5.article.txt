# DR. TAYLOR, FOOD RESEARCH DIRECTOR, VISITS THE CAMPUS
## Drs. Alsberg and Davis Will Assist in Food Manufacture and Economic Departments 
### 
Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, director of the
Stanford Food Research Institute,
reached the campus last Monday for a
brief visit before going on his vacation,
after which he will return to take up
the preliminaries of the institute's work,
preparatory to its opening the first of
October.
The Stanford Food Research Institute
has been established by the Carnegie In
stitute, with an endowment of $700,000
for ten years, for the purpose of study
ing all the phases of the production, dis
tribution, and consumption of food, and
to co-operate and aid other organizations
in the same fild. The work of the In
stitute will be carried on by Dr. Taylor
in conjunction with Dr. Alsberg and
Davis, both of whom will be on the
campus prior to the opening of the In
stitute.
Dr. Taylor has for some weeks past
been gathering such material as will be
needed in the opening work of the In
stitute, and ir. his trip to Stanford from
the East he has interviewed numc.rous
professors as to the scope of work the
Institute will undertake. Dr. Taylor
will direct the studies in the field of
physiology and the chemistry of nutri
tion ; Dr. Alsberg those in the chemistry
of food manufacture and agriculture,
and Dr. Davis those in economics and
iood transportation.
Each of these three professors comes
to take his position highly recommended,
and leaving behind him a good position.
Dr. Taylor resigned the professorship of
physiological chemistry at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania to accept this post,
