# Disarmament Will Relieve Financial Burden Says Hirst
## 
### 
"The people of the world can't make
any recovery from the World War if the
governments continue to prepare for an
other," declared Professor Francis W.
Hirst, editor of the London Economist,
in a le-cttire at Stanford University.
"Eight billlion dollars a year is now
being spent on armaments and little
wars," lie said. "Can you expect the
world to return to a full employment
until part of that load is removed?
"Even as moderate a de-crease of ex
penditures as to lower the costs of main
taining an army and a navy from the
1921 costs to those of 1912 would relieve
Europe and America of thousands of
millions of dollars, which would go into
the people's pockets—some of it; credit
would be relieved, debts paid, and some
public and private bankruptcies would be
atoided."

Professor Hirst, who visits the United
States at the. request of Stanford Uni
versity and the University of California,
declared that the great profits in the
shipping industry have ceased.
"The world has more ships," he said,
"than are required for overseas com
merce and passengers, despite the great
submarine industry. The German in
demnity vessels that came to England
caused nothing but dismay and a flatten
ing of prices.
"Now r , manufacturing is slowing.
Judge Gary, president of the United
States Steel Corporation, told me re
cently that bis corporation is not work
ing more than 25 per cent capacity. Sir
Hugh Bell, the largest manufacturer of
steel in Great Britain, can only manu
facture at a loss, he tells me.
"Am I optimistic for the future? I'd
rather take 110 stand.
"But the real effect seems to hi that
prices and wages must he readjusted,
and that workmen must learn the differ
ence betwec.n real and paper wages, and
he content with wages something like as
good ;ts before the war. Otherwise they
will have to choose between low wages
and unemployment."
Professor Hirst advocates disarma
ment. but suggests the return to 1912
expenditures as a substitute, which
would save for the United States alone
$1,179,00(1,00(1 annually.
