# PROFESSOR TREAT TO LEAVE SHORTLY FOR THE FAR EAST
## Stanford Authority on Orient Will Lecture in Japanese and Chinese Universities 
### 
In response to invitations from the
Chinese and Japanese governments,
Professor Payson J. Treat, interna
tionally known as authority on Far
Eastern Affairs, and member of the
Far Eastern History Department of
the University, will lecture at the two
great Chinese universities, and the four
great Japanese universities.
Professor Treat will sail for Japan
on August 23, on the Shyno Maru.
In Japan he will lecture at the Imperi
al universities at Tokyo and Kyoto,
and the two private universities at
Waseda and Kaio.
After leaving Japan, Professor
Treat will go to China, to deliver a
second series of lectures.
While in Canton, Professor Treat
will be the guest of the mayor of Can
ton, who is a son of Dr. Sun Yat Sen.
The mayor was a student in some of
Professor Treat's courses several
years ago.
"Political conditions in China," Prof.
Treat stated recently, "are in such a
state of chaos, with two governments
existing, that one can learn more in
a few months there, than he can in
several years by attempting to gather
information thousands of miles away."
It is expected in governmental
circles that Prof. Treat's forthcom
ing book on "America and Japan" will
serve to clarify some of the issues
which will arrive when the Conference
on Disarmament and Pacific Problems
convenes in Washington. This book,
to be published by the Houghton Miff
lin Company, Boston, will form the
basis of Prof. Treat's lectures in the
Far East.
