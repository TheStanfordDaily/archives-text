# SEIB AND DAVIS WILL PLAY LEADS IN 'BELINDA' THURSDAY
## Milne Comedy to be Produced by Greek Theatre Players Under G. Davis' Direction 
### 
Thursday evening, Gordon Davis will
present the Greek Theatre Players in "Be
linda," a farcical comedy by A. A. Milne.
The. production will be a typical Stan
ford show with Davis directing, and he
and Seil) co-starring. The comedy itself
is one of the most recent and popular of
Milne's, once editor of "Punch," the
English humorous magazine, and now
famous as the author of "Mr. Pim
Passes By," which is having so success
ful a season in New York. Scats will go
on sale Tuesday at 1:30 in the Adminis
tration Building and at Cranadll's, in
Palo Alto, for the uniform price of
$1.10.
"Belinda" has been well received
wherever presented, and the. Berkeley
audience demanded a repetition of the
performance when it was given as the
last of the Greek Theatre summer series,
last month. Although the royalties on
the play are the largest since the "Yel
low Jacket," it* is planned to have the
next dramatic series of the fall opened
at Berkeley by this comedy. The plot of
the play is farcical, the chief appeal be
ing in the quaint, whimsical lines.
It is the story of the middle-agexl
woman, who appears to be neighborly
with thirty, and whose husband was list
ed among the missing, after a spat, in
the dim, dim past. Notwithstanding the
cruelties of time and all that, Belinda is
still beautiful enough to command the
attentions of an eJderly scientist, who di
vides his time between her bright eyes
and the statistics on the growth of in
sanity in the County of Devonshire.
Besides the scientific observer, which
part is played by Davis, a poet,
young, and full of lofty ideas on im
pressionism, cosmos, and flowing bow
tics, is w >oing Belinda. Belinda's daugh
ter comes home from college in due and
opportune time, and Les Se.ib, who is
disguised as the poet, abandons his love
and bites the dust before daughter.
She is at present passing as a niece,
for no matter how good one is with fig
tires, nothing can be really proved on a
niece. Since he is so much in love, the
"poet is not particularly interested Jn the
test of love which Belinda has ordained,
namely, to find her niece's father, but lie
cannot bring himself to desertion.
Both suitors undertake the quest of
the missing man, one Robinson, who has
a mole on his elbow and a daughter, who
is Belinda's niece. In the midst of the.
quest a stranger enters, moderately
handsome although not melodramati
cally, and meets the family. It is the
missing spouse of Belinda, but he does
not care, to have it shouted about, so an
nonnces himself as Robinson. Then the
mole is discovered, identities established,
the poet wins the girl and the wife her
husband, lunacy is discovered to have
phenomenally increased, and it is found
that the whole thing was very p!ias;;nt
as staged before the simple gray set.
