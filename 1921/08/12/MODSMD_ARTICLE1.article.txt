# SEIB AND DAVIS WILL PLAY LEADS IN 'BELINDA' THURSDAY
## Milne Comedy to be Produced by Greek Theatre Players Under G. Davis' Direction 
### 
Thursday evening, Gordon Davis will
present the Greek Theatre Players in "Be
linda," a farcical comedy by A. A. Milne.
The. production will be a typical Stan
ford show with Davis directing, and he
and Seil) co-starring. The comedy itself
is one of the most recent and popular of
Milne's, once editor of "Punch," the
English humorous magazine, and now
famous as the author of "Mr. Pim
Passes By," which is having so success

on sale Tuesday at 1:30 in the Adminis

Palo Alto, for the uniform price of
$1.10.

last month. Although the royalties on
the play are the largest since the "Yel

and the statistics on the growth of in
sanity in the County of Devonshire.
Besides the scientific observer, which
part is played by Davis, a poet,
