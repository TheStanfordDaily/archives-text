# SECOND TRIAL
## 
### 
The unusually low disqualification requirement of seven counts,
below which a student will be dismissed during his first or second
quarter at Stanford, (ten counts after October), should not mislead
any as to the standard of satisfactory scholarship. No less than a "C"
average is sufficient to permit of graduation from Stanford, and any
hours of less grade during early quarters must be balanced by higher
grades later. (
A student may lose eight or ten hours, make four hours of "C
and yet have more than seven counts. Undoubtedly this is provided
with a view of allowing a second chance to students who get started
in the wrong department or wrong subjects. A certain eastern uni
versity under different rules allows students to transfer to a second
department after failing in a first, on the theory that new students in
college may make a bad decision as to the particular kind of work
for which they are fitted. Failing in a department for which they
are not qualified, they are allowed a second trial in another field.
This plan has incited much commendation throughout the country.
Stanford makes the same provision under the two-quarter seven
count ruling.
