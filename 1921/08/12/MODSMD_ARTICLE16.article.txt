# TRY THE TRACK
## 
### 
Although a great number of Stanford men have signed up for
track as their required physical training activity this quarter, interest in
the pentathlon planned by Coach Maloney has thus far been very low,
and unless more entrants are signed up immediately, the contest will be
called off.
The pentathlon events as arranged arc the high jump, javelin, broad
jump, discus, and the 100-yard dash. Entries are open to all save varsity
men, as the affair is primarily for novices. A prize is to be given to the
contestant who makes the highest average score in the five events.
The javelin and high jump will be run off one week, the discus and
the broad jump the next, concluding with the 100-yard dash in the third
week.
Stanford's best athletes have been developed from men who learned
the game on the Cardinal Oval. Coach Maloney, "Dad" Moulton. and
"Dink" Templeton are ready t<> aid and teach all who compete. Better
instruction is not available. Competitors for the Maloney Medal will
learn something about track, and will gain the advantage of good fellow
ship and the right sort of competition.
livery Stanford student should try to develop himself in the track
event for which he is best fitted. A better opportunity for beginning
than the present will never be offered.
