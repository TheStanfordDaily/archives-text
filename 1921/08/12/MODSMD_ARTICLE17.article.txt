# COACH POWELL SURE OF GOOD TURNOUT FOR 1921 FOOTBALL
## Many Veterans Will Be Here At the Opening Workout; Freshman Rally Next Week 
### 
With the opening practice of football
season hut a month away, much atten
tion is being turned toward gridiron
activities. Upon that date, Coach Van
Gent will be. ready to start the training
of the squad to battle the Blue and Gold
in the Big Game of 1921, the first to be*
held in the new Stanford stadium.
Prospects for the team are good at
the present time, states Coach W. T.
Powell, director of major athletics. Of
the veterans of last year's varsity and
freshman teams, some twenty will be
on hand this fall.
Captain Patrick will, be available for
the fullback berth; Pe.rshing, Helser,
De Groot, Harley, Carter, and McAlpine
play at tackle; Kirksev, Schlaudeman,
Benninger, are candidates for backfii'ld
positions; Stice, guard, will also be on
hand. It is to be regretted that Bob
Cravens, owing to an operation, will
probably not be able to play at guard.
In addition to these men, Bowden of
Texas, Luhlenberg, Hamilton, Cleveland,
Campbell, Ledecker, Greenwood, Faw
cett, Pallett and Betts, all who have,
played football before, will be available.
Game Schedule
Now Arranged
All but two of the varsity games this
year will be held at Stanford. The first
game will lie against some U. S. service
team. St. Mary's will then come to
Stanford. Stanford then will play the
Olympic Club at San Francisco. The
strong Pacific fleet team, composed of
many ex-college men, and the Oregon
Aggies will play Stanford here. The
longest trip of the season will be that
to Seattle, where Stanford will play
the University of Washington. The
last contest before the Big Game will
be with the University of Nevada, also
played at Stanford.
The stadium will be. used for the first
time at the Big Game, the other contests
takig place oh the old football field.
More Seats
For Big Game
In years past there has beef! a tre
mendous struggle for seats at the Stan
ford California game- With the stadium
in use, with its 65,000 seats available for
the adherents of the California univer
sities, probably all can be accommodated.
Those who have subscribed to the sta
dium fund will be given preference, in
obtaining tickets through the reserva
tion of blocks of seats on the sides of
the held for their use. %
