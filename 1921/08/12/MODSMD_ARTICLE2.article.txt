# FOOTBALL SCHEDULE FOR FROSH DATES NO CLUB CONTESTS
## Best State High Schools Will Meet Stanford Yearlings During Coming Season 
### 
The Cardinal '25 men will meet
"Pesky" Sprott's Cubs on November
12, according to a schedule released
today from the Graduate Manager's
Office. A new policy has been an
nounced in connection with freshman
competition, to the effect that clubs
will not be dated up in the future.
Games with high school and universi
ty freshman teams will be the only
ones scheduled in the future, as com
petitively, financially and in the mat
ter of arrangement, these men are
more satisfactorily dealt with.
The first freshman game will be
with Palo Alto, October 1. Following
this, Salinas will be rounded up, here,
and then Chico Normal School, at
Chico, October 8 and 15, respectively.
On October 22, either Selma, Bakers
field or San Diego will play in the big
bowl. Bovard field will be visited on
October 29, when the Trojan youths
will meet the Cardinal. When the
frosh squad returns, they will go into
training for November 5, and the Col
lege of Pacific, which may be coached
by "Swede" Righter. This game will
be sure to have all the requirements
of a pre-California contest, since
Righter's reputation as a player is
coast-wide and his ability as a coach
shown in his handling of freshman
baseball this spring.
The big game for the freshmen will
be staged at Berkeley the following
week, Saturday, .November 12. JBy
that time "Pesky" will have taught
them all the slipperiness which made
him famous as half on the much
press-agented Morse "super-eleven."
Duffy Seay will coach the frosh again
this year.
