# DR. E. H. WRAY BOYLE WILL PREACH AGAIN IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### R. D. Boynton, '25 
Students and others who heard Dr.
E. H. Wray Boyle of Denver deliver
his sermon on "Meditation" in the
Stanford Memorial Church, last Sat
urday morning, will be interested to
hear that he is changing his subject
announced for next Sunday morning to
read "The Confession of an Oldtime."
Agnostic."
Dr. Boyle has also submitted to the
acoustic requirements of the univer
! sity church and will preach next Sun
day from the pulpit and not from the
center of the chancel, as he did last!
week, in the hope of being nearer his
audience.
Dr. Boyle was a university preacher
prior to taking his present charge in
the Central Presbyterian Church of
Denver. He was pastor at Lake For
est, 111., where he had a dozfo mil
lionaires in his congregation, and yet
made his church a church for average
men.
The fraternities at Lake Forest
made it a custom to go to church in
a body and had regular pews reserved
for them through the year. Boyle was
a favorite with the student leaders,
who recognized that he was talking
a type of religion that was to be of
definite utility in men's personal rela
tions and social activities.
The sermon last Sunday morning at
the Memorial Church made widespread
impression because it dwelt on the:
fundamental necessity of individual
and solitary thinking by laymen on
religious questions if the church is to
become revitalized. Solitude, he
quoted, is the mother country of the
strong, and independent thought on
the part of strong men will yield re
sults of a new kind of effective religi-
ous aspiration and activity.
