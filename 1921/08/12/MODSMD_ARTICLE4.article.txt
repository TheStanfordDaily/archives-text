# GOLD MEDAL TO BE AWARDED WINNER OF NOVICE PENTATHLON
## All Non-Varsity Men Declared Eligible for Competition; Events Begin This Week 
### 
Coach Maloney's gold medal, which
has been offered to the winner of the
pentathlon, seems to have occasioned
but little competition. Whether lack
of publicity or modest ideas of abili
ties on the part of the contestants
has been the reason for the few
entries, is a speculation. Today will
be the last day for signing up and the
first two events, the javelin and the
broad jump are supposed to be run off
this week. Coach Maloney will be on
hand from 4 to 6 o'clock, this after
noon, to take records. Next week the
discus and high jump will be run off,
and the third week the hundred yard
dash. Maloney will be free on Mon
day, Wednesday and Friday.
This pentathlon is open to all non
varsity men. Not only are the chances
good for any one entering to win the
medal which Coach Maloney has
donated, but the practice and instruc
tion will be valuable for any one hop
ing to make the varsity in coming
quarters.
