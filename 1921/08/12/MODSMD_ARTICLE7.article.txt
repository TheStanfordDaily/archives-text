# DR. STIEGLITZ SAYS DYE INDUSTRY IS WEAPON OF DEFENSE
## Noted Chemist Shows Need of Strong Air Force to Guard Against Surprise Attacks 
### Walter Warren, '22 
"The only defense the nation can
have against a surprise gas attack in
case of war is a superior air fleet. Air
planes and gases used in combination
can wipe out whole populations of the
people htat do not have proper masks
and clothing. Gases can be manu
factured on the quiet in dye factories,
and new gas discoveries can be kept
secret, so that when war breaks out
the possibilities of surprise in gas
attack is very great."
The above is the message of Pro
fessor Julius Stieglitz, of the Univer
sity of Chicago, delivered Tuesday
evening in the Little Theater. The
subject was "the Significance of Chem
istry in the life of the Nation."
Professor Stieglitz asserted that
while we all hope there will be no
more war, the reasonable man will al
ways be ready for defense. Pointing
out the value of the dye industry as
a source of gas and explosives in time
of war, he criticized the shortsighted
ness of Congress in hesitating to make
the industry secure in America.
"The nation that has the greatest
development of chemical industries is
strongest in war because of a greater
supply of war materials, most health
ful, because it has more and better
food, and most wealthy, because It has
more power to exploit the resources of
nature," said Stieglitz.
"Perhaps the most important func
tion of the chemist is in the line of
medicine. The discovery of the drug
cocaine made local surgery possible.
The chemist has discovered other
anaesthetics that make the foundation
of the vast field of modern surgery.
The discovery of the famous drug
"606" has made possible the curing of
blood disease. The importance of this
was shown by the war, when we found
that there were ten million persons
in America who were in need of treat
ment."
Professor Stieglitz pointed out the
great utility of the science of chem
istry in the industrial life of the na
tion. He showed how agriculture is
dependent on the chemist to furnish
food for the plants in the form of
fertilizers, and how the soil analysis
shows the deficiency of any particular
soil for any given purpose.
"Next to agriculture, the steel in
dustry is the greatest industry in
America. It, too, is dependent on
the chemist in all of the stages of the
production of iron and the preparation
of steel, having all of the qualities
anyone can name, except lightness.
Chemists all over the country are now
working on that problem."
Professor Stieglitz asserted and
conclusively proved that the chem
ist has played a leading role in the
progress of man in extending his
power over the materials and forces
of nature.
