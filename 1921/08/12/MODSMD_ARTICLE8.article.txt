# TURF FOR STADIUM MAY BE TAKEN FROM FRONT OF ADMINISTRATION BUILDING Seat Construction Started
## 
### 
An army of carpenters is at
work now on the actual stadium
seat construction, which, on ac
count of the speed that has char
acterized the excavating, may
now be pushed ahead. Miniature
saw mills are busy cutting the
lumber to necessary lengths, and
a few weeks will see the erec
tion of the greater part of the
seats on the east side.
How to have the turf for the
stadium in shape, and yet use the
old turf for the preliminary
games, is a present problem. A
tentative plan is as follows: The
old turf will be left at the old
bleachers, and the earlier games
of the season will be played there
Before the Big Game the turf
in front of the Administration
Building will be moved to the
Stadium, by students during a
University holiday.
