Dr. George Hempl, Professor of
Germanic Philology at Stanford since
190<>, died suddenly at his home in
Palo Alto early Sunday morning. Death
was due to an attack of uraemia from
which Dr. Hempl had suflered for a
number of years. His death was un
expected as he had returned several
days previously from a trip to Yose
mite with Mrs. Hempl and his daugh
ter, Mrs. Frank Hill, and his health
seemed to be improving.
Funeral honors were paid yesterday.
Professor A. T. Murray conducted the
simple service at the Hempl home,
reading Bible selections and two
poems, and paying a personal tribute
to the life and work of Dr. Hempl.
He also led the brief service at the
grave.
Pallbearers, all colleagues of Dr.
Hempl on the Stanford faculty, were
Professors E. D. Adams, George J.
Peirce, L. L. Burlingame, W. A.i
Cooper, J. S. P. Tatlock and B. O.
Foster. Interment took place at Alta
Mesa.
Dr. Hempl was born in Whitewater,
Wis., June 6th, 1859. Upon gradu
ating from the University of Michi
gan in 1579 he was appointed princi
pal of a high school in Saginaw, Mich.,
and afterwards in La Porte, Ind. In
1884 he accepted an instructorship in
German at Johns Hopkins University,
which he retained for two years. He
then devotel several years to gradu
ate study at Gottingen, Tiibungen,
Strassbourg, Berlin, and Jena. He re
ceived liis doctor's degree at Jena in
1889.
Returning home Dr. Hempl was
made Assistant Professor ot' English
at his Alma Mater. After several pro
motions he was appointed Professor of
English Philology and General Lingu
istics, in 1897. Dr. Hempl held this
position until he came to Stanford in
1906. He received the honorary de
gree of Doctor of Laws from the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, in 1904.
Dr. Hempl was President of the
American Dialect Society from 1900
to 1905, of the Modern Language Asso
ciation in 1902 and 1903, and of the
American Philological Association in
1903 and 1904. For many years he was
a member of the Simplified Spelling
Board, his interest in the subject aris
ing from his studies in phonetics and
pronunciation.
Dr. Hempl was a nationally recog
nized authority on the alphabet and
old Greek and Latin inscriptions.

While studying the development of
the language of the Burgundian Runes
he made discoveries which enabled
him to decipher Venetic and Estru
scan. ancient Italian dialects which
had baffled all previous attempts at
reading. By some method he read
the Phaestos Disc from the Island of
Crete which proved to be older than
any type of Greek hitherto known.
He had hardly deciphered this when
he found Hittite inscriptions on the
same island and was able to prove
that language to be of Greek stock.
Realizing that his eyesight was fail
ing Dr. Hempl pushed ahead persist
ently into new fields, taking little time
to publish his findings, with the result
that most of his work is in manuscript
form, although practically ready for
the publisher. Beside papers in vari
ous philological periodicals his pub
lished works include, Old English
Philology (1892), Chaucer's Pronuncia
tion (1893), German Orthography
and Phonology (1897), and a Phonetic
Text of Wilhelm Tell (1900).
Besides his widow, Dr. Hempl is sur
vived by two daughters, Mrs. Frank
Ernest Hill, and Mrs. Edmund Heller,
both of whom are married to Stan
ford graduates.
