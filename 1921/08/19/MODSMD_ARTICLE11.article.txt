# MRS. JORDAN TELLS STORY OF STANFORD FOR FIRST DECADE
## Reads Chapter of Chancellor's Autobiography Honoring Founders of the University 
### 
"Stanford University from 1893 to
1891) was the title of the chapter of
Chancellor Jordan's Autobiography
read Tuesday evening, by Mrs. Jor
dan, in the Little Theater. The read
ing was a narrative of the life of Gov
ernor Stanford, and a tribute to Mrs.
Stanford for her courage in the
struggles to keep the University alive
during the years immediately follow
ing Governor Stanford's death.
Most of the chapter read by Mrs.
Stanford has appeared in nearly the
same form in "The Cardinal" for Janu
ary 1921, and in the "Illustrated Re
view," for March, 1920, through the
courtesy of Dr. and Mrs. Jordan, and
the publishers. The Autobiography
has been written and partially revised
up to the time of Dr. Jordan's trip to
Europe in the early days of the war.
Leland Stanford was born in New
York State, in 1824. He received his
early education at Cazenovia Academy,
and later studied law. After his
marriage to Jane Latlirop, in ISSO, he
moved westward to Wisconsin, and
later to California. He kept a general
merchandise store in a mining camp
for a time, then moved to Sacramento
and resumed the practice of law. He
soon became prominent in politics, and
was elected Governor in 1861. He was
a close friend and helper of Lincoln
during the days of the Civil War. He
was elected United States Senator in
18S5, and served in this capacity until
his death in 1893.
Governor Stanford's work in build
ing the first transcontinental railway,
the Central Pacific, was among his
most noteworthy contributions to the
welfare of the State and Nation.
Later he and his associates built the
Southern Pacific, which absorbed the
earlier line.
"Leland Stanford's far-reaching in
fluence never rested wholly or even
mainly on wealth. His simplicity of
life kept him always in touch with the
people. Broad minded and long
headed, he was a keen observer of
human nature. His secretary said of
him. 'He was active when other men
were idle; he was generous when
other men were grasping; he was
lofty when other men were base.' His
primary concepts involved individual
ism in education, early choice of a
profession, and broad-based specializa
tion along some particular line."
Governor Stanford's sudden death by
apoplexy threw the administration of
his estate into the jurisdiction of the
Probate Court, at the beginning of the
severe financial panic of the early '90s.
It was then that Mrs. Stanford revel
ed a marvelous strength of character
by the sacrifice she made to keep
the University running.
"It was Mr. Stanford's purpose, and
that of his wife, to give the whole of
their estate—about $35,000,000—t0 the
University. Because of two disheart
ening obstacles, this was brought
about, only after eight years of per
sistent effort. These obstacles in
brief were, first, the legal necessity
of clearing the estate of all obliga
tions, and second, a defect in the en
abling act of the State Legislature, on
which the endowment grant rested."
While the will was in probate the
panic of 1893 came on. All incomes
ceased. Everything was at a stand
still at the University. Salaries could
not be paid. Nevertheless, Mrs. Stan
ford determined, in spite of opposing
advice, to keep the University open.
She turned over the meager allowance
granted her by the court for household
expenses to be paid on the salaries of
professors.
Finally the troubles began to melt
away, when the United States Gov
ernment brought an injunction to pre

vent the distribution of the Stanford
•state, demanding fifteen millions as
Stanford's share of a government loan
to the Central Pacific, not due for sev
eral years. The case had to be taken
to the United States Supreme Court
for final settlement, where the suit
was thrown out by a unanimous de
cision.
"Thus was surmounted the greatest,
though by no means the last, obstacle
of the University's first decade."

"Stanford University from 1893 to
1891) was the title of the chapter of
Chancellor Jordan's Autobiography
read Tuesday evening, by Mrs. Jor
dan, in the Little Theater. The read
ing was a narrative of the life of Gov
ernor Stanford, and a tribute to Mrs.
Stanford for her courage in the
struggles to keep the University alive
during the years immediately follow
ing Governor Stanford's death.
Most of the chapter read by Mrs.
Stanford has appeared in nearly the
same form in "The Cardinal" for Janu
ary 1921, and in the "Illustrated Re
view," for March, 1920, through the
courtesy of Dr. and Mrs. Jordan, and
the publishers. The Autobiography
has been written and partially revised
up to the time of Dr. Jordan's trip to
Europe in the early days of the war.
Leland Stanford was born in New
York State, in 1824. He received his
early education at Cazenovia Academy,
and later studied law. After his
marriage to Jane Latlirop, in ISSO, he
moved westward to Wisconsin, and
later to California. He kept a general
merchandise store in a mining camp
for a time, then moved to Sacramento
and resumed the practice of law. He
soon became prominent in politics, and
was elected Governor in 1861. He was
a close friend and helper of Lincoln
during the days of the Civil War. He
was elected United States Senator in
18S5, and served in this capacity until
his death in 1893.
Governor Stanford's work in build
ing the first transcontinental railway,
the Central Pacific, was among his
most noteworthy contributions to the
welfare of the State and Nation.
Later he and his associates built the
Southern Pacific, which absorbed the
earlier line.
"Leland Stanford's far-reaching in
fluence never rested wholly or even
mainly on wealth. His simplicity of
life kept him always in touch with the
people. Broad minded and long
headed, he was a keen observer of
human nature. His secretary said of
him. 'He was active when other men
were idle; he was generous when
other men were grasping; he was
lofty when other men were base.' His
primary concepts involved individual
ism in education, early choice of a
profession, and broad-based specializa
tion along some particular line."
Governor Stanford's sudden death by
apoplexy threw the administration of
his estate into the jurisdiction of the
Probate Court, at the beginning of the
severe financial panic of the early '90s.
It was then that Mrs. Stanford revel
ed a marvelous strength of character
by the sacrifice she made to keep
the University running.
"It was Mr. Stanford's purpose, and
that of his wife, to give the whole of
their estate—about $35,000,000—t0 the
University. Because of two disheart
ening obstacles, this was brought
about, only after eight years of per
