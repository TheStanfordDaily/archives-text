# Prompt Action on Part of Zeta Psi Boarders Averts Conflagration
## 
### 
A lighted match in the dry grass
near the Zeta Psi house, yesterday,
started a hungry fire, which fanned
by the breeze, threatened to burn as
far as the President's home, unless
drastic measures were used. They
were. A volunteer fire department,
armed with pillows, shovels, sacks,
rakes, and matresses heroically risked
their eyebrows in whipping it out.
"Scotch" Adams bravely directed their
efforts from the front porch. "Red"
Tibbens acted as field marshal, his
violent complexion and flaming hair
spurring his men to great deeds of
valor. The fire was put out before
damage other than singed whiskers
and hair was done.
