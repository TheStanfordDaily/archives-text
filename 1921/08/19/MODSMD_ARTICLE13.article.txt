# 'BELINDA' EASILY SCORES BIG SUCCESS OF SUMMER STAGE
## Florence Locke, Gordon Davis and L. E. Seib Take Honors in A. A. Milne Production 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
Possibly the advertisements did lie.
It wasn't a delightful show, it was
startling! The combination of splendid
acting and charming script could be
nothing less. "Belinda" has set a
standard which (he Davis productions
of the future will find it hard to live
up to. Even with the violin inter
ludes, which were more fitted for a
jazz orchestra than a semi-solo, the
evening was a great success. Con
gratulations to A. A. Milne, Gordon
Davis and the cast.
The elegant egoist was Belinda Tre
mayne. She was one of the beautiful
who knew their beauty and are none
the worse for it. Elegant is advised,
for, as an illustration of clothes as an
aid to physical charm, Florence Locke
was splendid. The whole action seem
ed handled by her as simply as she
did the men, all of whom loved her.
It really does take some talent to be
loved in a garden and a drawing room
at once, and Belinda was all of that,
and more, she could talk of butcher
shops and food in the same breath as
poetry and get away with it. In
truth, Belinda was everything Mr.
Milne intended her to be, a uniquely
frank and whimsical creature.
Davis and Seib
Play Foolish Lovers
Seib and Davis ably held up the
Stanford prestige. Davis, in his first
character role, was utterly devoid of
artificiality and demonstrated that a
good coach can be a good actor as
well. With his enormous side-burns,
bowler hat and precision, he so far
surpassed his performance in the
"Yellow Jacket," that the person who
would again cast him as a juvenile
would be a fit subject to include in
the statistics of the lise of insanity
in Santa Clara county. Davis' inter
pretation of the faltering, peculiar
scientist was faultless and enjoyable.
Seib was the other extreme—in
character. His poetical fancy was so
lightly turned to thoughts of love that
he fell for exactly two thirds of the
female characters and no doubt would
have adored the other had she been
quicker at admitting him. If not im
partial, what? To say that Claude
Devonnish wrote for a living would
be an injustice for if he had not
in love it is doubtful that he ever
would have had lived, much less on
lamb chops. In fact, the performance
of these two Stanford men seems to
call for an opportunity to Cardinalize
the Little Theatre movement as they
have at Berkeley. Here is the ideal
talent and here the ideal place. They
were both knockouts.
The other male in the cast was in
troduced under false pretenses. Some
body actually apologised for Arthur
Cyril before the show. If Cyril didn't
know the lines he improvised such a
good set that he is to be congratulated
as twice talented. In his part as the
moderate man of good sound sense and
affairs he was very effective and had
a decidedly elevating influence.
Delia, played by Emma Knox, was
strong in the role of Delia Tremayne,
but a bit inclined towards monotono
in her acting. Perhaps after a de
cade or so of equal suffrage people will
be used to such determined assertion
but nowadays it is but boresome in
Miss Knox to indulge in drab "cute"
independence. There is pextness and
pertness.
Genevieve Butterfield played Betty
easily, always seeming successful in
picking the correct callers and ap
pearing respectable, which is about
all she had to do.
The set was a very simple one, of
gray drapes and essential furniture,
not distracting by its mock reality
from the vividness of the characteriza
tion.
The music was well rendered by
Dick Malaby, assisted by Howard
Scheib.

body actually apologised for Arthur
Cyril before the show. If Cyril didn't
know the lines he improvised such a
good set that he is to be congratulated
as twice talented. In his part as the
moderate man of good sound sense and
affairs he was very effective and had
a decidedly elevating influence.
Delia, played by Emma Knox, was
strong in the role of Delia Tremayne,
but a bit inclined towards monotono
in her acting. Perhaps after a de
cade or so of equal suffrage people will
be used to such determined assertion
but nowadays it is but boresome in
Miss Knox to indulge in drab "cute"
independence. There is pextness and
pertness.
Genevieve Butterfield played Betty
easily, always seeming successful in
picking the correct callers and ap
pearing respectable, which is about
all she had to do.
The set was a very simple one, of
gray drapes and essential furniture,
not distracting by its mock reality
from the vividness of the characteriza
tion.
The music was well rendered by
Dick Malaby, assisted by Howard
Scheib.
Possibly the advertisements did lie.
It wasn't a delightful show, it was
startling! The combination of splendid
acting and charming script could be
nothing less. "Belinda" has set a
standard which (he Davis productions
of the future will find it hard to live
up to. Even with the violin inter
ludes, which were more fitted for a
jazz orchestra than a semi-solo, the
evening was a great success. Con
gratulations to A. A. Milne, Gordon
Davis and the cast.
The elegant egoist was Belinda Tre
mayne. She was one of the beautiful
who knew their beauty and are none
the worse for it. Elegant is advised,
for, as an illustration of clothes as an
aid to physical charm, Florence Locke
was splendid. The whole action seem
ed handled by her as simply as she
did the men, all of whom loved her.
It really does take some talent to be
loved in a garden and a drawing room
at once, and Belinda was all of that,
and more, she could talk of butcher
shops and food in the same breath as
poetry and get away with it. In
truth, Belinda was everything Mr.
Milne intended her to be, a uniquely
frank and whimsical creature.
Davis and Seib
Play Foolish Lovers
Seib and Davis ably held up the
Stanford prestige. Davis, in his first
character role, was utterly devoid of
artificiality and demonstrated that a
good coach can be a good actor as
well. With his enormous side-burns,
bowler hat and precision, he so far
surpassed his performance in the
"Yellow Jacket," that the person who
would again cast him as a juvenile
would be a fit subject to include in
the statistics of the lise of insanity
in Santa Clara county. Davis' inter
pretation of the faltering, peculiar
scientist was faultless and enjoyable.
Seib was the other extreme—in
character. His poetical fancy was so
lightly turned to thoughts of love that
he fell for exactly two thirds of the
female characters and no doubt would
have adored the other had she been
quicker at admitting him. If not im
partial, what? To say that Claude
Devonnish wrote for a living would
be an injustice for if he had not
in love it is doubtful that he ever
would have had lived, much less on
lamb chops. In fact, the performance
of these two Stanford men seems to
call for an opportunity to Cardinalize
the Little Theatre movement as they
have at Berkeley. Here is the ideal
talent and here the ideal place. They
were both knockouts.
The other male in the cast was in
troduced under false pretenses. Some
