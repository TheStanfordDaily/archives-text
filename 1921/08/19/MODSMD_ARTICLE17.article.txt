# ENTRANCE CARDS
## 
### 
A great amount of discussion and uncertainty among summer fresh
men who expect to attend Stanford during the fall quarter has arisen
with the distribution by the Registrar's office of a certain number of
"blue" cards. These cards received by students with less than fifteen
hours recommended high school units, inform recipients that they are
reasonably sure of admission, inasmuch as their work to date has been
satisfactory, and units made this summer may be used toward making up
the deficiency in recommended entrance units.
The fact that a student has not received a blue card does not signify
that he will not be admitted. If jiis work at the end of the present
quarter indicates his ability to measure up to Stanford scholastic require
ments. he may be admitted at that time.
The receipt of the card does not assure admission unconditionally.
It indicates that work to date has been satisfactory. A subsequent
delinquency this quarter may disqualify students who have them.
Further, if an unexpectedly large number of full fifteen-entrance credit
applicants for admission send in credentials before the fall quarter,
possibly some who now have blue cards and less than the fifteen credits
may be crowded out. At present the entrance committee believes that
all who have the blue cards, and a number of others here now who com
plete a satisfactory quarter's work, may be admitted.
