# New American School To Be Built in Shanghai
## 
### 
Plans were taking form through the
summer in Shanghai, where Stanford
is supporting E. Lockwood as Y. M.
C. A. Secretary, to open a campaign
in the fall to raise a final 150,000 taels
to begin work on the erection of the
first building of the new American
school. These first structures, consist
ing of a class room building and a
dormitory on the ground, will cost
approximately 467,000 taels, or about
$330,000 in gold. Of the 467,000 taels
required, 324,000 have been raised,
107,000 taels having been given in a
campaign for funds held in Shanghai
last year and $150,000 gold having
been contributed by mission boards in
the United States.
It has been planned to make the
new school a center of American
community life in Shanghai. The site
that has been selected is a tract of
about 17 acres located admirably in
the French concession.
