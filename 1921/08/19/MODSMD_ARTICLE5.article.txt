## Pick Able Stanford Menâ€”--Say Speakers 
### Wylie Kilpatrick 
Three hundred men stormed ap
proval when Walter Powell last night
asserted that the California eleven
"might be beaten and would be beaten"
if every ounce of Stanford strength
is thrown into the gridiron struggle
next fall. The statement of the Ath
letic Director was made before an
athletic rally held in the clubroom of
Encina Hall, the first rally of the 1921
season to be held on the campus. Wil
liam Fletcher, Sidney Grossman, and
William Leiser followed the athletic
director with short talks on the Stan
ford situation.
Powell made a strong appeal to the

freshmen to select a student activity
in which they would consistently work
and aid in making Stanford the pre
mier university of the West. Schol
astically, Stanford is unequalled in
the West," declared the coach, ''and
we have the men here who can give
her the same position in athletics."
Powell was caustic in his condemna
tion of the "jazz-hound" who is more
eager to secure the mythical "snake
S" than to make a varsity team. He
also pointed out that the automobile
has 110 place with men who would
add to Stanford athletic achievement.
The new graduate manager, Bill
Fletcher, made a brief speech, outlin
ing the plans he has prepared since
assuming the managership. He dis
cussed the manager plan for govern
ing the various sports. Fletcher, a
Stanford graduate of the 1911 class,
related a number of interesting anec
dotes concerning athletics of a de
cade ago.
Sidney Grossman, '23, spoke of the
student viewpoint and hope for next
year, and asked co-operation of the
men present. "In September you will
l.e home," Grossman said, "and will
have an excellent opportunity to in
form high school friends of Stanford."
Loispr. concluding the rally, spoke
of ways in which freshmen only one
quarter in the University can aid
Stanford. He declared the prospective
Stanford man must be of all-round
capability, able to compete success
fully with the greater athletes of the
country, and able to keep company
with the best students as well. He
pointed out that Stanford does not
indulge in cheap propaganda as she
neither desires nor has the capacity
to handle a larger student body. "Stan
ford selects her own students," he de
clared, "but in selecting them she
must choose those whose attitude and
potential ability warrant belief that
thav will develop into true Stanford
men."
