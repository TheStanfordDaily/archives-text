# SOCCER SQUAD WILL MEET OLYMPIC CLUB HERE ON AUGUST 27
## 
### 
Over thirty men are appearing regu
larly on the soccer field for practice this
summer, developing a team that will
probably meet the Olympic Club a week
from Saturday. Coach Harry Maloney,
assisted by several of last year's varsity
men, is developing the nucleus of a for
midable. squad for next season.
Believing that work in actual compe
tition is the best way to learn soccer,
Coach Maloney has divided the squad
into two teams, one being from the
upper classmen and the other represting
the freshmen. Although the upper
classmen number several varsity soccer
players among their ranks, the fast and
aggressive frosh aggregation has been
able to run them off in some of the
matches that have been played so far.
