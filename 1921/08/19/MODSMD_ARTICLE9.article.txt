### 
Entertaining a hundred guests from
San Francisco, Berkeley and San Jose,
the. Associated Federal Students lield
their second annual barbecue last Satur
day afternoon in the Sycamore grove in
Frenchman's Gap. About 165 persons
were present.
Aviators Davis and Birney furnished
the most spectacular part of the enter
tainment by their airplane stunts and
passenger-carrying flights. Both men
are experienced army aviators. They
have recently purchased a Curtiss ma
chine., and will soon open the Stanford
Flying School, giving instructions to
Stanford students and residents of the
Bay districts.
The barbecue proper was a source of
enthusiastic comment to all who tasted
Ed Wells' feast. Steaks, roasting ears,
pickles, coffee and doughnuts made up
the menu.
Elmer Shirrell, D. V. O. of the
twelfth district, told of the proposed re
organization of the Federal Board under
the Sweet bill, uniting the Federal Board
with the Veterans' Welfare Board. He
asked the men to have patience with the
delays in pay and other matters caused
by the reorganiaztion. He said that
more applications for vocational training
had been received during the last month
than for any other month since the
board was created. This is an indication
of the growing importance of vocational
training, lie said.
The married women demonstrated un
questioned athletic superiority over the
single women in the games of the after
noon, taking the one inning baseball
game by the overwhelming score of 20
to 0. The married men also appeared
to have a slight advantage over their
unmarried "buddies."'
