We are pleased to announce a very material
reduction in the price of our candies.
This reduction which averages about twenty
per cent, brings candy prices down to prac
tically the pre-war level.
We have taken this action independently, and
regardless of the fact that labor costs have
remained the same, and materials costs have
been but slightly reduced.
