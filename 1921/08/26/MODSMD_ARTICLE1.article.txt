# LAUGHTER, WIT, AND HUMOR SUBJECT OF DR. H. L. STEWART
## Dalhousie College Professor Discusses Causes of Mirth In Last Tuesday Lecture 
### 
"Man has not only been called the
'rational animal,' but also the 'laugh
ing animal,'" declared Dr. Herbert
Leslie Stewart in his lecture on
"Laughter, Wit, and Humor," Tuesday
evening, at the Little Theater.
The speaker discussed and outlined
the common varieties of mirth â€”the
babies' chuckle, the hysterical and un
controllable giggle of the schoolgirl,
the hypocritical simper of society
ladies, and the ecclesiastical, beatific
face of the clergyman on a parish visit.
But Dr. Stewart said that to him the
most honest, jovial and heartfelt laugh
was that of the fat person.
"We constant think of Humor in
place of Wit," declared Dr. Stewart,
"but a distinction should be made
here." The speaker cited as an ex
ample of wit the case of the Irish
general in Louis XlV's army, who,
when that sovereign, becoming tired
of the general's repeated requests for
advancement, angrily exclaimed "That
man is the most troublesome fellow in
the army" replied, "Precisely what our
enemies think, sir."
Incongruity, the ludicrous, the ridi
culous, and surprise were named by
the speaker as being the base of most
mirth. Alone or on combination these
! elements cause inost of the world's
laughter.
"The Germans are not good humor
ists, because they lay the whole em
phasis 011 surprise." The German
writers maintain that humor may be
summed up in the illustration of the
tangent meeting the circle. That the
tangent does not pursue the curve of
the circle, but touches it and then
keeps going, is considered by them to
have the element of surprise essential
to their idea of humor.
Dr. Stewart is professor of Philo
sophy at Dalhousie University, Hali
fax. He is one of the visiting pro
fessors on the Stanford summer quar
ter faculty.
