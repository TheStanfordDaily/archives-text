# CURIOSITY'S PLACE IN LIFE TOLD BY DR. GEORGE PIERCE
## 
### 
"Curiosity of Intelligence,, at the
final meeting of the Graduate Student
Association for the Summer Quarter
was held last night at the Women's
Club House. Ninety-five attended.
Dr. George Jaines Pierce spoke. Pierce
is Professor of Botany and Plant
Physiology at Stanford.
The subject of the lecture was
"Curiosity of Intelligence" and the
topic was developed from a treatment
of the "curiosity" of the senses, which
brings messages to the brain, to obser
vations of "curiosity" of the brain it
self. Doctor Pierce stated that the
driving power of men's intelligence
was "curiosity" which leads men on
into new discoveries. He said "curi
osity" begins in children and if par
ents will stimulate it and cultivate it
the child will grow much more rapid
ly mentally than if left. *o itself. After
pointing out that one should early in
life find their major "curiosity" and
follow it as a business or profession,
Doctor Pierce explained the necessity
of keeping alive the "curiosity" in
other fields. He stated that he had
observed that frequently there was
little "curiosity" about the things near
at hand and that the individual imagin
ed all interesting things were far
away. He called attention to the possi
bilities of stimulating and satisfying
intelligent "curiosity" at Stanford by
visits to the Art Gallery. Museum,
campus woods and flower gardens, at
tendance on the Tuesday night Little
Theater lectures, ilif. Memorial Church j
services and organ recitals, and by j
entry with enthusiasm into student 1
and university activities. Doctor Pierce
stated that similar avenues would be
found in every community for the ex
ercise of intelligent "curiosity", and
that the student of the University en
gaged in graduate study and research
was peculiarly fitted, not only to grow
himself, but to stimulate community
"curiosity" in all lines of community
betterment. Doctor Pierce pointed
out that just as individuals grow in in
telligence by the rational exercise and I
satisfaction of "curiosity," so do com- j
munities, the nation, and the race |
grow in civilization in proportion to j
their "curiosity" and the degree of
intelligence shown in its exercise.

"Curiosity of Intelligence,, at the
final meeting of the Graduate Student
Association for the Summer Quarter
was held last night at the Women's
Club House. Ninety-five attended.
Dr. George Jaines Pierce spoke. Pierce
is Professor of Botany and Plant
Physiology at Stanford.
The subject of the lecture was
"Curiosity of Intelligence" and the
topic was developed from a treatment
of the "curiosity" of the senses, which
brings messages to the brain, to obser
vations of "curiosity" of the brain it
self. Doctor Pierce stated that the
driving power of men's intelligence
was "curiosity" which leads men on
into new discoveries. He said "curi
osity" begins in children and if par
ents will stimulate it and cultivate it
the child will grow much more rapid
ly mentally than if left. *o itself. After
pointing out that one should early in
life find their major "curiosity" and
follow it as a business or profession,
Doctor Pierce explained the necessity
of keeping alive the "curiosity" in
other fields. He stated that he had
observed that frequently there was
little "curiosity" about the things near
at hand and that the individual imagin
ed all interesting things were far
away. He called attention to the possi
bilities of stimulating and satisfying
intelligent "curiosity" at Stanford by
visits to the Art Gallery. Museum,
campus woods and flower gardens, at
tendance on the Tuesday night Little
Theater lectures, ilif. Memorial Church j
services and organ recitals, and by j
entry with enthusiasm into student 1
and university activities. Doctor Pierce
stated that similar avenues would be
found in every community for the ex
ercise of intelligent "curiosity", and
that the student of the University en
gaged in graduate study and research
was peculiarly fitted, not only to grow
himself, but to stimulate community
"curiosity" in all lines of community
betterment. Doctor Pierce pointed
out that just as individuals grow in in
telligence by the rational exercise and I
satisfaction of "curiosity," so do com- j
munities, the nation, and the race |
grow in civilization in proportion to j
their "curiosity" and the degree of
intelligence shown in its exercise.
