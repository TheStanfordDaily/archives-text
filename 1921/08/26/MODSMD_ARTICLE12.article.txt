## 
### 
The current history test given by Pro
fessor E. H. Lutz elicited some new con
clusions on men, places, and current his
tory in general. Of the 155 who took
the test 9 received A's, 40 pe.r cent B's
and C's, 30 per cent D's, and the remain
ing 24 per cent failed.
The research revealed: That John
Burroughs was the inventor of the. add
ing machine; that D'Annunzio was Pres
ident of Italy; that Mme. Curie is a
French actress; that Dr. Simons, the
German statesman, is an automobile
manufacturer; that Henry Cabot Lodge
is the speaker of the House, of Repre
sentatives; that Costa Rica is an island
in the West Indies; that Geneva was the
seat of the Peace Conference; and that
Mesopotamia is in Europe-
One student said that the Big Four at
the peace conference were Wilson, Lloyd
George, Yiviani, and "Mirandy"; an
other defined "collective bargaining" as
where, several get together to bargain;
a third believed that the last amendment
to the Constitution abolished slavery;
K said that three pledges of the
new administration were "Hoover,
Hughes, and Mellon." When asked how
much the governments associated with
us in the war owe our government, a
student answered, "Germany owes us a
considerable amount."
These, however, are the freak answers
out of the 155 papers, and Professor
Lutz says that on the whole the class
did very well.
