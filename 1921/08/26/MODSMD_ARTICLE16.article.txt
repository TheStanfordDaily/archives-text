Summer freshmen have probably heard about the honor system

with it in the first and only brief mention of that system it has made
editorially this quarter.
Stanford men do not talk of unimportant things, nor of proposi
tions in which they are not sincere. The, great emphasis placed on the
honor system this summer was because of the exacting necessity that
that system work this summer without fault. Stanford possibly would
not be the worse today for not having tried the honor system, lint to
trv it and fail would be disgrace.
Such a system, used by the University, must be practiced the year
round, when conditions are more favorable, and when less so. I hey
are least so in the summer period.
Yet summer students are perfectly capable of working a real honor
system, and they are expected to handle the coming final examinations
as reasonable and able men and women. The summer students will then
have proved beyond, for all time, that the Stanford honor system is
I'rmlv and definitely established.

THE SUMMER DAILY has been published but once a week, and
with but live short columns of news, in order to eat as little as possible
from the expense budget, and to leave for the Daily Polo Alto of the tall

ford is generally considered not very strong, but her prospects are mate
rially improving every day. California is at her mightiest. There is a
great story in the five major contests of the next college year.
