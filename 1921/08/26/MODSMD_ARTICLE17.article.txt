San Francisco, Aug. 14, 1921.
Dear Editor: —
1 ran into some Stanfordites the
other day, who were having the time
of their lives with "moonshine." I
wonder if you people down there rea
lize the toll of moonshine.
Somewhere in a San Francisco hos
pital. ,a young girl lies paralyzed,
counting the hours before death
comes to her. Two days ago, wealth,
health and the future were her's. A
graduate of an eastern finishing school,
daughter of an old New England
family, she had come here on a visit.
A party was held in her honor the
other night, and to add to the festivi
ties, one of the young men brought
a flask of some specially "Good Old
Burgundy." Today she is dying, while
some of her play companions face life
paralyzed.
How does this interest you and me?
Because I happen to know friends of
the girl- and because you may be
anticipating sharing in her fate.
"Moonshine" is a word lightly hand
led. but deadly in effect.
Let's stop a moment and consider
how real distilled liquor was made in
the "good old days." U. S. laws re
quired that all distilled liquors should
pass through three separate charcoal
refiners to exterminate the poisonous
fusel oil. Hut they did not stop there.
Records at the custom house show
that this liquor mustt be placed in
charred barrels for 48 months, in a
bonded warehouse, before it could be
bottled for use as a beverage. For
medicinal purposes —24 months was
sufficient.
Compare this system with that of
our modern moonshiner.
Captain Arthur Layne. of the Cen
tral Police Station, tells we that the
majority of moonshiners are ex-con
victs. To supply the 3800 bootlegging
establishments in San Francisco our
worthy moonshiner goes into the
wholesale district, and at o'clock in
the morning collects the rotten fruit,
cabbage and cauliflower leaves that
decorate the streets. Packed in dirty
barrels, he carts away this refuse to

from the basis for the "sour mash."
To add the necessary sugar he ob
tains the dregs from the sugar re
fineries —a waste which up to the last
year had proven worthless. Placed in
a dark, damp cellar, away from the
eye of the police, the mash is allowed
to ferment. Then it is poured into
copper boilers, in the top of which
a small hole has been cut. A long
rubber hose, attached to this hole,
ends in a demijohn.
Mr. Moonshiner light his gas at
night, and the distilling process be
gins. The alcohol passes out into
steam and ends in the demijohn. It
is hardly cold when the bootlegger is
selling it.
Now, most anybody knows that fun
gus collects 011 fruit while it is fer
menting. To safeguard it,
the smallest brewer employed a train
ed chemist to detect and destroy the
fungius. He had to, by order of the
U. S. government. The moonshiner
knows little about the fungus and its
deadly effect, and cares less. So
while the mash is merrily boiling away
the fungus is being boiled into the
vapor of the alcohol.
But a customer may refuse the
colorless moonshine and demands
some good old Burgundy. The ac
commodating bootlegger gets the
flavor and coloring of each favored
"spirit" from an eastern house. He
bottles his concoction of moonshine
plus flavor, plus color, places a regular
name on the bottle, and to cap it all,
seats it with the U. S. seal, duly
forged signature stating that this
liquor was bonded 1912, and bottled
1921.
It was some of this "1912" Burgundy
that claimed toll of the young people
I mentioned.
Because moonshine is so deadly,
the bootlegger quite considerately di
lutes it —for his own protection. He
does not want his customers to become
paralyzed or die in his place.
Blindness, paralysis, death and all
sorts of tragic diseases result from
"moonshine" and "raisin wine.' Look
up the records at the police courts, at
the coroners, and at the hospitals.
Raisin wine contains less fungius,
but a great deal of fusel oil, which

is just as deadly, and for which the
U, s. government endeavored to guard
against, in the "good old days."
So 1 ask —Is it worth wlyle? Sac
rifice your future and life for a mo
mentary pleasure?
