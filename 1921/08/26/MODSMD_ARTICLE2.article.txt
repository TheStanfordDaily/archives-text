# STANFORD FRESHMEN PLAY OLYMPIC CLUB SOCCER SATURDAY
## 
### 
Saturday, at 3.30 p.m. the Stanford
freshmen will play the Olympic Club
soccer team. The contest will be
staged on the soccer field, the outfield
of the baseball diamond. Under the
able coaching of James Quinby, who
has devoted much time and effort to
the work, the Frosh have developed
for faster than was expected, and
hope to beat the club team. The
Olympic team took second places in
the California Soccer Association last
year, and although the winged "O"
men are all skilled veterans, the
Frosh have been training hard, and
should give them a stiff battle. The
Cardinal babes will line up as follows:
Forwards —Hays, Hall, Maynard,
Meza, Millea.
Hacks —Marsh, Baugh, Foster, Jer
gens, Harger.
Goal —Rogers.
Substitutes —Andrews, Taylor, Mul
ler.
Meza, at inside right, has been the
most consistent scorer among the for
wards, and is a good shot. Ray Baugh,
in center half, is one of the best play
ers that summer practice has deve
loped. If the frosh keep improving as
they have recently, and do not lose
players to the American game, they
will very probably win the California
series this fall.
