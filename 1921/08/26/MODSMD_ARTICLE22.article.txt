# REORGANIZATION OF CALIFORNIA SOCCER LEAGUE COMPLETED
## 
### 
Complete reorganization of the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League oc
curred at the last meeting of the Cali
fornia Socce.r Football League. Several
new teams will probably make their ap
pearance in the Saturday circuit next
season, and as a whole it is expected
that the league will be a great deal
stronger than it was last year.
Maloney and Browne were elected to
executive chairman and vice-president,
respectively.
The following colleges and clubs will
compose, the organization, with possibly
two additions: Stanford University,
University of California, Olympic Club,
Fremont Post No. 52, American Legion,
Italia-Virtus Club, and the Young
Men's Hebrew Association. Last year
the Chinese Y. M. C. A. and the Co
lumbia Club held the places now oc
cupied by the Y. M. H. A. and the
American Legion, but as both these
teams proved "weaker sisters," they had
a hard time negotiating the entire sea
son, and the Columbia elven was forced
to drop out of the league before the sea
son was over.
This year every indication points to
a hard fought year. The Italian Club
will have a greatly strengthened outfit in

the Field, and the local American Legion
eleven, which afforded plenty of com
petition for the league leaders last sea
son, will once again be in the offing.
Should the other two clubs gain admit
tance to the University and Club League
the organization will be running 011 a
larger scale than ever before.
Officers of the league elected at the
meeting include the following: William
Campbell, president; Professor F. Klee
berger, Dr. A. D. Browne, W. F. Hum
phrey, and G. Ferrero, vice-presidents;
Harry W. Maloney, chairman of the ex
ecutive committee, and Lynn Reynolds,
secretary.
