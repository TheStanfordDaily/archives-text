# BASKETBALL PAVILION AND NEW UNION AGAIN BEING PUSHED FORWARD
## 
### 
A new arcade will connect the I
J Stanford Union (old) with the I
Women's Clubhouse, leaving a ,
large court between these two
buildings and in front of the
new Union building.
Both the Basketball Pavilion
and the new Union are now pro
gressing materially in construc
tion. About fifteen bricklayers
and a number of laborers are
now actively engaged in con
structing the new home for the
Stanford Five, across from En
cina. The walls on one side are
about one story high. Steel
trusses for the roof have arrived,
and will soon be in place.
The molds for the Union
arcade are in place, and before
long that, too, will be in con
crete form.
