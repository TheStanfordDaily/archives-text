# AUSTRALIAN RUGGERS VISIT THE CAMPUS EN ROUTE TO ENGLAND
## "Wonderful! May Australasia Have One Like It," Manager Exclaims at the Bowl 
### 
Australasia's picked rugby players,
selected from New Zeafand, Queens
land, and New South Wales, reached
San Francisco Monday morning on
their way to England, where they will
play against England's best ruggers.
The tour will require nine months,
ending with a three-game series for
the international rugby championship
between England and Australasia.
When some 10()i miles out of San
Francisco, an invitation was wired
them to be guests of Stanford. Upon
arrival the South Sea ruggers were
met by Assistant Athletic Manager
Davis, and escorted to the campus
after which Comptroller Roth, Dean
of Men Culver and Athletic Manager
Fletcher took charge of the party,
showing them around the campus.
While reviewing the new stadium, H.
Sunderland, assistant manager, re
marked: "It is one of the most
wonderful sights I have seen. I hope
Australasia may have one like it some
day."
In the evening the Athletic Board
of Control entertained the members
of the party at the "States" in San
Francisco, from whence they departed
for Montreal, via Chicago and Toronto,
embarking on the "Scandinavian." Sat
urday morning, for England.
W. A. Cann, one of the joint man
agers, declared that this is the fast
est rugby team that ever left his
country, and points out that five of
the backs are capable of doing the
100-yard dash in 10.1 seconds, and
three of the forwards can run the
century in 10 r/, seconds.
"Our rugby game," said Captain L.
Cubitt, "is different than the rugby
game as it was played in California.
You have been accustomed to fifteen
men on a side; we have but thirteen,
doing away with two of the forwards.
"There are no line-outs and but six
men in a scrum. The man with the
ball cannot kick out of bounds on the
full. This means the men run more
with the ball and that it has tended
to 'speed up' the sport.
"Our schedule calls for thirty-three
games with various teams in England
and Wales. After that we will chal
lenge the best English team that can
be selected and play them for the
best two out of three games for the

championship."
The trip to England is being made
as a compliment to the English who
last year sent an all-star team to
Australasia in an unsuccessful attempt
to win the international rugby cham
pionship. The Australasians won in
a series of two out of three games.
Arrangements have been made for a
game with the Stanford rugby players
when the Australasians return early
next year.
Rugby, say the visitors, is 011 the
boom in Australia.
It was introduced in the public
schools last year and immediately
there were fifty-five teams in the field
