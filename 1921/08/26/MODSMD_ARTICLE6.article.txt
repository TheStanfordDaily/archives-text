# JANITOR SYSTEM OF UNIVERSITY TO CHANGE
## 
### 
The entire janitor system of the
University will be changed September
Ist, when the American Building Main
tenance Company of San Francisco
will assume the care and charge of
all university buildings. The change
in the janitor system will involve the
dismissal of some workers whom have
been with the University for twenty
or more years.
It. is not known just what help the
San Francisco firm will employ, al
though both men and women will prob
ably be included in the force.
