# STUDENT SPEAKERS AND OPERA STARS IN A. S. S. U. ASSEMBLY
## New Stadium, Honor System, and Freshman Conduct Are Subjects of Final Meeting 
### 
Serious presentations by student
speakers, and musical numbers by junior
Opera stars featured the A. S. S. U.
end-quarter assembly yesterday morn
ing.
Characterizing the Stadium as an evi
dence, concise, and tangible, of the
Stanford spirit, Jack Wendt, '17, ap
pealed to the new students to make
themselves an integral part of the Uni
versity.
"Stanford University is represented
by you. We have line buildings here,
a wonderful campus, hut people judge
Stanford by what you are and what you
do. Go home and talk Stanford. See
that the) besit men from your high
schools come to us. We have only the
room for the best," lie said.
In regard to the Stadium, he told of
the crying need for it, when thousands
were turned away from the big games
on account of lack of seating capacity.
He paid tribute to Leland Cutler, who
entered into the project with a zeal that
became contagious, and which resulted
in a $16,000 subscription toward the
$200,000 needed, a contribution made by
the students themselvesâ€”done only
through a willingness to co-operate and
sacrifice for the good of their Alma
Mater.
"Assist us financially, if you can. in
the construction of the. Stadium," he
asked, "but remember, no stadium is of
any use if we have not tin athletes to
put in it. Every man with two arms
and two legs should turn out for foot
ball this fall."
With football season looming as the
major activity of the fall quarter, such
sentiment drew hearty applause, and
Coach Powell was called upon to speak
concerning football.
"We are not down in the dumps con
cerning football," said he. "Get rid of
that idea, if you ever had it. We lost
last year to a brilliant team. We will
concede that. Rut this year, we have a
nucleus of veterans; we have better ma
terial than ever before, and we liave
wonderful prospects. Also, I look for a
freslunan squad from 50 to 75 per cent
better than that of last year."
Everet Layman spoke in a complimen
tary manner of the way in which the
incoming- freshmen have met the re
quirements of Stanford custom, and
asked their hearty co-operation in put
ting their new classmates, who enter in
the fall, "on the boat."
William Leiser, conducting the pro
gram, again called attention to the honor
system, emphasizing the statement of
President Wilbur that "it is a question
of backbone," a stiffness of the spine
which all Stanford men and women
should possess.
A Junior Opera quartet, Les Seib,
Phil Richards, Elizabeth McArthur and
Erances Merrill, presented song hits
from student musical productions of
past few quarters. "in Our Little
Bungalow," "That Silver Dollar Lady,"
"Mary Lee," "Why Don't the Pretty
Girls Come to College," and "The Cellar
in the Pyramids," were sung.
The assembly adjourned after "Hail,
Stanford, Hail."
