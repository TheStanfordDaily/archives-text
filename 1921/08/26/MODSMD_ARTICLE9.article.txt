# ADVISORY BOARD TO RAISE BIG FUND FOR CONVALESCENT HOME
## 
### 
For the benefit of the Stanford Home
fur Convalescent Children, Mrs. W. !>.
Weir will open her Menlo Park home on
September 30 for bridge and tea. Mrs.
j Timothy Hopkins, president of the ad
j visor}' board of the home; Mrs. Augus
tus Taylor, Mrs. William Breeze, and
Mrs. Charles Lathrop are among those
who are already taking an active part in
the plans.
Efforts are now being directed toward
I the raising of a large endowment fund
for the home, which will provide for its
permanent maintenance. Ihe children s
circus given last month at Menlo Park
and repeated on Sunday added substan
tially to the fund, and the prospective
bridge tea is being planned for the same
object. Since its beginning as a summer
camp at Stanford, the home has been
supported by subscriptions.
Through the generous gifts of San
Francisco, peninsula, Palo Alto, Stan
ford. and valley friends, the enlargement
of the home and its continuance
throughout the. year were made possible.
The old Stanford residence was then
placed, by the university trustees, at the
disposal of the committee in charge, and
lias now become the permanent location
i of the, home. Scarcely a week passes
without further gifts to the home, and
improvements are constantly being made.
At this month's meeting of the advisory
board, new awnings were ordered and
linoleum for the dining porch and bath
room. New dishes are. being planned,
and other minor provisions for the in
creased happiness of the youngsters sent
there from the Stanford clinic for con
valescence.
