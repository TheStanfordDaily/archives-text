For the good of the athletic
situation at Stanford, and more
particularly for the benefit of
the football teams of this year,
we earnestly request the men of
the Sophomore 'and Freshmen
classes to confine all activity
connected with the annual poster
and tying rush to the prescribed
time, beginning Monday after
noon at 4 o'clock, and ending
with the tie-up rush on the aft
ernoon of Tuesday. Upper class
men are urged to see that these
limits of time are not exceeded.
Members of the football squads
are not to be molested, nor will
they participate in the fights.
J. C. PATRICK,
Football Captain.
GENE VAN GENT,
Football Coach.
DAN EVANS,
President, Student Body.
