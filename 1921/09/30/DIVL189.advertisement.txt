Hundreds of
New Hats
$10 and $15
Our Millinery buyer bought these hats in New
York at a remarkable price concession, so we
are offering them to you at prices way below
what you would expect to pay.
There are big hats, small hats, medium-sized
hats! Hats for street, for sports and for dress!
You'll want several of them, so clever are the
styles and so varied are the colors, but—you'll
have to shop early Saturday!
