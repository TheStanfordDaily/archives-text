WELCOME! I
Old Timers!
'
Frosh!
We're glad you're all back—S'pose you're all chuck
full of good resolutions to "Hit the ball hard" and win
some "As". Here's hoping you all do.
We hear the Frosh have a fine looking bunch of foot
ballers—like to see 'em clean up on Cal. OF COURSE f
—The Varsity will go get 'em right—Here's one store (
that knows the score. This November will be much
different than 1920 —we're going to be there to see
them do it, too! j
How do you like the STADIUM?—Too bad you haven't
been around to see it grow —it seems like it sprang ■
up over night! We'll have to initiate it with a string
of victories.
Well, good luck to all—hope to see you "face to face"
soon.—
