# POSTER BATTLE PROMISES TO BE WICKED TUSSLE
## Autos and Bricks Under Ban; Football Candidates Merit Sideline Role in Contests 
### Tom Irwin, '23 
Regulations governing the annual
poster fight and tie-up between the
freshman and sophomore classes were
drawn up at a meeting of a spetial com
mittee of upperclassmen held at the
Men's Union last night. The dates set
for the Searsville splurge and the en
suing battle between the wielders of
red and green paint brushes are Monday
and Tuesday in the order named.
Pre-fight dope is indicative of a
mighty struggle in the contest for class
supremacy, the sophomores on one
hand being many and united, and the
freshmen on the other having in a
large part the advantage of a summer
session for organization. The huskies
of both groups will be out of the
battle ,at least so far as football candi
dates are concerned, through action on
the part of the coaches. No chances are
being taken in having either training or
noses broken.
In accordance with the rules drawn
up, both classes have agreed to keep
their scrimmages off the Quad, not to
light outside the prescribed hours, and
to shelve the autos for the period of
hostility. The exciting but much
frowned-upon practice of "stripping" is
tinder official ban, which will guarantee
the retention of clothing heretofore a
complete loss to the derobed owner.
The gentlemanly custom of tossing Irish
confetti, wielding shilallahs, and sprink
ling torrid water, as well as the use of
several other descendants of the In
quisition, will not be hailed with ac
claim by the upperclassmen in charge.
Upperclassmen, who by virtue of their
authority, give contrary orders to bel
ligerents, will be given an early oppor
tunity to cultivate the official acquaint
ance of the Men's Council. All active
participants in the main engagements
who take part in preliminary skirmishes
will also be accorded this social favor.
The committee in charge of the
fights, in order to protect the tradition
against unfavorable comment, urges the
co-operation of both classes in uphold
ing the rules laid down. A recurrence
of incidents featuring preliminaries to
last year's baseball fight will be received
by the campus with small measure of
delight.
Members of the committee appointed
by Student Body President D. W.
Evans, '20, to draw up the rules and
supervise the rush, are F. A. Betts, '19,

poster fight and tie-up between the
freshman and sophomore classes were
drawn up at a meeting of a spetial com
mittee of upperclassmen held at the
Men's Union last night. The dates set
for the Searsville splurge and the en
suing battle between the wielders of
red and green paint brushes are Monday
and Tuesday in the order named.
Pre-fight dope is indicative of a
mighty struggle in the contest for class
supremacy, the sophomores on one
hand being many and united, and the
freshmen on the other having in a
large part the advantage of a summer
session for organization. The huskies
of both groups will be out of the
battle ,at least so far as football candi
dates are concerned, through action on
the part of the coaches. No chances are
being taken in having either training or
noses broken.
In accordance with the rules drawn
up, both classes have agreed to keep
their scrimmages off the Quad, not to
light outside the prescribed hours, and
to shelve the autos for the period of
hostility. The exciting but much
frowned-upon practice of "stripping" is
tinder official ban, which will guarantee
the retention of clothing heretofore a
complete loss to the derobed owner.
The gentlemanly custom of tossing Irish
confetti, wielding shilallahs, and sprink
ling torrid water, as well as the use of
several other descendants of the In
quisition, will not be hailed with ac
claim by the upperclassmen in charge.
Upperclassmen, who by virtue of their
authority, give contrary orders to bel
ligerents, will be given an early oppor
tunity to cultivate the official acquaint
ance of the Men's Council. All active
participants in the main engagements
who take part in preliminary skirmishes
will also be accorded this social favor.
The committee in charge of the
fights, in order to protect the tradition
against unfavorable comment, urges the
co-operation of both classes in uphold
ing the rules laid down. A recurrence
of incidents featuring preliminaries to
last year's baseball fight will be received
by the campus with small measure of
delight.

by Student Body President D. W.
