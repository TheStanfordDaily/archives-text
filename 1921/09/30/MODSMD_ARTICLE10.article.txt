# CARDINAL VARSITY TO TANGLE WITH MARE BUND MARINES IN OPENER
## SEAY'S FRESHMAN ELEVEN TO PLAY LOWELL HIGH TEAM TENTATIVE LINEUP INCLUDES MANY STARS OF LAST YEAR'S VARSITY 
### 
Eighty-five freshmen, comprising the
largest turnout of first-year football can
didates that ever turned out for fall
practice, reported to Coach Duffy Seay
on Monday, September 19. So large and
cumbersome was the squad that it was
necessary to hire two assistants to help
handle the men. Bob Cravens, guard on
last year's varsity who was ruled off the
turf this season by the doctors, is coach
ing the linemen. A, F. Malarkey, who
played halfback on the Oregon varsity
for three years under Hugo Bezdek, is
handling the backfield candidates.
Four teams have been chosen for the
purpose of scrimmaging and to allow
the coaches to get a line on every man
who is out for the sport. Two of these
teams scrimmage each day and, with a
number of substitutes for each eleven
going into the games, the coaches see
every man in action every other day.
Seay has not finally selected the men
who will compose the eleven which will
meet the Lowell High School team in
the first game tomorrow afternoon. It
appears, however, that most of the men
who compose Team A of the practice
aggregations will be the boys who will
be in position when the game starts.
Stuart Van Hook will doubtless start
the game at center. Van Hook regis
ters from Santa Monica High, where he
played four years at center. He is ru
small fellow but has been bowling over
his larger opponents with seeming ease
in practice. He looks to have a good
knowledge of the fine points of foot
ball.
Bob Jansen, who played center on the
Freshman basketball team last spring,
will play left end. Jansen played rugby
at Lowell in San Francisco, but lie has

Stanford students will be given their
first opportunity to see the 1921 Varsity
football team in action tomorrow when
the Cardinal team will line up against
the Marines from Mare Island. For
more than two weeks Coach Gene Van
Gent, his assistants, "Dink" Templeton,
Professor J. B. Canning, Joe Fitzgerald,
and seventy-five men have been work
ing out twice daily preparing the team
that is to meet the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California in the game that
will dedicate the new Stanford stadium
on November 19.
Coach Van Gent, consulting and
planning with his assistants, has devised
a system of football which he hopes
will humble the "wonder team" and
land Stanford at the top of the confer
ence teams. Seventy-five men reported
for practice fifty days early to receive
the benefits of expert coaching and to
learn the new system. Tomorrow after
noon will see the first trial of the plan
which is drawn from the combined
knowledge and experience of four
former football players who were stars
during their undergraduate years.
Van Gent was faced with the prob
lem of building almost an entirely new
line. Only two or three old faces will
be seen in the line tomorrow. Last year's
line was practically wrecked hjr 'he
graduation of several of the players.
Stice at right guard and Pershing at
left end are the only men who went
through the entire season and are back
again this year.
Center will be occupied by Dudley
DeGroot, who played that position and
tackle in sveral preliminary games dur
ing the 1920 season. DeGroot is a young
behemoth with propensities that are dis
tinctly disturbing to the opposing 'cen
ter. He has a fighting way that carries
him over the enemy center and into the
thick of the fight. DeGroot weighs 202
hard pounds this year and is going
great.
Bob Stice will likely be in his old po
sition at right guard and the left guard
position will find "Scotch" Campbell
doing the fighting. Campbell was a
backfield star on Dufify Seay's 1924
Freshman team, but Line-coach Canning
sees the makings of a good guard in the
young man so he has been transferred
to the line. "Red" Betts, who played
guard under Bob Evans in 1919, is back
on the .campus, but he will not be ready
to start in the opening game.
Harley Carter and Joe Douglass will
do the bulk of the tackling. Carter
promises to be the star tackle of the
western firmament this season. He
knows everything that a good tackle
should, and with plenty of weight and
fighting spirit to carry him along lie
will go fast and often this season. Doug
lass is another protege of Canning. In
his frosh days he performed in the
backfield, but it is apparent that some
one slipped when he put Douglass be
hind the line. Tackle seems to be his
natural position. Charley Helser is an
other likely looking tackle. He has
weight and plenty of aggressiveness. He
will break into the battle before it has
gone far.
Van Gent has four ends that he can
acquired most of the knowledge neces
sary to play end and with an abundance
of natural ability is shaping up as a
regular. Wideman of Los Angeles High
will play the other end position. He
played end two years before coming to
college and looks like a good man for
the job.
The two tackles on Team A are the
fellows who are showing the stuff.
Harry Shipke, who hails from Fullerton
High School, looks like the best tackle
on the squad. He is big and shifty and
has plenty of the old fight. Norman
Dole of Riverside High School has a
family reputation to maintain. Several
of his brothers were stars on football
and track varsities here in the old days,
and Norman bids fair to keep up the
good work. He played center and tackle
two years before entering Stanford.
The guards are Neill of Los Angeles
and Hayes of Palo Alto. Both are fast
and clever players. Crook from the
University High in Oakland should edge
into a guard position before the season
is very old. He injured his shoulder
in a scrimmage Wednesday and will be
on the shelf for a few days.
Cuddeback looks like the goods as a
fullback. He is a big fellow with line
plunging propensities and a magnificent
boot. He stands head and shoulders
over the other fullback candidates both
physically and in point of ability.
Guy Dennis will conduct the team
work from the quarterback position.
Dennis played quarterback on the Los
Angeles High School eleven last season
and appears to be a past master at call
ing plays and instilling fight in the team.
Seay has two tearing halfbacks that
he can open the first game with. Gillan
came from Phoenix to make the fresh
man eleven and at the rate he has been
going they will not be able to keep him
off. Several coaches made trips into
Arizona, trying to inveigle Gillan into
coming to the institutions they repre
sented, but he determined upon Stan
ford as his stamping ground for the next
four years.
Lynn Howard, the other half, played
for two years on the Potter High eleven
in San Francisco. He is a husky young
ster with lots of football ability.
This is the way the team will probably
take the field tomorrow. There are sev
eral other men of ability on the other
three elevens who will likely see action
before the game goes very far. Seay
will not announce his selections until
after practice tonight.

send and he will probably do an eeney
meeney before he decides on the two
to start the game. Dick Pershing has
been shifted from tackle to end and
while he is new in the position he seems
to fill the bill nicely. He is fast, knows
lots of football, and he should pick up
all the fine points that will make him
as valuable an end as he was a tackle.
"Swede" Larson looks like he will
get his innings this season. The "Swede"
has been out for an end job for two
seasons, but Pelouze, Adams, and "Rab"
Shlaudeman were 011 the job before he
came to college and he never got a
chance. However, the end jobs are open
this year and the best man wins and
Larson looks mighty good. "Kewpie"
Sproul and Ted Mertz are likewise bat
tling for one of the end jobs. Sproul
played end a little last year, but most
of his work was at fullback. This sea
son he is giving all his attention to pay
ing end and he is showing up well.
Mertz was ineligible las. year, but his
playing in the scrimmages i. dicates that
he knows lots about playing tne position.
There are two or three men that Van
Gent could start at quarterback, but
"Bud" Woodward, quarter on last
year's freshman eleven, looks like the
choice to open the game. Woodward is
not very big but what he lacks in size
he more than makes up in his aggres
siveness, and the beautiful part of his
aggressiveness is that it is contagious.
He certainly instils the old fight in the
gang.
In the event that Woodward is called
upon to direct the team, Bob Shlaude
man will play right halfback. Shlaude
man is a pippin of a field general him
self. but he is also a wonderful open
field runner, the possessor of a wicked
straight arm, and an uncanny way of
advancing the ball, so that he is really
more valuable at half than in the quar
terback position. Wilcox, at left half,
needs no introduction. His work
throughout last season was of sterling
quality, and he captained the team that
walloped Santa Clara, Oregon, and
Washington. Guess that recommends
him. Morris Kirksey will break into
the game at half as soon as his dogs
stop bothering him. Kirksey is fast and
the possessor of a good head, and
though he is new at the game, he will
see plenty of action before the season
is very old.
Ray Doughty is another halfback who
will probably get into action tomorrow.
Doughty has been going great guns in
the scrimmages. He is an open field
runner of class and he also understands
the* Van Gent system of coaching, hav
ing played under the head coach at the
University of Texas. Walter Phelps
has been playing a clever game at half
back. This is Phelps' first year with the
varsity although he played lots of foot
ball during his prep school days.
Getting down to the fullback and cap
tain last is no business, but doesn't it
say somewhere that the last shall be
first? That is where Jack Patrick will
be, first in every offensive and right be
hind the line on every defensive play
that looks like the opposition is going to
try to come through. Otherwise Pat
rick will be planted where he can nab
those punts and carry the ball back to
where it belongs. Patrick, under the
careful tutelage of "Dink" Templeton,
is kicking them farther than ever this
season. He was good enough last sea
son, so you can figure how far he is
booting them this year. Sufficient it is
to say that Stanford will suffer no losses
in the punting exchanges this year.
Of the Mare Island Marines very
little is known. They are coached by a

brother of "Hub" Huebel, football of
ficial par excellence, and this brother
played two years on the University of
Michigan and two on the Michigan Ag
gies team. Doubtless he has groomed a
blinch of leathernecks that will give the
varsity some fun.
The varsity will get into action at 2 :30
immediately after the Freshman-Lowell
High game. The admission is student
body cards or fifty cents.

quality, and he captained the team that
walloped Santa Clara, Oregon, and
Washington. Guess that recommends
him. Morris Kirksey will break into
the game at half as soon as his dogs
stop bothering him. Kirksey is fast and
the possessor of a good head, and
though he is new at the game, he will
see plenty of action before the season
is very old.
Ray Doughty is another halfback who
will probably get into action tomorrow.
Doughty has been going great guns in
the scrimmages. He is an open field
runner of class and he also understands
the* Van Gent system of coaching, hav
ing played under the head coach at the
University of Texas. Walter Phelps
has been playing a clever game at half
back. This is Phelps' first year with the
varsity although he played lots of foot
ball during his prep school days.
Getting down to the fullback and cap
tain last is no business, but doesn't it
say somewhere that the last shall be
first? That is where Jack Patrick will
be, first in every offensive and right be
hind the line on every defensive play
that looks like the opposition is going to
try to come through. Otherwise Pat
rick will be planted where he can nab
those punts and carry the ball back to
where it belongs. Patrick, under the
careful tutelage of "Dink" Templeton,
is kicking them farther than ever this
season. He was good enough last sea
son, so you can figure how far he is
booting them this year. Sufficient it is
to say that Stanford will suffer no losses
in the punting exchanges this year.
Of the Mare Island Marines very
little is known. They are coached by a

brother of "Hub" Huebel, football of
ficial par excellence, and this brother
played two years on the University of
Michigan and two on the Michigan Ag
gies team. Doubtless he has groomed a
blinch of leathernecks that will give the
varsity some fun.
The varsity will get into action at 2 :30
immediately after the Freshman-Lowell
High game. The admission is student
body cards or fifty cents.
Eighty-five freshmen, comprising the
largest turnout of first-year football can
didates that ever turned out for fall
practice, reported to Coach Duffy Seay
on Monday, September 19. So large and
cumbersome was the squad that it was
necessary to hire two assistants to help
handle the men. Bob Cravens, guard on
last year's varsity who was ruled off the
turf this season by the doctors, is coach
ing the linemen. A, F. Malarkey, who
played halfback on the Oregon varsity
for three years under Hugo Bezdek, is
handling the backfield candidates.
Four teams have been chosen for the
purpose of scrimmaging and to allow
the coaches to get a line on every man
who is out for the sport. Two of these
teams scrimmage each day and, with a
number of substitutes for each eleven
going into the games, the coaches see
every man in action every other day.
Seay has not finally selected the men
who will compose the eleven which will
meet the Lowell High School team in
the first game tomorrow afternoon. It
appears, however, that most of the men
who compose Team A of the practice
aggregations will be the boys who will
be in position when the game starts.
Stuart Van Hook will doubtless start
the game at center. Van Hook regis
ters from Santa Monica High, where he
played four years at center. He is ru
small fellow but has been bowling over
his larger opponents with seeming ease
in practice. He looks to have a good
knowledge of the fine points of foot
ball.
Bob Jansen, who played center on the
Freshman basketball team last spring,
will play left end. Jansen played rugby
at Lowell in San Francisco, but lie has

Stanford students will be given their
first opportunity to see the 1921 Varsity
football team in action tomorrow when
the Cardinal team will line up against
the Marines from Mare Island. For
more than two weeks Coach Gene Van
Gent, his assistants, "Dink" Templeton,
Professor J. B. Canning, Joe Fitzgerald,
and seventy-five men have been work
ing out twice daily preparing the team
that is to meet the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California in the game that
will dedicate the new Stanford stadium
on November 19.
Coach Van Gent, consulting and
planning with his assistants, has devised
a system of football which he hopes
will humble the "wonder team" and
land Stanford at the top of the confer
ence teams. Seventy-five men reported
for practice fifty days early to receive
the benefits of expert coaching and to
learn the new system. Tomorrow after
noon will see the first trial of the plan
which is drawn from the combined
knowledge and experience of four
former football players who were stars
during their undergraduate years.
Van Gent was faced with the prob
lem of building almost an entirely new
line. Only two or three old faces will
be seen in the line tomorrow. Last year's
line was practically wrecked hjr 'he
graduation of several of the players.
Stice at right guard and Pershing at
left end are the only men who went
through the entire season and are back
again this year.
Center will be occupied by Dudley
DeGroot, who played that position and
tackle in sveral preliminary games dur
ing the 1920 season. DeGroot is a young
behemoth with propensities that are dis
tinctly disturbing to the opposing 'cen
ter. He has a fighting way that carries
him over the enemy center and into the
thick of the fight. DeGroot weighs 202
hard pounds this year and is going
great.
Bob Stice will likely be in his old po
sition at right guard and the left guard
position will find "Scotch" Campbell
doing the fighting. Campbell was a
backfield star on Dufify Seay's 1924
Freshman team, but Line-coach Canning
sees the makings of a good guard in the
young man so he has been transferred
to the line. "Red" Betts, who played
guard under Bob Evans in 1919, is back
on the .campus, but he will not be ready
to start in the opening game.
Harley Carter and Joe Douglass will
do the bulk of the tackling. Carter
promises to be the star tackle of the
western firmament this season. He
knows everything that a good tackle
should, and with plenty of weight and
fighting spirit to carry him along lie
will go fast and often this season. Doug
lass is another protege of Canning. In
his frosh days he performed in the
backfield, but it is apparent that some
one slipped when he put Douglass be
hind the line. Tackle seems to be his
natural position. Charley Helser is an
other likely looking tackle. He has
weight and plenty of aggressiveness. He
will break into the battle before it has
gone far.
Van Gent has four ends that he can
acquired most of the knowledge neces
sary to play end and with an abundance
of natural ability is shaping up as a
regular. Wideman of Los Angeles High
will play the other end position. He
played end two years before coming to
college and looks like a good man for
the job.
The two tackles on Team A are the
fellows who are showing the stuff.
Harry Shipke, who hails from Fullerton
High School, looks like the best tackle
on the squad. He is big and shifty and
has plenty of the old fight. Norman
Dole of Riverside High School has a
family reputation to maintain. Several
of his brothers were stars on football
and track varsities here in the old days,
and Norman bids fair to keep up the
good work. He played center and tackle
two years before entering Stanford.
The guards are Neill of Los Angeles
and Hayes of Palo Alto. Both are fast
and clever players. Crook from the
University High in Oakland should edge
into a guard position before the season
is very old. He injured his shoulder
in a scrimmage Wednesday and will be
on the shelf for a few days.
Cuddeback looks like the goods as a
fullback. He is a big fellow with line
plunging propensities and a magnificent
boot. He stands head and shoulders
over the other fullback candidates both
physically and in point of ability.
Guy Dennis will conduct the team
work from the quarterback position.
Dennis played quarterback on the Los
Angeles High School eleven last season
and appears to be a past master at call
ing plays and instilling fight in the team.
Seay has two tearing halfbacks that
he can open the first game with. Gillan
came from Phoenix to make the fresh
man eleven and at the rate he has been
going they will not be able to keep him
off. Several coaches made trips into
Arizona, trying to inveigle Gillan into
coming to the institutions they repre
sented, but he determined upon Stan
ford as his stamping ground for the next
four years.
Lynn Howard, the other half, played
for two years on the Potter High eleven
in San Francisco. He is a husky young
ster with lots of football ability.
This is the way the team will probably
take the field tomorrow. There are sev
eral other men of ability on the other
three elevens who will likely see action
before the game goes very far. Seay
will not announce his selections until
after practice tonight.

send and he will probably do an eeney
meeney before he decides on the two
to start the game. Dick Pershing has
been shifted from tackle to end and
while he is new in the position he seems
to fill the bill nicely. He is fast, knows
lots of football, and he should pick up
all the fine points that will make him
as valuable an end as he was a tackle.
"Swede" Larson looks like he will
get his innings this season. The "Swede"
has been out for an end job for two
seasons, but Pelouze, Adams, and "Rab"
Shlaudeman were 011 the job before he
came to college and he never got a
chance. However, the end jobs are open
this year and the best man wins and
Larson looks mighty good. "Kewpie"
Sproul and Ted Mertz are likewise bat
tling for one of the end jobs. Sproul
played end a little last year, but most
of his work was at fullback. This sea
son he is giving all his attention to pay
ing end and he is showing up well.
Mertz was ineligible las. year, but his
playing in the scrimmages i. dicates that
he knows lots about playing tne position.
There are two or three men that Van
Gent could start at quarterback, but
"Bud" Woodward, quarter on last
year's freshman eleven, looks like the
choice to open the game. Woodward is
not very big but what he lacks in size
he more than makes up in his aggres
siveness, and the beautiful part of his
aggressiveness is that it is contagious.
He certainly instils the old fight in the
gang.
In the event that Woodward is called
upon to direct the team, Bob Shlaude
man will play right halfback. Shlaude
man is a pippin of a field general him
self. but he is also a wonderful open
field runner, the possessor of a wicked
straight arm, and an uncanny way of
advancing the ball, so that he is really
more valuable at half than in the quar
terback position. Wilcox, at left half,
needs no introduction. His work
throughout last season was of sterling
quality, and he captained the team that
walloped Santa Clara, Oregon, and
Washington. Guess that recommends
him. Morris Kirksey will break into
the game at half as soon as his dogs
stop bothering him. Kirksey is fast and

to fill the bill nicely. He is fast, knows
lots of football, and he should pick up
all the fine points that will make him
as valuable an end as he was a tackle.
"Swede" Larson looks like he will
get his innings this season. The "Swede"
has been out for an end job for two
seasons, but Pelouze, Adams, and "Rab"
Shlaudeman were 011 the job before he
came to college and he never got a
chance. However, the end jobs are open
this year and the best man wins and
Larson looks mighty good. "Kewpie"
Sproul and Ted Mertz are likewise bat
tling for one of the end jobs. Sproul
played end a little last year, but most
of his work was at fullback. This sea
son he is giving all his attention to pay
ing end and he is showing up well.
Mertz was ineligible las. year, but his
playing in the scrimmages i. dicates that
he knows lots about playing tne position.
There are two or three men that Van
Gent could start at quarterback, but
"Bud" Woodward, quarter on last
year's freshman eleven, looks like the
choice to open the game. Woodward is
not very big but what he lacks in size
he more than makes up in his aggres
siveness, and the beautiful part of his
aggressiveness is that it is contagious.
He certainly instils the old fight in the
gang.
In the event that Woodward is called
upon to direct the team, Bob Shlaude
man will play right halfback. Shlaude
man is a pippin of a field general him
self. but he is also a wonderful open
field runner, the possessor of a wicked
straight arm, and an uncanny way of
advancing the ball, so that he is really
more valuable at half than in the quar
terback position. Wilcox, at left half,
needs no introduction. His work
throughout last season was of sterling
quality, and he captained the team that
walloped Santa Clara, Oregon, and
Washington. Guess that recommends
him. Morris Kirksey will break into
the game at half as soon as his dogs
stop bothering him. Kirksey is fast and
the possessor of a good head, and
though he is new at the game, he will
see plenty of action before the season
is very old.
Ray Doughty is another halfback who
will probably get into action tomorrow.
Doughty has been going great guns in
the scrimmages. He is an open field
runner of class and he also understands
the* Van Gent system of coaching, hav
ing played under the head coach at the
University of Texas. Walter Phelps
has been playing a clever game at half
back. This is Phelps' first year with the
varsity although he played lots of foot
ball during his prep school days.
Getting down to the fullback and cap
tain last is no business, but doesn't it
say somewhere that the last shall be
first? That is where Jack Patrick will
be, first in every offensive and right be
hind the line on every defensive play
that looks like the opposition is going to
try to come through. Otherwise Pat
rick will be planted where he can nab
those punts and carry the ball back to
where it belongs. Patrick, under the
careful tutelage of "Dink" Templeton,
is kicking them farther than ever this
season. He was good enough last sea
son, so you can figure how far he is
booting them this year. Sufficient it is
to say that Stanford will suffer no losses
in the punting exchanges this year.
Of the Mare Island Marines very
little is known. They are coached by a

brother of "Hub" Huebel, football of
ficial par excellence, and this brother
played two years on the University of
Michigan and two on the Michigan Ag
gies team. Doubtless he has groomed a
blinch of leathernecks that will give the
varsity some fun.
The varsity will get into action at 2 :30
immediately after the Freshman-Lowell
High game. The admission is student
body cards or fifty cents.
Eighty-five freshmen, comprising the
largest turnout of first-year football can
didates that ever turned out for fall
practice, reported to Coach Duffy Seay
on Monday, September 19. So large and
cumbersome was the squad that it was
necessary to hire two assistants to help
handle the men. Bob Cravens, guard on
last year's varsity who was ruled off the
turf this season by the doctors, is coach
ing the linemen. A, F. Malarkey, who
played halfback on the Oregon varsity
for three years under Hugo Bezdek, is
handling the backfield candidates.
Four teams have been chosen for the
purpose of scrimmaging and to allow
the coaches to get a line on every man
who is out for the sport. Two of these
teams scrimmage each day and, with a
number of substitutes for each eleven
going into the games, the coaches see
every man in action every other day.
Seay has not finally selected the men
who will compose the eleven which will
meet the Lowell High School team in
the first game tomorrow afternoon. It
appears, however, that most of the men
who compose Team A of the practice
aggregations will be the boys who will
be in position when the game starts.
Stuart Van Hook will doubtless start
the game at center. Van Hook regis
ters from Santa Monica High, where he
played four years at center. He is ru
small fellow but has been bowling over
his larger opponents with seeming ease
in practice. He looks to have a good
knowledge of the fine points of foot
ball.
Bob Jansen, who played center on the
Freshman basketball team last spring,
will play left end. Jansen played rugby
at Lowell in San Francisco, but lie has

Stanford students will be given their
first opportunity to see the 1921 Varsity
football team in action tomorrow when
the Cardinal team will line up against
the Marines from Mare Island. For
more than two weeks Coach Gene Van
Gent, his assistants, "Dink" Templeton,
Professor J. B. Canning, Joe Fitzgerald,
and seventy-five men have been work
ing out twice daily preparing the team
that is to meet the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California in the game that
will dedicate the new Stanford stadium
on November 19.
Coach Van Gent, consulting and
planning with his assistants, has devised
a system of football which he hopes
will humble the "wonder team" and
land Stanford at the top of the confer
ence teams. Seventy-five men reported
for practice fifty days early to receive
the benefits of expert coaching and to
learn the new system. Tomorrow after
noon will see the first trial of the plan
which is drawn from the combined
knowledge and experience of four
former football players who were stars
during their undergraduate years.
Van Gent was faced with the prob
lem of building almost an entirely new
line. Only two or three old faces will
be seen in the line tomorrow. Last year's
line was practically wrecked hjr 'he
graduation of several of the players.
Stice at right guard and Pershing at
left end are the only men who went
through the entire season and are back
again this year.
Center will be occupied by Dudley
DeGroot, who played that position and
tackle in sveral preliminary games dur
ing the 1920 season. DeGroot is a young
behemoth with propensities that are dis
tinctly disturbing to the opposing 'cen
ter. He has a fighting way that carries
him over the enemy center and into the
thick of the fight. DeGroot weighs 202
hard pounds this year and is going
great.
Bob Stice will likely be in his old po
sition at right guard and the left guard
position will find "Scotch" Campbell
doing the fighting. Campbell was a
backfield star on Dufify Seay's 1924
Freshman team, but Line-coach Canning
sees the makings of a good guard in the
young man so he has been transferred
to the line. "Red" Betts, who played
guard under Bob Evans in 1919, is back
on the .campus, but he will not be ready
to start in the opening game.
Harley Carter and Joe Douglass will
do the bulk of the tackling. Carter
promises to be the star tackle of the
western firmament this season. He
knows everything that a good tackle
should, and with plenty of weight and
fighting spirit to carry him along lie
will go fast and often this season. Doug
lass is another protege of Canning. In
his frosh days he performed in the
backfield, but it is apparent that some
one slipped when he put Douglass be
hind the line. Tackle seems to be his
natural position. Charley Helser is an
other likely looking tackle. He has
weight and plenty of aggressiveness. He
will break into the battle before it has
gone far.
Van Gent has four ends that he can
acquired most of the knowledge neces
sary to play end and with an abundance
of natural ability is shaping up as a
regular. Wideman of Los Angeles High
will play the other end position. He
played end two years before coming to
college and looks like a good man for
the job.
The two tackles on Team A are the
fellows who are showing the stuff.
Harry Shipke, who hails from Fullerton
High School, looks like the best tackle
on the squad. He is big and shifty and
has plenty of the old fight. Norman
Dole of Riverside High School has a
family reputation to maintain. Several
of his brothers were stars on football
and track varsities here in the old days,
and Norman bids fair to keep up the
good work. He played center and tackle
two years before entering Stanford.
The guards are Neill of Los Angeles
and Hayes of Palo Alto. Both are fast
and clever players. Crook from the
University High in Oakland should edge
into a guard position before the season
is very old. He injured his shoulder
in a scrimmage Wednesday and will be
on the shelf for a few days.
Cuddeback looks like the goods as a
fullback. He is a big fellow with line
plunging propensities and a magnificent
boot. He stands head and shoulders
over the other fullback candidates both
physically and in point of ability.
Guy Dennis will conduct the team
work from the quarterback position.
Dennis played quarterback on the Los
Angeles High School eleven last season
and appears to be a past master at call
ing plays and instilling fight in the team.
Seay has two tearing halfbacks that
he can open the first game with. Gillan
came from Phoenix to make the fresh
man eleven and at the rate he has been
going they will not be able to keep him
off. Several coaches made trips into
Arizona, trying to inveigle Gillan into
coming to the institutions they repre
sented, but he determined upon Stan
ford as his stamping ground for the next
four years.
Lynn Howard, the other half, played
for two years on the Potter High eleven
in San Francisco. He is a husky young
ster with lots of football ability.
This is the way the team will probably
take the field tomorrow. There are sev
eral other men of ability on the other
three elevens who will likely see action
before the game goes very far. Seay
will not announce his selections until
after practice tonight.

send and he will probably do an eeney
meeney before he decides on the two
to start the game. Dick Pershing has
been shifted from tackle to end and

and track varsities here in the old days,
and Norman bids fair to keep up the
good work. He played center and tackle
two years before entering Stanford.
The guards are Neill of Los Angeles
and Hayes of Palo Alto. Both are fast
and clever players. Crook from the
University High in Oakland should edge
into a guard position before the season
is very old. He injured his shoulder
in a scrimmage Wednesday and will be
on the shelf for a few days.
Cuddeback looks like the goods as a
fullback. He is a big fellow with line
plunging propensities and a magnificent
boot. He stands head and shoulders
over the other fullback candidates both
physically and in point of ability.
Guy Dennis will conduct the team
work from the quarterback position.
Dennis played quarterback on the Los
Angeles High School eleven last season
and appears to be a past master at call
ing plays and instilling fight in the team.
Seay has two tearing halfbacks that
he can open the first game with. Gillan
came from Phoenix to make the fresh
man eleven and at the rate he has been
going they will not be able to keep him
off. Several coaches made trips into
Arizona, trying to inveigle Gillan into
coming to the institutions they repre
sented, but he determined upon Stan
ford as his stamping ground for the next
four years.
Lynn Howard, the other half, played
for two years on the Potter High eleven
in San Francisco. He is a husky young
ster with lots of football ability.
This is the way the team will probably
take the field tomorrow. There are sev
eral other men of ability on the other
three elevens who will likely see action
before the game goes very far. Seay
will not announce his selections until
after practice tonight.

send and he will probably do an eeney
meeney before he decides on the two
to start the game. Dick Pershing has
been shifted from tackle to end and
while he is new in the position he seems
to fill the bill nicely. He is fast, knows
lots of football, and he should pick up
all the fine points that will make him
as valuable an end as he was a tackle.
"Swede" Larson looks like he will
get his innings this season. The "Swede"
has been out for an end job for two
seasons, but Pelouze, Adams, and "Rab"
Shlaudeman were 011 the job before he
came to college and he never got a
chance. However, the end jobs are open
this year and the best man wins and
Larson looks mighty good. "Kewpie"
Sproul and Ted Mertz are likewise bat
tling for one of the end jobs. Sproul
played end a little last year, but most
of his work was at fullback. This sea
son he is giving all his attention to pay
ing end and he is showing up well.
Mertz was ineligible las. year, but his
playing in the scrimmages i. dicates that
he knows lots about playing tne position.
There are two or three men that Van
Gent could start at quarterback, but
"Bud" Woodward, quarter on last
year's freshman eleven, looks like the
choice to open the game. Woodward is
not very big but what he lacks in size
he more than makes up in his aggres
siveness, and the beautiful part of his
aggressiveness is that it is contagious.
He certainly instils the old fight in the
gang.
In the event that Woodward is called
upon to direct the team, Bob Shlaude
man will play right halfback. Shlaude
man is a pippin of a field general him
self. but he is also a wonderful open
field runner, the possessor of a wicked
straight arm, and an uncanny way of
advancing the ball, so that he is really
more valuable at half than in the quar
terback position. Wilcox, at left half,
needs no introduction. His work
throughout last season was of sterling
quality, and he captained the team that
walloped Santa Clara, Oregon, and
Washington. Guess that recommends
him. Morris Kirksey will break into
the game at half as soon as his dogs
stop bothering him. Kirksey is fast and
the possessor of a good head, and
though he is new at the game, he will
see plenty of action before the season
is very old.
Ray Doughty is another halfback who
will probably get into action tomorrow.
Doughty has been going great guns in
the scrimmages. He is an open field
runner of class and he also understands
the* Van Gent system of coaching, hav
ing played under the head coach at the
University of Texas. Walter Phelps
has been playing a clever game at half
back. This is Phelps' first year with the
varsity although he played lots of foot
ball during his prep school days.
Getting down to the fullback and cap
tain last is no business, but doesn't it
say somewhere that the last shall be
first? That is where Jack Patrick will
be, first in every offensive and right be
hind the line on every defensive play
that looks like the opposition is going to
try to come through. Otherwise Pat
rick will be planted where he can nab
those punts and carry the ball back to
where it belongs. Patrick, under the
careful tutelage of "Dink" Templeton,
is kicking them farther than ever this
season. He was good enough last sea
son, so you can figure how far he is
booting them this year. Sufficient it is
to say that Stanford will suffer no losses
in the punting exchanges this year.
Of the Mare Island Marines very
little is known. They are coached by a

brother of "Hub" Huebel, football of
ficial par excellence, and this brother
played two years on the University of
Michigan and two on the Michigan Ag
gies team. Doubtless he has groomed a
blinch of leathernecks that will give the
varsity some fun.
The varsity will get into action at 2 :30
immediately after the Freshman-Lowell
High game. The admission is student
body cards or fifty cents.
Eighty-five freshmen, comprising the
largest turnout of first-year football can
didates that ever turned out for fall
practice, reported to Coach Duffy Seay
on Monday, September 19. So large and
cumbersome was the squad that it was
necessary to hire two assistants to help
handle the men. Bob Cravens, guard on
last year's varsity who was ruled off the
turf this season by the doctors, is coach
ing the linemen. A, F. Malarkey, who
played halfback on the Oregon varsity
for three years under Hugo Bezdek, is
handling the backfield candidates.
Four teams have been chosen for the
purpose of scrimmaging and to allow
the coaches to get a line on every man
who is out for the sport. Two of these
teams scrimmage each day and, with a
number of substitutes for each eleven
going into the games, the coaches see
every man in action every other day.
Seay has not finally selected the men
who will compose the eleven which will
meet the Lowell High School team in
the first game tomorrow afternoon. It
appears, however, that most of the men
who compose Team A of the practice
aggregations will be the boys who will
be in position when the game starts.
Stuart Van Hook will doubtless start
the game at center. Van Hook regis
ters from Santa Monica High, where he
played four years at center. He is ru
small fellow but has been bowling over
his larger opponents with seeming ease
in practice. He looks to have a good
knowledge of the fine points of foot
ball.
Bob Jansen, who played center on the
Freshman basketball team last spring,
will play left end. Jansen played rugby
at Lowell in San Francisco, but lie has

Stanford students will be given their
first opportunity to see the 1921 Varsity
football team in action tomorrow when
the Cardinal team will line up against
the Marines from Mare Island. For
more than two weeks Coach Gene Van
Gent, his assistants, "Dink" Templeton,
Professor J. B. Canning, Joe Fitzgerald,
and seventy-five men have been work
ing out twice daily preparing the team
that is to meet the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California in the game that
will dedicate the new Stanford stadium
on November 19.
Coach Van Gent, consulting and
planning with his assistants, has devised
a system of football which he hopes
will humble the "wonder team" and
land Stanford at the top of the confer
ence teams. Seventy-five men reported
for practice fifty days early to receive
the benefits of expert coaching and to
learn the new system. Tomorrow after
noon will see the first trial of the plan
which is drawn from the combined
knowledge and experience of four
former football players who were stars
during their undergraduate years.
Van Gent was faced with the prob
lem of building almost an entirely new
line. Only two or three old faces will
be seen in the line tomorrow. Last year's
line was practically wrecked hjr 'he
graduation of several of the players.
Stice at right guard and Pershing at
left end are the only men who went
through the entire season and are back
again this year.
Center will be occupied by Dudley
DeGroot, who played that position and
tackle in sveral preliminary games dur
ing the 1920 season. DeGroot is a young
behemoth with propensities that are dis
tinctly disturbing to the opposing 'cen
ter. He has a fighting way that carries
him over the enemy center and into the
thick of the fight. DeGroot weighs 202
hard pounds this year and is going
great.
Bob Stice will likely be in his old po
sition at right guard and the left guard
position will find "Scotch" Campbell
doing the fighting. Campbell was a
backfield star on Dufify Seay's 1924
Freshman team, but Line-coach Canning
sees the makings of a good guard in the
young man so he has been transferred
to the line. "Red" Betts, who played
guard under Bob Evans in 1919, is back
on the .campus, but he will not be ready
to start in the opening game.
Harley Carter and Joe Douglass will
do the bulk of the tackling. Carter
promises to be the star tackle of the
western firmament this season. He
knows everything that a good tackle
should, and with plenty of weight and
fighting spirit to carry him along lie
will go fast and often this season. Doug
lass is another protege of Canning. In
his frosh days he performed in the
backfield, but it is apparent that some
one slipped when he put Douglass be
hind the line. Tackle seems to be his
natural position. Charley Helser is an
other likely looking tackle. He has
weight and plenty of aggressiveness. He
will break into the battle before it has
gone far.
Van Gent has four ends that he can
acquired most of the knowledge neces
sary to play end and with an abundance
of natural ability is shaping up as a
regular. Wideman of Los Angeles High
will play the other end position. He
played end two years before coming to
college and looks like a good man for
the job.
The two tackles on Team A are the
fellows who are showing the stuff.
Harry Shipke, who hails from Fullerton
High School, looks like the best tackle
on the squad. He is big and shifty and
has plenty of the old fight. Norman
Dole of Riverside High School has a
family reputation to maintain. Several
of his brothers were stars on football
and track varsities here in the old days,
and Norman bids fair to keep up the
good work. He played center and tackle
two years before entering Stanford.
The guards are Neill of Los Angeles
and Hayes of Palo Alto. Both are fast

Bob Stice will likely be in his old po
sition at right guard and the left guard
position will find "Scotch" Campbell
doing the fighting. Campbell was a
backfield star on Dufify Seay's 1924
Freshman team, but Line-coach Canning
sees the makings of a good guard in the
young man so he has been transferred
to the line. "Red" Betts, who played
guard under Bob Evans in 1919, is back
on the .campus, but he will not be ready
to start in the opening game.
Harley Carter and Joe Douglass will
do the bulk of the tackling. Carter
promises to be the star tackle of the
western firmament this season. He
knows everything that a good tackle
should, and with plenty of weight and
fighting spirit to carry him along lie
will go fast and often this season. Doug
lass is another protege of Canning. In
his frosh days he performed in the
backfield, but it is apparent that some
one slipped when he put Douglass be
hind the line. Tackle seems to be his
natural position. Charley Helser is an
other likely looking tackle. He has
weight and plenty of aggressiveness. He
will break into the battle before it has
gone far.
Van Gent has four ends that he can
acquired most of the knowledge neces
sary to play end and with an abundance
of natural ability is shaping up as a
regular. Wideman of Los Angeles High
will play the other end position. He
played end two years before coming to
college and looks like a good man for
the job.
The two tackles on Team A are the
fellows who are showing the stuff.
Harry Shipke, who hails from Fullerton
High School, looks like the best tackle
on the squad. He is big and shifty and
has plenty of the old fight. Norman
Dole of Riverside High School has a
family reputation to maintain. Several
of his brothers were stars on football
and track varsities here in the old days,
and Norman bids fair to keep up the
good work. He played center and tackle
two years before entering Stanford.
The guards are Neill of Los Angeles
and Hayes of Palo Alto. Both are fast
and clever players. Crook from the
University High in Oakland should edge
into a guard position before the season
is very old. He injured his shoulder
in a scrimmage Wednesday and will be
on the shelf for a few days.
Cuddeback looks like the goods as a
fullback. He is a big fellow with line
plunging propensities and a magnificent
boot. He stands head and shoulders
over the other fullback candidates both
physically and in point of ability.
Guy Dennis will conduct the team
work from the quarterback position.
Dennis played quarterback on the Los
Angeles High School eleven last season
and appears to be a past master at call
ing plays and instilling fight in the team.
Seay has two tearing halfbacks that
he can open the first game with. Gillan
came from Phoenix to make the fresh
man eleven and at the rate he has been
going they will not be able to keep him
off. Several coaches made trips into
Arizona, trying to inveigle Gillan into
coming to the institutions they repre
sented, but he determined upon Stan
ford as his stamping ground for the next
four years.
Lynn Howard, the other half, played
for two years on the Potter High eleven
in San Francisco. He is a husky young
ster with lots of football ability.
This is the way the team will probably
take the field tomorrow. There are sev
eral other men of ability on the other
three elevens who will likely see action
before the game goes very far. Seay
will not announce his selections until
after practice tonight.

send and he will probably do an eeney
meeney before he decides on the two
to start the game. Dick Pershing has
been shifted from tackle to end and
while he is new in the position he seems
to fill the bill nicely. He is fast, knows
lots of football, and he should pick up
all the fine points that will make him
as valuable an end as he was a tackle.
"Swede" Larson looks like he will
get his innings this season. The "Swede"
has been out for an end job for two
seasons, but Pelouze, Adams, and "Rab"
Shlaudeman were 011 the job before he
came to college and he never got a
chance. However, the end jobs are open
this year and the best man wins and
Larson looks mighty good. "Kewpie"
Sproul and Ted Mertz are likewise bat
tling for one of the end jobs. Sproul
played end a little last year, but most
of his work was at fullback. This sea
son he is giving all his attention to pay
ing end and he is showing up well.
Mertz was ineligible las. year, but his
playing in the scrimmages i. dicates that
he knows lots about playing tne position.
There are two or three men that Van
Gent could start at quarterback, but
"Bud" Woodward, quarter on last
year's freshman eleven, looks like the
choice to open the game. Woodward is
not very big but what he lacks in size
he more than makes up in his aggres
siveness, and the beautiful part of his
aggressiveness is that it is contagious.
He certainly instils the old fight in the
gang.
In the event that Woodward is called
upon to direct the team, Bob Shlaude
man will play right halfback. Shlaude
man is a pippin of a field general him
self. but he is also a wonderful open
field runner, the possessor of a wicked
straight arm, and an uncanny way of
advancing the ball, so that he is really
more valuable at half than in the quar
terback position. Wilcox, at left half,
needs no introduction. His work
throughout last season was of sterling
quality, and he captained the team that
walloped Santa Clara, Oregon, and
Washington. Guess that recommends
him. Morris Kirksey will break into
the game at half as soon as his dogs
stop bothering him. Kirksey is fast and
the possessor of a good head, and
though he is new at the game, he will
see plenty of action before the season
is very old.
Ray Doughty is another halfback who
will probably get into action tomorrow.
Doughty has been going great guns in
the scrimmages. He is an open field
runner of class and he also understands
the* Van Gent system of coaching, hav
ing played under the head coach at the
University of Texas. Walter Phelps
has been playing a clever game at half
back. This is Phelps' first year with the
varsity although he played lots of foot
ball during his prep school days.
Getting down to the fullback and cap
tain last is no business, but doesn't it
say somewhere that the last shall be
first? That is where Jack Patrick will
be, first in every offensive and right be
hind the line on every defensive play
that looks like the opposition is going to
try to come through. Otherwise Pat
rick will be planted where he can nab
those punts and carry the ball back to
where it belongs. Patrick, under the
careful tutelage of "Dink" Templeton,
is kicking them farther than ever this
season. He was good enough last sea
son, so you can figure how far he is
booting them this year. Sufficient it is
to say that Stanford will suffer no losses
in the punting exchanges this year.
Of the Mare Island Marines very
little is known. They are coached by a

brother of "Hub" Huebel, football of
ficial par excellence, and this brother
played two years on the University of
Michigan and two on the Michigan Ag
gies team. Doubtless he has groomed a
blinch of leathernecks that will give the
varsity some fun.
The varsity will get into action at 2 :30
immediately after the Freshman-Lowell
High game. The admission is student
body cards or fifty cents.
Eighty-five freshmen, comprising the
largest turnout of first-year football can
didates that ever turned out for fall
practice, reported to Coach Duffy Seay
on Monday, September 19. So large and
cumbersome was the squad that it was
necessary to hire two assistants to help
handle the men. Bob Cravens, guard on
last year's varsity who was ruled off the
turf this season by the doctors, is coach
ing the linemen. A, F. Malarkey, who
played halfback on the Oregon varsity
for three years under Hugo Bezdek, is
handling the backfield candidates.
Four teams have been chosen for the
purpose of scrimmaging and to allow
the coaches to get a line on every man
who is out for the sport. Two of these
teams scrimmage each day and, with a
number of substitutes for each eleven
going into the games, the coaches see
every man in action every other day.
Seay has not finally selected the men
who will compose the eleven which will
meet the Lowell High School team in
the first game tomorrow afternoon. It
appears, however, that most of the men
who compose Team A of the practice
aggregations will be the boys who will
be in position when the game starts.
Stuart Van Hook will doubtless start
the game at center. Van Hook regis
ters from Santa Monica High, where he
played four years at center. He is ru
small fellow but has been bowling over
his larger opponents with seeming ease
in practice. He looks to have a good
knowledge of the fine points of foot
ball.
Bob Jansen, who played center on the
Freshman basketball team last spring,
will play left end. Jansen played rugby
at Lowell in San Francisco, but lie has

Stanford students will be given their
first opportunity to see the 1921 Varsity
football team in action tomorrow when
the Cardinal team will line up against
the Marines from Mare Island. For
more than two weeks Coach Gene Van
Gent, his assistants, "Dink" Templeton,
Professor J. B. Canning, Joe Fitzgerald,
and seventy-five men have been work
ing out twice daily preparing the team
that is to meet the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California in the game that
will dedicate the new Stanford stadium
on November 19.
Coach Van Gent, consulting and
planning with his assistants, has devised
a system of football which he hopes
will humble the "wonder team" and
land Stanford at the top of the confer
ence teams. Seventy-five men reported
for practice fifty days early to receive
the benefits of expert coaching and to
learn the new system. Tomorrow after
noon will see the first trial of the plan
which is drawn from the combined
knowledge and experience of four
former football players who were stars
during their undergraduate years.
Van Gent was faced with the prob
lem of building almost an entirely new
line. Only two or three old faces will
be seen in the line tomorrow. Last year's
line was practically wrecked hjr 'he
graduation of several of the players.
Stice at right guard and Pershing at
left end are the only men who went
through the entire season and are back
again this year.
Center will be occupied by Dudley
DeGroot, who played that position and
tackle in sveral preliminary games dur
ing the 1920 season. DeGroot is a young
behemoth with propensities that are dis
tinctly disturbing to the opposing 'cen
ter. He has a fighting way that carries
him over the enemy center and into the
thick of the fight. DeGroot weighs 202
hard pounds this year and is going
great.
Bob Stice will likely be in his old po
sition at right guard and the left guard
position will find "Scotch" Campbell
doing the fighting. Campbell was a
backfield star on Dufify Seay's 1924
