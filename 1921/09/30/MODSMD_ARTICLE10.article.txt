# CARDINAL VARSITY TO TANGLE WITH MARE BUND MARINES IN OPENER
## SEAY'S FRESHMAN ELEVEN TO PLAY LOWELL HIGH TEAM TENTATIVE LINEUP INCLUDES MANY STARS OF LAST YEAR'S VARSITY 
### 
Eighty-five freshmen, comprising the
largest turnout of first-year football can
didates that ever turned out for fall
practice, reported to Coach Duffy Seay
on Monday, September 19. So large and
cumbersome was the squad that it was
necessary to hire two assistants to help
handle the men. Bob Cravens, guard on
last year's varsity who was ruled off the
turf this season by the doctors, is coach
ing the linemen. A, F. Malarkey, who
played halfback on the Oregon varsity
for three years under Hugo Bezdek, is
handling the backfield candidates.
Four teams have been chosen for the
purpose of scrimmaging and to allow
the coaches to get a line on every man
who is out for the sport. Two of these
teams scrimmage each day and, with a
number of substitutes for each eleven
going into the games, the coaches see
every man in action every other day.
Seay has not finally selected the men
who will compose the eleven which will
meet the Lowell High School team in
the first game tomorrow afternoon. It
appears, however, that most of the men
who compose Team A of the practice
aggregations will be the boys who will
be in position when the game starts.
Stuart Van Hook will doubtless start
the game at center. Van Hook regis
ters from Santa Monica High, where he
played four years at center. He is ru
small fellow but has been bowling over
his larger opponents with seeming ease
in practice. He looks to have a good
knowledge of the fine points of foot
ball.
Bob Jansen, who played center on the
Freshman basketball team last spring,
will play left end. Jansen played rugby
at Lowell in San Francisco, but lie has

Stanford students will be given their
first opportunity to see the 1921 Varsity
football team in action tomorrow when
the Cardinal team will line up against
the Marines from Mare Island. For
more than two weeks Coach Gene Van
Gent, his assistants, "Dink" Templeton,
Professor J. B. Canning, Joe Fitzgerald,
and seventy-five men have been work
ing out twice daily preparing the team
that is to meet the Bruins of the Uni
versity of California in the game that
will dedicate the new Stanford stadium
on November 19.
Coach Van Gent, consulting and
planning with his assistants, has devised
a system of football which he hopes
will humble the "wonder team" and
land Stanford at the top of the confer
ence teams. Seventy-five men reported
for practice fifty days early to receive
the benefits of expert coaching and to
learn the new system. Tomorrow after
noon will see the first trial of the plan
which is drawn from the combined
knowledge and experience of four
former football players who were stars
during their undergraduate years.
Van Gent was faced with the prob
lem of building almost an entirely new
line. Only two or three old faces will
be seen in the line tomorrow. Last year's
line was practically wrecked hjr 'he
graduation of several of the players.
Stice at right guard and Pershing at
left end are the only men who went
through the entire season and are back
again this year.
Center will be occupied by Dudley
DeGroot, who played that position and
tackle in sveral preliminary games dur
ing the 1920 season. DeGroot is a young
behemoth with propensities that are dis
tinctly disturbing to the opposing 'cen
ter. He has a fighting way that carries
him over the enemy center and into the
thick of the fight. DeGroot weighs 202
hard pounds this year and is going
great.
Bob Stice will likely be in his old po
sition at right guard and the left guard
position will find "Scotch" Campbell
doing the fighting. Campbell was a
backfield star on Dufify Seay's 1924
Freshman team, but Line-coach Canning
sees the makings of a good guard in the
young man so he has been transferred
to the line. "Red" Betts, who played
guard under Bob Evans in 1919, is back
on the .campus, but he will not be ready
to start in the opening game.
Harley Carter and Joe Douglass will
do the bulk of the tackling. Carter
promises to be the star tackle of the
western firmament this season. He
knows everything that a good tackle
should, and with plenty of weight and
fighting spirit to carry him along lie
will go fast and often this season. Doug
lass is another protege of Canning. In
his frosh days he performed in the
backfield, but it is apparent that some
one slipped when he put Douglass be
hind the line. Tackle seems to be his
natural position. Charley Helser is an
other likely looking tackle. He has
weight and plenty of aggressiveness. He
will break into the battle before it has
gone far.
Van Gent has four ends that he can
