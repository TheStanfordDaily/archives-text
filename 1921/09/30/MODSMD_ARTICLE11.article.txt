# FOOD INSTITUTE IN PERMANENT QUARTERS
## 
### 
The Stanford Food Research Insti
tute is settled in its permanent quarters
on the campus and at work. Yesterday
desks and other equipment were moved
into the building at the northwest cor
ner of the Inner Quad containing rooms
30 to 35. This building has been va
cated by the Department of Education
to provide offices for the Food Institute
staff. Alterations are being made in the
other Education department buildings
which permit that department to con
centrate its forces in order to turn over
this building to the Food Institute.
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, who has been
chosen by his colleagues to be Executive
Secretary of the Institute for this year,
and Dr. Carl Lucas Alsberg, who re
signed as chief chemist of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture to become
a director of the Food Institute, are in
stalled in their officcs and at work. Dr.
Joseph S. Davis, who has resigned as a
professor of economics at Harvard to
become the third of the three directors
of the Institute, is expected to reach the
campus soon.
Besides offices for the three directors
the building on the Inner Quad will pro
vide space for their secretaries and for
the staff of statisticians and research
students who will aid in the work.
In the Library building the large
room immediately at the right of the en
trance lobby, which has been occupied
by Professors Tatlock and Kennedy
while they have been at work on the
Chaucer dictionary begun by the late
Professor Ewald Fluegel, is being fitted
up as a reading room for the use of the
Food Instittuc workers and others who
will make use of the Hoover War Col
lection. Shelf space for the Hoover
Collection will he provided in the stack
room, which adjoins thi c reading room.
The work of the Food Research In
stitute for the present will be along
broad lines in the general fields that
have been laid out, gathering and cor
relating statistical, economic, and social
data bearing on the production, dis
tribution, and utilization of food. The
directors are carrying out a survey of
the whole field of present investigation
and study in order that there may be
as little duplication of .iffort as possible.
The Stanford Food Institute does not
expect immediately to carry on any ex
tensive laboratory investigations of its
own, but field work is already under
way.
Among the first efforts will be studies
of practical problems connected with
food supply, such as those of cost and
transportation, and the endeavor to com
pile for the benefit of those interested
some of the knowledge already attained
but not yet thoroughly organized.

broad lines in the general fields that
have been laid out, gathering and cor
relating statistical, economic, and social
data bearing on the production, dis
tribution, and utilization of food. The
directors are carrying out a survey of
the whole field of present investigation
and study in order that there may be
as little duplication of .iffort as possible.
The Stanford Food Institute does not
expect immediately to carry on any ex
tensive laboratory investigations of its
own, but field work is already under
way.
Among the first efforts will be studies
of practical problems connected with
food supply, such as those of cost and
transportation, and the endeavor to com
pile for the benefit of those interested
some of the knowledge already attained
but not yet thoroughly organized.
