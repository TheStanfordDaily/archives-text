# STADIUM AND ATHLETICS
## 
### 
After you have shaken hands until your arm feels as if it belonged
in a sling and you have congratulated yourself that you are back at Stan
ford again, you will probably start looking around you. Then little
twinges of doubt will start troubling your mind. You are back, that is
certain, but is it the same Stanford that you left? Most certainly it is
not ' The old spirit is here, apparent in every welcome, but seemingly in
creased an hundredfold. The air fairly tingles' with unconcealed optim
ism. "How do things look ?" is almost the first question asked by every
new arrival. The enthusiastic answer is "Great!" And that answer is
genuine. Stanford students realize that they are facing the greatest year
athletically that this institution has ever seen. And they are ready to do
their share in making it the greatest. t . ,
The apparent reason for all of the enthusiasm is to be found on the
plot of ground at the intersection of the railroad tracks and Embarcadero
Road. The field that was being scraped last June is now the scene of a
mammoth athletic stadium. A stadium that is a monument to Cardinal
spirit and enterprise. It is unbelievable that such a structure could have
sprung out of the ground in the short space of three and one-half
months. But there it stands, and we are forced to believe and to wonder.
It is mainly due to the great work of the Stanford Engineering Com
mission, the financial backing of the alumni and friends of the University,
and the'perfect execution by the contractors that it will be ready for the
annual Big Game on November 19. Students, too, gave freely of their
time and money in the promotion of the bowl, but their real work begins
now. Students now face the task of building teams that will uphold the
Cardinal on the athletic fields. The immediate task is to create a football
team that will defeat the wonder team from the University of California
on the day the stadium is dedicated.
Everyone is confident that the trick can be turned. The stadium was
built in three and one-half months. The students believe that as great a
team can be created in ten weeks.
The unfailing alumni have sent in men from all districts of the
state who are athletes, students, and natural leaders—fellows who will
make their marks in the classrooms as well as on the athletic fields.
There are more than eighty-five new men now working for positions on
the freshman eleven. These men comprise the greatest number that ever
turned out for a first-year athletic team at Stanford.
In the adjoining field there are eighty men who are being molded into
an eleven that will face California when the stadium is dedicated, bv one
of the most complete and capable coaching stafifs Stanford has ever had.

The first great step has been taken. An athletic stadium which seats
65,000 people has been provided. It is squat elv up to the students to
fill it. If the playing field is covered with earnest athletes the seats on
the inclines will be filled with enthusiastic spectators.
Every Stanford man and woman will do his and her little bit. Re
sults will begin to show in the middle of November. If you know an
athlete, urge him to get out for sports. Bui do not stop at urging: help
bim after he gets out.

After you have shaken hands until your arm feels as if it belonged
in a sling and you have congratulated yourself that you are back at Stan
ford again, you will probably start looking around you. Then little
twinges of doubt will start troubling your mind. You are back, that is
certain, but is it the same Stanford that you left? Most certainly it is
not ' The old spirit is here, apparent in every welcome, but seemingly in
creased an hundredfold. The air fairly tingles' with unconcealed optim
ism. "How do things look ?" is almost the first question asked by every
new arrival. The enthusiastic answer is "Great!" And that answer is
genuine. Stanford students realize that they are facing the greatest year
athletically that this institution has ever seen. And they are ready to do
their share in making it the greatest. t . ,
The apparent reason for all of the enthusiasm is to be found on the
plot of ground at the intersection of the railroad tracks and Embarcadero
Road. The field that was being scraped last June is now the scene of a
mammoth athletic stadium. A stadium that is a monument to Cardinal
spirit and enterprise. It is unbelievable that such a structure could have
sprung out of the ground in the short space of three and one-half
months. But there it stands, and we are forced to believe and to wonder.
It is mainly due to the great work of the Stanford Engineering Com
mission, the financial backing of the alumni and friends of the University,
and the'perfect execution by the contractors that it will be ready for the
annual Big Game on November 19. Students, too, gave freely of their
time and money in the promotion of the bowl, but their real work begins
now. Students now face the task of building teams that will uphold the
Cardinal on the athletic fields. The immediate task is to create a football
team that will defeat the wonder team from the University of California
on the day the stadium is dedicated.
Everyone is confident that the trick can be turned. The stadium was
built in three and one-half months. The students believe that as great a
team can be created in ten weeks.
The unfailing alumni have sent in men from all districts of the
state who are athletes, students, and natural leaders—fellows who will
make their marks in the classrooms as well as on the athletic fields.
There are more than eighty-five new men now working for positions on
the freshman eleven. These men comprise the greatest number that ever
turned out for a first-year athletic team at Stanford.
In the adjoining field there are eighty men who are being molded into
an eleven that will face California when the stadium is dedicated, bv one
of the most complete and capable coaching stafifs Stanford has ever had.

the inclines will be filled with enthusiastic spectators.
