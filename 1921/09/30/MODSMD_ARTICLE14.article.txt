# OBSERVE THE RULES
## 
### 
Underclassmen should read carefully the rules governing the annual
poster fight and tieup which are scheduled to take place on next Monday
night and Tuesday afternoon. There is always a tendency on the part of
the contestants to begin the conflicts a little early, due perhaps to over
enthusiasm, abundant energy, or just the plain idea of getting an edge on
the other class by winning a few preliminary skirmishes.
The danger in these ante-bellum scrimmages is that they are carried
too far, and it becomes necessary for the student officials to call off the
main fight. Such was the case last spring when a preliminary battle was
staged in the hills before the traditional baseball fight. Several men were
injured, one or two severely enough to necessitate their being taken to a
hospital. As a result the baseball fight, the most strategic, interesting,
and the most equal of the underclass rushes was tabooed by action of the
Men's Council.
There are many benefits derived by the participants in the annual

underclass rushes. For the freshmen they serve to make them acquainted
with each other. They are thrown together for the first time, and the
growth of the unified spirit which will account for much of their success
as a class organization is begun. I here are few friendships like those
which are begun around the campfires on the hillsides and in the excite
ment of the half-hour battle which rages on the fraternity lawns after
ward. The benefits to the sophomores are much the same. 1 hey are
reunited in the places where they first became acquainted with each
other. Old friendships are renewed and class unity is more firmly
implanted.
Besides the benefits derived by the participants the fact that this
double-headed rush is traditional should the underclassmen to pause
before they break any of the rules laid down by the committee appointed
by the President of the Associated Students.
The rules are printed in full on the front page of this paper, and
every Freshman and Sophomore is urged to make himself familiar with
them before the fight begins ' lay afternoon. Ihe penalty for
breaking the rules— stringei y the Men's Council—should not
be the onlv reason for level 1 on the part of all contestants. It
is a point of honor to obser ;s of fair play and to uphold the
traditions of Stanford.
