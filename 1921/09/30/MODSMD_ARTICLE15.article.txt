### 
A new and unusual field of historical
study in American Universities is of
fered at Stanford this fall by the ap
pointment of Captain Edward L.
Beach, U. S. N. Retired, as lecturer
in Naval History. Captain Beach has
had a long and distinguished career.
He graduated at Annapolis in 18S8
and has served in many capacities in
the Navy, both on active service in
all parts of the world and in posts
of importance in the United States.
He was an officer with Admiral Dewey
in the battle of Manila Bay, 1898, was
the naval diplomatic agent of the
United States when dealing with the
Carranza government in Mexico, and
was chief of staff to Admiral Caper
ton in the pacification of Haiti and
Santo Domingo. He was in command
of the "Memphis" when \that ,ship
was engulfed and destroyed by a tidal
wave without warning, in August,
1916. He commanded the "New
York" in the North Sea in the latter
part of the great war and at the
time of the surrender of the German
fleet. Recently he has been Com
mandant at the Mare Island navy
yard and station in San Francisco
Bay.
Captain Beach has long been known
as one of the best informed students
and teachers of American Naval his
tory, and at one time was Professor
of History at Annapolis Naval Aca
demy. He is the author of many
books, of which the best known are
probably his numerous boys' stories
of the navy. His interest in naval
history has led him to secure early
retirement from the navey and he
comes to Stanford as lecturer on his
special subject in the history depart
ment. For this year he will offer but
two courses, one a lecture course open
to all except freshmen, twice a week
throughout the year, Tuesdays and
Thursdays, at 11 o'clock, giving a sur
vey of American naval history, and
emphasizing the influence and effect
our naval policy has had on the de
velopment of the United States. The
second course will be a seminar, limit
ed to seniors and graduate, on "The
American Navy in the Spanish Amer
ican War."
This work is in some degree an
experiment both for Stanford Univer
sity and for the Navy department,
since fliat department permitted Cap
tain Beach's retirement on the ground
that he was unusually qualified to
write on naval history, and could per
form a service by doing so, because
the idea of college instruction in nava!
history by an ex-naval officer of dis
tinction appealing to the Navy Depart
ment as a very interesting experiment
in itself.

was engulfed and destroyed by a tidal
wave without warning, in August,
1916. He commanded the "New
York" in the North Sea in the latter
part of the great war and at the
time of the surrender of the German
fleet. Recently he has been Com
mandant at the Mare Island navy
yard and station in San Francisco
Bay.
Captain Beach has long been known
as one of the best informed students
and teachers of American Naval his
tory, and at one time was Professor
of History at Annapolis Naval Aca
demy. He is the author of many
books, of which the best known are
probably his numerous boys' stories
of the navy. His interest in naval
history has led him to secure early
retirement from the navey and he
comes to Stanford as lecturer on his
special subject in the history depart
ment. For this year he will offer but
two courses, one a lecture course open
to all except freshmen, twice a week
throughout the year, Tuesdays and
Thursdays, at 11 o'clock, giving a sur
vey of American naval history, and
emphasizing the influence and effect
our naval policy has had on the de
velopment of the United States. The
second course will be a seminar, limit
ed to seniors and graduate, on "The
American Navy in the Spanish Amer
ican War."
This work is in some degree an
experiment both for Stanford Univer
sity and for the Navy department,
since fliat department permitted Cap
tain Beach's retirement on the ground
that he was unusually qualified to
write on naval history, and could per
form a service by doing so, because
the idea of college instruction in nava!
history by an ex-naval officer of dis
tinction appealing to the Navy Depart
ment as a very interesting experiment
in itself.
