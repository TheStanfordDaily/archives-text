Conies the yell of the yell-leader. "As
sistance!" cries he. And Bob Connolly,
'22, will meet all men of junior standing
at 320 Encina, Monday afternoon at
4:20 o'clock. From among those who
aspire to become assistants, two will be
chosen. Connolly will announce the time
for try-outs at the meeting.
