# CARDINAL WILL BE ON SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
The first issue of the Stanford Cardi
nal for the year appears tomorrow
morning on the campus. Archie
Binns, back from a trip, to India and
the Far East, has an interesting bit of
fiction, titlted "Devon," about a char
acter of a man "instinctively admired
by women." Binns has woven a story
of the sea and the east that maintains
the interest of the reader to the end.
Wylie Kilpatrick, manager of the
Cardinal, has an editorial, "Resting on
Their Oars," in which he takes up the
politics of the state and the nation
in an excellent fashion.
