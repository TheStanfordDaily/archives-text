# COMPTROLLER ORDERS SPEEDY FIRE WAGON FOR BLAZE CHASERS
## 
### 
Bliss has succeeded gloom, a tri*
I umph glow has supplanted that har
rassed scowl, once more the populace
ordinary may tingle beneath his care
less smile. Let the birds warble for
our trusty Fire Chief is a new man.
Seagrave's Combination Pumping
Engine, Chemical Engine and Hose
Carrier has been ordered by the Comp
troller's office for immediate delivery.
It's a de-luxe model with apparent
possibilities for six or seven other
combinations including a caliope,
landing-net, photography, and all man
ner of devices which the manufacturer
neglected but which a handy man
could attach between fires. Owners
of burning buildings will, no doubt,
be pleased with the honor of waiting
fifteen minutes, or so, for a $10,250,
88-liorse-power, 450 gallon per minute,
engine. The department will, no
doubt, give preference to the earliest
applicants.
