# CARDINAL TENNIS SQUAD ENDS TRIP
## Stanford Racqueters Return With Eastern Championship After Successful Trip 
### 
Stanford's Varsity tennis team will
return this week-end after one of the
most successful eastern invasions ever
taken by a western racquet squad. Not
only did the Cardinal duo of Captain
Phil Neer and Jimmy Davies sweep
everything before them in the intercol
legiates but their showing in the na
tional tournaments was also exceptional,
rating the praise of the leading sport
writers of the East.
The Stanford pair started their east
ern trip last spring by Jimmy Davies
winning the Pacific Coast conlerence
singles title for the second consecutive
season from Wallace Bates of the Blue
and Gold squad. From here, Neer and
Davies journeyed to the middle West
and East, playing one of the stiffest
schedules of the season with the leading
universities of the United States, and
ending with the National Intercollegiate
championships at Haverford, Pa., dur
ing the latter part of June.
In the dual tournaments with the east
ern and middle west teams, the Cardinal
squad defeated every opponent, and up
until the last few matches, did not lose
a set. Among the teams who fell before
the onslaught of the Stanford pair were
the Universities of Minnesota, Chicago,
Illinois, Detroit, Michigan, Amherst,
Yale, and Dartmouth.
In the National Intercollegiate tourna
ment at Haverford, Captain Phil Neer
upset all dope in the East by defeating
Fenno, the Harvard captain, in five sets
for the national singles title, bringing
the laurels to the West for the first time
in the history of the national champion
ships. The doubles team also made a
good showing in the tournament, being
eliminated only after a hard fight in the
semi-finals by the Harvard team. Jimmy
Davies fought his way to the semi-finals
in the singles event, but lost to Fenno.
The Stanford pair appeared in many
of the leading tournaments of the East
throughout the summer, making a good
showing at every appearance. Much
valuable experience was gained by the
Cardinal men in these tournament
through the competition encountered,
Neer and Davies both playing against
the national champion, Tildcn, during
their stay in the East.
With the showing of the Cardinal
team in the East during the first year
of tennis as a major sport at Stanford,
the racquet sport has well earned the
right to be placed with the leading in
tercollegiate athletics of the university
and with both members of the eastern
team back this year, together with the
members of the freshman squad of last
year, Stanford should rank high in this
sport during the coming season.
