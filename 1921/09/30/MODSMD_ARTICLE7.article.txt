# SURD BOWL GUILDERS NEAR RECORD FINISH
## Unique Achievement is Made Possible by Loyal Support and Effective Co-operation 
### 
Stanford students left the University
last spring when three tractors were just
beginning to scratch the surface of the
ground just east of the car line to Palo
Alto. They rejturn to iind an immense
stadium almost completed.
All of which is a unique and record
achievement. One day last winter quar
ter Stanford officially decided that it
would be splendid to have a large bowl
in which to play the Big Game. A few
weeks later the Board of Control defi
nitely decided to build a Radium, one
of the common type, within two years,
and began a mail campaign for subscrip
tions.
Then the Board of Control, certain
alumni, and a couple of engineers from
the Stanford faculty got together and
devised a plan of their own by which to
construct a bowl for and a
few days before the end of the spring
quart,er the campus was astounded with
the Daily Palo Alto's announcement that
Stanford would have a stadium for the
Big Game in 1921 !
The contract was let. Palmer and Mc-
Bride went'to work, and a great pit be
gan to take shape. A portable sawmill
sprung up beside the Palo Alto car line
and carpenters started constructing seats
in the parts of the excavation already
finished.
The excavators hit the bottom of the
howl last week. T hey are now straight
ening up the work, depositing loam on
the playing field, and finishing the ex
terior surface. Two weeks should see
the completion of the last of the seats.
And now Gene Van Gent, â€¢ "Dink"
Templeton, J. B. Canning, and Joe Fitz
gerald and Captain Jack Patrick are
busy morning and night developing the
eleven that will christen the new bowl
in the first big game this year.
A turf playing field will be ready for
the Big Game. The exterior of the bowl
will be planted in green vetch and cer
tain shrubbery which will give a com
plete and finished appearance. The steps
and aisles will be painted, the seats
themselves will be left in their natural
brown color, as paint has been found
to injure dresses and clothing of specta
tors.
In constructing the stadium the Stan
ford alumni, faculty and students have
co-operrjted in one definite enterprise as
probably never before in the Univer
sity's history. Sixty-five thousand people
will witness the first contest in the
stadium this year, . and every one of
them will be in a measure indebted to
certain students, certain faculty mem
bers, and certain alumni, without whose
ability and foresight the bowl would not
have been possible for many years.
