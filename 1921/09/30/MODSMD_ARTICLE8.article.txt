# STUDENT MANAGER SYSTEM TO OPERATE AGAIN THIS SEASON
## 
### 
The system of student managers of
athletic teams which was inaugurated
last year will operate in full force
this season, giving an opportunity to
the men who are not out for football
to help Stanford turn out a winning
team. The plan being followed is the
one which has worked so successfully
at California and many Eastern col
leges.
Each major sport will have a man
ager selected from the senior class.
This man will have almost complete
charge of all teams in his particular
major sporty including varsity and
second varsity, freshmen and second
freshmen. He will be responsible for
the details of every game played and
for everything in connection with the
team. The senior manager goes on
all trips made by his teams and has
complete charge of the team on these
trips. If the graduate manager makes
the trip he acts only in an advisory
capacity.
The graduate manager is the busi
ness manager for all athletics. The
senior manager is the directing head
of the teams in his particular sport.
He is rewarded for his work by a
sweater and a modified Block "S," be
sides making all trips with his teams.
The senior manager is assisted by
men from the junior class, the number
depending upon the sport. Five or

six assistants will be needed for foot
ball. One of these juniors will be se
lected by the senior manager and the
graduate manager at the close of the
season, as the senior manager for
the coming season. This selection
will be based upon the quality of the
work performed during the current
season.
The junior managers will be re
sponsible to the senior manager and to
him only. Among their duties will be
the reception of and care of visiting
teams and officials, the supervision of
the distribution of advertising matter,
care of equipment and the working out
of details for all trips.

number of which will not be limited.
All sophomores are eligible and are

just going into effect, all positions for

The system of student managers of
athletic teams which was inaugurated
last year will operate in full force
this season, giving an opportunity to
the men who are not out for football
to help Stanford turn out a winning
team. The plan being followed is the
one which has worked so successfully
at California and many Eastern col
leges.
Each major sport will have a man
ager selected from the senior class.
This man will have almost complete
charge of all teams in his particular
major sporty including varsity and
second varsity, freshmen and second
freshmen. He will be responsible for
the details of every game played and
for everything in connection with the
team. The senior manager goes on
all trips made by his teams and has
complete charge of the team on these
trips. If the graduate manager makes
the trip he acts only in an advisory
capacity.
The graduate manager is the busi
ness manager for all athletics. The
senior manager is the directing head
of the teams in his particular sport.
He is rewarded for his work by a
sweater and a modified Block "S," be
sides making all trips with his teams.
The senior manager is assisted by
men from the junior class, the number
depending upon the sport. Five or

six assistants will be needed for foot
ball. One of these juniors will be se
lected by the senior manager and the
graduate manager at the close of the
season, as the senior manager for
the coming season. This selection
will be based upon the quality of the
work performed during the current
season.
The junior managers will be re
sponsible to the senior manager and to
him only. Among their duties will be
the reception of and care of visiting
teams and officials, the supervision of
the distribution of advertising matter,
care of equipment and the working out
of details for all trips.
Junior managers will be selected
from the sophomore tryoutees, the
number of which will not be limited.
All sophomores are eligible and are
urged to try out.
Their duties are helping the coaches
011 the field, care of equipment, and
the distribution of advertising matter.
From among the sophomores the
junior managers will be elected and
here again election will be based en
tirely 011 performance.
Due to the fact that the system is
just going into effect, all positions for
junior managers and sophomores are
still open. This gives those who are
not athletes and those whose sport
comes at a different time of the year a
chance to do a big service for Stan
ford athletics.
