# RECORD TOTAL IS REGISTERED IN UNIVERSITY
## Number of Men Registered at Stanford Exceeds Total of Last Year s Record by 200 
### 
Figures obtained from the Regist
rar's office today show the largest
registration in the history of the Uni
versity. Although the correct totals
could not be secured, due to the enter
ing of a few today, the present num
ber enrolled last Friday and Satur
day far exceed the record crowd of
last fall.
A large number of old students have
not yet enrolled but the number of
new students including tliose who
entered in the summer quarter is one
of the largest at Stanford to date.
The total registration recorded at
noon today reached 2499 students as
compared with 2284 for last fall. How
ever, a large number of registration
slips have been handed to students
which are still out and until these are
all in, the exact total will not be
known.
Of the 2499 students enrolled in
the University during the past week
end, 1999 are men as compared with
1784 at the same time last year. The
number of women in each case has
only equaled the 500 limit. The final
total registration for the Autumn
quarter of last year was 2494 which
is already exceeded on the first class
day of this term.
The statistics of the number of new
students and old students in this year's
enrollment are not yet completed but
the number of new students is prob
ably larger than it was last year. The
return of the normal proportion of old
students from a larger student body
last year than the preceeding year
would naturally result in a larger total
registration this year.
