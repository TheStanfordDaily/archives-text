All students who wish to register for
choir and oratorio have been requested
to see University Organist Warren D.
Allen this week at his office between 9
and 10 o'clock in the morning. He has
emphasized the necessity of reporting
this week.
The first rehearsal will be at 8 o'clock
Thursday night and will be important.
* Allen plans to present Horatio Par
ker's "Dream of Mary" in December,
which will be its first presentation in
the West. It is particularly interesting
because of its tableaux in addition to
the musical work. The leading part is
spoken.
The San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra will also take part in the annual
oratorio.
Allen has announced that a large choir
will be needed next Sunday to take part
in the matriculation services.
Tuesday afternoon at 4:15 he will play
informally in the Memorial Church, an
nouncing no definite program.
Attention has been called to the fact
that the time schedule gives the incor
rect hour for rehearsals in Oratoria.
The work in this course is done 'I hurs
day evening after the regular choir re
hearsal at 8:15, and not in the morning.
