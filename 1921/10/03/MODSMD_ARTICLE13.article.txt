# CALIFORNIA DEFEATS OLYMPIC CLUB ELEVEN
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif., Oct. 3â€”Cali
fornia smashed the Olympic Club
eleven of San Francisco, for a 14-0
victory, Saturday afternoon, in the
hardest played game of the season.
The clubmen displayed strong defense
and twice held the Californians for
downs on their one-yard line.
The Olympians played a strong de
fensive game in the second half and
held California at every turn. Only
once did they threaten to score, that
one a cleverly executed forward pass.
A pass over the line lost them the
ball and their only chance to score.
Nisbit starred for California at full
back and Berkey and Muller in the
line. Needles and Dobson were the
Stars for the Clubmen.
