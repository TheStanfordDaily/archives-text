Stanford welcomes its new, students. Men who have recognized
ability along scholastic and athletic lines and men who are natural
leaders among their fellows are recognized among the ranks of the
new class. These are the men who will bear the brunt of upholding
the high standards of Stanford athletically and scholastically for the
next four years. Great hope is placed in these men.
Stanford is a place where a man must show his mettle to gain rec
ognition. In the records of athletic history we find men who developed
into stars after coming to college. The saying that a high school star
is a college flivver has been proven and disproven. However, in Stanford
every man starts from scratch. Prep school records are left for the
classes of the institution where your elementary education was acquired
to admire and to beat if possible. Every new student in Stanford starts
with an even break.
The first principle to observe in beginning your university career is
hard work. No man ever got very far) in any line if he spent his time
telling what he planned to do —what he was going to do tomorrow. It
is always the fellow who is doing today that achieves something sub
stantial for his Alma Mater tomorrow.
Your work you will find is divided into two great classes. Work
that you do in the class-rooms and for the class-rooms and physical
effort on the athletic fields or in some other activity. Pursue both of
these lines to the utmost. With their pursuit comes an understanding
of how this institution is run, what its ideals and traditions are, what
the goal is toward which Stanford is working. This understanding
once acquired, enables you to see just where you fit into the general
scheme of things—to see what line of endeavor you can enter in which
you will better yourself and aid the University, that is offering you a
first class education.
This knowledge does not come in a day, a week, nor a month.
Hard work every day during your first year will enable you to determine
your g'oah With your goal well in mind you can bend every effort in
the following years to its attainment. It is all in the start. Start well
and you will finish big. Aim always at the top in whatever field you
choose, then if you fall short of the top you are still a mighty good man.
