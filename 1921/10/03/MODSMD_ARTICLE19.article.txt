# STANFORD CONTINGENT PLEASES COMMANDANT
## 
### 
Camp Commandant, President of the
National R. O. T. C. Association, sev
eral commissioned officers and a large
representation of athletes were the
Cardinal's contribution to Camp* Knox,
in Kentucky, the summer training camp
for the collegiate reserve. Major Col
lins, who was in charge of the camp
during the last half of the summer
period, said that he was very proud of
the showing of the Stanford contingent
and that the group had established a
very good reputation.
F. D. Atkinson, '22, who is now in
structing at Boston Tech, captairred Bat
tery B. This was the battery which in
cluded the Stanford group, and was
lieutenanted by "Tex" Talbert and W.
A. B. Hayne. Art Christianson was the
high pistol shot of the bunch, and on
the first camp polo team Talbort played
throughout the season, which fact may
account, in part, for the clean sweep the
four made of its opponents. It is Tal
bert who will head the newly formed
national association. On the baseball
nine, which finished fourth in the league,
Cleaveland, Findley, Price, Talbert, and
Retticker had steady positions.
Last summer was the final convening
of the eastern camp for all colleges. In
the future there will be three campsâ€”
east, middle west, and west. The west
ern camp which will include the future
Stanford batteries, will probably be held
in Washington and will have the nu
merical limit removed %
