# CONFERENCE PARTY WILL FORM WELCOME TO WOMEN STUDENTS
## 
### 
On Tuesday evening the new women
students will be guests of honor at a
conference party to be held in the
Women's Clubhouse on the campus.
The affair has been planned in order to
give the five hundred an opportunity to
become better acquainted and to enable
them to meet Miss Mary Yost, the new
dean of women.
A stunt to be staged by the freshmen
women will be part of the evening's pro
gram, followed by dancing and light re
freshments. All women students are
cordially invited. The hour for the
party has been set at 7:30.
