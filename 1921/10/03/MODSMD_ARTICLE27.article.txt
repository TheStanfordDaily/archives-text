# NEVADA FOOTBALL MEN SUBMERGE AGNETIANS
## 
### 
On September 24, Nevada University
defeated the Agnetian Club of San
Francisco, 54 to 0, thereby drawing to
her team considerable interest and a
large amount of speculation as to the
position Nevada will occupy in Pacific
Coast football.
Nevada has the same backfield as last
year, and a line that averages 192
pounds. Hobbs and Martin at end and
Fisher at guard are the veterans in the
line, but the new men are showing good
early season teamwork.
