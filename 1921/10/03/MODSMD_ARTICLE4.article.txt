# Fabled Amphibian Monster From Utah At Large on Campus
## 
### 
Fair co-eds, be not frightened. Should
a strange animal of ung .inly appearance
and slow gait approach, pass it by; it's
harmless. Unnamed and unsung, and
wandering in the general direction of
*the deserts of Utah is a desert reptile,
or so 'tis characterized by its owners,
from whom in the still of the night it
escaped, and the stealthy perambulations
began.
This amphibian, since it left the
desert, monster at present roaming the
confines of the campus, is characterized
by its strange form and voice, having
feet like an elephant, a visage resembling
that of a turtle, and emitting upon occa
sion the ferocious roar of an oyster.
To finish, warning and supplication to
the denizens of the campus. The Phi
Kap tortoise, twelve inches long and
weighing fifteen pounds, has escaped.
Information leading to his detention and
recaptivation will be greatly appreciated
by the former owners of the mascot.
