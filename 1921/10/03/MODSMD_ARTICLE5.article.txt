# FORMAL RUSHING FOR FRATERNITIES TO END OCTOBER 26
## 
### 
Greek-letter fraternities will enter
formal bids for men registering as
freshmen in the University this quar
ter, on Sunday, October 30. The rush
ing season will close at midnight on
Wednesday, October 26. A meeting
of the Interfraternity Conference was
called by President Waiter Snook, for
tonight, but on account of the poster
fight has been postponed until next
Monday. However, rushing rules
which were in effect last year no doubt
will be substantially the same this
quarter.
The most important regulations con
cerning rushing are that no freshman
may live in a fraternity house for
more than one night a week or board
there steadily; that no freshman may
be pledged by a fraternity for which
he is working until one quarter after
he shall have ceased such work; and
that all rushing shall be restricted to
the campus and Palo Alto.
The fraternities will turn in their
lists of men three days prior to the
dÂ«v of extending bids, notice to be
sent by the lawyer the day following
to all freshmen who have bids, noti
fying them of the time and place to
appear before the lawyer.
There will be a second bidding date,
within a week after the first one, to
care for those freshmen who did not
appear on the first bidding date. After
this second bidding and not before
any freshman then eligible to be
pledged, may be pledged at any time
by any fraternity.
