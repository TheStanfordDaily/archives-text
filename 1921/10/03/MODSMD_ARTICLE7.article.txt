# FRESHMEN TAKE EASY GRID GAME
## Lowell High Tumbles Before Onslaught of Card Babes on Local Turfâ€”32-3 Score 
### 
Able to make gains at will through
the opposing line, the Cardinal babes
snowed under Lowell High on the Stan
ford turf Saturday afternoon in the first
grid game for the locals, by a score of
32 to 3. A bad start for Lowell in the
shape of a twenty-foot kick-off gave the
freshmen an early edge. Within two
minutes after the whistle 'the first seven
points of the season had been rolled up
for '25, and the outcome of the game
definitely settled. Lowell at times got
away for passes and long end runs,
once reaching the freshman twenty-yard
line, where a well-placed drop kick ac
counted for the prep school's scoring.
At no time was the local squad's goal
line menaced.
Long gains on end runs or neatly exe
cuted forward passes featured every
quarter. Gilliland at right half with two
dashes of forty yards through a broken
field scarcely led his teammates, How
ard, at left half, and Cuddeback, full, in
the matter of long runs. Gains of from
'ten to twenty-five yards were numerous,
in which tackles Shipke and Dole played
a prominent part. Dennis, at quarter
back, passed successfully to ends, Jans
sen and Wideman, for three gains over
twenty yards.
Penalties at the wrong times kept the
Cards from running up an even greater
score. Frequent substitutions were
made during the last half.
Lowell, in her first year of American
football, is not as weak as the score in
dicates. No high school ever ran up
against a freshman team like this one on
the Stanford turf. Right half Morri
and fullback F. Rankin starred for the
prep school squad.
Lowell booted the kick-off, and the
freshmen rushed them off their feet for
'three times the necessary yardage. On
Lowell's twenty-yard line, Dole scam
pered around left end for nineteen
yards, where Howard took possession of
the ball and took it into camp. Dennis
converted. Time, two minutes.
After a penalty for off-sides on the
kick-off, the freshmen were unable to
stop F. Rankin's thirty-yard return and
two following line plunges for six and
thre yards. Left half made five off
right end.
With the ball on their own forty
yard line, Lowell's pass was blocked and
two line plunges were stopped for a loss.
