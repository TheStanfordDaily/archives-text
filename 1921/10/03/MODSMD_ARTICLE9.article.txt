# VAN GENT'S GRIDDERS BREAK MINE MORALE IN FIRST HALF; 41-0 SCORE
## Doughty, Patrick And Wilcox Star In First Battle 
### E. C. West, 23 
It took the Stanford Varsity just -thirty minutes to demonstrate strength
Saturday against the United States Marines.
And in the course of that thirty minutes when the major portion of a score
of 41 to 0 was rolled up, hopes of the Card followers were raised from discourage
ment to optimism.
During the lirst half of the grid session Saturday, Stanford showed little but
a strong defensive. Opening up under pressure, Van Gent's squad tore the
Marines' line to shreds, circled the ends at will, and completed several forward
passes for material gains in 'the third and fourth periods.
It was a crimson-jerseyed athlete named Doughty who provided the bleacher
thrills in the second half. While he was in the game he demonstrated everything

that a halfback should have—speed, abil
ity to pick holes, and a knowledge of
broken field running. It was Doughty's
swerving, dodging gains of ten, fifteen,
and 'twenty yards that brought the fans
to their feet and broke the backbone of
the Marine defense. He was the out
standing star of the season's opener.
Close behind the elusive Doughty was
Jack Patrick, captain of the 1921
Varsity. Patrick dented the visitors'
line time after time and played well on
defense. His kicking was consistent.
Art Wilcox, skipper of the Card team
last year, was good for yards every time
he carried the ball. He showed ability
either to go through the line or circle
the ends.
Stanford kicked off to the Marines,
who ran the ball to their own forty-yard
line, where they were held for downs.
The Cards were unable to advance and
Patrick punted to the visitors' twenty
yard mark.
An exchange of punts followed, Pat
rick averaging about forty yards. The
Cards took the ball on their forty-yard
line and showed the first offensive of
the afternoon, only losing the ball on
downs when Shlaudeman's pass fell over
the goal line incomplete.
The period ended with the Marines in
possession of the ball on their own
twenty-yard line. They kicked, and the
Stanford march down the field was re
sumed.
It was the successful operation of the
forward pass that brought the first score
of the afternoon. Woodward caught
one for a gain of ten yards, and Mertz
nailed another and dodged his way over
the line. Patrick failed to convert.
That was all of the scoring during the
first half. Huffman of the Marines in
tercepted a Cardinal pass in the middle
of the field near the end of the half,
and scooted through the entire Stanford
team with the exception of Shlaudeman.
The Devil Dogs tried a drop which went
wild. That was the only 'time that the
Stanford goal was in danger.
Touchdowns in the second half were
frequent. Captain Jack Patrick went
over with the first, two minutes after
play had been resumed, after he and
Wilcox had worked the ball to the Ma
rine fifteen-yard line. Wilcox con
verted.
A Marine fumble on 'their twenty-tive
yard mark was turned into a Stanford
score soon afterward, Patrick again
carrying the ball. Wilcox converted,
making the score read: Stanford 20,
Marines 0.
Coach Van Gent rushed in many sub
stitutions during the last period, and the
Cardinal onslaught continued stronger
than ever. Three 'touchdowns in the
final fifteen minutes of play brought the
41-point total.
Doughty, sent into the game at half,
started his sensational dashes through
the big holes that the Card line was
making. He made the fourth touch
down and brought the ball to the thirty
yard line in two runs from where Wil
cox carried the ball over for the fifth.
Wilcox probably supplied the best bit
of individual work of the game in this
run when he edged his way through the
entire Marine defense, and eluding
tackier after tackier, carried the ball
thirty yards over the line.
Both touchdowns were converted.
Stanford was ready to drive over
again near the end of the game when the
Marines held for downs in the shadow
of their own goal and attempted to kick
the ball out of danger. Sproull blocked
the kick and "Scotchy" Campbell fell on
the ball for the last score just as the
game ended.

who ran the ball to their own forty-yard
line, where they were held for downs.
The Cards were unable to advance and
Patrick punted to the visitors' twenty
yard mark.
An exchange of punts followed, Pat
rick averaging about forty yards. The
Cards took the ball on their forty-yard
line and showed the first offensive of
the afternoon, only losing the ball on
downs when Shlaudeman's pass fell over
the goal line incomplete.
The period ended with the Marines in
possession of the ball on their own
twenty-yard line. They kicked, and the
Stanford march down the field was re
sumed.
It was the successful operation of the
forward pass that brought the first score
of the afternoon. Woodward caught
one for a gain of ten yards, and Mertz
nailed another and dodged his way over
the line. Patrick failed to convert.
That was all of the scoring during the
first half. Huffman of the Marines in
tercepted a Cardinal pass in the middle
of the field near the end of the half,
and scooted through the entire Stanford
team with the exception of Shlaudeman.
The Devil Dogs tried a drop which went
wild. That was the only 'time that the
Stanford goal was in danger.
Touchdowns in the second half were
frequent. Captain Jack Patrick went
over with the first, two minutes after
play had been resumed, after he and
Wilcox had worked the ball to the Ma
rine fifteen-yard line. Wilcox con
verted.
A Marine fumble on 'their twenty-tive
yard mark was turned into a Stanford
score soon afterward, Patrick again
carrying the ball. Wilcox converted,
making the score read: Stanford 20,
Marines 0.
Coach Van Gent rushed in many sub
stitutions during the last period, and the
Cardinal onslaught continued stronger
than ever. Three 'touchdowns in the
final fifteen minutes of play brought the
41-point total.
Doughty, sent into the game at half,
started his sensational dashes through
the big holes that the Card line was
making. He made the fourth touch
down and brought the ball to the thirty
yard line in two runs from where Wil
cox carried the ball over for the fifth.
Wilcox probably supplied the best bit
of individual work of the game in this
run when he edged his way through the
entire Marine defense, and eluding
tackier after tackier, carried the ball
thirty yards over the line.
Both touchdowns were converted.
Stanford was ready to drive over
again near the end of the game when the
Marines held for downs in the shadow
of their own goal and attempted to kick
the ball out of danger. Sproull blocked
the kick and "Scotchy" Campbell fell on
the ball for the last score just as the
game ended.

It took the Stanford Varsity just -thirty minutes to demonstrate strength
Saturday against the United States Marines.
And in the course of that thirty minutes when the major portion of a score
of 41 to 0 was rolled up, hopes of the Card followers were raised from discourage
ment to optimism.
During the lirst half of the grid session Saturday, Stanford showed little but
a strong defensive. Opening up under pressure, Van Gent's squad tore the
Marines' line to shreds, circled the ends at will, and completed several forward
passes for material gains in 'the third and fourth periods.
It was a crimson-jerseyed athlete named Doughty who provided the bleacher
thrills in the second half. While he was in the game he demonstrated everything

that a halfback should have—speed, abil
ity to pick holes, and a knowledge of
broken field running. It was Doughty's
swerving, dodging gains of ten, fifteen,
and 'twenty yards that brought the fans
to their feet and broke the backbone of
the Marine defense. He was the out
standing star of the season's opener.
Close behind the elusive Doughty was
Jack Patrick, captain of the 1921
Varsity. Patrick dented the visitors'
line time after time and played well on
defense. His kicking was consistent.
Art Wilcox, skipper of the Card team
last year, was good for yards every time
he carried the ball. He showed ability
either to go through the line or circle
the ends.

making the score read: Stanford 20,
Marines 0.
Coach Van Gent rushed in many sub
stitutions during the last period, and the
Cardinal onslaught continued stronger
than ever. Three 'touchdowns in the
final fifteen minutes of play brought the
41-point total.
Doughty, sent into the game at half,
started his sensational dashes through
the big holes that the Card line was
making. He made the fourth touch
down and brought the ball to the thirty
yard line in two runs from where Wil
cox carried the ball over for the fifth.
Wilcox probably supplied the best bit
of individual work of the game in this
run when he edged his way through the
entire Marine defense, and eluding
tackier after tackier, carried the ball
thirty yards over the line.
Both touchdowns were converted.
Stanford was ready to drive over
again near the end of the game when the
Marines held for downs in the shadow
of their own goal and attempted to kick
the ball out of danger. Sproull blocked
the kick and "Scotchy" Campbell fell on
the ball for the last score just as the
game ended.
