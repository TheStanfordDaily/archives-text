# VAN GENT'S GRIDDERS BREAK MINE MORALE IN FIRST HALF; 41-0 SCORE
## Doughty, Patrick And Wilcox Star In First Battle 
### E. C. West, 23 
It took the Stanford Varsity just -thirty minutes to demonstrate strength
Saturday against the United States Marines.
And in the course of that thirty minutes when the major portion of a score
of 41 to 0 was rolled up, hopes of the Card followers were raised from discourage
ment to optimism.
During the lirst half of the grid session Saturday, Stanford showed little but
a strong defensive. Opening up under pressure, Van Gent's squad tore the
Marines' line to shreds, circled the ends at will, and completed several forward
passes for material gains in 'the third and fourth periods.
It was a crimson-jerseyed athlete named Doughty who provided the bleacher
thrills in the second half. While he was in the game he demonstrated everything

that a halfback should haveâ€”speed, abil
ity to pick holes, and a knowledge of
broken field running. It was Doughty's
swerving, dodging gains of ten, fifteen,
and 'twenty yards that brought the fans
to their feet and broke the backbone of
the Marine defense. He was the out
standing star of the season's opener.
Close behind the elusive Doughty was
Jack Patrick, captain of the 1921
Varsity. Patrick dented the visitors'
line time after time and played well on
defense. His kicking was consistent.
Art Wilcox, skipper of the Card team
last year, was good for yards every time
he carried the ball. He showed ability
either to go through the line or circle
the ends.
Stanford kicked off to the Marines,
who ran the ball to their own forty-yard
line, where they were held for downs.
The Cards were unable to advance and
Patrick punted to the visitors' twenty
yard mark.
An exchange of punts followed, Pat
rick averaging about forty yards. The
Cards took the ball on their forty-yard
line and showed the first offensive of
the afternoon, only losing the ball on
downs when Shlaudeman's pass fell over
