Do You Need Additional
Money for College Expenses?
We have openings for several students to represent us in
Palo Alto. The work is dignified and remunerative, yet will
not conflict with class work.
In addition to enabling students to make money to help de
fray college expenses, this is an opportunity to get experi
ence that will be valuable in helping the successful applicants
decide their life work.
Write us fully, in confidence, giving age, experience, in detail,
course of study, and, if possible, enclose a post card photo. If
your application interests us a personal interview will be ar
ranged for.
