# NEW TYPE OF STOP WATCH IS GIVEN CHRISTE
## 
### Pacific Intercollegiate News Service 
Coach Walter Christie has received
a new stop-watch which will register
to the nearest tenth of a second. This
watch will be used in all California
track meets during the coming season
and it is probable that such time
pieces will come into general use
throughout the country.
Gustavus Kirby, a referee and mem
ber of the I. C. A. A. A. advisory
committee, is the donor. Mr. Kirby
and Coach Christie have been per
sonal friends for thirty years and the
gift was made "as a token of the high
esteem" in which the Bruin coach is
held.
Present style stop-watches register
to the nearest fifth of a second and
only give accurate time to within two
yards, but, this watch gives time which
allows error of only one yard.
Mr. Kirby is (recommending the
general use of such time-pieces in all
big track meets.
