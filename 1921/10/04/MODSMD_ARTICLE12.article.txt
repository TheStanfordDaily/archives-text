# '24 CUSS WINS POSTER BATTLE FROM FRESHMEN
## Classes Considerate of Each Other; Wait Five Minutes For Awful Wrath to Abate 
### Tom Irwin, '23 
In accordance with precedent, the
sophomore class carried off scant hon
ors in the annual poster tight with the
freshmen on the Row this morning at
4 o'clock. Despite the fact the incoming
men were deprived of eighty football
candidates, they kept many a wet poster
from greeting the eye of a scoffing cam
pus this morning. They came as near
winning the battle as freshmen ever did.
Led by C. J. Tauzer, '20, the babes
left their camp this morning at 3:30,
breathing death and defiance to their
oppressors and self-imposed "masters,"
the sophomores. The older class ar
rived on the scene of action a few mo
ments later, consigning at least twenty
five of their opponents to a place hotter
than comfortable.
Apparently both groups were held in
by cooler heads than usual after the
sounding of the starting gun, for five
minutes elapsed ere anybody saw action.
No doubt both factions realized that in
their wolfish frames of mind damage
would be done if no opportunity to cool
off were given. Or perhaps both were
waiting for the other to repair to the
warm place to which both were con
signed. At any rate, they failed to fly
at each other's throats as their fiendish
howls prophesied.
Action, however, was finally brought
about by the quick wit of upperclass
men who circled the throng of furious
but not as yet embattled urchins, and
exerted extreme pressure from the rear.
In this manner the two parties were
gradually urged toward each other and
made to carry out the threats they so
freely made.
Distribution of water between the two
classes for the first few moments was
rather unequal, the sophomores receiv
ing the larger amount via the esophagus
route. After the fight was about half
over the tide turned and submerged an
equally large number of freshmen.
Meanwhile, the poster committee dashed
madly up and down the country, slap
ping down the printed atrocities at ran
dom. In order to preserve their relics
in case of attack, the posters were en
trusted to Eddie Sudden. This would
indicate that '24 considers flight the
better part of valor.
The last thing in genteel class con
tests is promised on the Stanford turf
this afternoon, when the supposedly
belligerent factions will presumedly
tangle in the annual tie-up. Silk ribbons
may be used to truss up captives, ac
cording to a rumor current immediately
after the exchange of greetings on the
Row this morning. Football men will
not be allowed to participate less they
grow soft by refraining from usual ex
ercise. The incident is scheduled to
commence at 4 o'clock, lasting until par
ticipants are heard to breathe deeply.
