These teas are given every Wednes

bought with the money this year, and
the walls are to be tinted if possible.
The charge is twenty-five cents for

may be had at a dollar per table.
These can be arranged for by tele
phoning to Mrs. George Morrel in Palo

ing will not be held tomorrow as is
usual at the first affair, but will be
called for 3 o'clock Wednesday, Oc

sion, a reception will then be given
at 4 o'clock, in honor of Miss Yost,
and the new graduate students who
are on the campus for the first time
this year.
All alumni and former Stanford stu
dents in the vicinity are considered
members of the Alumni organization,
and they, as well as all other women
on the campus are invited to attend
the teas as often as possible. The
students in particular are asked to
drop in, as it is really for their bene
fit that the club house is kept up.
The association is anxious to have
these first two teas a success so that
the year may start out well, and
especially do they want a large attend
ance at the reception for Miss Yost,
and the new graduates.
