# ST. MARY'S WILL GIVE STANFORD TEAM REAL TEST
## Cardinal Followers Will be Given Chance to See Real Strength of Team Saturday 
### 
That Gene Van Gent and the rest of
the Card tanbark coaches care nothing
for inclement weather was evidenced
yesterday afternoon.
The entire varsity football squad was
out and the Stanford mentors put their
men through a severe signal drill and a
heavy workout just as if the sun were
shining down at 100 degrees.
The varsity will get its first real test
of the season Saturday, when tire St.
Mary's eleven comes here. Efforts to
have the game moved to Ewing field
have been unavailing, the Cardinal
coaches and Graduate Manager Fletcher
insisting that the affair should take
place on the Stanford field.
St. Mary's surprised every football
follower on the Coast a couple of weeks
ago when she held the "wonder team"
of California to a 21-0 score. The Bruins
took their game with the Catholics last
year 127-0, establishing a record score
for the Pacific Coast.
Dopesters ever since this year's game
have been trying to figure whether the
Bruins are that much weaker or whether
St. Mary's has improved considerably
under the tutilage of "Flash" Madigan.
At any rate Stanford grid followers
will be enabled to get a line on the
respective merits of the two rival var
sities in less than a week.
Stanford proved against the Marines
that she had an offensive. Doughty,
Wilcox, Patrick and Shlaudeman all
looked to be in mid-season form when
the second half march got under way.
The open game played by Van Gent's
team possibly presages a forward pass
offensive, for Van Gent has two men in
"Bud" Woodward and Bob Shlaudeman
who can pass with extreme accuracy.
What kind of a defense the Card
line and ends will be to offer against a
stronger combination than the Marines
will be answered Saturday, for the St.
Mary's backs looked fast against Cali
fornia even if they were slow to get
their plays started. Football fans will
remember the work of little Kuahane at
half who is a dangerous broken field
runner once he gets under way.
In the line Stanford with five or six
available candidates balancing the scales
at more than two hundred pounds, will
outweigh the St. Mary's defense.
Will the Card line be able to shatter
St. Mary's as it did the Marines? Will
the speedy Stanford backs be able to
use such an offensive as they did last
week? How docs Van Gent's squad
compare this early in the season with
Andy Smith's California "wonder team ?"
Those questions will be answered on
the Stanford turf Saturday.

The open game played by Van Gent's
team possibly presages a forward pass
offensive, for Van Gent has two men in
"Bud" Woodward and Bob Shlaudeman
who can pass with extreme accuracy.
What kind of a defense the Card
line and ends will be to offer against a
stronger combination than the Marines
will be answered Saturday, for the St.
Mary's backs looked fast against Cali
fornia even if they were slow to get
their plays started. Football fans will
remember the work of little Kuahane at
half who is a dangerous broken field
runner once he gets under way.
In the line Stanford with five or six
available candidates balancing the scales
at more than two hundred pounds, will
outweigh the St. Mary's defense.
Will the Card line be able to shatter
St. Mary's as it did the Marines? Will
the speedy Stanford backs be able to
use such an offensive as they did last
week? How docs Van Gent's squad
compare this early in the season with
Andy Smith's California "wonder team ?"
Those questions will be answered on
the Stanford turf Saturday.
