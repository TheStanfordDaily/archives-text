One of the football tackles was heard to say the other day, "The
Board of Athletic Control is certainly on the job." How true his re
mark was he himself probably did not realize at the time.
With the end of the school year in June most of the student problems
had been met and disposed of. The work of student officials and the
students being finished they hied themselves home or elsewhere to spend
the summer months. But the work of the Board of Athletic Control did
not end on June 15. The members remained on the job throughout the
vacation period, performing invaluable services to the University.
The stadium was just in the beginning stages of construction on
June 15 last. The multitude of details in regard to contracts, labor, the
campaign drive for funds, the matter of money for the contractors, and
a multitude of minor details had to be arranged. The Board of Control
took care of the entire stadium project during the vacation period.
During the summer Edward R. Martin resigned as Graduate Man
ager. Immediately it was realized that a valuable man was lost to the
University. The Board -sought a man who could fill the position left
vacant by Martin's resignation. They, found him in the person of Wil
liam R. Fletcher, an alumnus of the class of '11, who took over the super -
vision of athletic affairs, which is the chief function of the Graduate
Manager's office, with scarcely an interruption. Fletcher has already
shown that he is the ideal man for the position, and he has made friends
of everyone with whom he has dealt both in and out of the University.
The resignation of Walter Powell as football coach to assume the
direction of Major Athletics necessitated the appointment of a man to
handle the football squad from which a team is to be chosen to meet
California in the first game in the new stadium. Instead of securing a
oach the Board of Control went right out and gathered in the most com
lete and apparently the most efficient set of football mentors that Stan
jrd has ever had. Gene Van Gent, formerly of the University of Wis
>nsin, a man with a record for building winning teams, was chosen head
>ach. Joe Fitzgerald, who played quarterback on the Harvard eleven
st season, was picked to handle the backfield men. -From our own
culty Professor John B. Canning was recruited to impart football
lowledge to the linemen, and "Dink'' Templeton, than whom there are
w greater kickers in football today, was given the job of teaching the
en the art of punting, drop and place kicking.
The students returned to the campus to find that all of these things
id been done during their absence. A word of appreciation is due to
ie alumni, faculty, and student members of the Board of Athletic Con
ol who so faithfully performed these services for the good of Stanford.
The members of the Board of Control who were active during the
immer in the work performed are Dr. T. M. Williams, Leland Cutler,

ol who so faithfully performed these services for the good of Stanford.
The members of the Board of Control who were active during the
immer in the work performed are Dr. T. M. Williams, Leland Cutler,
id Richard Barrett, alumni members; Professor A. T. Murray, Pro
:ssor J. P. Mitchell, and Walter D. Powell, faculty members; Jack
'atrick, lames Petrini, and William F. Leiser, student members.
One of the football tackles was heard to say the other day, "The
Board of Athletic Control is certainly on the job." How true his re
mark was he himself probably did not realize at the time.
With the end of the school year in June most of the student problems
had been met and disposed of. The work of student officials and the
students being finished they hied themselves home or elsewhere to spend
the summer months. But the work of the Board of Athletic Control did
not end on June 15. The members remained on the job throughout the
vacation period, performing invaluable services to the University.
The stadium was just in the beginning stages of construction on
June 15 last. The multitude of details in regard to contracts, labor, the
campaign drive for funds, the matter of money for the contractors, and
a multitude of minor details had to be arranged. The Board of Control
took care of the entire stadium project during the vacation period.
During the summer Edward R. Martin resigned as Graduate Man
ager. Immediately it was realized that a valuable man was lost to the
University. The Board -sought a man who could fill the position left
vacant by Martin's resignation. They, found him in the person of Wil
liam R. Fletcher, an alumnus of the class of '11, who took over the super -
vision of athletic affairs, which is the chief function of the Graduate
Manager's office, with scarcely an interruption. Fletcher has already
shown that he is the ideal man for the position, and he has made friends
of everyone with whom he has dealt both in and out of the University.
The resignation of Walter Powell as football coach to assume the
direction of Major Athletics necessitated the appointment of a man to
handle the football squad from which a team is to be chosen to meet
California in the first game in the new stadium. Instead of securing a
oach the Board of Control went right out and gathered in the most com
lete and apparently the most efficient set of football mentors that Stan
jrd has ever had. Gene Van Gent, formerly of the University of Wis
>nsin, a man with a record for building winning teams, was chosen head
>ach. Joe Fitzgerald, who played quarterback on the Harvard eleven
st season, was picked to handle the backfield men. -From our own
culty Professor John B. Canning was recruited to impart football
lowledge to the linemen, and "Dink'' Templeton, than whom there are
w greater kickers in football today, was given the job of teaching the
en the art of punting, drop and place kicking.
The students returned to the campus to find that all of these things
id been done during their absence. A word of appreciation is due to
ie alumni, faculty, and student members of the Board of Athletic Con
ol who so faithfully performed these services for the good of Stanford.
