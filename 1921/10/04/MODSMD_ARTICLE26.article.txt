Filled with spirits to the point of
overflowing as well as with a desire to
pester Daily readers, the entire Cab
bage staff returns to the fold intact.
Some may come and some stay bum
but we bum 011 forever. —Locksmith.

California is now salubriously and
lagubriously chanting, "Be a Stadium
Builder." The Cardinal wancry is
"Be a Stadium Filler."
* * *
Of course, that makes things look
bad for the Golden Grizzly.
* * *
Contributors to the Bowl have the
satisfaction of knowing that they're
the guys that put the aid in Stadium.
* * *
Unless the Frosh are dealt their
death blow by a couple of glances at
the Soph skv-piece, about eighty red
shirted devils are going to make Cali
fornia feel at home in the Big Little
Game.
* * *
That piece of millinery decorating
jthe domes of the double-dozen class
looks like the work of a character
from "Alice in Wonderland." Anyway,
j it's the work of a Mad Hatter.
* * *
Yea, the Soph atrocity will have to
Ibe blocked pretty often. It ought to
j have been blocked before the order
j was sent in.
* * *
This is the year of hustlers. Every
i one is hustling and bustling about
getting everything lined up for a fine
fat year. Somebody hustled the arm
chair out of our study.

We're hustlers, too. We'd only had
it two days.

advent of red-blooded men.)

Owing to the high price of fruit this
restaurant has been serving stale cab

ers may substitute Want Ads a la pi.
Judging by the* intelligence test
blanks in the registration books, the
authorities are optimistic enough to
believe that a gleam of reason may
shine through the intellectual dark
ness of the new class. At any rate,
they shall see the glitter of the white
hat at the end of a stormy period of
darkness.

"The Big Game of the Pacific Coast
will be between California and U. S.
C." —Paddock in Los Angeles paper.
How Western football has fallen! Oh,
Beth, where is thy sting?
* * *
Imagine a MARINE jumping at the
sound of a gun! And in peace time,
too. A butcher could with equal rea- I
son leap at the sight of a cleaver.
* * *
Yell leader remarked, "Let's give
three for Another one." Been funny
if they had.
* * *
"Brick" Morse ended a recent story
with the announcement that he and
his only friend, a dog, were going to
end it all by parking in thirty feet of j
bay water. Thirty feet is evidently
insufficient.
* * *
