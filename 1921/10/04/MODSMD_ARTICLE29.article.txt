# COACH JOE MURPHY EXPECTS BIG LIST OF RING TRYOUTEES
## 
### 
Coach Murphy is getting ready this
year for one of the largest boxing en
rollments on record, and all the dope
points toward another successful year
for the Cardinal ring artists. Murphy
wants all men who have had any ex
perience in boxing, whether they in
tend to sign up for it this quarter or
not, to report at once so that he can
keep a line on them.
Boxing and swimming are the only
two sports that California lost in
last year. The Bruins are changing
their boxing coach from Bobbie John
son to Bobbie Webster, evidently with
the hope of taking the Cardinal scalp.

Jimmy Cliue, the much-touted Bruin
boxer, is back in camp this season
and Coach Murphy ventures the pre
diction that he may face Cline again
this year.
Jimmy Ross, lightweight; Harley
1 Carter, heavyweight, and Warren Ken
nedy, heavyweight, are back on the
campus and more of the squad are
sure to report in within the next few
' days. Coach Murphy has decided to
, hold classes every day for the week
for beginners, between the hours of
4 and 6 p.m.

An announcement has come from the
graduate manager's office to the effect
that several positions are still open to
junior and sophomore assistants to the
football manager.
This gives men who are interested
only in spring athletics to do something
for themselves and for Stanford.
