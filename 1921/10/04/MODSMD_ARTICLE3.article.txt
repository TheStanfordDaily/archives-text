# ENROLLMENT IS LARGE AT ROBLE GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
Registration in the women's gym
nasium has reached the three-hundred
mark, and classes are rapidly being
filled in the various lines of sport
which are being offered this quarter.
Hockey has thus far proved the most
popular field of activity and many
upper division women have registered,
so that no trouble is anticipated in
selecting full class teams for the
games, which will be scheduled for the
last part of the quarter.
Roble gymnasium has lost one of its
most popular instructors in the person
of Miss Allen, who left during the sum
mer for Wellesley College, where she
has registered for graduate work. She
is not expecting to return to Stanford.
Miss Etfith Patmore, from the Uni
versity of California is now a member
of the local gymnasium staff, and will
be instructor in dancing and hockey
during the autumn quarter. She is
also registered in the medical depart
ment and will continue her studies
while at Stanford. While at the state
university, Miss Pasmore was noted
for her excellence in hockey and
fencing.
