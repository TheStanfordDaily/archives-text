Construction 011 the Stanford Com
mons, and the Basketball Pavilion has
rounded the turn and is racing down
the home stretch. Besides these build
ing ventures, six new tennis courts
have been completed opposite the
new pavilion and a road has been put
through between Encina Hall and the
junction of the Embareadero and the
Highway, passing the Stadium.
The Basketball Pavilion will easily
be finished in time for practice. Roof
ing is being laid now and the lloor and
equipment is all that is left for in
stallation. Brick similar to that which
the gymnasium is built of has been
used. The space has been arranged so
dances may be conveniently given.
Kitchen room as well as dressing
room has been provided,
j Comptroller Roth hopes to have the
Commons dining room open by Janu
ary first. If the building tie-up clears
up, he will be safe in promising it, for
the construction has proceeded under
the greatest difficulties all summer.
Tennis will receive quite a boost
from the new courts for they are the
best appointed of any about the uni
versity. They are asphalt floored and
have a galvanized fence system about
them. The wrinkles of age have
naturally not invaded their smoothness
| yet, but perhaps the championship'
; material here-abouts will not have to
learn the game over again 011 account
of the peculiarity.
Roads have a new standard in gravel
in the new Encina-Stadium stretch.
It is wide and bumpless, not to men
tion the fact that it is handier than
Palm Drive for southern travel.
