# THE 						COCKTAIL WINS

"Hooch of the evening, beautiful,
beautiful hooch," carolled Mr. John
Doe under his breath, paraphrasing
the famous mock turtle song of Alice
in Wonderland. And he breezed into
the grocery store.
"Gimme 3 yeast cakes," he asked
the groces, "just three nice little yeast
cakes."
"You're just in time to get the last
3 in the box."
"Is that so? Can't you keep yeast
cakes enough to go 'round, hey?"
"Well, today was extra heavy, and
yeast is my best seller now. They buy
it by the dozen."
"By the dozen? What for? Three
is enough for one batch. No good in
flooding the house."
"Well, people don't get it just for
hooch, you know, sir. Don't you read
the papers. Everybody's eatin' it for
their health."
"Oh, you're kidding. Yeast for
health. That's good! I'll drink to
yours when my new brew is ready."
"Why how nice of John," his wife
thought. "He must have read that in
teresting piece in the paper about
yeast. And it said to take 1 to 3
cakes a day before meals in fruit
juice or water or milk. Oh, I know,
I'll fix a yeast cocktail for him. He'll
be so pleased."
So when John came to table there
were 2 nice orange-juice cocktail, very
cold, and with a pleasant taste that
he didn't think was entirely due to the
orange.
"What have you got here?" He
asked abruptly.
"Why John the yeast cakes you
brought?" "Don't you like it?"
"Like it!" roared Mr. Doe. "You've
spoiled my hooch, that's what you've
done. What do I want to take yeast
