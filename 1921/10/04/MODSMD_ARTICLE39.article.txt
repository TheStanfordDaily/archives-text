### 
With all his old men back,' except
Mills, Coach Brandsten is getting
under way for one of the most suc
cessful swimming seasons in Cardinal
history. For the sprints he has D ake,
C. Austin, A. Austin, and Macconel,
men who have been proving their
ability for several years. In the dis
tance there are Greppin, "Sol" Miller,
Hirschman, and Schlesinger. Charlie
Fletcher, Blake Wilbur, and DeGroot
for the back stroke, and Landis, Ken
nedy, and E. F. Miller in the plunge
for distance.
C. E. Pinkston, '23, winner of the
1920 World's Championship at Ant
werp, and holder of four National
championships in spring board and
high diving, is back in college this
year, and with him have come diving
laurels for Stanford. Snedden and
White will work with Pinkston and are
both capable divers.
Coach Brandsten believes that the
intramural water polo tournament
held during tne last spring quarter
developed more players than the regu
lar practice of the last five years.
There were fifteen teams going, with
seven men in each team, giving an op
portunity to pick material from over
one hundred candidates.
Every man on the Varsity water
polo team is back and in good shape
for work. The old line-up was Jack
Strauss, Bert Stearns, Norris Welsh,
E. Austin, Earle Thomas, John Ankele,
and Lorin LacÂ«y. ; ,iv'
Prospects for competition with other
schools look promising and a Pacific
Coast Conference meet seems likely.
Both Oregon State and the Oregon
Aggies have completed new tanks and
are taking up swimming as an inter
collegiate sportt. It is rumored that
Oregon State is planning to invite
other colleges on the Coast to a big
meet which will be held the day of
the official opening of its tank.
Coach Brandsten will take his men
on the annual trip to Los Angeles dur
ing the spring vacation, and there
are strong possibilities for trips to
Honolulu and Vancouver, B.C.
