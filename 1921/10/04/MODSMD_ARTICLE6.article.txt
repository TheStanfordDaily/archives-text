# STANFORD BABES PLAY TWO GAMES SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman football team will
line up against two teams this week
end, the first game being with the fast
Berkeley high school eleven on Satur
day morning at 10:30. In the afternoon
they will be pitted against the Salinas
high school squad. With two stiff games
on his schedule for Saturday, Coach
Seay will probably use a number of sub
stitutes in each game, giving everyone
a chance to make good.
The Berkeley squad has made a good
record during the past two years and is
looked upon to give the Cardinal babes
a hard battle Saturday. Coach Seay
will probably send his strongest lineup
against the trans-bay eleven, giving the
second squad an opportunity to show up
against the Salinas squad.
In the game with Lowell High School
last Saturday, the Babes showed a lack
of teamwork, due mainly to the fact that
it was the first time they had been to
gether. However, this defect should dis
appear with practice, and Saturday's
games promise to show a big improve
ment in the work of the freshman
eleven.
The backfield of Dennis, Morris, Gil
liland, and Cuddeback has been showing
up well in practice and appear to be a
fixture in the lineup. However, first
class competition has been giving them
a battle for their positions, and with
plenty of material, Coach Seay should
be able to turn out a winning combina
tion this year. Janssen is also putting
up a great fight for the job at end, while
Shipke and Dole are looking good at
both tackle positions.
