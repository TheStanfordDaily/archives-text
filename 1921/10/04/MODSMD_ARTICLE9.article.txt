Stanford's new Varsity tennis courts
will be officially dedicated with their
completion sometime in the latter part
of the month by a special exhibition
match by some of the leading players of
the world. Among the racquet men who
have been obtained for the opening of
the new courts are the Japanese Davis
cup players, who have been playing in
extensive tournaments in the East dur
ing the past summer. The Japanese
team is now on its way to San Francisco,
and have agreed to play on the Cardinal
courts as one of their exhibition matches
on the Coast.
The Japanese team is composed of
Zenzo Shimidzu and Ichiya Kumagae.
Earlier in the summer this combination
won the right to challenge the United
States Davis cup team by defeating all
opposition, and in their matches last Au
gust at Forest Hills with the American
title holders, Johnson and Tilden, at
tracted world-wide attention. The turn
out at the exhibition matches last spring
when Johnson and Davis played here,
proved the demand for high class tennis
exhibitions at Stanford, and arrange
ments are,being made to accommodate
a large crowd.
