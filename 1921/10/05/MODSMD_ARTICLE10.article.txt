# VARSITY SQUAD IS PUT THROUGH STIFF WORKOUT
## Cardinal Coach Shaping Men for Next Saturday's Battle With St. Mary's Gridders 
### 
Scrimmage that lasted over an hour
was on the menu for the Stanford foot
ball varsity squad last night. *
The Card coaches picked out two
teams and had them go the limit. As
sistant Mentor Joe Fitzgerald and Line
Coach J. B. Canning looked after the
first string eleven. "Dink' Templeton
was in charge of the seconds. Gene Van
Gent supervised it all.
• Before darkness called a halt to the
proceedings both teams had scored
twice. The first stringers carried the
ball for a couple of touchdowns and
Templeton's cohorts went over once and
scored a field goal.
Glen Hartranft, who played tackle
with the 1924 team, broke into the game
last night at end long enough to look
good. Hartranft weighs about 185
pounds and is fast.
Benninger, who was also a member of
the 1924 squad, showed plenty of class
last night at half for the second string
team. He was hitting low and hard, and
several times went through for good
yardage.
The fans in the bleachers were im
pressed with the way Captain jack Pat
rick was getting off his punts. Two of
his boots went fully fifty-live yards, and
his average was about fifty yards.
Indications today are that the Card
team will be in good shape for the im
portant St. Mary's battle here Satur
day. Van Gent will probably taper off
on his heavy scrimmage tomorrow, sig
nal drill predominating.
Reports from football circles tend to
show that the Stanford bleachers will
be packed for Saturday's affair, as grid
followers are anxious to see what the
1921 Cardinal varsity will do against
the team that threw a scare into the
Bruin camp at Berkeley.
Last year's struggle between St.
Mary's and Stanford resulted in a 41-
to-4 win for the Cards. There seems
little doubt but that Saturday's game
will be very much closer.
