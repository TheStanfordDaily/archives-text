# FRESHEN LOSE TO WHITE HATS IN FAST TIE-UP
## Sophomores Fiil Bull-Pen in First Few Minutes; Succor of No Avail to Youngsters 
### Tom Irwin, '23 
Completely surrounded and outclassed
by the sophomores, '25 was the victim
of a stirring defeat in the annual tie-up
on the Stanford diamond yesterday. In
tlie tirst place, outnumbered and out
weighed, as well as outgeneraled, the
new clas.» was unable to dig a very big
hole in the opposing wall, and when
help came from the ranks of Coach
Scay's gridmen, freshman morale was
at a low ebb and all chance for victory
went by the board.
The light at the start was uneven.
More sophomores showed up 011 the
battlefield than the freshmen thought
ever existed. And so wild was the on
slaught of the older class that fresh
man efforts to pen up victims were as
nothing. The ranks of '25 were sadly
decimated in the first five minutes of
tussling. Coach Seay, observing the bad
state of affairs, threw his reserve force
of red-shirted. shock troops into the
ever-widening breach and momentarily
turned the tide of battle. A counter at
tack by the incensed sophomores at this
point ended with most of the shock
troops shocking the inmates of the bull
pen.
It is safe to say that less than a score
of freshmen remained at large at the
end of the twenty-minute struggle. Had
all captives been retained, the sopho
mores would have come off the held
unanimously victorious. An attempt by
a few members of '25 to serpentine was
gra.ited scant toleration.
Tomorrow will be a field day for the
rag man.
