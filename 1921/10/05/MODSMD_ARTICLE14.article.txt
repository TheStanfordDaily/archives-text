# FALL ORGAN RECITALS BEGIN NEXT SUNDAY IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
The organ recitals for the autumn
quarter at Stanford University begin
ne'xt Sunday, October 9th, at 4 p.m.,
in the Memorial Church. Warren D.
Allen, University Organist, will play
the great "Passacaglia" by Bach, an
arrangement of Schubert's beautiful
melody, "Litany," and other numbers.
The musical services in the Me
morial Church promise to be of more
than usual interest this term. Several
soloists of note will appear occasion
ally at the Sunday recitals, assisting
Mr. Allen, and special music by the
choir will be featured from time to
time, culminating in the performance
(for the first time in the West) of
Horatio Parker's beautiful miracle
play and "The Dream of
Mary." The latter will be given in
December with an augmented choir
and members of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra.
A campaign for a fund to rebulid
the organ In the Memorial Church is
to be stressed this year in Stanford's
program of musical activities. The
Stanford organ is now twenty years
old. Although it has given delight to
many thousands, and is still justly
celebrated for its exquisite tone, ex
perts and others realize that the in
strument is greatly in need of mo
dernization mechanically, and that ex
tensive additions are necessary to
make the organ wholly adequate and
comparable to the magnificent modern
instruments at Yale, Cornell, and other
universities.
