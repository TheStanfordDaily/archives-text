# BABES WORK HARD FOR SATURDAY
## 
### 
Following the fight on the baseball
field yesterday afternoon, Coach Duffy
Seay put his charges through a light
scrimmage preparatory for the double
header on Saturday. Under the guid
ance of Coaches Mullarkey and Cravens,
supervised by Duffy Seay, both the first
and second string freshmen squads were
given a heavy signal practice.
Saturday, the Cardinal Babes will face
the Berkeley High School eleven in the
morning while the afternoon battle with
the Salinas High School squad will be
a curtain raiser for the Varsity game
with the fast St. Mary's crowd. Last
year, the Berkeley Higli team was
runner-up for the state championship,
and according to the dope received, the
transbay eleven is much stronger than
it was last season. The Salinas squad
is also reported to be strong this year
imd should make Coach Seay's men
work.
Van Hook at center for the Fresh
men has been showing up well during
the week and will probably be Coach
Seay's choice to start both games Satur
day. Van Hook is one of the heaviest
men on the line and has proven a good
man on defense. Neil and Crook at
guards are also going well and should
make themselves heard from in the
games this week-end.
Coach Seay has a fast backfield in
the combination of Dennis, Gilliland,
Howard, and Cuddeback, and with a
little more practice together, will prove
a hard quintet to stop. Dennis has been
playing at quarter and has proven a
capable man in running the team.
