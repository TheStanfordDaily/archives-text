# THE 						INCREASED REGISTRATION
## 
### 
Figures on registration released by the Registrar's Office indicate
an increase of 'almost 300 students over the number registered at this
time last year. The number of new students who may enter in the
autumn quarter is larger than in any other quarter of the year, but it is
limited. New students who registered for the summer have been counted
in this quota. The 299 students registered in excess of last year are
students who have been out for one or more quarters and are now com
ing back to complete their educations. The proportion of old students re
turning is larger this year than ever before.
Stanford can take care of an expansion of the student body in
definitely if it is not brought about by an increase in the number of new
students. The present increased registration, due to the return of for
mer students, is the sort that the University wants and can care for best.
There is cause of satisfaction that men who have begun here con
tinue their courses in greater proportion than ever before, and that men
who have been away for a time come back again. Their return indi
cates that we are all making good and that Stanford is fulfilling the pur
poses for which it was founded. Also it ensures a large student body
instilled with Stanford ideals.
Some have expressed fears in the past that the increased tuition,
coupled with the present athletic prowess of the University of California,
would tend to keep the working student, the fellow who earns all or part
of the money for his education, and the high school athlete, from coming
to Stanford. It was thought that Stanford would inherit a class of new
students who were puny and thin-chested, wore rubber-tired spectacles,
and hand a penchant for chess and tiddledy-winks.
This has not been the case. The class of new students includes the
normal number of men who must earn their way. Despite the increased
tuition these men have elected to make Stanford their Alma Mater. In
stead of the class of pampered weaklings which many thought would
register, Stanford has again drawn its full quota of red-blooded fellows
who will fight and work for the institution and for themselves.
