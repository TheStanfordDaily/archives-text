# Another Viewpoint

### 
This column presents today the view
point of one who was a participant in
the poster figlit on Monday night. It is
prejudiced possibly for that reason. The
Daily handled the story from the un
biased standpoint of an onlooker. While
this column is maintained primarily for
publishing community viewpoint on
matters of some import, complaints in
this tone are ordinarily disregarded.
However, we publish the following for
what it is worth. Possibly some of the
campus community will note with some
pleasure the evidence of spirit on the
part of at least one member of the class
of '24.â€”The Editor.
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
I wish to extend my hearty congratu
lations. The Daily Palo Alto has
reached the point where it may be
ranked with the leading metropolitan
dailies. In fact, it leads the rankest.
The city sheets have gained a reputation,
through long and sincere effort, for
garbling the truth to meet their own
ends; but it remains for the D. P. A. to
carry out the garbage to its ultimate
end.
To the young reporter' who was as
signed to the poster fight, all credit (or
beer checks) must be given for possess
ing one of the most fertile, not to say
decomposed, brains extant. His ac
count of the late hostilities rivals the
best work of such famous journalists as
Wm. R. Hearst, Capt. Billy, Baron Mun
chausen, etc.
But perhaps T misjudge the gentle
man. Perhaps he did not leave his
comfy cabbage bed. Perhaps he did not
care to spoil his beauty sleep, and in
stead gathered the information from a
nice obliging representative of the class
of 1925. No doubt many freshmen
bubbled over with information.
Then again, our hero may have for
gotten the orders of the light commit
tee. Perhaps he did not even know
anything (as usual) of tlie whistle which
was to start the fray, after the gun was
tired. However, his ability is unques
tioned. So was Ananias'.
His overlooking such a trifling inci
dent as the capture of the frosli drinking
fountains is natural. It is unreasonable
to expect undivided attention to he given
to front lawn bathing when sorority
upper windows are lit.
Again, Mr. Editor, allow me to con
gratulate you.
(Signed) W. E. P>.. 24.
