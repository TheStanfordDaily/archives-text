LEGE, CORVALLIS, Oct. 5.â€” J. Jou
bei)t, from Western Cape Provinces,
South Africa, has come more than
12,000 miles to register as a senior in
i the college school of agriculture. He
| is majoring in horticulture and conies
| with advanced standing, having studied
two and a half years at the University
of Stellenbosch, South Africa. He ex
pects to return to his native land, where
lie will put the knowledge gained at
(). A. C. into practice on a farm of his
own. It is possible that he will spend
a year in practical farming in this coun
! try, however, before returning.
Mr. Joubert left Africa with six- other
I students, some of whom stopped in
j England, and some in New York. He
says that many students from his prov
ince go to England and Scotland.
The South African indicated that he
was surprised to find that the work in
horticulture at the college was carried
on in such a thorough manner and on
such a large scale.
A bright future for the commercial
horticultural industry in South Africa
is predicted by Mr. Joubert.
"Export trade has been increasing
j rapidly in reccnt years in the western
province," lie said. "While many of
the farmers are conservative and stick
to old methods, and others go to the
extreme in carrying out new ideas, as a
whole the fruit growers are progress
; ive and desirous of adopting the latest
| scientific methods."
