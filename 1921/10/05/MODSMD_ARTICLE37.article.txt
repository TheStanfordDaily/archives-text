# WASHINGTON ELEVEN HAS COACH WORRIED; OTHERS OPTIMISTIC
## 
### Pacific Intercollegiate News Service 
University of Washington, Oct. 4. â€”
Opinions clash here as to the chances
of Washington's football team to cut
a big figure in the conference this
season. The students seem to be of
the opinion that Washington's eleven
will be formidable, but Coach Enoch
Bagshaw, the new coach, is even more
conservative than his reputation has
been in the past. "Pretty slim pick
ings" is the way he expresses the
varsity chances for the season. The
other conference teaems are watching
with interest to see just how this dark
horse team turns out, as upon its con
dition, more than one place in the
race will hinge. The first chance to
observe practical results comes Satur
day, when Washington hooks up Whit
man inthenew stadium.
