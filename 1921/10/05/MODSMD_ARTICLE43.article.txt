# California Editor Asks Why Women Go to College
## 
### 
"Intellectually (judging by scholar
ship records) the college woman Is ;
superior to the college male. She has !
apparently emerged from an era of j
j helplessness and has shown that she
is fully capable of doing things which
! men have done.
"But why does she come eto college?
To acquire ea breadth of vision which
centuries have kept from her? To fit j
herself for a career? Or simply to
secure a general culture, which shall 1
fit her to assume esocial leadership?
"One college woman, prominent in
activities, puts it thus.
'Women come to college for the
same reason that men do —to secure
a broad, general education which shall
fit them for life after college.'
"The average college man would
say, "The co-oils either came to col
lege to find a husband, or to learn
how to teach school.'"

Good looks is within the reach of
even the most impecunious of mortals,
if the secret recently revealed by a stage
star of peerless beauty is without ques
tion.
Dorothy Dalton, favorite of the stage
and screen, declares that she eats plain
everyday compressed yeast for beauty
and health. "
Tt lias long been a popular tenet that
(the beautiful women of the stage, hand
over to beauty specialists, a goodly por
tion of their fabulous incomes to pre
serve that priceless gift of physical
charm that is their fortune, and that
they spend their leisure hours in the
torturous hands of these professional
molders of grace to have their com
plexions steamed and creamed, mas
saged and plastered. In other words,
it has always been believed that beauty
costs time, money and many discom
forts.
But Dorothy Dalton completely over
throws the beauty parlor allusion when
she says that her beauty is sustained at
the expenditure of a few cents a day.
and that her remedy does not come from
the perfumed parlors of the Parisienne
Salon de Beaute, but from "the little
grpcery store around the corner."
"The use of compressed yeast is a
part of my daily routine. I have used
it for several years, and externally as a
complexion cleanser, says Miss Dalton,
when she revealed the secret to a few
of her friends.
Dorothy Dalton has many devotees
of both sexes, both from the footlights
and through the cinema, because of her
pulchritude. As Chrisis in Aphrodite,
her beauty is so entrancing that she
leads a virtuous young poet to steal,
murder and finally desecrate the sacred
Goddess Aphrodite to satisfy her vanity.

saged and plastered. In other words,
it has always been believed that beauty
costs time, money and many discom
forts.
But Dorothy Dalton completely over
throws the beauty parlor allusion when
she says that her beauty is sustained at
the expenditure of a few cents a day.
and that her remedy does not come from
the perfumed parlors of the Parisienne
Salon de Beaute, but from "the little
grpcery store around the corner."
"The use of compressed yeast is a
part of my daily routine. I have used
it for several years, and externally as a
complexion cleanser, says Miss Dalton,
when she revealed the secret to a few
of her friends.
Dorothy Dalton has many devotees
of both sexes, both from the footlights
and through the cinema, because of her
pulchritude. As Chrisis in Aphrodite,
her beauty is so entrancing that she
leads a virtuous young poet to steal,
murder and finally desecrate the sacred
Goddess Aphrodite to satisfy her vanity.
