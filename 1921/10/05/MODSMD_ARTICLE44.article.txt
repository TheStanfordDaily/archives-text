# "Old Nesl," at Varsity
## 
### 
"The Old Nest," by Rupert Hughes,
a Goldwyn picture, is at the Varsity
Theater for tonight and Thursday. The
picture is perhaps the richest in per
sonalities that has been placed be
fore the public in many a season.
M. N. (Lefty) Flynn, the famous
Yale football line plunger, will be
among the principles of the cast.
"Lefty's" career since college days has
included cowpunching, fruit ranching,
and cattle breeding. Ho has determin
ed to stick with the "movies" here
after.
A Harold Lloyd comedy with Hebe
Daniels and "Snub" Pollard is also
on the bill.
