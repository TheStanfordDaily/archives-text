bringing together and meeting all
those who are interested in any form
or phase of dramatic work, and it will

fessional theatrical "green rooms" or
lounge rooms.
The room contains posters and pic
tures of past productions, as well as
all kinds of current literature relat
ing to the theater, and other objects
of particular interest. A small stage
will be erected for the purposes of ex
perimentation in scenic work, particu

Coach Davis will also hold office
hours in this room, where he will be
glad to meet any one interested in
any form of work.
It is desired to have as many articles
of interest as possible, and for this
season, anyone contributing any post

may be used will be welcomed.
