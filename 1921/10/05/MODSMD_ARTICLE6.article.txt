# First Play of Year to Be Given by Sword and Sandals; Tryouts Friday
## 
### 
Tryouts for the first play of the
year are scheduled to begin at 3:00
o'clock, Friday afternoon. Sword and
Sandals have selected a play with
twenty-nine parts, full of "dramatic
interest," comedy, character parts,
heavys, and opportunities for the
same splendid lighting effects we
heard so much about last year. It
will be the most intellectual produc
tion of the year but with twenty-nine
parts there is no doubt as to its suc
cess.
Coach Davis called attention to a
change in the handling of the pre
liminaries which will be in effect this
year. The old stall about not know
ing that itt was so late has lost its
efficiency and there will be positively
no trying out for the first time on
any other but the first day. The times
set are at 3 to 6, afternoons, and 7
to 10 in the evening.
