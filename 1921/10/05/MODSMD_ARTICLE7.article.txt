# ANESAKI POINTS OUT CHANGES IN ORIENT
## Reveals Problems Caused by Influx of Occidental Ideas and Changes in Industries 
### 
"The social and religious problems
of the Orient today are caused by the
sudden change from the old oriental
mode of living to the activity and in
dustry of the modern occidental civili
zation," said Professor Anesaki in his
lecture on "The Religious and Social
problems of the Orient," which he gave
in the Little Theater, last evening.
Professor Anesaki outlined the chief
differences between the occidental and
oriental nations. He considers that
the Orient represents a mental atti
tude of contemplation while the Occi
dent represents one of activity.
"The modern civilization of the west
is based on industry, science and
democracy," continued Dr. Anesaki.
"There is a spirit of unceasing activi
ty and excitement which was accele
rated by the invention of the steam
engine and capitalistic corporation.
This new system of industry has been
recently introduced into the Orient
and the people, especially the Japan
ese, are quickly adopting it."
Professor Anesaki then explained
the old life of the peoples of India,
China and Japan. They were lazy
and indolent, and the whole system
was based upon castes. The artisans
were merely master and apprentice
and the whole structure of the east
rested upon this. He stated that this
was all changed now because modern
industry compels movement on ac
count of the migration of labor and
capital. This brings about conges
tion in the cities and reacts upon the
whole social and family life of the
countries involved. Speculation was
a new thing in eastern countries until
a very few years ago and now it has
become an important factor.
"The growth of group and class
consciousness is very important," Dr.
Anesaki continued. "The old castes
were no less powerful (when they
were at their height. They were based
upon blood kinship, the worship of
ancestors and traditions and a general
looking backward with piety, rever
ence and duty. The new group con
sciousness is founded in interests
common to a certain class of people
who feel their right to assertion and
freedom. This is a radical swing of
the pendulum."
He sketched the rapid progress of
collective bargaining in Japan. It was
first introduced about ten years ago
with demands for higher wages. Dur
ing this past summer the ship-build
ers of Kobi struck, making a land
mark in the progress of labor unions
in Japan. One of the most import
ant of the labor leaders is a deeply
religious man and slum worker whom
the workingmen call their Savior.
Professor Anesaki said that this in
dustrial life is such a sudden and ex
plosive change that the Koreans who
used to be indolent are now discon
tent to sit down and do nothing, so
they take street cars and aimlessly
ride through the cities.
"There are many religious move
ments in Japan at the present time,"
continued Dr. Anesaki. "Japan is
passing through the critical religious
stage." He outlined this point, divid
ing the rcTigious groups into two sec
tions: that of self-exaltation and
foastfulness and that of self-renuci
ation. The former contains many
superstitious beliefs while the latter
is a close mixture of Buddhism and
Christianity. This latter faith is com
posed mostly of young students who
are also greatly influenced by the
teachings of Tolstoi, the Russian
writer. They desire to reduce human
life to its simplest and purest form.
Professor Anesaki is from the Im
nerial University of Tokio, at which
he holds a chair in Comparative Re
ligion. He has lived for many years
in England and the United States and
speaks with very little accent.

"The social and religious problems
of the Orient today are caused by the
sudden change from the old oriental
mode of living to the activity and in
dustry of the modern occidental civili
zation," said Professor Anesaki in his
lecture on "The Religious and Social
problems of the Orient," which he gave
in the Little Theater, last evening.
Professor Anesaki outlined the chief
differences between the occidental and
oriental nations. He considers that
the Orient represents a mental atti
tude of contemplation while the Occi
dent represents one of activity.
"The modern civilization of the west
is based on industry, science and
democracy," continued Dr. Anesaki.
"There is a spirit of unceasing activi
ty and excitement which was accele
rated by the invention of the steam
engine and capitalistic corporation.
This new system of industry has been
recently introduced into the Orient
and the people, especially the Japan
ese, are quickly adopting it."
Professor Anesaki then explained
the old life of the peoples of India,
China and Japan. They were lazy
and indolent, and the whole system
was based upon castes. The artisans
were merely master and apprentice
and the whole structure of the east
rested upon this. He stated that this
was all changed now because modern
industry compels movement on ac
count of the migration of labor and
capital. This brings about conges
tion in the cities and reacts upon the
whole social and family life of the
countries involved. Speculation was
a new thing in eastern countries until
a very few years ago and now it has
become an important factor.
"The growth of group and class
consciousness is very important," Dr.
Anesaki continued. "The old castes
were no less powerful (when they
were at their height. They were based
upon blood kinship, the worship of
ancestors and traditions and a general
looking backward with piety, rever
ence and duty. The new group con
sciousness is founded in interests
common to a certain class of people
who feel their right to assertion and
freedom. This is a radical swing of
the pendulum."
He sketched the rapid progress of
collective bargaining in Japan. It was
first introduced about ten years ago
with demands for higher wages. Dur
ing this past summer the ship-build
ers of Kobi struck, making a land
mark in the progress of labor unions
in Japan. One of the most import
ant of the labor leaders is a deeply
religious man and slum worker whom
the workingmen call their Savior.
Professor Anesaki said that this in
dustrial life is such a sudden and ex
plosive change that the Koreans who
used to be indolent are now discon
tent to sit down and do nothing, so
they take street cars and aimlessly
ride through the cities.
"There are many religious move
ments in Japan at the present time,"
continued Dr. Anesaki. "Japan is
passing through the critical religious
stage." He outlined this point, divid
ing the rcTigious groups into two sec
tions: that of self-exaltation and
foastfulness and that of self-renuci
ation. The former contains many
superstitious beliefs while the latter
is a close mixture of Buddhism and
Christianity. This latter faith is com
posed mostly of young students who
are also greatly influenced by the
teachings of Tolstoi, the Russian
writer. They desire to reduce human
life to its simplest and purest form.
Professor Anesaki is from the Im
nerial University of Tokio, at which
he holds a chair in Comparative Re
ligion. He has lived for many years
in England and the United States and
