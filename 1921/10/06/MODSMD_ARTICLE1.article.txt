# FRESHMEN GIVE VARSITY THRILL BUT CAN'T SCORE
## Van Gent Names Thirty Men to Compose Varsity Squad as St. Mary's Game Nears 
### 
Duffy Seay and his 1925, footballers
threw a real scare into the Varsity
ranks last night, when the two teams
underwent an hour of hard scrim
mage.
The fun came after most of the fans
had left the bleachers. It was rapidly
getting dark when the freshman team
got possession of the ball 011 their
own forty-yard line.
Plowing through the varsity line for
gains averaging about three yards a
buck, the freshman backfield men
steadily advanced the ball down the
field to the Varsity's five-yard mark
where they made it first and ten.
It was here that the Van Gent de
fense steadied and took the ball on
downs but not before the ball was on
their two-foot line. It was a pretty
offensive that the 1925 aggregation
had under way.
During the first part of the fresh
man-varsity melee Van Gent's men
were able to shove over a couple of
touchdowns. Both teams were going
good. Cuddeback at full for the
babes showed he possessed a wicked
boot as liis spirals were averaging
better than fifty-five yards.
"Red" Kelly, Wisconsin end in 1914,
'IG, and '18, was on the field coaching
the Stanford wing men last night.
"Dink" Templeton is laid up with ill
ness and will probably not be back for
the rest of the week.
Coach Van Gent last night split his
squad into two varsities, naming
thirty men to compose the first string
outfit. They are: Captain Patrick, De
Groot, Ludeke, Flood, Betts, Stice,
Schlessinger, Dickey, Fullerton, Car
ter, Douglas, Helser, Campbell, Taylor,
Mertz, Pershing, Larson, Sproull,
Farish, Loomis, Hartranft, Wilcox,
Schlaudeman, Woodward, Doughty,
Hey, Reed, Cleveland, and Phelps.
The remainder of the squad will be
known as the second varsity.
It is not known just how Van Gent
will start his men against the St.
Mary's varsity, Saturday. Many on
the field (last night expressed the
opinion that the Card head coach
would probably line his men up just
as he started them against the fresh
men last night.
This line-up would bring into play
the following men: Larson and Persh
ing, ends; Carter and Helser, tackles;
Douglas and Ludeke, guards; DeGroot,
center; Woodward, quarter; Wilcox
and Shlaudeman, half, and Patrick,
full.

The remainder of the squad will be
known as the second varsity.
It is not known just how Van Gent
will start his men against the St.
Mary's varsity, Saturday. Many on
the field (last night expressed the
opinion that the Card head coach
would probably line his men up just
as he started them against the fresh
men last night.
This line-up would bring into play
the following men: Larson and Persh
ing, ends; Carter and Helser, tackles;
Douglas and Ludeke, guards; DeGroot,
center; Woodward, quarter; Wilcox
and Shlaudeman, half, and Patrick,
full.
