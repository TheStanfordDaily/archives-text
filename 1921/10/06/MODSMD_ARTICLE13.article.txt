# YANKS AGAIN BEAT McGRAW'S GIANTS IN PITCHER'S DUEL
## Waite Hoyt, Boy Heaver for Miller Huggins, Blanks Opposition and Grants Nationals Only Two Hits 
### United Press Wire 
POLO GROUNDS, NEW YORK, Oct. 6.—Pitched into a
state of helplessness, the New York Giants were blanked for
the second time and pushed farther away from the baseball
crown, when they went down before the Yanks here this
afternoon, 3 to 0.
Close to 40,000 saw the victor and the vanquished go
through a fierce game in which the battling Yanks repeated
their victory in the first game of the series yesterday.
Waite Hoyt, the Yanks' boy pitcher from Brooklyn,
pitched every ounce of drive out of the Giants bludgeons.
He held the hard hitting National League champions to two
scattered hits, one of which was a little scratch that dropped
between the great Ruth and Peck.
The Giants again played heartless ball and showed
symptoms of being whipped from the first inning. Their
heads were down and all of the dash and the spirit that

marked their drive for the pennant in
its National League race seemed to
have evaporated,
The score, by innings.
