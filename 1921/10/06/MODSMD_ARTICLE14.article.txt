# MERMEN MEET TO MAKE SCHEDULE FOR FALL SWIMS
## 
### 
Varsity men in large numbers turned
out this afternoon at the first meet
ing of the swimmers, at Encina Pool.
Practically all of the old men are
back and in addition Harry Austin,
who has been away for a year, is back
and will make a strong addition to
the ranks of the Cardinal mermen.
George Drake and Arthur Austin
are both out for the sprints again and
are going in great shape. Austin who
was hindered a good deal of the time
by sickness last season is now in
much better shape and will be one of
the standbys in the half-century.
The babes have a good looking line
up at the pool. Some of the best
swimmers from the schools of San
Francisco have registereed in the
University and will form a nucleus
around which Coach Brandsten may
build up a formidable machine. The
fact that many of the Universities
throughout the country have made
swimming a sport of the major class
is giving more impetus to participa
tion in it and is getting a satisfactory
response from men who can put on a
good exhibition in the line of aqua
tics.
The water polo teams this year will
be better than last season. There is
now a whole year of experience, with
the team in playing togethed, and tlicy
work like a veteran organization.
Brandsten is highly optimistic for a
first class season in his sport.
