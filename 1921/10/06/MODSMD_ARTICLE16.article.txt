# APROPOS OF BIG GAME
## 
### 
This is the season for Big Game. Several universities up and down
the coast are already gunning for the Big Game through the medium of
the press. They are trying to convince the general public that their
game with the University of California eleven, which last year was the
strongest eleven on the Pacific Slope, will be the one and only Big Game
of the year, This will continue until November 19, when Stanford and
California get together to dedicate the new Stanford bowl. Then, and
then only, will T1 IB BIG GAME be played, and the memory of all other
big games played before that time will pale into significance in the light
of that great struggle.
Down Los Angeles way the University of Southern California is
putting forth a campaign to have the game with the University of Cali
fornia scheduled for Berkeley on November 5 recognized as the Big
Game of the coast. By flaunting their last year's record on the gridiron
before the public gaze they hope to bamboozle someone into thinking
they will play the Big Game this season. Their record was good enough
last season. But this is another season, and the public looks forward
and not backward. Stanford has another team. Stanford has a new
coaching staff. Also Stanford has a new stadium, and that is where the
Big Game of Pacific Coast football will be played this season.
If Stanford had noi coaches at all and the game were to be played
on the old turf field, so long as there were eleven men and one football
there would be a struggle with the team from Berkeley across the bay,
and that would be the Big Game.
Whenever these two perennial rivals get together, even though one
institution boasts of a team far superior to the other and there isn't even
a question of who will win, the alumni, faculty and students clamor for
tickets to the contest and the dear old public battles to rid itself of a few
dollars to see the teams in action.
During the years when Stanford and California were estranged,
when California played American football with the University of Wash
ington, and Stanford played rugby with Santa Clara as its chief op
ponent, there were no big games. True these contests were called Big
Games, but there was something lacking. The old enthusiasm and par
tisan feeling was missing. Just like' two kids who cooperated in produc
ing a circus and then split up to produce their own shows. Each had its
own following but the general public and the old grads refuse to be
buncoed into thinking that either had the greatest show on earth.
When Stanford and California got together again in 1919, the an
nual Big Game once more became an event on the sporting calendar.
And thus it will always be. Although each eleven may play some mighty
fast teams during its preliminary season the Big Game of the Pacific
Coast occurs but once a year, and that is when Stanford plays the Uni
versity of California. ,
