# SENIORS INSTEAD OF JUNIORS WILL HAVE PICTURES IN QUAD
## 
### 
Members of the junior class adopted
unanimously today a plan suggested by
Quad Editor Wylie Kilpatrick, '23, that
the junior photographic section should
be replaced by a senior photographic
section. The usual record section will
be used as in former years.
The class agreed to the unique idea,
with the reservations that both the class
of '22 and the class of '24 should con
cur in such arrangements.
Kilpatrick outlined his scheme to the
class members on the assumption that
many might disagree with the details
of his plan, especially since it will mean
that the juniors are giving way to the
seniors, and that the seniors will have
the privilege of seeing themselves in
the annual book for the second year.
He received a welcome reception,
however, and no dissenting voices were
heard. Three other speakers from the
floor urged adoption of the radical up
per-class change in the publication.
In lieu of the junior section the edi
tors of the Quad will have issued a spe
cial junior edition, each copy to bear
the engraved'name of the particular jun
ior purchasing that copy. None of this
issue will be sold or given to any other
than the members of the '23 class.
Agreement of the classes of '22 and '24
with the tentative arrangements of the
juniors will automatically guarantee
continuance of the precedent being es
tablished. In years to come it is ex
pected the rule of "seniority" will be
observed. The plan is in accordance, it
was said by Kilpatrick later, with the
systems in vogue in many eastern uni
versities.
