# SOCCER ELEVEN AND ITALIA VIRTUS MEET
## Large Turnout of Old Men Insures Fast Turn with City Team; Game is Saturday 
### 
Stanford's socceer eleven will tangle
in the first fracas of the season on
Saturday afternoon with the Italia
Virtus Club of San Francisco, on the
local turf. Coach Maloney has the
largest gang out on the field at the
present time that has been seen for a
long time and with a large majority
of the old men back in the game,
everything points to a successful sea
son for the Stanford exponents of the
English sport.
This summer an excellent freshman
team was developed among the many
entrants for the summer quarter and
most of these men have come back
out now that the quarter is on. The
total number turning out nightly for
the game is between eighty-five and
one hundred. The enthusiasm shown
by all hands is in keeping with the
general optimistic feeling that per
vades that athletic outlook for the
year and augers for a mighty good
schedule that will keep up mighty
keen competition for berths 011 the
eleven. The team that played here
during the summer quarter held the
veteran Olympic down to a 3 to 1
score and gave them the battle of the
year to make the three tallies that
were garnered.
Negotiations are now on to arrange
a game on the day of the "big battle."
so that the fans who are on the cam
pus in the morning before the battle
royal may have something exciting
to while away their time with. Cali
fornia is grooming a team again this
year that will give the locals the same
tough fights that they had to put up
last year and if the scrap material
izes there will be something worth
going to see on the morning of Novem
ber 19.
Captain Bill Gorman is working with
the team all the time now and promis
es to have them in. good shape before
the first game Saturday. The old
men are in their own positions for
the most part and so the machine will
work smoothly from the start and
early season will be the only hindr
ance. The large number of men will
allow the full allowance of substitu
tions though and probably some of
the new men will be tried out in the
various positions.
Among the old guard who are back
on the team are: Captain Gorman,
Anderson, Elmore, Mathews, Mendoza,
Silvierra, Robertson, Titus, Peavy,
Clark, Bucklin, Taylor, and Walther.
