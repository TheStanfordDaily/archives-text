# SEAY TRAINING BABES FOR TWO HARD BATTLES
## Cardinal First-Year Outfit Displays Class in Turmoil With Heavy Varsity Squad 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay sent his freshmen
proteges against the Cardinal varsity
yesterday in a scrimmage that lasted
for nearly an hour. Several changes in
the lineup were made throughout the
practice, the freshmen coaches experi
menting with both the backfield and the
line. Playing against a heavier line,
the freshmen showed to a good advan
tage, although teamwork was lacking to
some extent. One notable feature of
the scrimmage was the tackling of the'
first-year men, which' showed a great
improvement over their past work.
Cuddeback, who has been Seay's choice
for the fullback position so far, played a
good game yesterday. He made several
gains through the line and proved to
have good ability as a plunger. Cudde
back has also been doing the bulk of
the kicking for the freshmen with jans
sen, Fuller and Dennis helping out now
and then.
Two brothers of men on Coach Van
Gent's varsity squad, Helser and Fuller,
are showing up well in the freshman
lineup. Helser is giving the first string
tackles a light for their places while Ful
ler has been trying out for an end po
sition. In the scrimmage with the var
sity yesterday, Fuller made himself
prominent on several occasions by break
ing into the offense and breaking up
plays. Martin and McCory are others
011 the reserves who are forcing the
regulars to play their best all the time.
Saturday morning the freshmen bat
tle the fast Berkeley High crowd, and
from all reports the trans-bay team
should give the Babes a close game. The
