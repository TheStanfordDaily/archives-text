# WELCOME GIVEN TO FRESHMEN IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## New Students Hear Talks on Stanford Ideals; Freshman Meeting Sunday Announced 
### 
"Be a square man, square with the
world. You're away from pa and ma,
and if you are checked up it will be by
your associates." Such was the gist of
President Wilbur's address to the new
students, given at the Assembly of wel
come this morning, at which Dr. Gard
ner, Dean Culver and Dean Yost also
spoke.
Dr. Wilbur, in speaking to the new
students of the part they must play, of
fered a few pertinent observations on
what the conduct of a true Stanford
man must be. "There are two stand
ards by which you will be measured,"
he said. "First, the record in the reg
istrar's office, and second, the opinion of
your fellows as to your personal quali
ties,. loyalty, decency, ability in team
and in cooperative enterprises.
"Always be yourself, not a five or ten
cent-store imitation of some mythical
conception known as the college man.
"Acquire regularity in ydur habits of
study and in your conduct in general.
The student who never cuts classes, who
pays attention and who studies some
each day rarely leaves us at our behest."
Speaking of the combination of al
cohol and autos, Dr. Wilbur declared
that he had "never seen an auto help
to carry the ball across the U. C. goal
line, or alcohol, applied internally to our
own side, help to win an athletic con
test for Stanford," and stated that it
took "two quarters for one auto and a
few extra dollars to transfer a freshman
from Stanford to other fields of en
deavor."
In this connection he said that "we
have a David and Goliath stunt to do
this fall, and when it is over the 'won
der team' will wonder how it happened."
Dr. Wilbur also spoke forcefully in
behalf of the honor system, reminding
the new students that if they did not
care to accept it entirely in deed and
spirit, "the sooner they turn their back
on Stanford the better."
The question of the University's in
creased registration was taken up. Dr.
Wilbur declared that the growth has
been where Stanford can best stand it—
in the upper classes —but the housing
facilities are becoming more acute than
ever. However, he stated that Comp
troller Roth and lie were working stead
ily toward a solution, and the situation
should be cleared up in a few months.
Working plans for the eating pavilion
back of Encina have been completed.
Dr. Wilbur introduced the new dean
of women, Dean Mary Yost. Dean Yost
welcomed the new women to Stanford,
and spoke on the many advantages the
University had to offer to those who
took occasion to grasp them. She spoke
of the University as being built with
a certain unified idea: "It is no ordinary
village of two or three thousand; you
can see at once it is planned for a spe
cial purpose."
Dean Culver was the next to speak,
and in opening his talk he told of the
confused freshman who walked into his
office and inquired if "the Bean was
dizzy"; which, he remarked, called to
mind that there had been a good many
"dizzy beans" around the campus during
the strenuous rush of matriculation
week.
The distinction between simply being
a man of Stanford and a Stanford man
was pointed out by Dean Culver. "The
mere act of registration makes you a
man of Stanford," lie said, "but it takes
more than that to make you a Stanford
man." Among the things he listed as
being necessary to a real Stanford man
were honesty—"the kind of honesty that
makes a man good company to himself"
—modesty, the spirit of cooperation, and
the determination to work well and play
well.
Dr. Gardner also spoke on the spirit
of life of Stanford, lirst making the an
nouncement of the traditional gathering
of the freshman class on the inner quad
rangle to take place this coining Sunday.
The class will meet at 10:45, and march
into the Memorial Church for the short
services of welcome.
"How many of you have fallen in
love—with Stanford?" was one of the
questions asked by Dr. Gardner, for, he
declared, "if you do not love your col
lege, she can never hope to inspire you."
He spoke of the beauty of the Stanford
campus. "1 know of nothing quite so
beautiful as the Stanford quadrangle,"
even considering the many universities
which he has seen in his travels through
the United States and Europe.
A bit of good advice was offered to
the newcomers when Dr. Gardner de
clared most emphatically that "there is
no place here for snobbery." And in
closing, he exhorted the students to "do
your work and live your life so that you
may add to the glory of Stanford; for
the glory of Stanford is our pride."
