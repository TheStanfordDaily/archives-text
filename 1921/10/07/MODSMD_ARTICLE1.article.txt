# GIANTS SLAUGHTER YANKEES IN HEAVY HITTING GAME, 13-5
## McGraw's Outfit Comes to Life at Last; Hammers Four of Huggins' Pitchers, Making Series 2 to 1 
### United Press Wire 
POLO FIELD, NEW YORK, Oct. 7.—Coming to life after
a forty-eight hour trance, the Giants of John McGraw, rose
and battered the cocky Yankees almost to a pulp in the third
game of the world series, this afternoon.
Awakening with murder in their eyes the league champs
flew at four Yankee pitchers and won in a walk by a score
of 13 to 5.
It took a four-run rally in the third inning, when the
American League winners scored four runs, to bring the
Giants out of the trance under which McGraw's men lost
the first two games of the series, without a single run.
Jess Barnes, the frail right-hander, who has been rushed
to the rescue just a few minutes before, when the ponder
ous Fred Toney had been knocked out of the box, started
the festivities which brought to death the previously para
lyzed foe in the Giant bat bag.
Barnes singled to right and Bancroft followed with another
safe rap. Bob Shawkey blew to the sacks then and lost
