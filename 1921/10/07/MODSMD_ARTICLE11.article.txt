# BIGGEST BAND IN HISTORY TO PLAY FOR SAINTS GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's biggest band bows before
bellowing bleachers for the first time
tomorrow. Sixty pieces, approximately,
will furnish music for the singing stands
at the St. Mary's contest. Almost all of
the old musicians are back and there is
much new material which has boosted
the quality of the performances as well
as the personnel.
At last night's meeting new officers
were elected. C. V. Smith, '22, will be
the student leader this year. C. C.
Burgher, '22. was elected manager, and
W. F. Schall, '18, librarian. The new
assistant librarian is Joe Schieb, '22.
Plans for several trips were made at the
meeting. Pacific Grove will be visited
again this year and one or two others
were suggested. The Frosh game at
Berkeley is included.
The moving of the band stand from
its old site near the Union to the lake
is expected to give the activity a big
stimulus.
