# CARDS READY FOR HARD BAM WITH ST. MARY'S
## VARSITY'S STRENGTH TO BE TESTED IN CONTEST WITH FAST TRANS-BAY ELEVEN 
### 
STANFORD'S VARSITY holds itself in readiness tonight for the first im
portant grid game of the season on the Card field with St. Mary's tomor
row afternoon.
Coach Gene Van Gent sent his men through their last hard practice of
the week, last night, and was today winding up with a light workout. Mem
bers of the varsity squad are in good shape for the St. Mary's fray.
The Cardinal head coach has issued a statementt in which he says his
team is ready to put up a better game than they did last Saturday, and that
he belie#es they must do so to beat St. Mary's tomorrow.
No official line-up was issued as to who would start the fray, but Van
Gent announced a tentative list consisting of Pershing and Mertz, ends;
Helser and Carter, tackles; Ludeke and Douglas, guards; DeGroot. center;
Woodward, quarter; Wilcox and Shlaudeman, halfs; and Captain Patrick, full.
Most of the members of the varsity squad will appear on the field to-

morrow with new leather affairs on
the front of their jersies deigned to
aid the player in holding the ball.
Director of Athletic,? Walter Powell
was the designer ot" the plan.
The Stanford mentors sent the var
sity up against the second-stringers
last night for more than half an hour.
The varsity used a forward pass of-

fensive during the greater part of the
scrimmage and completed most of
them.
Van Gent used "Shorty" Mertz, Dick
Pershing, "Swede" Larson, Glen
Hartranft, and "Kewp" Sproull on the
ends and all of them garnered long
passes for good gain?.
Cliff Hey, captain of the 1924 eleven,
looked good In last night's workout,
plunging through several times for
substantial jardage.
"Dink" Temrleton, who is in charge
of the second varsity and coaches the
kickers, appeared on the field all
wrapped up in a heavy overcoat and
talking in whispers. He is juet out
cl the hospital after a throat opera
t'.cn.
Tomorrow's conflict with St.
Mary's team should give followers of
the grid game a line on how the Stan
ford varsity compares with California.
St. Mary's held the Bruins to a 21-0
count, two weeks ago.
Coach Van Gent expects a hard
battle and will probably use what he
considers his strongest combination
some time during the game.
Reports from St. Mary's today were
to the effect that the entire student
body from the institution would mi
grate here tomorrow.
The Catholics depend greatly on
Stockton to pierce the big Cardinal
line. He was out of the California
fracas but is considered Coach Madi
gan's best bet in the backfield. D'fck,
Silva and Kuahane, the little half
back, completed a fast and powerful
offensive combination for the St.
Mary's leader.
It is believed that tomorrow's con
test will consist largely of open work
as St. Mary's is known to favor that
method of game with their fast backs
and there are many here who figure
that Van Gent is not drilling his men
night after night at passing for no
thing.
The varsity tangle Will immediately
follow the freshman game, which is
set for 1:15. Student body cards will
admit to both contests.

the grid game a line on how the Stan
ford varsity compares with California.
St. Mary's held the Bruins to a 21-0
count, two weeks ago.
Coach Van Gent expects a hard
battle and will probably use what he
considers his strongest combination
some time during the game.
Reports from St. Mary's today were
to the effect that the entire student
body from the institution would mi
grate here tomorrow.
The Catholics depend greatly on
Stockton to pierce the big Cardinal
line. He was out of the California
fracas but is considered Coach Madi
gan's best bet in the backfield. D'fck,
Silva and Kuahane, the little half
back, completed a fast and powerful
offensive combination for the St.
Mary's leader.
It is believed that tomorrow's con
test will consist largely of open work
as St. Mary's is known to favor that
method of game with their fast backs
and there are many here who figure
that Van Gent is not drilling his men
night after night at passing for no
thing.
The varsity tangle Will immediately
follow the freshman game, which is
set for 1:15. Student body cards will
admit to both contests.
STANFORD'S VARSITY holds itself in readiness tonight for the first im
portant grid game of the season on the Card field with St. Mary's tomor
row afternoon.
Coach Gene Van Gent sent his men through their last hard practice of
the week, last night, and was today winding up with a light workout. Mem
bers of the varsity squad are in good shape for the St. Mary's fray.
The Cardinal head coach has issued a statementt in which he says his
team is ready to put up a better game than they did last Saturday, and that
he belie#es they must do so to beat St. Mary's tomorrow.
No official line-up was issued as to who would start the fray, but Van
Gent announced a tentative list consisting of Pershing and Mertz, ends;
Helser and Carter, tackles; Ludeke and Douglas, guards; DeGroot. center;
Woodward, quarter; Wilcox and Shlaudeman, halfs; and Captain Patrick, full.
Most of the members of the varsity squad will appear on the field to-

morrow with new leather affairs on
the front of their jersies deigned to
aid the player in holding the ball.
Director of Athletic,? Walter Powell
was the designer ot" the plan.
The Stanford mentors sent the var
sity up against the second-stringers
last night for more than half an hour.
The varsity used a forward pass of-

fensive during the greater part of the
scrimmage and completed most of
them.
Van Gent used "Shorty" Mertz, Dick
Pershing, "Swede" Larson, Glen
Hartranft, and "Kewp" Sproull on the
ends and all of them garnered long
passes for good gain?.
Cliff Hey, captain of the 1924 eleven,
looked good In last night's workout,
plunging through several times for
substantial jardage.
"Dink" Temrleton, who is in charge
of the second varsity and coaches the
kickers, appeared on the field all
wrapped up in a heavy overcoat and
talking in whispers. He is juet out
cl the hospital after a throat opera
t'.cn.
Tomorrow's conflict with St.
Mary's team should give followers of
the grid game a line on how the Stan
ford varsity compares with California.
