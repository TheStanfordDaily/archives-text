# YELL LEADERS
## 
### 
It has been said many times that the rooting sections are one-half
of the Big Game. The importance of the position of Yell Leader may be
realized when we recall the rooting sections of Big Games of the past.
The Big Game is primarily an athletic spectacle. The athletic part of the
program is furnished by two husky football elevens, brought to the
height of efficiency by athletic coaches. The spectacle is furnished as
much by the bleacher sections themselves as by the teams in action. The
efficiency of the bleacher performances is produced by the Yell Leader,
who is virtually the coach of the rooters in the rooting section. That is
from the spectator's standpoint.
To the undergraduate there is a still more important angle. That
is, the effect the rooting section has upon the team fighting for honors
for the University on the field below. The fellow who can incite the
crowd in the bleachers to such a high pitch of vocal efficiency that the
team can hear it above all the other noises, and is made to realize that
the student body is behind it and is spurring it on to greater efforts, must
work just as hard as the man who carries the ball down the field for the
fmst touchdown.
There is one time when the Stanford student body is united in
spirit. That is during the progress of the Big Game. More than two
thousand men and women have but one thought and purpose uppermost
in their minds, the winning of the game.- Their enthusiasms and emotions
are given expression vocally. In this they are organized and guided by
the Yell Leader and his two helpers.
An opportunity is presented to the men of the class of 1923 to com
pete for two of the most coveted positions in the student body. Recently
a call was issued for tryoutees from the Junior Class for the positions of
assistant yell leaders. Due perhaps to the hurry and bustle of register
ing and getting settled in the routine the men of the Junior Class failed
to see the notice which was published, or, seeing it, failed to give any
thought to it. The response to date has been very light.
The two assistants chosen this year will be particularly fortunate.
They will have the privilege of assisting the Yell Leader in the game with
the University of California team that will dedicate the new Stanford
bowl. Stunts arranged by the Yell Leader and his assistants, and executed
by them and the rooting section, will be witnessed by more than 59,000
>eople and admired by them.
The Big Game is but one event at which the Yell Leader and his
ssociates officiate. Assemblies, rallies, and all other athletic events are
omplete only with the work of these three men. It is an activity that
alls for plenty of gray matter and ability in handling a mass of
people in addition to a pair of lusty lungs and ability to wave the arms
rhythmically.
The opportunity of being a builder in the 1921 Big Game spectacle
alone should be sufficient incentive to cause fifty men to report to Yell
Leader Connolly tomorrow afternoon for a tryout.
It is well for students to bear in mind in this connection that in
electing these two associates they are choosing men who will work
throughout the year, and one of them will be the Yell Leader next year.
Efficiency should be the lone standard by which the candidates are judged.
Popularity and politics should be disregarded entirely in the selection.

team can hear it above all the other noises, and is made to realize that
the student body is behind it and is spurring it on to greater efforts, must
work just as hard as the man who carries the ball down the field for the
fmst touchdown.
There is one time when the Stanford student body is united in
spirit. That is during the progress of the Big Game. More than two
thousand men and women have but one thought and purpose uppermost
in their minds, the winning of the game.- Their enthusiasms and emotions
are given expression vocally. In this they are organized and guided by
the Yell Leader and his two helpers.
An opportunity is presented to the men of the class of 1923 to com
pete for two of the most coveted positions in the student body. Recently
a call was issued for tryoutees from the Junior Class for the positions of
assistant yell leaders. Due perhaps to the hurry and bustle of register
ing and getting settled in the routine the men of the Junior Class failed
to see the notice which was published, or, seeing it, failed to give any
thought to it. The response to date has been very light.
The two assistants chosen this year will be particularly fortunate.
They will have the privilege of assisting the Yell Leader in the game with
the University of California team that will dedicate the new Stanford
bowl. Stunts arranged by the Yell Leader and his assistants, and executed
by them and the rooting section, will be witnessed by more than 59,000
>eople and admired by them.
The Big Game is but one event at which the Yell Leader and his
ssociates officiate. Assemblies, rallies, and all other athletic events are
omplete only with the work of these three men. It is an activity that
alls for plenty of gray matter and ability in handling a mass of
people in addition to a pair of lusty lungs and ability to wave the arms
rhythmically.
The opportunity of being a builder in the 1921 Big Game spectacle
alone should be sufficient incentive to cause fifty men to report to Yell
Leader Connolly tomorrow afternoon for a tryout.
It is well for students to bear in mind in this connection that in
electing these two associates they are choosing men who will work
throughout the year, and one of them will be the Yell Leader next year.
Efficiency should be the lone standard by which the candidates are judged.
Popularity and politics should be disregarded entirely in the selection.
It has been said many times that the rooting sections are one-half
of the Big Game. The importance of the position of Yell Leader may be
realized when we recall the rooting sections of Big Games of the past.
The Big Game is primarily an athletic spectacle. The athletic part of the
program is furnished by two husky football elevens, brought to the
height of efficiency by athletic coaches. The spectacle is furnished as
much by the bleacher sections themselves as by the teams in action. The
efficiency of the bleacher performances is produced by the Yell Leader,
who is virtually the coach of the rooters in the rooting section. That is
from the spectator's standpoint.
To the undergraduate there is a still more important angle. That
is, the effect the rooting section has upon the team fighting for honors
for the University on the field below. The fellow who can incite the
crowd in the bleachers to such a high pitch of vocal efficiency that the
team can hear it above all the other noises, and is made to realize that
the student body is behind it and is spurring it on to greater efforts, must
work just as hard as the man who carries the ball down the field for the
