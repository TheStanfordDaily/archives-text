# 'MAKE UP' CLASS TO RENEW INTEREST IN PHYSICAL TRAINING
## 
### 
Walter Powell, Director of Athletics,
announced the adoption of a new plan
to bring pressure to bear upon those
students who fail to satisfactorily ful
fill athletic requirements during their
first six quarters in the University.
A disciplinary class will be organ
ized with the title of the "make-up"
class and students transferred to this
group will be compelled to do their
three hours per week at hard drill.
Students registering in gym classes
to fulfill requirements have always
been allowed to register in any sport
they preferred. This custom will be
continued until a student is found to
be slul'fing off on the job and then he
will be shifted to the "make-up" class
and the heavy gang labor will be his
lot until he shows signs of renewed
interest.
Director Powell feels that the Stan
ford system of conducting athletic
training is one of the most agreeable
and efficient in the country, it is,
therefore, his intention to see that all
students live up to its requirements
and derive all the benefit possible
from it.
