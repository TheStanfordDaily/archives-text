# DR. WILLIAMS IS SATISFIED WITH BOWL'S PROGRESS
## President of Athletic Board Expresses Spirit of Entire Cooperation With Berkeley 
### 
As the stadium nears completion,
more and more expressions of satisfac
tion on the part of the University folk
and admiration from outsiders are being
uttered. The Palo Alto Times recently
received this interview from Dr. Wil
liams of the Board of Athletic Control,
explaining the Board's policy and the
relation of our stadium project to Cali
fornia's War Memorial.
Dr. Thomas M. Williams, president
of the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol, came away from an inspection of
the new Stanford stadium today wear
ing a smile as broad as ever was seen
on his face when years ago he played
center on victorious Stanford varsities.
Dr. Williams is admittedly proud of the
achievement of the Board of Athletic
Control which, through the cooperation
of the Stanford student body, the
alumni, and the general public, has been
able to accomplish the seemingly im
possible and completed a fully equipped
football stadium with 60,0(X) seats in
time for the game with the University
of California on November 19.
"I am growing to love it more every
day," he said as he took a last look at
the great structure. When the 19th of
November comes everything will be as
complete as human hands and brains
can make it. That will be a great day
for Stanford push and determination,
when .60,000 people file into our stadium
for the first time and see what lias been
done in less than six months in an en
tirely new type of stadium design and
construction.
"We are glad to see that California is
going ahead with her proposed stadium.
It is gratifying to us to see that she is
able to capitalize our stadium and make
use of it in financing her own.
"It is the aim of our Board of Ath
letic Control to cooperate in every way
in boosting the California stadium. It
has taken some vision, courage, and push
to put through our stadium financing
and building in less than a year, but the
results accomplished are worth the ex
tra cost in cash. As a result of the effi
ciency with which our work has been
yushed we are going to make use of our
stadium in November.
"The income from this one game in
the new stadium over and above what
the. income would have been from the
game on our field had we been forced
to use it this fall, will make Stanford
efficiency among the greatest, if not the
greatest, contributor to the California
War Memorial.
"Speeding up on our part will make
California's part of the gate rccepits this
fall equal to more than half the total
cost of our stadium.
"This is cooperating to the limit, but
we arc glad that we are in a position to
do it.
"Yes, I also have heard that our
friends across the bay are expressing
some fears and regrets that the Stanford
stadium is to be only a temporary af
fair. That, I think, is an unnecessary
worry on their part. Before building
we have thoroughly investigated the
durability of the materials used in the
construction. With the exception of our
wooden seats, which arc easily replaced
at intervals, and some concrete curbing
around the track, our structure is com
posed of water worn stones, sand and
gravel. In other words tlie embank
ment forming our bowl has about the
same composition as that of a terminal
moraine left by prehistoric glaciers.
"Just how long such a structure will
last no one can say, but we have it on
no less authority than the late Profes
sor Joseph LcConte. of the University
of California, that these moraines have
stood and held their shape fairly well
for from ten to twenty thousand years.
Figuring on the minimum duration, we
are perfectly safe in saying that we have
a stadium good for the next ten tliou
! sand years. Before the end of that pe
riod we hope to be in a financial position
to erect a permanent structure."
