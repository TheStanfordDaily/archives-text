# SEQUOIA SMOKER IS COMPLETE SUCCESS
## 
### 
Sequoia Hall held the first smoker of
the year in the club rooms last night at
7:30 o'clock with a program that was
both entertaining and full of life.
Cal Sapero and Fred Penwell boxed
for two rounds to a draw, failing to
satisfy the fans' demand for blood. Don
Robertson entertained with two violin
selections, accompanied by Ed Butler,
piano, and Earl May, saxaphone. Abe
Brazil and Max Koehler wrestled for
four minutes but neither secured a fall
in the allotted time. Phil Landis and
Chet Hess each had a laugh in store for
the smokers, Landis with a poem and
Hess with bits of gossip that he had
picked up. The serious side of the pro
gram was presented by Art Tyler, who
enlivened an otherwise dry subject with
bits of clever wit. He explained the
house rules in a way that left the lis-,
toners calling for more.
The social committee made the hit of
the evening with their smokes, choco
late, doughnuts and bananas.
Preceding the smoker a business
meeting was held at which it was de
cided that the old Roble tennis courts
would be taken over by the club and im
proved for the use of its members. A
committee was appointed to draw up
plans for the Sequoia Wake, to lie held
a few nights before the big game.
Ray Law was appointed Club His
torian and Charles Prior Press Repre
sentative. Ted Shephard was elected
Junior Representative on the House
Committee and Spaulding to the Finance
Committee.
