# NEW STUDENTS MEET TOMORROW TO TAKE INTELLIGENCE TEST
## 
### 
For the first time since its incorpora
tion into the entrance requirements last
spring, the general intelligence test will
be put into operation when all new un
dergraduates, including the 480 odd
freshmen, meet in the Assembly Hall
tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock.
The intelligence test, under the plan
adopted by the faculty, will have no di
rect effect upon a student's entrance
into the University. The results are
not to be made public and are for the
information of the faculty only.
The test, which was prepared for the
most part by Professor Lewis M. Ter
man, is in the hands of the Department
of Education. "Intelligence tests may
be thought of simply as a more or less
imperfect method of arriving at a pre
diction of an individual's probable suc
cess in certain kinds of intellectual
work," says Professor Terman.
Their practical value to the Univer
sity will lie in their use as a source of
supplementary information in cases
where there is a close decision. They
will also be employed in the study of
failures, in the comparison of social
groups, in the vocational guidance of
students, and in the selection of promis
ing students for scholarships.
It is planned by the University to ob
tain eventually, by means of intelligence
tests, the best-fitted students for the
University. The results of the test and
the conclusions reached are to be care
fully noted in the attempt to formulate
the most reliable test possible.
The intelligence test is fast becoming
standardized a$ part of the entrance re
quirements of the leading institutions of
the country, Columbia and the Univer
sity of California being among those
that have already adopted it.
