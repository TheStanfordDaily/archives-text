# STANFORD TO HAVE ITS BAND STAND ON SHORES OF LAGUNITA
## 
### 
Stanford will have a band stand on
the shores of Lagunita, the lake on the
college campus which contains water for
only a part of the year. One of the
University projects for the future is to
make this lake a year-round institution
through impounding a greater supply of
water in the foothills so that the lake
can be supplied throughout the dry sea
son. Even when the lake is dry as it
is at present, however, the location of
the band stand will be favorable since
it will stand in a group of willow trees,
and those who attend the concerts which
are frequently given by the University
band, may seat themselves either under
the shade of a double row of pine trees
stretching along the lake shore between
the women's boathouse and the men's
boathouse, or over the gentle slopes of
a hill which can be made to form a
natural amphitheater.
For evening performances, other than
band concerts, seats may be arranged in
the open space just in front of the band
stand, which has sufficient slope to give
all the spectators a clear view of the
stage.
The band stand originally stood on the
plot of grouild on which the new Union
building is nearing completion. Its new
permanent site has been selected after
a survey of the whole campus and an
invitation extended to the entire com
munity to offer suggestions as to the
best location.
