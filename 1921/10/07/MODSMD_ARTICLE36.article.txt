# LAW SCHOOL CHANGES ARE ANNOUNCED BY DEAN C. A. HUSTON
## 
### 
Two changes in the curriculum of the
Law School have been decided upon and
are to take effect at once, it was an
nounced by Dean C. A. Huston. The
granting of the LL. B. degree is now
discontinued, and the course in Intro
duction to Law, formerly required of all
first-year law students, will no longer
be given.
"The abolition of the LL. B. is in line
with the movement for more cultural
preparation," said Dean Huston yester
day, "and the University of California
Law School has already done away with
that degree. There has been little de
mand for the five-year course in recent
years."
The dropping of the introductory
course in law was attributed in part by
Dean Huston to the establishment of
the course in Citizenship and to the re
quiremcnis of the Lower Division. What
material is not handled in undergrad
uate courses is taken up in the various
first-year law courses.
