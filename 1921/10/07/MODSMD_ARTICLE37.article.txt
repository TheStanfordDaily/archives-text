## 
### 
A meeting of the swimming team
was held yesterday afternoon at which
plans were discussed for the coming
season.
It was decided that the interclass
swimming meet should be scheduled
for November 20', two weeks from
yesterday. It was also decided to wait
until after this meet before choosing
captains for the varsity and freshman
teams, both swimming and water polo.
The interclass water polo series will
be planned out after the interclass
swimming meet.
Schniieder, '24, was elected to the
position of swimming manager for the
varsity team, to arrange for the vari
ous games and trips which the team
will take place in.
Coach Brandsten gave the men a
short talk in which he stressed the
necessity of personal co-operation of
every man on the teams if the swim
ming season this year is to be as big
a success, as it can be. "The prospects
are good," he said, when asked about
the freshman and varsity teams. "We
shall not be able to tell so much about
the freshmen until after the interclass
meet," he added, "but they seem to
have good material, and the varsity,
as we know, has some very good swim
mers." Included among the varsity
material are last year's sprint stars
such as Austin, Pinkston, world's
champion diver; Fletcher, last year's
freshman captain, and national ama
teur breast-stroke champion; and
others who proved their ability last
year.
