# TRYOUTS FOR YELL LEADER ASSISTANTS TO BE HELD AT GAME
## 
### 
The annual tryout for yell leader's
assistants will be held tomorrow at the
football game with St. Mary's college.
Robert Connolly, yell leader, has been
coaching about twelve juniors who have
aspirations to become assistants. The
regular method of choosing the assist
ants will be used. Every tryoutee will
be given opportunity to lead a number
of yells. Those present will be given
ballots upon which they can write the
numbers of the two tryoutees who they
think best qualified to fill the positions.
This will be the first real rally of the
year. After the assistants have been
chosen, Yell Leader Connolly plans to
have several bleacher rallies in the aft
ernoon in order that the large number
of freshmen and new students may learn
the Stanford yells and songs. Yell
Leader Connolly hopes to have a well
, organized rooting section by the time of
' the Big Game on November 19.
