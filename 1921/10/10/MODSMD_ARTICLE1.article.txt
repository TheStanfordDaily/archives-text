# HOYT, BOY PITCHER FOR YANKS, AGAIN CONQUERS GIANTS
## Youngster Clouted for Ten Hits But Holds McGraw's Sluggers In Tight Spots; Score is 3 to 1 
### United Press Wire 
POLO GROUNDS, NEW YORK, Oct. 10.—'Waite Hoyt,
the pink-faced Brooklyn school boy, added another sparkling
jewel to his heroes' crown here this afternoon, when he won
his second game for the Yanks, defeating the Giants, 3 to
1 in a bitterly fought game.
His victory made the count 3 to 2 in games for the Yanks
and gave the Giants, who had looked upon victory in this
game as the turning point in the series, a severe set-back.
Hoyt started out poorly in the first inning when the Giants
got their only run of the game. McNally fumbled Burns'
grounder and started the trouble. Frisch singled off the
young pitcher's glove and Young walked, filling the bases.
Kelly came through with a single and the only Giant run
of the game was over.
Art Nehf, the southpaw pitcher, started off in brilliant
form. The Yanks got to him, however, in the third inning,
when McNally reached third on Schang's double and scored
on Miller's sacrifice.
Babe Ruth, playing with a badly swollen left arm, singled
to open the fourth inning. It was a bunt that took the Giant

defense completely by surprise. Bob
Meusel smashed a double, scoring
Ruth, went to third on an infield out
and scored 011 Ward's sacrifice fly.
The fifth game of the series was
played under ideal weather conditions
and was witnessed by a crowd of 35,-
000 spectators.
Harry Harper, southpaw, is expected
for the Yanks, while McGraw may
to pitch tomorrow in the sixth game
start Jesse Barnes or Pat Shea.
