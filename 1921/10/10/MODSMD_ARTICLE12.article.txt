# SANTA CLARA BEATS LEGION ELEVEN, 7-0
## 
### 
Santa Clara demonstrated that she
is by no means out of athletics, when
Coach Buckingham's eleven downed
the American Legion team, by a 7 to
0 score, yesterday. The American
Legion held the strong Olympics to a
scoreless tie earlier in the season.
The game was hard-fought and
there was no score until the fourth
quarter when Manelli passed 35 yards
to Logan, who caught the ball behind
the goal line. Three times before
Santa Clara had the ball within the
Legion's ten-yard line, only to have
their chances ruined by a fumble. The
Santa Clara line played good foot
ball most of the game, and the Legi
on could do little with it on the of
fense.
