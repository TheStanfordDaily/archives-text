# ON THE BLEACHERS
## 
### 
Next Wednesday the first bleacher rally of the year will be held. It
is apparent from the showing made by the bleacher section in last Sat
urday's game that the students and the Yell Leader have not as yet
fallen into the old fighting spirit so marked in the rooting sections of
Stanford in the past. That the spirit is here has been evident from the
first day of the quarter but it was not manifested by the bleacherites
during last Saturday's game. The whole attitude of the Stanford gath
ering was that of the casual observer who is waiting to be convinced
that Stanford really has a football team worthy of the name before
committing himself.
Stanford is making an uphill fight. Sixty-five men are giving two
hours each day to practice. Five coaches are spending sixteen hours
each day to develop a winning team. The task that faces the coaches
is to build a line, and they have some of the best line material that has
been here since the resumption of the American game. Stanford, in
the third week of practice, defeats an eleven that has been working out
for two months. Vet the undergraduate body sits idly by with only an
occasional cheer for the eleven that is giving everything it has.
Wednesday is the day for the students to turn out in force to dem
onstrate to the football coaches and players that Stanford is backing
them at every turn. The prospects for a winning eleven were never
quite so promising as they are this season. The team that was in action
was merely an embryo of the team that will face the Blue and Gold
warriors in the bowl on November 1'). The line is in the earliest stages
of development. But one or two positions in it are cinched. Everyone
connected with the team in any way is literally working his head off to
develop a winner. Stanford students will have an opportunity to cor
rect the false impression created last Saturday by filling the bleachers
for the rally tomorrow and vocally attesting their faith in the men who
are working on the field.
But forty days remain before the Big Game will be played. There
is lots of work to be done by the Yell Leader, and his assistants who
will be chosen Wednesday afternoon. To do our share every student must
be present at the rally and every student must see that every other student
in the University knows everyone of the Stanford songs and yells. The
Yell Leader will see that we know how to sing them, and yell them.
