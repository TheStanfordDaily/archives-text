# Stanford Dames Call First Session Thursday
## 
### 
Opening the second year of its ex
istence, the Stanford Dames meet for
the first time, Thursday afternoon, at
3 o'clock, in the room of the Women's
Clubhouse. The chapter is enrolled
at seventy this year and expects to
admit quite a few of the new candi
dates. All wives of Stanford students
and professors who have not yet af
filiated themselves with the organiza
tion, are invited to attend Thursday's
meeting.
The Dames is a national organiza
tion having chapters in Harvard, Co
lumbia, Ohio, Illinois, lowa and Wis
consin universities. A recent com
munication from Harvard reported the
number of members at 150. The Stan
ford Dames this season hope to closely
approximate one hundred, when all
of the new eligibles will have affili
ated themselves.
