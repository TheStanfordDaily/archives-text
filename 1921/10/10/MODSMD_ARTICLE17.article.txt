# CABBAGES AND THINGS

• T.1., *23 •
Referee's ( squabble. Mary's
coach rushes out on field in rage.
Five minutes later, 'nother tiff. S.M.
coach one more on ear. Third time
and the bleachers wondered, "Is
Coach Madigan?"
* * *
This load of Cabbages introduces
the hoe-work of Gardener C. Shoup,
who will hereafter represent the vege
table staff to some extent on Mondays.
Gardener Shoup, although having
served up some terrible messes of
pottage in the course of his ap
prenticeship, has been elevated to the
right regal position of Guardian of
Garbage and wil henceforth take a
third part in the ruination of this
colyum.
* * *
Chief Shoveler H. Rorke, eminent
foolisher, will hereafter make Wed
nesdays a final examination for his
readers via this colyum. His subter
raneean wit merits his appointment
to this highly flattering office.
♦ * *
P. Newill, who is a little worse than
the limit, will furnish the corned beef
on Tuesdays. In his new office as
Head Worm Chaser, this egg is ex
pected to do his full third in hatching
out ruination for our patch.
* # *
These birds are all wearers of the
hat which furnishes its own music.
They expect to get away with a few
come-backs in justification of the loud
report which adorns their barber's
pasture. Attention! The Gardener
is going to serve up a few dishes
for you
# * *
Having been told expressly not to
pull off any rank joke about skunk
cabbage, we shall, of course, not do so.
Oh, no, of course not. At least, we
haven't done it yet, and, as the in
surance companies say, while there's
life, there's hope.
* * *
Freshman co-eds were probably
pleased at the reception they got yes
terday p.m. while marching up and
down the Row to the various tease
in squad formation. Masses of cheer
ing spectators banked alongside the
sidewalks really make rushing worth
while, don't you think, my de-ah? Or
don't you?
* * *
Just so one doesn't know just who's
looking at one. As friend Irwin would
say, "You don't know who I are, have
you?"
* * #
We understand that the intelligence
test proved a complete failure. Every
body passed, and what few fumbles
there were could hardly be noticed.
"Would a purple cow give purple
milk?" was the only question that
stumped the giant intellects of '25.
* »P *
And that's hardly a fair question,
when all the consumer gets these
times is purple milk.
* * *
All of which reminds us, that today
is the first blue Monday of the quar
ter. Last Monday was merely a light
shade of azure, although some of the
freshmen undoubtedly got blue in the
face trying to locate History 7 in the
Applied Mathematics Building.
* * *
If Monday is blue, what colors are
appropriate for the other days. For
the best suggestion to the above
query, we are willing to donate a
handsome book of The Inner Secrets
of Table Etiquette, bound in half-calf,
if the business office will supply us
with this book.
* * *
We are also willing to make an im
portant announcement. Anyone hav
ing questions which vex their various
minds are invited to send them in to
the Cabbage editor to answer, just so
they don't send 'em in on blue Mon
day. Questions of religious, social,
political, or economic value will not
he admitted. All others all welcome,
but expect an answer every time.
