# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM DEFEATS VIRTUS CLUB
## 
### 
Saturday afternoon on the soccer
field Coach Maloney's ?921 soccer var
sity met and defeated the fast San
Francisco Italia Vertus Club by the de
cisive score of 3-0. This was the first
game of the season, and considering the
fact that the varsity had only been prac
ticing for a week, it was a remarkable
showing. The team as a whole seemed
to be in poor condition, and lack of
teamwork was quite evident. Despite
these drawbacks the varsity showed real
dashes of speed and organization which
at all times put their opponents on the
defensive.
After a great deal of dribbling and
passing in the first half, Peavy, for the
Cardinals, headed in a long one, thereby
making the first score. The Virtus Club
rallied at this and it seemed for a time
that their forwards would break
through the Stanford defensive. Men
donca and Hays, however, were old
hands at the game, and succeeded in
keeping the goal practically free. Mas-
Masters at goal ready to stop any long
shots that got by the fullbacks. Cap
tain Gorman, as usual, proved his value
by breaking up the San Franciscoans'
offensive and by feeding the ball to his
forwards at opportune moments. Peavy
and Clark were the mainstays of the
varsity offensive, and consistently at
all times carried the battle to their
enemy's camp. They were responsible
for the two points made in the second
half, Clark scoring from a difficult angle
from the outside right position and
Peavy breaking through a mass of 'in
terference to make the score.
The Stanford line-up was: Masters,
G.G.; Mendonca, R.F.; Hays, L.F.;
Walthers, L.H.; Captain Gorman, C.H.;
Dwight, R.H.; Sanders, 0.L.; Mead,
1.L.; Peavy, C.F.; Mesa, 1.R.; Clark.
