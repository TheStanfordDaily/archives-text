# NEVADA SCORES, BUT BLUE AND GOLD WINS BY A 51 TO 7 TALLY
## 
### 
Coach Andy Smith's hopes of an
uncrossed California goal-line were
knocked into a cocked hat Saturday
afternoon, by Jimmy Bradshaw, the
diminutive Nevada quarter back. After
the California backs had plowed
through the weak Nevada line for 51
points, in the fourth quarter, Brad
shaw forward-passed and plunged his
way nearly half way down the field.
Then he hurled a sensational fifteen
yard pass to Reed on the fourth down,
and the latter ran 55 yards for a touch
down, making the final count of 51
to G.
The Blue and Gold backfiield of
Toomey, Erb, Nesbit, and Nichols,
made their yards almost at will, and
time after time pulled off long runs.
Bell, sub-half, surprised the bleacher
ites with his work. "Brick" Muller
received an injury to his knee which
will probably keep him on the side
lines for at least two weeks. It is
thought that he may be able to start
the University of Oregon game a
week from next Saturday.
The California freshmen overwhelm
ed the Mare Island Sailors, in the pre
liminary game, by a score of 76 to 0.
The Sailors are to be distinguished
from the Mare Island Marines, whom
the Stanford varsity defeated by a
score of 41 to 0, on October 1.

The second marriage of Stanford
couples since the beginning of the fall
quarters performed in the Memorial
Chapel was that of Miss Josephine Ter
rill, '21, and Eugene Robinson Paul, '21.
Mrs. Paul was prominent in campus dra
matics and was president of Masquer-
Dramatic Society. She assisted Mrs.
William Duffy Seay last quarter as di
rector of Conference work in her Oral
Expression classes. She is a member of
Gamma Phi Beta sorority. Paul was a
geology major, and is affiliated with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
