# SWORD AND SANDALS CASTS TONIGHT FOR 'TAILOR MADE MAN'
## H. J, Smith's Broadway Success to be Cast Tomorrow From Number of Tryoutees 
### 
"The Tailor Made Man," after run
ning for two solid seasons in New York
and about the country for several years,
lias been released for amateur produc
tion, and obtained by Sword and San
dals for presentation in a few weeks.
It is the story of a tailor's assistant
with an incurable destiny. The manu
script is by Harry J. Smith, which
guarantees its polish and humor, for
Smith has the reputation of being re
sponsible for more Broadway successes
than any other playwright. George M.
Cohan's patronage assures fire and pep
to those who put no credence in the
phenomenal record of the comedy.
Destinies run in several models, but
this tailor's particularly favors the so
cial ' route. When he appropriates the
star customer's dress suit all is set. He
makes the preliminaries and meets the
Wall Street Croesus in the second act
before he can move into the very com
plete office "set," act three, in which he
is exposed. It is a sad third act, for
the report intimates that Hi Finance has
been thrown and hog-tied by the mod
est hero, and developments promise to
be annoying for all concerned if destiny
is thwarted at so late a date and without
notice. But villains were ever thus, and
the fourth act finds him once more with
a grappled scissors and a resigned look.
All clears up when Mr. Wall-Street-
Midas enters and gathers in the recent
essential factor notwithstanding the fact
that lie is plotting matrimony with the
demure tailorette and not the more
"worthy" patrician damsel.
The cast for this play will be an
nounced tomorrow evening. Those
whose names are given here and who
