# DR. JORDAN Will TALK AT ASSEMBLY TONIGHT
## First "On the Boat" Assembly Will Give Frosh Chance to Learn Stanford History 
### 
Tonight at 7 :30 o'clock, in the Assem
bly Hall, will be held the first "on the
boat" assembly for freshmen, conducted
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.,
the Y. W. C. A., and Associated Stu
dents. The speaker of the evening will
be Dr. David Starr Jordan.
Dr. Jordan will talk on "Stanford
History and Ideals," giving the new
students an opportunity to learn of the
past history of the university from the
man most influential in shaping it, and
giving them also a chance to absorb
the knowledge of some of the customs
and traditions that have come to build
up Stanford ideals. The early years of
the university were eventful, often pre
carious ones, and how the institution
weathered the storm and grew to its
present-day magnitude, is part of the
story that Dr. Jordan will relate.
