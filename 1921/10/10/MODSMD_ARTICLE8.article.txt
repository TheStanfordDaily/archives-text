### R. H. Edwards, '23 C. H. Prior, '23 
Coach Duffy Seay's freshman foot
ball squad was held to a 7-7 tie by
the fast Berkeley High School eleven,
in Saturday morning's contest. The
team from the bay region decidedly
outplayed the Cardinal Babes in the
first quarter, keeping the ball in fresh
man territory and threatening the
goal twice. During the rest of the
game the playing was fairly even.
Berkeley's aggregation was "specially
heavy for a prep school; and, the exe
cution of plays was effectively swift,
the farword pass being very success
ful.
The freshmen kicked off and the.
Berkeley receiver was dropped in the
25-yard line. Berkeley started off
with a rush. Yardage was made by
two plays, a right end run for 8 yards
and a buck. A pass and a short end
run gave them another first down.
They plugged the line for short gains
to the 25-yard line, where they lost the
ball on downs. Cuddeback kicked to
Berkeley's 40-yard line and the high
school boys began the march up the
field again. After carrying the ball
to Stanford's 18-yard line, the fresh
man line held, and Berkeley passed
over the goal line on the 4th down.
The freshmen took the ball on their
own 20-yard line and showed that
they also could gain ground. They
carried the ball to midfield but lost
it there on downs. Berkeley immedi
ately kicked, and the gun sounded as
lie ball was downed on the 25-yard
line. Stanford freshmen 0, Berkeley
High 0.
The babes would not gain at the
opening of the second quarter, and
Berkeley again got the ball on downs.
With 0 yards to gain on the 4th down,
Dennis had failed to call for a kick.

The second team of thee Cardinal
Babes were held to the small end of
a 14 to 13 score, by the Salinas High
School eleven, in a curtain-raiser game
which preceded the Stanford-St.
Mary's battle, on the local field, Sat
urday afternoon.
Throughout the contest the Babe
second-stringers played a loose, and
ragged game, and the victory of the
high school squad was practically a
donation. Weak tackling and in
ability to fathom the mysteries of the
Salinas passing game, were the causes
of the final outcome. lmlay, the
super-little man of the visitors, play
ed the star role of the game, getting
away with two long runs which netted
touchdowns and playing a strong
game on the defense.
Hadley, the Babe half-back, ran
lmlay a close second for honors, com
pleting a long pass in the first quarter
and getting away for a long run in
the third which was converted into a
touchdown.
Harris at left, and Macrorie at full
played strong games with flashes of
brilliancy, Harris coming ill for good
defensive work during the first part
of play and Macrorie taking the ball
over for the first touchdown.
The first quarter was a series of
penalties and fumbles with the one
redeeming feature of a well-executed
pass from Macree to Hadley, which
gave the babes their first tallies.
It was in the last two minutes of
play that the elusive lmlay got away
with a punt and took his unmolested
way through freshman territory,
scoring the winning touchdown.
Berkeley made 1 and 10 twice in rapid
succession, but Howard intercepted a
pass on his own five-yard line. This
ended Berkeley's chance to score in
the first half. After several ex
changes of kicks, the '25 men got the
ball in midfield and marched down the j
side line for 30 yards by line plung
ing, short end runs, and tackle around I
plays. A run around left end played I
the ball on Berkeley's 8-yard line. I
With four downs to make it in, the
freshmen took the ball to the 1-yard
line in two plunges, only to lose it
on a fumble. The half ended with
Berkeley preparing to kick out of
danger from behind her own goal.
Stanford freshmen 0 1 , Berkeley Hi 0.
Berkeley kicked off over the goal
line and the ball was put in play on
the 20-yard mark. After an exchange
of kicks, Cuddeback made a poor punt
and Berkeley got the ball on Stan
ford's 35-yard line. They made a
pretty pass for a touchdown after
starting on a faked end run but the
play was called back because of off
side. After two line plunges had fail
ed, Berkeley attempted to repeat the
play, but it was broken up back of
the line for a 5-yard loss. Dennis
caught a punt on his own goal line
and returned the ball to the 15-yard
mark.
Here Gilliland took the ball and
made 40 yards around right end. His
open field running was brilliant. After
failing to complete two forward pass
es, the freshmen kicked to Berkeley's
20-yard line. Cuddeback was injured
and left the game. The ball see
sawed back and forth for a time.
Then Berkeley got it in midfield and
kicked over the freshman goal. On
the next play Gilliland ran 80 yards
through a broken field for a touch
down. Dennis kicked the goal. The
freshmen kicked off and Berkeley
made 1 and 10 off tackle. A pass
netted 14 yards more. The period
ended with / the ball in Berkeley's
possession on the 30-yard line. Stan
ford freshmen 7, Berkeley High o>.
Almost immediately after the whistle
sounded for the opening of the fourth
quarter, McCfausland hurled a fine
pass 25 yards to Couper, who romped
j the remaining 5 yards for a touch
dawn. Berkeley converted. The
j freshmen made a desperate attempt
!to win by a touchdown. After receiv
j ing the kick-off they made two first
downs and then got the ball well into
I Berkeley's territory by a 20-yard for
ward pass. They failed to gain
through the line, however, and Den
nis dropped back to try a field goal.
The ball sailed straight as a die but
fell 5 yards short. Berkeley kicked
out of danger and the game ended
with them carrying the ball in mid
field.
Final score, Stanford freshmen 7;

Berkeley High, 7.
