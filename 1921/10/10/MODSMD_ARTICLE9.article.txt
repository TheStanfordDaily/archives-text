# SAINTS LOSE TO VARSITY AS BACKFELD FUMBLES
## Transbay Gridmen Fail to Follow Pigskin and Lose Close Battle to Van Gent's Men by Score of 10-7 
### E. C. West, '23 
Taking advantage of fumbles at criti
cal periods of the game and using them
both for offensive and defensive play,
the Stanford varsity won from St.
Mary's on the Cardinal field Saturday
afternoon, 10 to 7.
Stanford won because St. Mary's
fumbled and because Gene Van Gent's
men followed the ball better than the
players from the transbay institution.
But the victory was not won without
a last-minute drive by the St. Mary's!
backs, which menaced the Card goal line,
and which might have changed the en->
tire story had not Bahan, captain of the
visitors, fumbled just as the offensive
which he had started reached its climax
eight yards from its objective.
There was a dive for the ball. Three
Cardinal-jerseyed men were at the bot

torn of the pack. Captain Jack Patrick
went back of liis own goal and spiraled
the ball out fifty yards, sending with it
the last chance of a St. Mary's win.
It was a fumble by the visitors which
paved the way for the Stanford touch
down in the first quarter. Patrick had
just kicked into St. Mary's territory.
Charging into the Cardinal line, Stock
ton dropped the ball and DeGroot, who
stood out Saturday as a bulwark of
strength in the Van Gent defense, re
covered on the St. Mary's eighteen-yard
mark.
It was such following of the ball that
gave Stanford the edge. A Cardinal
avalanche with Patrick, then Doughty,
carrying the ball, took over the first
score of the game. Art Wilcox con
verted.
St. Mary's tied the score with a sweep
ing offensive that started from their
own twenty-yard line near the close of
the first quarter. Varying witli line
plunges by the burly Stockton from
short off-tackle gains by Silva, the
Saints carried the ball without losing it
at any time over the Card goal line. A
well-executed forward pass to Bahan
netted thirty yards while the march was
under way.
Lane made the touchdown and Black
converted.
Captain Patrick's drop kick from the
twenty-yard line in the last quarter gave
Stanford the necessary points for a vic
tory. It came after the Cards had taken
the ball from near midfield to within ten
yards of the Saints' goal.
St. Mary's advantage in yards gained
and first downs made was more than
nullified by fumbles at critical points
during the game and by poor kicking.
Patrick averaged close to fifty yards
with his boots. Black for St. Mary's
constantly booted out of bounds or high
and short in the air for an average of
scarcely thirty yards.
DeGroot at center for Stanford
loomed as the best lineman on either
team. Carter at tackle and Mertz at
end both shown to advantage.
Captain Jack Patrick and Ray
Doughty did most of the offensive work
in the Card backfield.
Neither St. Mary's nor Stanford was
able to use the aerial attack with any
degree of success. The visitors com
pleted one out of seven, and Van
Gent's eleven worked two out of eight.
