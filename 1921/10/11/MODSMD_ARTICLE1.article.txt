# CASI ANNOUNCED FOR SWORD AND SANDALS COMEDY
## Lester Seib to Lead Opposite Dorothy Woodhead, in H.J. Smith's 'Tailor-Made Man' 
### 
Lester Seib, who took the lead in
Sword and Sandals' production last
year, "Pierre of the Plains," lias been
chosen to play John Paul Part, the tailor
made man. In fact, last year's leads are
entirely intact, for Dorothy Woodhead,
who played opposite Seib's Pierre, will
do Tanya Huber in the H. J. Smith
comedy. Paul Claflin lias one of the
best comedy parts of the show, and Mil
dred Finley, recently returned to Stan
ford, will play the grass widow who can
never be seen from behind because of a
thick cloud of dust.

Seib has been prominent in campus
dramatics since he was a freshman. Last
year his contributions were mostly con
lined to coaching. "Bubbling Bohemia"
and "Maid to Order" were supervised by
him. This summer he appeared on the
campus with the Greek Theatre Players
from Berkeley and took the lead in
"Heart of Pierrot," which he will play
again by request this Saturday.
Dorothy Woodhead is cast as the tail
or's daughter. From honey to saccha
rine, the entire catalogue of sweetnesses
is to be delivered in a composite picture.
She keeps the entire male personnel of
the shop away from their pressing af
fairs, and after John Paul has left his
idyllic poverty to become prosaically
rich, her heart splashes in such a flood
of sweetness that John Paul comes back
and, takes on all the vows she'll read
him.
Terribly sorry, willing to do anything
to make amends, and with such a fetch
ing English assumption, is Mr. Jellicot,
played by Paul Claflin. He is equally at
ease in any clothes, and in any position,
which is not at all. As long as there is
something to fret about, be it even a
spat's button, life's purpose is complete
enough to continue existence. Claflin
will be remembered as the Englishman
of "Bubbling Bohemia" and as "Clar
ence."
That terribly fast grass widow is Mil
dred Finley. The dope has it that she
will capture the show with her voice,
even though she is no more like a grass
widow than a cotton sock. The grass,
however, will not be painted green, and
by all the tokens of the manuscript, there
will be no need for her to say a word to
win.
Besides the names already mentioned
there are twenty-seven other persons in
the play. Coach Davis wants to see
them all at 7 :30 tonight for the first re
hearsal.

hearsal.
