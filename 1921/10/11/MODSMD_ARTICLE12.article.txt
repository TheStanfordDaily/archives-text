# DR. JORDAN TALKS AT FRESHMAN ASSEMBLY
## Stanford's Early History and Traditions Are Subjects of Address at First Meeting 
### 
"The self-made man isn't in the game
now; he sometimes uses the wrong ma
terials and makes his head of wood."
1 his was Dr. Jordan's opinion expressed
in his address 011 the founding and early
history of Stanford at the freshman
meeting in the Assembly Hall, Monday
night. "Thirty years ago, I greeted the
first freshman class of Stanford," Dr.
Jordan began. "At that time there was
no town of Palo Alto, 110 University
buildings, 110 roads, no automobiles, and
only one telephone this side of San Jose.
Four hundred sixty-five students regis
tered in the University that fall."
He then described the founding of the
University in memory of Governor and
Mrs. Stanford's only son, Leland Stan
ford. They visited Johns Hopkins, Har
vard, Yale, Cornell, and other eastern
institutions to gather ideas for the pro
posed university. Ihe early years were
eventful and precarious ones when the
existence of the University was threat
ened by lack of funds, owing to Gov
ernor Stanford's estate being tied up at
his death. After long and expensive
lawsuits, the finances of the University
were straightened out and its upward
development was constant.
"The aim of this institution is to train
young men and women to be useful in
life," declared Dr. Jordan. "At Stan
ford the student finds a democracy of
studies, beautiful surroundings, and the
chance to know and love fine men. One
of the best things about the place is the
faculty; get acquainted with themâ€”
especially your major professors."
In connection with the history of
Stanford, Dr. Jordan described briefly
the careers of Governor Stanford and
others who have been associated with
its founding and development.
Leland Stanford was born in Albany.
He went to Wisconsin to practice law,
and when his offices there burned down
lie came to Red liluff and started a gen
eral store. He was successful, and later
started law offices in Sacramento. After
ward he became governor of California,
and was then instrumental in keeping
the state in the Union. Stanford and
three other men built the Central Pa
cific and the Union Pacific, with govern
ment aid, and with the money they made
they later constructed the Southern Pa
cific.
It was after the death of their only
son, Leland, in Italy that the Stanfords
considered the question of what to do
with their wealth. " J hey were in great
distress, until," according to Dr. Jordan,
"as Governor Stanford told me he woke
one morning with the words on his lips,
'The children of California shall be my
children.' " This was the beginning of
the plan to erect Stanford University as
i a memorial to the boy they had lost.
The meeting was well attended, a
number of upperclassmen as well as
j freshmen being present.
