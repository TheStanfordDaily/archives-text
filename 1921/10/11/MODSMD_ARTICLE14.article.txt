# ROOTERS TO PRACTICE NEW BLEACHER SONG
## 
### 
Stanford's new song, "Fight for
Stanford," will be introduced at the
bleacher rally to be held tomorrow
afternoon at 3:30. The words and
music were composed by C. W. Midg
ley, '23. An absolutely novel tune is
promised, while the words are as fol
lows:
Warriors of Stanford on the field,
So tense as the time draws nigh,
Hear, sounding, bounding, to the sky,
Our ancient battle-cry.
CHORUS:
Fight for Stanford,
Give your all for Stanford,
Hit 'em hard and low for Stan
ford, Stanford;
We're behind you,
Heart and soul behind you,
Fight for victory, Cardinal team.
Yell Leader Bob Connolly asks that
everyone cut out the words to the
song so as to be able to practice it
at the bleachers tomorrow. He also
requests that all freshmen bring their
bibles. The 60-piece Stanford Band
will be on hand.
At this time elections will be held
for the two assistant yell leaders. Fif
teen men are trying out, and from
the work they have gone through so
far, a keen contest may be expected
when they begin the movements with
a meaning tomorrow.
Throughout the rally, the freshman
and varsity squads will hold scrim
mages.
It is important that everyone pos
sible attends, says Yell Leader Con
nolly, so that an efficient rooting sec
tion may be ready to go to the city
next Saturday, for the game with the
| Olympic Club.
