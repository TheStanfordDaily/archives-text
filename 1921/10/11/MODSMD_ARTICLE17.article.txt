"Come, Join the Band" might well l>e the call for the bleacher rally
tomorrow afternoon. The Stanford hand which furnished the music
while Stanford was winning Saturday's football contest, will be on the
job at the football field tomorrow to aid Yell Leader Connolly in putting
over the first bleacher rally of the year. Much credit is due to the Stan
ford band for its willingness to turn out tomorrow. Several of the hand
men are working during their spare time, and it requires a sacrifice on
their part to play on class days. Nevertheless, they have signified their
willingness to be on hand for tomorrow's yell practice.
All that remains now is to see that the entire student body is on the
bleachers by 3 :30, when practice will begin. With this first rally the Yell
Leader will start organizing for the Big Game. He will introduce one
new song tomorrow and will have copies of all of the old songs on hand
so that every new student can secure them.
It is needless to say that it is imperative that every member of the
student body should be on hand for tomorrow's workout. Stanford will
play host to California and sixty thousand people on the day of the
Big Game, and since that will be a large affair an early start must be
secured. Also the students will pass on the candidates for the Assistant
Yell Leader positions and will choose two to act in that capacity for the
rest of the year.
Coaches Van Gent and Duffy Seay will line up the Varsity and
Freshman elevens in a scrimmage, which will be part of the rally. The
opportunity of seeing Stanford's two football aggregations in action
against each other is in itself sufficient attraction to bring every live
member of the student bodv on the run.
