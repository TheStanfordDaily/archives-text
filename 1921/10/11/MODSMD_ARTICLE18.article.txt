# THE 						CREW SITUATION
## 
### 
"What about crew?" is a question that is asked every year about this
time by those who are interested in the sport. Crew was dropped last
season because of a lack of sufficient funds to carry it on properly.
Because of the great distance to a body of water large enough to
permit training, the difficulties of transporting the varsity and freshman
squads to the Redwood slough daily, and the fact that a. complete new
set of shells and equipment had to be purchased last season it was deemed
advisable to wait until rowing could be put on a firm basis before resum
ing it.
The Board of- Athletic Control figures that it will cost in the neigh
borhood of $15,000 a year to conduct the sport properly at Stanford. It
is planned to erect a boathouse where the shells, rowing machines, and
equipment, to maintain a truck or trucks with which to convey the men
to the practice area every day, and to make ample provision in the budget
for sending a crew to the Atlantic Coast in an effort to repeat the Pough
keepsie success of 1915. Such a plan, it is apparent, would entail the
outlay of a great deal of money, but it is the only practical way in which
to resume the sport.
The necessity for constructing a stadium and basketball pavilion were
regarded as more urgent than keeping a crew in the water. The receipts
from games played in the new stadium and basketball pavilion will pro
duce a budget sufficient to bring back crew stronger than it ever was
before. Right now the task that faces the student body is to keep alive
the interest in rowing as a sport. I bis does not seem to be especially
difficult. Men who have rowed in the shells of varsity and freshman
crews claim that there is no other sport quite so interesting to or gripping
on the participant as the water sport. The men who have rowed on
varsity, second varsity, and freshman crews will hold a meeting tomorrow
night to revive interest in crew. This alone is proof that a revival is not
necessary, for the men probably will assure themselves that interest is
very much alive and console each other with the thought that the time for
the resumption of the sport is not very far off.
