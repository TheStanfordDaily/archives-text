# SEQUOIA CLUB MEN TO HAVE TENNIS MATCHES
## 
### 
Following out the idea of preparing
and developing good players through
intramural matches, the Athletic Com
mittee of Sequoia Hall has announced
an inter-Hall tennis tournament to be
played in the next three weeks on the
new club courts. Any man in the hall
is eligible for the match, and the com
mittee in charge hopes to uncover some
promising material for the intramural
contest. Sequoia Hall has recently se
cured the old Ruble tennis courts, lying
west of the hall, and after they have
been surfaced and rolled they will be in
excellent condition for playing. Later,
a handicap tournament will be held.
