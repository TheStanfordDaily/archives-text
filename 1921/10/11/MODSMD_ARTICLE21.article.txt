# CABBAGES AND THINGS
## 
### 
i T.1., '23
Some' gardeners depend in a large
measure tor livelihood upon a volun
teer crop. If somebody volunteered a
Cabbage for this patch, Chief Shoveler
Nevill and ye ed. would declare Tues
day a national bathday.

There must be a lot of funny guys
around this here institution. Any
way, none of 'em ever get any of the
humor out of their systems unless it's
kickin' the cane out of some octege
narian's mitt. What we needs to make
this colyum weedproof is a few active
contributors.
* * *
Honest, some duck submitted that
old chestnut about "My wife went —
so-and-so —Jamaica? No, Cuba!" the
other day and looked peevish because
ti wasn't run for an original. Gad
Zooks, friends, ain't there 110 justice?
* * *
Ye ed. plus sub-eds, like Barkis, is
always willin'. Send some of that
stuff with a kick in it to the Daily and
get a come-back. We'll even open a
matrimonial agency if necessary, or as
a last resort print the picture of the
1 Cabbage staff.
* * ♦
If the last mentioned don't raise a
laugh, there ain't 110 sense of humor
left in this community. The boss of
this sheet says we got to lengthen
the colyum. He don't know people
j will only stand so much. We lost
I one subscriber last year by starting
| Cabbages out. Addled Abie says we
oughtn't have quit with starting.

Full many a flower has lived to
blush unseen; full many a man but
not so many full: —U. B. Blest.
* * *
We ought to enlarge our Mining
; and Geology Department, we've got
so doggone many gold-diggers here: —
N. G. Neer.

A Stockton contemporary says.
! "Fawcett is playing end for Stanford.
California hopes to turn it off."
* * *
The same party is responsible for
I this, "Palo Alto, Nov. I.—The first
j fan for the Stanford-California foot
| ball game on November 19th, took his
'place in line here today, at 10:12
; a.m."
* * *
DID YOU EVER STOP TO THINK
THAT:
Six million, a hundred and twenty
thousand pounds of people will oc
cupy the Stadium, November 19?
They will eat about three million
peanuts?
* * *
The visitors would form a line 34
miles long? That all the time spent
by the visitors in seeing one football
game amounts to over 82 years? You
could double these statistics if there
were room.
* * *
The handiwork of Shoveler Newill,
recently delegated or relegated to the
position above stated, offers below a
sample of what he has just unearthed.
The first is a spadeful in any ditch
diggers' league.
* * *
Thieves in our midst. Several cords
of wood were stolen from the football
bleachers Saturday. The criminals
were said to be wearing tweed pants.
♦ • *
Those eating peanuts between halves
should call their shots.
♦ * *
Berkeley residents are demanding
that the bells in the Campanile be
tuned. No need for it. They-ll play
a different tune after November 19,
anyway.
♦ * *
113 degrees this summer. Hot stuff.
♦ * *
If you dislike this, try the post
office. It always has a heavy line.
* * *
Discovered: —A use for Soph hats.
They're just the thing to take notes
on in class. Lefax sales reporter fall
ing off already.
* * *
Cometh now the Ex . Committee
which decrees that the pretty decora
tions must be removed. Oh, for a
Cleaner's agency!
♦ * *
Latest reports say that the hous
ing and tuition . problems have been
solved. Sophs have all moved into
Room 240, and they even carry $s
011 their hats.

SMOKE-UPS OFTEN COME IN
PiPES.
