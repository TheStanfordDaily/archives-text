# GREATEST ACTIVITY IN CARDINAL TENNIS PROMISED FOR YEAR
## 
### 
Interest and activity in tennis at Stan
! ford promises to be greater this year
than ever before, according to reports
from tennis managers. An elaborate
schedule for the playing of interclub
matches is being planned, and trips to
bay region courts will be made by the
freshmen, and especially by the large
varsity squad. Six-man teams will par
ticipate in tliese contests. This outside
! competition and frequent tournaments
! on the local courts are intended to build
up the strongest net aggregation which
has represented the Cardinal.
Negotiations are under way by the
tennis manager and Graduate Manager
Fletcher to secure members of the Jap
anese Davis Cup team to officially open
the new varsity courts. The Japanese
players were runners-up in the world
championship tournaments held in the
Fast this summer. The team, consisting
of Zenzo, Shimedzu, Icliiya, and Ku
magee, lias made a tour across the
United States, playing a series of exhi
bition matches, and will reach the Pa
cific Coast within a week. On October
16th they will play exhibition matches
with William M. Johnston, Willis Davis,
and other stars at the Berkeley Tennis
Club. If plans are Successful, the Jap
anese tennis wizards will appear at Stan
ford during the first of next week.
Throughout the year, weekly if possible,
exhibitions will be given 011 the local
courts by such net marvels as Johnston,
present world's doubles champion, Willis
Davis, and "Peck" Griffith. It is in
tended by those in charge of tennis here
to make the sjort a paying proposition
so that more adequate provision may be
made for its needs.
The increasing popularity of tennis is
attested to by the more than 170 men
playing each day and the large number
refused registration 011 account of the
scarcity of courts. Six new courts now
under construction will be completed
within several weeks, and will relieve
the present congestion. Athletic Direc
tor Walter Powell lias arranged for six
additional courts which will be con
structed in the near future in case the
present facilities arc not sufficient. Oc
tober 15th is the last date 011 which en
tries may be made for the university
open singles and doubles tournament.
The matches will begin as soon as the
new courts are completed. Ihe Sequoia
courts may have to be used.
Intramural competition will be pushed
when space on the courts permits. The
j tennis manager would like to have en-
I tries made within a short time. A reg
' ular playing schedule for all the tourna-
I ments will be posted on the bulletin
I board in Encina Gymnasium.

championship tournaments held in the
Fast this summer. The team, consisting
of Zenzo, Shimedzu, Icliiya, and Ku
magee, lias made a tour across the
United States, playing a series of exhi
bition matches, and will reach the Pa
cific Coast within a week. On October
16th they will play exhibition matches
with William M. Johnston, Willis Davis,
and other stars at the Berkeley Tennis
Club. If plans are Successful, the Jap
anese tennis wizards will appear at Stan
ford during the first of next week.
Throughout the year, weekly if possible,
exhibitions will be given 011 the local
courts by such net marvels as Johnston,
present world's doubles champion, Willis
Davis, and "Peck" Griffith. It is in
tended by those in charge of tennis here
to make the sjort a paying proposition
so that more adequate provision may be
made for its needs.
The increasing popularity of tennis is
attested to by the more than 170 men
playing each day and the large number
refused registration 011 account of the
scarcity of courts. Six new courts now
under construction will be completed
within several weeks, and will relieve
the present congestion. Athletic Direc
tor Walter Powell lias arranged for six
additional courts which will be con
structed in the near future in case the
present facilities arc not sufficient. Oc
tober 15th is the last date 011 which en
tries may be made for the university
open singles and doubles tournament.
The matches will begin as soon as the
new courts are completed. Ihe Sequoia
courts may have to be used.
Intramural competition will be pushed
when space on the courts permits. The
j tennis manager would like to have en-
I tries made within a short time. A reg
' ular playing schedule for all the tourna-
I ments will be posted on the bulletin
I board in Encina Gymnasium.
