# Bar association RAISES STANDARDS FOR LAW SCHOOLS
## 
### 
Resolutions passed by the American
Bar Association will result in great
changes in the present system of legal
education, is the opinion of Dean Huston
of the Law School, who represented
's annual
inner,
standard

ouncil on

and Chief
>tion. The

(a) They

(b) They must require tnree years of
law study, if the student devotes his
full time. If not, there must be four
years of professional work, (c) They
must provide adequate libraries (5000
volumes). That every candidate should
have to pass bar examinations. That
the Bar Association should publish a
list of the law schools conforming to
this standard, and a list of those not
conforming.
"This marks an advance in legal
education comparable to the advance
made in medicine when there was a
classification of medical schools," said
Dean Huston. The practical effect, he
thinks, will be to force the night and
part-time law schools out of business.
The Stanford Law School will in no
way be affected, as its requirements are
already more rigid than those prescribed
by the Bar Association.
