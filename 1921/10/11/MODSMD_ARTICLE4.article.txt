# GIANTS POUND YANKEE PITCHERS FOR 8-5 WIN
## McGraw's Team Evens Series Hammering Harper, Shawkey 
### United Press Wire 
POLO GROUNDS, NEW YORK, Oct. 11 .—Jess Barnes,
the slim, serious-faced Giant star, eased into heroes' row
this afternoon, when he downed the Yanks 8 to 5, in the
sixth game of the world's series.
Barnes curve-balled the murderers' row of the American
League into submission and evened the count three to three
in the race for the championship.
After ponderous Fred Toney had been pounded for three
hits and three runs in the first inning, Barnes rushed to the
rescue and retired the side in the second inning. He was
bumped for two hits, a single by Shawkey, and a homer by
Fewster, who made good in the role as a substitute for the
great Babe Ruth.
Barnes struck out ten men and allowed only two hits in
the last seven innings. He had the Yank sluggers swinging
foolishly at his fast curves.
Harry Harper, star southpaw of the Yank staff, started
on the mound for the American League Champions, but he
lasted only a little longer than Toney.
Kelly walked to start the second inning and "Irish" Meu
sel did some of his stuff by hitting a home-run into the right

field stands. Rawlings flied out and
big Frank Snyder smashed a home
run into the left field bleachers.
Barnes then singled and Harper was
taken out.
Shawkey who relieved him was wild
and narrowly escaped until the fourth
inning, when four hits and an error,
gave the Giants four more runs.
The series now stands three and
three and the prospect of it going the
full nine games looks good.
