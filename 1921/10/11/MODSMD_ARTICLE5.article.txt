Professor Home will discuss the re
forms and changes which have been
brought about in the national and pro
vincial governments of India as a direct
result of the World War. At present
Tndia is a separate unit in the League of
Nations and has representatives at
Geneva. Professor Home says that
India has much more control of all
branches of her own affairs and has
freedom which compares favorably with
that of other parts of the British Em
pire. He will take up the question of
the struggle between a group of vision
aries led by Mr. Gandhi, who are at the
present time struggling with the estab
lished authority of India.

delivering lectures on Tndia. In the
spring semester of 1921 he was a mem
ber of the Harvard faculty and gave
courses on the History and Government
of India in the Division of History and

that time he has been lecturing at the
Universities of Chicago, Minnesota, and
Michigan, and has been visiting and lec
turing on the Pacific Coast this fall.
