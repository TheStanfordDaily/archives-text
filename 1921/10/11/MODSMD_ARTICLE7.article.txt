# SEAY MAKES FIRST CUT IN FRESHMAN FOOTBALL SQUAD
## 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay made the first big
cut in the freshman football squad last
night when he reduced the first-year
aggregation to forty players. The fresh
man squad this year has been one of the
largest in the history of the University,
and with the Big Game for the '25 class
only a few weeks off, Coach Seay and
his staff found it necessary to limit the
squad. Another cut will probably be
made in a week or so.
Saturday morning the freshmen will
line up against the Stockton High School
eleven, the game being played on the
Stanford turf at 10:30. Stockton has
been playing good football this year, and
the Cardinal Babes will find themselves
against a good team Saturday.
In the double-header played by the
freshmen last Saturday, the Babes
showed several weaknesses both in of
fense and defense. These, however,
should be remedied by next Saturday.
Coaches Seay and Mularkey are paying
special attention to the defensive play
ing of the backtield this week, and the
freshman backs should show a big im
provement over their playing last Sat
urday against Berkeley and Salinas
Highs.
Hayes, who has been trying out for
the center and guard positions, has been
showing up well in the recent scrim
mages, and if he continues to improve at
the present rate will give the regulars a
cause for worry before the season is
over. Cuddeback and together
with Howard and Gilliland, are develop
ing into a fast backtield combination, and
with substitutes such as McCrorie and
Hooper, Coach Seay is not worrying
over his backfield prospects.
