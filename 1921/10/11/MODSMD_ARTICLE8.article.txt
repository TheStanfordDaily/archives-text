## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will give an address in
Room 12, tomorrow evening, un
clcr the auspices of the Nestoria Debat
ing Society, on Disarmament. The his
tory of the disarmament movement, as
well as the situation in its present
phases in relation to the conference at
Washington, will form the basis of his
talk.
Much of Dr. Jordan's life has been
spent in a crusade for liberalism and
fair play between nations, and the com
ing disarmament conference may realize
the goal of his labors. In view of the
fact that he ha- been a staunch advocate
of the principles underlying disarma
ment in the past, his message to the
public at this time is of special moment,
