# VAN GENT DRILLS GRID SQUAD BACK OF CLOSED GATES
## Olympic Club Scrap Saturday Promises to Be One of the Hardest of Varsity Season 
### 
Head Coach Gene Van Gent had his
football cohorts scrimmaging, drilling
and passing behind closed doors this
afternoon.
With the Olympic Club battle set
for Saturday, at Ewing field, San
Francisco, the Stanford mentor in
tends to put in some good licks this
week, toward smoothing out the
rough places that showed themselves
in the St. Mary's struggle the other
day.
The Card teams will be behind
closed doors twice each week here
after. Those two days will be Tues
days and Fridays, and no one will
be allowed on the field except squad
members and the coaches. Even the
gymnasium staff will be barred.
Saturday's battle in San Francisco
promises to be one of the hardest of
the season for Van Gent's men. The
Olympic Club has rounded up a heavy
and exeprienced eleven, recruiting
largely from ex-college stars. Two
weeks ago they played the "wonder
team" from California to a standstill,
despite the fact that the Bears were
able to chalk up a slight advantage
in the score.
On two occasions the club outfit
carried the ball within striking dist
ance of the California goal, and no
less than three times braced and held
for four downs within five yards of
their own goal.
This tends to show that the Olympics
have not only a strong offensive ag
gregation, but even a better defense.
There can be no question of the fact
that Van Gent faces a difficult situa
tion.
"Dud" De Groot, varsity center, is
probably out of Saturday's fracas. He
has three cracked ribs and may be out
of the game for several weeks. "Bud"
Woodward is also laid up, and Ted
Mertz reported for practice last night,
with his hand tied up in splints.
With DeGroot out the game, it
is probab -i Miat Fred Ludeke, the big
fellow who played a guard position on
Duffy Seay's freshman team last year,
will be shifted to center for the "O"
Club game.
Graduate manager W. D. Fletcher
today announced that Stanford would
have a section in the oleachcrs for
the Olympic Club game. Tickets are
now on sale at various places on the
campus.
"Red ' Betts, veteran of the famous
14-10 game of two years ago, is in
good shepe again, and may break into
the Olympic Club contest. Betts has
been laid up for two weeks with eye
trouble but was out in suit last night
ready for active work. Betts played
guard in the 1919 battle.
