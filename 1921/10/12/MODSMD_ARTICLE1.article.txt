# FIGHTING SPIRIT SHOWN IN OPENING ASSEMBLY
## President Evans Asks Co-operation Of Entire Student Body; Honor System and Activities Outlined 
### 
Stanford is out to get "thai gang across the Bay," and to show that Stan
ford spirit and sportsmanship are permanent fixtures of the University. This
was the underlying message giveti to the student body by the seven student
speakers at the Assembly held at 10 o'clock this morning.
"This institution is what We make it." said Dan Evans, "22, president of the
Associated Students, opening the Assembly. "The stadium is a permanent
monument of Stanford spirit and it shows that our alumni are back of us; the
honor system and the abolition of probation show that the faculty is back of us,
and the rest is up to us."
President Evans brought out strongly the need of Stanfprd as a unit and
not as divided into geographical sections. The student body should co-operate
for one compact group and work together for one common end—the progress
of the University and its activities, he pointed out. "We're becoming too so
phisticated and worldly wise and are afraid to be real college men," lie con
tinued. "A few years ago the parlor snake was an object of derision on the
campus, but today that class is increasing. It is manifested in the marked

falling off in the number of men going
out for activities. It's a pure case of
passing the buck, and is not the attitude
of real Stanford men."
Evans appealed directly to the women
students for help in ridding the campus
of the "tea-hound" variety. "The social
attitude and standards are in your
hands," he said, "and we ask you to act
as a committee of five hundred to kill
this 'four hundred' idea."
Mary Mathews, '22, president of Or
ganized Women, spoke briefly on the
women's participation in student activi
ties. The women's own organization
give? them training in student govern
ment and tits them to help in all student
affairs, she said.
"It is only by every underclassman
getting into the game early, that we can
hope to keep up the standard of student
activities," said Wylie Kilpatrick, '23,
editor of the Quad, in speaking on stu
dent interests. No other university has
a better rounded out field of journalism
than Stanford, he pointed out, citing the
Daily Palo Alto, the Quad, and the
monthly magazines, Pictorial, Cardinal,
and Chaparral. There is need for new
material on all of these publications,
and Kilpatrick urged that new men and
women seek out the editors of the spe
cial publication in which they are inter
ested to try out for work. The chances
for participation in dramatics are. many,
said Kilpatrick. The dramatic work is
in the hands of a dramatic coach, Gor
don Davis, and a Dramatic Council, and
includes not only acting but preparation
of scenes and experience in stage and
business management.
Grant Corby, '22, president of the
Senior Class, appealed for less laxity on
the part of upperclassmen in observing
the traditions of the University. The
friendly "hello" is a distinct mark of
Stanford, and he urged that both fresh
men and old students remember it. One
of Stanford's latest traditions, the honor
system, was discussed fully by Lloyd
Aubert, '22, chairman of Men's Council.
"The system has worked out success
fully at two universities, Princeton and
the University of Virginia," he said.
"At others it has been enforced only in
name, and not in practice, and that is
a condition which can not exist at Stan
ford. It must be carried out to the
fullest extent of the law or not at all."
The system means tihat every man
and woman in the University is on his
or her honor during examinations.
There is no member of the faculty in
the room and the student is the only
guide of his actions. It is a chancc
where lie must show that he is a true
Stanford man and worthy of trust. "A
man who cheats under the honor system
is the lowest thing there is," said Au
bert. "He is worse than a man who will
bet on a sure proposition, and we have
no place in the University for him."
Roland Kinney, '22, football manager,
asked for the supi>ort of the students
in the bleachers and in the treatment of
visiting teams and rooters. "Stanford
has always been known for her fair
treatment and good sportsmanship, and
this is a reputation we must sustain."
The University is judged by the action
of its members, and Kinney asked that
the students remember at all times to
conduct themselves as gentlemen. He
spoke also of the hospitality of living
groups to visiting teams. A system of
student managers to care for the enter
tainment of visitors has been arranged
and Kinney asked that all students co
operate with these men.
Jack Patrick, '21, captain of the varsity
eleven, was given an enthusiastic greet
ing when he rose to tell his opinion of
the outcome of the big scrap on Novem
ber 19. "If we cut out the razz and jazz,
we will have a better harmony," he said
in speaking of the general student atti
tude. "Right now we're going strong,"
he said, "and we're out to get that gang
across the Bay." The varsity men are
working every afternoon from 3 to 6,
and Patrick urged that all the students
give them their support. He spoke es
pecially to the underclassmen in regard
to turning out during their first years
with the idea of becoming varsity men.
Patrick scoffed at » clipping rumoring
that California would soon consider
U. S. C. a more formidable rival than
Stanford and make her Big Game with
the southern college. "California and
Stanford have a ten-year agreement
which can not be broken, and such ru
mors arc only the work of some over
enthusiastic southern alumni," said Pat
rick. "What we want to do is live, talk,
and be Stanford, and then watch for re
sults."
The Assembly was opened by "Fight
for Stanford," the new bleacher song,
written by C. W. Midgley and sung by
the University Glee Club.

Mary Sprott. '19, left the campus
today, having spent a four-day vaca

tinued. "A few years ago the parlor snake was an object of derision on the
campus, but today that class is increasing. It is manifested in the marked

falling off in the number of men going
out for activities. It's a pure case of
passing the buck, and is not the attitude
of real Stanford men."
Evans appealed directly to the women
students for help in ridding the campus
of the "tea-hound" variety. "The social
attitude and standards are in your
hands," he said, "and we ask you to act
as a committee of five hundred to kill
this 'four hundred' idea."
Mary Mathews, '22, president of Or
ganized Women, spoke briefly on the
women's participation in student activi
ties. The women's own organization
give? them training in student govern
ment and tits them to help in all student
affairs, she said.
"It is only by every underclassman
getting into the game early, that we can
hope to keep up the standard of student
activities," said Wylie Kilpatrick, '23,
editor of the Quad, in speaking on stu
dent interests. No other university has
a better rounded out field of journalism
than Stanford, he pointed out, citing the
Daily Palo Alto, the Quad, and the
monthly magazines, Pictorial, Cardinal,
and Chaparral. There is need for new
material on all of these publications,
and Kilpatrick urged that new men and
women seek out the editors of the spe
cial publication in which they are inter
ested to try out for work. The chances
for participation in dramatics are. many,
said Kilpatrick. The dramatic work is
in the hands of a dramatic coach, Gor
don Davis, and a Dramatic Council, and
includes not only acting but preparation
of scenes and experience in stage and
business management.
Grant Corby, '22, president of the
Senior Class, appealed for less laxity on
the part of upperclassmen in observing
the traditions of the University. The
friendly "hello" is a distinct mark of
Stanford, and he urged that both fresh
men and old students remember it. One
of Stanford's latest traditions, the honor
system, was discussed fully by Lloyd
Aubert, '22, chairman of Men's Council.
"The system has worked out success
fully at two universities, Princeton and
the University of Virginia," he said.
"At others it has been enforced only in
name, and not in practice, and that is
a condition which can not exist at Stan
ford. It must be carried out to the
fullest extent of the law or not at all."
The system means tihat every man
and woman in the University is on his
or her honor during examinations.
There is no member of the faculty in
the room and the student is the only
guide of his actions. It is a chancc
where lie must show that he is a true
Stanford man and worthy of trust. "A
man who cheats under the honor system
is the lowest thing there is," said Au
bert. "He is worse than a man who will
bet on a sure proposition, and we have
no place in the University for him."
Roland Kinney, '22, football manager,
asked for the supi>ort of the students
in the bleachers and in the treatment of
visiting teams and rooters. "Stanford
has always been known for her fair
treatment and good sportsmanship, and
this is a reputation we must sustain."
The University is judged by the action
of its members, and Kinney asked that
the students remember at all times to
conduct themselves as gentlemen. He
spoke also of the hospitality of living
groups to visiting teams. A system of
student managers to care for the enter
tainment of visitors has been arranged
and Kinney asked that all students co
operate with these men.
Jack Patrick, '21, captain of the varsity
eleven, was given an enthusiastic greet
ing when he rose to tell his opinion of
the outcome of the big scrap on Novem
ber 19. "If we cut out the razz and jazz,
we will have a better harmony," he said
in speaking of the general student atti
tude. "Right now we're going strong,"
he said, "and we're out to get that gang
across the Bay." The varsity men are
working every afternoon from 3 to 6,
and Patrick urged that all the students
give them their support. He spoke es
pecially to the underclassmen in regard
to turning out during their first years
with the idea of becoming varsity men.
Patrick scoffed at » clipping rumoring
that California would soon consider
U. S. C. a more formidable rival than
Stanford and make her Big Game with
the southern college. "California and
Stanford have a ten-year agreement
which can not be broken, and such ru
mors arc only the work of some over
enthusiastic southern alumni," said Pat
rick. "What we want to do is live, talk,
and be Stanford, and then watch for re
sults."

Stanford is out to get "thai gang across the Bay," and to show that Stan

was the underlying message giveti to the student body by the seven student
speakers at the Assembly held at 10 o'clock this morning.
"This institution is what We make it." said Dan Evans, "22, president of the
Associated Students, opening the Assembly. "The stadium is a permanent
monument of Stanford spirit and it shows that our alumni are back of us; the
honor system and the abolition of probation show that the faculty is back of us,
and the rest is up to us."
President Evans brought out strongly the need of Stanfprd as a unit and
not as divided into geographical sections. The student body should co-operate
for one compact group and work together for one common end—the progress
of the University and its activities, he pointed out. "We're becoming too so
phisticated and worldly wise and are afraid to be real college men," lie con
tinued. "A few years ago the parlor snake was an object of derision on the

hope to keep up the standard of student
activities," said Wylie Kilpatrick, '23,
editor of the Quad, in speaking on stu
dent interests. No other university has
a better rounded out field of journalism
than Stanford, he pointed out, citing the
Daily Palo Alto, the Quad, and the
monthly magazines, Pictorial, Cardinal,
and Chaparral. There is need for new
material on all of these publications,
and Kilpatrick urged that new men and
women seek out the editors of the spe
cial publication in which they are inter
ested to try out for work. The chances
for participation in dramatics are. many,
said Kilpatrick. The dramatic work is
in the hands of a dramatic coach, Gor
don Davis, and a Dramatic Council, and
includes not only acting but preparation
of scenes and experience in stage and
business management.
Grant Corby, '22, president of the
Senior Class, appealed for less laxity on
the part of upperclassmen in observing
the traditions of the University. The
friendly "hello" is a distinct mark of
Stanford, and he urged that both fresh
men and old students remember it. One
of Stanford's latest traditions, the honor
system, was discussed fully by Lloyd
Aubert, '22, chairman of Men's Council.
"The system has worked out success
fully at two universities, Princeton and
the University of Virginia," he said.
"At others it has been enforced only in
name, and not in practice, and that is
a condition which can not exist at Stan
ford. It must be carried out to the
fullest extent of the law or not at all."
The system means tihat every man
and woman in the University is on his
or her honor during examinations.
There is no member of the faculty in
the room and the student is the only
guide of his actions. It is a chancc
where lie must show that he is a true
Stanford man and worthy of trust. "A
man who cheats under the honor system
is the lowest thing there is," said Au
bert. "He is worse than a man who will
bet on a sure proposition, and we have
no place in the University for him."
Roland Kinney, '22, football manager,
asked for the supi>ort of the students
in the bleachers and in the treatment of
visiting teams and rooters. "Stanford
has always been known for her fair
treatment and good sportsmanship, and
this is a reputation we must sustain."
The University is judged by the action
of its members, and Kinney asked that
the students remember at all times to
conduct themselves as gentlemen. He
spoke also of the hospitality of living
groups to visiting teams. A system of
student managers to care for the enter
tainment of visitors has been arranged
and Kinney asked that all students co
operate with these men.
Jack Patrick, '21, captain of the varsity
eleven, was given an enthusiastic greet
ing when he rose to tell his opinion of
the outcome of the big scrap on Novem
ber 19. "If we cut out the razz and jazz,
we will have a better harmony," he said
in speaking of the general student atti
tude. "Right now we're going strong,"
he said, "and we're out to get that gang
across the Bay." The varsity men are
working every afternoon from 3 to 6,
and Patrick urged that all the students
give them their support. He spoke es
pecially to the underclassmen in regard
to turning out during their first years
with the idea of becoming varsity men.
Patrick scoffed at » clipping rumoring
that California would soon consider
U. S. C. a more formidable rival than
Stanford and make her Big Game with
the southern college. "California and
Stanford have a ten-year agreement
which can not be broken, and such ru
mors arc only the work of some over
enthusiastic southern alumni," said Pat
rick. "What we want to do is live, talk,
and be Stanford, and then watch for re
sults."
The Assembly was opened by "Fight
for Stanford," the new bleacher song,
written by C. W. Midgley and sung by
the University Glee Club.

Stanford is out to get "thai gang across the Bay," and to show that Stan
ford spirit and sportsmanship are permanent fixtures of the University. This
was the underlying message giveti to the student body by the seven student
speakers at the Assembly held at 10 o'clock this morning.
"This institution is what We make it." said Dan Evans, "22, president of the
Associated Students, opening the Assembly. "The stadium is a permanent
monument of Stanford spirit and it shows that our alumni are back of us; the
honor system and the abolition of probation show that the faculty is back of us,
and the rest is up to us."
President Evans brought out strongly the need of Stanfprd as a unit and
not as divided into geographical sections. The student body should co-operate
for one compact group and work together for one common end—the progress
of the University and its activities, he pointed out. "We're becoming too so
phisticated and worldly wise and are afraid to be real college men," lie con
tinued. "A few years ago the parlor snake was an object of derision on the
campus, but today that class is increasing. It is manifested in the marked

falling off in the number of men going
out for activities. It's a pure case of
passing the buck, and is not the attitude
of real Stanford men."
Evans appealed directly to the women
students for help in ridding the campus
of the "tea-hound" variety. "The social
attitude and standards are in your
hands," he said, "and we ask you to act
as a committee of five hundred to kill
this 'four hundred' idea."
Mary Mathews, '22, president of Or
ganized Women, spoke briefly on the
women's participation in student activi
ties. The women's own organization
give? them training in student govern
ment and tits them to help in all student
affairs, she said.
