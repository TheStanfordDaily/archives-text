j rOLO GROUNDS, " t:r »auished this afternoon
Snyder joined the society of the disu». 0 1 victory over
when he batted the New York Giants to.a 2to ■
| the Yankees, in the seventh game of the world s series.
In the seventh inning 40,000 fans sitting under heavy
clouds that threatened rain momentarily clamored for a run
that would break the tie and give the game to the National
League champions. Snyder responded by smashing a double
to center which sent Rawlings over the plate with the run
that gave the game and a 4 to 3 count in the series to the
Giants.
Phil Dougl as, the long, loose-hung mountaineer came in
for an equal share of the glory by pitching a brilliant game
and completely subdued the heavy hitting Yanks. He had
trouble in getting away, however, and in the second inning
the Yanks got to him for their only run. Pipp doubled and
McNally scored him with a single. The Yanks were then
through for the afternoon.
In the seventh inning the American League champions
had a fine opportunity to score with two down. Frank
Baker singled and went to third on another single by Schang.
Carl Mays, usually a good hitter, failed in the pinch and was
a feeble infield out.
The Giants scored their first run in the fourth inning,
when Young singled, stole second and scored on Emil Meu
sel's hit.
The eighth game of the series, tomorrow, is expected to
find Art Nehf, the Giant southpaw star, and Waite Hoyt, the
Brooklyn kid, opposing each other on the mound.
