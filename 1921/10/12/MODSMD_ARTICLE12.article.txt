# CARDINALS TO FACE FAST ELEVEN SATURDAY
## Showing of Olympic Club in Their Battle With Bruins Stamps Them as Dangerous 
### 
With but two more days left for
hard scrimmage, Gene Van Gent and
tlio rest of the Stanford grid coaches,
were today bending every effort to
ward strengthening the Card eleven
for Saturday's clash with the power
ful Olympic Club in San Francisco.
The Cardinal mentors realize they
are up against a difficult situation.
Any team that can display the of
fensive and defensive power that the
winged "O" outfit showed in their
affair with California, two weeks ago,
must be reckoned as, one of the best
teams on the coast.
Whatever points of weakness the
Stanford varsity showed against St.
Mary's, were offset by the fact that
every man was following the ball and
many coaches have expressed the
opinion that the first thing that a
good team must be able to do is to
watch the course of the oval.
Just what kind of a line-up Van
Gent will start against the Olympics
is still problematical, due to the fact
that injuries may shelve some of the
Cards. DeGroot, center, is hardly ex
pected to be able to get into the
game. His place will likely be taken
by Ludeke, who has been playing any
line position except center. "Bud"
Woodward has a strained muscle in
his neck, and may be out of the fray.
Mertz will probably be back in the
game and Art Wilcox who was taken
out of Saturday's game with a bad
knee will undoubtedly be in shape
by Saturday.
Reports from San Francisco today
were to the effect that the Olympic
Club will line up practically the same
as they did against California. Dob
son at full-back, Needles and Williams
at half-backs, and Captain Peterson
at quarter, will comprise the back
field. The Olympic Club line will
probably show as follows: Shelton
and McCoy, ends; Pike and Daly,
tackles; Hainko and Nickelmann,
Guards; and Callison, center.
Lact year's game went to the "O"
Club, 10 to 7. The affair was played
during a rainstorm and Stanford was
twice held for downs within five yards
of a. touchdown during the closing
moments of play.
Tickets lor Saturday's game are
now on sale at Jack Meyers' store in
Encina, Greene's Cigar Store, and at
Crandall's in Palo Alto. Tickets will
also be placed on sale on the Quad
near the Law steps, tomorrow.
Graduate Manager W. D. Fletcher
has announced that student body
cards will not be good for the game.
The admission price will be $1.10.
