# CREW WILL START IN SPRING OF 1923; PROSPECTS HOPEFUL
## 
### 
A meeting of all men interested in
crew was held last night tat the Chi
Psi house, at which prospects for re
viving crew were discussed. Prof.
Mitchell and Dr. Williams of the
Board of Athletic Control, and grad
uate manager William Fletcher, were
also present.
The decision finally reached was
that crew can not he started this
year, but in the spring of 1923 the
sport will probably be put back on a
permanent basis. This will mean that
the members of the freshman crew of
two years ago, who will still be in
the University, will form the nucleus
for the varsity. In this way thero
will not be a total lack of experienced
men, as was feared some time ago
there might be if crew was not re
vived very .soon.
The reason for setting the date in
the spring of 1923 is purely one of a
financial nature. It is estimated that
$15,000 will be required to put the
sport on the footing whjch it should
have, and the stadium and basketball
pavilion will pay for themselves after
a while but not during this year.
Therefore it was thought best to wait
until the financial situation improves
to where it will .not be a burden on
the university to proride the money.
A cheerful feature of the situation
appears in the fact that the city of
Palo Alto may build a road out to a
30-acre tract of land on the bay which
it owns, and which is considered the
best place for crew practice this side
of San Mateo, having a fine open
water estuary. If this road is built,
not only will a better place than
Kedwood be found, but the time taken
in going back and forth will be con
siderably shortened. In the meantime,
interest in crew prospects is being
revived and further developments are
awaited.
