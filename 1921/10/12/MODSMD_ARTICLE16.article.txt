# START THEM RIGHT

Remember when you were a wee youngster and your mother took
you with her to visit the home of a friend?, You sat on the edge of
your seat, trying to look comfortable and interested, but in your own
little mind you knew that you were making a miserable job of it. Then
the kindly lady of the house noticed your predicament, gave you a large
slice of bread with jam, showed you how to play the old Edison phono
graph in the corner, and showed you how to interest and amuse your
self. When it came time to leave you wanted to stay and play with
your newly found toys. You were interested and home and its fa
miliarity had no appeal to you.
Stanford today is in the position of that kindly housewife. We
have received into our midst several hundred mature young people.
They are not here for a short time, we hope, but will be here for four
years. Therefore our task is larger than w r as that of the lady you were
visiting with mother.
Show the newcomers the interesting things which Stanford Uni
versity has to offer. They are many and diverse and there is something
to interest everyone of them so that when they have to leave they will
regret that the four years are gone. Leaders in every activity should
encourage the new students who are trying to break in. They are now
uncomfortable. They know comparatively nothing of the new house in
which they are. Take them in hand and show them the workings of the
different activities. Invite them off the edge of the chair and into the
center of the lloor.
Leaders among the upper classmen should encourage the younger
— ambers of the student body to get into an activity. There is a field
re for every one of them. Once they are interested no further urging
II be necessary. Help them to rub off their discomfort by getting
■m started. If they arc interested in something they will help them
ves. By helping themselves they will help Stanford. By helping
mford they will aid in spreading the prestige of this institution
oughout the land.
