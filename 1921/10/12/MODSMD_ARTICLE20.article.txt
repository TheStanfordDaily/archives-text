# CABBAGES AND THINGS T.I., '23

### 
Aha! The Yellow Peril, agaiu! A
promising young chiropodist has a fine
opening as corrector of the damage
done last evening when Car No. 57
suffered a broken arch, lost a shoe
off the brakes, and encountered diffi
culties when the shoe lodged in the
frog. A corn on one of the wheels
is said to be responsible for the in
jury. The patient will recover.

Maybe the durned thing had fiat
feet,

Reports to the effect that "Roscoe
Arbuckle," turtle and erstwhile pet of
a campus organization, has fled his
bed and board, indicates that tubbing
is dying out. No wet place left for
his morning gambol.
* * *
Flash —Maybe he's in Woodside.
+ * *
Another flash —Maybe he's a reform
ed gambolier.
* * *
Still another —We're rather suspici
ous about that soup we had last night,
anyway. k % Following courses in se
quence, that's one way for the tortoise
to beat the hare.

The above paragraph will be dia
grammed for puzzled parties upon the
presentation of a printed request, ac
companied by a better pun.

Worm Chaser Rorke, Wednesday
conductor, who is to be held respons
ible for most of the below, remarks
that a worse pun is not available.
* * *
On With the Dance
Aggie—Oh dear, my feet are all
wet!
Maggie—Why don't you wear
pumps?

Having chased all the worms out
of the Cabbage Patch, this afternoon,
Wednesday conductor offers this: —

We Bow
Once on a time, not long ago,
Was one with comfort blest.
So tired doing nothnig,
That one must always rest.
But now one weary Cabbageman
Improves the gilded minute;
E'en listens to each lecture
To catch what's funny in it!
* * *
News Item:—Forty odd freshmen are
trying out for the Daily this year.
Will a few normal guys please get
off the proud flesh. Since we're all
writing Cabbages the staff is getting
odd enough.
* * *
Come to think of it, we nearly lost
a football captain during the Saint
Mary's game. Not that the execution
might have some of the
danger, but one tryoutee calls at
tention to the fact that he neatly
dropped over the goal posts.
* * *
Remember to appear in chapel to
morrow, men. Prayers may put Brick
Muller's arm in shape for the Big
one.
♦ * *
But, as he said t othe first bottom,
that'll all come up again later.
* * *
One never can tell until the wash
comes back, anyway.
* * *
Logic one figured uot today that
brutes are never responsible. That
ain't right, fellers. What'll happen
to all the Rover jokes?
Very likely they'll go to the dogs,
Jerome? Right. And now, Oscar, tell
the lady where the Bookstore's origin
al African Ink Drinking Camel has
gone. As a pen ad it sure is Dunn.

They won't be mad, though, if the
culprit gets all his Christmas cards
there. He might as well get them
there as buy them somewhere else.
* * *
Since so much has fallen already It
is only fair to mention Roble Bridge.
A1 E. Roth, Comptroller of this here
Univ., says that the trees on which
it was built are rotten. 'Sail right
bridge, there's something rotten In
Denmark, too.
♦ * *
However, just because it's down, it's
never out, The Stadium will hold
several times as many at once as the
total record of the old tim(b)ers can
boast. For statistics, see yesterday's.
♦ * ♦
Another tit bit. After the informa
tion that the campus theatre has a
"green room" and it is a place to talk
the drama over, comes the news that
the name is to be changed. Tell them,
"I'll meet you in the Brown Room"
in the future.
♦ * *
That ought to be information. In
lock-step formation.
* ♦ *
Readers and low-brows. Don't get
the impression from our gang boss
that we have no comebacks to such
year-before-last wit as that he men
tions our hat with. We can print it
lest the Morgenthalers quit on us. As
the chief shoveller is wont to say, the
worm will turn —when he has busted
out on the other side.
