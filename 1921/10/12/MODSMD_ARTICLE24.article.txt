# Y. M. C. A. CABINET HOLDS FIRST MEETING
## 
### 
A concentrated drive for membership
is being carried on by the Y. VV. C. A.,
in an effort to enroll every woman on
the campus in its ranks. The drive,
under the supervision of Mary Mathews,
'22, is being carried up the Row by a
committee of five, each one canvassing
two houses. Roble Hall has almost
reached the 100 per cent mark, and it is
expected that the entire campus will do
the same.
