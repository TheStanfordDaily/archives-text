# INTERIMS SWIM TO START NEW SEASON
## 
### 
The 1921 swimming season will be
officially opened on October 20, when
representatives from the four classes
will compete in what promises to be
one of the fastest inter-class meets
ever held. At the present time it is
more or less of a toss-up as J.o which
class will be ahead after the last
event is held.
Those who witness the meet will
have the opportunity of seeing Clar
ence Pinkston, '22, world's champion
i diver, in actiou. Pinkston is declared
to in even better form than when he
appeared at Stanford last spring in
an exhibition.
The sprints should provide keen
competition, with Austin, '23, and
Drake, '22, furnishing most of the ex
citement. In the 50-yard event Mac-
I
conel, '23, may upset the dope and
come out ahead, and Klebahn, '25,
who hails from Honolulu, will also be
among those present at the finish.
The sophomores are depending on
Ernie Greppin, to make some points
for them in the 220.
Fletcher, '24, and Stern, '22, seem
to be the favorites in the 66-yard
back-stroke, although Don Young, a
freshman, is showing plenty of prom
ise. In the breast-stroke, Charlie
Fletcher looks to be good for a win,
with Sclimeider, his classmate, and
Wilbur, '22, right on his heels.
Withe, '24, and Snedden, '23, appear
to be the class of the divers outside
of Pinkston. The seniors are strong
in the plunge for distance, with Miller
and Owenby enterted, but Landis,
'23, and Rising, '25, will furish them
with plenty of competition.
