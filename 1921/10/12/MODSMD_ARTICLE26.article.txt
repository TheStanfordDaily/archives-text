The cabinet of the local Y. M. C. A.
organization held its first regular meet
ing of the year last night in the offices
in the Men's Union, and disposed of im
portant business in regard to plans for
this and the coming quarters.
It was decided to hold a "stag" at the
earliest possible moment, and all de
tails were left up to Doug McKinnon,
chairman of the social committee. This
"stag" will probably be arranged before
mid-term examinations start.
Reports from the various heads of
committees were heard. It was decided
to include in future cabinet meetings
the chairmen of all active committees.
The membership campaign was reported
as coming along satisfactorily. Plans
for raising funds, both for the local or
ganization and for outside relief work,
were talked over and tentative dates set
for starting the campaigns in the au
tumn, winter, and spring quarters. B.
I"'. Haley resigned from the position of
secretary and the nomination of his suc
cessor Was left up to the proper com
mittee.
