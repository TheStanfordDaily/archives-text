# BRILLIANT PROSPECTS AHEAD OF GLEE CLUB
## 
### 
1 he prospects for this year's activities
in the Glee Club are more than promis
ing, according to the president, Myron
Higby, 011 account of the splendid ma
terial which has shown up at the try
outs. The number is unusually large,
tliere being up to last night over a hun
dred tryoutees, and this number will be
increased at the next tryout to be held
Wednesday afternoon from 4 to 6 for
the rest of the candidates. On this ac
count the present list of successful men
is being withheld and will appear in the
Daily Palo Alto Thursday.
Manager Bradley Wvatt is already
arranging for the financing of this year's
tour which, we are assured by the di
rector. Warren B. Allen, will rank with
the trips taken by the biggest Glee Clubs,
and furthermore will be 011 a par with
the European trip taken recently by the
Harvard Club.
The Club is particularly fortunate this
year in again having with them some
talent of last year in the following men:
Marsden Argall, who sang in "Faust"
and also starred with the Club last year
in the California Theatre success in San
Francisco. Marsden's baritone is well
known and vastly appreciated by those
who have heard him. Also Marshall
Monroe of San Diego, a wonderful lyric
tenor, will again sing with the Club.
The new program will be of the best
and everyone who can sing is urged to
attend the last tryout.
