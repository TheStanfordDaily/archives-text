# BRITISH INDIA TO PROCURE HOME RULE
## Professor E. C. Horne Predicts a Complete Home-Rule Act for British India People 
### 
"British: India is, at the present time,
being given her rights one by one until
in the course of a few years the Indian
people will enjoy complete home rule
such as is given to Canada and Eng
land's colonies in South Africa," said
Professor E. C. Home last evening in
his lecture on "The Political Reforms
and Political Problems of British In
dia."
"Political changes of a remarkable
character date from the beginning o.f
the year 1921. If these had come at any
other time they would be noticed all
over the world, but on account of the
political changes in all other parts of
the globe, these have passed almost un

Professor Iluriic explained -hu\V these
reforms in the Indian government grew

contributed large numbers of men who
were sent to the theaters of war in
Europe, and raised large sums of money
for the support of the army and be

was recognized that India would have
to be given more liberties, and in the
middle of August, 1917, an official an

on democratic principles. Great Britain
is now carrying out that promise.
"The former policy of government
was to take the leaders of the Indian
people into ever closer partnership with
the British, but it was evident that the
British would always be the dominant
factor. According to the new policy,
Great Britain is handing over, by in
stallments, the government to the peo
ple. There will be a continual and grad
ual withdrawal of British influence until
India shall have complete home rule."
Professor Home then took up the re
forms themselves. India consists of
eight great provinces which have been
made into large administrative units as
a basis of the foundation for. popular
government. They are not dependent
on the revenues of the central govern
ment. They have their own legislature.
But over them all is the central govern
ment of India.
"The second reform," he continued,
"is the foundation of a popular elec
torate. Already over six million people
have been enfranchised and a local par-
