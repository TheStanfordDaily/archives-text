# BRITISH INDIA TO PROCURE HOME RULE
## Professor E. C. Horne Predicts a Complete Home-Rule Act for British India People 
### 
"British: India is, at the present time,
being given her rights one by one until
in the course of a few years the Indian
people will enjoy complete home rule
such as is given to Canada and Eng
land's colonies in South Africa," said
Professor E. C. Home last evening in
his lecture on "The Political Reforms
and Political Problems of British In
dia."
"Political changes of a remarkable
character date from the beginning o.f
the year 1921. If these had come at any
other time they would be noticed all
over the world, but on account of the
political changes in all other parts of
the globe, these have passed almost un
noticed."
Professor Iluriic explained -hu\V these
reforms in the Indian government grew
directly out of the Great War. India
contributed large numbers of men who
were sent to the theaters of war in
Europe, and raised large sums of money
for the support of the army and be
sides made a free loan to the British
exchequer of five hundred million dol
lars. From the beginning of the war it
was recognized that India would have
to be given more liberties, and in the
middle of August, 1917, an official an
nouncement was made in the House of
Commons which promised India a re
sponsible democratic government based
on democratic principles. Great Britain
is now carrying out that promise.
"The former policy of government
was to take the leaders of the Indian
people into ever closer partnership with
the British, but it was evident that the
British would always be the dominant
factor. According to the new policy,
Great Britain is handing over, by in
stallments, the government to the peo
ple. There will be a continual and grad
ual withdrawal of British influence until
India shall have complete home rule."
Professor Home then took up the re
forms themselves. India consists of
eight great provinces which have been
made into large administrative units as
a basis of the foundation for. popular
government. They are not dependent
on the revenues of the central govern
ment. They have their own legislature.
But over them all is the central govern
ment of India.
"The second reform," he continued,
"is the foundation of a popular elec
torate. Already over six million people
have been enfranchised and a local par-
liament started. Eacli province lias two
houses of legislature, corresponding to
our Senate and House of Representa
tives. The real departure in this is that
the men who belong to these bodies are
responsible, not to the British govern
ment, but to the Tndian people who
elected them to their offices. Above
these two bodies there is ah executive
council consisting of three members:
two British officers and one Indian pub
lic man. In a short time one of the
English officers will retire and his place
will not be filled. This executive coun
cil has charge of the administration of
justice and the law courts. The two
legislative bodies have under their super
vision education in all its branches, the
excise revenue, public health and public
improvements, agricultural and indus
trial research and development, and
many other branches. This is a rela
tively limited field of provincial govern
ment, but as the people learn to exer
cise their rights, develop a sense of re
sponsibility, and an ability to stand
alone, one by one their rights will be
turned over until the present diarchy
will he turned over to the Indians."
"The roforms which have been intro
duced," declared Professor Horne,
"have already caused a definite split in
the political parties of India. One party
is in favor of slow development along
constitutional lines, while the other, led
by Mr. Gandhi, is clamoring for com
plete home rule immediately.
"The second big problem j* reconciling
the divergent racial interests. 11l
Canada and South Africa these were
overcome by granting freedom to those
states, and T am confident that the same
result will ensue in India. A gradual
removal of these discriminations is now
being made.
"India," concluded Professor Horne,
"is being recognized by the nations of
the world, and on account of this can
make her voice heard."

will he turned over to the Indians."
"The roforms which have been intro
duced," declared Professor Horne,
"have already caused a definite split in
the political parties of India. One party
is in favor of slow development along
constitutional lines, while the other, led
by Mr. Gandhi, is clamoring for com

Canada and South Africa these were
overcome by granting freedom to those
states, and T am confident that the same
result will ensue in India. A gradual
removal of these discriminations is now
being made.
"India," concluded Professor Horne,
"is being recognized by the nations of
the world, and on account of this can
make her voice heard."
"British: India is, at the present time,
being given her rights one by one until
in the course of a few years the Indian
people will enjoy complete home rule
such as is given to Canada and Eng
land's colonies in South Africa," said
Professor E. C. Home last evening in
his lecture on "The Political Reforms
and Political Problems of British In
dia."
"Political changes of a remarkable
character date from the beginning o.f
the year 1921. If these had come at any
other time they would be noticed all
over the world, but on account of the
political changes in all other parts of
the globe, these have passed almost un
noticed."
Professor Iluriic explained -hu\V these
reforms in the Indian government grew
directly out of the Great War. India
contributed large numbers of men who
were sent to the theaters of war in
Europe, and raised large sums of money
for the support of the army and be
sides made a free loan to the British
exchequer of five hundred million dol
lars. From the beginning of the war it
was recognized that India would have
to be given more liberties, and in the
middle of August, 1917, an official an
nouncement was made in the House of
Commons which promised India a re
sponsible democratic government based
on democratic principles. Great Britain
is now carrying out that promise.
"The former policy of government
was to take the leaders of the Indian
people into ever closer partnership with
the British, but it was evident that the
British would always be the dominant
factor. According to the new policy,
Great Britain is handing over, by in
stallments, the government to the peo
ple. There will be a continual and grad
ual withdrawal of British influence until
India shall have complete home rule."
Professor Home then took up the re
forms themselves. India consists of
eight great provinces which have been
made into large administrative units as
a basis of the foundation for. popular
government. They are not dependent
on the revenues of the central govern
ment. They have their own legislature.
But over them all is the central govern
ment of India.
"The second reform," he continued,
"is the foundation of a popular elec
torate. Already over six million people
have been enfranchised and a local par-
liament started. Eacli province lias two
houses of legislature, corresponding to
our Senate and House of Representa
tives. The real departure in this is that
the men who belong to these bodies are
responsible, not to the British govern
ment, but to the Tndian people who
elected them to their offices. Above
these two bodies there is ah executive
council consisting of three members:
two British officers and one Indian pub
lic man. In a short time one of the
English officers will retire and his place
will not be filled. This executive coun
cil has charge of the administration of
justice and the law courts. The two
legislative bodies have under their super
vision education in all its branches, the
excise revenue, public health and public
improvements, agricultural and indus
trial research and development, and
many other branches. This is a rela
