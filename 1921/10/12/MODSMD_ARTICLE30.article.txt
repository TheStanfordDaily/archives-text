# DR. TAYLOR SPEAKS TONIGHT ON RELIEF WORK IN AUSTRIA
## 
### 
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, eminent food
specialist and veteran of Hoover's Euro
pean campaign, will deliver a lecture to
night in the Little Theatre at 7:30 on
"The Work of the American Relief Ad
ministration in Austria." The lecture is
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
Dr. Taylor is in charge of the Food
Institute which is now permanently lo
cated here on the campus and is already
starting on its extensive plans for field
work in all sections of this and other
countries to map out the food problem
of the world. He worked with Dr.
Gregory under Hoover in the European
Relief which was carried on after the
armistice was signed.
His special position was to travel ex
tensively throughout the various coun
tries where starvation ranged unchecked
and to report as to where aid was
needed most and how it could best be
given. His extensive traveling and in
timate contact with the people gave him
a unique insight into conditions exist
ing there, and in his talk tonight he will
show what the relief brought to the
starving Austrians did to save them.
This work was started immediately
after the signing of the armistice, and
is still going on at the present time.
Although A-ustria was but part of the
area fed by the American Relief, con
ditions there were typical of what ex
isted over a larger area, and Dr. Tay
lor's remarks will be in reference to
this particular section. Everyone is in
vited to attend, admission being free
to all.
This is the first of a series of ad
dresses by prominent speakers arranged
by the World Problems Forum of the
Y. M. C. A.
