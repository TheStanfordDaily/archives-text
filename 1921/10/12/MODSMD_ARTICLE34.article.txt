# CHURCHMEN'S LEAGUE TO HOLD RECEPTIONS
## 
### 
Stanford students and members of the
faculty are to he guests of honor at re
ceptions given by the various churches
of Palo Alto under the auspices of the
recently formed United Churchmen's
League, Friday evening. Students are
invited to attend the receptions at the
church of their preference on that eve
ning, or if they have none, to attend any
of the receptions.
The United Churchmen's League, in
which all of the churches are repre
sented, is an organization devoted to the
service to the religious needs of the
community. Chaplain D. C. Gardner de
livered the initial lecture of a series to
be given before the league on "The Re
ligious Policy of Stanford University,"
last Saturday evening at the Congrega
tional Church in Palo Alto.
Dr. Gardner told of the methods now
being used in many of the universities
to strengthen the religious phase of
college life, and outlined some of those
that might be put into effect at Stan
ford.
A large part of the talk was devoted
by the chaplain to discussing the reasons
why college students generally concern
themselves so little with religious work.
The answer, he thought, lay in the free
dom which is new to many of them
when they enter the University.
