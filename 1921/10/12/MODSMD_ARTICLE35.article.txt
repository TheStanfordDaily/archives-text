# COAST TEAMS TO PLAY WATER POLO LEAGUE
## 
### 
Under the direction of Coach Ernie
Brandsten, tilings arc fast getting in
shape for a successful season in water
polo. Almost all of last year's team
have returned, and with the freshman
prospects there will be no lack of ma
terial for a good team in the water
sport.
The California Water Polo Associa
tion is to hold a meeting in San Fran
cisco tonight at which plans will be dis
cussed for the formation of a water
polo league. If all goes well, Stanford
will probably enter a team in the league,
and games will be played once a week.
Those who are slated to be in the pro
posed league are the Neptunes, the
Sutro Aquatics, Idora Park, the Olym
pic Seconds, Dolphins, California, and
Stanford.
