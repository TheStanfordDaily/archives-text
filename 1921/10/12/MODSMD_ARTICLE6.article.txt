star, who has been working with Coach
Seay for several weeks, is in charge of
the backfield, and with Cuddeback, How
ard, Gilliland, and Dennis, gradually
molding into a smooth-working machine,
the dope is that the Babes will annex
some long yardage to tneir credit in the
coming contest.
Bob Cravens, '23, varsity man who is
out of the game this year because of
injuries received last season, is de
veloping the Freshman line and each
day sees it round into better shape.
The Stockton aggregation is doped
to be fast and a victory over them will
raise the standing of Seay's squad in the
eyes of local dopesters. In last Satur
day's games the Freshmen played with
a snap and vim which was encouraging,
and with a general tightening in de
fensive and offensive play they will be
able to put on an entirely different per
formance. Their defense showed weak
ness on overhead plays and on the of
fense their interference was loose, with
a consequent lack of gains.
The Freshman squad is one of the
largest on record and Seay has made a
cut to enable the coaches to put all their
time on the men who have proved them
selves capablc of first string perform
ance. The men still wearing the striped
jerseys arc: Barnes, Carey, Cook, Cud
deback, Driscoll, Dennis, Dale, Dickey,
Fuller, Gilliland, Harman, Hooper,
