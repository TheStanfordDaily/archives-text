### 
Another professor, Lionel Remond
Lenox, of the Department of Chemistry,
iKis " " iade a Sift of $600 to the Univer
sity. The University authorities have
established the Lionel Remond Lenox
Fellowship in Chemistry for the cur-
rent academic year. Professor Lenox
has set no limitations with regard to the
fellowship except that it is for aiding
an advanced student of demonstrated
ability, who has been in residence at
Stanford fur at least one year, in carry
ing on research work in chemistry.
The Lenox Fellowship has been
awarded this year to Robert John Cross,
who graduated from the Department of
Chemistry at Stanford in 1911 and re
lumed for graduate work in 1919. For
the last two years Cross has been the
holder of the Sperry Flour Company

receive his degree of Ph.D. at the end
of this year.
Stanford has a rather remarkable dis
tinction in the number of faculty men
who have established fellowships to aid
advanced students in subjects in which
they are particularly interested. Pro
fessor E. P. Cubberley, Dean of the
School of Education, has this year re
newed the gift of $250 which he has for
several years annually contributed to the
University, toward h teaching fellow
ship in School Administration. The
University duplicates this amount, mak
ing a total fellowship of $500.
Similarly, Professor L. M. Terman,
of the School of Education, has renewed
his annual contribution of $250 toward
a research assistant for the study of
gifted children. This sum likewise the
University raises to $500 from its own
funds.
Professor Theodore J. Hoover, head
of the Department of Mining, last year
established a fellowship in mining
amounting to $600 a year. The holder
of that fellowship this year is Charles
Doble.
Several faculty members have con
tributed additional scholarships to en
able worthy undergraduate students to
pursue work at Stanford. Among such
scholarships now in force are those es
tablished by Professor Payson J. Treat,
of the History Department, J. E. Mc-
Dowell, Academic Secretary of the Uni
versity, and Miss Gertrude Gardiner,
Matron of Roble Hall, the women's
dormitory.
