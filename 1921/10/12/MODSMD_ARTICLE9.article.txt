# HORATIUS PAGED BY RESIDENTS OF ROBLE
## 
### 
"The old Roble bridge must fall,"
quoth Comptroller Roth, most uncon
cerned yesterday. But today, when
the Roble co-eds saujntered from the
hall and saw the old relic being liter
ally torn to pieces by uncouth work
men, a yell was let out that would
have been more than pleasing to Yell
Leader Connolly, had it been a more
opportune time. That was not all,
these angry co-eds fell on Comptroller
Roth and made him answer for his
rashness. "Life or Death," they said.
"Bridge, of course," Roth up and said.
So once more old Roble Bridge was
saved by its trusty guardians. He
promised the bridge would be repair
ed at once.
