I Announces its four concerts for the coming season
as follows:

I Piastre, violinist, and Alfred Mirovich, pianist.
| (2) Saturday evening, December 17, 1921. The

| Helen Stanley, soprano.
§ (4) Thursday evening, February 9, 1922. Reinald
| Werrenrath, baritone.
I The object of the association, now entering its tenth
$ year, is to provide programs by some of the best artists
J] who visit San Francisco each season, at a popular price
§ and in our own Assembly Hall. Membership dues are
1 $5 a year, entitling the subscriber to two tickets for
| each of the four concerts, or 62Yl cents a ticket. Make
| cheques payable to the Peninsula Musical Association.
Because of unavoidable delays in sending out the
| preliminary notices this season, the limit for receiving
§j memberships will be extended to October 20, instead
I of October 15, as usual. Intending subscribers are,
I however, warned against delaying, as the entire house
I was sold out last season, and late subscribers were
| obliged to choose between having their cheques re-
I turned or accepting those side balcony seats which are
I not allotted to regular subscribers.
For the convenience of campus residents, subsenp-
I tions will be received and information furnished by the
I Stanford Bookstore; or applications may be made di
-1 rectly to the Secretary,
