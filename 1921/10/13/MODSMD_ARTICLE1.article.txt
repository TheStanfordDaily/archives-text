POLO GROUNDS, NEW YORK, Oct. 13.—John Mc-
Graw's Giants became the baseball monarchs of the universe
here this afternoon, when they defeated the New York Yanks,
1-0, in the Bth and decisive game of the World's Series.
Roger Peckinpaugh, the Gibraltar of the Yankee infield, fell
down in the first inning and paved the way for the Giants'
only run. Waite Hoyt, the Brooklyn youth, was jointly
responsible for the victory of the Giants. Hoyt put the
winning run on the bases when he walked Bancroft. Peck
then mussed up Kelly's grounder and Bancroft was over the
plate with the run.
Arthur Nehf,, twice defeated in the series, came back and
pitched a brilliant game. He wabbled several times but was
saved by the brilliant work of his inner defense. The great

Babe Ruth, with his arm swollen to
twice its normal size, disobeyed the
orders of his doctors and went in a
pinch hitter in the ninth inning, try
ing to ward off what then looked like
certain defeat. The Swat King failed
and went out an easy grounder.
The Yanks had their big chance in
the fourth. With 2 down, Pipp and
Ward singled and Nehf, losing con
trol momentarily, walked Baker, filling
the bases. Schang came up and drove
a long fly which Burns pulled in for a
fine catch. Rawlings' great work at
2nd and at bat and the work of Burns
in the outfield were features of the
playing of the Gians. Cold weather
made the crowd a big disappointment,
as there were not more than 20,000
in the stands.
