# START REHEARSALS FOR FIRST ACT OF "TAILOR-MADE MAN"
## 
### 
Rehearsals on the "Tailor Made Man''
are at last under way. Coach Gordon
Davis today expressed great satisfaction
as to the progress of the lirst act, which
is the only one available in parts so far
and believes that this cast is one of the
best adapted to be found on the campus.
Everything is being pushed ahead in an
attempt to stage the show on the 28tli.
The first act is in the tailor shop
where Huber manfully keeps people
from dropping away from the impres
sion that there is no other boss, even
though daughter Tanya is around a lot.
Cecil Morris is getting over exception
ally well in this blustering, assertive role
of the German tailor. He has a strong
voice and an accent which is pleasantly
natural.
Les Seili is showing mid-season form
already, putting over the well-known
finish better than three quarts of O-
Cedar could even hope to. His part
calls for tlie suggestion of light strug
gling through a mist, misunderstood ex
cellence, the nobility of self sustaining
moral courage and French phrases.
Nevertheless, Huber hired him as a
I tailor and nobility is forced to struggle
on through torment, which is but to be
expected in tlie lirst act.
Tanya, played by Dorothy Woodhead,
is sweet, musical and everything else
tlie contract calls for, in spite of the
horrible outlook ahead. It is the doctor
to whom she is betrothed and as Tanya
points out, there is not much hope for
a well dressed maid to he happy with
an author of "great" hooks. T. H. Ken
nedy is tlie doctor, and aside from his
perpetual grouch he lias a very had ac
cent. but let Tanya worry about that.
Tonight the fourth act will he re
hearsed and Davis announces that he
wants to see everyone at 7 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall.
