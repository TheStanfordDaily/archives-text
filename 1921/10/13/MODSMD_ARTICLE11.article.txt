# Fierce Flames Fought By Fearless Firemen; Bum Bed Badly Burned
## 
### 
Nocturnal whisperings. Uneasy slum
ber. Smoke, yes bitter acrid smoke
issuing from the under sides of the
downy, uh huh, the downy excelsior
(not that famed by the youth who bore
mid snow and ice), but of a couch (sec
bed). More uneasy slumber punctuated
by unconscious protests against the tor
ridity of the environs. Scene two. Sud
den awakening of leading man in grim
tragedy of conflagration, immediately
followed by exceeding flagging from
there to hence ala bare foot boy with
Pa Jah Ma.
Calls for reinforcements and excited
argument on what is best action in time
of crisis, while near-sighted lad lights
heroically to find the door leading to
safety and cooler climbs. Sudden ap
pearance of water from regions of the
culinary emperor and whitelivered with
drawal on part of demon fire. Scene
three. Participation by all hands in
"the innocent stuff that knits up ravelled
sleeves of care," etc. Sounds gradually
change from sawing of pine to hard
wood with nails therein.
Scene four. Sudden burst of consum
ing flame. Exhausted firemen leap again
to their posts (three porch and erne
hitching), and direct activity of chief,
who plays broken hose on rapidly di
minishing bedroom appurtenance. Fire
wanes, then dyes, red. redder, black.
Cheers for chief who is now aground in
mud. Expletives. More of same. Shower.
End. Place of action: Beta house. Time,
2:15 this a. in.
