# CARDINAL TOY SQUAD TO TRAVEL
## Extensive Canadian Journey is Promised Stanford Team During Christmas Holidays 
### 
Stanford's Rugby team will make
an extensive tour of the Canadian pro
vinces during the Christmas holidays,
representing the Cardinal as far east
as Montreal, according to plans an
nounced today.
It is the intention to have a com
plete team with substitutes leave for
British Columbia, on December 21.
Three games are scheduled with the
University of Vancouver, which has
one of the crack rugby squads of the
Northwest. A match is to be played
against the Victoria team on New
Year's Day, and from there the team
will jump to the East. While the
schedule is not yet completely filled
out, it is proposed that Stanford meet
the University of Toronto, on January
5, and play McGill University of
Montreal, on January 7.
All men not out for American foot
ball and who wish to go out inform
ally for rugby will be given the op
portunity to do so. While the rugby
season does not officially start until
after the Big Game, on November 19,
it is hoped to get a line on some of
the material for the team before that
time. Practice will be held on the
old rugby field between the Embarca
dero and the track on Mondays, Wed
nesdays, and Fridays, and on the polo
field on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A
circle "S" of the first class will be
awarded those making the team.
Communications have been opened
with the English Rugby Union in re
gard to a proposed tour of the Stan
ford Rugby team throughout the
British Isles. Such a trip will be im
possible this year, but an agreement
may be reached for the winter of 1922-
23. In this event, an entire quarter
will be taken to make the trip.
Rugby, formerly sport of supreme
interest at Stanford, is expected to
receive a big impetus through the
opening of the numerous opportunities
for outside contests.
