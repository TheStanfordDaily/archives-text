# VARSITY LOOKS GOOD IN FRACAS WITH FRESHMEN
## Card Line-up Problematical For Olympic Club Game as Many are on Injured List 
### 
When the Stanford varsity lines up
against the Olympic Club, at Ewing
Field, in San Francisco, Saturday aft
ernoon, it will be the first time since
1916, that a Cardinal team has per
formed in the big city.
Five years ago Stanford and Santa
Clara played their big game at Ewing
Field. That was when both universi
ties were playing rugby.
Van Gent's team looked much better
last night than they did the first time
that they scrimmaged with the fresh
men last week. The varsity took the
ball over for four touchdowns, despite
the fact that "Dud" DeGroot was on
the sidelines wrapped up in a big
sweater, and "Shorty" Mertz, Charley
Helser, Captain Patrick, "Bud" Wood
ward and Art Wilcox were all out of
the fracas.
The Card coaches sent every man
011 the first varsity into the scrim
mage with the exception of those 011
the injured list.
It is practically certain that. De-
Groot, whose work against the St.
Mary's outfit last Saturday, stamped
him as the logical successor to the
famous "Swede" Righter in the center
of the line, is out of the Olympic Club
encounter. He has three broken ribs.
Fred Ludeke will undoubtedly take
his place. The big fellow worked at
center last night and time after time
broke through the freshman line and
smeared the man carrying the ball for
substantial losses.
It is possible, however, that both Wil
cox and Woodward will be ready for
Saturday's contest. Helser wasn't
even out in suit last night and is prob
ably out of the game. He has been
ill and also has an injured rib. Andy
Smith isn't the only grid mentor who
is having his hospital troubles. Gene
Van Gent can vouch for that state
ment.
"Red" Betts started at guard last
night and looked good for the time
that he was in. He and Bob Stice will
probably starts at the guards with
"Scotchy" Campbell ready to go in
at any time. Harley Carter and Joe
Douglas will probably open up at
tackles with Dick Pershing, "Swede"
Larson and "Kewp" Sproull on hands
for the ends. Mertz hardly looks to
be in shape to play Saturday.
Bob Shlaudeman is expected to
start at quarter with the rest of the
backfield, except Doughty, at half,
problematical. Patrick, however, will
probably be in shape to go into the
fray at full and Wilcox's knee is de
cidedly improved so that he looks due
to start at half.
Bob Evans, coach of the Card team
that played the famous game against
California in 1919, appeared on the
field last night and was quickly recog
nized by the fans. He got a big hand.
The Stanford-Olympic game will be
called at 3 o'clock.
