# THE 						BLEACHER COMEBACK
## 
### 
Possibly the largest number of students who ever turned out for a
bleacher rally were in the stands yesterday afternoon when Yell Leader
Connolly led out his army of ambitious arm-wavers for inspection. The
spirit in evidence during the rally yesterday indicates that the performance
of the bleacherites during last Saturday's contest should be forgotten en
tirely. Yesterday the gang was all there, both physically and vocally.
With the first bleacher rally as a starting point Stanford students will
now set to work to make the bleacher stunts for the Big Game the best
yet, through the medium of weekly bleacher rallies. Two assistants were
chosen to assist Yell Leader Connolly and the students deserve com
mendation for the wisdom of their selection. Yesterday's election came
closer to being one in which strict merit was the only motive involved in
naming the candidates than any election held on the campus during the
life of the present university generation.
The student body has done its part in naming two assistants and has
signified its willingness to turn out for yell practice, whenever it is wanted.
That places the issue squarely up to the Yell Leader and his assistants.
Upon them will depend the splendor and effectiveness of the bleacher
display in the Stanford bowl on November 19. Their work is cut out for
them and they have the whole-souled backing of the students.
However, the work of the student body does not end with the first
rally and the naming of the two assistant yell leaders. Response to every
call for yell practice by every member is an absolute necessity if the
massed cheering of Stanford University is to measure up to the high
standard set in last year's athletic contests.
