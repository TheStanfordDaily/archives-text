# A 						CHALLENGE

### 
How many Stanford students will be parked in Ewing Field bleachers
when Coach Van Gent's Cardinal Varsity trots out to play the Olympic
Club gridders next Saturday? That is not only a question; it is a chal
lenge.
The Olympic Club is the leading athletic organization of San Fran
cisco. Every sporting enthusiast who can get the afternoon off, and most
of them do now, will be on hand to see their pride, the Post Street team,
take a fall or two out of the college boys from down the Peninsula.
Their cheering will not be organized but there will be a terrific amount of
free-lance rooting for the encouragement of the Olympics.
Stanford is given a chance to support its team and demonstrate the
famous Stanford spirit by filling several sections of the Ewing Field
stands and putting on an exhibition of organized cheering. The first
reason, the support of the Cardinal fighting football men, is reason enough
for every student who possibly can to make the journey to the metropolis.
The second reason evolves into a point of honor. We are duty bound to
turn out and demonstrate to the outside world, or as much of it as will
jam its way into Ewing Field, that Stanford stands firmly behind its foot
ball men.
