# BABES SET FOR STOCKTON GAME
## Freshman Line-up Intact For Saturday's Battle; Yearlings Good Against Varsity 
### 
Yesterday afternocJh Coach Seay sent
his charges against the Varsity squad in
a scrimmage that lasted throughout the
bleacher rally. Although the Varsity
line-up was continually being changed
by Coach Van Gent and his staff, the
rooters were enabled to get their first
real impression of the strength of the
Babe team as compared with the Varsity.
Coacli Seay sent his first string eleven
into the scrimmage but before the end
of the affair, was experimenting with
both his line and backfield, using a num
ber of substitutions. The freshmen line
is exceptionally heavy this year and with
a little teamwork should develop into
one of the best ever produced by a
Cardinal first-year team. It is also well
balanced, both in weight and strength.
Shipke, who has been playing at left
tackle for the Babes, was a star in the
scrimmage yesterday afternoon. The big
fellow is fast on his feet and charges
well. More than once he broke through
Coach Canning's line yesterday to spill
the Varsity for a loss, causing much
comment in the bleachers. Shipke should
be a very valuable asset to Stanford's
first squad next year.
Van Hook plays a steady game at cen
ter for Coach Seay, while Janssen ap
pears to be a mainstay at the end
position. Janssen has also been used to
do some of the kicking and lie was called
back to boot the ball several times yes
terday when the freshmen were forced
to kick. Dole is another man who has
proven to be one of the best linemen on
the first-year squad. Dole plays at right
tackle and although not flashy, is one
of the steadiest men on the team.
Saturday morning the Cardinal Babes
will face the Stockton high school
eleven on the Stanford turf. The game
promises to be one of the best of the
freshmen season as the Stockton aggre
gation are touted to be one of the best
in the bay region.
