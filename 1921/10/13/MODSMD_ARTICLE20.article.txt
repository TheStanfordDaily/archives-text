## 
### 
Dr. A. D. Browne, medical advisor
of the Men's Physical Education De
partment, states that all upper classmen
as well as members of the lower division
are required by university ruling to take
the physical examination now being
given in the medical office at Encina
Gymnasium. The hours during which
the examination may be taken are from
9 until 12, and from 2 until 6.
Twenty-five courses in physical edu
cation are being offered this year by the
department. These courses cover thor
oughly the physical training field. Dur
ing the summer most of them were
given and were attended by athletic
coaches from high schools and univer
sities throughout the West. Due to this
opportunity for instruction here at Stan
ford the majority of coaches expressed
their appreciation of the university and
went away as staunch boosters of the
Cardinal.
Following are some of the courses:
Fall term â€”Hygiene, Ed, Psychology,
Soccer, Handball, Tennis, Volleyball,
Boxing, Advanced Swimming, Track
and Field Athletics, and Practice Teach
ing. The winter term offers in addi
tion: Aid to Injured, Applied Anatomy,
Gymnastic Drills, Basketball, and Theory
of Teaching. The spring term gives:
Methods of Instruction, Nature and
Function of Play, Developmental Ath
letics for Secondary Schools, Hygiene
of the School Child, Baseball, and
