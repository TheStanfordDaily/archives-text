# CABBAGES AND THINGS
## 
### 
? T.1., '23 ?
We have been cautioned by a critic,
when we wish to speak, to "say it with
Cabbages."
* * *
That's a handicap. Someone else
will get all the corned beef.
* * *
The Berkeley rooters who sit in the
lower seats the day of the Big Battle
and hear "We're going to bury you,
California," can't say they didn't have
fair warning if 1906 repeats itself.

Hie—Gotta snapoo name for my
new brew.
Hank—Whazzat?
Hie—Cardinal. Full o' spirits yuh
can't keep down.
* * *
The Cabbage staff has thrown out
its dragnet and now has in its clutch
es another fish who will imitate a kip
pered herring at a Friday night spread.
We stuff him and he stuffs you. We
introduce Alonzo K. Fish, now getting
by (we hope) under the name of S.
G. Trimble. His communication to
day makes it necessary for us to in
clude him in our insane midst to keep
him from putting stuff in the colyum.

Dear Head of Cabbages:
I see you now employ a staff of as
sistants and 1 therefore write to ask for
employment. Not that I am so swelled
up I think I'm a Will, Wallace or Tom
Irwin, for one should always begin a
letter like this modestly. Fortune, dear
sir, put no "win" in my name. I am only
a scribbling wreck of poverty, a son of
a sonneteer. 1 am, as you have now de
tected, a poet. 1 wish you to publish
my poems. This high degree of speciali
zation 011 your staff will improve your
colyum, for I shall make the desert
bloom like a cabbage. I have music in
my soul and my music shall stand along
side of, tlio it would not compete with,
your rare wit. The difference between
words and music is this. When a San
Francisco evening newspaper publishes
an article by "Bricklets" Morse saying
his eleven is going better than ever,
that's mere words. But when the Stan
ford correspondent can say the same
thing about his outfit —that's music! So,
Tom, the piper's son, let me be your
pied piper of Omelet. I can pi your
colyum every day—and generally do. I
hasten to explain how we shall perform.
Say you write in prose about something
as you did about the intelligence test the
other day. Everybody laughs till they
need an antidote. I shall then furnish
you and them such a* contribution as ; :
The Spell of Intelligence Tests
(W r itli apologies to R. W. Service)
I wanted the key and I sought it,
1 crammed and I dug like a slave;
Was it sport or a dance —I forgot them,
1 hurled my youth into a grave.
I wanted the key, audi got it—
Came out with Phi Beta last fall—
Yet somehow brains not what 1 thought
them,
And somehow the key isn't all.
No! There's the test. (Have you seen
it?)
It's the cussedest test that 1 know,
From the damn fool questions they ask
you
To the split-second watches they show.
Some say profs were nuts when they
made it,
All know it's a fine test to shun,
You bet; and there's some as were
flunked
As by no test on earth—and I'm one.
Start with pride and with grades (darn
good way),
You like it a bit for a minute
But soon you are worse than the worst.
Like some kinds of sinning, when in it
It twists you from sage to a fool.
And it gets and it bludgeons you still,
And the ties, oh, they beckon and
beckon,
And I ought to go home —and I will.
They're making my highbrows diminish,
I'm sick of intelligence test,
By psychology skinned to a frazzle,
I'll pike back to ma and the rest.
I'll work with the section gang boys,
It's hell, haven't tried it before,
But it's better than this by a damsite,
And it's me for some brawn once
more.
Yesterday we celebrated Columbus'
discovery of America. In future we
shall celebrate the "13th" as the day-
Cabbages discovered.
Yours truly.
Trim Bull.
* * *
Nothing new. Same egg that has
wrecked the colyum more or less for
over a year, only this time he comes
round and rings the trontdoor bell as
he ought to instead of climbing in
the back porch and raising ructions
in the pantry. Has bad record. Been
Daily make-up man and what-not.
Worst known crime being only male
contributor to last women's pink
sheet. Chance for atonement via this
colyum.

Prof—What are the strong vowels?
Stude —A, E, and O.
Prof —And the weak ones?
Stude —U and I.

Dear Head of Cabbages:
I see you now employ a staff of as
sistants and 1 therefore write to ask for
employment. Not that I am so swelled
up I think I'm a Will, Wallace or Tom
Irwin, for one should always begin a
letter like this modestly. Fortune, dear
sir, put no "win" in my name. I am only
a scribbling wreck of poverty, a son of
a sonneteer. 1 am, as you have now de
tected, a poet. 1 wish you to publish
my poems. This high degree of speciali
zation 011 your staff will improve your
colyum, for I shall make the desert
bloom like a cabbage. I have music in
my soul and my music shall stand along
side of, tlio it would not compete with,
your rare wit. The difference between
words and music is this. When a San
Francisco evening newspaper publishes
an article by "Bricklets" Morse saying
his eleven is going better than ever,
that's mere words. But when the Stan
ford correspondent can say the same
thing about his outfit —that's music! So,
Tom, the piper's son, let me be your
pied piper of Omelet. I can pi your
colyum every day—and generally do. I
hasten to explain how we shall perform.
Say you write in prose about something
as you did about the intelligence test the
other day. Everybody laughs till they
need an antidote. I shall then furnish
you and them such a* contribution as ; :
The Spell of Intelligence Tests
(W r itli apologies to R. W. Service)
I wanted the key and I sought it,
1 crammed and I dug like a slave;
Was it sport or a dance —I forgot them,
1 hurled my youth into a grave.
I wanted the key, audi got it—
Came out with Phi Beta last fall—
Yet somehow brains not what 1 thought
them,
And somehow the key isn't all.
No! There's the test. (Have you seen
it?)
It's the cussedest test that 1 know,
From the damn fool questions they ask
you
To the split-second watches they show.
Some say profs were nuts when they
made it,
All know it's a fine test to shun,
You bet; and there's some as were
flunked
As by no test on earth—and I'm one.
Start with pride and with grades (darn
good way),
You like it a bit for a minute
But soon you are worse than the worst.
Like some kinds of sinning, when in it
It twists you from sage to a fool.
And it gets and it bludgeons you still,
And the ties, oh, they beckon and
beckon,
And I ought to go home —and I will.
They're making my highbrows diminish,
I'm sick of intelligence test,
By psychology skinned to a frazzle,
I'll pike back to ma and the rest.
I'll work with the section gang boys,
It's hell, haven't tried it before,
But it's better than this by a damsite,
And it's me for some brawn once
more.
Yesterday we celebrated Columbus'
discovery of America. In future we
shall celebrate the "13th" as the day-
Cabbages discovered.
Yours truly.
Trim Bull.

The Cabbage staff has thrown out
its dragnet and now has in its clutch
es another fish who will imitate a kip
pered herring at a Friday night spread.
We stuff him and he stuffs you. We
introduce Alonzo K. Fish, now getting
by (we hope) under the name of S.
G. Trimble. His communication to
day makes it necessary for us to in
clude him in our insane midst to keep
him from putting stuff in the colyum.

The Farm, Oct. 13.
Dear Head of Cabbages:
I see you now employ a staff of as
sistants and 1 therefore write to ask for
employment. Not that I am so swelled
up I think I'm a Will, Wallace or Tom
Irwin, for one should always begin a
letter like this modestly. Fortune, dear
sir, put no "win" in my name. I am only
a scribbling wreck of poverty, a son of
a sonneteer. 1 am, as you have now de
tected, a poet. 1 wish you to publish
my poems. This high degree of speciali
zation 011 your staff will improve your
colyum, for I shall make the desert
bloom like a cabbage. I have music in
my soul and my music shall stand along
side of, tlio it would not compete with,
your rare wit. The difference between
words and music is this. When a San
Francisco evening newspaper publishes
an article by "Bricklets" Morse saying
his eleven is going better than ever,
that's mere words. But when the Stan
ford correspondent can say the same
thing about his outfit —that's music! So,
Tom, the piper's son, let me be your
pied piper of Omelet. I can pi your
colyum every day—and generally do. I
hasten to explain how we shall perform.
Say you write in prose about something
as you did about the intelligence test the
other day. Everybody laughs till they
need an antidote. I shall then furnish
you and them such a* contribution as ; :
The Spell of Intelligence Tests
(W r itli apologies to R. W. Service)
I wanted the key and I sought it,
1 crammed and I dug like a slave;
Was it sport or a dance —I forgot them,
1 hurled my youth into a grave.
I wanted the key, audi got it—
Came out with Phi Beta last fall—
Yet somehow brains not what 1 thought
them,
And somehow the key isn't all.
No! There's the test. (Have you seen
it?)
It's the cussedest test that 1 know,
From the damn fool questions they ask
you
To the split-second watches they show.
Some say profs were nuts when they
made it,
All know it's a fine test to shun,
You bet; and there's some as were
flunked
As by no test on earth—and I'm one.
Start with pride and with grades (darn
good way),
You like it a bit for a minute
But soon you are worse than the worst.
Like some kinds of sinning, when in it
It twists you from sage to a fool.
And it gets and it bludgeons you still,
And the ties, oh, they beckon and
beckon,
And I ought to go home —and I will.
They're making my highbrows diminish,
I'm sick of intelligence test,
By psychology skinned to a frazzle,
I'll pike back to ma and the rest.
I'll work with the section gang boys,
It's hell, haven't tried it before,
But it's better than this by a damsite,
And it's me for some brawn once
more.
Yesterday we celebrated Columbus'
discovery of America. In future we
shall celebrate the "13th" as the day-
Cabbages discovered.
Yours truly.
Trim Bull.

Nothing new. Same egg that has
wrecked the colyum more or less for
over a year, only this time he comes
round and rings the trontdoor bell as
he ought to instead of climbing in
the back porch and raising ructions
in the pantry. Has bad record. Been
Daily make-up man and what-not.
Worst known crime being only male
contributor to last women's pink
sheet. Chance for atonement via this
colyum.

Prof—What are the strong vowels?
Stude —A, E, and O.
Prof —And the weak ones?
Stude —U and I.
