# EDITOR OF CARDINAL CALLS FOR MORE COPY
## 
### 
A call for short stories full of action
or humor stories of any sort has been
sent out by W. F. Lewis, '21, editor of
the Stanford Cardinal. The publication
is in especial need of several new regu
lar contributors of fiction, according to
Lewis, who blames the current impres
sion that present contributors to the
Cardinal are to be limited for the short
age of copy.
Poems, skits, articles of general in
terest, or anything else in the Cardinal's
field of journalistic endeavor are so
licited by the editor. All copy for the
November issue of the publication must
be presented by the 18th of this month.
Stories are to be given to Lewis at
Room 59, Sequoia, or mailed to The
Cardinal, campus.
