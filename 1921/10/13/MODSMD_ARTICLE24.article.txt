# WOMEN CONCENTRATING ON HOCKEY PRACTICE
## 
### 
Due to the large turnout of new mate
; rial and the return of old players, the
Stanford women's hockey season looks
good. The victorious senior class team,
which won last year's junior honors
from California and Mills, is out in full
for practice. Sophomore tryouts num
ber thirty-two, large enough for three
I teams. Freshman enthusiasm for team
membership is almost as high. Miss
! Helen Bunting, director of women's
athletics, urges juniors to make a good
showing at the next field practice as
teams will be chosen within the next
two weeks. Intensive drilling will then
begin for the games at Mills, Novem
ber 12.
