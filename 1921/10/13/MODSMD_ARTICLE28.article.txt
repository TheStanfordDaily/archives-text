# ZOOLOGY CRUISE SUBJECT OF TALK
## Four Months' Trip in Gulf of Lower California Uncovers Number of Fine Specimens 
### 
Interesting experiences encountered
while on a research expedition to the
Gulf of Mexico, were given last night
by Joseph C. Chamberlin, in a talk
j before the Zoology Club, at the Worn
j en's Clubhouse.
Chamberlin was one of six Stan
ford men to be chosen for the expe
j dition and the only underclass man.
The trip covered a period of four
months, the members leaving in July.
The time was spent in cruising about
' the Gulf of Lower California in the
i schooner Silver Gate which was char
j tered for the trip. The territory
: which this expedition covered, is rich
:in zoological and biological speci
mens, and as it has not been exten
! sively covered before, yielded a large
collection of birds, bird-eggs, plants
j and smaller animals.
Chamberlin exhibited some pictures
J taken on the various islands where
the research was conducted. He also
j told of a tribe of rather unfriendly
natives encountered 011 the island of
| Tiburon. These natives are noted for
their fleetness of foot, and the mem
bers of the research party were told
that the men of the tribe often ran
down such game as deer and jack
rabbits. Vast salt beds on San Jose
Island offered excellent ground for in
vestigation. On one island a new
species of lizard was found, and a
species of black jackrabbit was dis
covered. On the return trip, which
was made in the late summer, the
waters in the north gulf showed
phosphorescent properties, and a
careful study of this phenomenon was
made by the members of the party.
: After his talk, Chamberlin answered
| many questions pertaining to the trip
and its results.
C. D. Duncan of the Zoology depart
ment gave an interesting talk 011 his
experiences while on a 5000-mile re
search trip through California, Ari-
I zona, New Mexico, and Texas. Mr.
j Duncan accompanied Mr. Ferris, who
i was commissioned to investigate the
j scaled insects of this region, and pub
lish his findings in the form of a bulle
i tin. This trip covered a period of
| three months, and carried the investi
gators to the Grand Canyon of Colo
rado. Duncan told of an alkali lake
bottom which the party encountered,
where the surface was so dry and
hard that he was able to drive a Ford
over it at the rate of forty miles
an hour. The scarcity of animals
throughout these regions was the
most remarkable characteristic, along

with the great abundance of plant
life.
A business meeting of the Zoology
Club preceded the talks, at which new
officers were elected. Herb Mason, '19,
was elected president, Miss Mary
Sloan, '22, vice-president, and Joseph
C. Chamberlin, '23, secretary-treasurer.
Reports of various committeees were
heard, assessments made for the en
suing quarter, and B. C. Cain, the re
tiring president, reported that an at
tempt was being made to recover the
Zoology Clubhouse for the use of the
club members.
