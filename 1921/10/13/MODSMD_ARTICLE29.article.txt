# NEWSPAPER FILES ON 19TH CENTURY ARRIVE FOR CAMPUS LIBRARY
## 
### 
The Stanford University Library
has just received a carload of news
papers, comprising more than 300 vol
umes, which are considered to be a
most important acquisition in the
library's exchange account with the
Library of Congress in Washington,
D.C. These papers include files of
the .National Intelligencer, and the

Washington Globe, covering a period
ranging from 1809-1573, and shorter
files of such papers as the Telegraph,
the National Journal, and the Madi
sonian. By this addition, students of
American political history, and of
American politics are provided im
portant newspaper sources for the
first sixty years of the 19th century.
From its inception in 1800 the Na
tional Intelligencer became the re
cognized organ of the Republican
Party, and remained the semi-official
spokesman of the successive admin
istrations until the inauguration of
Andrew Jackson, in 1829.
The Washington Telegraph, of
which a few files are on hand, was
for a short period the organ of the
Jackson administration, but in IS3O
the Globe, known as the most import
ant party organ in American political
history, was founded, and became and
remained the mouthpiece of the ad
ministration.
