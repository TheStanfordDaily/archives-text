# AUSTRIAN RELIEF WORK DESCRIBED BY A. E. TAYLOR

### 
"No one can understand the mental
attitude of the Austrian people without
remembering the peculiar policies adopt
ed by their government," Doctor Alonzo
Taylor declared in his lecture last night
on "The Work of the American Relief
Administration in Austria." Dr. Taylor,
whose lecture was given in the Little
theater under the auspices of the V. M.
C. A., outlined the peculiar conditions
of hardship under which the Austrians
were forced to live, and sketched the
work of relief.
The government of Austria greatly
exaggerated local interests against na
tional affairs, said Dr. Taylor, thus pre
paring the way for an inevitable separa
tion of the Empire. "The oppression of
the Haspburgs was entirely uncalled
for," he continued, "and found imme
diate expression in the war, where 15,-
(X) 0 Czechs were executed for treason."
At present Austria is not satisfied
with the existing treaty of peace, which
includes ten million Germans in her
country, Dr. Talyor said. Geographic
objections are not, however, of the most
importance. The true cause of Aus
trian complaint against the treaty is
found in the provision for public prop
erty and the problem of reimbursing
citizens left with worthless promises
to pay in return for their property.
Dr. Taylor stated that Austria, who
before the war was exporting, five
months later was experiencing the pangs
of hunger. The Germans never man
aged their affairs in Austria to a rea
sonable degree, while the Hungarians
refused to send food to the starving at
Vienna.
These conditions of famine were
known first in Paris. The first relief
work was not American but inter-allied
under a food commission of the Su
preme Economic Council. Owing to the
American attitude toward commerce, di
rect aid could not be extended at once
by the United States.
Dr. Taylor gave a brief outline of the
procedure of relief workers entering a
country. A survey is first made in con
nection with an auditor and an expert
on transportation. A warehouse must
be organized from whence the food is
turned over to local committees to be
then distributed in zones and rationed
out in grams to the people. Reports
of this work, with care that all races
and creeds receive equal distribution,
provide problems in economics, sociol
ogy, transportation, communication, and
administration. The moral influence of
capable Americans in uniform was
