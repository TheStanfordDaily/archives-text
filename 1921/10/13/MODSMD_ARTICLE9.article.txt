# COACH, NESTORIA PLAN COURSE FOR FOOTBALL PUBLIC
## More Detailed Knowledge of Game to Help Our Teams, Is View Taken by Powell 
### 
Xestoria Debating Society announced
today, through its president, Sinclair G.
Trimble, '22, that it lias completed ar
rangements with Physical Director Wal-
I ter Powell 'for a series of lectures to
be presented weekly by Stanford coaches
beginning next Wednesday evening, on
"The Technique of American Football."
The course, for such it amounts to. is
open to students, faculty and the gen
eral public.
Powell is most enthusiastic for the
project and agrees with Xestoria that it
will be most valuable for building up a
thoroughly intelligent rooting section
that will be a real stimulant to the
teams.
He says: "When the players realize
that the cheers in the grandstand come
from people well enough versed in foot
ball technique to appreciate both the in
| dividual efforts and machine work that
j makes any given play successful in such
a complex sport as the American game,
they are going to feel more encouraged
than if they only receive cheers from
people who, while appreciating the gain
made, have missed all the fine points.
The best players are not always the most
spectacular. We want to teach the Stan
ford public to appreciate solid worth in
all its aspects."
Coach "Andy" Smith has been giving
a course at the University of California,
entitled "The Strategy of American
Football," that has far outdistanced all
other courses on the Bruin campus in
popularity. Students, faculty and resi
de: ts of all the bay communities have
thronged the class-room, with the re
sult that more than one city sporting
writer has commented on the fact that
California rooters are massing a knowl
edge of what is fine playing and a con
sequent appreciation of the efforts of
the Bears that is a genuine aid to the
players.
Present plans of Walter Powell and
Nestoria call for the appearance on the
lecture platform of Coaches Van Gent,
| Fitzgerald and possibly others of those
most thoroughly versified in the game in
.this vicinity. Complete details will ap
pear in The Daily Palo Alto next Mon
day.
