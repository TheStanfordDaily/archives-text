# OLDER POINTS OUT EDITOR'S DIFFICULTIES
## Veteran Editor of Coast Says That Sensationalism Must be Ousted by the People 
### 
"There is only one way to stop sensa
tionalism. That is for the people to stop
wanting it." This was the principal
thought expressed by Fremont Older,
editor of the San Francisco Call, given
last night in room 12 of the Law build
ing, in an informal talk under the au
spices of the Euphronia Debating So
ciety. "The public taste controls a news
paper, contrary to the popular impres
sion that a newspaper is the molder of
the public's taste. To be perfectly frank,
we are more interested in sensational
stories. It is human nature to prefer
the petty faults of our neighbors to
economics.
"An editor has to go according to the
tastes of the people. lie cannot force
them to read the sober, thoughtful facts.
Without circulation no paper can suc
ceed. Sensational stories, termed ob
jectionable, are therefore necessary to
maintain circulation. We nearly all like
the sensational or mysterous, whether
we admit it or not. We will have to get
over this desire for sensation, but until
we do the newspaper will have to meet
the demand for it."
Speaking of the sensational headlines
in vogue at present, Mr. Older said:
"There can be no criticism of the size
of type used by the paper; this is merely
a statement of its wares. A great many
people are fooled by a quiet headline
and think that the articles are not sen
sational, whereas the exact reverse is
often true. Many papers gain a reputa
tion for conservativeness through a con
servative make-up, while the stories are
really as spicy as any."
In answer to a question concerning
capitalism and the newspaper, Mr. Older
said: "Most newspapers are necessarily
controlled by capitalists, as they are pri
marily -capitalistic enterprises. I think
that the editors of capitalistic papers
really believe their statements. In fact,
I think that the editor of the worst capi
talistic newspaper in the country be
lieves in what he is doing. A newspaper
has to be business enterprise necessarily;
but nearly all editors try to be fair anil
print the news honestly."
Replying to a question as to his opin
ion of Upton Sinclair's "The Brass
Check," Mr. Older stated as his criticism
that Sinclair makes out all capitalist edi
tors to be deliberate villains, turning
everything to capital's end, rather than
people who honestly believe in the prin
ciples that give rise to capitalism. "There
was some basis for what Sinclair said,
but in my opinion it was very exag
gerated and unfair, and was written in
a spirit of bitterness." It is impossible
to keep propaganda entirely out of a
paper, he stated, as the editor plays up
the thing he himself believes in, and the
reporter invariably favors the points that
appeal to him.
"I feel free to say that there is more
danger from the subscribers' dictating
the policy of a newspaper than the ad
vertisers," Mr. Older announced in re
ply to a query as to the belief that ad
vertisers hold a club over the paper.
"The advertisers are tolerant, and know
that the paper has to do certain things.
The public is not so tolerant, and often
forces a paper, through fear of de
creased circulation, to take the wrong
side because it is the popular one."
In giving his opinion on the value of
a college education as a basis for jour
nalism. Mr. Older said that while not
an absolute necessity, university training
will very often discover the talent in a
man. "Of the college trained men who
have made good in journalism, the uni
versity may be given credit for the
larger part of their abilities." Simplicity,
he said, or the ability to write in the
language of the common man, is the
most important thing a young man en
tering journalism can learn.
Preceding Mr. Older's talk, throe
members of Euphronia made short
speeches on their views of what was
wrong with the American press today.
C. V. Smith told of the lack of sincerity,
and the tendency of the modern paper
to print everything to the tune of jazz
and razz. M. O. Tobriner spoke of the
propaganda put forth, and its dangers
when disguised as news. President Ellis
Flirschfeld spoke of the lack of system
of the advertisers in putting his wares
before the public.

lieves in what he is doing. A newspaper
has to be business enterprise necessarily;
but nearly all editors try to be fair anil
print the news honestly."
Replying to a question as to his opin
ion of Upton Sinclair's "The Brass
Check," Mr. Older stated as his criticism
that Sinclair makes out all capitalist edi
tors to be deliberate villains, turning
everything to capital's end, rather than
people who honestly believe in the prin
ciples that give rise to capitalism. "There
was some basis for what Sinclair said,
but in my opinion it was very exag
gerated and unfair, and was written in
a spirit of bitterness." It is impossible
to keep propaganda entirely out of a
paper, he stated, as the editor plays up
the thing he himself believes in, and the
reporter invariably favors the points that
appeal to him.
"I feel free to say that there is more
danger from the subscribers' dictating
the policy of a newspaper than the ad
vertisers," Mr. Older announced in re
ply to a query as to the belief that ad
vertisers hold a club over the paper.
"The advertisers are tolerant, and know
that the paper has to do certain things.
The public is not so tolerant, and often
forces a paper, through fear of de
creased circulation, to take the wrong
side because it is the popular one."
In giving his opinion on the value of
a college education as a basis for jour
nalism. Mr. Older said that while not
an absolute necessity, university training
will very often discover the talent in a
man. "Of the college trained men who
have made good in journalism, the uni
versity may be given credit for the
larger part of their abilities." Simplicity,
he said, or the ability to write in the
language of the common man, is the
most important thing a young man en
tering journalism can learn.
Preceding Mr. Older's talk, throe
members of Euphronia made short
speeches on their views of what was
wrong with the American press today.
C. V. Smith told of the lack of sincerity,
and the tendency of the modern paper
to print everything to the tune of jazz
and razz. M. O. Tobriner spoke of the
propaganda put forth, and its dangers
when disguised as news. President Ellis
Flirschfeld spoke of the lack of system
of the advertisers in putting his wares
before the public.
"There is only one way to stop sensa
tionalism. That is for the people to stop
wanting it." This was the principal
thought expressed by Fremont Older,
editor of the San Francisco Call, given
last night in room 12 of the Law build
ing, in an informal talk under the au
spices of the Euphronia Debating So
ciety. "The public taste controls a news
paper, contrary to the popular impres
sion that a newspaper is the molder of
the public's taste. To be perfectly frank,
we are more interested in sensational
stories. It is human nature to prefer
the petty faults of our neighbors to
economics.
"An editor has to go according to the
tastes of the people. lie cannot force
them to read the sober, thoughtful facts.
Without circulation no paper can suc
ceed. Sensational stories, termed ob
jectionable, are therefore necessary to
maintain circulation. We nearly all like
the sensational or mysterous, whether
we admit it or not. We will have to get
over this desire for sensation, but until
we do the newspaper will have to meet
the demand for it."
Speaking of the sensational headlines
in vogue at present, Mr. Older said:
"There can be no criticism of the size
of type used by the paper; this is merely
a statement of its wares. A great many
people are fooled by a quiet headline
and think that the articles are not sen
sational, whereas the exact reverse is
often true. Many papers gain a reputa
tion for conservativeness through a con
servative make-up, while the stories are
really as spicy as any."
In answer to a question concerning
capitalism and the newspaper, Mr. Older
said: "Most newspapers are necessarily
controlled by capitalists, as they are pri
marily -capitalistic enterprises. I think
that the editors of capitalistic papers
really believe their statements. In fact,
I think that the editor of the worst capi
talistic newspaper in the country be
lieves in what he is doing. A newspaper
