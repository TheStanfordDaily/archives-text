# STANFORD-U.C. WOMEN TO HOED SWIM MEET
## 
### 
Stanford women will meet California
in swimming events November 5. This
is the agreement to the California plan
which passed in the women's athletic
association board meeting yesterday aft
ernoon. The meet will he the first that
Stanford teams have entered with any
other university in three years. The
California pool has been closed during
thjs period and Mills College has no fa
cilities with which to train a squad. In
tercollegiate competition has been the
desire of every class team which Mrs.
Brandsten has coached for the past three
seasons, and it goes without saying what
the turnout will be at the first tryout on
Monday. Three of the all-star team for
last year have entered their names for
practice : Carey Bailard, '22 ; Margaret
Carlsmith, '22, and Doris Stevenson, '22.
The events will consist of the relay,
25, 50 and 100-yard dash, with the crawl
and the 25-yard for breast and back
strokes. There will be no long distance
competition. The plunge for distance
and diving feats are to finish the pro
gram. Four class teams from each var
sity are to compete for freshman, sopho
more, junior and senior honors in all
events. Dorothy Hare, '22, who is lining
up women for practice, urges all those
interested in the sport to try out, espe
cially the freshmen, as all new mate
rial possible is needed to compete with
the larger university. No limits are to
be made as to the number on each team.
Regular practice is to start immediately
on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4:20
o'clock.
