Tenth Organ Concerto G. F. Hatidcl
Adagio Allegro,
Aria. *
Allegro.
Arranged with cadenza for organ
alone by Alexander Guilmant, Handel
wrote twenty concertos for organ and
orchestra which were designed not only
to display hi* powers as a virtuoso, but
also his skill in extemporaneous organi
zation. His works for the organ show
the same breadth and freshness of style
found in his oratorios, with less com
plexity than the music of Bach. The
two composers were born in the same
year, but never met, as Handel spent |
many years of his life in England.
In tliis concerto the composer wrote j
"Organo ad libitum," after the first Al- j
legro. The Aria inserted by Guilmant i
tits admirably, although originally from j
the twelfth concerto for strings.
Ave Maria Bach-Goutiod
Ariel ! Joseph Round
Finale from the "Grand Piece
Symphonique" Cesar Fraitck
