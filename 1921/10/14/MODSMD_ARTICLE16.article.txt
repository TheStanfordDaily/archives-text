# STADIUM TURF PLANTING WILL BEGIN AT ONCE
## Work on Stadium Appears as Polishing the Rough Edges of a Realized Achievement 
### (By C. H. Prior, '23 
Climbing the steps of the embankment
at the west end of the stadium, the first
glimpse into that yawning pit below
nearly takes the breath away.
And if the person standing there is a
Stanford student he or she will under
stand more clearly what Dean Culver
felt when lie said: "Go down to the sta
dium and stand alone on the topmost
embankment if you need inspiration for
the forthcoming college year. It is a
good place to be, for it typifies in a
wonderful fashion what the world has
come to know as the Stanford Spirit."
Off across the playing field at the
open end of the horse-shoe a steam
shovel is snorting and tugging as it tears
down the embankment which blocks the
eastern end of the 220-yard straight
away that will extend out of the open
end of the horse-shoe. Somewhat nearer
than the steam shovel, at the eastern
edge of what will lie the playing field, a
couple of graders are engaged in the
final process of leveling the field. A
Fresno scraper is also on the job near
them and is pulled by four horses, two
whites and two blacks—spirited fellows
who arch their necks in proud fashion
as though they realize their part in the
construction of the Big Bowl.
Following the scraper and graders is
the water wagon which is soaking up
the ground for the planker and roller.
True to the ancient traditions of their
race, the team of dun-colored mules on
the planker drag sleepily along with the
general attitude of not caring whether
school keeps or not. Directly below, a
gang of men are spreading a thin layer
of sand on the field which will be rolled
in with the clay soil in order to make
the turf drain more easily. The work
of planting the turf will be started
within the next day or so.
There are horses, mules and men
scattered about on the works. Some
are hauling dirt away from the steam
shovel; others are up on the crest of
the embankment with scrapers, or help
ing to pull lumber and other material
into position. At both ends of the horse
shoe the carpenters are just completing
the final seats at the top and have
started to put up the fence which will
circle the crest. On the outside the
shrubs are planted on more than half
the distance around the Bowl and work
is going on steadily.
Everybody is working, not with the
attitude of an enterprise just started,
but with the almost parental attitude of
accomplishment. They are putting on
the finishing touches. The stadium may
be compared to a huge gem in the rough
or a piece of literary work in the first
draft. The men working there now are
polishing off the roughness and bring
ing the Stanford stadium into comple
tion.
This is the way the stadium looked
yesterday about 4 o'clock in the after
noon.

of planting the turf will be started
within the next day or so.
There are horses, mules and men
scattered about on the works. Some
are hauling dirt away from the steam
shovel; others are up on the crest of
the embankment with scrapers, or help
ing to pull lumber and other material
into position. At both ends of the horse
shoe the carpenters are just completing
the final seats at the top and have
started to put up the fence which will
circle the crest. On the outside the
shrubs are planted on more than half
the distance around the Bowl and work
is going on steadily.
Everybody is working, not with the
attitude of an enterprise just started,
but with the almost parental attitude of
accomplishment. They are putting on
the finishing touches. The stadium may
be compared to a huge gem in the rough
or a piece of literary work in the first
draft. The men working there now are
polishing off the roughness and bring
ing the Stanford stadium into comple
tion.
This is the way the stadium looked
yesterday about 4 o'clock in the after
noon.
Climbing the steps of the embankment
at the west end of the stadium, the first
glimpse into that yawning pit below
nearly takes the breath away.
And if the person standing there is a
Stanford student he or she will under
stand more clearly what Dean Culver
felt when lie said: "Go down to the sta
dium and stand alone on the topmost
embankment if you need inspiration for
the forthcoming college year. It is a
good place to be, for it typifies in a
wonderful fashion what the world has
come to know as the Stanford Spirit."
Off across the playing field at the
open end of the horse-shoe a steam
shovel is snorting and tugging as it tears
down the embankment which blocks the
eastern end of the 220-yard straight
away that will extend out of the open
end of the horse-shoe. Somewhat nearer
than the steam shovel, at the eastern
edge of what will lie the playing field, a
couple of graders are engaged in the
final process of leveling the field. A
Fresno scraper is also on the job near
them and is pulled by four horses, two
whites and two blacks—spirited fellows
who arch their necks in proud fashion
as though they realize their part in the
construction of the Big Bowl.
Following the scraper and graders is
the water wagon which is soaking up
the ground for the planker and roller.
True to the ancient traditions of their
race, the team of dun-colored mules on
the planker drag sleepily along with the
general attitude of not caring whether
school keeps or not. Directly below, a
gang of men are spreading a thin layer
of sand on the field which will be rolled
in with the clay soil in order to make
the turf drain more easily. The work
of planting the turf will be started
within the next day or so.
