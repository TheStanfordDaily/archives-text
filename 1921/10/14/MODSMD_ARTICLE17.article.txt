# "Heart of Pierrot" Will Be Repeated Tomorrow In Castelleja Gardens
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon, at 3:30,
"The Heart of Pierrot" will be
presented for the benefit of the
Stadium Fund, by the original
cast in the Castelleja Gardens.
The scenery and costumes to be
used are those which were spe
cially designed for the first pro
duction at Green Gables, this
summer. Lester Seib plays the
title role opposite Frances Phil
lips. Donaldine Cameron, Helen
Whitney, Arnold Bayley, Nelson
Valjean, and several 'other cam
pus actors are supported by a
few Palo Alto players, as the
masque is cast.
Business manager L. H. Dills
urges those who find it conveni
ent, to get their tickets early,
since he expects a large sale at
the door. There has been a
limited number printed. Dills
pointed out, and judging from
the number of requests Coach
Davis has received for repeti
tion, the crowd will he quite
large.
