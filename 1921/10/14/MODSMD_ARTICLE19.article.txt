Parking of automobiles along the east end of the quadrangle while
the railroad crossings were being repaired has resurrected the time-worn
automobile (juestion. Ihe chains which usually enclose the arcawa}
between the main quadrangle and the new quadrangle, of which the
library and the art gallery are the first buildings, have not been in place
for the past week, and parking and traffic have been free, lhe imprac
ticability of leaving this thoroughfare open permanently has been demon
strated during these few days.
Originally machines were barred because the noise they made dis
turbed the classes in session along that side of the quad. With the
increase in the number of machines which is very evident this year a
new element has entered into the question. The road along the east side
of the quadrangle has long been used as a lounging place for the men
between classes. There during the ten-minute recess between classes the
jimmy-pipe and cigarette and the gab-fest have held sway.
Many students, both men and women, cross this road going to
and from the library. With the constant passing of automobiles through
this area groups have been driven off the road and against the quad or to
the steps, while the life, liberty, and pursuit of knowledge of students
crossing have been endangered. \\ ith the closing of this road again
during class hours the festive "session" will return to its own, and a
student will be able to go to the library without having to watch the
traftic.

With the ever-increasing number of automobiles at Stanford there
is always the fear that the lines of social cleavage will become more pro
nounced. The cry that Stanford is becoming a rich man's institution is
repeatedly heard with the appearance of more machines. This, however,
does not seem to be the case. The character of the automobile-owning
gentry seems to be entirely democratic. Many men who are working
their way through Stanford are now the owners of automobiles. This is
explained by the drop in prices of machines during the past year and the
fact that they can be purchased for almost a song. The automobile owner
of today is not necessarily one blessed with a large share of the coin of
the realm.

Many people drive out from Palo Alto in the morning with large
machines practically empty, and in doing so they pass a crowd of students
waiting for or boarding the street cars which are already crowded. Often
these students are late for their classes and find it necessary to wait for
another car to come along before they can start for the campus. An
offer of a ride would be especially appreciated by these people. At best
the transportation afforded by the campus trolley is something to be left
unmentioned and constant commuting over the line is far from pleasant.
It would be too bad to have one of the pleasantest customs go by the
boards because of pure thoughtlessness. It costs no more to operate a
machine that is full than it does an empty one, and the effect that giving
a lift has on the recipient, the driver, and the democratic spirit of Stan
ford is immeasurable.

Many people drive out from Palo Alto in the morning with large
machines practically empty, and in doing so they pass a crowd of students
waiting for or boarding the street cars which are already crowded. Often
these students are late for their classes and find it necessary to wait for
another car to come along before they can start for the campus. An
offer of a ride would be especially appreciated by these people. At best
the transportation afforded by the campus trolley is something to be left
unmentioned and constant commuting over the line is far from pleasant.
It would be too bad to have one of the pleasantest customs go by the
boards because of pure thoughtlessness. It costs no more to operate a
machine that is full than it does an empty one, and the effect that giving
a lift has on the recipient, the driver, and the democratic spirit of Stan
ford is immeasurable.

With the ever-increasing number of automobiles at Stanford there
is always the fear that the lines of social cleavage will become more pro
nounced. The cry that Stanford is becoming a rich man's institution is
repeatedly heard with the appearance of more machines. This, however,
does not seem to be the case. The character of the automobile-owning
gentry seems to be entirely democratic. Many men who are working
their way through Stanford are now the owners of automobiles. This is
explained by the drop in prices of machines during the past year and the
fact that they can be purchased for almost a song. The automobile owner
of today is not necessarily one blessed with a large share of the coin of
