# Special Films Arranged For Chemistry Students
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Chemistry Club
held in the Chemistry Building, at
4:20 p.m. Thursday afternoon, it was
decided to arrange for moving pic
tures. Wallace Craig, president of
the Chemistry Club, urged the advisa
bility of this step which will assist
the students considerably in their
various chemistry courses. The films
will be secured from a company in
Pittsburgh, Pa., and will be shown at
frequent intervals.
It was also decided that instead of
publishing all the news of the Chem
istry department through the Daily
Palo Alto a committee would be ap
pointed to assemble all the items of
interest and post them on the bulle
tin board in that building.
