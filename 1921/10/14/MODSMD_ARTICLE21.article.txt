# CABBAGES AND THINGS

r T.1.. '23 »l
Our lead-off line yesterday was the
bunk. Every time we've opened our
heads since that, somebody's yodeled,
"Say it with Cabbages!" Really, some
things we get off our chest can't be
said through our colyum.

Coises!
We abominate the piker,
The loafer we despise,
The pessimist we all eschew
And others, (we surmise).
We hate the site of toddling snakes,
We loathe all these, but yet,
The guy we hand the palm tree to,
Bums our last cigarette.

There is another method some
times employed in the heartless
extraction of unconfined jollification
from human existence. A review of
the method is given below.

Was It Ever Thus?
Here we are at the football game,
Alexander. Place your hankie on the
seat, Alex, you might get soiled. Now
listen to your sweet pazazza and learn
to root like all the rest of the nice
people. Here comes the team, Alex!
Oh, dearie, aren't they perfectly
splendid! Now say "Ray, Ray, Ray,"
sugarplum. That's right, sweetie, but
not so loud. They might hear you.
Wave your hankie at them, cookie.
Oh, I forgot you were sitting on it.
There goes one of the Stanford boys
for a homerun! Quick, Alexander, say
"Bravo!" Wave your hand at him,
cherub, like all the rest of the gentle
manly boys. Oh, see the perfect kill
ing yell leader, honey. Isn't he go-o
orgeous! Listen! He says we're go
ing to give a skyrocket. There! I'll
bet he's pleased, chocolate drop! We
weren't at all loud and vulgar that
time. The team will think it's silent
prayer and be SO encouraged! Oh,
sweetheart, just listen to those awful
people screaming on the other side of
the field! I think we're ever so much
more polite, don't you? Oh, goodness
j gracious! DID you hear what that
horrid yell leader said, honeybunch?
Why he said, "Holler, you damph
ools! Yell your heads off!" I'm SO
supri-i-ised! Perhaps we'd better go,
Alexander, I think he's talking about
us. Oh, dear, and the team was en
joying it SO much, too.

St. Peter's Passkey
j For every loyal Stanford man,
Whatever be his name,
j There's a harp and wings in Heaven,
j If he plays the Stanford game.
I prophesy, not promise,
St. Peter's not my name,
But you'll get a pass to Heaven,
If you play the Stanford game.
You can smoke, and chew, and even
queen,
Or turn aside from fame.
You'll he an angel when you die,
If you play the Stanford game.
i You may write, or run, or wrestle,
You may be wild or tame.
But you'll ride a cloud in Heaven,
If you play the Stanford game.
You may belong to Hall or Row,
Commuters are the same.
But you'll disappoint the devil,
If you play the Stanford game.
You may be bald, and forty.
You may be old and lame.
But you'll find a place in Heaven,
If you play the Stanford game.
You may be rough or rougher,
And worse—l still proclaim.
You'll go right through the pearly
gates,
If you play the Stanford game.

The rules for this game ain't bein'
published this year in book form, but
if you brjjak one of 'em, you'll hear
about it. There's an awful lot of urn
pires hangin' around.

The main idea is not to spike any
body when you're goin' around the
bases. When you get to the home
plate and get a sheep hide, you won't
want to.

One of the known rules is to lay
off stealin' bases. You guys that's
signed up in thirteen steps of lunches
are in on a petty larceny deal.

Pardon us, brother shoplifter, we
forgot about our house being con
structed mostly of a transparent ma
terial.

Anyway, watch the new system
There's honor among thieves.

U TELLEM, OLYMPICS, YOU'VE
GOT CLUB FEET.
