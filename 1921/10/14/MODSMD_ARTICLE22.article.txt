# INTERIM ATHLETICS PLANNED BY STANFORD
## 
### 
A system of interclass athletics sim
ilar to that in eftcct in eastern universi
ties will be instituted at Stanford this
quarter by the directors of athletics.
Football will he the first sport to offer
interclass competition. Contests have
been scheduled for three teams consist
ing of freshmen, sophomores and upper
classmen. In addition the work of form- i
ing a 135-pound football squad is well
under way.
The idea of interclass athletics is pop
ularly established in the great colleges
and universities of the country, espe
cially in the east. A system of super
vision and coaching of the teams by
seniors is largely in use. In the early
days of Stanford this service of coach
ing was performed by members of the
senior class in minor athletics. Inter
class competition is a favorite means to
discover varsity material, besides pro
viding spirited recreation. Coach Andy
Smith of the University of California
utilizes several weeks before football
training season in developing interclass
gridiron contests from which he may
pick out good varsity candidates.
All but the first string men on the
freshman and varsity squads will be
eligible to play on the class teams. Tem
porary captains will be elected at the
first meeting. The men will practice
daily on the polo field which provides
plenty of space for the various squads.
It is planned to have a game between
the freshmen and upper classmen on
Friday, October 21. In case interclass
sports should attain the prestige which
they have in such universities as Prince
ton, Harvard and Yale, class numerals
may be awarded. At present gymnasium
credit is the extent of the promise.
A meeting of the thirty-two men
signed up for the 135-pound football
team will be held Monday at 4 o'clock
in Encina gymnasium. General plans
will be explained by J. S. McCutchan,
'23, who has been appointed by the var
sity football manager to manage the af
fairs of the squad. Two captains, one
from the freshmen and the other from
the upperclassmen, are to be elected to
take charge of scrimmage. Suits have
been provided for nearly all the men. It
is intended to make out a schedule of
games immediately, the majority of the
contests being with the neighboring high
| schools. The graduate manager is ne
| gotiating with U. C. to have the Blue
and Gold 135-pound men line up against
the Cardinal team on the morning of
October 12 in the afternoon of which the
varsity meet the University of Nevada.
No recognition has yet been made by
the executive council as to awarding of
letters.
