# MANY VETERANS ARE OUT FOR POSITIONS IN VARSITY BOXING
## 
### 
If a*large number of ring veterans
back at the University is any cri
terion of success, the Stanford boxing
squad is in for a banner year. Light
workouts are being held at the gym
nasium daily, and novices as well as
veterans"" are slowly rounding into
shape.
Real work in the squared circle will
commence sometime in November,
when Coach Harry Maloney is arrang
ing for a tournament in which every
man will have a chance to prove his
worth. Those who finally emerge as
winners in each weightt will receive
cups, donated by various merchants
in Palo Alto. The gloves should fly
thick and fast when the boys square
off, and Maloney is hopeful of un
covering some new talent.
Brad Simmons, featherweight, vet
eran of the U. C., U. S. C., and Los
Angeles Athletic Club bouts last year,
is on deck and ready to trade swats j
with anybody. In the lightweight di

vision there is Jimmy Ross, whose
sicence and punch have seldom been
beaten.
Bill Burkhart, who won his event in
the match with California last year,
is back again and is showing mid
season form. Burkhart will probably
be the mainstay of the welterweight
dviision. Illness kept "Husky" Was
sum from entering the ring with the
middleweight champion of California
last spring, but this year he'll be a
mighty hard man to stop at all.
In the heavy class there are Mark
Evans, a light heavyweight, another
winner over the Blue and Gold, and
Harley Carter, who shoves the indi
cator up toward the 200' mark every
time he gets on the scales. Carter
is playing football at Â» present, but
when the football season is over, he
will don the padded mitts.
There are 150 out for the manly
art, the largest ,number that ever
signed up for boxing at Stanford
Harry Maloney is showing the men
the rudiments of the game in his
morning class. In the afternoon
Jimmy Ross and Bill Burkhart are
helping out in the absence of Joe
Murphy.
