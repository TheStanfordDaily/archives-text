# SOCCER ELEVEN TO PLAY MATCH WITH BABE AGGREGATION
## 
### 
Due to the fact that the Young Men s
Hebrew Association of San Francisco
has withdrawn from the soccer league,
tlie Stanford eleven has no regular game
Saturday. Coach Harry Maloney has,
however, succeeded in Idling up the gap,
caused by the resignation of this team,
by getting the soccer eleven to substi
tute the Stanford 1925 soccer aggrega
tion. This gives the freshmen an un
usually heavy season and gives them two
scheduled games with the varsity. r l he
first of these games will be played on
the soccer field this afternoon at 4
o'clock, the second game coming on De
cember 3d. Of these games official scores
will be taken to determine the standing
of the two teams.
Both varsity and freshmen practice
has been going good during the past
week and both show that the Stanford
soccer squad lias powerful material to
work with. The varsity is working on
the art of cooperation and is daily show
ing improvement along that line. Ihe
freshmen have a number of former prep
school stars and have been showing up
to good advantage during the week. A
good many of the men who played on
Coach Maloney's summer freshmen
eleven are back and are making good
on the team. With these men the fresh
men should hold the varsity to a com
paratively small score.
Coach Maloney and Captain Gorman
are devoting a great deal of energy to
the development of the squad, and the
players are responding with an earnest
ness that bids fair to chase the Golden
Bear back to his abode across the bay.
The California game is scheduled for
the morning of November 19th, and it
will be the first game to be played in
the new stadium.
The lineups for this afternoon's game
have not been announced, but doubtless
Coach Maloney will give everyone on
the squad a chance to show what he
can do.
