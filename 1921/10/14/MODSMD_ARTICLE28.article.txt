# ANNUAL INTERCLASS SWIMMING MEET TO BE CLOSE CONTEST
## 
### 
The four classes are so evenly matched
that it is a tossup as to which one of
them will come out ahead in the an
nual interclass swim to be held next
Thursday afternoon, thinks Coach Ernie
Brandsten. Already the entry list of
every class is large and there will be no
event which will not be closely con
tested.
Final arrangements for the meet are
practically complete, according to Brand
sten. Teams have been chosen for the
relay, upon which a lot will probably
depend.
The seniors and the freshmen ought
to provide most of the thrills in the
final event. The former have six fast
men in Drake, Austin, Swett, Darling,
Thomas, and either Lacey, Morshead or
Phelps. The freshmen are more or less
of an unknown quality, but all of their
team, Hall, Myers, Mulgart, Klebahn.
Taylor and McAllister have made good
time in practice.
The sophmore relay team of Greppin,
Miller, Burdick, Hopper, Proctor and
Fletcher may prove to be the dark
horse. The junior team is composed of
Austin, Macconel, Harris, Barnett, Rob
inson and Brown. There are three of
the fastest men on the squad on the
third-year team, but the rest of the team
is considerably slower.
The events will consist of the 50 and
100-yard sprints, the 220, the 66-yard
back stroke, the 100-yard breast stroke,
diving, the plunge for distance and the
relay. Four places will be counted in
all events, the tally being for all except
the realy, 5, 3, 2 and 1. The relay will
count 10 for the winners, and 6, 4 and
2 for the other three places.
The class of 1923 won the interclass
swim last year by a good margin, but
the loss of several of the third-year men
makes them comparatively weak. Nine
teen hundred and twenty-four has a
well-balanced entry list and on past per
formances they should wrest first hon
ors from the seniors.
