# WELTON PAINTINGS FROM AUSTRALIA TO BE HUNG AT GALLERY
## 
### 
Tentative arrangements have been
made to have for the next exhibit at
the Stanford Art Gallery a collection of
paintings from Australia which were do
nated by Thomas Welton at his death.
These paintings will occupy the large
rear room while the two small rooms
will contain an exhibition by three Cali
fornia artists. If the arrangements are
completed the exhibition will begin No
vember 1.
The present collection is the regular,
art gallery exhibit which is put on
every summer, and contains many inter
esting paintings. James Giles. R. S. A.,
has several pictures, of which "Glen
Geldcr," "Stag and Hind," and "Kill
drummy Castle" are the most pleasing.
A charming little "Marine" by J. Hen
derson is reminscent of a portion of the
California coast near Carmel. The
smoky greyness of "A Russian Land
scape" by Bachman is relieved by a nar
row streak of color in the sunset and a
light in a cottage window. "Autumn
Frosts" by William Hart is a colorful
bit of the brightest season of the year.
The two pictures, "Tasmania," by the
two artists, Buvelot and Glover, are in
teresting because of the contrasts and
comparisons of the treatment of the
same subject by different men. "Ragged
Schoolboy" and "Blue Mountains of
New South Wales" are quite opposite in
subject matter but equally pleasing.
