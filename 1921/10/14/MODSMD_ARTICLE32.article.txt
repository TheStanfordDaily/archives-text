# FRESHMEN TO TOUR MEMORIAL CHAPEL WITH DR. GARDNER
## 
### 
Another feature of the "get on the
boat" movement which has been launched
for the benefit of the freshmen and new
students, is a tour of the Memorial
Chapel which will be conducted under
the direction of Dr. Gardner on Tues
day, Wednesday and Thursday of next
week. Owing to the size of the fresh
man class it has been divided into three
sections as follows: All whose names
come between A and li in tlie alphabet
will meet Tuesday at 4:45 in the vesti
bule of the Chapel; those whose names
come between F and I J will meet
Wednesday at 4. and those between Q
and Z will meet on Thursday at 4:45.
Dr. Gardner will explain the traditions
underlying the building of the Chapel,
and the significance of its outstanding
features, besides answering any ques
tions which the students care to ask.
