### 
Stockton high school will meet the
Cardinal freshmen eleven on the Stan
ford turf tomorrow morning at 10:30,
the game being played in the morning
to allow everyone an opportunity of see
ing both games. The game tomorrow
promises to be one of the best of the
preliminary season of. the Babe squad.
Stockton is touted to have a fast team
and in the preliminary games this year
the high school eleven has shown up ex
ceptionally well against the leading
teams of the bay region.
Several changes have been made in
the freshmen lineup during the week
and the Babes should play a stronger
game this week than was exhibited last
Saturday against Berkeley and Salinas.
In the games tomorrow against Stock
ton, Williams will start at the center
position, while Dickey will appear at left
end in the place of Janssen. Neil and
McKlofsky are Coach Seay's choice to
start at guards.
The regular backfield of Dennis, Gilli
laiul. Cuddeback and Howard, with Den
nis calling signals, is scheduled to start
while the tackles, who have been chosen
by Seay to break up the Stockton of
fense, are Dole and Sliipke. If Shipke
continues to play the brand of football
he displayed against the varsity during
the bleacher rally, he will bear watching
in the game with Stockton tomorrow.
Right end tomorrow will be filled by
Fuller with Janssen, Wideman and Ma
son to help out in a case of emergency.
Coach Seay and his staff will also have
Van Hook, Hayes and Helser to brace
up the freshmen line. On the sidelines
Hooper, Harris, McCrorie and Mc√üae
will be held in readiness to fill in in the
backfield.
