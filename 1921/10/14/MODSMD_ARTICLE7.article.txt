# VARSITY IS READY FOB OLYMPIC CLUB BATILE
## VAN GENT TO START LIGHTER LINE; MANY ON HOSPITAL LIST 
### 
The Stanford Varsity will go lip
against the powerful Olympic Club
eleven in San Francisco tomorrow with
at least two first string men on the hos
pital list.
That was the situation that Head
Coach Gene Van Gent faced tonight.
"Dud" De Groot, center, and Charlie
Helser, tackle, both vetrans from last
season, will both probably not be able
to get into the game. There is a chance
that two or three more of the varsity
men will be out of it.
The varsity practiced this afternoon
behind closed doors. Watchmen were
at the gates to sec that there were no
stray eyes peeping through knot holes.
The Cards will undoubtedly face one
of their hardest games of the season to
morrow. The Olympics have weaved to
gether a fast, heavy outfit that was good
enough to battle California off their feet
at least one period of the game and good
enough to throw back the offensive of
the "wonder team" three times within
the shadow of the goal posts.
Van Gent's lineup to start the game
is still a problem arid it seems to be a
question of who can guess the closest.
Either Faville or Ludeke will open up
at center, the odds seeming to favor the
latter. Faville broke into the St. Mary's
affair at guard and played a nice game.
"Red" Ketts and "Scotchy" Campbell
will probably start at the guards with
Stice ready to go in at any time. Car
ter, Douglas and Pershing look to be
the favorites for the tackle positions
with Sproul and Mertz on the wings.
"Swede" Larson has been working out
at left end this week as Mertz has had
his hand in splints. The "Swede" may
start the game.
The backfield will probably go in as it
started last week. Bob Shlaudeman is
slated to call the signals with Ray
Doughty and Art Wilcox at halfs and
Captain Jack Patrick at fullback.
The varsity has suffered greatly

through injuries this week, no less than
ten men being on the hospital list.
Mertz and Patrick have had their
hands in splints all week, Carter has an
injured back, Hey a strained knee,
Shlaudeman a charlev horse, Wilcox a
bad knee, Helser has been in bed all
week, De Groot has three csacked ribs
and Woodward has a strained back.
The game tomorrow will be played at
Ewing Field, and will be called at 3
o'clock.
