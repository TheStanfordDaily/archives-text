# TAUZER TO HEAD SKULL AND SNAKES
## Honor Society Plans to Make "S Wednesday" Custom; Sport Awards Standardized 
### 
C. J. Tauzer, '20, was elected head
of Skull and Snakes for the coming
year, at a meeting held last Thurs
day, in which several measures in re
gard to letters and numerals were
adopted.
The first of these will institute the
custom of "S Wednesday." On every
Wednesday, all men possessing "S"
sweaters will be expected to wear
them.
Hereafter, all sweaters, letters,
numerals, and other awards will be
standardized according to the differ
ent sports and the number of times
won, by a recommendation passed at
this meeting. This measure also does
away with the practice of placing nu
merals on the back of sweaters. The
recommendation, which was made by
the Student Manager and the Gradu
ate Manager, and passed by the Exe
cutive Committee, subject to the ap
proval of Skull and Snakes, is as fol
