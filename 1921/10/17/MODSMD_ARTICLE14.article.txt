# BENEFIT GARDEN PLAY IS DECIDED SUCCESS
## 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
"The Heart of Pierrot," presented for
the stadium fund in Castilleja garden
last Saturday noon, is one of the best
things which Stanford players could
have caused to happen since the last
free show. It was a tonic. Besides being
beautiful to witness in the deep greens
of the lawn and the oaks, which served
as background for a brilliantly colored
action, its ingredients, music, pantomine,
poetry and dance were distributed in as
nearly the perfect balance possible.
As a relief from the "magnificent of
fice set and unique lighting effect," the
sunshine poured down upon the orange
frocked bridesmaids and the blue figure
of the bride as they danced to the stray
tune of a wandering minstrel, casting
long shadows on the verdure which
there were no back stage pans to dis
tort. A great deal of credit is due
Chrysella Dunker who designed the cos
tumes. Miss Dunker and Dame Nature
got together the best scenery which the
campus will ever have the opportunity
of disregarding.
Chester Wing Barker, '18, is respon
sible for the music. Where some strains
closely approached tunes which the mu
sical world might have heard before,
the spirit was always with the action.
Dan W. Totheroh wrote the lines. It
was real poetry. Not that there was any
new message, the good old heart throb
that serves as the fifth reel for almost
every five-recler, who loves who and the
excuse was the core of the heart of
Pierrot. It was pleasing and with the
enthusiasm of the acting to stand be
hind it almost seemed new.
Les Seib and Frances Phillips led as
Pierrot and Pierrette. When Pierrette
could keep him away from the other
women and Tuscan stairs of pink mar
ble he was a good companion. Both
have good voices and did a pretty dance
beside their usually good acting. More
important was the introduction of pan
tonine in which the pair were quite
successful. Of course it was the best
pantonine the campus has ever attended,
for it was the first example, but the
idea seems worthy of a few more per
formances while there is such good ma
terial available.
Lady Chesterton, played by Augusta
Corey, was well done though not very
important, if dominating the scene means
anything. Donaldine Cameron, as her
daughter, merely had to appear to make
a big hit. She was in a blue costume, and
she sang and that is all that need he
said. The suspected reason why the
bridesmaids were in orange instead of
some dark color is because it was neces
sary for them to balance the attention
somehow.
The farmers, Lamson and James, ap
proached the amateur more nearly than
anyone else, but at that merely ap
proached it. Even the bear seemed pro
fessional, but that is because Arnold
Bayley was making the noises. Nelson
Valjean got the laugh where others
would have connected and held the
scenes up very efficiently after his line
was out.
Helen Whitney and Carrol Hudson
were the dancers of the traveling
players. They certainly looked well, but
that's admitting the prejudice. The
technique could have been anything,
though it comes to mind, it was very
good.
Business Manager Dills estimates that
the stadium fund is about $2(X) the
richer since the performance.
