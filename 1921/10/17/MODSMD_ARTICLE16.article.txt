# MIL GRIDMEN BEAT OLYMPICS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE RUGBY DAYS
## 7-0 SCORE FAILS TO TELL STORY OF DECISIVE VICTORY Stanford Team Outplays Wearers Of Winged "O" in All Phases of Saturday Game at Ewing Field 
### E. C. West, '23 
Battering the powerful Olympic Club team to defeat, 7 to 0, the Stanford
varsity Saturday did what a Cardinal team has been unable to do since
American football was resumed here.
It was a glorious Stanford victory. There was never a question as to
which team on the field was the better. And yet the Olympic team is the
same that held California to a 14 to 0 score.
An official of the winged "O" club said after the game that Van Gent
had placed the Stanford varsity on the football map this year.
It was the first time that a Cardinal team has played in San Francisco
since 1916.
Five years ago football followers left Ewing Field prasing a Stanford
team that had gone down to defeat gamely before a super rugby aggrega
tion. Saturday eight thousand fans left the bleachers praising a Cardinal
eleven that had proved its right to be ranked with the best of them.

Much of the credit for the Card vic
tory must be given to the line that
Van Gent put on the field.
On paper Stanford was weakened
by the loss of several stars, due to
injuries. But. there was no weakness
there Saturday. The Card offense was
vastly superior to that of the Olympics.
There were huge holes, through which
Patrick, Shlaudeman and Wilcox con
sistently advanced. On the defenso
the Olympic Club made first downs
exactly twice during the entire battle.
That tells the story of the Stanford
line.
Faville, unheard of as far as var
sity football material was concerned,
until two weeks ago, stood out at
center as one of the stars of the
afternoon.
Fred Ludeke, a huge fellow from
last year's freshman team, was down
on the list to "start." He started and
he finished. He broke up Olympic
Club plays before they were under
way, proved a tower of strength on
the offense and recovered two fumb
les by the club team both on the op
posite side of the line, from where
he was playing.
A Stanford team never played a
more perfect, machine-like game.
There was no fumbling, no mussing
up of plays. When the Cards had the
ball they usually advanced. When the
club team had it there was a stone
wall-defense for three plays and Dob
son would kick.
Captain Patrick was Stanford's
greatest ground gainer. He was al
ways good for yards when he took the
ball. He was in every play on the
defensive. And it was Patrick who
caught a beautiful forward pass from
"Bud" i Woodward, and carried the
oval across the goal line for the only
touchdown of the day. He was un
doubtedly the best man on the field.
The course of the game itself is the
tale of Stanford continually getting
into position to score with the Olym
pics always defending, defending, de
fending.
From the kick-off the Cards carried
the ball to mid-field and kicked far
into opposition territory. The club
men here made their only advance,
twice making yards. They were held
