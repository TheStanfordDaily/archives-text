# THE 						TURNING POINT
## 
### 
Stanford's decisive victory over the Olympic Club
last Saturday marks the turning point in the career
of the 1921 varsity. For the first time this season
the team performed as a unified machine. Evidence
of the high quality of coaching that Gene Van Gent
and his assistant coaches —Fitzgerald, Canning, and
Templeton —have been imparting to the Cardinal
pigskin warriors was displayed by the eleven in ac
tion against the clubmen.
Opinion following the contest was that Stanford
now has the strongest eleven that has represented
:he institution since the resumption of American foot
ball. Whether this is true will be shown in the diffi
cult games that remain to be played before the Big
Game. Certainly the team looked like a finished
product last Saturday. From now on it looks like
the task will be merely one of putting a final polish
on it.
The line which in the first two games was a con
stant source of worry to the coaches and a target
for the shots of the pessimistic among the under
graduates showed marked strength. The line ques
tion is not one of who can play in the line, but
who of the first-string linemen can be spared.
Saturday's contest showed that the Stanford play
ers have mastered the fundamentals of the Van Gent
system. Now they will be taught the finer points
and a greater variety of plays.
The drive for the Big Game starts from here,
•st real •stumbling block looms in the shape
'acifie Fleet eleven, which furnishes the com
next Saturday. Stanford has struck its
OH 1 v.iv^, tmd it is going to take a mighty fast aggrega
tion to stop it.
