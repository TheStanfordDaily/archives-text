# A
						REAL YELL TEST
## 
### 
Stanford students in attendance at the football
game in San Francisco Saturday and the Yell Lead
ers are to he commended on the fine showing made
hy the rooting section during the game. The fact
that many people who were not from Stanford were
seated in the Stanford section made organization
especially difficult. However the work of the Yell
Leader and his assistants in producing enthusiasm
and encouragement for the team was praiseworthy,
and the volume of yelling was not decreased because
of the broken section.

REVISION HAS BEEN MADE in the new song,
"Fight for Stanford," and the changed version will
be practiced by the students in the bleacher rally next
Wednesday. The Yell Leader urges that the stu
dents again fill the bleachers for the regular weekly
workout. There was a marked improvement in the
work of the rooters during the Olympic Club game
in San Francisco, but there is still plenty of good
hard work to be done before Stanford will be ready
to compete with the mammoth rooting section from
Berkeley in the new bowl on November 19. Every
yell practice will bring the bleacher display and
cheering for the Big Game that much closer to per
fection.
