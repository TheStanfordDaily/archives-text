See those eleven red-shirted guys? They're the birds
who put the limp in Olympic. Lo! Hear the gentle
mark!

We hate to crow be we have caws.

If getting set back fifteen yards every fifteen seconds
were a virtue, the varsity could have gone home in
high hats and frock coats. The umps certainly wielded
a mean penalizer.
* * #
Why should the Bears growl just because the Pacific
was Fleet?
w * #
That name of "Mound-bilders" is appropriate in more
ways than one. The bearers of the title at least acted
like cave-men.
• * # *
We see where a woman golf player told her caddie
to seek refuge in the hot climate, and then carried the
clubs herself. Spoken like a man, madame!
* * *
If the Limpics had painted a dollar sign on the foot
ball, they wouldn't have fumbled so much.
* * *
"I'm strong for you," said the home brew to the boot
legger.
* * *
After seeing the line-up in the city papers, we learn
of further football progress as a result of prowess,
brought about by an ex-center, now tackle, who is label
ed catcher.
* * *
What defeats our passive perception is the question
of whether the world series hounds are trying to subsi
dize football or are handing the effusive palm to the
star recoverer of fumbles.
* * *
We offer here a tentative line-up for the newly sub
sidized sport:
PATRICK —Backstop.
WILCOX—Left Field.
SHLAUDEMAN—High Jump.
WOODWARD—FIy Weight.
LUDEKE—Left Catcher.
CARTER —Right Catcher.
FAVILLE —Inside Five-eights.
CAMPBELL —Flying Guards.
DOUGLAS —Running Forward.
MERTZ—Right Relay.
SPROULL—East Wing.
Subs and Crips—Betts, first base; Doughty, tenor;
DeGroot, shot-put.
* * *
In Our Cabbage Patch
Some guys are naturally lucky,
Some guys get more than their due,
Some guys gobble the jackpots,
And all the little pots, too.
Some fellers get all of the pastry,
Some fellers can quit when they're through.
But when we're done, we've only begun,
Did it ever occur to you.
* * *
Last Friday's paper announces that the Stanford
Dames expected to increase their membership from
sixty to one hundred, soon. What matrimonial venture
have they up their sleeves?
* $ *
We lost too many women off our staff last year to
permit anything like that. We utter in protest the fol
lowing bromide:
Doing Their Bit
We once were Stanford co-eds,
But now we've lost our names,
We helped to boost the membership,
And now we're Stanford Dames.
* * *
At this point, the Chief Shoveler wrests the helm from
our grasp and steers the ship of state to disaster. Look
at the storm he's heading us into! Water, water, every
where and not a frosh to sink!
* * *
Andy Smith was observed to get up and walk rest
lessly two and froe, Saturday, when the navy team
scored on the Blew and Ghould. Goofy Gus prophesvs
that he had better get in a little track training prep
aratory to Nov. 19.
* * *
However, the real fight has just commenced. Appli
cations for seats have been mailed.
* * *
Banners at California declare, "There are no knot
holes in a stadium wall." Quite true. Anybody that
tries to dig a knothole in the Stanford Stadium had
better begin five years ago.
♦ * *
Games we would like to see: Stockton High vs.
Shredded Wheat Biscut Company; Pacific Fleet vs.
Professional Bouncers' Association; Saint Mary's vs.
Centre College (illustrating the power of prayer).
♦ ♦ ♦
Not having seen Will King over the weak-end, we
can't spring any second-hand jokes. It wouldn't be
any use anyway. Our contemporaries are experts at
that.
* * *
But that offer for that remarkible little volume bound
in half-calf still stands. Just so you don't send your
questions in on Monday.
* * *
History is all wrong. What Ben Franklin really said
was, "Late to bed and early rise, makes you unhealthy—
but—how're you going to hit the ex's otherwise?"
>•« # *
With the return of foggy weather it will probably be
hard to see thru the glimmers of Humor in this column.
We wish a cold snap would come and freeze the Cab
bage patch.
* * *
Anyway, Blue Monday is i.ow over, the Kabbages
have been washed out and dried, and for the rest of
the week brilliant shafts of wit pierce the paper
through this column.
* # H>
And that's not sarcasm. Sarcasm is cheap, and cab
bages rate high in the financial markets nowadays.

If getting set back fifteen yards every fifteen seconds

of whether the world series hounds are trying to subsi

We offer here a tentative line-up for the newly sub
sidized sport:
PATRICK —Backstop.
WILCOX—Left Field.
SHLAUDEMAN—High Jump.
WOODWARD—FIy Weight.
LUDEKE—Left Catcher.
CARTER —Right Catcher.
FAVILLE —Inside Five-eights.

DeGroot, shot-put.

In Our Cabbage Patch
Some guys are naturally lucky,
Some guys get more than their due,
Some guys gobble the jackpots,
And all the little pots, too.
Some fellers get all of the pastry,
Some fellers can quit when they're through.
But when we're done, we've only begun,
Did it ever occur to you.

Last Friday's paper announces that the Stanford
Dames expected to increase their membership from
sixty to one hundred, soon. What matrimonial venture
have they up their sleeves?

We lost too many women off our staff last year to
permit anything like that. We utter in protest the fol
lowing bromide:
Doing Their Bit
We once were Stanford co-eds,
But now we've lost our names,
We helped to boost the membership,
And now we're Stanford Dames.
* * *
At this point, the Chief Shoveler wrests the helm from
our grasp and steers the ship of state to disaster. Look
at the storm he's heading us into! Water, water, every

Andy Smith was observed to get up and walk rest
lessly two and froe, Saturday, when the navy team
scored on the Blew and Ghould. Goofy Gus prophesvs
that he had better get in a little track training prep

Banners at California declare, "There are no knot

Banners at California declare, "There are no knot
holes in a stadium wall." Quite true. Anybody that
tries to dig a knothole in the Stanford Stadium had
better begin five years ago.

Not having seen Will King over the weak-end, we

But that offer for that remarkible little volume bound

See those eleven red-shirted guys? They're the birds
who put the limp in Olympic. Lo! Hear the gentle

If getting set back fifteen yards every fifteen seconds
were a virtue, the varsity could have gone home in
high hats and frock coats. The umps certainly wielded
a mean penalizer.

Why should the Bears growl just because the Pacific

That name of "Mound-bilders" is appropriate in more
ways than one. The bearers of the title at least acted
like cave-men.

We see where a woman golf player told her caddie
to seek refuge in the hot climate, and then carried the
clubs herself. Spoken like a man, madame!

After seeing the line-up in the city papers, we learn
of further football progress as a result of prowess,
brought about by an ex-center, now tackle, who is label
ed catcher.

What defeats our passive perception is the question
of whether the world series hounds are trying to subsi
dize football or are handing the effusive palm to the
star recoverer of fumbles.

We offer here a tentative line-up for the newly sub
sidized sport:
PATRICK —Backstop.
WILCOX—Left Field.
SHLAUDEMAN—High Jump.
WOODWARD—FIy Weight.
LUDEKE—Left Catcher.
CARTER —Right Catcher.
FAVILLE —Inside Five-eights.
CAMPBELL —Flying Guards.
DOUGLAS —Running Forward.
MERTZ—Right Relay.
SPROULL—East Wing.
Subs and Crips—Betts, first base; Doughty, tenor;
DeGroot, shot-put.

In Our Cabbage Patch
Some guys are naturally lucky,
Some guys get more than their due,
Some guys gobble the jackpots,
And all the little pots, too.
Some fellers get all of the pastry,
Some fellers can quit when they're through.
But when we're done, we've only begun,
Did it ever occur to you.

Last Friday's paper announces that the Stanford
Dames expected to increase their membership from
sixty to one hundred, soon. What matrimonial venture
have they up their sleeves?
* $ *
We lost too many women off our staff last year to
permit anything like that. We utter in protest the fol
lowing bromide:
Doing Their Bit
We once were Stanford co-eds,
But now we've lost our names,
We helped to boost the membership,
And now we're Stanford Dames.

At this point, the Chief Shoveler wrests the helm from

Andy Smith was observed to get up and walk rest
