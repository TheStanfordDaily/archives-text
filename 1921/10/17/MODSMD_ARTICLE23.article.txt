# ALUMNI DIRECTORY AND TEN-YEAR BOOK IS NOW OFF PRESS
## 
### 
That Stanford University keeps in
close touch with its alumni is strikingly
brought out by the 696-page Alumni Di
rectory and Ten Year Book, which has
just been published under the supervi
sion of J. E. McDowell, alumni secre
tary of the University.
Up to last October, when the copy for
the book was turned in, Stanford had
graduated 6,515 men and women, and of
these only ninety-four individuals have
been lost on the records of the alumni
secretary. Three hundred and sixty
seven of the graduates have died.
The directory contains the names, ad
dresses, college year, war service record
and other data not only of these grad
uates, but also of all the men and women
who ever attended Stanford, so far as
the information could be obtained. Up
to the time of the completion of the di
rectory, 17,184 men and women had
matriculated at Stanford and of this
grand total all but 4,997 have been .lo
cated and their addresses appear in the
book. The name of every man and
woman who ever registered as a student
at Stanford is in the book, though for
these 4,997 there are deficiencies in tilt
data.
The inclusion of the non-graduates
is an innovation, and follows action of
the Stanford Alumni Association last
year making all former students eligi
ble, whether they received degrees or
not.
This is the third volume of the sort
published by the University, which is
sues such a directory every ten years.
It is being mailed now to more than
2.000 alumni who subscribed to it be
fore its publication.
