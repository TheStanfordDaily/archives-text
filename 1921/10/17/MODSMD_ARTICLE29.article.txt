# CALIFORNIA ELEVEN WINS FROM PACIFIC FLEET; SCORE 21-10
## 
### 
Coach Andy Smith's "wonder team"
went up against a hard proposition when
it tackled the Pacific Fleet eleven last
Saturday afternoon, but the Blue and
Gold walked off the field after the
fourth quarter with a 21 to 10 victory
tucked away.
Big Bill Ingram, former Annapolis
score, drew first blood for the navy
when he booted the ball over the cross
bar on a 20-yard place kick. California
went ahead shortly after when Toontey
and his injured foot got into the game
long enough to make a 35-yard run and j
a touchdown.
There was no further scoring until
the third quarter, when Nichols reeled
off 55 yards and brought the ball to
the Fleet's 2-yard line. After California
had made her last score, bringing the
count to 21 to 3, as a result of a fum
bled punt, Ingram and his sailors got
busy and marched down the held by
means of an aerial attack, ending up
behind the Bears' goal line.
Stephens took "Brick" Midler's place
at right end, but otherwise the Califor
nia line was intact. Erb at quarter,
Nichols and Bell at half, and Morrison
at fullback, composed the Blue and Gold
backfield.
