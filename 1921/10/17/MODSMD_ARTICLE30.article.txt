# SCHEDULE IS MADE FOR NET TOURNAMENT AT END OF DRAWING
## 
### 
Drawings for the singles and doubles
open tennis tournaments have been
made, and the first round is to be played
off before October 25. On account of
the great numbers wishing to use the
courts, only one set will be played in
the singles, although the full three will
be allowed to doubles contenders. It is
hoped to be able to play the finals on
the new courts now being finished, but
in the meantime the courts at present in
use are being fitted up with new nets.
Tournament matches will be played on
Tuesdays and Thursdays and Saturday
mornings, so as not to interfere with
the schedule of class matches. Sixty
two men have signed in the singles and
forty-eight in the doubles.

ment are as follows: Burchan vs. Hol
