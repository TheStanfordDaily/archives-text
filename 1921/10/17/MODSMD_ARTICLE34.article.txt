# Sequoia Sophomores Plan Frosh Smoker
## 
### 
Sophomores of Sequoia Hall have sot
aside Wednesday night as the date for
their smoker for the freshmen of the
hall. The second-year men have pro
vided a short program for the entertain
ment and instruction of the freshmen.
Words of advice will he handed out by
F. M. Kauffman, president of the class;
B. F. Haley, president of the hall, and
by the president of the Oval Club. A
fast round of boxing is promised the
spectators when "Slim" Chedister, 168
pounds, mixes with "Shorty" Enos, 98
pounds. Music of various sorts is also
to be given for the approval of the low
est classmen. William Strong has a pet
harmonica that he has trained for the
occasion; the Jazz Orchestra of the hall
has promised some numbers, and every
body will be given a chance to sing some
of the Stanford songs and yell a few
of the yells. The last number bids fair
to outdo all the others for popularity,
as the committee has promised some
"regular" eats for those present.
