# DR. JORDAN SAYS NIPPONESE STRONG FOR DISARMAMENT
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan has recently returned from I
Honolulu where he was sent by the!
United States government to preside
over the sessions of the Pan-Pacific
conference. These conferences are de
signed to be in the nature of neighbor- j
hood gatherings for those nations which
border on the Pacific ocean. The con- ;
ference began by discussing educational
questions, but soon shifted to the ques
tion of the disarmament conference as
the delegates felt that education is nse- '
less for peace. The Japanese and the
United States delegations were agreed
011 the policy of taking all the warships
and forts from the Pacific ocean. This
would make the situation in the Pacific
similar to that now existing between
the United States and Canada. In the
opinion of Dr. Jordan this will not be
done during the coming international
conference, but steps will be taken in
this direction.
The head of the Japanese delegation,
Baron Konda, is a close personal friend
of Dr. Jordan and shares his views on
the question of the day. Baron Konda
is also a professor in the Imperial Uni
versity in Tokio and is a member of the
delegation which will represent Japan
in the great disarmament conference to
be held in Washington soon.
According to Dr. Jordan, 95 per cent
of the Japanese and 75 per cent of the
Americans are looking for some way in
which to reduce the tremendous taxes
which they must pay as a result of wars,
past and future. It is said that if the
entire property of continental Europe
today were sold, it would barely pay
the debts of those nations.
While in Hawaii Dr. Jordan made a
collection of 300 varieties of fish. There
are some six or eight new kinds in
the collection. These fish will be shipped
to various museums in the United
States.
