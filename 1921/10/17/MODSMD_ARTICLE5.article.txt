# BABES OVERWHELM STOCKTON ELEVEN
## Freshmen Pierce Prep School Line at Will in 87-0 Game Here on Saturday Morning 
### C. H. Prior, '23 
The Stanford lirst-year men plowed
through the defense of the lighter Stock
ton High eleven and brought away the
fat end of an 87-0 score, in a lopsided
battle on the local turf Saturday morn
ing.
Cuddeback, with his consistent long
boots, and Howard and Wheat with
several spectacular runs to their credit,
stood out as the stars of the game. The
prep school gridmen were held in their
tracks so successfully by Seay's proteges
that it was difficult to decide who de
served the leading role in their lineup.
Within the first minute of play, and
before the high school lads knew what
was going on, Howard circled left end
for the first touchdown and Dennis con
verted. Stockton pulled down Citdde
back's first long boot and started their
offensive machine on their 10-yard line,
but the Freshman line held like a stone
wall so the visitors gave up and kicked
to the middle of the field. The elusive
Howard slipped through the Stockton
defense again and sprinted fitfy yards
for the second touchdown. Dennis
kicked goal.
Cuddeback sent the sphere to the visi
tors' two-yard lint and Dissausois ran
the ball back to the 15-yard line. Stock
ton messed a pass, lost 10 yards on an
end run, fumbled 011 the next play, and
Janssen fell on the ball for a touch
down. Dennis kicked goal. Cuddeback
kicked to the Stockton goal line, Sousa
ran it back to the 28-yard line, and the
prep offensive battered at the stone wall
again to no avail.' Gilliland, Cuddeback
and Howard smashed through for con
sistent gains, Howard taking the ball
over for the fourth touchdown. Dennis
failed to kick goal. This was the last
tally of the quarter and the Babes had
the ball on the visitors' 35-yard line
when the gun fired. Wheat replaced
Dennis at quarter and Carey went in
for Howard at left half.
The second quarter was a mild re
petition of the first with two more tallies
for the Babes. Cuddeback had been
sending his long spirals into Stockton
territory for an average of 50 yards and
toward the end of the half made a spec
tacular boot from his own 35-yard line,
-sending the ball well back of the Stock
ton goal. At the gun the score stood
40-0.
Seay started a general shake-up in his
puoDOs Dip jo SuiuuiSaq aqi ju auitpiuu
half and before the final gun he had
given almost every first-string man a
chance. Wheat, Carey, Cooper and Mc-
Corie were the new backfield. The Babes
kicked off to Stockton's 10-yard line and,
with the idea of gaining any yardage
