# Commuters to Elect Conference Members
## 
### 
Tomorrow noon the Stanford women
commuters will meet at the clubhouse
on the campus to elect two representa
tives to women's confcrcnce. This group
of women students lias not hitherto been
represented on the governing body of
the five hundred, although the constitu
tion entitles them to such representation.
Tt is the hope of the present conference
that by putting into effect this provision
of the constitution all of the living
groups and the women at large may be
fairly represented, and that a spirit of
common interest and cooperation may be
stimulated in the conference Tifld in the
activities of the women students.
