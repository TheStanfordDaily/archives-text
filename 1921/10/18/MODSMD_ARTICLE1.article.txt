# COACH TALKS AT ASSEMBLY GIVEN FOR '25 CLASS
## Freshmen Practice Yells and Songs Under Direction of Connolly; New Song Tried 
### 
Unrestrained "pep" and enthusiasm
reigned supreme at the Assembly Hall
last night when members of the fresh
man class got together to listen to a
talk by Duffy Seay, coach of the fresh
man football eleven, and to learn the
Stanford songs and yells. It was the
second of a series of "on the boat" as
semblies held under the auspices of the
Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A., and the
Associated Students.
Seay, speaking of the Stanford tradi
tions, told the first-year men, "There is
one tradition I would like to see disap
pear, and that is the tradition that the
Stanford freshmen should always be
beaten by the California freshmen in
football. I have searched the records
and not oncc have 1 found a sign of a
Stanford freshman victory."
Seay discussed briefly the freshman
football prospects. "The class of 1925
has a good chance to break that tradi
tion," he said "The California fresh
men are strong, and it is going to be a
hard fight, but the football squad is
working hard. It is going to take the
support of every member of the student
body to put it over."
The greater part of the time was de
voted to practicing Stanford songs and
yells under the direction of "Bob" Con
nolly, head yell leader. The crowd made
up for what it lacked in numbers by
showing a vast amount of enthusiasm
per square inch, and the vocal organs of
most of the first-year men were im
paired before the rally was half over.
Particular attention was given to
'.'Fight for Stanford," the new bleacher
song which will be used a great deal
this year. Connolly kept the crowd at
it until they knew the march by heart.
"The Cardinal Is Waving" was another
song which was introduced to the first
year class. Words of the songs and
yells were flashed upon the screen, while
C W. Midgeley, '23, played the airs on
the piano.
Minsky and Douglas, the newly elect
ed yell leaders, were on hand and as
sisted Connolly in the arm waving.
