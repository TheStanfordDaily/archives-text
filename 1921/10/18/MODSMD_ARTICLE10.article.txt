# Penniless Bruins Seek Box Car DeLuxe Rates
## 
### 
Berkeley, Cal., Oct. 18.â€”Enthusiastic
but fundless, a group of California stu
dents have put in an application to the
Southern Pacific railroad for regular
'ho rates, ala box car de luxe, in order
to see the California-Washington state
game in Portland.
The only condition is that the "pri
vate car" be delivered safe and whole
some on the morning of October 29.
Needless to say the railroad company
is puzzled as just what to do in regard
to this novel request, as their books
show no rates for "human freight."
