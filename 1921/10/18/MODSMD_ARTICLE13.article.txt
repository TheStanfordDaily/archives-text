The time-honored and unique cele
bration of the men of Encina Hall, the
annual pajama pee-rade, is scheduled
for Wednesday evening at 7 :30 o'clock,
at which hour the men of the hall will
venture forth into outer atmosphere
clad in the raiments of the night, and
will make their hasty visits over the
established route.
The fastest of the freshmen will be
dispatched in the advance guard, light
ing colored torches which will illuminate
the way for the thousand men behind,
all the way from Encina to Roble, over
the sorority steps and home again. Those
who might be unduly astounded at the
vestments of the Encina Club members
venture forth during the pee-rade at
their own peril.
Committees at the hall are perfecting
the arrangements for the event, which
all expect to be as successful as those
pajama pee-rades of former years.
