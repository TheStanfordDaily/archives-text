# "TAILOR MADE MAN" ONE OF BROADWAY'S LATEST SUCCESSES
## 
### 
After two years 011 Broadway and
one more 011 the road, "The Tailor-
Made Man" has been finally released
for amateur development and obtain
ed by Coach Davis for Sword and
Sandals. When the show is put on
the Assembly Hall boards 011 the 28th
it will be one of the earliest amateur
stagings of the comedy.
The author, H. J. Smith, one of New
York's theatrical leaders, is respons
ible for the success of more shows
than any other man, perhaps, for
whenever a potential hit shows signs
of snoozing off, Smith is sent for to
feed it some of his jucular tonic. Re
side the humor for which the play
doctor is responsible, the fact that
George M. Cochran has handled it,
means that his touch will be evident
in the snap and fire of action.
There is a cast of thirty-one peo
ple. That, in itself, assures success
from the viewpoints of the boxoffice.
Figuring each character at two rela
tives and six friends, at least, there
will be 2SB tickets sold. That will do
away with all doubts and hesitancy
011 the part of the dancers who con
template staying home because there
won't be any life at the dance after
wards. With Palo Alto devotees, a
smattering of snakes and the compli
mentary representation is added it
looks as if it would pay those who
wish to see a good show to get their
tickets early.
Laughter abounds. The reputation
itself proves it. Not until three years
after the writing has an amateur com
pany been able to get the privilege
of production at any royalty. Its
latest appearance on the coast was
in Los Angeles, where a stock com
pany has been playing the comedy
during the greater part of the sum
mer. This is unfortunate, Coach Davis
said yesterday, not so much because
a large number of Stanford people
come from the visinity, for the show
is good enough to see several tomes,
but because the company which put
it on wos so poor.
Needless to say, the "Tailor Made
Man" will be made right on October
28th.
In rehearsal, the cast shows that,
they fit into the roles they are slated
for, which is the most that can be
told so early in the game. A great
difficulty is being slowly overcome as
the characters continue to read the
numerous dialects. German, Scotch,
and three or four varieties of upper
strata society jargon as well as
cockney and an assumption of French,
are serving as stumbling blocks. Davis
is confident that the accents will all
be trantable 011 the final night, as the
progress of throttling the American
tongue is proceeding encouragingly.
Act two will be rehearsed tonight,
in the Assembly Hall, from 7 to 10
o'clock.
