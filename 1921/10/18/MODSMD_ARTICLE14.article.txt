# "TAILOR MADE MAN" ONE OF BROADWAY'S LATEST SUCCESSES
## 
### 
After two years 011 Broadway and
one more 011 the road, "The Tailor-
Made Man" has been finally released
for amateur development and obtain
ed by Coach Davis for Sword and
Sandals. When the show is put on
the Assembly Hall boards 011 the 28th
it will be one of the earliest amateur
stagings of the comedy.
The author, H. J. Smith, one of New
York's theatrical leaders, is respons
ible for the success of more shows
than any other man, perhaps, for
whenever a potential hit shows signs
of snoozing off, Smith is sent for to
feed it some of his jucular tonic. Re
side the humor for which the play
doctor is responsible, the fact that
George M. Cochran has handled it,
means that his touch will be evident
in the snap and fire of action.
There is a cast of thirty-one peo
ple. That, in itself, assures success
from the viewpoints of the boxoffice.
Figuring each character at two rela
tives and six friends, at least, there
will be 2SB tickets sold. That will do
away with all doubts and hesitancy
011 the part of the dancers who con
template staying home because there
won't be any life at the dance after
wards. With Palo Alto devotees, a
smattering of snakes and the compli
mentary representation is added it
looks as if it would pay those who
wish to see a good show to get their
tickets early.
Laughter abounds. The reputation
itself proves it. Not until three years
after the writing has an amateur com
pany been able to get the privilege
of production at any royalty. Its
latest appearance on the coast was
in Los Angeles, where a stock com
pany has been playing the comedy
