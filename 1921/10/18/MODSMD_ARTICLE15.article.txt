# BRITAIN'S POLITICIANS ARE DISCUSSED BY HIRST
## 
### 
"It would not surprise me if Lord
Robert Cecil was the next prime min
ister of England." said Professor
Francis W. Hirst, in his lecture on
Lloyd George, and his colleagues, at
the Little Theatre, yesterday after
noon. He said that Lord Cecil has
real moral character and conviction
on his principles, a thing which seems
rare in British political circles today.
Professor Hirst then went on to give
a brief description of the leading men
in England today.
He described Asquith as a very bril
liant and pithy speaker. He quoted
him as saying, when asked about the
Irish question, "the gas is out of the
bag." Asquith is the leader of the op
position party in the house, which is,
however, not very strong.
Lord Beecham was characterized as
the leader of the opposition in the
House of Lords. He is a speaker of
the old school, and presents a very
striking figure in the House.
"The Labor party has some sixty
members in Parliament, but they are
not very active," Professor Hirst con
tinued. "Mr. Cline at. present seems
to be at the head but he lacks courage.
There are two types of labor leaders.
Arthur Henderson who is a famed
Sunday afternoon speaker, is one type.
The other is the radical socialist.

Neither type is very popular in Eng
land at the present time."
Lord Gray, although known as a
member of the opposition to Lloyd
George's coaliiion, it= really not very
ictive, accrrding t.n Professor Hirst.
He has accepted a commission to
America from tlio administration.
The other influence on political
parties that Mr. Hirst spoke upon
were what he called the "Schools of
Thought Groups." Although these
groups have little real part in the po
litical field they have several very
prominent men. Lord Morley and
Lord Bryce are the most important
men in the dominating group.
The Marquis of Landsdown and
Lord Rosebcrry are other men who
hold an important position Jn the
other groups, Professor Hirst stated.
Professor Hirst drew pictures of
some of the other figures in national
life. He spoke highly of John Burns,
the unionist lender, who has risen from
a day laborer. He called attention
to the work of the threo Jews in the
present cabinet and sketched the char
acter of Lord George Hamilton.
Professor Hirst gives these lectures
under the auspices of the Political
Science Club. He has had a very per
sonal acquaintance with the men of
whom he speaks. He is the editor of
"Common Sense" and "The Econo
mist," and was a British delegate to
the Peace Conference.

liant and pithy speaker. He quoted
him as saying, when asked about the
Irish question, "the gas is out of the
bag." Asquith is the leader of the op
position party in the house, which is,
however, not very strong.
Lord Beecham was characterized as
the leader of the opposition in the
House of Lords. He is a speaker of
the old school, and presents a very
striking figure in the House.
"The Labor party has some sixty
members in Parliament, but they are
not very active," Professor Hirst con
tinued. "Mr. Cline at. present seems
to be at the head but he lacks courage.
There are two types of labor leaders.
Arthur Henderson who is a famed
Sunday afternoon speaker, is one type.
The other is the radical socialist.

Neither type is very popular in Eng
land at the present time."
Lord Gray, although known as a
member of the opposition to Lloyd
George's coaliiion, it= really not very
ictive, accrrding t.n Professor Hirst.
He has accepted a commission to
America from tlio administration.
The other influence on political
parties that Mr. Hirst spoke upon
were what he called the "Schools of
Thought Groups." Although these
groups have little real part in the po
litical field they have several very
prominent men. Lord Morley and
Lord Bryce are the most important
men in the dominating group.
The Marquis of Landsdown and
Lord Rosebcrry are other men who
hold an important position Jn the
other groups, Professor Hirst stated.
Professor Hirst drew pictures of
some of the other figures in national
life. He spoke highly of John Burns,
the unionist lender, who has risen from
a day laborer. He called attention
to the work of the threo Jews in the
present cabinet and sketched the char
acter of Lord George Hamilton.
Professor Hirst gives these lectures
under the auspices of the Political
Science Club. He has had a very per
sonal acquaintance with the men of
whom he speaks. He is the editor of
"Common Sense" and "The Econo
mist," and was a British delegate to
the Peace Conference.
