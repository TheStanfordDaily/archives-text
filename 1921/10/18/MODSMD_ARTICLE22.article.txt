# TYPICALLY STANFORD

### 
Stanford's stadium stands today a realityâ€”so
real that when looking into the bowl from the top
of the embankment you are forced to wonder if your
eyes are deceiving you. It has been termed a monu
ment to Stanford enterprise, it is more than that.
It embodies the spirit that is always typical of this
institution, the spirit of co-operaion and quiet ac
complishment. There is a remerkable story behind
this achievement that typifies Stanford.
Shortly after the college year began last Octo
ber someone thought aloud that it would be nice if
Stanford had a stadium. The University of Wash
ington had just completed the first stadium on the
Pacific Coast and was preparing to stage its football
battles in it. Stadiums were beginning to be the
subject of talk in several of the western universities.
Stanford's Board of Athletic Control started
to investigate matters. Data were collected from
eastern institutions and from the north, and engi
neers were set to figuring costs and location. To
the outsider it was just a project that might be
realized after several years.
Then the announcement was made on Decem
ber 2 that Stanford was to build a bowl. It was to
cost $750,000 and would be built of concrete, to
seat 60,000. Stanford engineers had evolved a new
plan in which by means of embankment and exca
vation a bowl of concrete could be constructed which
would care for an enormous crowd. Excavation
was to start in the summer of 1921, the ground was
to be allowed to settle and harden, and the bowl
would be ready for the 1923 Big Game.
Somehow that idea, while receiving the whole
hearted support of faculty, alumni, and students,
*d vaeue; 1923 was a long way off, and
;d up over something that
>rking quietly, the officials
>ard of Athletic Control,
and the Engineering Commission soon startled the
awakening public with another announcement. The
.stadium was to be built of wood and at a cost of
only $210,000. Construction would be started im
mediately, as would a drive for funds.
Both sides of the project were started simul
taneously. A force of men appeared on the site
selected and began blasting trees. Leland Cutler,
of the Board of Athletic Control, and Joseph Hic
key, campaign manager, started blasting funds from
the willing pockets of alumni, students, and the
public.
1 he explosive used by the campaign managers
was of quite a different nature from that used in
clearing the site, however. There was no startling
detonation, but the explosive admittedly had force.
For each subscription of $100 a person was given
the privilege of buying the best pair of seats for the
Big Games at either Berkeley or Stanford for ten
years. The money which was to be used primarily
in the construction of the bowl was eventually to be
turned into a scholarship fund, or to some other like
purpose to be designated by the donor. There was
no molasses to attract the speculative and the "I
want-full-value" subscriber. There was no mort
gage placed on future Stanford athletics.
The plan met with whole-souled response every
where. Within the first few weeks of the campaign
enough money was raised to guarantee the contrac
tors, who then moved in with a force of men, three
elevating graders, an army of mules and a few
dozen Fresno scrapers.
That was last June. When the last student had
passed the stadium site on the way home for the
summer there were merely a few mounds of dirt
outlining the form the bowl was to take. October 1
returning students were awed by the sight that
greeted their eyes. In place of a few scattered piles
of dirt they saw one long embankment in the form
of a horseshoe. Up the outside ran stairways, down
the inside were row upon row of seats, and at the
very bottom a leveled field where the future fortunes
of Stanford athletic teams will be fought out.
That is the simple story of the building of the
Stanford bowl. Simple, yes, in the telling. Now
that the stadium is almost ready the hard work is
being forgotten. That is human nature, to bend
every effort and to strain every muscle to achieve,
and then, when the consummation is realized, to
forget.
There it stands, a monument to Stanford spirit
of co-operation and modest achievement. It is
ready for dedication by the greatest football eleven
Stanford has had since the relegation of rugby to
the scrap heap.
