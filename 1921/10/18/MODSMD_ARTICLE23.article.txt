# WANTON DESTRUCTION
## 
### 
Saturday night in the dim dark hours some
member or members of the male portion of the
student body thought to emulate the hacking scene
from George Washington. The marauders attacked
an apparently inoffensive tree in the vicinity of La
suen and the county road, and as they wielded a
hefty ax considerable damage was done to it. it
takes ordinarily ten or fifteen years for a tree to
grow to full maturity, but in ten minutes this work
of several college generations was undone.
This kind of enthusiasm and vigor is all right
in its place, but the campus is not the place for the
carving of lasting initials in the trees. The place
to swing the axe is in the face of the Golden Grizzly
at an early date, and not among the beauteous foli
age bearers of the University grounds.
