We feel all fussed up in our new garden and look
forward to one of the best crops of the well-known
vegetable in our experience this week. We even
startled a few sleeping beauties into a communicatory
mood. One pair of eggs asked so many questions, they
must have thought this was the Inflammation Bureau.
A sample of their wares follows.

If it tages a mosquito an hour and a half to bore a
hole through a brick, how long will it take an elephant
wearing a pair of boxing gloves to pick a flea off his
ear?
* * *
Answer: —An hour and a half. When the mosquilo
gets through with the brick, he bites the elephant, who
then shimmies and shakes the ilea off. If you don't
believe, ask the next Elephant-Eating Mosquito.

Question: —If all the alarm clocks in Encina Hall
went off at once, would it be a coincidence?
* * *
Answer: —No. It would be Encina Hall still.
* * *
Question: —It is true that revival meetings are being
held in the Hoo-Hoo House?
* * #
Answer: —No. We always have to be revived after
we leave.

These inquisitive gence, Jzzy and Mike, who asked
the above questions, took a couple of personal cracks
at ye sacred colyum. Our editorial policy prohibits the
publication of the remainder of their communication.

Among those missing (upstairs) is the gent who
flopped off the ancient cavalry steed yesterday in an
attempt to ride the animule for two-bits. He got the
cash along with the laugh and the air.
* * *
Looks as if we were going to be forced to furnish the
postage stamps to inviegle readers into contributing
to this word fund. Just think of the poor, starving
rutabagas!

If you are in trouble—We'll get you out of it. If you
have a question—We'll answer it. If you know a joke
—We'll print it. If you write verse—We'll run it. But
if you come in the office and try to tell it to us—We'll
beat it. Be a booster! Patronize the P. O.

At this point, the Tuesday Despatcher takes his Rem
ington in hand and proceeds to call a few signals. The
first is an incomplete pass.

Monday is nothing to the Gunner but joy. It's the
dark blue night of the nation's wash day, that sees the
production of these gems. Maybe that is why they're so
clean.

It's just as Damon said to Pythias, "I know she's a
clean girl, because I saw the soap behind her ears."
* * *
I turned that one in last year so I know it wasn't
printed.

Let loose the seats, men. It may be said of Cab
bages that it had the limp put in Olympic, had the
ruin slated for Bruin, but before they are immortalized
by this column, this part of it declares against any
more bum puns on the peacefulness of Pacific. It's
enough to make the footbawl. (See Chappie file for
last year).
* * *
Football may be a fertile field for growing jokes but
one more prcaution is necessary before the season gets
too far along. Let none of the myriad contributors
make a pass at fame by attempting to perpetuate the
squib about the substitute who says he plays left-out.
OUT!

The below should be heartily laughed at, if only for
the reason that it was a contribution. To wit: "The
hardy engineer bewaileth traditional laxity. Things
cannot be left on Quad sills. He left a cigar's corpse
on window sill and an hour later found it —gone.
Question for class: By whom was cigarette.

Just Like a Chicken
There was a young Stanford professor,
Who purchased a chicken —God bless 'er.
She wanted some stew.
But away the hen flew.
When professor tried to undress 'er.
* * *
"Alas, there's a price on my head," said the Cabbage
in the market place.

When Was This?
There once was a young Stanford scholar,
Who queened six times on a dollar,
He said it was ample,
To set an example,
For all of the others to foller.
U TELLEM, RAIN, YOU'VE GOT THE PATTER!
