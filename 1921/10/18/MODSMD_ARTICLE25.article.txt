# CAMPUS MENAGERIE INCLUDES PETS FROM SPIDERS TO SNAKES
## 
### 
An alligator, a turtle, a wild cat, a
goat, a tarantula, a snake and numerous
dogs, cats and birds compose the menag
erie that is rapidly becoming one of the
sights of interest on the Stanford cam
pus. If one wishes to know the loca
tion of this menagerie he may spend j
a little time by journeying to many of
the local living groups, where the above
named creatures are considered as pets.
If the sightseer lacks time it would '■
pay him to first visit the Gamma Phi
Beta house which wins first honors for
the largest collection of pets, which is
made up of three canaries, known as
Gamma. Phi, and Beta, respectively. This
group is also the proud possessor of
"Billy," a goat, which may be seen not
very far from the house. In addition,
this house has the honor of owning the
smallest pet of the campus, namely a
tarantula, captured several weeks ago
by one of the co-eds near Woodside.
Due to the hunting skill of a Mr.
Whiteford the Alpha Tau Omega house
has a linx cat which keeps all strangers
away. The cat was caught in the hills
near Santa Maria, and may be seen in
a specially constructed cage on one of
the porches. It has been given the name
"Lux."
The Kappa Alpha house claims to
have a real spotted frog snake which
measures about five feet in length. It is
kept either in the basement or on the
second iloor. Rumor has it that another
sorority house had a "snake" for a
short while last spring. It was cap
tured by one of the underclass members
near the Library.
With the disappearance of Roscoe Ar
buclcle, a turtle measuring one foot in
diameter, the Phi Kappa Sigmas lost
their only pet. It is feared that the
animal has gone to new quarters where
it will be known under a new name.
This turtle was captured on a desert by
one of the members.
"Debs," an alligator, was given a most
pompous funeral a few weeks ago by
the members of the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon house. This pet had been sent from
Florida by a former member of the
house and was highly prized by all. Last
winter the alligator was kept in the
basement hut this spring a cement pool
was provided for him in the garden. He
lived in the pool until some adventurous
canine of the campus saw fit to bring
"Debs'" life to an end. The alligator
measured about ten inches in length.
"Rhubarb," a light brown cat, is con
sidered the pet at the Chi Omega house,
while the Delta Delta Deltas also have
a cat which they have christened "Ome
ga." Last spring the Sigma Kappa ac
quired a yellow cat as their mascot.
El Toro Club has as a mascot a dog
called "Lucky." This animal was found
one morning by the Chinese cook on the
doorstep of the club's quarters and has
been guarded by all the members very
carefully. "Pooch" is another campus
canine that claims his permanent resi
dence as the Phi Kappa Psi house. The
Delta Tau Delta house has recently ac
quired a bulldog known as "Spike,"
which formerly registered at the Uni
versity of Chicago, but seems more than
delighted with the "Farm."
The Beta Theta Pi house believe that
they own a tan bulldog who answers to
the name of "Beep," but of late the dog
has taken up temporary residence at
the Phi Delta Theta and Delta Gamma
houses. "Beep" is conspicuous for his
pleasant ( ?) facial expression. The Al
pha Phi house possesses a very sociable
Airdale dog which the co-eds call "Bob."
The large, black German police dog
often seen about the campus is owned
by the members of the Theta Xi house
and is known by all as "Damn-it." His
disposition does not justify his name.

With the disappearance of Roscoe Ar
buclcle, a turtle measuring one foot in
diameter, the Phi Kappa Sigmas lost
their only pet. It is feared that the
animal has gone to new quarters where
it will be known under a new name.
This turtle was captured on a desert by
one of the members.
"Debs," an alligator, was given a most
pompous funeral a few weeks ago by
the members of the Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon house. This pet had been sent from
Florida by a former member of the
house and was highly prized by all. Last
winter the alligator was kept in the
basement hut this spring a cement pool
was provided for him in the garden. He
lived in the pool until some adventurous
canine of the campus saw fit to bring
"Debs'" life to an end. The alligator
measured about ten inches in length.
"Rhubarb," a light brown cat, is con
sidered the pet at the Chi Omega house,
while the Delta Delta Deltas also have
a cat which they have christened "Ome
ga." Last spring the Sigma Kappa ac
quired a yellow cat as their mascot.
El Toro Club has as a mascot a dog
called "Lucky." This animal was found
one morning by the Chinese cook on the
doorstep of the club's quarters and has
been guarded by all the members very
carefully. "Pooch" is another campus
canine that claims his permanent resi
dence as the Phi Kappa Psi house. The
Delta Tau Delta house has recently ac
quired a bulldog known as "Spike,"
which formerly registered at the Uni
versity of Chicago, but seems more than
delighted with the "Farm."
The Beta Theta Pi house believe that
they own a tan bulldog who answers to
the name of "Beep," but of late the dog
has taken up temporary residence at
the Phi Delta Theta and Delta Gamma
houses. "Beep" is conspicuous for his
pleasant ( ?) facial expression. The Al
pha Phi house possesses a very sociable
Airdale dog which the co-eds call "Bob."
The large, black German police dog
often seen about the campus is owned
by the members of the Theta Xi house
and is known by all as "Damn-it." His
disposition does not justify his name.
An alligator, a turtle, a wild cat, a
goat, a tarantula, a snake and numerous
dogs, cats and birds compose the menag
erie that is rapidly becoming one of the
sights of interest on the Stanford cam
pus. If one wishes to know the loca
tion of this menagerie he may spend j
a little time by journeying to many of
the local living groups, where the above
named creatures are considered as pets.
If the sightseer lacks time it would '■
pay him to first visit the Gamma Phi
Beta house which wins first honors for
the largest collection of pets, which is
made up of three canaries, known as
Gamma. Phi, and Beta, respectively. This
group is also the proud possessor of
"Billy," a goat, which may be seen not
very far from the house. In addition,
this house has the honor of owning the
smallest pet of the campus, namely a
tarantula, captured several weeks ago
by one of the co-eds near Woodside.
Due to the hunting skill of a Mr.
Whiteford the Alpha Tau Omega house
has a linx cat which keeps all strangers
away. The cat was caught in the hills
near Santa Maria, and may be seen in
a specially constructed cage on one of
the porches. It has been given the name
"Lux."
The Kappa Alpha house claims to
have a real spotted frog snake which
measures about five feet in length. It is
kept either in the basement or on the
second iloor. Rumor has it that another
sorority house had a "snake" for a
short while last spring. It was cap
tured by one of the underclass members
near the Library.
