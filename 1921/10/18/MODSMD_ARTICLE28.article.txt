# ENTHUSIASM KEEN AS HANDBALL PLAY OPENS
## 
### 
Drawings in the singles and doubles '
handball tournaments have already been
made and play has now started. Ow ing j
to the short time which the entry list for
these tourneys were kept open, not all of
the handball enthusiasts are entered, but j
from the schedule drawn up there
should be some hot matches on the En- j
cina gym courts.
In the doubles tournament, which is ;
for organization, Mulryan and Maier,
off-campus, ought to furnish the prin-1
cipal excitement when they run up
against Rutter and Reticker, represent
ing Delta Chi. The latter won the lien
ors in the tournament last year.
In the singles there are many entries
and it is difficult to predict who will
emerge triumphant. On the basis of
past performances, the final contests
should be between Balcker, Rutter and
Maier, although there are several men
who are likely to give these three a hard
tussle.
All matches in the first round must
be played by Saturday, October 22. It
is up to the men to arrange with their
opponents as to when the contests shall
be played.
