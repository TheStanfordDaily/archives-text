Tha next issue of the Pictorial Re
view, which will be on sale the first
week of next month, will be featured
by some unusual pictures, coupled with [
articles by prominent Stanford men and
graduates, according to an announce
ment given out yesterday by E. E.
Crowe, editor.
The most striking football action pic
tures that the campus has seen in re
[ cent times will, it is promised, be shown
in the pictorial section. They were taken
by C. S. Draper, photographic editor,
and are said to he truly remarkable. Be
sides this there will he a photographic
"Who's Who," showing prominent men
of the campus in characteristic poses,
and other pictures will complete the
photographic section.
Up-to-date "dope" on the football sit
uation will be furnished in an article
by Shelley Pierce, '21. B. C. Wohlford,
member of Press Club and former edi
tor of Chaparral, will contribute an ar
ticle on the comparative strictness of
Stanford scholarship as against the East
ern universities. Wohlford has just re
turned from Harvard, and in his article
shows that Stanford is decidedly not
any harder to get through than are the
Eastern institutions. Art Harzfeld, '21,
| ex-editor of Chaparral, reviews an ar
ticle by Milt Hagen, '15, which appeared
in a recent number of the "Billboard,"
praising the results achieved in Stanford
dramatics. "Why Are College Women
Not Beautiful?", a question under which
an article appeared in a recent issue of
Photoplay, is taken up by Herb Mar
schutz, ex-'l7. Other articles will round
out the "issue.
A call for tryoutees for the Pictorial
editorial staff has been issued. Every
one who wishes to write on topics of
interest, especially expressing student
opinion, for the magazine should see
E. E. Crowe, '21. All material must be
in by the 22d. Successful tryoutees will
probably be announced in the issue after
this one. The written material should lie
sent to Box 618, Stanford Pictorial.
Tryoutees for the photographic staff
of the Pictorial should report to C. S.
Draper, '21.
