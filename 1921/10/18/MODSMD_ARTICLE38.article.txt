# DR. JORDAN PRAISES COSMOPOLITAN CLUB IN WELCOME ADDRESS
## 
### 
"Every country has in the past painted
every other country blackâ€”the Cosmo
politan Clubs, by uniting the students of
the nations throughout the world, will
help to prevent their painting each other
black in the future." This was the idea
expressed by Dr. Jordan in his address
of welcome to the new students at the
Cosmopolitan Club meeting held in the
Women's Clubhouse last night. By pro
viding a meeting place for the students
of different nationalities, said Dr. Jor
dan, the petty hates and misunderstand
ings of ignorance are avoided. It was
due to the influence of men with a cos
mopolitan turn of mind, he said, that
the disarmament conference at Wash
ington was called.
Dr. Jordan related the proceedings of
the recent conference held in Honolulu,
in regard to Pacific problems, and told
of making the Pacific an unarmed ocean,
similar to the Great Lakes on the Cana
dian border. He also told of the his
tory of Cosmopolitanism through the
world, and of his founding of the club
here at Stanford.
Kenneth Gagos opened the entertain
ment end of the program with a saxo
phone solo. K. T. Chu then gave some
demonstrations of clever Chinese sleight
of hand. Spanish folk songs on the steel
guitar were given by Louis De Souza.
and Ruth Davis sang several numbers
accompanied by Araxie Vartanian, with
a violin obligato by Meribeth Cameron.
During the serving of the refreshments
Jack Hefferman and Meribeth Cameron
provided music.
