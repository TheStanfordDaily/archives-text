# PACIFIC FLEET SHOULD GIVE CARDINAL KEEN BATTLE
## Picking a Line for Van Gent Will Now Keep Dopesters Busy 
### 
Stanford's grid team got down to
real work today, in preparation for the
hardest non-conference game of the
season 011 the Cardinal field this com
ing Saturday.
Two things came to light over the
past week-end. First, that Gene Van
Gent, Joe Fitzgerald, J. B. Canning,
and "Dink" Templeton have rounded
out a team that must be feared by the
rest of the coast. Second, that the
Pacific Fleet eleven which comes here
Saturday is one that will give the
Cards a run for their money.
California may have been weakened
when they were held at a 21 to 10
score by the fleet aggregation. Wheth
er they were or not, the fact remains

that "Big Bill" Ingram, captain and
fullback of the navy team was able
to boot a field goal in the first quar
ter against the "wonder outfit" and
then run over a touchdown in the final
period of play. Ingram was an All-
American selection when a student at
Annapolis and evidently he hasn't for
gotten much of the game since his col
lege days.
Things have changed in the ranks
of the Cardinal varsity lately.
A couple of weeks ago the Card
mentors were debating as to who they
would be able to put into the game.
Now it looks like a question who will
have to stay off.
After their showing against the
Olympic Club at Ewing Field, Satur
day, it's going to be a hard proposi
tion to keep Faville and Ludeke out
of the line. But Dud DeGroot who
played like a million dollars against
St. Mary's is about ready for the fray
again. And the rest of the varsity
line played perfectly against the "O"
eleven. The life of a head coach is
just one thing after another.
The Card coaches gave the first
string varsity a well deserved lay-off
last night. Van Gent ran the men
through a few signals, gave them a
short talk and then sent them around
the field a couple of times and into
the showers.
During the short signal drill De-
Groot worked out at guard and it
may be that the big fellow is being
groomed to hold down that position.
Ray Doughty, who was injured in the
first few minutes of play, Saturday,
will be in good shape again for the
Pacific Fleet battle. He was out in
suit last night and spent the after
noon jogging around the field about a
dozen times, in order to test out his
battered ankle.
"Shorty" Maitz and Harley Carter
are both limping around but it is ex
pected that they will be ready for
work within a day or two.
