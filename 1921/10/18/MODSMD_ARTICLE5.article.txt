# FRESHMEN WILL MEET SELMA HIGH SCHOOL IN SATURDAY'S GAME
## 
### 
Selma High School will be the next
opponents of the Stanford ,freshmen
eleven, the Sclnia gridiron squad facing
the Babe team next Saturday afternoon
as a preliminary to the Varsity game
with the Pacific Fleet. Last Saturday
the freshmen had little trouble in show
ing up the Stockton High School team
and Coach Seay had a chance to save
his first team by plenty of substitutions.
The Selma squad has a light line but
is reputed to be strong in the overhead
game. The Cardinal Babes have been
weak in this department all season and
the game Saturday will be a test of the
real strength of the freshmen. Coach
Seay and Coach Mularkey have been
drilling the freshmen backs strenuously
in the defense of an aerial attack dur
ing the past two weeks and the game
Saturday should show a decided im
provement in the play of the Babes.
Guy Dennis, the fast little quarter of
the freshmen eleven who was elected
last Friday to lead the Babes this sea
son, has developed into one of the stead
iest players on Coach Mularkey's back
field. With Cuddeback, Gilliland, Wheat,
McCrorie and Howard to. help out in
the backfield the freshmen possess a
good combination of ground gainers.
Wheat has been used at quarter by
Coach Mularkey and will replace Dennis
in case the scrappy little captain is
forced out of the game. McCrorie is
out for the fullback position and is one
of the best open field runners on the
squad.
