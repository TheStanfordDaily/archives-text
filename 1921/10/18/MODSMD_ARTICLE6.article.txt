## 
### 
Rivalry in the singles and doubles
tennis tournaments will wax high, ac
cording to indications from the first day
of play. Every court was taken for the
matches this afternoon, and many were
unable to play. However, from present
plans it is assured that all matches in
the first round will be completed ac
cording to schedule on October 25. Ow
ing to the scarcity of courts it was de
cided that only one set should be played
determine the matches in the singles
tournament, although the regulation
number will be in order in doubles con
tests.
The contenders are requested to get
in touch with their opponents as posted
on the bulletin board as soon as pos
sible in order to finish off the first
round on schedule. In order not to con
flict with the regular classes in tennis,
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturday
mornings are set aside exclusively for
tournament matches. and*such players
will have the right of way on the courts
at these times.
