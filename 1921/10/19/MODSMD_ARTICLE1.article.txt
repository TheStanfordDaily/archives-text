# RISE OF TAILOR WELL DEPICTED IN SMITH PLAY
## Farmer, Greppin Combine to Give Wealth of Design in Elaborateness and Color 
### 
Act two of the "Tailor Made Man"
will have more theatrical features em
bodied in it than any other action on the
Stanford stage has had in a long time.
Ed Farmer, art editor of the 1923 Quad
and designer of last year's junior opera
sets, has created an elaborate and color
ful scene from any home which is worth
a million or so. There will he twenty
eight people on the stage at once. Cos
tumes from Livingston's will carry out
the splendor of the background. Ernest
Greppin has prepared a Hood of effec
tive lights as the finishing touch to what
Coach Davis has called the largest scene
ever attempted on the local stage.
Clyde Coakley, assisted by Sam
Vaughn, is painting the background. A
trio of archs, the smallest of which
curves up to the height of eleven feet,
is backed by a solid stretch of leaded
window through which can be seen the
blue-black night. Rich furniture has been
arranged for to carry out the idea of
the new-rich splurge which the owners
are making but. contrary to tradition,
the splurge will be attractive.
The room is the reception hall of a
new mansion and is filled with guests
attending the ball. The oldest model in
dress clothes allowed is 1922 and then
only with profuse apologies. Livingston
will costume the scene and has promised
the best. With twenty-eight colorful
gowns, liveries and dress suits forming
the picture, it 'appears that it could
scarcely be other than impressive.
Resides being the most brilliant scene,
act two has the most comedy opportunity
of the play. Here the tailor's assistant
breaks into the social ranks in a stolen
dress-suit, captures all the women's
hearts, talks the suit's owner out of two
fifty dollar bills and into an lonian
Yacht Club membership, gets a job and,
in all. rates a million from nothing in
one evening. The maneuvers of the at
tractive grass widow and the passing
about of champagne also feature the
action.
