# CHINA WILL WORK OUT ITS PROBLEMS DIPLOMAT STATES
## Dr. Tenny Discusses Present Situation in Orient in His Lecture in Little Theatre 
### 
"The final constitution and govern
ment of China will probably be formed
along the lines of our own government,"
said Dr. C. 1). Tenny in lecturing on
the "Chinese Republic" last night in the
Little theater. "There will be set dif
ferences between the provincial and cen
tral governments and each will have its
own powers and jurisdictions. If given
time and if the outside powers do not
interfere to keep up the strife in China,
the Chinese requblic will work out its
problems along common sense lines and
will develop into a stable form of gov
ernment."
\\ hen Dr. Tenny first went to China,
thirty-five years ago, the civilization in
China was much the same as it was un
der the Ming dynasty five or six hun
dred years ago. Now it has become
modern in many respects. There are rail
roads in all parts of China. The cities
of the interior have macadam roads.
They are taking up modern methods of
medicine and sanitation. It is a bewilder
ing and sudden change and the Chinese
people are not yet accustomed to it.
"In 1908 the Manchu government at
tempted to modernize the government
and 'did found a constitutional govern
ment which should extend for a period
of nine years, at the end of which time
there should be a parliament represent
ing the people and a cabinet. It was
planned to have a modern constitutional
monarchy and many of the people highly
approved of it. This project, however,
did not satisfy the younger radicals and
in 1910 edict was issued shortening the
length of the constitutional government
by two years. Tliis did not please the
opposing factions and in 1911 the crash
came which brought the end of the mon
archy and the establishment of the re
public."
Dr. Tenny explained the arguments
for and against the idea of a republic
in China as the people saw them at that
time. The Chinese people have always
practiced local self-government in the
provincial localities. There are village
elders who are chosen by popular con
sent. In picking these chiefs, they use
none of the popular electoral methods.
There are also Chinese guilds of the va
rious classes'of working men, the bank
ers' guild being the best organized. In
these election forms an important part.
"If they can manage the local govern
ment and the guilds so creditably, why
cannot they manage their own central
government?"
The Chinese people have never ex
pected or received any help from the
central government. Their only wish
has been that it should leave them alone,
and they have considered taxes as a
solace which they pay to the emperor
for the privilege of not being molested.
"The general sobriety and thoughtful
ness of the people," Dr. Tenny ex
plained," make them able to face new
conditions and to solve the problems
which arise.
"On the other hand, there is a gen
eral illiteracy among the people which
will not be overcome until a phonetic
system for writing in the colloquial and
a literature in theloquial is developed.
The leaders of China are working on
this problem all the time. The attitude
of disinterest in the central government
makes the republic difficult to found."
Dr. Tenny divided the strife and up
risings in China into three periods: the
first, second and third revolutions. He
sketched each of them briefly. The first
was immediately caused by the attempt
of the Manchu government to take over
the railroads, but the underlying cause
was a desire' to get rid of the Manchus.
This was started October 11, 1911, in the
cities of the interior and by January 1,
1912, a president was elected and in
stalled. This president was Dr. Sun
Yat Sen, who immediately adbicated in
favor of Yuan Shih Kai.
As Yuan Shih Kai did not carry out
Dr. Sun's plans, Dr. Sun put himself at
the head of a radical party and caused
an uprising which was quickly put down
and which formed the second revolution.
Later Yuan Shih Kai wanted to be more
than a dictator and to keep the empire
of China for his family. The whole
country rose and effectually quelled
this. Lee Yuan Hung, who had been
the vice-president, became the president
of China. In the summer of 1917, Lee
Hung split with parliament over the
question of declaring war on Germany
and Austria. After seventeen days of
turmoil, the outcome was that Lee Yuan
Hung retired and refused to act as presi
dent.
"Hsu Shih Chang, who is still presi
dent. was elected at that time," said Dr.
Tenny. "He is a scholar and a" con
servative and has a horror of civil war.
Thus far he was resisted all attempts
on the part of the military leaders to
subdue the rebellious factions in the
south. He is peaceful and is developing
a peaceful government, as fas as pos
sible.

"On the other hand, there is a gen
eral illiteracy among the people which
will not be overcome until a phonetic
system for writing in the colloquial and
a literature in theloquial is developed.
The leaders of China are working on
this problem all the time. The attitude
of disinterest in the central government
makes the republic difficult to found."
Dr. Tenny divided the strife and up
risings in China into three periods: the
first, second and third revolutions. He
sketched each of them briefly. The first
was immediately caused by the attempt
of the Manchu government to take over
the railroads, but the underlying cause
was a desire' to get rid of the Manchus.
This was started October 11, 1911, in the
cities of the interior and by January 1,
1912, a president was elected and in
stalled. This president was Dr. Sun
Yat Sen, who immediately adbicated in
favor of Yuan Shih Kai.
As Yuan Shih Kai did not carry out
Dr. Sun's plans, Dr. Sun put himself at
the head of a radical party and caused
an uprising which was quickly put down
and which formed the second revolution.
Later Yuan Shih Kai wanted to be more
than a dictator and to keep the empire
of China for his family. The whole
country rose and effectually quelled
this. Lee Yuan Hung, who had been
the vice-president, became the president
of China. In the summer of 1917, Lee
Hung split with parliament over the
question of declaring war on Germany
and Austria. After seventeen days of
turmoil, the outcome was that Lee Yuan
Hung retired and refused to act as presi
dent.
"Hsu Shih Chang, who is still presi
dent. was elected at that time," said Dr.
Tenny. "He is a scholar and a" con
servative and has a horror of civil war.
Thus far he was resisted all attempts
on the part of the military leaders to
subdue the rebellious factions in the
south. He is peaceful and is developing
a peaceful government, as fas as pos
sible.
"The final constitution and govern
ment of China will probably be formed
along the lines of our own government,"
said Dr. C. 1). Tenny in lecturing on
the "Chinese Republic" last night in the
Little theater. "There will be set dif
ferences between the provincial and cen
tral governments and each will have its
own powers and jurisdictions. If given
time and if the outside powers do not
interfere to keep up the strife in China,
the Chinese requblic will work out its
problems along common sense lines and
will develop into a stable form of gov
ernment."
\\ hen Dr. Tenny first went to China,
thirty-five years ago, the civilization in
China was much the same as it was un
der the Ming dynasty five or six hun
dred years ago. Now it has become
modern in many respects. There are rail
roads in all parts of China. The cities
of the interior have macadam roads.
They are taking up modern methods of
medicine and sanitation. It is a bewilder
ing and sudden change and the Chinese
people are not yet accustomed to it.
"In 1908 the Manchu government at
tempted to modernize the government
and 'did found a constitutional govern
ment which should extend for a period
of nine years, at the end of which time
there should be a parliament represent
ing the people and a cabinet. It was
planned to have a modern constitutional
monarchy and many of the people highly
approved of it. This project, however,
did not satisfy the younger radicals and
in 1910 edict was issued shortening the
length of the constitutional government
by two years. Tliis did not please the
opposing factions and in 1911 the crash
came which brought the end of the mon
archy and the establishment of the re
public."
Dr. Tenny explained the arguments
for and against the idea of a republic
in China as the people saw them at that
time. The Chinese people have always
practiced local self-government in the
provincial localities. There are village
elders who are chosen by popular con
sent. In picking these chiefs, they use
none of the popular electoral methods.
There are also Chinese guilds of the va
rious classes'of working men, the bank
ers' guild being the best organized. In
these election forms an important part.
"If they can manage the local govern
ment and the guilds so creditably, why
cannot they manage their own central
government?"
The Chinese people have never ex
pected or received any help from the
central government. Their only wish
has been that it should leave them alone,
and they have considered taxes as a
solace which they pay to the emperor
for the privilege of not being molested.
"The general sobriety and thoughtful
ness of the people," Dr. Tenny ex
plained," make them able to face new
conditions and to solve the problems
which arise.
