# CHESTER ROWELL TO LECTURE ON JAPAN'S ARMAMENT ATTITUDE
## 
### 
Chester Rowell, former editor of the
Fresno Republican, anil now a member
of the California State Railroad Com
mission, will give a lecture on Wednes
day, October 26, under the auspices of
the World Problems Forum of the local
Y. M. C. A.
Our relations with Japan, with espe
cial reference to the coming disarma
ment conference, will be the topic of
Mr. Rowell's talk. He has spent the
summer in Japan and has been able to
get first-hand information that is up-to
date.
The problem of how the Nipponese
empire will act toward the question of
junking the weapons of war when the
question conies down to a practical issue
is one which is puzzling wiseacres all
over the country. Our relations with
Japan are undoubtedly especially import
ant in regard to this point, and Rowell
will clear tip some of the vague discus
sions that have been going on over this
question. Tie spoke last year before a
campus audience which patronized his
talk with a large crowd.
