# Queeners Asked to Suspend Operations During Big Game

"Stanford rooters will be called upon
to stage a spectacle in the biggest sec
tion they have ever been called upon to
fill when the new stadium is opened to
its first Big Game crowd, November
19th," Homer Mitchell, chairman of the
stunt committee, today said, "so it is
imperative that every man be in the
rooting section. Queeners are asked to
keep the date open.
"With the opening of the biggest sta
dium the Cardinal rooters are expected
to put over a stunt larger than ever be
fore attempted. The smallest section
available is about three times the size of
the ordinary bleacher division. Need
less to say a good stunt will have to
cover the entire area and to do this
every man will be needed. When buying
tickets next Tuesday these facts should
be kept in mind."
The stunt committee has planned the
most elaborate challenge in history. New
hats will probably lie introduced which
will be built in solid reversible colors.
More concerning the stunt will be an
nounced later.
