# BABE SOCCERITES TO OPEN SEASON
## 
### 
Next Saturday morning the freshmen
soccer squad, which has taken the place
of the Young Men's Hebrew Association
in the soccer schedule, will sojourn to
the Berkeley campus where they will
take on the Golden Bear's soccer var
sity in the second of their scheduled
games. As the Babes held the Stanford
varsity to a 2-1 victory in their game of
last Friday, the coming game will be 110
walkaway for the California eleven. The
1925 aggregation is out to do its best,
and constant scrimmage with the var
sity has done much for the freshmen in
the past week.
From the standpoint of the fan, the
game will be important in that it will
give the iirst accurate dope as to the
standing of the California and Stanford
varsities. These two teams, ever oppos
ing one another, have, as last year,
taken the lead in the schedule and are
anxiously awaiting their meeting on No
vember 19.
Last night the freshmen got together
and elected a captain for the coming
season. Ray Baugh was unanimously
elected to fill the place of skipper. He
plays center half and is one of the ablest
of the freshmen players. His constant
rushing of the ball and his long and
accurate boot make him a man to be
feared by any opposing team. Hall and
Off are others of the freshmen who have
been showing a high class of work in
the scrimmages. Both are fast, and they
have the rare combination of foot and
head work. Undoubtedly they will get
a chance at the Bears Saturday.
The probable freshmen lineup will be:
Carey, 01, Cardoza or Hall, il, Roduquex
cf, Quigley ir, Hoover or, Off lb, Capt.
Baugh ch, Cannon rh, Turquand If, Meza
rf, and W. Hays lg.
