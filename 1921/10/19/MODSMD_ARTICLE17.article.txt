# HARD BATTLE DUE WITH NAVY TEAM, IS LOCAL OPINION
## Card Wreckers Have Chance To Run Bill Ingram's Crew on the Rocks, Says Dope 
### 
Football followers on the campus who
saw the Stanford Varsity trim the
Olympics at Ewing Field Saturday were
today busily engaged prognosticating the
result of the coming battle with the
Pacific Fleet crew.
The general consensus of opinion
seemed to be that if the Cards play as
well here Saturday against "Big Bill"
Ingram's hand-picked set as they did
against the club men, Van Gent will he
able to put another feather in his cap
after the game.
At any rate it's bound to be -a torrid
melee and the odds seem to be about
fifty-fifty.
A city sporting writer described the
fieet eleven as the best team that Cali
fornia would meet this season. That may
or may not he true but it at least goes to
prove that the men from the big war
ships must have a wicked aggregation.
Practically every man on their roster
has had an abundance of experience on
the gridiron. Several, including Captain
Ingram, who does the kicking, passing
and in between times most of the plung
ing for the team, are former selections
on Walter Camp's All-American teams.
All of the men have to do is play foot
ball. They are in the best of shape and
should give Stanford its hardest fight
so far this season.
It is too early to try to dope out even
a tentative Card lineup for Saturday.
The backfield is fairly certain to be
Shlaudcman, Wilcox, Doughty and Pat
rick with Woodward ready to go in at
any time.
It is the line that gives the wise ones
the real job, and unless Van Gent gives
out some pretty definite dope before the
game it is a toss-up as to who will start.
At present there are about twelve line
men who can't he left out, figuring it on
paper, and yet the rules say that a team
may have only seven men in the line.
The Varsity underwent a hard drill
last night and that sort of thing seems
to he on the menu all the rest of the
week. There is still plenty of room for
improvement in the work even if the
Olympic Club affair showed the Cardi
nals to be 50 per cent better than most
everyone had given them credit for
being.
