# OUTLOOK GOOD FOR LIGHTWEIGHT ELEVEN
## 
### 
Fifty-five men appeared on the polo
field last night for the first practice
workout of the prospective 135-pound
team. Richard Blood, '21, was in chargc
of the candidates, and formed two squads
which were directed by former mem
bers of the second varsity squad who
are trying out for the lightweight team.
Some very good prospects from the
varsity and freshman football squads and
transfers from soccer have entered the
competition. A few have been training
under the varsity and freshman coaches
since September 15. If enough interest
is shown in this branch of athletics Di
rector Powell has promised an excellent
coach.
Suits are yreatly needed, and men hav
ing outfits they are not using are asked
to turn them in at once. Last night only
eleven of the fifty-five enthusiasts were
garbed according to Spaulding. Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one
of these. Every kind of outfit except
polo and golf suits seemed to be present.
However, the fighting spirit was also
there, and the bunch is out to learn the
game with the hope that the executive
council will grant letter rewards to those
who play against the California weight
men. Two hours a night and five days
in the week is the program of training
and instruction.
On account of the absence of proper
football suits no scrimmage will prob
ably be given until late next week. 'I lie
men practiced throwing and catching
passes, cutting in for forward passes,
starting, and other elementary drills. It
is not too late to try out for positions.
Linesmen, especially, arc wanted. Expe
rience in any position is at a premium,
since the quantity of raw material is
considerable.
