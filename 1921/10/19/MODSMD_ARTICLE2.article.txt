# WRESTLING PROSPECTS LOOK GOOD THIS YEAR
## 
### 
Unusual interest is being displayed
in wrestling this year, as is evidenced
by the large turnout of both varsity
ant Coach Vaughn Hosepian, 135-
ent Grecian sport. Walter Powell, who
has succeeded Harry Maloney in this
branch of sports, is out every day
whipping the men into line early, for
the match with the Bruins. Assist
ant Coach Vaughn Hosepian, 'Im
pounder, who was the only man to win
his match last year against California,
is Powell's right-hand man.
In the varsity 125-pound class is
Bob Fleming, who put up such a stiff
fight against K. Chang, the Chinese
wonder from U. C. Chang received
the decision, Fleming has im
proved so much that Mr. Chang is apt
to lose his cue when they meet this
year. Vaughn Hosepian is practically
the only man available at present for
the 135-pound class. Hosepian is a
past master at the wrestling game, and
it is doubtful that any man the Bears
put up will be able to stop him. An
other gent who is showing up well is
Burt Proctor, a big wiry fellow who
represents the 145-pounders. Proctor
was on last year's squad, but did not
have the opportunity of an outside
match. Bill Fawcett, who was one of
the star wrestlers of the 1919 fresh
man class, is back again, and is pre
pared to battle the Bears in the 158-
pound class. Of the 158-pound men,
however, Andy Mercer, the grappler
who tussled 9 minutes with the much
touted K. Newby of California, is Stan
ford's best bet. in this class. Newby
finally won the decision, but it is not
likely that this will be repeated, for
Mercer is displaying better form this
season. In the 165-pound class, Dick
Johnson, another veteran, is on hand
to tackle the Bruin's best man. John
son was the man who made a power
ful showing against the California
whrilwind, Golden, last year.
Tentative plans have been made for
schedules with several other wrestling
teams of the Pacific Coast. It is
Coach Powell's plan to give wrestling
a prestige among the minor sports at
Stanford by turning out a strong team
this year. Any man who has had ex
perience or is interested in this branch
of athletics is urged to come out and
try for the team. Such men should
report to either Coach Powell or Hose
pian.

Tentative plans have been made for
schedules with several other wrestling
teams of the Pacific Coast. It is
Coach Powell's plan to give wrestling
a prestige among the minor sports at
Stanford by turning out a strong team
this year. Any man who has had ex
perience or is interested in this branch
of athletics is urged to come out and
try for the team. Such men should
report to either Coach Powell or Hose
