# CHOOSING YOUR FRATERNITY
## 
### 
Evidently the question of fraternities which all
new students face at Stanford is practically the same
as that encountered by entering students in other
institutions throughout the country. The following
is clipped from the editorial columns of the Minne
sota Daily and reprinted because the situation there
is identical in many respects with the situation here.
While this editorial refers only to the men, it is
equally applicable to the problem faced by the enter
ing women of Stanford.
PLEDGE NIGHT
Tonight nearly 200 men will decide "which fraternity."
While affecting only a ocmparatively small number of uni
versity freshmen, pledge night is important in that the
college lives of these 200, as well as those who decide to
pledge to no fraternity at all, will be determined to no small
degree by the choices made today.
To the freshman away from home for the first time, the
host of attentions and the mass of contradictory informa
tion and advice attendant upon the rushing season is indeed
confusing.
In the absence of any previous discussion of the subject,
and in the hope that the good advice contained therein may
help first-year men to make the right decision tonight, the
Daily reprints the following on fraternities from the 1919
Minnesota handbook. The advice therein was never more
timely than today.
"To the man who comes to Minnesota for the first time,
the fraternity question may seem of momentous importance.
A fraternity in its best sense, means a brotherhood of those
who have common interests for the purpose of mutual ad
vantage. To some people the advantages of a fraternity
have been so exaggerated that they assume distorted pro
portions; to others a fraternity seems to stand for all that
is bad in college life. It is hard to tell which of these two
view-points is the worse; both are to be avoided.
"If you are asked to join a fraternity, consider it care
fully. Look up its t.standing, locally and nationally, before
you give any fraternity an answer to its invitation to join.
Put such questions up to yourself as, 'Are these the sort
of men with whom I want to live; would I be willing and
glad to introduce them to my people at home as my best
friends; are their interests and mine so linked that their
association with me will be of help to me; and will mine
— ) )e 0 f benefit to the fraternity?' Furthermore,
uld be considered. Can you afford the additional
"Uo siow in joining a fraternity; the best fraternities are
willing to wait for the best men. You owe that much to
yourself, to the people who are sending you to school, to
the men—though they may try to persuade you otherwise—
who have done you the honor to ask you to join their fra
ternity. The one who takes time to consider the matter
and then makes his decision, rarely makes a mistake in this*
matter.
"There are men and women here, some of them among
our best students, who have not joined a fraternity, and the
joining or not joining of such an organization is in no sense
any criterion of a man's or girl's success at Minnesota. If
you are not asked to join a fraternity, that is no sign that
you are any less desirable than those who are asked, and it
is no index of your success here. Is one of the faults in
the fraternity system that many of the best men in every
university are not given the privilege of becoming fra
ternity men.
"The best fraternity man considers his fraternity to be
but an opportunity for service to the university. A man is
given a home, close friendships with those who have a com
mon ideal, and under these conditions he can work better
for the institution, which makes fraternities possible. The
man who thinks his fraternity more important than his
college is an honor neither to his fraternity nor to the college.
Fraternities are coming more and more to realize that only
as they work for the institutions of which they are a part
arc they fulfilling their purpose as college organizations.
"Frequently it is said that the fraetrnity man 'looks down'
on the man inside. We believe that such an attitude is not
prevalent at Minnesota. If it were generally true, fraterni
ties would have no justification for existence. The fraternity
man who docs this is soon put by his fellow students in the
class to which he belongs much the same as is the man out
side who viciously attacks fraternities simply because they
arc fraternities. The fraternity snob and the non-fraternity
knocker are in much the same class. Fortunately there are
few of either here. We believe that we have at Minnesota
a relation between fraternity men and non-fraternity men
that is exceedingly good and whether or not you join a
fraternity, remember that the fostering of such a rclataion
is the sort of thing that we as Minnesota men must work
for."

PLEDGE NIGHT
Tonight nearly 200 men will decide "which fraternity."
While affecting only a ocmparatively small number of uni
versity freshmen, pledge night is important in that the
college lives of these 200, as well as those who decide to
pledge to no fraternity at all, will be determined to no small
degree by the choices made today.
To the freshman away from home for the first time, the
host of attentions and the mass of contradictory informa
tion and advice attendant upon the rushing season is indeed
confusing.
In the absence of any previous discussion of the subject,
and in the hope that the good advice contained therein may
help first-year men to make the right decision tonight, the
Daily reprints the following on fraternities from the 1919
Minnesota handbook. The advice therein was never more
timely than today.
"To the man who comes to Minnesota for the first time,
the fraternity question may seem of momentous importance.
A fraternity in its best sense, means a brotherhood of those
who have common interests for the purpose of mutual ad
vantage. To some people the advantages of a fraternity
have been so exaggerated that they assume distorted pro
portions; to others a fraternity seems to stand for all that
is bad in college life. It is hard to tell which of these two
view-points is the worse; both are to be avoided.
"If you are asked to join a fraternity, consider it care
fully. Look up its t.standing, locally and nationally, before
you give any fraternity an answer to its invitation to join.
Put such questions up to yourself as, 'Are these the sort
of men with whom I want to live; would I be willing and
glad to introduce them to my people at home as my best
friends; are their interests and mine so linked that their
association with me will be of help to me; and will mine
— ) )e 0 f benefit to the fraternity?' Furthermore,
uld be considered. Can you afford the additional
"Uo siow in joining a fraternity; the best fraternities are
willing to wait for the best men. You owe that much to
yourself, to the people who are sending you to school, to
the men—though they may try to persuade you otherwise—
who have done you the honor to ask you to join their fra
ternity. The one who takes time to consider the matter
and then makes his decision, rarely makes a mistake in this*
matter.
"There are men and women here, some of them among
our best students, who have not joined a fraternity, and the
joining or not joining of such an organization is in no sense
any criterion of a man's or girl's success at Minnesota. If
you are not asked to join a fraternity, that is no sign that
you are any less desirable than those who are asked, and it
is no index of your success here. Is one of the faults in
the fraternity system that many of the best men in every
university are not given the privilege of becoming fra
ternity men.
"The best fraternity man considers his fraternity to be
but an opportunity for service to the university. A man is
given a home, close friendships with those who have a com
mon ideal, and under these conditions he can work better
for the institution, which makes fraternities possible. The
man who thinks his fraternity more important than his
college is an honor neither to his fraternity nor to the college.
Fraternities are coming more and more to realize that only
as they work for the institutions of which they are a part
arc they fulfilling their purpose as college organizations.
"Frequently it is said that the fraetrnity man 'looks down'
on the man inside. We believe that such an attitude is not
prevalent at Minnesota. If it were generally true, fraterni
ties would have no justification for existence. The fraternity
man who docs this is soon put by his fellow students in the
class to which he belongs much the same as is the man out
side who viciously attacks fraternities simply because they
arc fraternities. The fraternity snob and the non-fraternity
knocker are in much the same class. Fortunately there are
few of either here. We believe that we have at Minnesota
a relation between fraternity men and non-fraternity men
that is exceedingly good and whether or not you join a
fraternity, remember that the fostering of such a rclataion
is the sort of thing that we as Minnesota men must work
for."
Evidently the question of fraternities which all
new students face at Stanford is practically the same
as that encountered by entering students in other
institutions throughout the country. The following
is clipped from the editorial columns of the Minne
sota Daily and reprinted because the situation there
is identical in many respects with the situation here.
