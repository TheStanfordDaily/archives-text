Just how much do you know of the finer points of
American football? If you were to peer into a copy
of the 1921 rule book you doubtless would be sur
prised at the numl>er of strange terms that would
meet your eyes. What is the rule governing the
position of a backfield man on the line of scrim
mage? Do you know what a touchback is? A
safety? These are a few of the principles of foot
hall established and interpreted by the National
Rules Committee and published yearly in book form.
Hut they are written in technical form so that a per
son who does not play the game finds it difficult to

understand thetn.
A thorough understanding of the fundamentals
of the game is necessary to well-timed expression
from the bleachers. Every follower of the Cardi
nal team should know when a penalty is inflicted in
the game just what it is for and whether it is justi
fied. When a brilliant play is executed the rooting
section should he ready to applaud. This is possible
only if the fundamentals of the game are understood.
A series of lectures on the principles of American
football and the technique of the game have been
arranged. Every studeiU who is interested can learn
first hand from men who have played the game and
are now coaching teams. Football is an all-absorb
ing topic during this time of the year throughout
the United States. Especially in the universities is
this interest at its height. An intelligent understand
ing by university students will do more than any
other thing to increase the public knowledge and
popularity of the game.
