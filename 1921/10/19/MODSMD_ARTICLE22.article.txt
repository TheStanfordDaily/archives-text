Tragedy in scenes by
S. N. Ache.
First sight. (Moonlight, wine-jug (not very empty), a
couple of thous, (piering in the dark.)
.Akbar —One more look like that and I shall plunge
myself into the briny salt-water.
Anna —Yes. It was pretty dirty.
Akbar —I am no green pea, Anna.
Anna—No, Akbar, you know the Orpheum joke about
where Sandy Claws went after he handed out the toys.
It's too bad you're a '23, Akbar.
Akbar —Ah, Ah, and why?
Anna —That puts you in my class.
What was second seen (Moonlight—this time with
green light for special lighting arrangements great cre
dit being due electrician—Jug (empty and rest).
Anna —You are cold. You cough. What shall I do.
(Pathos) You should take something for that cough?
Akbar —(brightening—earnest electrician lights moon
scarlet) —What? Where? (Blah.)
Anna —Any drug store. Arsenic.
(Chorus women seen in offing).
(Enter red-headed stranger. Looks like dope writer).
St:Hi, coarse, (aside) They seem to be shaping up
well. I don't like the looks of the ends though.
Too bad their names aren't Muller. Miss Conduct, I
have seen you before.
Anna —Akbar.
Ak:—Yes.
Anna —This man beats you by one lap.
Ak: —No, no, you mustn't say it.
Anna —Lap of blue mud.
(Mourning et so forth) Her last act—(Same as be
fore. Older).
Ak: —I'd like to kiss you the worst way.
Anna —Come here and I'll show you the best way.
(Stage business.)

Even the comps need to take Walter
Powell's course, starting tonight. Yes
terday, friend D. D. put for "Do you
know exactly what is a touchback?"
touchdown.

(Personal —Don't publish.)
Dear Editor:' —I have been told that public opinion is
*a very flexible person. He can see the same thing from
several sides at once. On the other hand, he is some
times stubborn or blind. Can you tell me whether these
traits are caused by heredity or by environment.
Your humble servant,
I. M. USUAL.

Holy Smoke! We were supposed to omit that. Oh
well, now that it's done, we might as well go further
into the matter. We don't know whether to be insulted
for a bawling-out or flattered for being covertly re
ferred to as Public Opinion. Evidently, some bird has
had his plumage ruffled the wrong way. In answer to
the question, we guess "environment." This is the
first generation of Cabbages, so we conclude that Here
dity is out of the question.

As to the name of the author and the nature of the
communication, we'll say it's anything but "Usual."
Why not "Awful"?

You tellem, salad, you know the combination.

Each one who went to see Pierrot's heart throb re
member the aptness of the song "I am Like a Ship's
White Sail." It took lots of wind to make that bellow
ing.

Mimi —Say, what's this strange coat of arms on this
dish mean.
Dodo—Community Plate, y'know.

Last night
A guy came
In, and said:
"Say,
What's that you're writing?"
I
Told him that
It was the column I had to write
Because
The regular author was too busy
Snaking.
Said he:
"Why
Don't you write some
Of this
Free and easy verse?
You know.
The kind that only has one
Word
To a line,
And each' line rhymes with
Itself."
So I did.

OFFICER, DUST OFF THE ELECTRIC CHAIR!
