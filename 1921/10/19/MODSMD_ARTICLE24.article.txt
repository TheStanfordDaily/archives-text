# COLLEGE STUDENT OWNS AND OPERATES PLANE ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
"Verily, times have changed!" Who.
a few years ago, would have prophesied
that college students would come to use
the aeroplane as a means of travel to
and from the campus?
The campus is familiar now with the
droning hum of a plane overhead. The
machine is owned and piloted by Ber
nard J. Birnie, '25, who entered Stan
ford in the summer quarter. Birnie
has been in the Hying game since 1909,
and has known men intimately whose
names are immemorable in the history
of aviation; Hoxey, Beacliy, Johnson,
Martin, Curtiss and others. When asked
why he was still alive his reply was
short but full of a world of history: "I
never did stunt flying in the old-style
ships." Birnie is using a plane of the
Curtiss army training type, JN 4.
While traveling in Europe before
aviatio nbecame a success Birnie was
interested in the fore-runner of the mod
ern aeroplane, the glider. After this
type of machine was equipped with en
gines he learned to fly and before the
war was a pioneer pilot on the West
coast, carrying passengers and entering
in exhibition meets. During the war,
Birnie was one of the famous dollar-a
year men, and was instructor at the
main training center in France. Al
though never badly hurt in a plane be
had the ill luck to be thrown from the
top of a hangar in France and seriously
injured. His recovery has been slow
but he is once more in the game.
Birnie is maporing here in mechanical
engineering preparatory to taking up
aeronautical engineering at Boston
Tech.
