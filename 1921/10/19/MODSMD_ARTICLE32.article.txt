## 
### 
Dr. Jordan has recently received a
large amount of material from Tor
rance, Los Angeles. Two hills of or
ganic material have been discovered at
tliis point and are being ground up for
fertilizer for which purpose they are
extremely valuable. There are fossil
shells, clams, abolones, snails, scollops,
etc. Some are from the deep sea while
others are from shallow water. Among
the more interesting of the remains sent
here are the teeth of a new shark which,
100 feet long; the bones of saber-toothed
100 feet long; the bones of saber-toother
tigers, of extinct horses, of whales and
of many other forms of marine life. Dr.
Jordan says: "This is the most incon
gruous mass vvliich lias ever been un
covered. It is not yet explained. It be
longs to the early Pleistocene period,
perhaps 150,000 years ago, or as far back
as the origin of man. They claim that
there are human relics in the mass, but
none were sent here. Students who wish
to examine these materials, and also the
collection of fishes which Dr. Jordan
collected while in Hawaii this summer,
will find them in the laboratory just op
posite Dr. Jordan's office in the Zoology
building.
