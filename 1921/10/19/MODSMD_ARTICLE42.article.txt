# Iota Sigma Pi Hears Report of Convention
## 
### 
A report of the national conference
of lota Sigma Pi, Women's Chemistry
Society, was the main business of the
meeting of the local chapter, held last
night in the Women's Clubhouse. The
report was read by Ruth Lee, '22, who
attended the convention in Berkeley this
summer as the representative of Stan
ford University.
Among the various changes effected
during the gathering were several in the
national constitution, raising the scholar
ship requirements, and the choice of a
simple key as the sorority pin, in place
of the hexagonal shape heretofore used.
It was also reported that Madam Curie
has been made an honorary member of
lota Sigma Pi.
