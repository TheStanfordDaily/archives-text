# CLASS SWIMMING MEET TOMORROW
## Swimmers of Four Classes to Compete at "Gym" Pool; Exhibitions are Scheduled 
### 
Excitement in large quantities will
hold sway at the Encina pool tomor
row afternoon, at 4:30, when repre
sentatives from the four classes will
tangle in the year's first inter-class
rivalry.
Every event will be close, thinks
Ernie Brandsten, swimming coach, and
it is impossible to predict which class
will be the winner. The sophomores
seem to have the edge, although the
seniors have many fast men entered.
The 220 should be one of the fea
ture races of the afternoon. A. Austin,
'23. has entered this event in place of
the 50, and he and Greppin, '24, will
fight it out for first honors. The 50
will be close between H. Austin, '22,
Drake, '22, and Klebahn, a freshman
from Honolulu. Another event that
will be pretty to watch is the diving,
with Pinkston, '23, world's champion,
providing most of the thrills. Sned
don, '23, and White, '24, are also high
class divers.
The swimming season will be in full
swing by the next week. On October
29, the freshman team will meet Lo
well High School in the local pool.
Lowell always has a good aggregation
of mermen, and this year they are no
exception. It will give Brandsten an
opportunity of seeing how his first
year prospects shape up.
The first varsity meet, that with the
strong Olympic Club, which was ori
ginally scheduled for here on Novem
ber 5, will be held instead at the
Olympic pool in the city, on Friday
evening. The clubmen have some of
the best swimmers on the coast
wearing the winged "O" and the var
sity will have to upset the 'dope' con
siderably to win.
Stanford may be the scene of the
National Springboard Diving Champi
onships if the negotiations now being
carried on with the A. A. U. are suc
cessful. There is quite a good chance
to land the meet with Pinkston, holder
of four national diving championships
and one world's championship, a stu
dent here. The title meet is to be
held sometime in March, 1922.
