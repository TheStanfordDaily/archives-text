# TRYOUTS FOR DEBATE WITH CALIFORNIA TO BE HELD OCTOBER 26
## 
### 
Professor Emerson, debating coach,
I has submitted the question to the
j University of California for the an-
I nual Stanford-California debate, and
! lias set the date for the tryouts for
j Wednesday, October 26, from 2 to 5
I o'clock, in the Little Theatre. The
question submitted is, "Resolved,
That Congress Should Enact a Law
Exempting the United States Coast
wise Shipping from the Paylment of
Panama Canal Tolls." Tryoutees are
to choose either side of the question
or any phase of it. Tryout speeches
will be five minutes in length with
a rebuttal of three minutes.
The debate will not be held on the
evening preceding the Big Game as
was previously announced, but has
: been postponed until the week after
Thanksgiving. California debaters
I will choose the side th.it they will
i defend, and Stanford must represent
i the other side of the question.
Professor Emerson is very opti
mistic about the material that has
already turned out, and predicts a
good year for the debaters.
