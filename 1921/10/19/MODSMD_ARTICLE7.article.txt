# EXECUTIVE BODY PASSES PLAN FOR ROOTING SECTION
## Seats Are to Be Assigned to Big Game Rooters; Dance Will Follow Football Show 
### 
A seating plan for the rooting section
for the Big Game, requiring students
to take their assigned seats, as proposed
by Graduate Manager William Fletcher,
was endorsed by the executive commit
tee at its regular meeting last night. Ac
cording to the plan, every student hold
ing a seat in the rooting section must
be in his seat by a set time or forfeit
the seat. This'plan will aid the yell
leader in organizing the rooting section
more readily, and will also aid those in
charge in handling the enormous crowd
which is expected.
The possibility of changing the scene
of the football rally from the Assembly
1 lall to the stadium was left to the dis
cretion of the rally committee. Bob
Connolly, yell leader, his assistants and
the stunt committee will decide as to
whether the ancient custom will be de
parted from.
Fred Ludeke was appointed a com
mittee of one to investigate the cost of
a granite block to be used as a corner
stone for the stadium, and to determine
the best location of the block.
A committee consisting of Russ Se
wall, Dick Taylor and Ambrose Whit
iner was appointed to arrange for a
student body dance after the football
show.
Six members of the class of '24 were
awarded the privilege of wearing second
class numerals for swimming.
Several applications for dates were
approved.
