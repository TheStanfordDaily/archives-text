# CROSS-COUNTRY RUN TO BE OCTOBER 22
## 
### 
October 22 has been set as the day
on which the intramural cross-country
run wil be held. The race is open to
all comers and already a number of
campus living and eating clubs have en
tered contestants. Judging .from the
popularity of this race last year, a large
number of men will be on the mark
when the starter's gun barks its signal
at 10 a. m.
Training should have begun several
weeks ago since the cross-country run
is one of the hardest of the year's in
tramural track contests. It is probable
that the course used next week will
follow the substantially varsity training
cousre of last spring which started
from the polo field and continued
through Frenchman's cut, around the
foothills, across the bed of the Laguni
ta, past the chemistry building and fin
ished at Encina gymnasium.
A number of eating clubs and living
groups have entered men in the con
test and many more are expected to
sign tip by tomorrow night. Coaches
Maloncy and Botsford will take charge
of the race and will aid in training en
trants. All those wishing to enter are
urged to report at once to either of
these coaches and receive instructions
for training. A plaque wil be awarded
the winner of the contest.
