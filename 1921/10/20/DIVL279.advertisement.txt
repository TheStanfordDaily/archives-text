EXTRACT from S. F. EXAMINER
Photography is the passion of Mr. Davey's
life and into it he has put all his marvelous
energy and enthusiasm. Constant experiment
and improvement in his work have marked his
professional career.
Undoubtedly, no other one photographer in
the world has taken such a wide variety of
scenic views, or of people. All parts of the
world have yielded their attractions to his
camera, and almost all the famous men and
women of the times have sat for him.
He has autographic photographs of great men
and women from all parts of the world and in
every profession and walk of life.
There is not a better equipped gallery
in the state.
