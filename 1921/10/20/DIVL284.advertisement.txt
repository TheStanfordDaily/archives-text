@ 1 You know what you've
, always wanted a cigarette to do.
Chesterfields do it.
They not only please your
taste but they do another thing—
They satisfy.
They give to your smoking a
"completeness" that is altogether
new and different.
Those fine tobaccos —Turkish,
Burley and other choice Domestic
varieties —are blended right.

"satisfy" anywhere else.
Don't try it —try Chesterfields.
