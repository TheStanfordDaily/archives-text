# DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED IN CAST FOR PLAY ROLES
## Coach Davis Believes Success of "Tailor-Made Man" to Depend on Interpretations 
### 
"More depends upon the successful
interpretation of the character parts in
'The Tailor Made Man' than upon al
most any other one feature," Coach
Davis said today. "There is hardly a
prominent role which has not some in
dividual slant which distinguishes and
makes it difficult."
Five foreign accents have to be de
veloped for the evening of the 28th and
about twice as many national jargons
perfected before the play could be
called a knockout. There are but three
essential persons in the action who have
straight lines and this fact, although it
will put the Sword and Sandals produc
tion among the historical hits, creates
a formidable obstacle which is being
slowly overcome.
The only reputed character actor in
an important role is Paul Claflin. The
merry Englishman of Bubbling Bohe
mia and the mischief massaging mule
manager, Clarence, have been scored to
his credit already. In this comedy, Jel
licot, the affable, affected Anglo-Ameri
can, will serve as the vehicle for Claflin's
humor. The last word in distress to
Jcllicot is the feeling attendant upon
appearing at a party in an antedated
dress suit and the height of his ambi
tion is the lonian Yacht Club, both of
which he attains in the most farcical
manner.
Tailor Huber and Dr. Sonntag, played
by Cecil Morris and Tom Kennedy, re
spectively, express themselves after the
manner of the Vaterland. Morris has
the most radical accent of the two which
be continually uses to great advantage
in classifying his lazy assistants. Ken
nedy, playing the villain's part who has
a doctor's education and therefore a
more democratic speech along with his
black heart, relies less on his inflection
and more on his storming in action.
A. D. Cohan is a Scotchman. Besides
knowing l]is duty lie realizes the pur
chasing power of the long green after
the traditional highland style and can
be relied upon to thrash out all con
ilicts between the two ideas in an almost
perfect black and white dialect which
gets funnier as it improves day by day.
The last of the distinctly foreign is
Pomeroy, the English valet, played by
Fred Hughes. He took the part of Tipu,
the sovereign sultan in "Maid to Order"
last year, and was very successful as the
dignified purely-spoken regent. A Cock
ney speech is the sine qua non of this
role, which he is learning fast enough
to be worth looking forward to.
Other characters are obsessed with
the patois of the socially climbing. Al
most everybody in a prominent role is
slated for a certain degree of much de
livery. The brow attitude is almost uni
versal and is responsible for much of
the best comedy.

dignified purely-spoken regent. A Cock
ney speech is the sine qua non of this
role, which he is learning fast enough
to be worth looking forward to.
Other characters are obsessed with
the patois of the socially climbing. Al
most everybody in a prominent role is
slated for a certain degree of much de
livery. The brow attitude is almost uni
versal and is responsible for much of
the best comedy.
"More depends upon the successful
interpretation of the character parts in
'The Tailor Made Man' than upon al
most any other one feature," Coach
Davis said today. "There is hardly a
prominent role which has not some in
dividual slant which distinguishes and
makes it difficult."
Five foreign accents have to be de
veloped for the evening of the 28th and
about twice as many national jargons
perfected before the play could be
called a knockout. There are but three
essential persons in the action who have
straight lines and this fact, although it
will put the Sword and Sandals produc
tion among the historical hits, creates
a formidable obstacle which is being
slowly overcome.
The only reputed character actor in
an important role is Paul Claflin. The
merry Englishman of Bubbling Bohe
mia and the mischief massaging mule
manager, Clarence, have been scored to
his credit already. In this comedy, Jel
licot, the affable, affected Anglo-Ameri
can, will serve as the vehicle for Claflin's
humor. The last word in distress to
Jcllicot is the feeling attendant upon
appearing at a party in an antedated
dress suit and the height of his ambi
tion is the lonian Yacht Club, both of
which he attains in the most farcical
manner.
Tailor Huber and Dr. Sonntag, played
by Cecil Morris and Tom Kennedy, re
spectively, express themselves after the
manner of the Vaterland. Morris has
the most radical accent of the two which
be continually uses to great advantage
in classifying his lazy assistants. Ken
nedy, playing the villain's part who has
a doctor's education and therefore a
more democratic speech along with his
black heart, relies less on his inflection
and more on his storming in action.
A. D. Cohan is a Scotchman. Besides
knowing l]is duty lie realizes the pur
chasing power of the long green after
the traditional highland style and can
be relied upon to thrash out all con
ilicts between the two ideas in an almost
perfect black and white dialect which
gets funnier as it improves day by day.
The last of the distinctly foreign is
Pomeroy, the English valet, played by
Fred Hughes. He took the part of Tipu,
the sovereign sultan in "Maid to Order"
last year, and was very successful as the
dignified purely-spoken regent. A Cock
ney speech is the sine qua non of this
role, which he is learning fast enough
to be worth looking forward to.
