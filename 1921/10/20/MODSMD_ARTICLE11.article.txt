## 
### 
Tn order to give more time for bril
liant thoughts to mature in the fertile
minds of campus sages. Yell Leader
Connolly has set over the final date for
the turning in of the bleacher stunt sug
gestions to the first of the week. I his
stunt, which will be given between
halves at the big game, must be some
thing not only unusual and original, but
capable of being carried out on a much
larger scale than ever before attempted,
to merit consideration. The lirst prize
to be awarded to the one handing in the
best stunt, will be $10. The second prize
is $5. Suggestions may be handed in
either to R. C. Connolly or Homer
Mitchell.
