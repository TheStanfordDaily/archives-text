# FINAL ROOF WORK ON NEW ONION TO START
## Basketball Men Inspect Floor For Pavillion; Training Quarter Space is Allotted 
### 
A type of roof of slightly livelier and
more mixed tile than that used on the
Library building, has been decided on
for the new Union in an agreement be
tween Comptroller Roth and Gladding
and Mc√üean, roofers, after a confer
ence yesterday afternoon. The work on
the covering of the main roof and ar
cades of the Union will start imme
diately, as it is planned to have the
building completely finished by the first
of the year.
The Union is to be finished on the
outside in plaster colored as nearly as
possible to match the tint of the sand
stone in the Quad edifices. It is prob
able that the other buildings which will
comprise the other two sides of the
miniature quad will be painted the same
way.
Work 011 the cork walls of the re
frigerating plant has begun, initiating
the installation, by Mangrum and Otter,
of kitchen equipment said to be the very
latest in convenience and labor saving
devices. A complete bakeshop is one of
the items of the new cuisine.
Cement walks of the checker-board
pattern, alternate red and white cement,
are being laid in the arcades adjoining
the Union building, the pattern having
been chosen to brighten up the vistas
made possible by this type of architec
ture.
Comptroller Roth announced that

pavilion will begin inside of two weeks.

slabs is being set in place. \\ hen this
hardens work 011 the insulation of the
