# POLO TEAMS CHOOSE SIDES AND CAPTAINS
## 
### 
Sides and captains for the four polo
teams which will compete on the Stan
ford polo field were chosen this after
noon. The teams are to practice shots,
defense, passing, etc., on Mondays and
Wednesdays, and matches will be played
on Fridays. Each team will be in four
two seven minute periods, the four
teams being alternately matched against
each other. At the close of the quarter
a winner will be decided on as a result
of the matches played.
It is hoped that polo will soon be made
a minor sport, with regular minor sport
recognition.
