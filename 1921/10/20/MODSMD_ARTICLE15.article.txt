# DEEP STUFF ON MENU AS FLEET CONTEST NEARS
## Fans Get Gate When Varsity Takes Offense in Workout With Seay's "Fresh" Team 
### 
Gene Van Gent must have given the
football squad some deep stuff last night
in preparation for the important Pacific
Fleet battle here Saturday.
Duffy Seay brought his freshmen
warriors on the field for a workout witli
the varsity. As long as the 1925 men
had the hall the boys up in the bleachers
were allowed inside the park. When the
varsity went on the offensive the watch
men scooted everyone out.
What went on behind the closed gates
is a mystery, but it's a good guess that
the Stanford gridders were given some
dope tended to throw a scare into the
ranks of "Big Bill" Ingram and his co
horts.
Joe Douglas, the husky guard, is defi
nitely out of Saturday's fray and for
longer perhaps, lie has a torn ligament
in his shoulder and was carrying his
arm in a sling last night, llarley Car
ter, the big fellow who has been show
ing them all how tackle should be
played, is still limping badly and wasn't
in the scrimmage last night. He may be
out of the Pacific Fleet encounter also.
The Cards will undoubtedly have a
bag full of tricks to use on the visitors
Saturday, for it's a cinch that Van Gent
and the other coaches are not having se
cret drills for the fun of it.
Picking the Stanford lineup for the
fleet game is still a guessing game. The
backfield is more or less certain with
Bob Shlaudeman doped to start at quar
ter, Art Wilcox and Ray Doughty at
halfs, and Captain Jack Patrick at full.
In case Doughty's injuries are such that
Van Gent won't take a chance on him,
"Bud" Woodward will bark the signals
and Shlaudeman will move to half.
"Shorty" Mertz apparently has his job
at left end pretty well tied up. lie has
looked good all season and his work
against the Olympics was all that could
be asked. The other wing position looks
to be a tossup between "Kewp" Sproull
and "Swede" Larson witli Pershing stilt
hampered by injuries sustained in prac
tice.
Fred Ludeke looks due to start at one
of the tackles. Carter will surely open
up at the other provided he is able to
navigate. "Scotchy" Campbell is a sure
shot to get in there somewhere.
Dud De Groot looks to be the logical
selection at guard with "Red" Bctts as
his running mate. Faville is doped for
center.
Reports today from the Pacific Fleet
stronghold were to the effect that In
gram and his outfit are working des
perately for the Card game. They figure
to have a better chance to beat Van
Gent's team than they did to wallop
California.
Graduate Manager W. D. Fletcher has
announced that the game will start at 3
o'clock and that student cards will ad
mit to both the freshmen and varsity
affairs.

warriors on the field for a workout witli
the varsity. As long as the 1925 men
had the hall the boys up in the bleachers
were allowed inside the park. When the
varsity went on the offensive the watch
men scooted everyone out.
What went on behind the closed gates
is a mystery, but it's a good guess that
the Stanford gridders were given some
dope tended to throw a scare into the
ranks of "Big Bill" Ingram and his co
horts.
Joe Douglas, the husky guard, is defi
nitely out of Saturday's fray and for
longer perhaps, lie has a torn ligament
in his shoulder and was carrying his
arm in a sling last night, llarley Car
ter, the big fellow who has been show
ing them all how tackle should be
played, is still limping badly and wasn't
in the scrimmage last night. He may be
out of the Pacific Fleet encounter also.
The Cards will undoubtedly have a
bag full of tricks to use on the visitors
Saturday, for it's a cinch that Van Gent
and the other coaches are not having se
cret drills for the fun of it.
Picking the Stanford lineup for the
fleet game is still a guessing game. The
backfield is more or less certain with
Bob Shlaudeman doped to start at quar
ter, Art Wilcox and Ray Doughty at
halfs, and Captain Jack Patrick at full.
In case Doughty's injuries are such that
Van Gent won't take a chance on him,
"Bud" Woodward will bark the signals
and Shlaudeman will move to half.
"Shorty" Mertz apparently has his job
at left end pretty well tied up. lie has
looked good all season and his work
against the Olympics was all that could
be asked. The other wing position looks
to be a tossup between "Kewp" Sproull
and "Swede" Larson witli Pershing stilt
hampered by injuries sustained in prac
tice.
Fred Ludeke looks due to start at one
of the tackles. Carter will surely open
up at the other provided he is able to
navigate. "Scotchy" Campbell is a sure
shot to get in there somewhere.
Dud De Groot looks to be the logical
selection at guard with "Red" Bctts as
his running mate. Faville is doped for
center.
Reports today from the Pacific Fleet
stronghold were to the effect that In
gram and his outfit are working des
perately for the Card game. They figure
to have a better chance to beat Van
Gent's team than they did to wallop
California.
Graduate Manager W. D. Fletcher has
announced that the game will start at 3
o'clock and that student cards will ad
mit to both the freshmen and varsity
affairs.
Gene Van Gent must have given the
football squad some deep stuff last night
in preparation for the important Pacific
Fleet battle here Saturday.
