# How Many Do You Know?

Way back in the grade schools a scholar usually
acquires the idea that his teacher is superhumanâ€”
someone to be looked at from a distance but not to
be approached on familiar grounds. As he advances
along the road of knowledge this idea sticks, and
to it are added small grudges from supposed wrongs
suffered at the hands of the dread master who inflicts
hard tasks on the already abused scholar.
This feeling persists to a large extent after the
scholar becomes a student in some university. He
still sees in the professor and instructor the advanced
prototype of the first-grade teacher. Here is a man
who has made a searching study of a special field.
He is an authority and is therefore not to be ap
proached by the student. By the tasks he imposes
he is rated as a "good prof" or a "tough prof," and
his courses are either "lunches" or tough ones. But
there the student's research ends. The old feeling
of master and slave still exists, and he makes no
effort to meet his professors or instructors on com
iou grounds. He does not try to become acquainted
ut is content to know them from the seat which
e occupies in the classroom. He does not bother to
:arn whether they are interested in topics that are
ital to student life. To the student the name Pro
sssor X signifies chemistry or law or some other
>ranch of education.
Professors, like the rest of us, are distinctly hu
man. Cultivate them. Do not save your visits to
their offices until you have received a minus in a
course. Drop in on them some day when they ap
pear to be the least busy and buzz them about the
football situation, world disarmament, or the chances
of the Giants to repeat in the World's Series next
season. You will find that every professor has some
distinct hobby. It will probably correlate with an
interest of your own. A friendship will be formed
that not only will be a benefit to you but the under
standing thus established will serve to narrow the
breach that now exists between the faculty and the
students.
The faculty of Stanford has demonstrated that it
is willing to meet the students on common grounds
through its annual barbecue and baseball game with
the seniors each spring. But do not wait until you
are a senior to become acquainted with these men.
Greet them on quad with "Hello" the same way you
do when you meet one of the student body. The
effect will be that the faculty, which always backs
the students in every enterprise, will be drawn even
closer to the undergraduate body, and the result
will be a greater Stanford family.
