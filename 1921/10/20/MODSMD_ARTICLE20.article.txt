# Staff Appointments
## 
### 
Fifteen new members have been added to the
Reportorial Staff of the Daily Palo Alto as the result
of tryouts covering two weeks, which ended yester
day. Sixty-five men and women responded to a
call for tryoutees, and at the end of the first week
this number was reduced to thirty-four, from which
fifteen were finally selected to become members of
the staff.
Because of the unusually large turnout of jour
nalistic aspirants it was found exceedingly difficult
to pick the fifteen to fill the vacancies. Candidates
were judged on three counts: first, on being able to
write in correct and concise English; second, ability
shown in covering the assignments given out during
the tryout period; third, the ability to gather news
not regularly assigned.
The Daily takes pleasure in announcing the ap
pointments of Leon T. David '25, Pearl Bundick '23,
Chesley M. Douglas '23, Donald E. Liebendorfer
'24, Winifred Johnston '22, Harold N. Morris '25,
Helen Broughall '25, Charles Fueller '25, Alice De
ment '22, Margaret Grill '24, Robert Boynton '25,
Wana Keesling '25, Daniel Gage '24, Helen Brant
'24, and Henry Mack, '24.
