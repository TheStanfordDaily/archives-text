Hugo, the postprandial moth, was in to see us last
night and remarked that Patrick ought to be sued for
running down Ewing field.

t See where Berkeley rooters want to hire a box car
to go north. Might be a good thing if they hired eleven
boxes in advance for the trip south, November 19.

Dear Head of Cabbage: —
Last week you asked me to write for you and I said
"Righto," and then you turned in to make a monkey
out of me, as if nature didn't do a good enough job.
If mother hadn't taught me to count a million first I'da
knocked you for a fire-escape then and there. But while
I was busy counting I noticed you got your colyum
widened in order to better accommodate my verse, for
which I want to thank you, and quit counting and say,
you sure know a good man when you see him.

My motto is "Women and Children First," so I'm
going to start the section gang today with a few words
about the little ones.

A DINK
or "A Freshman's Lament"
A raspberrie upon a wad of gum,
That's stuck up there upon my cranium,
Is called a Dink. I well believe its name
Is really all that's good about the same.
For when the sweltering sun is heated red
A cooling somb upon a senior's head
Is cruelty to me and my poor pate,
As I dejectedly must contemplate
That all my handkerchiefs are dripping wet
With wiping trickling rivulets of sweat,
And when it rains my specs get dripping wet,
I brush my windshield every block. And yet,
The Quad is arched. Oh glory be for that!
Until I do attain a pious hat!
Oh, I have got my finery and crown,
Poor Prosh, methinks I'm rigged up like a clown,
With raspberries upon a wad of gum,
That's stuck up there upon my cranium.

Now read ye the tale of the sweet little damsel and
how she held the mighty football hero for downs when
a score looked certain.
♦ * *
Slowly but surely he had been moving up the field.
* * *
You can now hardly see the moonlight on the couch
between them.
* * *
He decided to play straight football. His arms stole
around her waist.
* * *
"I penalize you fifteen yards for holding," she said.
"But, er, I didn't, I only meant to—"
* * #
"Penalize you fifteen more for crawling," she snapped.
her nose as high as a fullback's kicking toe.
* * *
Back he was again in the middle of the field. Time
was getting short. He'd have to resort to open field
work. But he tried once more to get back on straight
stuff. But she had a wonderful "line." She stopped
him dead in his tracks.
* * *
Then he made a "pass' about that old gag, how he
wondered is she'd say yes if he proposed.
* # *
But she intercepted that with a "If you thought so,
would you propose?"
* * *
Baffled and beaten he decided on the end —to run.
But she had her interference working. He knew now
she cared!
* * *
With a mighty desperation he kicked the ball sixty
yards over the goal-posts, for the winning score.
H> He *
Yes, married now, and have been playing a kicking
game ever since.

"And since the color we must wear,
Is England's cruel red,
Old Ireland's sons will ne'er forget
The blood that they have shed."
—"The Wearing of the Green."

What, ho, the guard! God save the king! What's in
a name! Look who is going to lead the Red warriors
to battle this fall. Patrick heads the varsity and Dennis
the frosh. To the top of the morning to them, shure, and
they're fine lads, but what names to be fighting in those
bloody shirts!
* * *
Faith, an' they might be off-color but what names they
are! "Pesky" Sprott's outfit's name will be Dennis when
Guy's gang gets through with them and the varsity will
give Cal what Paddy gave the drum.

BOWL 'EM OVER. SPADES ARE TRUMPS!
