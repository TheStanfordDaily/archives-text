# STANFORD BOXERS TO HAVE HARD SCHEDULE
## 
### 
Stanford's coterie of boxers will
have a hard time of it during next
month if Jimmy Ross, '23, and Bill
Burkhardt, '23, have their way about
it.
Ross and Burkhardt, both members
of the varsity boxing team last year,
are acting as instructors this season
and they have been as busy as bees
lining up the 150 or more candidates.
Ross is in charge of the advanced
classes, men who have had experience,
and Burkliadt is handling the begin
ners.
Jlie first tournament of the year will
be staged in about three weeks, ac
cording to an announcement today.
Immediately after the class battles a
weight tournament will be started.
Winners of the final events in this
class will be awarded cups, to be pre
sented by Palo Alto merchants.
Besides Ross, who fights at 135
pounds and Burkhardt who weighs
145 pounds, there will be three veter
ans from last year's squad back in
the Card fold this season. They are
Mark Evans, '20, "Husky" Wassum,
'21, and Hawley Carter, '23. Carter
is at present playing football, but will
be ready for the â€¢ ring game by the
time the California tournament ltoves
around, next quarter.
Arrangements have been made for a
boxing tourney with Santa Clara, late
this, quarter.
The Stanford instructors say they
have unearthed some likely looking
prospects already, this year. Kenneth
Shipp, '23, Jack Fishburn, '24, and
Albert Bateman, '23, have all shown
class in early workouts, and Ross is
of the opinion that they will develop
into good mitt-artists.
