# California Freshman Team Handicapped By Injuries
## 
### Pacific Intercollegiate News Service 
University of California, Oct. 19.â€”
Freshman football hopes have been
somewhat dimmed by the injuries of
some of the stellar players. Schabarun,
Spaulding and Helflicker are out of the
game indefinitely, but Coach "Pesky"
Sprott has some promising players to
substitute for them. Crammer will fill
in nicely at the tackle position, and Kelly
and Dixon have shown ability as back
held men.
