# ON THE KICK-OFF
## 
### 
Krogness, the famous Harvard ath
lete, was out on the field last night
watching the Cardinal Varsity .work. He
was with "Dink" Templeton and Joe
Fitzgerald. Krogness has a mark of six
feet four inches in the high jump, and
is a noted hurdler. He placed in both
the I. C. A. A. A. A. and the National
championship meets last year.

They are calling Fred Ludeke the
burly line man on Van Gent's squad the
"hawk." The way the big fellow was
following that ball last Saturday leads
us to believe; that the name isn't so far
fetched at that.
* * *
Coach Van Gent slipped one over on
the bleacher following last night when
he ran them out of the field as soon as
the varsity took the ball for the offen
sive work. The Card mentor isn't tak
ing any chances that the Pacific Meet
aggregation gets a line on any of his
plays as he realizes that Bill Ingram and
his navy players will give him enough
trouble the way it is.

Huffy Seay has given his freshmen
players numbers and the 1925 men were
out 011 the held last night all decked out.
Guy Dennis, the stocky little skipper of
the freshmen,, is wearing number 1.
* * *
Charley Helser, one of the veterans
from last year's varsity may be out of
the game for the rest of the season as
lie is still suffering from an attack of
pleurisy. Helser was going good and his
removal from the game will be a blow
to the Card mentors.

Jack Patrick was getting off some
pretty boots last night before practice.
He was averaging close to fifty yards.
Then to show the boys he hadn't for
gotten anything, "Dink" Templeton pro
ceeded to send a few around the sixty
live yard mark.

Word comes from Los Angeles that
"Gloomy Gus" Henderson, head coach
at the University of Southern Califor
nia, has two sets of backs. One he uses
for bucking the line and is composed of
heavy players; the other for fast, open
work which consists of speedy men.
Henderson has such men as Captain
Dean, Leadingham, Tiernan, Dolly, Kin
caid, Leahy, Campbell, Lockett and Gal
loway in his backfield. U. S. C. plays
California at Berkeley on November 5.
