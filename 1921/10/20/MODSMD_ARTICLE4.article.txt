# SOCCER VARSITY TO MEET BARBARIANS
## Improvement Shown in Teamwork and Goal Shooting; Coach Expects Fast Game 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's varsity soccer
eleven will once more be called upon to
test their superiority when they meet
the San Francisco Barbarians on the
soccer field Saturday afternoon. Al
though California succeeding in beating
the Barbs by a 3-0 score, the San Fran
ciscans have a team of high caliber, and
the reports have it that they arc plan
ning a come-back. Last season they had
a fine combination and were runners up
in the University and Club Soccer
League. They have practically the same
team this year and should give the var
sity a good fight. The game will take
place on the Encina turf and will start
at 2 :30.
The Stanford varsity is, however,
ready for its opponents. The squad has
been scrimmaging with the freshmen
this week and great improvement has
been shown. Coach Maloney has been
centering his time on team work and in
perfecting the goal shooting. All dur
ing the week he has been trying out new
men and new combinations. New men
who have shown anything in the way of
soccer have been given a chance to
show what they could do. Coach Ma
loney plans to have the varsity, as al
ways, play the offensive game.
That the Stanford backfield is in more
than midseason form is easily seen in
the scrimmages. Walters at left full and
Mendonca at right are both wonderful
kickers and are real artists at the game.
They are accurate in placing the ball,
and work together with an easy smooth
ness. Masters backs up the Cardinal de
fence at goal. He has played that posi
tion for three consecutive seasons, and is
always on the spot to block a long shot.
When the goal is rushed, be is sure to
be found in the most needed place.
Captain Bill Gorman is playing an un
usually fast game this season. Holding
down the position of center half, he is
a tower of strength. He constantly
rushes the ball, and is as good on the
offensive as he is on the defensive. His
well-placed kicks generally give his for
wards an advantage over the opposing
team. Peavy and Sanders on the line
deserve special credit. They are always
pressing the offensive and arc both the
possessors of wicked boots. Peavy is
especially good at rushing the goal.
Franklin, a new man this season, has
been showing up well in the practice
matches. He plays center forward and
will probably get a chance at the Bar
barians.
Coach Maloney will definitely an
nounce the varsity lineup tomorrow.
