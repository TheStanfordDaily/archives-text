# CARD YEARLINGS DRILL HARD FOR SELMA CONTEST
## Seay Gives Men Practice in Tackling; Carrying Ball in Second Varsity Scrimmage 
### 
Coach Seay's yearlings went to the
showers last night with a stiff workout
chalked up to their credit, consisting of
some stiff tackling practice, carrying the
ball, and a scrimmage with the second
varsity squad.
Throughout the scrimmage the Babes
were given the ball and played on the
offensive. That is, they were given the
ball part of the time, but most of the
time they kept it on their own yard
gaining merits and did not need any
gifts. From the way they consistently
gained ground against Van Gent's sec
ond machine everything points to a quick
dispatch of the Selma High eleven when
the two clash on the local field Satur
day as a preliminary Varsity-Pacilic
Fleet game.
Seay has been working Wheat, Mc-
Crorie and Wittenberg in the backfield
and they show to good advantage.
Wheat, at quarter, is an able field gen
eral, charges low and hits hard. Cap
tain Dennis, who has played quarter
thus far, is a lighter from the first to
the final gun and if these two men con
tinue to improve it will be hard to choose
the one to direct the attack against the
Bruin Babes. MeCroric has been work
ing in Cuddeback's place at full and
had displayed some real ability at open
field running, together with strong line
charging. Cuddeback has proven his
value as a line plunger and kicker, and
apparently has his position cinched, but
McCrorie would prove a life-saver in
case of injury to the big back with the
wonder boot.
During the tackling practice, Harman
stood out as the surest tackier on the
squad. This husky little giant leaves his
feet for a long dive, gets them below
the knee§, and puts such a death-clamp
on their running machinery that he
flops them like tenpins. Captain Dennis
and Cuddeback are both consistent
tacklers and hit their men with a ven
geance. Wheat is one of the most elusive
men on the squad and uses the straight
arm to good advantage.
Selma High is doped to have a light
line but a clever overhead game. If this
is straight news which floats in from
the visiting camp, Saturday's game will
reveal whether Seay's proteges have im
proved on the working and blocking of
the overhead game. Another weakness
of the Babes has been that they do not
hold their man after he is tackled. It
ha been taking from two to three men
to completely stop an opponent, and con
sequently a good deal of needless yard
age has been piled up against them.
That is probably the reason for the
amount of attention which Coach Seay
has been putting on tackling and block
ing. Practice of this kind does not show
results in a day or two but it should
begin to show up from now on. Satur
day's game will test the freshmen in
these two angles of play.
Numbers for the first-year men have
arrived and will be worn in Saturday's
game. A list of the men and their num
bers will be published in tomorrow's
Daily.

squad. This husky little giant leaves his
feet for a long dive, gets them below
the knee§, and puts such a death-clamp
on their running machinery that he
flops them like tenpins. Captain Dennis
and Cuddeback are both consistent
tacklers and hit their men with a ven
geance. Wheat is one of the most elusive
men on the squad and uses the straight
arm to good advantage.
Selma High is doped to have a light
line but a clever overhead game. If this
is straight news which floats in from
the visiting camp, Saturday's game will
reveal whether Seay's proteges have im
proved on the working and blocking of
the overhead game. Another weakness
of the Babes has been that they do not
hold their man after he is tackled. It
ha been taking from two to three men
to completely stop an opponent, and con
sequently a good deal of needless yard
age has been piled up against them.
That is probably the reason for the
amount of attention which Coach Seay
has been putting on tackling and block
ing. Practice of this kind does not show
results in a day or two but it should
begin to show up from now on. Satur
day's game will test the freshmen in
these two angles of play.
Numbers for the first-year men have
arrived and will be worn in Saturday's
game. A list of the men and their num
bers will be published in tomorrow's
Daily.
Coach Seay's yearlings went to the
showers last night with a stiff workout
chalked up to their credit, consisting of
some stiff tackling practice, carrying the
ball, and a scrimmage with the second
varsity squad.
Throughout the scrimmage the Babes
were given the ball and played on the
offensive. That is, they were given the
ball part of the time, but most of the
time they kept it on their own yard
gaining merits and did not need any
gifts. From the way they consistently
gained ground against Van Gent's sec
ond machine everything points to a quick
dispatch of the Selma High eleven when
the two clash on the local field Satur
day as a preliminary Varsity-Pacilic
Fleet game.
Seay has been working Wheat, Mc-
Crorie and Wittenberg in the backfield
and they show to good advantage.
Wheat, at quarter, is an able field gen
eral, charges low and hits hard. Cap
tain Dennis, who has played quarter
thus far, is a lighter from the first to
the final gun and if these two men con
tinue to improve it will be hard to choose
the one to direct the attack against the
Bruin Babes. MeCroric has been work
ing in Cuddeback's place at full and
had displayed some real ability at open
field running, together with strong line
charging. Cuddeback has proven his
value as a line plunger and kicker, and
apparently has his position cinched, but
McCrorie would prove a life-saver in
case of injury to the big back with the
wonder boot.
During the tackling practice, Harman
stood out as the surest tackier on the
squad. This husky little giant leaves his
feet for a long dive, gets them below
the knee§, and puts such a death-clamp
on their running machinery that he
flops them like tenpins. Captain Dennis
