# Freshmen Tour Memorial Church Under Dr. Gardner
## 
### 
Another group of freshmen had the
pleasure of being conducted through the
Memorial Church yesterday afternoon by
Dr. Gardner. Although the time alloted
for the tour was short, Dr. Gardner feels
that the members of the party thor
oughly enjoyed the sections of the
church that they were able to cover. He
was pleased with the number of new
students that evinced an interest in the
campus chapel, there being about thirty
present. There will be another tour this
afternoon for those who have not had
the opportunity of visiting the church
as vet.
