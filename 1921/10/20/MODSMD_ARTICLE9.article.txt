# COACH DELIVERS CHALK TALK ON GRID TECHNIQUE
## Powell Explains Elements of American Football at First of Nestoria Lecture Series 
### 
Coach Powell addressed a roomfull
of seekers of football knowledge yes
terday evening, when he delivered the
first of a series of lectures on "The
Technique of American Football," in
Room 214. The meeting was held
under the auspices of Nestoria Debat
ing Society.
Starting with the ball as it left the
kickoff, Coach Powell diagrammed on
the blackboard the first essentials
which both teams must be concerned
with when the play starts. How the
ball should be kicked, where the men
on the opposing team should be placed
to receive it, and how the interference
must be formed to run the ball back,
were all explained by the coach.
The two things which a player must
have if he is to be any success at all
in American football, according .to
Coach Powell, are, first, proper knowl
edge of blocking, and second, the
ability to tackle low and well. Another
important thing which he emphasized
was the necessity of holding on to
the ball when tackled; a practice
which is just the opposite to rugby
playing. Therefore, a forward pass
is always dangerous, as it leaves the
ball free momentarily, to be caught
by whoever can do so.
Coach Powell declared that he be
lieved the kicking game was not used
enough by most teams. With a good
punter and a strong defense, the ene
my's goal line can be neared without
wearing out the backfield men so that
the last five yards to go finds them
spent and unable to carry the ball
over. A few simple plays, such as the
off-tackle buck and a style of forward
pass, were diagrammed on the board.
The next of this series of four lec
tures will be held in Room 214, next
Wednesday evening, and everyone is
invited to attend. Then Coach Van
Gent will speak on the subject of
"Straight Football."
