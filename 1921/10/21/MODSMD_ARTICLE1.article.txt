# VAN GENT'S ELEVEN TO BATTLE WITH MARINERS
## Cardinal Lineup is Still Uncertain; Coach May Keep All Injured Men Out of Final Pre-Conference Game 
### 
When "Big Bill" Ingram, with his set
of Pacific Fleet footballers and the Stan
ford Varsity tangle on the Cardinal turf
tomorrow afternoon, grid followers here
should see the best non-conference game
of the season.
Both teams are set for the fracas.
Van Gent will be handicapped by the
loss of several men through injuries. He
may decide to keep others out of the
game tomorrow rather than take a
chance of dropping more important con
ference affairs.
Tonight it looks like a toss-up. The
Pacific Fleet must be feared. They are
strong, experienced and have been well
coached. All that the men on the team

have to do is to play football. For that
reason they have to be in the best of
shape.
They look good but if the Stanford
machine plays as well as it did a week
ago against the Olympic Club, it should
win. That was the consensus of opinion
on the campus today.
On paper the game should be won by
about one touchdown. Both teams will
be forced to open up and the fans will
probably see some of the things that
have been going on behind closed doors
on the Stanford field during the past
week.
Stanford will have to watch one man
in particular tomorrow. He is Bill In
gram, former Annapolis star. While in
college he was an All-American full
back selection. He does most of the line
bucking, passing and all of the kicking
for the fleet aggregation. Ingram weighs
well over 200 pounds and stands about
six feet three inches in height.
The fans who went out to watch the
Card team work out last night got an
other disappointment. They got to see
"Dink" Templeton's seconds scrimmage
but as soon as the varsity squads got
ready to drill it was the air.
Joe Douglas will be out of the game
and also Charley Helser, who is on the
sick list. Harley Carter may be ready
to start. That is still a question. With
the conference games beginning a week
from tomorrow, Van Gent does not fig
ure to put a man into the game who
may get knocked out for the rest of the
season.
From all the dope available it looks
like the Cardinals will open up about
like this:
Center, Faville (32) ; right guard,
Betts (5); right tackle, Ludeke (13);
right end, Sproull (IS); left guard,
Stice (9) ; left tackle, Campbell (20) ;
left end, Mertz (14); quarter, Wood
ward (8) ; right half, Shlaudeman (3) ;
left half, Wilcox (2) ; full, Captain Pat
rick (1).
That would be leaving all of the late
members of the hospital squad off the
starting list. "Dud" DeGroot may be
in there at guard, Dick Pershing might
start at right end, Carter at tackle and
Ray Doughty at right half.
Anyway it's a free, guessing game, so
take your pick.
The freshmen-Selma game will com
mence at 1:15, and the varsity and the
Pacific Fleet are scheduled to open their
fracas at 3 o'clock. Student body cards
will be good for admittance to both
games.

of the season.
Both teams are set for the fracas.
Van Gent will be handicapped by the
loss of several men through injuries. He
may decide to keep others out of the
game tomorrow rather than take a
chance of dropping more important con
ference affairs.
Tonight it looks like a toss-up. The
Pacific Fleet must be feared. They are
strong, experienced and have been well
coached. All that the men on the team

have to do is to play football. For that
reason they have to be in the best of
shape.
They look good but if the Stanford
machine plays as well as it did a week
ago against the Olympic Club, it should
win. That was the consensus of opinion
on the campus today.
On paper the game should be won by
about one touchdown. Both teams will
be forced to open up and the fans will
probably see some of the things that
have been going on behind closed doors
on the Stanford field during the past
week.
Stanford will have to watch one man
in particular tomorrow. He is Bill In
gram, former Annapolis star. While in
college he was an All-American full
back selection. He does most of the line
bucking, passing and all of the kicking
for the fleet aggregation. Ingram weighs
well over 200 pounds and stands about
six feet three inches in height.
The fans who went out to watch the
Card team work out last night got an
other disappointment. They got to see
"Dink" Templeton's seconds scrimmage
but as soon as the varsity squads got
ready to drill it was the air.
Joe Douglas will be out of the game
and also Charley Helser, who is on the
sick list. Harley Carter may be ready
to start. That is still a question. With
the conference games beginning a week
from tomorrow, Van Gent does not fig
ure to put a man into the game who
may get knocked out for the rest of the
season.
From all the dope available it looks
like the Cardinals will open up about
like this:
Center, Faville (32) ; right guard,
Betts (5); right tackle, Ludeke (13);
right end, Sproull (IS); left guard,
Stice (9) ; left tackle, Campbell (20) ;
left end, Mertz (14); quarter, Wood
ward (8) ; right half, Shlaudeman (3) ;
left half, Wilcox (2) ; full, Captain Pat
rick (1).
That would be leaving all of the late
members of the hospital squad off the
starting list. "Dud" DeGroot may be
in there at guard, Dick Pershing might
start at right end, Carter at tackle and
Ray Doughty at right half.
Anyway it's a free, guessing game, so
take your pick.
The freshmen-Selma game will com
mence at 1:15, and the varsity and the
Pacific Fleet are scheduled to open their
fracas at 3 o'clock. Student body cards
will be good for admittance to both
games.
When "Big Bill" Ingram, with his set
of Pacific Fleet footballers and the Stan
ford Varsity tangle on the Cardinal turf
tomorrow afternoon, grid followers here
should see the best non-conference game
of the season.
