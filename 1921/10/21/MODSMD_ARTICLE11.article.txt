# Sharps vs. Flats Will Thrill Huge Crowd on Tomorrow's Battlefield
## 
### 
The Stanford band, which has hail
several workouts this season at the
games and rallies, will assemble to
morrow to furnish the music for the
Pacific Fleet-Stanford varsity football
game. Over two weeks of practice
have rounded the leather-lunged brass
wielders into trim condition, and Coach
Smith expects his cohorts to shake the
turf in undulating waves with melo
dious blasts.
The members will meet at the band
rooms at 1:00, tomorrow afternoon,
to assemble preparatory to making
the grand march on the field. No uni
forms will be required.
