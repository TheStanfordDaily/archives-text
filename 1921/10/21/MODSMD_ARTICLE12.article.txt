# BABES TO MEET SELMA GRIDMEN
## Fast Prep Eleven is Doped to Give Seay's Yearlings Hard Battle With Passing Game 
### 
Selma High School and the Cardinal
freshmen will line up against each other
tomorrow at 1:30 on the Stanford turf
as a preliminary match to the Varsity-
Pacific Fleet gridiron battle. Selma will
invade the Stanford field with a light
but fast team and a reputation for a
good passing game. The freshmen have
continually shown weakness in this de
partment of the game, and tomorrow's
game will be a test to the real strength
of the Babes.
Tonight Coach Seay will send the
freshmen through a light signal prac
tice together with some practice with
the dummy. During the week Coach
Seay has been making shifts in the
squad frequently and tomorrow's game
may see several substitutions through
out the period of play. A number of
new line prospects have been showing
up well in practice lately while Wheat,
McCrorie and Wittenberg are looming
up as contestants for places on the reg
ular lineup.
Fuller, who was hurt in practice last
Tuesday, will be missing from the lineup
tomorrow and his place will be filled by
Middleton. Middleton has improved fast
and is one of the best players out for
the end position on Coach Seay's squad.
Dickey and Wideman arc also likely
candidates for this place. Wideman has
been bothered by a lame shoulder for
the past two weeks and it is doubtful
whether he will be able to get into the
game tomorrow.
The team picked by Coach Seay and
his staff today to start the game against
the Selma High eleven is: Cuddeback,
fullback; Howard and Gilliland, half
backs ; Dennis, quarter; Janssen, left
end; Shipke, left tackle; Neill, left
guard; Van Hook, center; Crook, right
guard; Dole, right tackle; Middleton,
right end.
Numbers were given out to all men in
the first string squad yesterday and the
Babes will be able to be recognized in
the game with Selma tomorrow. The
numbers of the players are;
Dennis 1, Barnes 2, Corey 3, Crook

freshmen will line up against each other
tomorrow at 1:30 on the Stanford turf
as a preliminary match to the Varsity-
Pacific Fleet gridiron battle. Selma will
invade the Stanford field with a light
but fast team and a reputation for a
good passing game. The freshmen have
continually shown weakness in this de
partment of the game, and tomorrow's
game will be a test to the real strength
of the Babes.
Tonight Coach Seay will send the
freshmen through a light signal prac
tice together with some practice with
the dummy. During the week Coach
Seay has been making shifts in the
squad frequently and tomorrow's game
may see several substitutions through
out the period of play. A number of
new line prospects have been showing
up well in practice lately while Wheat,
McCrorie and Wittenberg are looming
up as contestants for places on the reg
ular lineup.
Fuller, who was hurt in practice last
Tuesday, will be missing from the lineup
tomorrow and his place will be filled by
Middleton. Middleton has improved fast
and is one of the best players out for
the end position on Coach Seay's squad.
Dickey and Wideman arc also likely
candidates for this place. Wideman has
been bothered by a lame shoulder for
the past two weeks and it is doubtful
whether he will be able to get into the
game tomorrow.
The team picked by Coach Seay and
his staff today to start the game against
the Selma High eleven is: Cuddeback,
fullback; Howard and Gilliland, half
backs ; Dennis, quarter; Janssen, left
end; Shipke, left tackle; Neill, left
guard; Van Hook, center; Crook, right
guard; Dole, right tackle; Middleton,
right end.
Numbers were given out to all men in
the first string squad yesterday and the
Babes will be able to be recognized in
the game with Selma tomorrow. The
numbers of the players are;
Dennis 1, Barnes 2, Corey 3, Crook
4. Cuddeback 5, Dickey 6, Dale 7, Dris
