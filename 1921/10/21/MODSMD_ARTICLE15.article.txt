# STANFORD SOCCER MEN WILL BATTLE BARBARIAN ELEVEN
## 
### 
Stanford will have two soccer
teams on the field of action tomorrow.
The varsity will stay at home to pro
tect their goal from the invading Bar
barians, while the husky freshmen
eleven will go up to Berkeley to have
a practice game with the California
varsity. Coach Maloney reports that
both teams are in good condition. He
believes that the freshmen will have
a hard battle on their hands, but be
lieves that the combination he has
picked out will give the Bruins a
worthy battle. Dope gives the var
sity a slight edge over its opponents.
The freshman game with the Cali
fornia varsity will merely be a prac
tice game, as California does not per
mit its varsities to compete with
freshman teams. This necessitates
the freshmen withdrawing from
the Club and University Soccer
league. The Babes, however, will ful
fill their schedule with the teams, but
the games will not count in the com
parative standing of the members of
the league.
On paper it looks as though the
varsity aggregation should win by at
least two points, but San Francisco
reports have it that the Barbarians
have shown much improvement in the
last week, and that they expect to
stage a comeback. They will find,
however, that they will have to go
up against a stiff proposition as the
varsity forwards have greatly im
proved their scoring machine.
Coach Maloney will not hold scrim
mage between the freshmen and var
sity teams tonight, but as final pre
parations for both squads, he will
give a chalk talk in the lecture room
of the gym.
The line-ups are:
Stanford Barbarians
Elmore lo Hindman
Sanders il Harrison
Franklin cf Thorpe
Peavy ir Albricht
Buirmbach or Hudson
Walthers lb Adamson
