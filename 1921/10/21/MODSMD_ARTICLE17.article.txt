# Wearing the Block "S"
## 
### 
Jt is not a far cry back to the days when Stanford
athletes wore a block "S" that stretched from neck to
bottom of the sweater. Every possessor of the cov
eted symbol of athletic achievement was proud to
sport it on each and every public occasion. How
ever, like times, practices also change.
Today the size of the "S" has been reduced and
placed on the left side of the jersey, where it is
thought to be less conspicuous. False modesty has
crept in, and the athlete believes that he no longer
wants to be decked out like a circus horse because he
has been a member of a winning team in a major
sport. But worse still, the sweaters are not worn
at all. Rumor, which is at best a false informant,
has it that men who are prominent in several differ
ent branches of intercollegiate athletics have trunks
lull of sweaters. Each new one is put carefully
away where'only the owner can gloat over it.
That, at best, is a deplorable practice. The Block
"S" is a symbol not only of an achievement but of
:he recognition that lias come with the achievement.
No one can doubt the value of intercollegiate ath
letic competition to a university. In order to carry
on this competition university men are forced to
sacrifice a great deal in time of training and vitality.
Possibly it is three or four years before the letter is
finally won. When it is acquired the owner should
be proud to display it. Often he fears the opinion
of the rest of the undergraduate body who through
jealousy are sometimes led to say, "He certainly is
proud of that letter he has won." We are fortu
nate that this is not heard very often.
The wearing of the Block "S" has a very decided
effect 011 the turnout of younger members of the
undergraduate body for athletics. There is a feeling
of envy in the heart of every man for the wearer
of the symbol. The appearance of more Block "S"
sweaters on the campus would increase this envy to
the point where even greater competition for posi
tions on varsity teams would be had.
The whole idea which is so prevalent in regard
to wearing the block letter is'artificial. The way to
overcome it is for every man who has been so hon
ored by the award to wear it constantly. A flood of
Block "S" sweaters on the campus would revive the
practice.
Skull and Snakes is instituting a campaign to bring
back the custom of wearing athletic award sweaters
on the campus. Every possessor of an award should
sport it every day of the week, and more especially
on Wednesdays and Saturdays, which have been
selected as pivotal days upon which the custom is to
be revived. Every possessor of a sweater and letter
of any kind should wear it to the game tomorrow.

has been a member of a winning team in a major
sport. But worse still, the sweaters are not worn
at all. Rumor, which is at best a false informant,
has it that men who are prominent in several differ
ent branches of intercollegiate athletics have trunks
lull of sweaters. Each new one is put carefully
away where'only the owner can gloat over it.
That, at best, is a deplorable practice. The Block
"S" is a symbol not only of an achievement but of
:he recognition that lias come with the achievement.
No one can doubt the value of intercollegiate ath
letic competition to a university. In order to carry
on this competition university men are forced to
sacrifice a great deal in time of training and vitality.
Possibly it is three or four years before the letter is
finally won. When it is acquired the owner should
be proud to display it. Often he fears the opinion
of the rest of the undergraduate body who through
jealousy are sometimes led to say, "He certainly is
proud of that letter he has won." We are fortu
nate that this is not heard very often.
The wearing of the Block "S" has a very decided
effect 011 the turnout of younger members of the
undergraduate body for athletics. There is a feeling
of envy in the heart of every man for the wearer
of the symbol. The appearance of more Block "S"
sweaters on the campus would increase this envy to
the point where even greater competition for posi
tions on varsity teams would be had.
The whole idea which is so prevalent in regard
to wearing the block letter is'artificial. The way to
overcome it is for every man who has been so hon
ored by the award to wear it constantly. A flood of
Block "S" sweaters on the campus would revive the
practice.
Skull and Snakes is instituting a campaign to bring
back the custom of wearing athletic award sweaters
on the campus. Every possessor of an award should
sport it every day of the week, and more especially
on Wednesdays and Saturdays, which have been
selected as pivotal days upon which the custom is to
be revived. Every possessor of a sweater and letter
of any kind should wear it to the game tomorrow.
