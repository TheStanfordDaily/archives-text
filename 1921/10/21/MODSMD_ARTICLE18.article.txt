# Honor System Infractions
## 
### 
Infractions against the Honor System have al
ready been recorded and dealt with by the Men's
Council. Several of these were minor offenses, but
nevertheless serious enough to merit action by that
student committee.
The Honor System was thoroughly explained
upon its installation last spring quarter, but there
seem to be several minor points that require inter
pretation.
In the first place it is just what its name implies.
The emphatic word in the name is honor. You are,
under the system, placed upon your honor to not
only shoot square on all scholastic matters, but to see
that others do likewise. You are not made police
men or keepers of your brothers, but it is a matter
of personal integrity that you should report any
infractions that come within your knowledge. By
not reporting them you jeopardize the system which
you pledge yourself to abide by upon entering Stan
ford. You are endangering an institution which has
given you and every other student of Stanford the
chance* to say that you stand firmly on your own
feet in matters pertaining to the securing of an edu
cation.
Examinations are not the only things to which the
Honor System applies. Written work outside the

class is governed by it as well. Personal honesty
and pride should force you to prepare term papers
and other class contributions to courses which you
are studying by yourself.
Property of others should always be respected.
Three years ago it was a common practice to see
books and papers left on window ledges about the
quadrangles remain untouched for five or six months
at a stretch. Today we see notices posted or pub
lished in which someone requests sarcastically that if
some belonging is more valuable to its new owners
than it was to the old they can have it. There are
always a few irresponsible persons who do break
the rules of common honesty. That is the type that
the Men's Council wishes to stamp out.
Findings in all cases of infractions of the Honor
System will be published on the editorial page of the
Daily. The purpose is to show the student body as
a whole that the Honor System is in force here.
The Honor System is not an intangible, mythical
something that is high sounding but means nothing.
Publications of the decisions handed down will serve
to emphasize the fact that the Honor System is a
real institution.
Comment was heard following the report pub
lished on Wednesday. This case was not one of dis
honesty in an examination. Jt was a combination of
a misunderstanding and a deliberate attempt to
evade punishment by .withholding certain known
facts from the investigating body. Because of this
set of circumstances the guilty party was not expelled
from the University, but twenty hours were added
to his graduation requirements. The question raised
was one of severity. Several have expressed opin
ions that any infraction of th Honor System merits
the severest of punishments, expulsion from the
University. In a case like this one, where the entire
scope of the Honor System was not undestood it was
deemed the wise thing by the Men's Council to min
imize the punishment until every student realizes
the wide field covered by the honor plan.
Your own conscience should guide you in doing
the right thing. In case there is a doubt in your
mind as to whether a contemplated act will be a
violation of the code, figure it out for yourself. If
you are honest with yourself you will most surely
do the right thing, and the Honor System will be
planted more firmly as a Stanford institution. Any
slight discrepancy on the part of a student tends to
weaken the Honor System and will eventually bring
back the plan of supervision in classrooms and sur
veillance in outside work and actions.
