U. W. K., Cabbage-emeritus, sends a clipping from

Not content with playing the "Big Game of the Pa
cific Coast," with California, the Trojans now assume
the responsibility of editing the "best college paper in
the West." Berkeley will probably soon do her share
in removing the misapprehensions regarding the com
parative size of the California-U. S. C. game. As to the
paper—well, we're in the West and we don't feel
flattered.

SO THEY KEEP 'EM IN CAPTIVITY.
The article goes on to say, "Boasting the prettiest
sob sisters in captivity and the most popular staff of
reporters in the state . . . etc." which goes to show

we get going. With their beauty and our popularity

One of the Northern contemporaries has remarked
that after the Cards meet the team from the college
he represents, they'll start a "Back to the Farm" move
