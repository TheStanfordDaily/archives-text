# LIGHTWEIGHT ELEVEN WILL HAVE GRIDIRON
## 
### 
Members competing for the 135-lb.
football team will soon have a gridiron
|on which to practice instead of the
I polo field now being used. A field
east of the freshman gridiron is being
put into condition by the athletic de
partment. Goal posts were set up
last night, and the rather thin turf
will be revived as much as possible.
The turnout for the 135-lb. team
has been so large and the prospects
jso good that Director Powell has
promised the candidates a genuine
I coach who will train them in.the grid
iron art. On account of the scarcity
! of suits, several of the men have put
! in orders at the gymnasium store for
footbal outfits which they will pay for
themselves, a liberal discount being
all wed. Last night a few more men
appeared in suits on the polo field, and
also enough additional football aspi
rants to form three large squads.
Former candidates for the Varsity
now out for the 135-lb. aggregation
took charge of practice and ran the
i squads through elementary signal
! drills.
