# ON THE KICK-OFF
## 
### 
Two Pacific Conference games are on
the football menu for tomorrow. Over
at Berkeley Andy Smith's Bruins tackle
the University of Oregon and, accord
ing to all dope, should emerge victorious
by a big score. The University of Wash
ington will meet the Oregon Aggies at
Seattle.
* * *
That the entire membership of the
Pacific Fleet will invade the Stanford
campus tomorrow was the word that
reached here today. The fleet will bring
down a band and about a thousand sail
ors to help Bill Ingram's outfit along.
The sailors will have their own rooting
section and several cheer leaders.
* * *
The "ghost ball" will soon be intro
duced to the varsity squad if it hasn't
been used already in those mysterious
sessions behind barred doors. The
"ghost ball" is similar to the regulation
pigskin except that it is painted white in
order that it may be seen after darkness
set over the field .
* * *
Bob Shlaudeman is probably the clev
erest broken field runner on Van Gent's
big squad. Against the Olympic Club
Shlaudeman would consistently make
long returns on punts despite the fact
that the winged "O" ends were often
waiting for him to catch* the ball. An
other thing that makes Shlaudeman val
uable is the fact that he is seldom forced
to take time out. Some of the boys in
the bleachers were saying that he has
never taken out a minute's time in any
game since he has been wearing the
Cardinal jersey.
* * *
"Bud" Woodward's way of calling
signals is a treat. He has a way all of
liis own, every syllable being easily
heard clear up at the top of the stands.
* * *
"California is preparing for the Stan
ford game primarily," said Coach Andy
Smith the other day. "We would like
to win all of our contests this year, but
it's the 'Big Game' that we must win."
* * *
Stanford has more coaches this year
than the institution has ever had. With
Van Gent, Canning, Fitzgerald and
Templeton handling the varsity and
Scay, Malarkey, Feeney and Cravens in
charge of the freshmen, every man on
both squads has had an opportunity to
get the best there is in the coaching line
this year.
