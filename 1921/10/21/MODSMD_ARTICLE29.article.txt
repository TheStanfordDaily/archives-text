## 
### 
Owing to the fact that funds appro
priated for the purpose are exhausted,
the navy department has been compelled
to muster out those men who are mem
bers of the naval reserve. Over a score
of Stanford students who were enrolled
in this branch of the navy are affected
by the order, receiving notices of the
change in status today. In place of
maintaining a definite reserve branch
of the navy, the department is urging
all reservists who are mustered out to
join a volunteer reserve of the state in
which they reside, in which they serve
without pay.
