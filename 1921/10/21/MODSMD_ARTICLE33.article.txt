University of Oregon's football squad
of seventeen men are now in Berkeley,
where they are to mix with the Bruin
team tomorrow. The Oregon team has
been making a hard tight to put the
team in shape for the tussle Saturday,
and "Shy" Huntington, head coach of
the lemon-yellow aggregation, expects
to give the Bruins a hard battle.
This will be the seventh battle be
tween the two universities. Huntington
has been having his difficulties with the
hospital staff, and Billy Reinhart will
be unable to take his accustomed place
in the Oregon backlield, as his collar
bone is broken. The following men are
the ones on whom Oregon is basing her
hopes: Mart Howard, Ward Johnson,
"Dutch" Gramm, George King, Len
Jordan, "Chuck" Parsons, "Tiny"
Shields, Floyd Shields, "Prink" Calli
son, "Spike" Laslie, "Scotty" Strachan,
"Bart" Laughlin, "Hunk" Latham, Neil
Mortitt, Hal Chapman, Carl Von der
Abe.
Two more men were still to be added
to this list but were not selected until
later.
