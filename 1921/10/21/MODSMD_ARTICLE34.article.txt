# SENIORS APPROVE OF CHANGE IN '23 QUAD
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Senior Class,
held Yesterday, the class voted to
adopt the proposition of Wylie Kil
patrick, '23, that senior pictures re
place the junior pictures in the '23
Quad. The Quad has heretofore ran
the pictures of the junior class, and
the class history of the seniors, thus
taking up a large amount of valuable
space in needless duplication. The
class of '24 has also given its endorse
ment of the plan, promising to use
it in the Quad again next year.
