# CAST OF "TAILOR MADE MAN" SHOWS PROMISE
## All Players are Requested to Appear in Costume Saturday, to Be Photographed 
### 
One week from tonight will be the
brightest for women's dramatics in many
a moon. More stars will be out and
beaming upon the "Tailor Made Mail"
than any play has afforded opportunity
for in a long time. There are possibili
ties for a distinct success in at least six
women's roles.
Efficiency, speed, clinging vintage, "co
edishness," and just plain sweetness are
slated as the feminine weapons of at
tack. Each one has the chance to be the
hit of the show for there are six parts,
unique and individual, which offer un
limited chances for development. The
six women who are cast in these parts
are Dorothy Woodhead, Augusta Corey,
Mabel Ferry, Mildred Finley, Kathleen
Evans and Margaret Howard.
Dorothy Woodhead will appear as
Tanya Huber, the tailor's daughter.
Tanya is father's angel child. Although
she doesn't love the pompous doctor,
who has the further liability of author;
ship dragging him down, father puts
him over along the obedience route.
Even father can't keep a good man
down, and as tlie pressing assistant's
stock rises, the pedantic doctor's con
tract becomes more and more or a
paper promise.
Tanya is the original heroine, a shy
modest violet with a grappling acces
sory for the stray heart, the sweet de
mure maid who is a composite picture
of Miss Muffet, Pollyanna, Faith, and
perhaps even Dorothy Vernon, but she
is played by Miss Woodhead, which
promises the part character in the face
of its stock sweetness.
A direct negative to Tanya is Mrs.
Kitty DuPuy, played by Mildred Finley.
When she is about, everybody else ap
pears comatose. Miss Finley's full, rich
voice commands attention merely as
music. Her part she is improving in at
each rehearsal and now has it in a po
sition to almost serve as a model. The
widow. Miss Finley, plays is grass but
not green, but that will come up later.
Daughter Bessie is just the opposite
type. Kathleen Evans plays this part.
All of mother's extra personality is
needed to put Bessie over. Whatever
mother tells her, she says. Bessie only
faintly realizes where she is going and
that by hearsay. When mamma re
minds her she recovers long enough to
notice that things are still going on
around here. Miss Evans has a high,
timid, stage-voice which could not be
better adapted to the part. Teamed up
with mother, the DuPuys have the best
chance in the world of running away
with the show.
Flappers are represented by Mabel
Ferry, who plays Corrine Stanlaw. It is
very evident that Corrine has just "come
out," although what she came out for
remains mysterious unless it was to help
father load the dollars onto trucks. All
the rough objects to is what her char
acter is. The weekly humorous maga
zine's idea of an ingenue is what Miss
Ferry's role calls for, which she is ap
pearing very well in so far.
Augusta Corey is to appear Friday
night as Mrs. Stanlaw, the newly-rich.
While Mrs. Stanlaw does not care to
dwell on the fact that their simple man
sion cost a million, she thinks it would
he nice for good friends to know. It is
at the first big reception that the au
dience will meet her. The lorgenette is
all that is lacking, the hauteur, strut and
all the other characteristics of the so
cial climber being in great evidence.
The part of Miss Shayne, played by
Margaret Howard, tells the tale of the
efficient stenographer. Not only is every
thing done and according to rules, but
even anticipated. When dictation time
comes around it develops that the date
book is all arranged, the statements all
given to the reporters and the desks
dusted besides the letters being already
written and mailed. Those who saw
Miss Howard in the senior farce, "Clar
ence," last year, know that the part
of Miss Shayne will be played just as
it should be.
Tonight the first and third acts will
be rehearsed from 7 to 10 o'clock, in
the Assembly Hall. Pictures will be
taken tomorrow. The whole cast is
asked to be there in costume at 8 o'clock
in order that the photographer may be
finished before noon. The whole per
formance will be rehearsed Saturday
night.

Kitty DuPuy, played by Mildred Finley.
When she is about, everybody else ap
pears comatose. Miss Finley's full, rich
voice commands attention merely as
music. Her part she is improving in at
each rehearsal and now has it in a po
sition to almost serve as a model. The
widow. Miss Finley, plays is grass but
not green, but that will come up later.
Daughter Bessie is just the opposite
type. Kathleen Evans plays this part.
All of mother's extra personality is
needed to put Bessie over. Whatever
mother tells her, she says. Bessie only
faintly realizes where she is going and
that by hearsay. When mamma re
minds her she recovers long enough to
notice that things are still going on
around here. Miss Evans has a high,
timid, stage-voice which could not be
better adapted to the part. Teamed up
with mother, the DuPuys have the best
chance in the world of running away
with the show.
Flappers are represented by Mabel
Ferry, who plays Corrine Stanlaw. It is
very evident that Corrine has just "come
out," although what she came out for
remains mysterious unless it was to help
father load the dollars onto trucks. All
the rough objects to is what her char
acter is. The weekly humorous maga
zine's idea of an ingenue is what Miss
Ferry's role calls for, which she is ap
pearing very well in so far.
Augusta Corey is to appear Friday
night as Mrs. Stanlaw, the newly-rich.
While Mrs. Stanlaw does not care to
dwell on the fact that their simple man
sion cost a million, she thinks it would
he nice for good friends to know. It is
at the first big reception that the au
dience will meet her. The lorgenette is
all that is lacking, the hauteur, strut and
all the other characteristics of the so
cial climber being in great evidence.
The part of Miss Shayne, played by
Margaret Howard, tells the tale of the
efficient stenographer. Not only is every
thing done and according to rules, but
even anticipated. When dictation time
comes around it develops that the date
book is all arranged, the statements all
given to the reporters and the desks
dusted besides the letters being already
written and mailed. Those who saw
Miss Howard in the senior farce, "Clar
ence," last year, know that the part
of Miss Shayne will be played just as
it should be.
Tonight the first and third acts will
be rehearsed from 7 to 10 o'clock, in
the Assembly Hall. Pictures will be
taken tomorrow. The whole cast is
asked to be there in costume at 8 o'clock
in order that the photographer may be
finished before noon. The whole per
formance will be rehearsed Saturday
night.
One week from tonight will be the
brightest for women's dramatics in many
a moon. More stars will be out and
beaming upon the "Tailor Made Mail"
than any play has afforded opportunity
for in a long time. There are possibili
ties for a distinct success in at least six
women's roles.
Efficiency, speed, clinging vintage, "co
edishness," and just plain sweetness are
slated as the feminine weapons of at
tack. Each one has the chance to be the
hit of the show for there are six parts,
unique and individual, which offer un
limited chances for development. The
six women who are cast in these parts
are Dorothy Woodhead, Augusta Corey,
Mabel Ferry, Mildred Finley, Kathleen
Evans and Margaret Howard.
Dorothy Woodhead will appear as
Tanya Huber, the tailor's daughter.
Tanya is father's angel child. Although
she doesn't love the pompous doctor,
who has the further liability of author;
ship dragging him down, father puts
him over along the obedience route.
Even father can't keep a good man
down, and as tlie pressing assistant's
stock rises, the pedantic doctor's con
tract becomes more and more or a
paper promise.
Tanya is the original heroine, a shy
modest violet with a grappling acces
sory for the stray heart, the sweet de
mure maid who is a composite picture
of Miss Muffet, Pollyanna, Faith, and
perhaps even Dorothy Vernon, but she
is played by Miss Woodhead, which
promises the part character in the face
of its stock sweetness.
A direct negative to Tanya is Mrs.
Kitty DuPuy, played by Mildred Finley.
When she is about, everybody else ap
pears comatose. Miss Finley's full, rich
voice commands attention merely as
