# CAST OF "TAILOR MADE MAN" SHOWS PROMISE
## All Players are Requested to Appear in Costume Saturday, to Be Photographed 
### 
One week from tonight will be the
brightest for women's dramatics in many
a moon. More stars will be out and
beaming upon the "Tailor Made Mail"
than any play has afforded opportunity
for in a long time. There are possibili
ties for a distinct success in at least six
women's roles.
Efficiency, speed, clinging vintage, "co
edishness," and just plain sweetness are
slated as the feminine weapons of at
tack. Each one has the chance to be the
hit of the show for there are six parts,
unique and individual, which offer un
limited chances for development. The
six women who are cast in these parts
are Dorothy Woodhead, Augusta Corey,
Mabel Ferry, Mildred Finley, Kathleen
Evans and Margaret Howard.
Dorothy Woodhead will appear as
Tanya Huber, the tailor's daughter.
Tanya is father's angel child. Although
she doesn't love the pompous doctor,
who has the further liability of author;
ship dragging him down, father puts
him over along the obedience route.
Even father can't keep a good man
down, and as tlie pressing assistant's
stock rises, the pedantic doctor's con
tract becomes more and more or a
paper promise.
Tanya is the original heroine, a shy
modest violet with a grappling acces
sory for the stray heart, the sweet de
mure maid who is a composite picture
of Miss Muffet, Pollyanna, Faith, and
perhaps even Dorothy Vernon, but she
is played by Miss Woodhead, which
promises the part character in the face
of its stock sweetness.
A direct negative to Tanya is Mrs.
Kitty DuPuy, played by Mildred Finley.
When she is about, everybody else ap
pears comatose. Miss Finley's full, rich
voice commands attention merely as
music. Her part she is improving in at
each rehearsal and now has it in a po
sition to almost serve as a model. The
widow. Miss Finley, plays is grass but
not green, but that will come up later.
Daughter Bessie is just the opposite
type. Kathleen Evans plays this part.
All of mother's extra personality is
needed to put Bessie over. Whatever
