# JAPAN QUESTION TO BE TOPIC OF ROWELL'S TALK
## Former Editor of 'Republican' Will Discuss Attitude of Orient Towards Armament 
### 
Chester Rowell, well known as former
editor of the Fresno Republican, and
now a member of the State Railway
Commission, will deliver a lecture next
Wednesday evening on the Japanese
question. The address will he under the
auspices of the World Problems Forum
of the V. M. C. A.
Disarmament and what Japan thinks
about it will be the chief theme of Ro
well's talk. Having just returned from
a summer spent in Japan, Rowell has
much first-hand information to reveal
in the course of his lecture. He was
able to get an intimate insight into what
the Japanese really think of the scheme
to hasten world-wide peace by scraping
the machines of war, and how they be
lieve it will affect their national ex
istence if it goes through.
Japan was the last of the great pow
ers approached to accept the invitation
to the disramament conference which
will meet at Washington on November
11. Her peculiar position as a nation
which has been growing steadily in
population, but not in available territory,
makes it a matter of vital importance
to her whether she will have her future
existence safely guaranteed, and in ad
dition, have a chance to expand. Her
population has already practically
reached the limit for the territory she
has, and her viewpoint in the past has
been that expansion is inevitable, no
matter what the consequences may be.
At the coming conference disarma
ment will, therefore, i)robably be of
secondary importance to Japan if she
can get the problems of the Orifcnt
worked out to her satisfaction. She
will probably demand something in the
way of guarantees that her dreams of
an empire in the East shall not be
wrecked before she can agree to any
limitation of her military and naval
power, which has been rapidly on the
increase during the last two decades.
Rowell, from the close touch with Ja
pan in which he has been, this summer,
can explain all these matters that are
interesting the peoples of all nations at
the present time.
