# TICKET SALE FOR YEAR'S FIRST SHOW IS TOMORROW
## 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
Drawings for the "Tailor Made Man"
seats will be held tomorrow afternoon
at 1 o'clock in the Administration build
ing and Crandall's in Palo Alto. Coach
Davis says of the play that it will mark
an epoch in Stanford dramatics. It is
not that it will attempt an elevation of
campus taste, for it decidedly does noth
ing but amuse, nor does the scenery,
designed, built and lighted by students
overturn tradition, but the most promi
nent actor of his college generation will
pass with tlie dropping of the final cur
tain next Friday night. It will be Les
Seib's last appearance on the local stage.
Incidently, it will be the initial appear
ance of Miss Mildred Finley.
After three years of prominence in
campus dramatics, both as coach and
actor, Seib will complete his orbit as
an actQr in tlie "Tailor Made Man." Mis
is the story of a personality which puts
over the ideas of another man, who
failed to succeed for himself, and in put
ting them over, acquires a wife and for
tune. Seib is to play the part of John
Paul Bart, the personality.
All of the show i< built around this
one character, a fitting one for Seib to
play in bis last appearance. Although his
greatest successes have been in eccen
tric roles, and the young and inspired
tailor is comparatively a "straight" part,
Seib has polished it up and put real
character into the part.
The play that is Seib's last will intro

(luce Mildred Finley. Coach Davis says
that he expects Miss Finley to he the hit
of the evening. Her poise and grace
mark her on the stage, and her voice
commands the action with its full, me
lodious richness. The part she plays is
that of tlie wise grass widow who effi
ciently looks out for her interests and
does not run to starched collars and
tailored suits.
A severvteen-piece orchestra has been
engaged to beguile the cares of the
bookworn student during the intermis
sions. The orchestra has been further
unique in that it has been practicing for
a week already, and on music which
will no doubt amuse the other 2499 pay
ers of tuition.
The scenery is almost finished. The
set for the big reception room act alone
awaits the brush. Clyde Coakley and
Sam Vaughn will be able to scrape the
paint from their hands in a few days
and accept congratulations on the quick
est made, and if sketches can foretell,
some of the most effective scenery 011
record. All previous marks in speedy
construction have been erased by the
rush of the present mechanic's efforts.
There will be lights, and in quantity,
but the present nature of the plan for
dazzling the audience has been kept a
secret so far. Ernest Greppin, who has
charge of the illumination, promises to
confess the details soon but as yet
merely intimates that the tints will be
carefully arranged to emphasize the best
of the costuming and background.

Sam Vaughn will be able to scrape the
paint from their hands in a few days
and accept congratulations on the quick
est made, and if sketches can foretell,
some of the most effective scenery 011
record. All previous marks in speedy
construction have been erased by the
rush of the present mechanic's efforts.
There will be lights, and in quantity,
but the present nature of the plan for
dazzling the audience has been kept a
secret so far. Ernest Greppin, who has
charge of the illumination, promises to
confess the details soon but as yet
merely intimates that the tints will be
carefully arranged to emphasize the best
of the costuming and background.
Drawings for the "Tailor Made Man"
seats will be held tomorrow afternoon
at 1 o'clock in the Administration build
ing and Crandall's in Palo Alto. Coach
Davis says of the play that it will mark
an epoch in Stanford dramatics. It is
not that it will attempt an elevation of
campus taste, for it decidedly does noth
ing but amuse, nor does the scenery,
designed, built and lighted by students
overturn tradition, but the most promi
nent actor of his college generation will
pass with tlie dropping of the final cur
tain next Friday night. It will be Les
Seib's last appearance on the local stage.
Incidently, it will be the initial appear
ance of Miss Mildred Finley.
After three years of prominence in
campus dramatics, both as coach and
actor, Seib will complete his orbit as
an actQr in tlie "Tailor Made Man." Mis
is the story of a personality which puts
over the ideas of another man, who
failed to succeed for himself, and in put
ting them over, acquires a wife and for
tune. Seib is to play the part of John
Paul Bart, the personality.
All of the show i< built around this
one character, a fitting one for Seib to
play in bis last appearance. Although his
greatest successes have been in eccen
tric roles, and the young and inspired
tailor is comparatively a "straight" part,
Seib has polished it up and put real
character into the part.
The play that is Seib's last will intro

(luce Mildred Finley. Coach Davis says
that he expects Miss Finley to he the hit
of the evening. Her poise and grace
mark her on the stage, and her voice
commands the action with its full, me
lodious richness. The part she plays is
that of tlie wise grass widow who effi
ciently looks out for her interests and
does not run to starched collars and
tailored suits.
A severvteen-piece orchestra has been
engaged to beguile the cares of the
bookworn student during the intermis
sions. The orchestra has been further
unique in that it has been practicing for
a week already, and on music which
will no doubt amuse the other 2499 pay
ers of tuition.
The scenery is almost finished. The
set for the big reception room act alone
awaits the brush. Clyde Coakley and
Sam Vaughn will be able to scrape the
paint from their hands in a few days
and accept congratulations on the quick
est made, and if sketches can foretell,
some of the most effective scenery 011
record. All previous marks in speedy
