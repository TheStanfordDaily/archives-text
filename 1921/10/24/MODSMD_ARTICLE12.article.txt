of work entailed in the distribution of
these tickets, the graduate manager's of
fice requests that the following proce
dure be followed by all those desiring
cards for the rooters' section:
All organizations or groups of persons
desiring seats together must give their
registration cards to one person and
allow this person to get all the tickets.
This method of acquiring adjacent seats
is necessary because of the manner of
distributing seats which will be given
out on the lottery basis this year. There
will be no favorites. The person buying
will apply for a certain number of seats.
By this process be who gets his ticket
at 6 o'clock stands just as good a chance
of getting preferred seats as he who ap
plies at 1 o'clock, thus eliminating the
early rush and the long wait in line.
