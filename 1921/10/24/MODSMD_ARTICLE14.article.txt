# BABE CI TEAM TRIMS VISITORS BY 23-0 SCORE
## Selma High Goes Down Before Freshman Line Attack; Squads Meet on Wet Field 
### C. H. Prior, '23 
While the fans sat huddled in a cold
downpour of rain, the Stanford lirst
year gridders slipped and slid to a 23
to 0 victory over the S,clma High eleven
on the local field Saturday afternoon.
Gilliland and Shipke carried off the
starring honors of the day with Cudde
back, Howard and Dennis breaking
about even for second. Dodson, the
heavy-charging half of the prep squad,
was the only visitor deserving especial
mention in the records.
Cuddeback opened the game with a
boot to Selma's twenty-yard line and
the prep men were held flat in their
tracks. They had to kick and the first
Babe offensive started from the visitors'
thirty-five-yard line. Cuddeback started
the advance and it was a steady march
with Gilliland making the long gains.
On the fifteen-yard line Shipke came
around for twelve yards, Gilliland took
it three more, and Cuddeback carried
over for the first touchdown. Dennis
kicked the goal.
Cuddeback kicked to the twenty-yard
line and Selma attempted to make yard
age but had no success. Dodson ad
vanced for five yards, but they tried a
criss-cross and the Babes pushed them
back for five, so they kicked to the fresh
man forty-five-yard line. Cuddeback ad
vanced to the fifty-yard line, Dennis at
tempted to pass but the ball fell incom
plete, and when Cuddeback fell back to
kick, Hays made a fluke pass with the
slipping ball which lost them twenty
yards. Selma took the ball on the Babe
thirty-yard line, Dodson and Neilsen
both hit the line for no gains, Post got
away for six, and then he attempted a
drop kick which failed.
The second quarter featured an ex
change for punts with no touchdowns.
Just before the gun, Cuddeback punted
to the Selma eighteen-yard line and Dod
son got away for a forty-yard run.
With the opening of the third quarter,
Selma could not make gains so punted to
the freshman forty-five-yard line. Gilli
land ran it back to the visitors' thirty
seven-yard line, the Babes messed a pass,
the Selma line held for two more downs
and Cuddeback booted to the Selma ten
yard line. They punted right back to the
middle of the field and Dennis recovered
a fumble on his own forty-five-yard line.
Despite slippery hands and ball, Dennis
completed a pass to Howard for thirty
yards and the freshmen continued their
advance down the field, until the prep
line stiffened on their fifteen-yard line
and held the yearlings for downs.
Then followed an exchange of punts
and Selma had the ball on its own twen
ty-yard line. The freshmen blocked a
punt, Selma recovered the ball on the
twenty-yard line, fumbled in the next
play and, although the prep men re
covered again, the freshmen pushed them
back of the goal posts for a touchdown.
In the first few minutes of the fourth
quarter, with the second exchange of
punts, Gilliland took Selma's kick on his
own ten-yard line and advanced to the
middle of the field. From here the Babe
offensive started which ended with a
touchdown, Gilliland carrying over and
Dennis kicking the goal. Just before this
advance Wheat went in for Dennis at
quarter, Dennis replacing Howard at
left half, and the new field general proved
his ability to carry the ball. Shipke and
Dole gave good accounts of themselves
in taking the ball for several gains each.
With but a few minutes left before
the final gun the freshmen started an
offensive from the Selma thirty-eight
yard line which gave them the final seven
points. Wittenberg replaced Gilliland
and made three straight gains which
took the ball ahead seventeen yards.
Shipke made a good gain during the
advance and then carried over for the
touchdown. Dennis kicked the goal.
McCrorie kicked off, Selma ran it back
to the thirty-three-yard line, Corey re
placed Dennis, and the game was over.
