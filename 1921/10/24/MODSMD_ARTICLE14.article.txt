on the local field Saturday afternoon.
Gilliland and Shipke carried off the
starring honors of the day with Cudde
back, Howard and Dennis breaking
about even for second. Dodson, the
heavy-charging half of the prep squad,
was the only visitor deserving especial
mention in the records.
Cuddeback opened the game with a
boot to Selma's twenty-yard line and
the prep men were held flat in their
tracks. They had to kick and the first
Babe offensive started from the visitors'
thirty-five-yard line. Cuddeback started
the advance and it was a steady march
with Gilliland making the long gains.

around for twelve yards, Gilliland took
it three more, and Cuddeback carried
