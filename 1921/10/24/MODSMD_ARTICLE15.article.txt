# Mammoth Scoreboard To Be Built at Stadium
## 
### 
A mammoth scoreboard, forty-five
feet long and twenty-four feet in width,
requiring the attention of seven men to
operate, will be constructed at the east
end of the stadium for the information
of the 60,000 people who will view the
Big Game. Every detail of the game,
play by play, will be registered on the
board, speedily and accurately. The
play, the player's numbers, bis po
sition, the total score, the yardarge
gained, penalties inflicted; such infor
mation as is not available to the fans
in the bleachers will thus be made clear,
and the game made easier to understand.
