# The
						First Defeat
## 
### 
Stanford's football varsity emerged from Satur
day's game with the first defeat of the season on its
record. That it was the victim of a string of mis
fortunes culminating in a rainstorm that wet both
the field and players and dampened the ardor of the
onlookers is admitted. Likewise is it generally rec
ognized that the Pacific Fleet eleven was the best
that Stanford has encountered this season. It, too.
was forced to perform on a wet field. It is not the
habit of a Stanford man or team to alibi. The Pa
cific Fleet was victorious because it had the best
team on the field last Saturday.
But out of the game comes cause for rejoicing
for Stanford. It showed that despite the fact that
injuries had kept several valuable men out of the
''i.e eleven could go out and play real foot
r the most trying of conditions. So good
aying that Coach Bill Ingram of the Pacfic
I'leet said after the contest that San ford can whip
the Gold and Blue. Maybe Bill was feeling a little
jovial after his own successes on the field during
the contest. Perhaps he wanted to pay a polite com
pliment to his hosts. Whatever the motive his
meaning was very plain. He meant that Stanford
has a fighting aggregation of football men. More
than an aggregation, Stanford has a team. By a
team is not meant eleven men in moleskins, but a
machine that is smooth-running and coordinated cog
with cog. Stanford was beaten Saturday because it
encountered a greater machine when all of its.coor
dinating parts were not functioning.
Coach Gene Van Gent will exhibit the Stanford
football machine for the first time on next Saturday.
If his plans can be worked out successfully he will
have the real Stanford Varsity on the field to meet
the Oregon Agricultural College eleven.
If his patched-up team caused Big Bill Ingram,
probably the best football player 011 the Pacific Coast,
to make such a reckless prediction, what will it
do to Oregon's Fighting Aggies, the strongest foot
ball team in the Pacific Northwest?
