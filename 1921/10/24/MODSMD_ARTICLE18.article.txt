# Fight, Stanford, Fight!

### 
Have you ever engaged in a fist fight, knowing
that you were losing? Your adversary has you
nearly out, and you are gathering all that is left
in you to put into the final punch that will save you
from defeat. A friend who is watching unthink
ingly cries to you, "Hold him off!" expressing a
doubt in your ability to do so. Doesn't your re
serve sort of ooze away, and isn't your final punch
a weak sort of thing that spells your finish?
But if your friend understands what you are
trying to do and shouts, "Knock him dead!" aren't
you encouraged and don't you put more drive into
the punch that will tell ?
How do you suppose eleven men who are backed
to the'r own goal line, fighting with every ounce of
strength to ward off a touchdown by their opponents,
feci when the rooting section yells, "J fold that line !"?
That is exactly what they are trying to do, and by
voicing that phrase their supporters express doubt
in their ability to do so.
Whereas, if the entire rooting section shouti,
"Fight 'em!" there is a confidence and an encour
agement expressed which aids the team in repulsing
the attack of the opposing forces.
Let's forget the "Hold that line, Stanford!" and
remember "Fight, Stanford, Fight!" the next time
the Cardinal goal line is endangered.
