# Freshmen Athletes
## 
### 
While handing out praise to the football players
it is well to mention Coach DufTy Seay's freshman
squad. Despite the fact that the team has been
pretty definitely chosen there are still in the neigh
borhood of eighty-five men practicing every night
and furnishing competition for the first string.
This is as it should be and is in keeping with Stan
ford's traditional system of training athletes. Rec
ords of star athletes of the past show that for the
most part they developed after coming to Stanford.

In preparatory schools they were no more than or
dinary.
It is the man who stays out for a sport during
every quarter of his freshman year who becomes the
valuable athlete during the last three years of his
university life.
