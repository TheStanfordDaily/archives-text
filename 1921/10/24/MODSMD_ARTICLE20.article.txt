S. G. Trimble, Thursday Section Boss.
Ev. Ree Buddy, Friday, and Others.
In the line with Gastoria Society's recent football
quizzes, we respectfully submit a few questions below,
for the sport sharks to answer.
# * *
If you think you are intelligent, don't try these.
* * *
Do you know: —To what Indian tribe does an off
tackle buck belong?
2. What is the relation of the umpire to the referee?
If second cousin, say so. If brother, keep it quiet.
3. Have you ever seen a tandem play? What does it
play? Does it keep tune?
4. Do you know the penalty for crawling? Camel
walking? Shimmying?
5. Is a lateral pass good on the Kampus Karline?
Who said so?
♦ * *
We have secured, at great expense, several of the
world's most notorious speakers to address the campus
every other Blue Monday, as we believe there are not
enough lectures going on now.
* * *
All those in favor stand up. Bandmaster, please play
the "Star Spangled Banner."
* * *
Here are some of the headliners. Watch for the
dates.
* * *
Roy Gardner will deliver a special address on "My
Work With the Pen." Of special interest to the demon
reporters.
« * #
Annie Laurie, of the S. F. Examination (Hearst), will
address a select few on the "Evils of the Dope Traffic
in San Francisco." Admittance will be by card only.
See Chief Kabbage Gatherer for further details.
* * *
Prof. Einstein will explain why his theory of rela
tivity is not clear. This will be under the auspices of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Every
thing. No minors (or engineers either) admitted.
* * *
But this will not be all. The Cabbage Society has
succeedede in arranging an all-star musicale. A riot
of fun! Galaxy of shooting stars!! It's a kick!!! (as
(hey say in Australia).
* * *•
Here is the program:
ALL BY MYSELF —Go!o by Brick Morcc (tenor).
DO YOU EVER THINK OF ME—Rendered by Vol
stead & Co. (base). A knockout.
I NEVER KNEW—Dirge by Andy Smith (presby
terian). To be sung on evening of Nov. 19.
NAJO—Japanese All-Star Trio (saxophone, comb,
and washing machinc). In two verses, chorus,
patter and half-hitch.
* * *
The following melodius "bit of Shakesperian poetry
was sent to us by Bushman Bill, whose native home is
Palo Alto. After a conference with the faculty we de
cided to print it:
The Co-Ed's Prayer
The following melodious bit of Shakespearian poetry
I want the man, I want the (soda-pop),
I want the things without the price—
I want to be naughty and yet to bo nice.
I want the thrill of a long-held kiss,
I want the things that good girls miss;
1 want the arms and heart of a man—
But I want to stay single as long as I can!
What I really want is some good advice.
On how to be naughty and yet be nice.
* ♦ *
Since the game with the Pacific Fleet Saturday, at
least ten of the 500 have written in to the Colyum to
find out if Bill Ingram is married or single. We didn't
Get a chance to ask him, but he seemed to have a happy
look on his faco most of the time, so you can judge
for yourself.

However, this is decidedly not a matrimonial column.
Questions relating to the proper rare of canaries, the
latest price of Associated Sardine Stock, and the Great
War, will be cheerfully answered; but. there are some
things even a Cabbage editor —even the Tuesday and
Wednesday ones—can not answer.
* * *
WAR—is hereby declared on the guy who turns up
the spout of our faucet without warning.

Pull Up the Covers
Tap. Tap. Tap. Hark! Hush. Heavens! There it
goes again. Tap, Tap, etc. With caccliinating knees,
we creep to the door. Silence. Thoughts of Poe. What
is that? A low, yet penetrating, growl. Chills playing
tag and Chopin on our spinal chord. We open the door
and tiptoe out. CLANK! The lock snaps.
A weird light is cast on the long hall by the in
candescent at the far end. Suddenly we feel a Pres
ence. Sniff! E-e-eek!! SLAM!!! But the lock holds.
Desperate, we turn to face (he monster—
He sits regarding us curiously. His nether appendage
waves slowly. Encina's unmanicured bulldog has a
habit of roaming the halls at night.

Shakespeare or Bacon or somebody said that prophets
are never without honor, except in their own country.
Before going any furthpr with this, we wish to state
that the honor system should be extended to prophecy.
It was not without long and careful consideration, in
volving undue retiocination on our part, that —well, here
goes. Rugby will come back. Announcement comes
out that (ho team will tour the British Isles, known ns
the place where student body cards will admit to any
bar. This ought to bring out at least 1999 applicants.
