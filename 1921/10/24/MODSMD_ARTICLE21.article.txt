# WELFARE WORK FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS TO COMMENCE SOON
## 
### 
Plans are now under development
for a European students' relief drive,
to take place during the early part
.of November. Dr. Charles Marx of
the engineering department, last Tues
day evening, called into conference
Dan Evans, student body president,
Kathryn Donald, president of lioble
Club, Mary Mathews, of the Associ
ated Women, Edna Wilbur and Fred
Shipke, presidents of Y. W. C. A. and
Y. M. C. A, respectively, suggesting
to them the need of such a drive.
Dr. Diesendorf, formerly connected
with the Y. M. C. A. of the University
of California, and recently returned
from Europe, where he made a study
of conditions, spoke to those present
lon the necessity of American aid.
Though he went abroad somewhat
skeptical of the students' position, Dr.
Diesendorf was urgent in his appeal
to Stanford.
It has always been contrary to tra
dition for students to work, but as
a result of the war those traditions
are breaking down. The students
themselves, are fitting up barracks for
dormitories.
According to Dr. Diesendorf, the ma
jority of people in the devastated
countries regard this post war period
as a sort of truce in which they must
build up industry and solve the prob
lem of a decreased birth rate prepara
tory to the next war. Since it is only
through some outside force that this
viewpoint can be changed, the hope
of the world lies in the student and
his right outlook. England impresses
one as willing to forget the war and
its animosities. The United States
must have the same attitude of sports
manship, says Dr. Diesendorf, con
sidering neither race, creed or nation
ality.
Prof. H. R. Fairclough is devoting
his services to the cause as chairman
of the campaign.
