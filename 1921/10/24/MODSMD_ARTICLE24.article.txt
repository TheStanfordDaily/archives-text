# FEW SURPRISES IN OPENING PLAY OF HANDBALL TOURNEY
## 
### 
Favorites in both the singles and
doubles handball tournaments came
through the first round play entirely un
scathed. The preliminary matches were
nearly all played off by last Saturday
and this week the process of elimination
will continue.
The contest, which was looked to by
handball followers to provide the ma
jority of thrills, was between Rutter and
Reticker, representing Delta Chi, and
Maier and Mulryan, off-campus. The
affair proved to be rather a walk-away
for the Delta Chi pair who dealt out the
losers' end to Mair and Mulryan in two
straight games. The closest play of the
week was staged by Cohen and San
sone, who were opposed by Fehrer and
Badham. After losing the first game,
Fehrer and Badham annexed the deci
sion in the next, only to lose to their
more experienced rivals in the rubber.
In the singles tournament there was
less in the way of excitement, most of
the matches being decided in two games.
Sansone, Rutter, Reticker, Maier, Young
and M. Cohen look to be the ones that
will be in the final tight for the singles
championship.
The results of the week's play follow:
Doubles—Sansone and M. Cohen defeat
ed Fehrer and Badham; Rutter and Re
ticker defeated Maier and Mulryan;
Landweer and Sidway defeated Duncan
and Miliken; Preston* and Brazil de
feated Allen and Webster.
Singles—Sansone defeated Sidway,
Ferry defeated E. Connolly, Rutter de

len, W. Young defeated Schwartz, Wohl
