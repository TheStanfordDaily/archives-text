# BABE SOCCER SQUAD LOSES TO BEAR CUBS
## 
### 
Saturday morning the Cardinal 1925
soccer aggregation went down to a
4 to 0 defeat, at the hands of the
California Babes in the first practice
game of the season. The freshmen
journeyed to Berkeley expecting to
play a practice game with the Cali
fornia varsity. This game, however,
was called off, duo to the fact that
California will not let any varsity com
pete with freshman teams.
In order that the Stanford players
should not go homo without a game,
the California frest.men consented to
play in their varsity's place. For the
first half of the game, the Stanford
freshmen held the young Bruins to a
single goal. In the next half, bow
ever, the Stanford defense weakened
and allowed three scores.
Coach Maloney's freshmen who
went up to Berkeley were: Captain
Baugh, Carey, Hall, Rodriguez, Quig
ley, Hoover, Off, Cannon, Turquand,
Meza and Hays.
