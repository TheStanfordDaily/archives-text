sonal freedom and privileges to the
students; and
Whereas, no other system is con
sistent with the high standards of
moral resposibilities and individual
integrity with the legal profession
enjoins, or is in keeping with the
spirit of Stanford men and women;
and
Whereas, the Honor System depends
for its efficacy upon its perpetuation
with unabated traditionary force to
successive classes of the Law School;
Be It Resolved; That the members
of this Association declare their firm
adherence to the Honor System and
affirm their purpose to be governed
thereby in relation to the require
ments of the Law School;
That each member will individually
refrain from any conduct whatever,
violating or tending to violate the
Honor System in letter or in spirit,
' and will avoid any conduct abusing
; the privileges by it secured.
That each and every member will,
whenever occasion shall arise, assume
and exedcise individual responsibili
ty to caution against or otherwise ex
press disapproval of any such conduct
on the part of another."
