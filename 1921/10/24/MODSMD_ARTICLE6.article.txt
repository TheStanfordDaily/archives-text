# SOCCER VARSITY WINS FAST GAME
## Barbarians Humbled on Local Turf by 3-2 Count; Gorman, Half, is Cardinal Star 
### 
By defeating the Barbarians 3-2 in an
airtight game Saturday afternoon, the
Stanford soccer varsity still maintains
the lead in the University and Club Soc
cer League. Despite the rain, the game
was an unusually fast one.
Stanford undoubtedly had the fastest
team in the field, but the opposition
overcame this with smooth and easy
team work. At times the varsity dis
played some of the team work that
they fiave been showing during the
past week, but as a rule the bulk of
the work fell on a few men. On the
other hand, the San Francisco players
kept to their places, and when the ball
was passed they were there to meet it.
This sort of play imperiled the Card
inal goal more than once, but good head
ing and kicking of the ball on the part
of the backfield kept the visitors from
scoring.
Captain Bill Gorman for the Cardinals
was undoubtedly the star of the game.
His speed and charging of the ball
broke up more than one of the machine
like attacks of the Barbarian line. As
an offensive player, Gorman is in a
class by himself, as he constantly rushes
the ball, and with his accurate kick boots
it to his forwards. As a team mate and
brother half, Swain is Gorman's greatest
aid. This is Swain's first year on the
varsity and from all appearances it
looks as though he will be one of Coach
Maloney's reliables.
Peavy and Deffenbach were the for
wards who did the scoring work of the
Cardinals. • These two men play inside
right and inside left, respectively. They
are always rushing the goal, and it was
only with the greatest effort that the
Barb backfield held them as well as they
did. Mead did good work at the out
side right position.
The Barbarians showed up as a team
rather than as individuals. For the most
part these men arc veteran players in
the old country, and their knowledge of
the game was easily seen.
The Barbarians kicked to the Cardinal
backfield. Swain returned the ball to
Peavy, who with good team work on
the part of the rest of the forwards
came within an ace of scoring. Thomp
son for the Barbs returned the ball to
center field, the Cardinals failing to
score. For the next ten minutes the var
sity had the ball in opposing territory,
and it looked as though the game would
he a walkaway for Stanford. The for
wards, however, suddenly lost their be
ginning fire, and the Barbarians with a
wav£ of superiority took the ba!l down
the field for the first score of the game.
Stanford was then placed on the de
fensive. Mehdonca. however, mads a
long, clean boot to Sanders, who made
a pcrfect center to Deffenbach. Dcf
fenbach dribbled around the opposing
fullback and kicked a goal, thereby
tieing the score. The half ended with
the ball on Stanford's territory.
In the second half Stanford dis
played poor team work and the Bar
barians had little difficulty in scoring
again. Peavy, however, took advantage
of an opportunity and headed in a long
shot from Gorman, thereby tieing the
score again. A minute later Peavy again
scored from a difficult angle from a
dribbled ball from Swain. The game
ended with the Cardinals pressing the
Barbarian goal. Score: Stanford 3,
Barbarians 2.
