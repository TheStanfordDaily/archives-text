# PACIFIC FLEET DOWNS VARSITY ON WET FIELD
## "Big Bill" Ingram Shows Why He Is All-American as Cardinal Bows To Heavy Navy Eleven, 27 to 7 
### E. C. West. '23 
Braving a heavy rainstorm, 5000 peo
ple Saturday saw what an Ail-American
football player could do.
The Pacific Fleet beat Stanford 27-7.
Gene Van Gent's Cardinals scored in
the last few minutes of play just as the
sun, blinking momentarily from behind
black clouds, had cast a faint red tinge
in the far west. Sinister-like the skies
had been black earlier in the afternoon
as a lighter, faster Stanford team tried
to hold a heavier, more experienced foe
on a wet and slippery field where the
heavier and more experienced team
holds a two to one advantage.
And "Big Bill" Ingram, as scowling
and as menacing as the afternoon, took
advantage of his advantage.
"Big Bill" Ingram, hero of famous
grid battles during his career at Annapo
lis, showed why he was an All-Ameri
can.
He beat Stanford 27 to 7.
It was Ingram who made the neces
sary yards when the navy team needed
them, who ran seventy yards for a
touchdown, who did the passing, the
kicking and half of the tackling for
the Pacific Fleet. No wonder Stanford
lost.
Stanford's fast backs could not get
started until the last few minutes of
play.
But in those last few minutes, a beaten
team showed an offensive that hinted
at what might have happened had the
day been warm and the field dry.
Taking the ball on its own twenty
five yard mark where the crafty In
gram had kicked to touch, Stanford
drove relentlessly seventy-five yards to
a touchdown.
Sixty of of those seventy-five yards
were made either on forward passes or
end runs. Bob Shlaudeman, who had
brought the ball to the Fleet's three
yard line on a twisting, squirming run
of twenty yards, bucked it over.
Shlaudeman stood out as the Stanford
star. With him were Art Wilcox, who
played perfect football, and Fred Ludeke
in the line, a hugh fellow with a high
pitched voice that kept saying "they
can't do it."
The Pacific Fleet scored in the first
five minutes of plav.
Ludeke's kickoff was short, Rcifel
catching the ball and bringing it in to
the navy forty-yard line. On the first
play, Ingram, behind perfect interfer
ence, ran thirty yards before he was
dropped. Steady drives through the
Cardinal line brought the ball to the

one-yard line where Waters carried it
over. Ingram kicked goal.
A blocked forward pass that fell into
Von Heimberg's hands gave the fleet
team a second opportunity to score
soon after. The Stanford line held,
however, and Ingram missed a try from
placement.
Early in the second period the navy
drove down to Stanford's thirty-yard
line where they lost the hall on downs.
On the hrst play, Wilcox fumbled and
the fleet recovered. A steady drive put
the ball over for a second touchdown,
Struckus scoring. Ingram missed the try
for goal.
Stanford showed her first offensive
of the afternoon at the close of the half
but time came too soon. After a couple
of short line plunges, Wilcox circled end
for twenty yards. Two forward passes.
Woodward to Shlaudeman and to Pat
rick netted sixteen yards and the ball was
less than thirty yards from the fleet's
goal line. The half ended here.
A determined fleet offensive early in
the third quarter, during which Struckus
contributed twenty yards on a dash
around end, resulted in the third score
of the afternoon. Waters carried the
ball over the line and Ingram kicked
goal.
The last score for the Pacific Fleet
came when Ingram raced seventy yards
through the entire Stanford team for a
touchdown. He kicked goal.
Stanford's score came in the last few
minutes of the fourth period.
A twenty-five yard pass, Shlaudeman
to Wilcox, started things. Patrick
smashed into the fleet line for five yards
and Shlaudeman found another hole for
first and ten. Shlaudeman passed again
to Wilcox who made fifteen yards be
fore he was spilled. Patrick made three
yards through the line and Shlaudeman
circled end for twenty yards. This put
the bail on the lleet's three-yard mark.
Patrick made two of it on a split buck
and Shlaudeman pushed it over center.
Wilcox kicked goal.
The game ended two minutes later.
