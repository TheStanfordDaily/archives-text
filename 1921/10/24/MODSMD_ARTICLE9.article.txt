# Paraders to Demonstrate What the Man Will Wear
## 
### 
The Encina Pajamarino Pee-rade,
which had its origin in 1892 when
202 Encina Hall men, in evening dress,
met the varsity baseball team at
Menlo, after Stanford's first victory
over the University of California, will
take place tomorrow night.
The traditional apples are to be
passed out at the Delta Upsilon house.
In addition, the A. T. O. mansion will
be visited, and every parader supplied
with fruit.
