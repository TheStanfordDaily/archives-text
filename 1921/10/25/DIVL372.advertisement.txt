of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators
The WOOLWORTH TOWER — the tallest
office building; the Equitable — the largest; the
Singer Building—in fact most of the buildings
that make up the best known sky line in the
world, are equipped with Otis Elevators.
Few people realize the amount of wealth of
Manhattan Island that is due to the creation
and development of modern vertical transporta
tion by the Otis Elevator Company. New York
City could not grow wider hemmed in as it
was by the two rivers and the bay. It had to
grow skyward.
And now, the Otis Elevators in New York City
carry daily more than twice the number of pas
sengers carried by all the traction lines of New
York —subway, surface, elevated and railroads.
Nothing short of a book would adequately tell
the story of Otis in New York alone.

RAIL WA Y CRISIS!
What Would an Advertising
Crisis Mean?
While the foremost minds of the Nation are centered in solvit
a most threatening war between stubborn labor and equally obstina
railway owners, the writer's thoughts drifted into what might resi
in almost as serious a catastrophe—what if all the ADVERTISIT
FORCES would go on strike?
Could you imagine this country devoid of all advertising?
If this stabilizing force was menaced there would be a virtual
war over PRICE every time we bought a cigar, a meal, a suit of
clothes, a package of chewing gum, or an automobile.
There would be no way of establishing styles and fashions. The
shoes, the clothes, and the hats we wear would lack all that we look
for in them—style and quality.
We would need to take valuable time by personally investigating
where was to be found the best show, where good suits could be
bought, where to go to have a good time, where to go to eat and
sleep in a strange city, where . . . indeed, every effort that advertising
now minimizes would be lost. We would be robbed of valuable time
the most precious thing in the world.
Advertising enables us to publish the Daily Palo Alto and send
to some 2700 readers a message every day that helps to unify the
various phases of University life.
Great indeed is the force of
advertising !
Encourage merchants to advertise in The Daily Palo Alto by
mentioning the fact that there you saw their ad.
This is the third of a series of ads on

of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators
The WOOLWORTH TOWER — the tallest
office building; the Equitable — the largest; the
Singer Building—in fact most of the buildings
that make up the best known sky line in the
world, are equipped with Otis Elevators.
Few people realize the amount of wealth of
Manhattan Island that is due to the creation
and development of modern vertical transporta
tion by the Otis Elevator Company. New York
City could not grow wider hemmed in as it
was by the two rivers and the bay. It had to
grow skyward.
And now, the Otis Elevators in New York City
carry daily more than twice the number of pas
sengers carried by all the traction lines of New
York —subway, surface, elevated and railroads.
Nothing short of a book would adequately tell
the story of Otis in New York alone.

RAIL WA Y CRISIS!
What Would an Advertising
Crisis Mean?
While the foremost minds of the Nation are centered in solvit
a most threatening war between stubborn labor and equally obstina
railway owners, the writer's thoughts drifted into what might resi
in almost as serious a catastrophe—what if all the ADVERTISIT
FORCES would go on strike?
Could you imagine this country devoid of all advertising?
If this stabilizing force was menaced there would be a virtual
war over PRICE every time we bought a cigar, a meal, a suit of
clothes, a package of chewing gum, or an automobile.
There would be no way of establishing styles and fashions. The
shoes, the clothes, and the hats we wear would lack all that we look
for in them—style and quality.
We would need to take valuable time by personally investigating
where was to be found the best show, where good suits could be
bought, where to go to have a good time, where to go to eat and
sleep in a strange city, where . . . indeed, every effort that advertising
now minimizes would be lost. We would be robbed of valuable time
the most precious thing in the world.
Advertising enables us to publish the Daily Palo Alto and send
to some 2700 readers a message every day that helps to unify the
various phases of University life.
Great indeed is the force of
advertising !
Encourage merchants to advertise in The Daily Palo Alto by
mentioning the fact that there you saw their ad.
This is the third of a series of ads on
the value of Daily Palo Alto advertising.
