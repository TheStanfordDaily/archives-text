# OREGON AGGIES TO MEET CARDS HERE SATURDAY
## Dopesters Still Talking Over "Big Bill" Ingram and His Wicked Pacific Fleet Team 
### 
That the Pacific Fleet team is about
the best outfit that will appear on the
Stanford turf this season, was the gen
eral opinion expressed on the campus
today.
The navy aggregation had everything
that a good football team should haveâ€”
weight, speed and experience, and they
used it in a splendid offense and de
fense. On top of that they had Ingram,
one of the best grid players in the
United States today.
There can be no criticism of the play
of the Cardinal eleven. They were out
classed on the wet field that hindered
the style of fast, open play on which
Van Gent and the other mentors had
figured to beat the Fleet. Considering
the condition of the field there were few
fumbles. The heavier team had the ad
vantage and the breaks surely went that
way.
No less a person than "Big Bill" In
gram himself is reputed to have made
the statement after the game that Stan
ford would give the California Bruins
a hunt when the teams tangle in the
Stanford stadium on November 19. In
gram said that the Cards looked good
to him.
There may be something in his asser
tions at that. Figures do not lie and
figures show that the Pacific Fleet made
twenty-one downs against Andy Smith's
team. They made seventeen against
Stanford Saturday.
Van Gent sent his charges through a
hard workout last night but there was
no scrimmage as far as the first var
sity was concerned. The team under
went an hour and a half of signal drill,
using several new formations.
The Cards will get their share of work
this week with the first conference game
of the season just five days ahead. The
Oregon Aggies will appear here Satur
day, and if all reports from the north
are true, it should be a mean fray.
The Aggies are easily the strongest
team in the northwest save possibly
Washington State College. They won
their first conference affair of the year
Saturday when they trimmed the Uni
versity of Washington at Corvallis,
24 to 0.
"Scotchy" Campbell is the only Card
inal player out with injuries. Ray
Doughty and Harley Carter were both
out in suit last night and Carter ran
signals at his old place at right tackle.
DeGroot was at center, Betts and Fa
ville at guards, Ludeke at the other
tackle and Mertz, Sproull and Pershing
alternated at the ends. Woodward called
signals with Wilcox and Shlaudeman at
halfs and Patrick at full.
