# LACROSSE IS NEW SPORT HERE: GAME RESEMBLES SOCCER
## 
### 
Lacrosse and Stanford are new friends
and because of tliis many students are
at loss when the game is mentioned. It
is one of the chief Canadian sports and
was brought to the University by one of
our northern .students. Following is a
brief discription of the game:
The game was originally taken from
the Indians and was, in fact, their form
of baseball and football combined. The
pfesent form is somewhat modified from
that first used by the Indians but it still
retains many characteristics of both our
football and baseball sports.
Lacrosse, as played today, has twelve
men on each side. The two teams com
pete on a field the size of a football field.
At each end of the field there are two
goals fashioned somewhat like those
used in soccer. The object of the game
is to place the lacrosse ball between
these goal posts.
The lacrosse ball is similar to a base
ball hut a little smaller. Sticks are used
to propel this ball up and down the field.
A shinny stick with the hook lengthened
out and the cu,rve cris-crosscd with
rawhide netting to form a pocket would
perhaps describe the lacrosse stick best.
These sticks arc used something in
the manner of a tennis racket to hurl
the ball up and down the field. Lacrosse
players in action remind one of a soc
cer team, the only great difference be
ing that the former use a stick to pro
pel the ball while the latter use their
feet.
Anyone who has successfully played
baseball should succeed at lacrosse be
cause of his ability to judge distance
and to throw and catch a ball accurately.
A complete set of lacrosse sticks and
equipment for two teams has been se
cured. It is the wish of the manager,
Mr. Grosseman, to develop a real team
this year. Any one who is interested in
the game should see him at once or
make further inquiries at the gym.
