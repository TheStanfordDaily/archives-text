# HOUSE BURNS DOWN— ALMOST; SWALLOW'S NEST SAVED—ALMOST
##

Smoke! Do you like smoke? If so,
you missed it by not being at the S.
A. E. house this morning.
For the almond-eyed culinary artist
at that establishment, sensing the
chill of early Autumn in the atmos
phere, decided to concoct a little heat,
and accordingly advanced upon the
long dormant furnace in the nether
regions of the house.
Shovel after shovelful of $17.00 a
ton coal the triumphant Oriental
tossed into the gaping mouth of the
"heat-maker." How could he know
that four generations of itinerant swal
lows had domiciled in that chimney
top since the last time smoke so peace
fully floated out its open top, and had
deposited sufficient nest material there
to form an effective barrage against
all comers —smoke included!
Suddenly, wliisps of stygian black
ness began to ooze through the fur
nace door, and soon this increased in
volume, until clouds of Hades' black
est, dirtiest smoke poured forth upon
the bewildered son of the Rising Sun.
Black, black smoke rolled out of the
doors and windows; bored co-eds
paused to watch the house burn down;
it was a moment of great suspense.
But the hungry flames, with a supreme
effort, pierced the four generations of
swallows' nests; the smoke dashed
madly up this new avenue of escape;
and the house was saved.
Now the S. A. E. cook has joined
the Anti-Smoke League.
