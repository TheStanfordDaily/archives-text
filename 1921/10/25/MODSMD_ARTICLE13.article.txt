# FRESHMEN TO PLAY COLLEGE OF PACIFIC
## 
### 
"Swede" Righter's cohorts, the Col
lege of the Pacific team, are scheduled
to face the freshmen on the local turf
Saturday at 1:30, as a preliminary to
the Stanford-Oregon Aggie game. Al
though it is early in the week to dope
out the lineup that will face the Pa
cific team, it will probably be the same
as the one that administered the 23-0
defeat to Selma last week, with the ex
ception of Hays, whose place at center
will be tilled by Moplofsky.
Van Hook is, at present, on the in
jured list with a bad leg, and is out of
the Saturday contest, as are YVideman,
who has an arm in a sling, and Kim
netzer, who tore a ligament in his
shoulder.
Cuddeback is almost sure of starting
at his old position at full, with Mc-
Crorie ready to fill his place in case he
should be needed. Howard and Gilli
land are the best for the backs, but
Wittenburg and Corey are playing good
ball, and the fans are fairly sure of see
ing ' them in action Saturday. Dennis
will call signals for the first-year team.
Janssen and Dickey are the best bets for
the end positions, with Sliipke and Dole
as their running mates at tackle. Guard
positions look sure to go to Crook and
Neill.
Gilliland has developed an excellent
swerving run in running back punts, and
is good for a great deal of yardage. He
would undoubtedly have made more
yardage on plays from open formation
in the Selma game, but was seldom
called upon to carry the ball.
