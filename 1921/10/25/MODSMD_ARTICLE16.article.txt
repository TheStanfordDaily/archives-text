# IRISH QUESTION IS OUTLINED BY FRANCIS W. HIRST
## New Light Thrown on Sinn Fein Movement in Historial Review of the Irish 
### 
"To understand the Irish problem one
must realize the sentimental importance
of Irish history," declared Professor
Francis W. Hirst in his lecture on the
"Irish Problem" yesterday afternoon in
the Little Theater.
The first Sinn Fein movement had
only a literary purpose, teaching the
Celtic language to a people who had
forgotten it during the last century. To
day the four elements of the problem are
language, religion, differences in tastes
and the character of the people them
selves. From the time of Elizabeth un
til today the claims of Ireland have been
associated with the idea that home rule
means "Rome rule."
Professor Hirst has divided his sub
ject into two sections, having spoken
Monday on the historial aspect, and re
serving for the Friday lecture modern
phases of the situation.
Though it is doubtful whether or not
Roman conquerors ever visited Ireland,
it is certain that commerce was carried
on between the two peoples, and there
are many traces of Roman habits and
customs. It was St. Patrick who, as a
Romanized Scot, converted Ireland to
Christianity.
When the Norsemen and Danes swept
down fro mthe north Ireland was rav
aged and plundered. The country was
civilized, it is true, but while other lands
were advancing 'Ireland was in a state
of deterioration from the continued
fighting.
During the Anglo-Norman interven
tion of 1168, Ireland first recognized the
kings of England. It was during the Re
formation and the controversy of Queen
Elizabeth with Philip of Spain that the
struggle between Ireland and England
was begun which has not yet ended.
Under James I of England colonization
of Ulster began—the Ulster that is to
day so difficult to manage.
"From the time of. the Gunpowder
Plot and the Spanish Armada to my own
boyhood days, the church of Rome and
Ireland have been regarded as danger
ous. If too powerful it was felt that
they would introduce despotism and su
perstition into the home government,"
Professor Hirst said, in speaking of the
power of the church in the state. Lord
Moreley feels that a reduction of Cath
olic priests in Ireland will result from
home rule.
Bishops sent out from the Church of
England about the time of Cromwell
were often of questionable character.
The story goes that these ecclesiastics
were not always of bad repute. On
their way to London one day they were
murdered by highwaymen who, appro
priating the bishops' garments, resumed
their journey to London.
It was unforttinate for Ireland that
Irish patriots joined the French Revo
lutionist forces, for with the Revolu
tionist victories, flames of Irish nation
alism were revived.
The nineteenth century period was one
of over population and poverty, for with
110 coal the country could not share in
the industries developed in England.
Traveling through Ireland today one
sees comparative prosperity. Stone cot
tages have replaced old hovels, and
there has been a division of large es
tates, under the Homestead Act, into
tracts of thirty or forty acres, sufficient
to support a family.
Today it would take a bold man to
question the intellectual ability of the
Irish as a nation, and, according to
Professor Hirst, they are not incapable
of self-government.

The first Sinn Fein movement had
only a literary purpose, teaching the
Celtic language to a people who had
forgotten it during the last century. To
day the four elements of the problem are
language, religion, differences in tastes
and the character of the people them
selves. From the time of Elizabeth un
til today the claims of Ireland have been
associated with the idea that home rule
means "Rome rule."
Professor Hirst has divided his sub
ject into two sections, having spoken
Monday on the historial aspect, and re
serving for the Friday lecture modern
phases of the situation.
Though it is doubtful whether or not
Roman conquerors ever visited Ireland,
it is certain that commerce was carried
on between the two peoples, and there
are many traces of Roman habits and
customs. It was St. Patrick who, as a
Romanized Scot, converted Ireland to
Christianity.
When the Norsemen and Danes swept
down fro mthe north Ireland was rav
aged and plundered. The country was
civilized, it is true, but while other lands
were advancing 'Ireland was in a state
of deterioration from the continued
fighting.
During the Anglo-Norman interven
tion of 1168, Ireland first recognized the
kings of England. It was during the Re
formation and the controversy of Queen
Elizabeth with Philip of Spain that the
struggle between Ireland and England
was begun which has not yet ended.
Under James I of England colonization
of Ulster began—the Ulster that is to
day so difficult to manage.
"From the time of. the Gunpowder
Plot and the Spanish Armada to my own
boyhood days, the church of Rome and
Ireland have been regarded as danger
ous. If too powerful it was felt that
they would introduce despotism and su
perstition into the home government,"
Professor Hirst said, in speaking of the
power of the church in the state. Lord
Moreley feels that a reduction of Cath
olic priests in Ireland will result from
home rule.
Bishops sent out from the Church of
England about the time of Cromwell
were often of questionable character.
The story goes that these ecclesiastics
were not always of bad repute. On
their way to London one day they were
murdered by highwaymen who, appro
priating the bishops' garments, resumed
their journey to London.
It was unforttinate for Ireland that
Irish patriots joined the French Revo
lutionist forces, for with the Revolu
tionist victories, flames of Irish nation
alism were revived.
The nineteenth century period was one
of over population and poverty, for with
110 coal the country could not share in
the industries developed in England.
Traveling through Ireland today one
sees comparative prosperity. Stone cot
tages have replaced old hovels, and
there has been a division of large es
tates, under the Homestead Act, into
tracts of thirty or forty acres, sufficient
to support a family.
Today it would take a bold man to
question the intellectual ability of the
Irish as a nation, and, according to
Professor Hirst, they are not incapable
of self-government.
"To understand the Irish problem one
must realize the sentimental importance
of Irish history," declared Professor
Francis W. Hirst in his lecture on the
"Irish Problem" yesterday afternoon in
the Little Theater.
