# The
						Women's Perspective.
## 
### 
Never before, according to evidence on all sides,
has Stanford's future been so bright or held such
promise along all lines of activity and endeavor.
Before us is a year which is tilled with opportunity
for ambition and attainment.
Never before have so many factors contributed at
one time toward the progress of the University.
The present convergence of building enterprises, op
timistic athletic prospects and even a happy aca
demic outlook, marks a degree of prosperity and
general well-being heretofore impossible of realiza
tion. And there is the enthusiasm to carry it
through, it is unanimously conceded that Stan
ford's "Big Year" is before lis.
This view which applies to the future of the en
tire student body concerns also the interests of the
women of the University. In the general interest
and enthusiasm they must not allow the importance
which the present year holds for their activiteis to
become obscured. The Associated Women Stu
dents, acting as a unit, can accomplish much for
Stanford during this year of exceptional oppor
tunity. They are a small body and can therefore
work as a whole with the most desired results.
It is for each woman to realize her individual
responsibility toward making this the year all it has
started to be. Participation in activities by a few
leaders who "go in for everything" does not make
for the greatest progress in the interests of the
women students or the University at large. Now that
the first few weeks of adjustment are over, and be
fore the usual accumulation of scholastic work pre
vents, each woman should make certain she is doing
her part in the life of the University and giving
genuine interest and support to the making of this
a year of achievement, M. J. C.
