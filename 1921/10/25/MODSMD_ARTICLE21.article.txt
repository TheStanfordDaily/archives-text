ANNA CONDA
Perpetration second by
S. N. Ache, and B. Lee Ache
Scene one. (Football field. Anna Conda and Akbar
kicking ball with feet. Anna disguised as Chick Evans
from Dartmouth, in golf pants —another robbed golf.
Opposing side kicks).
Akbar: 45-10-56-2. Courage, men, courage.
Anna: Too much for a cur's age.
Akbar: Poor. You can write Friday's Cabbages.
Anna: So? If Postmaster General Hays had a little
son what do you think the boy would call him. Boil
some slaw out of that.
Akbar: Fodder, likely.
Anna: Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
What a funny guy you are.
(Punt lands. That's how fast they are.)
Scene two (Same).
Akbar: (Pantomine).
Anna: (Pantomine).
Both: (Pantomine).
Last scene: (Shower roomj.
Akbar: Don't laugh. God made me that way.
Anna: Good God!
Akbar: It's just as logic says. Some apples are not
sweet. Therefore, all sweet things are not apples.
Like to try a cigarett? Not the one last week's
contributor mentioned.
Anna: Yes?
Akbar: Don't remind me. But you do light them with
an air of sang froid for an athlete.
Anna: Good old Ak. That's not an air, that's a
match.
Akbar:
Anna: Now, isn't that clever?

October 22, 1921.
Cabbage:—Sir, my room mate at Roble says that by
the time she has a car of her own to drive, she will
be fat and maybe forty, and very likely have to walk for
reducing purposes. Is she a pessimist or a realist. —
SILICATE.
* * *
Where does she get that stuff? It's spelled S-I-L-L-Y
—K-A-T-E.
* * *
Who can say whether she is a pessimist or a realist
when the only reducing purpose so far accomplished
is the reputation of the strip. We can tell what Silicate
is, at any rate, and it's not sand that's meant.

Thanks for the "sir," dear lady. Any more so address
ed will surely be printed. Admitting the prejudice?
Look out, D. P. A. Times.

In response to a call for questions, a flock of letters
of anything but merit have been dumped off at our
door. Either they razzed the razzer or didn't razz any
thing. There are a couple of exceptions. One follows:

Question: —Why does my heart stop every time 1
see Angie's face?
Answer: —That's easy; better look at your watch and
see if it's running, next time.

In closing, the brow of the devourer will elevate,
please. Carl Sanburg will not outdo this column. The
following is poetry.

Smoke and Steal.
Smoke a reeking Hump.
Smokee a smelling Nut for less money.
Cigarette smoke, pipe smoke is not track smoke.
W. C. T. U. says
that all smokers
steal
Steal, they say, like tempted with Sticky Wilson's
clock.
Smoke sneaks like the thief in the night upon the fret
ful wind of the midnight "professional conversa
tionalist," the prowler, he sneaks windily away—
stealing sleep.
Smoke that culs in blue wreaths from fags in athletes'
mouths steals away, on the wind. . . and the wind
is lost.
Smoke steals and yet it does not steal; not second nor
even home plate so the W. C. T. U. must be full
of "professional conversation."
Smoke and wind are comrades, and
The wind dies down. . . and gives out.
There is no longer anyone to bum papers from —
There is no longer any fantasia —
Wherefore. . . smoke up, contributors,
No one will ever know where you stole the
fire. K. Iceberg.

The foregoing is literature. Let it he the last brus
sels-sprout for today.

SICK 'EM, DOCTOR!
