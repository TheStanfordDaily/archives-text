# STANFORD-U.C. WOMEN TO HAVE CLOSE MEET
## 
### 
"Stanford women now have the mak
ings of a senior team which will give
them a line chance for winning the Cali
fornia meet on November sth," said
Mrs. Ernest Bransten, coach for the
women's swimming teams, yesterday aft
ernoon. "With "Babe" Caughey, '22, for
the 100-yard and Myra Waterman, '22,
and "Peggy" Carlsmith, '22, swimming
breast stroke, the team will make a
good showing despite training since Au
gust on the part of the rival team. Doris
Stevenson will come through with a
pretty finish for the 50-yard dash. Every
practice has shown a steady gain in
time and development of form in the
case of each swimmer. There is, a pos
sibility of graduates entering, thus en
abling all-star swimmers of last year to
compete. A decision will be made soon
in regard to this.
The junior team looks promising, with
Frances Fish, '23, out daily for fancy
dive and sprint practice. Back stroke
and crawl turnouts are working up fine.
Anita Berendsen, '24, and Dorothy
Grant, '24, will probably be foremost in
upholding sophomore honors. More ma
terial and steadier practice is needed for
the '24 squad.
The freshman class has been conspicu
ous at the Roble pool for excellent
turnouts, showing keen interest on the
part of the class as a whole. The 50 and
100-yard clashes will be featured by Ma
bel McKibbin, '25, and Margaret Mar
tin, '25. Margaret Watson. '25, is work
ing up a good breast stroke that will
probably run up the points for the '25
team.
The meet will take place Saturday
morning and will begin at 9 o'clock
sharp. The underclass teams will com
pete with the California underclass
teams in all events. After these scores
are taken the upperclass squads will meet
junior and senior teams from the Blue
and Gold. It is hoped that all eight
teams will be able to compete before
noon and arrangements are being made
for expert management of events to
make this possible.
