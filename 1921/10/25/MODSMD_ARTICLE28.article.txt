# Feminine Vanity Uses Sufficient Horse Hair To Upholster New Union
## 
### 
Fifty million dollars was spent by
the women of the United States for
hair nets in 1920, another indication
that the luxury of yesterday becomes
the necessity of today. In the num
| ber of nets that such an amoun would
purchase, there would be enough horse
hair to stuff a whole set of furniture
I for the new Union, or to fit out with
1 toupees all of the bald-headed men
: this side of the Rocky Mountains.
These many millions, spent on a
whim of feminine vanity, would be
| enough to endow a good-sized univer
j sity, or to furnish Christian hymn
books to a vast number of African
heretics. It is rumored that a cam
paign is about to be launched for the
suppression of this extravagant luxury
and for the expenditure of the money
so secured on overcoats for Mexican
hairless poodle-dogs.
