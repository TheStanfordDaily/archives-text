# NEW TENNIS COURT PLANS TO INSURE BEST OF LIGHTING
## 
### 
1 he plan of the new tennis courts
! row being completed north of the eat
ing clubs is to be a double row of
three, the nets to be at right angles to
the road. 1 liis will necessitate two back
stops across the hard surface, dividing
| the block into three sections of two
I courts each. This is in accordance with
! specifications on obtaining the best light,
! and follows loosely the idea incorpo
rated into the varsity courts. It was
thought to be better to have the courts
paralleling the road instead of at an
angle to it, as are the varsity, because
play would be going on at every hour
of the day, while most of the play on
those courts reserved for "S" players
would take place in the afternoon.
As soon as the final rolling takes place
the courts will be ready for the installa
tion of nets and backstops. The rolling
is at present held up while the oil is
getting into the proper condition, which
will probably take a day or two.
With a hard surface treatment the
same as that of University avenue, the
new Embarcadero road past the stadium
is now open. The final coats of oil and
screenings were made yesterday. The ex
tension of this road past the power
house to Encina will not be treated un
til spring, as it has not as firm a base,
and so will be allowed to settle.
