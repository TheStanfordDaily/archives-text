# LAUNDRY OWNERS SEEK PATRONS' UNDERSTANDING
## 
### 
"Visit Your Laundry Week" is
planned to make patrons more fa
miliar with modern laundries.
Although the laundry is said to be
doing the family washing for more
than a million American homes, it is
yet a little known institution to
many citizens. This, says a local
laundry owner, explains the reason
for "Visit Your Laundry Week,"
which is to be observed nationally,
October 24 to 29.
