# STANFORD SOCCER ELEVEN MAY TAKE TRIP TO TORONTO
## 
### 
There will be no quarter for the
soccer varsity this season, as the
prospective trip to Canada is nearer
a reality than ever before. Already
Coach Harry Maloney has had several
communications from the Toronto soc
cer officials in regard to the trip, and
he states that the Canadians are very
anxious to meet the Stanford eleven
in the English sport.
Final arrangements for the trip
hinge at present on the money ques
tion. Maloney has written to Dr.
Barton, director of physical training
at Toronto University, asking for a
guarantee of enough money to cover
expenses. If this guarantee is given,
Coach Maloney at present sees no
other difficulty in arranging for the
trip.
In case the soccer varsity make this
trip, they will play a series of four
games. The squad will leave here on
Decemeber 20» In order to be at To
ronto in time to play the first game
on Christmas day. They will play
their last game on New Year's day,
and will leave the same night.
At present, the routing of the trip
is uncertain. It is probable, however,
that the varsity will leave San Fran
cisco for Toronto by way of New
York. Efforts are now being made to
bring the squad back by one of the
Canadian railroads. As the time is
limited, it will be the greatest factor
in determining the route, and for this
reason the shortest route will be
taken.
If this trip turns out to be a reality,
it will be the first time that a Stan
ford soccer team has journeyed to a
foreign country. It has been talked
of for three or four years now, and
Coach Maloney is extremely anxious
that the dream be fulfilled this year
as he wishes to let some of the old
men on the soccer squad represent
Stanford against a foreign university.
Fifteen men will get berths. Of these
men, nearly all will be triple-letter
men in the sport.
Coach Maloney is desirous that the
Stanford aggregation go up to Toronto
as champions of the University and
Club Soccer League, and for this
reason he is putting the varsity
through an unusually heavy training
program.
