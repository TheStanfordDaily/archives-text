# STANFORD BOXERS 10 ENJOY BANNER YEAR WITH MITTS
## 
### 
According to Boxing Instructor Jim
mie Ross, the wielders of the padded
mitts are to have one of the best years
in the history of the sport.
"With most of last year's stars work
ing out daily in the gymnasium, and
with a wealth of new material, we ex
pect to turn out a squad that will give
the Blue and Gold a warm reception,"
says Instructor Ross. Bill Burkhard,-
star of last year's boxing squad, is help
ing to round the pugilists into shape,
and he can also be counted on to be
in the best shape to show any California
welterweights a good time. Burkhard
fights at 155 pounds.
Brad Simmons, '23, who won most of
his matches last year, is working out
daily and is in tip-top condition. He
can be counted upon to put up a good
battle against anyone in the 118-pound
class.
Mike Hodges, '22, the "Arizona Wild
cat," who showed a great deal of stuff
last year, failed to return this quarter,
and this leaves an opening in the 125-
pound class.
Walt Bihls and Johnnie Lane, the
two scrappy welterweights who met sev
eral times last year in an effort to de
termine the better man, are working
hard. It may be that they will settle the
old score this year.
Lindsay Gillis, '21, who fought under
George Blake of the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club last year, looks to be the class
in the 159-pound class, according to
Jimmie Ross. Gillis is fast and packs
a lot of stuff in either list. Ross intends
to start Gillis in the first match, and ex
pects great things from his "white
hope."
Mark Evans, '21, winner of the mid
dleweight title in the meet with Califor
nia last year, is fighting in the light
heavy class this year, and looks to be
even harder to beat than he was last
year.
Jimmie Ross, star in the 135-pound
class last year, will not compete this
season. This leaves an opening in the
lightweight class.
So far Harley Carter is the only
heavyweight to report for training, and
he should be in the best of condition by
the time the football season is over.
George Davis, '20, is showing a lot of
stuff in the 145-pound class, and looks
to be a comer.
With the interclass and intermural
bouts scheduled for the near future,
there is a good opportunity for new ma
terial to show up. "No one has his
place cinched on the squad, and I am
expecting some hot contests for the va
rious places," says Instructor Ross.
A definite date for the California
matches has not been named, but it is
expected that they will take place iti
the early part of the winter quarter.
