# Next Freshman Assembly Will Be Held Monday
## 
### 
No freshman "on the boat" assembly
was held last night, but Ross Fisher,
chairman of the Y. M. C. A. committee
on freshman assemblies, plans to have
one scheduled for next Monday.
It lias not been the intention to have
every Monday evening taken up with
these assemblies, but what ones there
are will come on Monday evenings. The
first two have been on Stanford history,
and instruction on yells and songs. The
next one will probably be on traditions,
past and present.
