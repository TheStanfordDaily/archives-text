# PLOT SUSPENSE DOMINATES IN PLAY ON FRIDAY
## 'Tailor-Made Man' Rehearsals Indicate Great Success in Sword, Sandals Production 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
He was a success! He had broken
into society's inner circle, he had made
friends with influence and lie had con
quered the city's proudest hearts in one
evening, lie turns from the satisfying
contemplation and, for all his poise,
shrinks from the sight which confronts
him.
The cowering figure of the servant is
electrified, too. Before him, in evening
dress, he sees the man who serves with
him by day in an ordinary shop, and
tonight it is his lot to bow to him in
livery. Amazed wrath clouds his face
and his frame shakes with bursting spite.
"What—what are you doing here?"
the butler bellows. "Here I find the
stolen dress suit. You have lost us a
good customer. You are an imposter.
I will expose you. You—"
But, as ever, it develops that silence
is golden. Where the difficulty arises is
in paying ofT the debt in greenbacks.
Exit villainous butler for awhile and
enter green pea. Whereupon the man
whose suit the imposter has stolen and
now wears is hit for a loan of fifty
dollars. The green pea is sorry but he
cannot oblige this evening. He says that
it certainly is too bad, et cetra, that he
has not his own suit on. for he would
have had all he needed then —and con
fesses the pocket. What a splendid
coincidence.
The incident is an extract from the
"Tailor Made Man." Les Seib plays the
magnetic adventurer who has his prob
lem solved so happily. A. D. Cohan and
Paul Claflin entertain as the butler and
green pea, respectively.
With a grumbling Scotch drawl, a
stooped figure and a sour look, A. D.
Cohan will dispense the "drrrinkthsh"
and comedy for the guests of the sec
ond act, Friday night.
A tailor by trade and a butler by sil
ver's persuasion, he passes Scotch, cham
pagne, and remarks until the sight of
him, in itself, calls up a smile. He has
a good, clear voice and a genuine sound
ing brogue which will distinguish him.
Claflin is every bit as good as Jellicot
as he was in last year's "Ram's Head"
show. His natural instinct for fun and
accent are alone almost worth going to
see. Besides his regular comedy, Claflin
has the opportunity to do quite a bit
with his costume. His dress is touted
as better than overalls but not quite
as good as golf knickers.
The faculty seat sale will be held
separately, as usual. A block of seats
have been set aside which are available
by telephoning Local 136 or calling at
the Associated Students' office in the
Administration building. These will be
held until Thursday evening when all
that remain will be put 011 public sale.

whose suit the imposter has stolen and
now wears is hit for a loan of fifty
dollars. The green pea is sorry but he
cannot oblige this evening. He says that
it certainly is too bad, et cetra, that he
has not his own suit on. for he would
have had all he needed then —and con
fesses the pocket. What a splendid
coincidence.
The incident is an extract from the
"Tailor Made Man." Les Seib plays the
magnetic adventurer who has his prob
lem solved so happily. A. D. Cohan and
Paul Claflin entertain as the butler and
green pea, respectively.
With a grumbling Scotch drawl, a
stooped figure and a sour look, A. D.
Cohan will dispense the "drrrinkthsh"
and comedy for the guests of the sec
ond act, Friday night.
A tailor by trade and a butler by sil
ver's persuasion, he passes Scotch, cham
pagne, and remarks until the sight of
him, in itself, calls up a smile. He has
a good, clear voice and a genuine sound
ing brogue which will distinguish him.
Claflin is every bit as good as Jellicot
as he was in last year's "Ram's Head"
show. His natural instinct for fun and
accent are alone almost worth going to
see. Besides his regular comedy, Claflin
has the opportunity to do quite a bit
with his costume. His dress is touted
as better than overalls but not quite
as good as golf knickers.
The faculty seat sale will be held
separately, as usual. A block of seats
have been set aside which are available
by telephoning Local 136 or calling at
the Associated Students' office in the
Administration building. These will be
held until Thursday evening when all
that remain will be put 011 public sale.
He was a success! He had broken
into society's inner circle, he had made
friends with influence and lie had con
quered the city's proudest hearts in one
evening, lie turns from the satisfying
contemplation and, for all his poise,
shrinks from the sight which confronts
him.
The cowering figure of the servant is
electrified, too. Before him, in evening
dress, he sees the man who serves with
him by day in an ordinary shop, and
tonight it is his lot to bow to him in
livery. Amazed wrath clouds his face
and his frame shakes with bursting spite.
"What—what are you doing here?"
the butler bellows. "Here I find the
stolen dress suit. You have lost us a
good customer. You are an imposter.
I will expose you. You—"
But, as ever, it develops that silence
is golden. Where the difficulty arises is
in paying ofT the debt in greenbacks.
Exit villainous butler for awhile and
enter green pea. Whereupon the man
whose suit the imposter has stolen and
now wears is hit for a loan of fifty
dollars. The green pea is sorry but he
cannot oblige this evening. He says that
it certainly is too bad, et cetra, that he
has not his own suit on. for he would
