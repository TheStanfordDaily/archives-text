# J. K. LILLY TO COACH LIGHTWEIGHT ELEVEN
## 
### 
J. K. Lilly, '19, has been appointed
by Walter Powell, director of athletics,
to coach the 135-pound football men.
Lilly is a Stanford four-star man, and
played in the backfield on the football
varsity against California in 1919. Since
that time he has been a season with the
baseball aggregation of the New York
Giants. A large squad of fifty or sixty
135-pound gridiron enthusiasts is clam
oring for instruction and will give Lilly
plenty of opportunity to develop a high
class lightweight eleven.
Scrimmage was held last night for the
first time. The lightweight men staged
informal battles among themselves for
about an hour. Then eleven of the 135-
pound squad started scrimmage with a
team of freshmen players. Starting
from the middle of the soccer field the
freshmen smashed their way to a touch
down. This process was repeated sev
eral times before the lightweight line
stiffened'and held for downs. The backs
did some rather, savage line-bucking,
but with the exception of a few times
were unable to gain much yardage
through the '25 men. Both teams used
only elementary plays, and as far as the
135-pound players are concerned, the
elements were meager since the men
have had no coach to give them instruc
tion. However, the work of individuals
among the lightweight squad is becom
ing noticeable and members of the first
eleven may be chosen within the week.
