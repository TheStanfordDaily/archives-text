# DR. G. J. PEIRCE Will LECTURE IN LITTLE THEATRE
## "Intellectual Curiosity" With Its Development and Loss To Be Theme of Discussion 
### 
"Don't close up your mind against
new things and new ideas, for as soon
as you do you begin to deteriorate and
go backward. Keep your intellectual cu
riosity alive." This is the point which
Professor George J. Peirce will stress
in his lecture at 7 :30 tomorrow evening
in tlie Little Theater. He says that from
the time when we are small children, we
begin shutting ourselves up and keeping
away from innovations. Children ask
dozens of questions each day, and their
parents tell them to be still. This makes
the children unconsciously begin to lose
some of their curiosity about things.
Mr. Peirce begs students and other
people to keep their minds open and
not to part with their natural intel
lectual curiosity.
Professor Peirce is head of the Bot
any Department and has been a member

United States Forest Service and as a
special agent for the Department of Jus
tice in studying the effect of smoke on
vegetation.
