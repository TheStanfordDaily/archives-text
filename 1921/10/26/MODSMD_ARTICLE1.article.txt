# COSTUMES OF PLAY APPEAR THIS EVENING
## Coach and Cast Make Record Time in Preparing Tailor-Made Man' for Presentation 
### 
Tonight the cast of the "Tailor Made
Man" will hold the first of the two dress
rehearsals. Less than three weeks have
been spent in preparation for this play,
which in many respects, is one of the
most difficult ever attempted by local
players. The large number of character
parts and the coordination of the cast
of thirty-one were the principle obstacles
which Coach Gordon Davis has en
countered, lie says.
All hut two or three of the prominent
persons of the play require individual
twist. Scotch, German, English, Cock
ney, and Socialcse are among the dia
lects encountered. Nearly every part
demands a distinctly different interpre
tation. The number of straight roles is
very small.
In the second act as many as twenty
eight people are on the stage at once.
This makes a colorful picture but de
mands careful management of the ac
tion. A reception is hard enough to
handle in private, but a reception scene
takes the gold, silver and bronze medals
together with the signatory gonfalon for
stubborness.
This act is the most interesting of the
play. The setting itself is the most elab
orate of all. P'astel gray walls are broken
by tall arches set off with red draperies.
Behind the series of arches a tall leaded
window stretches out of sight through
which the blue-black heavens can be
seen.
Most of the best comedy occurs in
this act. The tailor's assistant breaks
into the fashionable ball uninvited and in
stolen clothes. After getting by with
that, he meets the owner of the suit
and uses the money which he discloses
to pay off hi:> fellow worker, who threat
ens exposure. The widow's family is
met.
This is the scene in which the fair
feminine guests appear. Costumes have
been chosen with meticulous care and
all the advantage will he with the guests,
j The butlers, in their bright colored liver
ies, help to make the scene a riot of
color as Claflin's evening costume as
sists in making the act a riot of laughter.
The other scenes —a tailor shop and
a Wall street office—are unique enough
to cause many to sec the show again.
The locale, at least, is entirely different
from the usual country house-warming
or the city drawing room. It is such
minor excellences which kept the show
on Broadway for two seasons and 011
the road for three years.
Tn spite of the fact that the "Tailor
Made Marl" has just completed a run
in Los Angeles, where a good many
playgoers saw it, the scats have been
selling just as well as for any of last
season's successes, according to Dra
matic Manager Dick Taylor. Many, he
says, arc seeing the show twice.
Some good seats are still left on sale
at Crandall's and in the Administration
booth, but are selling fast. The block
of tickets which arc reserved for the
faculty are to be held in reserve for
them in the Associated Students' offices
until tomorrow evening when those re
maining will be available to the public.
