# LARGE TURN-OUT FOR HAMMER AND COFFIN PROMISES SUCCESS
## 
### 
First tryouts were held this afternoon
by Hammer and Coffin for the cast of
the Chappie football show next month.
A large amount of dramatic talent ap
peared at that time, and Coach Lester
Seib is highly gratified with the mate
rial thus far but hopes for a much larger
turnout in the tryouts tomorrow.
The production will need an excep
tionally large cast. A large number of
men and women prominent on the Stan
ford stage have signified their intention
of trying for a position in this cast. It
is also expected that a large number of
underclassmen will go out to win laurels
in this show.
In the meantime, the Chappies are ar
ranging for the musical and scenic ef
fects. There will be ten scencs, or epi
sodes, depicting various stages of cam
pus life arranged by various members
of the Chaparral staff.
Tryouts will be repeated again to
morrow afternoon from 2 until 5 in the
Assembly Hall, and in the evening at
the Women's Clubhouse from 7 until 9.
Semi-finals are to be held Saturday
morning and the cast definitely decided
upon by the first of next week.
