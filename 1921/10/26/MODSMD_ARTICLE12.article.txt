The Southern Pacific will handle the
enormous crowd which will pour down
the penninsula to Palo Alto on the day
of the Big Game by means of a tem
porary depot at Embarcadero road. The
location of the station is two blocks
from the stadium, and it is from there
that the special trains will start 011 their
return to San Francisco.
Work has already been started in prep
aration for the crowds. It is probable
that temporary ticket booths will be
erected, as the railway officials state
it is essential that everyone have their
return tickets purchased to avoid con
fusion.
