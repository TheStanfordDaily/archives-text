# CLOSE MATCHES ARE SLATED FOR WEEK'S PLAY IN HANDBALL
## 
### 
Drawings for sccond round play in
the handball tournaments have been
made and the end of the week should
virtually determine who are going to be
the new singles and doubles handball
champions.
The semi-finals have been reached in
the doubles contcst, and, unless one of
the "dark horse" teams springs a sur
prise, the final fight will lie between
Sansone and Cohen, of Encina, and Rut
ter and Retickcr, representing Delta Chi.
This week's schedule calls for six
matches in the singles tourney. The
headliner, and the one which will prob
ably provide the most excitement, will
be the clash between Sansone and Maier.
Both of them are veterans as veterans
go in the court game. Secondary inter
est lies in the W. W. Young-Blacker
match, as both of these men came
through the preliminary round with
ease and appear to be evenly matched.
The following matches arc to be
played off before next Saturday and
the results turned in :
Doubles—Sansone and Cohen vs
Preston and Brazil. Landweer and Sid
wav vs. Rutter and Retickcr.
Singles—Sansone vs. Maier; Homer
vs. L. Berry; Blacker vs. W. Young;
Rutter vs. Wohlbcrg; Farley vs. Cohen;
Badham vs. Retickcr.
