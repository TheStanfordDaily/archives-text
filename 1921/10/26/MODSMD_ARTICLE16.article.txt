# CARDS OPPOSE O.A.C. ELEVEN HERE SATURDAY
## "Scotch" Campbell May Be in Shape to Start Saturday's Battle With Northern Team 
### 
Stanford will face the Oregon Agri
cultural College football eleven in the
first conference struggle of the season
here Saturday afternoon with her lineup
practically intact.
That became known last night when
Coach Van Gent gave his ailing regu
lars the "once over." "Scotchy" Camp
bell is the only player of whom there is
any doubt. Campbell received an in
jury to his hip in the Pacific Fleet en
counter but is improving rapidly, He
was out in suit last night and the chances
are good that he will be ready when
the referee's whistle sounds Saturday.
Joe Douglas is still carrying liis arm
in a sling but should lie ready for active
work within another week. He will not
be able to play against the Aggies.
Van Gent sent the Cards through a
long practice last night, but many of the
first-string varsity did not get into the
fray aside from the signal drill. Cap
tain Patrick, Art Wilcox, Ludeke, Mertz
and several others took it easy.
The Stanford coaches have changed
the days on which secret practice will
be held. Hereafter the fans will be
barred from watching the workouts on
Wednesdays and Fridays instead of on
Tuesdays and Thursdays. The varsity
was working out tonight in secret.
According to all reports from the
north the Aggie's will bring to Stanford
the best football team that the institu
tion has had in many years. Practi
cally all of their men are experienced.
Their 24 to 0 win over the University
of Washington aggregation Saturday in
dicates that they will be a hard nut for
the Stanford team to crack.
The Aggies scored in every quarter
on Washington, despite the fact that
during the later part of the game the
team was made up largely of substi
tutes.
"Gap" Powell, fullback, and a man of
considerable experience on the grid, is
captain of the Aggie eleven, lie is a big
fellow and will probably be the hardest
line-plunger that the Cards will have to
stop this season. Kasberger, quarter
hack, will also bear watching as he was
the whole show in the Washington af
fair.
The Oregon Aggies tied the strong
Multnomah Club outfit early in the sea
son. Multnomah beat the Olympic Club
Sunday in San Francisco 24 to 3. Fig
ure for yourself whether the Aggies are
strong.
Officials for the big game between
California and Stanford have been def
initely announced, following a confer
ence between Coaches Van Gent and
Andy Smith of the Bruins.
George Varnell (Chicago) of Spo
kane will referee, "Hub" Hubel (Michi
gan) will umpire, Ben Brownell (Whit
tier) will be the field judge, and George
Humphries will be head linesman.

Officials for the big game between

ence between Coaches Van Gent and
Andy Smith of the Bruins.

kane will referee, "Hub" Hubel (Michi

Stanford will face the Oregon Agri
cultural College football eleven in the
first conference struggle of the season
here Saturday afternoon with her lineup
practically intact.
That became known last night when
Coach Van Gent gave his ailing regu
lars the "once over." "Scotchy" Camp
bell is the only player of whom there is
any doubt. Campbell received an in
jury to his hip in the Pacific Fleet en
counter but is improving rapidly, He
was out in suit last night and the chances
are good that he will be ready when
the referee's whistle sounds Saturday.
Joe Douglas is still carrying liis arm
in a sling but should lie ready for active
work within another week. He will not
be able to play against the Aggies.
Van Gent sent the Cards through a
long practice last night, but many of the
first-string varsity did not get into the
fray aside from the signal drill. Cap
tain Patrick, Art Wilcox, Ludeke, Mertz
and several others took it easy.
The Stanford coaches have changed
the days on which secret practice will
be held. Hereafter the fans will be
barred from watching the workouts on
Wednesdays and Fridays instead of on
Tuesdays and Thursdays. The varsity
was working out tonight in secret.
According to all reports from the
north the Aggie's will bring to Stanford
the best football team that the institu
tion has had in many years. Practi
cally all of their men are experienced.
Their 24 to 0 win over the University
of Washington aggregation Saturday in
dicates that they will be a hard nut for
the Stanford team to crack.
The Aggies scored in every quarter
on Washington, despite the fact that
during the later part of the game the
team was made up largely of substi
tutes.
"Gap" Powell, fullback, and a man of
considerable experience on the grid, is
captain of the Aggie eleven, lie is a big
fellow and will probably be the hardest
line-plunger that the Cards will have to
stop this season. Kasberger, quarter
hack, will also bear watching as he was
the whole show in the Washington af
fair.
