# WOMEN WILL SEND REPRESENTATIVE TO BERKELEY MEETING
## 
### 
Stanford is entitled to send one vot
ing representatives to the Women's In
tercollegiate Conference which is to be
held in Berkeley from November 7 to
10. The delegates are allotcd on the
basis of the number of women to be
represented, at least one being sent from
every student body, and an additional
delegate being allowed for every five
hundred women over an initial thousand.
California is therefore entitled to have
seven representatives at the conference.
Although we arc to have only one
vote, it is probable that we will, never
theless, send at least one other delegate
to attend the convention. Women's con
ference is to vote this afternoon on the
two representatives who will go. In ad
dition to these delegates sent from Or
ganized Women at large, the Y. W.
C. A. is also invited to send one non
voting representative.
It is the plan of the conference to
i have groups of representatives from
different universities handle the various
problems which confront the women in
our colleges. Our delegate will be asked
to cover the subject of raising the schol
arship, a problem in which all collegiate
institutions arc at present vitally inter
ested.
