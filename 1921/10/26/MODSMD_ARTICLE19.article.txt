# Is Stanford Interested?
## 
### 
A movement is being launched among the uni
versities of the country to promote discussion on the
question of international disarmament in order that
resolutions and recommendations may be forwarded
to our representatives at that meeting. The United
States has been divided into working units, and it
is planned to have each University sound the feelings
of the students in regard to this move to promote a
permanent peace by means of assemblies.
Stanford is particularly fortunate in being able to
have Chester 11. Rowell, who is recognized as one
of the leading journalists of the country, present his
views on the subject. Rowell has investigated con
ditions in Japan and the Orient, and his ideas, inde
pendently expressed as they always are, should aid
his hearers in forming opinions on this issue.
Chester H. Rowell is being brought here by the
Y. M. C. A. for the purpose of promoting an under
standing among the students on the subject of inter
national disarmament, and as many of the under
graduate and graduate members of the student body
as can crowd into the Little Theatre tonight should
hear him.
