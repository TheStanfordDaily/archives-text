# BABE SWIMMERS WILL MEET LOWELL MERMEN
## 
### 
Coach Ernie Brandsten's aggregation
of freshmen swimmers will make its
initial public appearance next Saturday
morning, when the team meets with
the fast Lowell High mermen from San
Francisco at the Encina gymnasium
pool.
The first-year paddlers will go into
the meet with little known of their abil
ity. Their showing in the recent inter
class swim, when they placed third to
the sophomores and juniors, was noth
ing more than ordinary. On the other
hand, some good material was brought
to light in that meet, and several of the
Babes have shown promise in the early
season workouts.
Year in and year out, Lowell High
School lias developed a swimming team
that has been among the leaders in the
prep school circles of Northern Califor
nia. The annual aquatic meet held un
der the auspices of the San Francisco
Athletic League, proved to be easy pick
ings for the Lowell swimmers, who
swam away handily with first honors
some thirty points ahead of their near
est opponents.
The freshmen have a fast trio for the
fifty-yard event in Captain-elect Kle
bahn. Hooper and McCallister. Hooper
has been churning the water in fine
style in the short dash, and should be
among those present when the judges
start counting the winners next Satur
day. He comes from Lowell, so lie will
be in friendly competition with his old
classmates.
Peters knocked the dope into a cocked
hat when he eased himself into second
place in the 220 at the interclass, and
he will be counted on to do most of the
scoring for the freshmen in this event.
Belcher is another one who showed up
well in the meet last Thursday, placing
second to Greppin in the 220. Young, in
the back stroke, and Scluneider in the
breast stroke, look able to add some
points to the Babes' sides of the score
board.
With the exception of Rising in the
plunge for distance, Brandsten has al
most no one upon whom he can rely in
the diving events. Lowell will probably
gather the majority of points in thetse
events. The 50 and 220 will be nip and
tuck races between Lowell's fast men
and the Cardinal swimmers.
