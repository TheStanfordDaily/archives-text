# What's the Answer?

It takes a better man than the famed Philadelphia
lawyer to figure out replies for the numerous saluta
tions that one receives in a single day on the Stan
ford campus. Unless you stop to think about them
you do not realize that there are almost as many
different greetings as there are men in the Univer
sity and to answer each one rationally one would
either have to be a choice liar or a confirmed wit.
Probably the first fellow you encounter in the
morning says, "YVaddayouknow?" The second one
asks, "Waddayousay?" If you were to stop and
tell the first one all you know or what you think you
know, pretty much of the day would be wasted.
Anyway, he is not sincere. The common rejoinder
to the second is, "Save your money." Since the
practice of thrift has fallen into disuse during the
past two or three years, you merely grunt, and reply,
"Not much."
I he next gent who salutes you will likely say,
"What's the dope?" Not knowing the dope, nor
what he means by the word, the normal reply is
"Hello." You next is, "How're they going ?" Now,
your interrogator may be referring to the hairs on
your head, the package of cigarettes in your pocket
or a number of other things that go nobody knows
where. In this case the stereotyped reply is "Good."
You are about ready for some tight-lipped gentle
man who merely asks, "Howzit?" "Good" is the
safest comeback again, since you can't determine
what he means by it.
And so it goes throughout the day, and no two
greetings alike. That "variety is the spice of life"
is illustrated by these practices, for every person
goes through them day after day, but since no two
are repeated during the same twenty-four hour pe
riod, there is no monotony. It is a typically Ameri
can practice and one that serves to make faster
friends of new acquaintances and to solidify old
friendships. 1 lie salutations are in themselves mean
ingless. Jt is the spirit that prompts them that makes
the days brighter.
