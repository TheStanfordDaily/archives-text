# Bleacher Competition
## 
### 
Stanford may well take a lesson in the vocifer
ous art of rooting from the exhibition of the Pacific
Fleet supporters during last Saturday's contest. A
couple of hundred sailors and fifty or sixty commis
sioned and non-commissioned officers of the navy
came mighty near to outshouting the Cardinal stands.
They were prompted by pride in the team which is
the main motive for vocal support of any organiza
tion. Surely Stanford is proud of its fighting foot
ball team.
And while the supporters of the fleet team were

! shouting they did not forget the little details that
give finish to a rooting section and put the stamp
of true sportsmanship upon it. For instance in the
first quarter, when a Stanford player was taken
from the game because of an injury they beat the
Cardinal section to the three cheers and they also
added his name. Ordinarily a visiting contingent is
content to make their cheer an anonymous one by
pronouncing three for "Stanford man."
It becomes more apparent with every game that
there is lots of work ahead of the Stanford rooters
if the bleacher display during the Big Game is to
measure up to the standards of last and of preceding
years. This year it will be necessary to do more than
measure up to precedent: we must surpass all pre
vious performances. Never before in the history of
Big Games has a special section been reserved by
Stanford alumni on the California side in order that
they can see the Stanford section in action. Is the
Stanford undergraduate body going to disappoint
these loyal alumni who expect just this little from
us? Less than a month remains for the students
to demonstrate vocally and through their presence at
every rally and every game that they are ready to do
their share toward making the bleacher display the
best ever seen at an intercollegiate contest on this
coast. Less than a month remains for the Veil
Leader and his assistants and the Stunt Committee
to show that they are 011 the job by starting the real
intensive work which should be started now if it is
to be finished by November 19.
