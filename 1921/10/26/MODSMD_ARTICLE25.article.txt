"Citrus Leaves," a magazine edited
by Bruce McDaniel, 'IS, for the Mutual
Orange Distributors is receiving wide
attention from exporters and import
ers, both in the United States and
abroad. The editor is a member of
the local chapter of Kappa Sigma and
Phi Alpha Delta.
A letter from Horace W. Cutler,
special agent of the Department of
Commerce, states that the magazine
is a very helpful one in the orange
industry. In it American representa
tives of the citrus industry and those
interested are given due cridt
for their work. In other publications
this is often overlooked.
Some of the articles are being re
tained by the Department of Com
merce as records for reference work.
Numbers of items by such men
as David Starr Jordan, Henry C. Wal
lace, and Roger Babson, are printed
I in "Citrus Leaves."
