# STANFORD, OLYMPICS LEAD SOCCER LEAGUE
## 
### 
As both tlie Stanford varsity and
the Olympic Club's soccer teams were
victorious in their games of lust Sat
urday, the fight for the championship
of the University and Club Soccer
League seems to have simmered down
to a neck and neck race between the
Cardinals and the Winged O. Cali
fornit at present is out of the running
as the Bears lost their first game to
the Olympic Club by a score of 3-0.
This gives the Bruins a third place
or a possible tie for second.
Both the Olympics and the varsity
are now busy training for their game
which will take place on Nevember
sth, or two weeks from next Satur
day. Coach Maloney has developed
some new combinations on the line
that he feels confident will greatly
benefit the scoring possibilities of the
Cardinal squad. The Olympic Club
game will, from the present dope, be
Stanford's hardest opponent in the
eague. If Stanford overcomes this
difficulty, they should, barring injuri
es repeat last year's non-defeat record.
If Stanford wins the game from the
Olympics the varsity will lead the
league.
The soccer squad is practicing every
night now, and every man is going
out to win for the second consecutive
year.
