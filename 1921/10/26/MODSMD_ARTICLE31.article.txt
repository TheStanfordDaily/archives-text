Words to the effect that "Roble
j Bridge is falling down," as spread
I about the campus via the newspaper
route, are substantiated in today's re
port that .the old crossing is still
falling. It's a case of present tense,
as well as a tense present for the
casual passerby whb drops into one
of the holes provided by Father Time
and Uncle Wear and Tear.
If the old land mark isn't rehabili
tated pretty soon, some stroller may
not be so fortunate as the unknown
gent who fell through last night and
escaped before his shouts for assist
ance could be answered. Danger
signals, barricades and immediate re
pair are knocking for admittance.
Opportunity waits without. Who has
the key?
