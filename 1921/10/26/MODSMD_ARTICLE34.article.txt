Prohibition does not bother the stu
dents of the Stanford summer field work
in geology in dealin gwith rattlesnake
hites. They do not rely on whisky, but
instead carry in their hip pockets bottles
of potassimu permanganate. The story
of how Joe Show, son of the late Pro
fessor Arley B. Show of the Stanford
history faculty, and a student member
of the Stanford geological survey in
Ventura county, this summer saved his
life has just become generally known
on the campus, and explodes the old
theory of the efficacy of whisky in such
emergencies. Show would probably have
died if he had taken whisky. Even fol
lowing the rules laid down by Profes
sor C. F. Tolman, Jr., head of the ex
pedition, Show had a narrow escape.
Show and his partner, Carlton Car
son, known as "Kit" Carson, of Palo
Alto, were working about three miles
from the road up Dry Canyon. When
Show picked up his lunch from the foot
of a tree, where he had placed it, a
rattlesnake, without warning, struck
him twice in the wrist. He used the

I required remedies at once, but was,
nevertheless, so seriously affected for an
hour and a half that Carson did not
dare to leave him to go for aid. Show
had convulsions and his joints stiffened
up. After an hour and a half he had
improved sufficiently so that Carson was
able to leave him to go to the main
camp for aid. From there Tom Hamlyn
of San Francisco, the manager of the
camp, and Andrew Mackenzie of Palo
Alto, one of the instructing assistants
of the survey, went to Show's aid and,
partly carrying him and partly helping
him to walk, got him over the three
mile trail to an automobile, in which he
was taken to a physician in Newhall.
The doctor said that the prompt first
aid treatment had undoubtedly saved
Show's life and that he was out of
danger.
Show was able to return to the work
in a week, although his arm was still
swollen and his joints were stiff.
The rattler which bit Show escaped
into its hole unharmed.
After Show had his experience there
was not a man in the Stanford survey
party who did not see to it that he had
bis permanganate bottle anil bis clean
knife-blade always with him.
