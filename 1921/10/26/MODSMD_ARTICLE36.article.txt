# Mayfield Highway Will Be Ready For Big Game
## 
### 
The announcement made yesterday In
state highway engineers in charge of
construction work in the town of May
field that the highway through that town
will be completed and open for use of
the public on November 16. will be of
great interest to many Stanford people
who make frequent trips to San Jose
or thereabouts.
An announcement was recently made
that this road would not be completed
before January 1, 1922. This aroused
the chambers of commerce of several
near-by towns with the result that the
work will lie completed a great deal
sooner than was expected.
This early date of opening will great
ly aid in the handling of the crowds that
will come from the south for the Big
Game.
