# WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YEAST IN THE BEER COUNTRY
## 
### 
From a land where real beer may
still be bought and enjoyed under the
benign protection of legality comes an
interesting account of yeast, all that,
is left to us in the remembrance of
old days.
Brewer's yeast, say our late ene
mies, has been a household remedy
for ages and has stood the test well.
Just how it works, the scientists don't
seem able to decide. But it is pre
sumed to stimulate digestion, to act
as a mild laxative and to destroy the
taxic bacteria in the intestines. Al
though generally used in treating skin
disorders, stomach trouble and consti
pation, it has other successes to its
credit. It is claimed that in the city
of Breslau the lives of many stricken
with the plague during an epidemic
were saved by eating yeast.
There is a great difference between
the brewer's yeast obtained in Bavaria
where the use of ingredients other
than hops and malt is prohibited and
the yeast of northern Germany which
is not so carefully made.
It is well known that brewer's yeast
is hard to get and that it retains its
freshness and vigor only a short time.
Modern science has helped us out with
compressed yeast which is easy to get
and easy to keep. If kept in a cool
place a cake of compressed yeast will
stay fresh for a week. Advt.
