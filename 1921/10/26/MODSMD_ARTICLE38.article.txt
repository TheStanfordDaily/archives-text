# YEAR'S PLANS MADE FOR ENGLISH CLUB AT BUSINESS MEET
## 
### 
Many plans for the year's activities
were made by the members of the Eng
lish Club at a meeting held last night
in the Women's Clubhouse at 8 o'clock.
It was decided to procure the first night
of winter quarter for a registration day
dance, which will be the first campus
dance that the English Club has ever
given.
Nothing definite was determined about
the annual play which the organization
stages every year, except that it will
probably come winter quarter.
A change was made in the rules con
cerning admission to membership, so
that in addition to those admitted by
election, those marrying members of the
club automatically become part of the
organization. In this way Mrs. Robin
Lampson, and Mr. A. Allen, to whom
Dorothy Iloskins, '21, was recently mar
ried, have become members of the Eng
lish Club. Several students were also
elected, and will be announced soon.
The round table discussion which had
been planned for the evening was dis
pensed with, as the business of the meet
ing took up the entire time. Refresh
ments were served by Mollie \\ indish,
'22, and Dorothy Pierce, '23.
