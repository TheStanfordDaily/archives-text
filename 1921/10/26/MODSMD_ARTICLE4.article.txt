# ROWELL LECTURES TONIGHT ON JAPAN
## Disarmament and Problems of Orient Will be Topics of Speech in Little Theatre 
### 
"Japan and the United States on Dis
armament" will be the topic of a talk to
be given tonight by Chester Rowell, in
the Little Theater, at 7:30, under the
auspices of the World Problems Forum
of the local Y. M. C. A. organization.
Rowell is at present a member of the
California State Railway Commission,
but he is perhaps the best known to the
public at large as the former editor of
the Fresno Republican, which was ac
tive in political leadership in California
while he held the reins. Last spring he
delivered an address here before a stu
dent body assembly.
Shortly after his appearance here in
the spring quarter, Rowell left for an
extensive tour of Japan. He went with
the intention of studying the peculiar
conditions existing there, especially in
regard to their relation with world-wide
problems, fie returned to the United
States the first part of this autumn, after
having gained an intimate first-hand
view into the situation which Japan
faces.
The main theme of Rowell's speech
will be the attitude which Japan is likely
to take toward disarmament when the
principal powers of the world meet
around the conference table at Wash
ington on November 11, the anniversary
of Armistice Day, and what effect this
attitude will have on the policies of the j
United States.
Japan, being the last nation to accept \
the offer to attend jhe disarmament con
ference ,has been looked upon by most
observers as being one of the puzzles of
the present intricate international tan
gle. She wished to have certain tilings
understood before she committed her
self in any way, and it is this reserved
ness that has caused particular specula
tion as to what her course will be when
the time comcs for laying down the
cards and showing what is in every
hand, with no diplomatic bluffing to mix
the issues.
Japan is at this time a nation of rap
idly growing population, with her terri
torial expansion far behind even her
immediate needs. She sees clearly her
need of expansion, and it is the con
census of trained observers that the
coming confercncc will find her sticking
to preserve her national life.
The whole question of disarmament
can not, as have most of the newspapers
over the country pointed out, be settled
without removing the present causes of
friction, especially in the Pacific ocean
area. No nation is likely to scrap its
means of self-defense until it believes
imminent harm is out of the way. Thus
the question of disarmament, Japan, and
the relation of the two to the United
States, all become involved in one; and
what they mean and the possible an
swer, if there is any, will be discussed
by Rowell tonight.

swer, if there is any, will be discussed
by Rowell tonight.
"Japan and the United States on Dis
armament" will be the topic of a talk to
be given tonight by Chester Rowell, in
the Little Theater, at 7:30, under the
auspices of the World Problems Forum
of the local Y. M. C. A. organization.
Rowell is at present a member of the
California State Railway Commission,
but he is perhaps the best known to the
public at large as the former editor of
the Fresno Republican, which was ac
tive in political leadership in California
while he held the reins. Last spring he
delivered an address here before a stu
dent body assembly.
Shortly after his appearance here in
the spring quarter, Rowell left for an
extensive tour of Japan. He went with
the intention of studying the peculiar
conditions existing there, especially in
regard to their relation with world-wide
problems, fie returned to the United
States the first part of this autumn, after
having gained an intimate first-hand
view into the situation which Japan
faces.
The main theme of Rowell's speech
will be the attitude which Japan is likely
to take toward disarmament when the
principal powers of the world meet
around the conference table at Wash
ington on November 11, the anniversary
of Armistice Day, and what effect this
attitude will have on the policies of the j
United States.
Japan, being the last nation to accept \
the offer to attend jhe disarmament con
ference ,has been looked upon by most
observers as being one of the puzzles of
the present intricate international tan
gle. She wished to have certain tilings
understood before she committed her
self in any way, and it is this reserved
ness that has caused particular specula
tion as to what her course will be when
the time comcs for laying down the
cards and showing what is in every
hand, with no diplomatic bluffing to mix
the issues.
Japan is at this time a nation of rap
idly growing population, with her terri
torial expansion far behind even her
immediate needs. She sees clearly her
need of expansion, and it is the con
census of trained observers that the
coming confercncc will find her sticking
to preserve her national life.
The whole question of disarmament
can not, as have most of the newspapers
over the country pointed out, be settled
without removing the present causes of
friction, especially in the Pacific ocean
area. No nation is likely to scrap its
means of self-defense until it believes
imminent harm is out of the way. Thus
the question of disarmament, Japan, and
the relation of the two to the United
States, all become involved in one; and
what they mean and the possible an
swer, if there is any, will be discussed
by Rowell tonight.
