Silk pajamas, cotton pajamas; white
pajamas, pink pajamas; clean pajamas,
dirty pajamas; old pajamas, new paja
mas—anything was in order last night
when Encina's Knights of the Undress
paraded forth on their mission of ex
hibition. Some sprung the unexpected
and appeared in good old-fashioned
night shirts. As usual, the co-eds en
joyed the spectacle immensely, and voted
it a huge success. More than four hun
dred roughs posed for the picture on
the front steps of the Hall. The line
of march led first to the Library, where
the marauders filed past lines of red
fire. Roble was the next objective where
Madamamoselle Samuella Mendenhall
put on a fine exhibition of esthetic danc
ing for the benefit of the fair co-eds.

tunate queeners were properly repri
manded.
