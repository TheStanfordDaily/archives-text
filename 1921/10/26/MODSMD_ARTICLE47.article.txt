formulated this year, it is planned to
have a meeting of the whole membership
at least once a quarter, and the stag to
be given tomorrow evening will serve
as the opening meeting of the year. Cab
inet meetings are held once a week, but
they serve more especially as executive
sessions where the chairmen of the va

taken in this year, which amount to a
large nubmer, into intimate touch with
the older members of the organization.
The stag will commence at 7 :30 sharp
and will be over by 9 o'clock, according
] to an announcement made by the enter
tainment committee.
