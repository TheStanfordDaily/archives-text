# Decision is Postponed Until Saturday on Big Game Stunt Suggestions
## 
### 
The final date for submission of
bleacher stunts in the $10 prize con
test has been set over until the last of
the week by Yell Leader Connolly. A
number of possibilities of great poten
tiality have been turned in so far, but
a more general expression of campus
ideas on this subject is desired. Con
nolly says that the stunt this year will
he attempted on a huge scale, and no
stunts not entirely original and spec
tacular will he considered. He declares
that Stanford's reputation for sensational
bleacher stunts, as evidenced by the
reservation of a block of seats opposite
the rooting section, for the purpose of
viewing the Cardinal stunt, must not
only be maintained but surpassed.
Stunt suggestions may be filed with
either Connolly or Homer Mitchell.
