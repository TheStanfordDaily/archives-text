# "INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY" IS LECTURE TOPIC
## Professor G. J. Peirce Advises Students to Remain Curious and to Question Old Ideas 
### 
"I plead for the retention, as long as
possible, of those curiosities which make
people go out and question commonly
believed doctrines and find out new
things for themselves," said Professor
Peirce in his lecture on "Intellectual
Curiosity" last evening in the Little
Theater. Professor Peirce made his
talk informal and filled it with amusing
anecdotes and remarks.
He explained that children have more
curiosity than other people and that
everything which they do is done out of
their powers of accurate observation and
imitation and above all, their curiosity.
As soon as they learn to ask questions
they are told to be still and this starts
the gradual closing of their minds and
loss of curiosity. By the time a student
comes to college he has a small amount
of his natural curiosity left. "There are
many things," said Professor Peirce, "of
which I am not curious and have not
been curious for many years. One of
those is mathematics." He told of a
friend of his who is no longer young
who has recently taken up astronomy.
Dr. Peirce used this man as an example
of a person whose intellectual curiosity
is not dead and who still can find some
interest in life and something to live
for.
"The purpose of the Tuesday evening
meetings is to stimulate the minds of
those who come and set them to working
along new lines. That is the reason for
the variety of subjects which are treated
of in the Tuesday lectures. Very often
a student comes to Stanford who has
not had opportunities to be informed
along certain lines of thought, and these
lectures bring new interest to him which
he later pursues more deeply.
"There has been a great change in
Stanford since 1 came here. At that
time there was almost no music at the
University. Now there is an extraor
dinary amount of it in relation to the
size of community. This growth has
been caused by the work of musicians
of this locality and wives of the mem
bers of the faculty. Miss Marker was
instrumental in starting the Penninsula
concerts which every year bring four
great artists to Stanford. The organ re
citals in the Memorial Clinrch do much
for the intellectual culture of the com
munity. Each program which is given
is arranged to meet the tastes of every
one. The more wc cultivate our senses,
the more we suffer when we hear or see
something that is not of high standard."
Students bring to college a large num
ber of conceptions and ideas that they
have always believed because their par
ents or friends believed them. College
is the time to question all of these ideas
and discover their true worth. These
years of questioning, in the opinion of
Professor Peirce, are generally unhappy
ones if the student finds that his old
beliefs are wrong; but if he continues ,
his investigations and finds answers to
his questions, he is the possessor of
something valuable which he has made
for himself.
"The ideal scientific man is one who
is willing to examine all new ideas and
find, if he can, their intrinsic value. But
most scientific men are not ideal and
most of them have preconceived dogmas
which they will not investigate. There
is no harm in accepting an hypothesis
and discovering if it be true. Almost
any so-called scientific fact will bear in
spection. All the great discoveries of
the world have been made by the ques
tioner and the doubter.
"There is such a variety of interests
offered at Stanford that every student i
should be able to find something new
to stimulate his mind. Just how much
is your mind closed when you are alone?
How much can you stand being alone?
Do you get bored and lonesome when
you are by yourself? If you do it is
because you are losing your intellectual
curiosity."
