# FIRST PLAY OF SEASON IS BIG BROADWAY HIT
## "Tailor-Made Man" Steps Into His Suit for First Dress Rehearsal; Works Out Well 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
Tomorrow night Sword and Sandals
opens Stanford's theatrical season with
the "Tailor Made Man," a three-act
comedy by H. J. Smith. Friday even
ing's performance will mark one of the
first amateur showings of this play. It
has just been released after three years
of success in New York and on the
road.
Harry J. Smith, who wrote the lines
of the "Tailor Made Man," is recog

Gordon Davis says that Smith is re

Cohan's plays.
The story is that a tailor's assistant
who has read of success in connection
with such words as "personality, des

to put what he lias learned into the
business of making money. All that lie
knows has been taken from a book writ
ten by his rival for the hand of the
boss' daughter who, however, cannot
put his own idea over.
Les Seib plays the role of John Paul
Bart, the tailor's assistant. Bart per
forms the feat of lifting himself into
fame and fortune practically by his boot
straps. In a stolen suit of clothes, he
makes his how, uninvited, at a recep
tion given by one of the most exclusive
social-climbers. At this affair he meets
the rich shipping magnate, played in a
comprehensive way by Nelson Black,
and Bart convinces him that he saved
his life, although it was another who
did, and that it would be nice of him to
shake his hand. Whereupon personality
is taken out, dusted off and manipulated
to best dazzle the merchant prince. It
does.
Justice, meanwhile, obligingly keeps
the bandage on her eyes, and though
Bart uses both the dress suit and the
