# FIRST PLAY OF SEASON IS BIG BROADWAY HIT
## "Tailor-Made Man" Steps Into His Suit for First Dress Rehearsal; Works Out Well 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
Tomorrow night Sword and Sandals
opens Stanford's theatrical season with
the "Tailor Made Man," a three-act
comedy by H. J. Smith. Friday even
ing's performance will mark one of the
first amateur showings of this play. It
has just been released after three years
of success in New York and on the
road.
Harry J. Smith, who wrote the lines
of the "Tailor Made Man," is recog
nized as one of the foremost construc
tors of Broadway successes. Coach
Gordon Davis says that Smith is re
sponsible for perhaps more hits than
any of his colleagues, for it was he who
is called in to doctor up the weakening
lines of a potential success. As well as
being a Smith farce, the comedy is a
George M. Cohan production, which
fact assures a polish distinctive of all
Cohan's plays.
The story is that a tailor's assistant
who has read of success in connection
with such words as "personality, des
tiny, courage, poise." He is determined
to put what he lias learned into the
business of making money. All that lie
knows has been taken from a book writ
ten by his rival for the hand of the
boss' daughter who, however, cannot
put his own idea over.
Les Seib plays the role of John Paul
Bart, the tailor's assistant. Bart per
forms the feat of lifting himself into
fame and fortune practically by his boot
straps. In a stolen suit of clothes, he
makes his how, uninvited, at a recep
tion given by one of the most exclusive
social-climbers. At this affair he meets
the rich shipping magnate, played in a
comprehensive way by Nelson Black,
and Bart convinces him that he saved
his life, although it was another who
did, and that it would be nice of him to
shake his hand. Whereupon personality
is taken out, dusted off and manipulated
to best dazzle the merchant prince. It
does.
Justice, meanwhile, obligingly keeps
the bandage on her eyes, and though
Bart uses both the dress suit and the
life-saving story of the Englishman,
Jellicot, he obtains the membership in
the lonian Yacht Club for him, which
is probably more than Jellicott, played up
to his funniest by Paul Clafiin, could
have done for himself. However, Hart
does it. He puts over his ideas, settles
a strike and becomes the well known
"essential factor" in the commercial ma
chine.
Besides his business enterprise, the
tailor made man finds spare time to
conquer all the feminine hearts within
miles around. Like moths around a
flame the women throng to secure his
smile. The boss' daughter, Tanya, whose
innocent sweetness is interpreted by
Dorothy Woodhead, is the final victor
and after nearly all is said and done,
the bubble being broken and Bart back
at the ironing board, the match is made.
Then, after a parting storm scene from
the villain, and the touching appeal of
big business, so touching that Bart con
dercends to take the million dollar op
portunity and save things, the curtains
are gently lowered before the cheering
audience.
Last night's dress rehearsal was
something unique in rehearsals. Every
body did well. The production, as a
whole, showed that it was fit for presen
tation at a moment's notice. Scenic ef
fects and action appear to be good, and
Coacli Davis expresses great satisfaction
as the show nears completion, touting
it as a knockout.
Many of the southern contingent who
saw the stock company play the comedy
in Los Angeles are seeing it again, Dra
matic Manager Dick Taylor said today,
and these, together with the rest of the
University, are gradually buying up all
the seats, only a few remaining on sale
in Crandall's and the Administration
booth today. He says that though the
boxoffice sales may not be large, he be
lieves that it will not be because of
lack of candidates.
