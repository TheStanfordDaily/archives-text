# SLICK SOPHOMORES PLAY PRANKS ON BOISTEROUS BABES
## 
### 
Bawling babies and boisterous brats
with pink cheeks and corkscrew curls
brushed breathlessly about. Noisy nurses,
morose maids and garrulous guardians
clung to their toothless torments after
a Roble roast beef repast. All-day suck
ers and lemon lozenges stickily stuck to
freshmen fiingers with the party at its
pinnacle of progression.
While Ba-Ba-Black Sheep and Bve-
Baby-Bunting were being rashly sung
by chubby children, slick sophomores
slipped through the halls in hot haste,
whisking white footwear far from the
phrenetical frosh.
Handsome heroes and freckled friends
on football teams beamed down on cu
rious callers from the massive mantel
in the large lobby. Surreptitous sopho
mores had ravaged the rooms of frolick
ing freshmen at the Baby banquet.
