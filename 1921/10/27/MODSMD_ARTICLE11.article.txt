# STADIUM PLANTING IS NEARING COMPLETION
## 
### 
Stanford's $210,000 stadium is prac
tically completed.
Most of the work from now until the
Big Game with California, on Novem
ber 19, will be done on the turf. All of
the grass for the playing field has been
planted and it is expected that the turf
will be in good condition by the time
of the opening afternoon.
Workmen have completed the big
press box which is situated at the top
of the stands on the south side of the
field. Three models were investigated
before one was picked that was con
sidered satisfactory. Four rows of seats
were taken up in order to accommodate
the telegraphic instruments and tele
phones that will be installed by press
service at the Big Game.
The, sections to be occupied by the
Stanford and California rooters are to
be united so that there will be no break
at the aisles.
Gates have already been installed at
the main entrance and a high barbed
wire fence is being constructed around
the entire stadium. There will be little
chance of any small boys climbing the
fence to see the game.
The aisles have been painted green,
which adds to the appearance of the
bleachers. The seats themselves will not
be painted. Numbers will be branded.
If the goal posts were installed and
white yard lines were painted across
the field the Big Game could be played
tomorrow, if appearances count for any
thing.
