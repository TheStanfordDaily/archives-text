# Forty Fearful Freshmen Hear Soph Doom Book
## 
### 
Roosting on the Economics steps,
thirty or forty gray-dinked personages
listened in awed silence this morning
while the long heralded sophomore
doom-book was read. A list captioned
"Cocky Frosh" was received in chilled
anticipation by the huddled throng.
Members of the '25 class were informed
that absence of the honored headgear
had been carefully noted.
As a preliminary to possible events,
various stunts were enjoyed vociferously
by a large crowd. Some performers,
conspicuous for the lack of shoes, col
lars and neckties customary even at
Stanford, gave their prep school yells
and rendered songs in many parts. Tin
order of the day seemed to be rolled
ii]) trousers.
