# J. Pluvius Not Counted On For Big Game Day
## 
### 
If Jupiter Pluvius takes it upon him
self to christen the Stanford stadium
with a liberal downpour of rain, or even
with scattered showers, on November
19, the day of the Big Game, he will be
acting in the face of precedent.
The weather man has calculated that
there is only one chance in ten that it
will rain on that day. Records for the
past twenty years show that rain has
only fallen twice on the day of Novcm
her 19 in the two decades. Of those two
times, only once did the moisture de
scend from the heavens during the hours
in which the football game is played.
