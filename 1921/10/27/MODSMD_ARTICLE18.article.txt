# CHINA IS STORM CENTER, THINKS CHESTER ROWELL
## Pessimistic View of Chaos in World Affairs Sounded in Talk 
### 
"The Pacific Problem is China," said Chester Howell, in his talk last night
in the Little Theatre, on "Japan and the United States on Disarmament."
"If there were no China, there would be no Pacific problem," he continued.
A large crowd attended the lecture, which was given under the auspices of
the World Problems Forum of the local Y. M. C. A.
China is a country of "tremendous opportunities, and terrible helplessness,"
said Howell, "fhina has opportunities and possessions beyond all limit, but is
helpless—it is in the industrial middle-ages; has no transportation, and its
government is mentally helpless."
Japan has come on the colonial stage rather late and has to take the
consequences," continued Howell, explaining Japan's problem of expansion.
"For the last generation and a half the Japanese babies have been born at the
Oriental rate and have died at the Occidental rate, due to the introduction
of modern science and sanitation. Japan must expand horizontally—acquire
territory; or expand vertically—make itself an industrialized nation."
The first way is difficult,' Howell pointed out, because "the Japanese, un
like the Chinese, can not adapt themselves to changes of climate. The

Japanese need a certain sort of cli
mate and the white man has that cli
mate and will not let them in. Sur
rounding the Pacific are territories
occupied by white races that speak
English. These are the natural places
for the Japanese to go, but the Eng
lish-speaking peoples say with accord,
'Thou shalt not.' "
"Right or wrong, wise or foolish,
it is the instinct of the English-speak
ing white man to hold his territory
for his race. There are no three na
tions bound closer together by ties of
historical friendship than the United
States, England and Japan; but, never
theless, the peoples of the first two do
not get along with those of the third.
To (keep the nations together, the
peoples must be kept apart."
If Japan is to make an industrial
nation, like England, out of itself, it
must get the raw materials from
China, liowell pointed out. "The
Japanese can not find new places to
live in China," he went on, "be
cause there are already four hundred
million people there now, and if the
country was improved to support
eight hundred million, there would be
nine hundred million there at once.
They wouldn't have to be born; they
are already born —they just wouldn't
die so fast. But Japan can industri
ally exploit Japan.
"Why not? It will help both China
and Japan, so the Japanese say, and
will not harm us. But we have al
ways insisted on the 'Open Door.' "
The 'Open Door," Rowell explained,
is a very good policy, but there is
no "Open Door" if there is no one to
keep it open—and China can not do
it. This leads up directly to the ques
tion of disarmament which is to be
.liscussed at the coming Washington
conference.
"Nine-tenths of all our national
taxes go to pay for past, present and
future wars," declared Rowell. "No
thing can be done in the question of
taxation to relieve the situation un
less it is done on the military end."
Referring to the present ship-buihling
race in the naval armament, he said,
"we can stand it, but Japan can't.
"There are an sorts of people in
Japan, but there is only one kind that
counts —the kind that controls the
government. The liberal movement
is an important part of Japan's life
and thought, but not of Japan's gov
ernment. The purpose of Japanese
education is to teach "loyalty to the
emperor." The head of the Japanese
delegation to the disarmament con
ference, Prince Tokogawa, is the head
of the deposed dynasty in Japan."
Speaking of the individualities of
the Chinese and Japanese, Rowell
said, "We are apt to judge the China
man by his best and the Jap by his
worst. The Chinaman will keep his
contracts and pay his debts—he is
honest in that restricted and narrow
sense; but we forget that the Japan
ese government is honest, and the
Chinese government is not. China
may belong to the Chinese, but the
Chinese don't know it. They don't
know what the word 'nation' means.'"
"I am frankly pessimistic," Rowell
said in conclusion, speaking of the
Pacific problems which the coming
conference must face. "I am a pessi
mistic about the stamina of the
American people to see it through,
pessimistic about getting an agree
ment with Japan. But the case is so
desperate," he continued, wtili refer
ence especially to European chaos,
"that something must come out of it.
Europe is bankrupt, in economic chaos.
It is a situation that could not be
worse. Civilization can not stand
under it unless something is done.
If the right thing is not done, the
world will pay, and pay, and pay."
The lecture was the second of a
series being given this quarter, under
the auspices of the World Problems
Forum of the Y. M. C. A. The date
and subject of the next talk will be
announced next week.

it is the instinct of the English-speak
ing white man to hold his territory
for his race. There are no three na
tions bound closer together by ties of
historical friendship than the United
States, England and Japan; but, never
theless, the peoples of the first two do
not get along with those of the third.
To (keep the nations together, the
peoples must be kept apart."
If Japan is to make an industrial
nation, like England, out of itself, it
must get the raw materials from
China, liowell pointed out. "The
Japanese can not find new places to
live in China," he went on, "be
cause there are already four hundred
million people there now, and if the
country was improved to support
eight hundred million, there would be
nine hundred million there at once.
They wouldn't have to be born; they
are already born —they just wouldn't
die so fast. But Japan can industri
ally exploit Japan.
"Why not? It will help both China
and Japan, so the Japanese say, and
will not harm us. But we have al
ways insisted on the 'Open Door.' "
The 'Open Door," Rowell explained,
is a very good policy, but there is
no "Open Door" if there is no one to
keep it open—and China can not do
it. This leads up directly to the ques
tion of disarmament which is to be
.liscussed at the coming Washington
conference.
"Nine-tenths of all our national
taxes go to pay for past, present and
future wars," declared Rowell. "No
thing can be done in the question of
taxation to relieve the situation un
less it is done on the military end."
Referring to the present ship-buihling
race in the naval armament, he said,
"we can stand it, but Japan can't.
"There are an sorts of people in
Japan, but there is only one kind that
counts —the kind that controls the
government. The liberal movement
is an important part of Japan's life
and thought, but not of Japan's gov
ernment. The purpose of Japanese
education is to teach "loyalty to the
emperor." The head of the Japanese
delegation to the disarmament con
ference, Prince Tokogawa, is the head
of the deposed dynasty in Japan."
Speaking of the individualities of
the Chinese and Japanese, Rowell
said, "We are apt to judge the China
man by his best and the Jap by his
worst. The Chinaman will keep his
contracts and pay his debts—he is
honest in that restricted and narrow
sense; but we forget that the Japan
ese government is honest, and the
Chinese government is not. China
may belong to the Chinese, but the
Chinese don't know it. They don't
know what the word 'nation' means.'"
"I am frankly pessimistic," Rowell
said in conclusion, speaking of the
Pacific problems which the coming
conference must face. "I am a pessi
mistic about the stamina of the
American people to see it through,
pessimistic about getting an agree
ment with Japan. But the case is so
desperate," he continued, wtili refer
ence especially to European chaos,
"that something must come out of it.
Europe is bankrupt, in economic chaos.
It is a situation that could not be
worse. Civilization can not stand
under it unless something is done.
If the right thing is not done, the
world will pay, and pay, and pay."
The lecture was the second of a
series being given this quarter, under
the auspices of the World Problems
Forum of the Y. M. C. A. The date
and subject of the next talk will be
announced next week.
"The Pacific Problem is China," said Chester Howell, in his talk last night
in the Little Theatre, on "Japan and the United States on Disarmament."
"If there were no China, there would be no Pacific problem," he continued.
A large crowd attended the lecture, which was given under the auspices of
the World Problems Forum of the local Y. M. C. A.
China is a country of "tremendous opportunities, and terrible helplessness,"
said Howell, "fhina has opportunities and possessions beyond all limit, but is
helpless—it is in the industrial middle-ages; has no transportation, and its
government is mentally helpless."
Japan has come on the colonial stage rather late and has to take the
consequences," continued Howell, explaining Japan's problem of expansion.
"For the last generation and a half the Japanese babies have been born at the
Oriental rate and have died at the Occidental rate, due to the introduction
of modern science and sanitation. Japan must expand horizontally—acquire
territory; or expand vertically—make itself an industrialized nation."
The first way is difficult,' Howell pointed out, because "the Japanese, un
like the Chinese, can not adapt themselves to changes of climate. The

Japanese need a certain sort of cli
mate and the white man has that cli
mate and will not let them in. Sur
rounding the Pacific are territories
occupied by white races that speak
English. These are the natural places
for the Japanese to go, but the Eng
lish-speaking peoples say with accord,
'Thou shalt not.' "

future wars," declared Rowell. "No
thing can be done in the question of
taxation to relieve the situation un
less it is done on the military end."
Referring to the present ship-buihling
race in the naval armament, he said,
"we can stand it, but Japan can't.
"There are an sorts of people in
Japan, but there is only one kind that
counts —the kind that controls the
government. The liberal movement
is an important part of Japan's life
and thought, but not of Japan's gov
ernment. The purpose of Japanese
education is to teach "loyalty to the
emperor." The head of the Japanese
delegation to the disarmament con
ference, Prince Tokogawa, is the head
of the deposed dynasty in Japan."
Speaking of the individualities of
the Chinese and Japanese, Rowell
said, "We are apt to judge the China
man by his best and the Jap by his
worst. The Chinaman will keep his
contracts and pay his debts—he is
honest in that restricted and narrow
sense; but we forget that the Japan
ese government is honest, and the
Chinese government is not. China
may belong to the Chinese, but the
Chinese don't know it. They don't
know what the word 'nation' means.'"
"I am frankly pessimistic," Rowell
said in conclusion, speaking of the
Pacific problems which the coming
conference must face. "I am a pessi
mistic about the stamina of the
American people to see it through,
pessimistic about getting an agree
ment with Japan. But the case is so
desperate," he continued, wtili refer
ence especially to European chaos,
"that something must come out of it.
Europe is bankrupt, in economic chaos.
It is a situation that could not be
worse. Civilization can not stand
under it unless something is done.
If the right thing is not done, the
world will pay, and pay, and pay."
The lecture was the second of a
series being given this quarter, under
the auspices of the World Problems
Forum of the Y. M. C. A. The date
and subject of the next talk will be
announced next week.
