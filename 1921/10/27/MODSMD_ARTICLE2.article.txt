the four teams drill in crowding op
ponents off the ball, and in offensive
formation about the goal.
Tomorrow the second match of the
fall quarter series will he played, when
the Whites meet the Browns, and the
Reds play the Blues. The White team,

representing Stanford in outside meets,
has a handicap of 13, while the Browns
are given 2. The Red team, which in
cludes Major Collins and Captain Boyle,
