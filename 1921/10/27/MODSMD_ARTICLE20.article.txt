# True Stanford Spirit.

### 
"A spirit that goes beyond cheering, that is willing
to make sacrifices for the players, is what is needed.
There are chances for every one to help the team
every day in the week in addition to supporting it in
the bleachers."
When Coach Gene Van Gent made the above
statement at the football rally last week we wonder
if lie realized that he was appealing to the true
Stanford Spirit. A great deal has been written
about this unusual college spirit which is manifested
in Stanford University perhaps more than in any
other institution of learning in the West. When
Stanford teams are victorious it is attributed to
Stanford spirit. When Stanford teams are beaten
the feature of the contest is always the display of
spirit on the part of the supporters as well as of the
team itself.
Stanford spirit is no more than the spirit of
cooperation. Cooperation is such a large factor
because it is prompted by the love which students
bear toward Stanford and the desire to preserve and
increase its glory.
Van Gent appeals to this Stanford spirit of
cooperation. Stanford is small enough so that
iber of the student body knows practically
;r member, by sight at least. Usually we
Â»ted in the same things and therefore know
the principal participants in each activity. Because
classes are small it is possible to know what the
leaders in activities are doing scholastically. Per
haps there are a few football players in one of your
classes. While they are giving so much of their
time, brains, and brawn to the building of victorious
athletic teams they are in danger of losing some of
the thing they come to Stanford for: that is,
knowledge.
A manifestation of the true Stanford spirit would
be to go to the members of athletic teams whom you
know are having trouble with their studies and offer
to assist them. The sacrifice on your part would
be very small while your aid to them would be
invaluable perhaps. In this connection men who
are out for athletics should not be afraid to ask help
from those whom they know are doing well in the
course.
In this way some of the severe mental strain
which men in athletics labor under may be shared by
those whose sole participation in activities may be in
watching the contests from the bleachers.
