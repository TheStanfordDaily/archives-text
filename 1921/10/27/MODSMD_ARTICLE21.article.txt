# Up to the Yell Leaders.

### 
Sale of seats in both the men's and women's
rooting sections indicates that Stanford will have
one of the largest bleacher turnouts it has ever had
for the coming Big Game. The issue is now placed
squarely up to the Yell Leader and his assistants.
Almost two thousand students have signified their
intention of being part of the Big Game spectacle.
The material for the show will be on hand; it is up
to those in charge to see that it is properly trained
and rehearsed.
Sixty thousand people will be watching Stanford
students on November 19. They will marvel at the
stadium which has sprung from the earth in the
short space of six months. While marveling at
Stanford's enterprise they will he effusive in their
prai ses. Will they commend the Stanford bleacher
display on that day? Whether they do or not is
entirely in the hands of three men, the Yell Leader
and his two assistants.
The duties of the students do not end with the
purchase of seats in the rooting sections. They
will he called u|>on many times within the few days
that remain before the event of the year to attend
rallies and practices. Unless they do respond, the
Big Game stunts will not be successful despite the
presence of every available student. But if they do
respond, the whole responsibility for the success of
the Stanford section will fall upon the conductors of
1 ho rooting forces.
Thus it is still a problem of securing cooperation.

The students have signified their willingness to par
ticipate. They now await the call of those in
charge to begin active preparations.
