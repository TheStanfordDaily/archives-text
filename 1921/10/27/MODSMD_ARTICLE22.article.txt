THE LAST BAWL-OUT
Here's what we get for throwing open the colyuru to
the heartless public. One would think this were "An
other Viewpoint" space, judging by recent caustic com
munications.

Dear Edgitor: —
When I survey your new Cabbage Garden, I come to
the sad conclusion that it is cluttered and smothered
with weeds —stink-weeds, at that. I would suggest that
you change your crew of train conductors for a gang of
gardeners. You are getting derailed too much of the
time. You might keep the fireman. Perhaps he has
learned to use a shovel well enough to turn over a few
clods now and then. But then, you will all be firemen
by and by if you keep up serving such portions of Cab
bage and.
You wanted contributions. This is one. You probably
believe that this is like a button on the church collec
tion plate, or a lead-nickel in the blind man's cup, but
Powell street has nothing on the D. P. A. office for sight
seeing. Take all those Roble dolls, for instance. No
wonder the editor forgets about the Cabbage.
Speaking about cabbages, perhaps it would be well to
accumulate a reserve stock to issue to these unfortun
ates who wear blue socks and yellow neckties. After
we take away their money from them, when they be
lieved they were bettrlig on a sure thing, corn beef and
the renowned vegetable will seem a palatial dish to their
unburdened pocketbooks.
The succulent vegetable might be put up behind glass
as an exhibit and presented to the anatomical depart
ment as a new species of cranium brought into promi
nence by the Big Game.
* * *
It now comes to light that Cal's
hymn is lifted from the old national
anthem of Imperial Russia. Well,
Reds polished off the Russian Bear.
* * *
A SILENT TEA
A young man who queened with eclat
Had a habit of langhing, "Hat, Hat!"
The maiden so fair,
Gave the laughter the air,
And went away singing, "Trat, Lat!"
* * *
Question: —If it takes two men and a boy three weeks
to teach a clam to walk backwards, how far can a mule
jump with his tail tied to a telegraph pole?
Answer:—The length of his tail.
* * *
Don't Strike Me!
As the king-pin said to the bowler, "Spare Me."
Having civilized the Barbarians, it is up to somebody
to make the Aggies look like farmers.
♦ ♦ *
"C" that man, California, he's an athlete!
♦ * *
Dear Head of Cabbage:—Some Smart-Aleck who thinks
he's a Cabbage King wants to know is this coluym is
run like a baseball park, in that Thursday is Ladies'
Day?
* * *
I need only say in reply, both politely and dignifiedly,
that they're entiled to some space in this colyum be
cause they're part of the Farm and who is to do it?
We can't expect too much from Carl, he's too intellec
tual; Hal is so good-looking he doesn't have to write
about 'em to attract attention; Phil, well, he's young
yet. As for Tom, "time and tide" might say a lot but
he signs my checks now so I better key down.
* * *
Therefore, being the nearest to a bachelor's degree,
and nearly old enough to be a grandfather, I offer the
following on how to be naughty and yet be nice, which,
considering the mush, is about as good as its title:
* * #
Home Brew
"Give me a kiss, coquettish miss?" —
Her look was cold and hard —
"The reason why? Our country's dry,
Intoxicants are barred."
"A couple sips from honeyed lips,
Are drinks, but "hard" they're not,
Except to get, and they, I'll bet,
Are best that can be got."
"Then kiss my cheek," she murmured meek.
"I hope 'twill do instead;
Lip-kissing's wrong—your nose so long,
Would make them 'turn your head.' "
But there'll be soon a honeymoon.
We'll wed without delay;
She told me ta, because she knew,
Home liquors are O. K.
» * *
Friends up at Cal (key down, will you) say that,
properly speaking, the new Stanford Stadium is not a
bowl, but a horseshoe, because of the open end. Now
that's funny, isn't it? It might be a horseshoe to Stan
ford, but it'll never be to Cal.
* * ♦
Bughouse Fables
"That last suit of yours just wore and wore, didn't it?"
"Sure, I bought it during the wore."
* * ♦
But, just to demonstrate for purely scientific pur
poses, that a pun couldn't be even worse, take this:
News Edtior: Five is a basketball team, seven a
woman's basketball team, eight in crew, nine a baseball
team, eleven a football team.
Head Writer: Tardon me, you skipped one. Tell me
what Tennis?
♦ * •
No wonder Moses was down the cellar eating sauer
kraut. Could cabbages be worse?
* * •
Fifty million a year for hair-nets! Aren't there any
more gentlemen left in the world?

he's a Cabbage King wants to know is this coluym is

I need only say in reply, both politely and dignifiedly,

We can't expect too much from Carl, he's too intellec

about 'em to attract attention; Phil, well, he's young
yet. As for Tom, "time and tide" might say a lot but
he signs my checks now so I better key down.

Therefore, being the nearest to a bachelor's degree,
and nearly old enough to be a grandfather, I offer the
following on how to be naughty and yet be nice, which,
considering the mush, is about as good as its title:

Home Brew
"Give me a kiss, coquettish miss?" —
Her look was cold and hard —
"The reason why? Our country's dry,
Intoxicants are barred."
"A couple sips from honeyed lips,
Are drinks, but "hard" they're not,
Except to get, and they, I'll bet,
Are best that can be got."
"Then kiss my cheek," she murmured meek.
"I hope 'twill do instead;
Lip-kissing's wrong—your nose so long,
Would make them 'turn your head.' "
But there'll be soon a honeymoon.
We'll wed without delay;
She told me ta, because she knew,
Home liquors are O. K.

Friends up at Cal (key down, will you) say that,

THE LAST BAWL-OUT
Here's what we get for throwing open the colyuru to
the heartless public. One would think this were "An
other Viewpoint" space, judging by recent caustic com

Dear Edgitor: —
When I survey your new Cabbage Garden, I come to
the sad conclusion that it is cluttered and smothered
with weeds —stink-weeds, at that. I would suggest that
you change your crew of train conductors for a gang of
gardeners. You are getting derailed too much of the
time. You might keep the fireman. Perhaps he has
learned to use a shovel well enough to turn over a few
clods now and then. But then, you will all be firemen
by and by if you keep up serving such portions of Cab
bage and.
You wanted contributions. This is one. You probably
believe that this is like a button on the church collec
tion plate, or a lead-nickel in the blind man's cup, but
Powell street has nothing on the D. P. A. office for sight
seeing. Take all those Roble dolls, for instance. No
wonder the editor forgets about the Cabbage.
Speaking about cabbages, perhaps it would be well to
accumulate a reserve stock to issue to these unfortun
ates who wear blue socks and yellow neckties. After
we take away their money from them, when they be
lieved they were bettrlig on a sure thing, corn beef and
the renowned vegetable will seem a palatial dish to their
unburdened pocketbooks.
The succulent vegetable might be put up behind glass
as an exhibit and presented to the anatomical depart
ment as a new species of cranium brought into promi
nence by the Big Game.
* * *
It now comes to light that Cal's
hymn is lifted from the old national
anthem of Imperial Russia. Well,
Reds polished off the Russian Bear.

THE LAST BAWL-OUT
Here's what we get for throwing open the colyuru to
the heartless public. One would think this were "An
other Viewpoint" space, judging by recent caustic com
munications.

Dear Edgitor: —
When I survey your new Cabbage Garden, I come to
the sad conclusion that it is cluttered and smothered
with weeds —stink-weeds, at that. I would suggest that
you change your crew of train conductors for a gang of
gardeners. You are getting derailed too much of the
time. You might keep the fireman. Perhaps he has
learned to use a shovel well enough to turn over a few
clods now and then. But then, you will all be firemen
by and by if you keep up serving such portions of Cab
bage and.
You wanted contributions. This is one. You probably
believe that this is like a button on the church collec
tion plate, or a lead-nickel in the blind man's cup, but
Powell street has nothing on the D. P. A. office for sight
seeing. Take all those Roble dolls, for instance. No
wonder the editor forgets about the Cabbage.
Speaking about cabbages, perhaps it would be well to
accumulate a reserve stock to issue to these unfortun
ates who wear blue socks and yellow neckties. After
we take away their money from them, when they be
lieved they were bettrlig on a sure thing, corn beef and
the renowned vegetable will seem a palatial dish to their
unburdened pocketbooks.
The succulent vegetable might be put up behind glass
as an exhibit and presented to the anatomical depart
ment as a new species of cranium brought into promi
nence by the Big Game.
* * *
It now comes to light that Cal's
hymn is lifted from the old national
anthem of Imperial Russia. Well,
Reds polished off the Russian Bear.
* * *
A SILENT TEA
A young man who queened with eclat
Had a habit of langhing, "Hat, Hat!"
The maiden so fair,
Gave the laughter the air,
And went away singing, "Trat, Lat!"
* * *
Question: —If it takes two men and a boy three weeks
to teach a clam to walk backwards, how far can a mule
jump with his tail tied to a telegraph pole?
Answer:—The length of his tail.
* * *
Don't Strike Me!
As the king-pin said to the bowler, "Spare Me."
Having civilized the Barbarians, it is up to somebody
to make the Aggies look like farmers.
♦ ♦ *
"C" that man, California, he's an athlete!
♦ * *
Dear Head of Cabbage:—Some Smart-Aleck who thinks
he's a Cabbage King wants to know is this coluym is
run like a baseball park, in that Thursday is Ladies'
Day?
* * *
I need only say in reply, both politely and dignifiedly,
that they're entiled to some space in this colyum be
cause they're part of the Farm and who is to do it?
We can't expect too much from Carl, he's too intellec
tual; Hal is so good-looking he doesn't have to write
about 'em to attract attention; Phil, well, he's young
yet. As for Tom, "time and tide" might say a lot but
he signs my checks now so I better key down.
* * *
Therefore, being the nearest to a bachelor's degree,
and nearly old enough to be a grandfather, I offer the
following on how to be naughty and yet be nice, which,
considering the mush, is about as good as its title:
* * #
Home Brew
"Give me a kiss, coquettish miss?" —
Her look was cold and hard —
"The reason why? Our country's dry,
Intoxicants are barred."
"A couple sips from honeyed lips,
Are drinks, but "hard" they're not,
Except to get, and they, I'll bet,
Are best that can be got."
"Then kiss my cheek," she murmured meek.
"I hope 'twill do instead;
Lip-kissing's wrong—your nose so long,
Would make them 'turn your head.' "
But there'll be soon a honeymoon.
We'll wed without delay;
She told me ta, because she knew,
Home liquors are O. K.
» * *
Friends up at Cal (key down, will you) say that,
properly speaking, the new Stanford Stadium is not a
bowl, but a horseshoe, because of the open end. Now
that's funny, isn't it? It might be a horseshoe to Stan
ford, but it'll never be to Cal.
* * ♦
Bughouse Fables
"That last suit of yours just wore and wore, didn't it?"
"Sure, I bought it during the wore."
* * ♦
But, just to demonstrate for purely scientific pur
poses, that a pun couldn't be even worse, take this:
News Edtior: Five is a basketball team, seven a
woman's basketball team, eight in crew, nine a baseball
team, eleven a football team.
Head Writer: Tardon me, you skipped one. Tell me
what Tennis?
♦ * •
No wonder Moses was down the cellar eating sauer
kraut. Could cabbages be worse?
* * •
Fifty million a year for hair-nets! Aren't there any
more gentlemen left in the world?

"OH, AY SEE WHO'LL WIN," SAID THE SWEDE:
