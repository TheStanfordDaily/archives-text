# PROGRAM TO FEATURE MEETING OF Y. M. C. A.
## 
### 
The entire membership of the local
Y. M. C. A. will gather tonight in the
Union for the first meeting of the quar
ter, which will be in the nature of a
stag.
Various stunts and entertainments
have been arranged for by "Doug" Mc-
Kinnon, chairman of the committee on
arrangements. Jack Hefferman will be
among the star performers, and other
numbers on the bill, which have not yet
been revealed, will complete the pro
gram. The stag will start at 7:30 and
be over by 9 o'clock.
This is the first meeting of the entire
membership to be held so far this year,
and present plans indicate that there
will be one such meeting each quarter.
New members of the "Y" are especially
invited to come tonight to take advan
tage of the chance to get acquainted.
Mark Evans, '20, will speak on "Minor
Sports."
