# Y.W.C.A. ENLARGES SCOPE OF WORK DURING PAST YEAR
## Resume of Activities of Local Association Shows Marked Extension and Interest 
### 
The securing of a permanent club
room for the Girls' Reserve Club of
Palo Alto, by the Stanford Y. W. C. A.,
is the latest indication of the increasing
scope and value of the work of that or
ganization.
A resume of the work done by the
local Y. W. .C. A, last year and which
will be continued on even a larger scale
this year, shows that besides the va
rious activities which the women have
sponsored on the campus, girls' club and
social service work has also covered the
surrounding neighborhoods of Palo
Alto, Redwood City and Mayfield. It is
the aim of the Y. W. C. -A. to be rep
resented by every woman in the Uni
versity and to make each woman one of
a working unit. The Y. VV. cabinet,
which is advised by the general secre
tary, Miss Margaret Woolsey, is com
posed of the chairmen of the various
committees which carry on the work of
the organization. This cabinet confers
weekly and passes its decision on to
the committees.
One of the off-campus activities which
has brought the Y. W. considerable
notice and praise is that accomplished
by the girls' work committee. During
last year six girls' clubs were formed in
Palo Alto, two in Redwood City and
one in Mayfield, with Stanford women
as directors. The Girls' Reserve, as they
arc officially called, include girls from
twelve to eighteen years old in grade or
high schools or in business. In these
clubs the girls do various forms of so
cial scrvice work, such as making scrap
books for the children's hospital, as well
as putting on plays and going on hikes
or participating in other outdoor sports.
The Mayfield group has a clubroom and
runs a circulating library among them
selves. The work not only offers an
opportunity to he of service to the girls
but is also an excellent training ground
for teachers or other women whose vo
cation will bring them in contact with
younger girls.
The scope of the Y. W. Social Service
work was materially enlarged last year
when a club for little girls was formed
at Five Points, a Spanish settlement
near Redwood City. The children there
were practically neglected until the club
formed by the Social Scrvicc committee
gave them hygienic instruction, small
tasks and supervised recreation.
Dresses were made for the children at
the Stanford Convalescent Home, and
the committee arranged for students to
visit the home every afternoon. The
Rase Hospital also received attention
when thirty dollars was raised at a
candy sale to buy books which the men
desired. In addition magazines were
collected from the campus living groups
and sent to the men twice a week, and
musical programs by campus talent were
arranged once a month.
The strictly campus work is cared for
by the meetings and social committees.
The former arranges the regular meet
ings of the association and selects the
various speakers, while the latter takes
care of the purely social functions and
sees that all of the women become ac
quainted through picnic suppers and
general get-together parties.
The membership committee fullfils it
its name by circulating membership
cards among all of the women, and a
publicity committee keeps the campus
informed on the activities of the or
ganization, as well as keeping a bulletin
board of current news in the restroom in
the English building. A general confer
ence of all the associations is held at
Asilomar every year at the close of
college and a conference committee at
tends to all of the arrangements and
information desired locally.
Linking the work of the campus or
ganization with that of the National
Y. W. C. A., is the office of undergrad
uate field representative whose duty is
to keep in touch and acquaint the local
workers with all national movements of
importance in order to promote a clearer
relationship between the two.

when a club for little girls was formed
at Five Points, a Spanish settlement
near Redwood City. The children there
were practically neglected until the club
formed by the Social Scrvicc committee
gave them hygienic instruction, small
tasks and supervised recreation.
Dresses were made for the children at
the Stanford Convalescent Home, and
the committee arranged for students to
visit the home every afternoon. The
Rase Hospital also received attention
when thirty dollars was raised at a
candy sale to buy books which the men
desired. In addition magazines were
collected from the campus living groups
and sent to the men twice a week, and
musical programs by campus talent were
arranged once a month.
The strictly campus work is cared for
by the meetings and social committees.
The former arranges the regular meet
ings of the association and selects the
various speakers, while the latter takes
care of the purely social functions and
sees that all of the women become ac
quainted through picnic suppers and
general get-together parties.
The membership committee fullfils it
its name by circulating membership
cards among all of the women, and a
publicity committee keeps the campus
informed on the activities of the or
ganization, as well as keeping a bulletin
board of current news in the restroom in
the English building. A general confer
ence of all the associations is held at
Asilomar every year at the close of
college and a conference committee at
tends to all of the arrangements and
information desired locally.
Linking the work of the campus or
ganization with that of the National
Y. W. C. A., is the office of undergrad
uate field representative whose duty is
to keep in touch and acquaint the local
workers with all national movements of
importance in order to promote a clearer
relationship between the two.
The securing of a permanent club
room for the Girls' Reserve Club of
Palo Alto, by the Stanford Y. W. C. A.,
is the latest indication of the increasing
scope and value of the work of that or
ganization.
A resume of the work done by the
local Y. W. .C. A, last year and which
will be continued on even a larger scale
this year, shows that besides the va
rious activities which the women have
sponsored on the campus, girls' club and
social service work has also covered the
surrounding neighborhoods of Palo
Alto, Redwood City and Mayfield. It is
the aim of the Y. W. C. -A. to be rep
resented by every woman in the Uni
versity and to make each woman one of
a working unit. The Y. VV. cabinet,
which is advised by the general secre
tary, Miss Margaret Woolsey, is com
posed of the chairmen of the various
committees which carry on the work of
the organization. This cabinet confers
weekly and passes its decision on to
the committees.
One of the off-campus activities which
has brought the Y. W. considerable
notice and praise is that accomplished
by the girls' work committee. During
last year six girls' clubs were formed in
Palo Alto, two in Redwood City and
one in Mayfield, with Stanford women
as directors. The Girls' Reserve, as they
arc officially called, include girls from
twelve to eighteen years old in grade or
high schools or in business. In these
clubs the girls do various forms of so
cial scrvice work, such as making scrap
books for the children's hospital, as well
as putting on plays and going on hikes
or participating in other outdoor sports.
The Mayfield group has a clubroom and
runs a circulating library among them
selves. The work not only offers an
opportunity to he of service to the girls
but is also an excellent training ground
for teachers or other women whose vo
cation will bring them in contact with
younger girls.
