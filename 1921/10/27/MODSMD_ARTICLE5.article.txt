# CHAPPIE'S FOOTBALL SHOW UNDER WAY
## Director Les Seib Issues Call for More Women Tryoutees Big Opportunities Offered 
### 
The second set of tryouts for the
Chappie football show were held this
afternoon and a large and representa
tive crowd of aspirants was present to
compete for places in the cast.
An opportunity will be given for those
who have missed the two previous try
outs but who are desirous of participat
ing in the performance, to demonstrate
their ability before Coach Lester Seib
in the Women's Clubhouse tonight from
7 until 9 o'clock. The final tryout will
be held Saturday morning from 9 until
12 o'clock in the Assembly Hall. The
director is offering this last opportunity
to those who have missed the previous
meetings, as he is especially anxious to
secure as large and as representative
a group of tryoutees as is possible. How
ever, this is positively the final chance
that will be allowed, and for that rea
son men and women who contemplate
trying out are urged not to delay report
ing to Coach Seib later than Saturday
morning.
Women especially are requested to
come out and take part in the show.
Letters have been dispatched to all
women's living groups on the campus
soliciting their support in putting the
production over. The feminine roles in
the piece offer splendid and exceptional
opportunities to campus women, and
many of the leads will be placed in their
hands. It is expected that through this
medium a number of co-eds will be ele
vated to stardom and dramatic fame.
This is proved by the fact that Theta
Sigma Phi, women's honorary journal
istic fraternity, has prepared a red-hot
skit, the essence of which will be a
"razz" on the famous Stanford man.
The Chappies have derived a great deal
of fun and material for a long time by
the simple expedient of poking fun at
the "500." For this the women are fully
determined to have revenge. With this
end in view, the "journalettes" have
crammed their work full of biting sar
casm—more or less deserved—which
they intend to heap on the heads of the
"mere Stanford males."
On the other hand, the Chappies, con
tent with their "mud-slinging" in the
past, will not attempt retaliation in their
performance and the co-eds may rest
secure that they will neither be defamed
nor ridiculed in the Chappie show.
