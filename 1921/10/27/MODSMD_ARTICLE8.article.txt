Captain Jack Patrick, Wilcox, Shlaude
man, De Groot, Betts, Pershing, llclser,

It is believed that Saturday's fracas
with the "fighting" Oregon Aggies on
the Stanford turf will result in the best
game of the season.
Coach Rutherford of the northern
team will bring to the campus the
strongest outfit that has represented the

Aggies for several years. He has on
his squad eleven letter men besides nu
merous stars from a strong freshmen
team of last year.
Stanford did not play O. A. C. last
year but California went to Corvallisand
barely managed to squeeze out a win in
the last half. The Aggies were one of
the two teams to score on the Bears last
season.
Coach Rutherford has practically his
entire team back, and word comes from
the north that he is figuring to clean up
the conference this year.
"Shy" Huntington, of the University
of Oregon, thought the same thing un
til Stanford outgamed his team about
this time last year, 10 to 0.
Van Gent had his men going through
a fast pace last night in sccrct. Football
fans are figuring that the Cards will use
something besides straight football Sat
urday. It was demonstrated that Van
Gent's men have a powerful aerial of
fense against the Pacific Fleet when
they worked three straight forward
passes in a row and brought the ball in


CAPTAIN JACK PATRICK, '21
Whose work at Fullback on the
Cardinal Varsity has been
brilliant this season.
