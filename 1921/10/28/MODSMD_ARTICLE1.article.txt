# SWORD AND SANDALS PLAY HOLDS CAMPUS ATTENTION TONIGHT
## "Tailor-Made Man" Has Reputation Of Being Good Entertainment By Means of Straight Comedy Theme 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
"For sheer entertainment, no better
show could have been chosen for cam
pus production than the 'Tailor-Made
man,' " Coach Gordon said last even
ing, at the final dress rehearsal.
With the stellar cast, Sword and
Sandals has gotten for this comedy to
put it over with the stage effects we
have obtained, it will doubtless be one
of the biggest successes of the year.
As one of the characters is made
to remark, it is not too uplifting to
be uncomfortable. Although there is
a serious basic principle of economics
at the bottom of the plot, the comedy
is emphasized. The idea was first
presented in a Hungarian comedy and
retains much of its original portent
even after the Cohen-Smith revision.
This feature tends to keep the farcical
idea sufficiently subordinated."
Lots of the old stars and several
new ones are included in the year's
first cast. Les Seib, Dorothy Wood
head, Paul Claflin, A. D. Cohan, Fred
Hughes, Augusta Corey, and Margaret

Howard, have parts. Besides these,
Cecil Morris, Mildred Finley, Kath
leen Evans and Mabel Ferry will ap
pear for the first time in important
parts.
Dorothy Woodhead plays the wom
an's lead, Tanya Huber, the sweet,
ingenuous daughter of a small tailor.
The part in itself is rather blank and
colorless. For this reason it seemed
difficult, but Miss Woodhead has
livened it up and given Tanya a real
character.
Opposite Tanya is Les Seib playing
John Paul Bart, his last appearance
after three years of success. Bart is
the tailor-made man and upon his
action most of the show hinges. Bart
represents a personality which has
taken another man's idea and a sec
ond one's dress-suit and has put itself
over. He reads the manuscript of his

rival's book and appropriates the
ideas. To get into influential circles
where these ideas will count, he
steals a dress-suit which has been
sent to the tailor's for pressing and
breaks into a big reception.
Cecil Morris, who does some of the
best character work in the show,
plays the wrathful and expressive
German tailor, Huber. His dialect is
as Deutch sounding as the motto on
an ancient stein. Besides this, his
pantomine is as good as the most in
telligent campus actor's.
Mr. Jellicot, the English society
hound, insists that there is nothing
clever in his part but the situation
and his clothes, but it is safe to put
a considerable portion of the blame
for some of the evening's best comedy
on Claflin's skill. It is his dress-suit
that is stolen by Bart and he appears
in a rangy make-shift which takes a
good deal of attention lest it fall in a
hopeless tangle.
A. I). Cohen has another of the dia
lects, a braw scotch, to take care of.
He takes the part of Peter MacConkie,
the tailor's assistant. Peter's charac
teristic is knowing his exact duty and
doing it —exactly.
Mildred Finley, a returning student,
makes her bow as the polite widow,
Mrs, Kitty DuPuy. (Her acting ids
about the best that the campus will
see for some time. She is master of
every situation with her dignified
poise and is the possessor of a rich,
thrilling voice. Most of her spare
time is spent in telling little daughter
what to say. Little daughter is meek
ly and effectively played by* Kathleen
Evans.
