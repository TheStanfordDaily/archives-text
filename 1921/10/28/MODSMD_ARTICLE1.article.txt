# SWORD AND SANDALS PLAY HOLDS CAMPUS ATTENTION TONIGHT
## "Tailor-Made Man" Has Reputation Of Being Good Entertainment By Means of Straight Comedy Theme 
### H. B. Rorke, '24 
"For sheer entertainment, no better
show could have been chosen for cam
pus production than the 'Tailor-Made
man,' " Coach Gordon said last even
ing, at the final dress rehearsal.
With the stellar cast, Sword and
Sandals has gotten for this comedy to
put it over with the stage effects we
have obtained, it will doubtless be one
of the biggest successes of the year.
As one of the characters is made
to remark, it is not too uplifting to
be uncomfortable. Although there is
a serious basic principle of economics
at the bottom of the plot, the comedy
is emphasized. The idea was first
presented in a Hungarian comedy and
retains much of its original portent
even after the Cohen-Smith revision.
This feature tends to keep the farcical
idea sufficiently subordinated."
Lots of the old stars and several
new ones are included in the year's
first cast. Les Seib, Dorothy Wood
head, Paul Claflin, A. D. Cohan, Fred
Hughes, Augusta Corey, and Margaret

Howard, have parts. Besides these,
Cecil Morris, Mildred Finley, Kath
leen Evans and Mabel Ferry will ap
pear for the first time in important
parts.
Dorothy Woodhead plays the wom
an's lead, Tanya Huber, the sweet,
ingenuous daughter of a small tailor.
The part in itself is rather blank and
colorless. For this reason it seemed
difficult, but Miss Woodhead has
livened it up and given Tanya a real
character.
Opposite Tanya is Les Seib playing
John Paul Bart, his last appearance
after three years of success. Bart is
the tailor-made man and upon his
action most of the show hinges. Bart
represents a personality which has
taken another man's idea and a sec
ond one's dress-suit and has put itself
over. He reads the manuscript of his

rival's book and appropriates the
ideas. To get into influential circles
where these ideas will count, he
steals a dress-suit which has been
sent to the tailor's for pressing and
breaks into a big reception.
Cecil Morris, who does some of the
best character work in the show,
plays the wrathful and expressive
German tailor, Huber. His dialect is
as Deutch sounding as the motto on
an ancient stein. Besides this, his
pantomine is as good as the most in
telligent campus actor's.
Mr. Jellicot, the English society
hound, insists that there is nothing
clever in his part but the situation
and his clothes, but it is safe to put
a considerable portion of the blame
for some of the evening's best comedy
on Claflin's skill. It is his dress-suit
that is stolen by Bart and he appears
in a rangy make-shift which takes a
good deal of attention lest it fall in a
hopeless tangle.
A. I). Cohen has another of the dia
lects, a braw scotch, to take care of.
He takes the part of Peter MacConkie,
the tailor's assistant. Peter's charac
teristic is knowing his exact duty and
doing it —exactly.
Mildred Finley, a returning student,
makes her bow as the polite widow,
Mrs, Kitty DuPuy. (Her acting ids
about the best that the campus will
see for some time. She is master of
every situation with her dignified
poise and is the possessor of a rich,
thrilling voice. Most of her spare
time is spent in telling little daughter
what to say. Little daughter is meek
ly and effectively played by* Kathleen
Evans.

Fred Hughes' song. His part, Pome
roy, is that of an English valet. It
is due to his information that the
tailor-made man takes the clothes and
the chance at fame, so though actually
responsible for a comparatively few
minutes of comedy the whole show
finds its cause in Pomeroy.
Mabel Ferry, who plays the part of
the terribly haughty heiress, claims
that contrary to announcement, the
terribly haughty heiress is no flapper.
She is at least an ingenue. Maybe,
for there is a finish and sureness about
her acting which could only be that
of an ingenue.
The third act is dominated by
Margaret Howard as efficiency plus,
the paramount stenographer. What
ever is done or is to be done she
anticipates. She has a good voice and
carriage as those who saAV her in
"Clarence" will remember, and gives
a finished performance.
A great deal of expense has been
incurred by the producers in the
scenery. There are three sets, and as
many chanty* oetween the four acts.
The effects are still realistic, but the
most elaborate one is that of the sec
ond act. Specially designed by Ed
Farmer, it reveals the reception room
of a million dollar home. Light gray
walls and tapestry hangings are
broken in the rear by a series of tall
arches and orange drapes. Behind
this leaded windows reveal a Maxfield
Parrish sky of ultramarine and spect
rum blue which blends into violet
overhead. The set has been splendid
ly furnished through the courtesy fo
the Palo AJto Furniture Company,
with the divan set, besides the piano
and other accessories.
An orchestra of seventeen pieces
will play until 8:15, when the curtain
will rise upon the tailor shop of
Anton Huber.
