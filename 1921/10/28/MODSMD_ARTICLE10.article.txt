# BABES TO BATTLE RIGHTER'S ELEVEN
## College of Pacific Has Team of Battlers; To Give Seay Proteges Stiff Opposition 
### 
Ihe Cardinal Babes will play their
toughest game tlius far this season when
they meet the College of the Pacific
elecen on the local field tomorrow after
noon just before the Varsity-O. A. C.
battle.
"Swede" Righter, Stanford four-let
ter man, and center on the varsity eleven
last year, is coaching the Orange and
Black gridmen, and according to dope
has built up one of the strongest foot
ball machines in the history of the col
lege.
Wednesday afternoon the yearlings
invaded the varsity field and played a
defensive scrimmage. At the outset they
were up against Van Cent's second
squad and were able to hold their own
fairly well. With the gradual change to
iirst squad men and a general tightening
of the play, the freshmen were at a loss
to prevent heavy yardage from being
piled up against them.
Cuddeback at full. Shipke at tackle,
and Moplofsky at center, showed up well
in the Wednesday night scrimmage.
Captain Dennis, Wheat and Gilliland are
playing strong games in the backfield.
Silver, a husky guard who has been 011
the hospital list for about three weeks
and got back into scrimmage for the
first time Monday, is a bulwark of
strength in the line.
Yesterday afternoon Coach Seay
talked to his proteges on the arts of
tackling, running interference and play
ing low on the defensive. The Babes
have been especially weak in tackling,
and the coaches have been putting most
of their efforts into the development of
this fundamental of play. Work of this
kind does not show results immediately,
and Coach Seay is proving his thorough
knowledge of football by drilling hard
and fast on the rudiments of the game.
Following an hour's workout on the
tackling dummy, the yearlnig first and
second lineups went into a short scrim
mage. From the way they worked, both
backfield and line, it is evident that the
freshmen have a strong team. Their
teamwork is not as smooth as it might
be, but they have a formidable line and
a heavy charging backfield.
Van Hook and Dole have been 011
the hospital list but it is probable that
Dole will be able to get into tomorrow's
battle. The probable lineup is: Janssen,
le; Shipke, It; Ncill, lg; Moplosky, c;
Silver, rg; Dole, rt; Fuller, re; Wheat,
r|h; Dennis and Gilliland, rhb; Cudde
back, fb.
