# VAN GENT FORCES IN FINE SHAPE FOR FIRST COAST CONFERENCE BATTLE
## Fighting Oregon Aggies, Rated As Best Eleven in Northwest, Arrive Confident of Victory 
### 
Gene Van Gent's Stanford varsity, tonight faces the critical period of the
season's football campaign.
The first game of the Pacific Coast conference season is before them.
Their opponents will be the "fighting" Oregon Aggies from Corvallis, so
named because of the sweeping manner that they have stormed all before
them this season.
The success of the season may depend greatly on the outcome of tomor
row's battle 011 the Stanford field.
Van Gent has his men primed for the fray. He has carefully safeguarded
his regulars for the Aggie contest. When the whistle sounds at 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon only one one first-string player, "Scotchy" Campbell' will
probably be on the sidelines.
Harley Carter, tackle, and Ray Doughty, halfback, are both ready to play.
They have recovered from injuries sustained against the Olympic Club two
weeks ago. Doughty may not start but he will be ready to enter the game
any time Van Gent vays the word.
The Aggies, headed by Coach Rutherford, have arrived. They will prob
ably stay in San Francisco tonight and come down just before the game to
morrow. The wily Oregon mentor is taking no chances. He believes that

he has a chance to win the confer
ence title and he knows that Stan
ford may he his stumbling block.
The Stanford coaches put their men
through a gruelling practice last night
that lasted until it was so dark that
the ball could scarcely be seen.
"Dink" Templeton lined his second
varsity up against the first-stringers,
and for nearly an hour had his men
call Aggie plays and formations. Only
once did the second varsity made a
substantial gain. That was when
Kraft, carrying the ball on a trick play
circled end without interference for
fifteen yards.
According to information from the
north the Aggies figure to beat Stan
ford at the open game. They attmpt
■ ed nineteen forward passes against
Washington and completed twelve, two
for touchdowns. For that reason the
seconds last night directed their of
fense chiefly in the aerial department.
If the Cardinals can break up the
Aggies' passing game it is believed
they can win tomorrow.
Light practice was on the bill for
tonight's workout. The varsity will
undoubtedly try new formations and
plays tomorrow. That was plainly
evident in Tuesday night's open prac
tice.
It is easier to pick the probable
starting line-up for the Cardinals to
morrow than it has been all year.
"Dud" DeGroot is nearly a certain
ty to open up at center. "Red" Betts
and Dick Faville are doped for the
guards, and Fred Ludeke and Harley
Carter, the tackles.
The ends are uncertain. "Shorty"
Mertz is a sure shot to start on the
left wing. "Kewp" Sproull and Dick
Pershing both look even to open up
at right end.
Doughty may start the game at right
half. It is probable, however, that
Van Gent will keep him out of the
game until some time during a critical
period. If he does not start, Wood
ward will play at quarter, Wilcox and
Shlaudeman at the halfs and Captain
Patrick at full. If Doughty is sent in
at the beginning, Shlaudeman will be
moved to quarter.
The Stanford-Aggie game will start
at 3 o'clock. Admission to those hold
ing student body cards will be $1.
General admission will be $1.50.
