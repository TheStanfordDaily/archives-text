# Watching Practice
## 
### 
Thursday will hereafter be designated as Bleacher
Day in the calendar of the undergraduate body of
Stanford. Stanford's football varsity is now enter
ing the last leg of its football journey for 1921.
From now 011, training will be more intensive, com
petition will be stiffer. The culmination of the reg
ular season, the Big Game with the University of
California, looms closer and closer.
Up to this time there has been a dearth of at
tendance at the daily practices of the Cardinal foot
ball players. Harking back to the good old days, it
was a habit, just like eating meals, to spend the aft
ernoon on the benches surrounding the turf field
watching the coaches put the gridiron candidates
through their paces. Then, everyone went. Every
one who did not play the game knew what the indi
vidual members of the squad were doing. They
knew that so-and-so was out for a tackle job and
was bound to get it. They knew what plays the
coaches were giving the team and just what progress
was being made.
With the expansion of the University, greater or
on has become necessary, in order success
conduct student affairs. Under the quarter
it is necessary that more intensive studying
done. Many members of the undergraduate
re active in student affairs. They are 011
committees of various sorts, while some are busy
working in the managerial department of sports.
Everyone has metings of some sort to attend or
duties that take his time, and between studies and
duties one finds very little time to see the athletic
teams in action. There is no dearth of interest in
mid-week athletics but merely a lack of time.
Now, the team labors every afternoon before
empty bleachers. The undergraduates turn out on
Saturday to see the team in action. They sometimes
become critical. They have not seen the struggles
of the coaches to put a team on the field; they do not
realize the efforts the players have put forth to pro
mote team .success, and they miss the purposes jus
tifying certain plays. All they see is the team in
action. They haven't a perspective of the whole sea
son and the relation of each practice and each game
to the ultimate goal—the winning of the Big Game.
Every person who does not attend every practice
possible is missing one of the pleasures of his under
graduate days. To 101 l at ease in the bleachers for a
few minutes after the drudge of work in the class
rooms; to watch the maneuvers of the men on the
field; to follow and learn the methods of the coaches
in building a team is an education in itself.
The men on the field appreciate the presence of
their fellows in the stands. When they look up and
see several hundred people watching them, they are
made to realize that their efforts are not in vain.
More and more is brought home to them the fact
that the service they are performing for Stanford
is worth while.
Thursday will be the day during the rest of foot
ball Season when every Stanford student who is not
on the football squads will go to the bleachers to
see the team in practice. Students go as much for
their own enjoyment as because of a feeling of duty.
If duty is to compel you to attend, don't let it. There
is an interest in the heart and mind that will instinc
tively draw each Stanford man and woman to the
field 011 this one day in the week.
Arrange those organization meetings and your
study schedule so that you can be numbered among
those present when the Stanford student body gath
ers for the first time next Thursday to watch the
Cardinal fooball men in practice.

knew that so-and-so was out for a tackle job and
was bound to get it. They knew what plays the
coaches were giving the team and just what progress
was being made.
With the expansion of the University, greater or
on has become necessary, in order success
conduct student affairs. Under the quarter
it is necessary that more intensive studying
done. Many members of the undergraduate
re active in student affairs. They are 011
committees of various sorts, while some are busy
working in the managerial department of sports.
Everyone has metings of some sort to attend or
duties that take his time, and between studies and
duties one finds very little time to see the athletic
teams in action. There is no dearth of interest in
mid-week athletics but merely a lack of time.
Now, the team labors every afternoon before
empty bleachers. The undergraduates turn out on
Saturday to see the team in action. They sometimes
become critical. They have not seen the struggles
of the coaches to put a team on the field; they do not
realize the efforts the players have put forth to pro
mote team .success, and they miss the purposes jus
tifying certain plays. All they see is the team in
action. They haven't a perspective of the whole sea
son and the relation of each practice and each game
to the ultimate goal—the winning of the Big Game.
Every person who does not attend every practice
possible is missing one of the pleasures of his under
graduate days. To 101 l at ease in the bleachers for a
few minutes after the drudge of work in the class
rooms; to watch the maneuvers of the men on the
field; to follow and learn the methods of the coaches
in building a team is an education in itself.
The men on the field appreciate the presence of
their fellows in the stands. When they look up and
see several hundred people watching them, they are
made to realize that their efforts are not in vain.
More and more is brought home to them the fact
that the service they are performing for Stanford
is worth while.
Thursday will be the day during the rest of foot
ball Season when every Stanford student who is not
on the football squads will go to the bleachers to
see the team in practice. Students go as much for
their own enjoyment as because of a feeling of duty.
If duty is to compel you to attend, don't let it. There
is an interest in the heart and mind that will instinc
tively draw each Stanford man and woman to the
field 011 this one day in the week.
Arrange those organization meetings and your
study schedule so that you can be numbered among
those present when the Stanford student body gath
ers for the first time next Thursday to watch the
Cardinal fooball men in practice.
Thursday will hereafter be designated as Bleacher
Day in the calendar of the undergraduate body of
Stanford. Stanford's football varsity is now enter
ing the last leg of its football journey for 1921.
From now 011, training will be more intensive, com
petition will be stiffer. The culmination of the reg
ular season, the Big Game with the University of
California, looms closer and closer.
Up to this time there has been a dearth of at
tendance at the daily practices of the Cardinal foot
ball players. Harking back to the good old days, it
was a habit, just like eating meals, to spend the aft
ernoon on the benches surrounding the turf field
watching the coaches put the gridiron candidates
through their paces. Then, everyone went. Every
one who did not play the game knew what the indi
vidual members of the squad were doing. They
knew that so-and-so was out for a tackle job and
was bound to get it. They knew what plays the
coaches were giving the team and just what progress
was being made.
