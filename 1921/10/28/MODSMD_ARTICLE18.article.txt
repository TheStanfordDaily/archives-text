# Admission Charges
## 
### 
It is costing approximately $100,000 to conduct
football at Stanford this season. With the expan
sion of the coaching staffs, and the necessity of
equipment for two of the largest squads that ever

turned out for football at Stanford, it has been neces
sary for the Board of Control to expend more of
their funds than usual on this one sport season.
For this reason it has been found necessary to
make an admission charge of $1 to holders of stu
dent body cards. Another reason for charging ad
mission to students is that every person who attends
the game from Stanford must be accounted for to
the Oregon Agricultural College. This is a retro
active policy which is operative in conference games
played by Stanford teams in other places.
There has been some complaint among the stu
dents against this charge. Several have threatened
to crash the gate for a free admission. Such a move
on the part of any student will force the Board of
Control on the defensive. It is doubtful if any Stan
ford men will try to evade paying the admission
charge. If they do and are caught at it their actions
will probably be the motif for action by the Men's
Council. Such an action will come under the same
category as scalping tickets to the Big Game,

"COME JOIN THE BAND" BECAME more
than a song yesterday afternoon. It was a real in
vitation. Professor Martin had his musicians, slip
horns, altos, drums, and all, in front of the Stanford
Inn yesterday afternoon for an open air concert.
Almost entirely unadvertised, and unknown to the
bulk of the students, Stanford's leading musical
organization quietly moved in and not so quietly
proceeded to produce sweet music. But a band is
its own best advertisement and in a few minutes
an appreciative audience had gathered.
Stanford enjoys these impromptu treats and is
thankful to Professor Martin and the Stanford
Band.

FRESHMAN STUDENTS WILL BE AIDED in
accustoming themselves to the college life, ideals, and
traditions by a series of lectures which will lie given
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A. during the
next few weeks.
The problem of the new student is a difficult one.
He must be assimilated by the University, and he
must learn as much as he can of the ideals and
purposes of the institution within a short space of
time if he is to become an asset to Stanford and if
he is to secure the things that he came here for.
1 he series of assemblies which have been arranged
covers a wide field of pertinent subjects. They
will benefit every first-year student who attends.
