The Law and Order League suggests a good one to the
Suicide Club. Chief Chemist of Prohibition announces
per the league that the chances are fifty to one that
bootleg whiskey or gin is poisonous. Membership appli
cations filed three blocks down. Yes, sir, that's the
end of the line back there.

Philip Space says that it's worth the forty-nine to be
revived with the fiftieth.

The Inspector tells the world that he would just as
soon go into a drug store and drink the contents of
bottles blindfolded. What if it is a good progressive
drug store?

Couple of organizations have banned soph hats. The
banners win the crocheted banner. Too many shekels
wasted on a shelved tradition. Pass the hat, '24.

Move we hold a millinery auction. . Bidders—takers;
—Finders—losers.

Sophs are advised by leading lights to walk up and
down freshman spines, seeking fertile soil for tradition
and spirit seed planting. Month later, same lights
chase them off. Fine. Nobody satisfied now. Moral —
Too many fingers in the underclass pie.

"Bail us out," cried the drunk on the prison-ship.

Appropriate Songs
GIVE ME THE RIGHT —When the groom holds the
wrong hand.
JAPANESE SAND MAN —When the janitor pilfers
your pills, (lots o' grit).
TELL ME WHY —When you get this, (-).
EVERYBODY'S DOING IT —When you razz a fresh
man.
WHEN YOU'RPJ ALONE —(Sung by Robinson Caruso).

A communication from X. Y. Z. advises the accept
ance of contributions "like the following, to wit":
Thanks, X. Y. Z. for admitting that they are contri
buted "to wit." Thanks, also for the contributions. We
wrote one of them ourselves and published it in the
Chappie last year. As a chestnut, the other is full
grown fruit.

A Poor Marineress
(Special dispatch from the P. O.)
Cabbage Editor: —Some time ago a freshman football
player sustained an injury to his knee. After writing
to a friend at home, he received this answer:
TO HARRY:
She used to sit upon his lap,
As happy as could be;
But now it makes her seasick,
He has water on nis knee.

Something leads us to believe that the above is a
camouflaged chestnut. However, the majority of us
are prone to sustain an occasional slip, even if banana
peelings are getting scarce.

"WELL, YOU LOOK BORED," REMARKED THE
OIL DRILLER.
