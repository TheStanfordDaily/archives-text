# RHODES SCHOLAR NOMINEES PICKED
## 
### 
The committee appointed by Presi
dent Wilbur to examine candidates for
Rhodes' Scholarships returned the
names of Richard H. Barker, Robert
Rinkley, Roger Blackburn and William
J. Kemnitzer. These four will be rec
ommended to the state committee from
Stanford and will, in turn, be examined
by them for scholarshap, personality and
athletic ability. The date for this ex
amination has been for December 3d,
and the scholarship will be awarded
some time in January.
This year there were the largest num
ber of candidates that ever applied, and
it was with difficulty that the committee
selected the four they approved because
of the excellent qualifications of all the
applicants.
A Rhodes Scholarship brings $350 a
year, and is held for three years. Can
didates are appointed without written
examination on the basis of their school
and college records. No restrictions are
placed on studies. The two men elected
from California this year will enter Ox
ford in the fall of 1922.

the debating team that beat the Uni
versity of Washington last year, and is

orary debating fraternity.
