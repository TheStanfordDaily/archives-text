# Old "S" Men Given Block of Seats With Rooters
## 
### 
All former "S" men sending in ap
plications for Big Game tickcts are be
ing assigned to the Block "S" seats in
the rooting section. "S" men from 1915
011, unmarried, will thus have the op
portunity of renewing their undergrad
uate hoarseness. It is hoped that with
the letter men at present on the cam
pus, a block of fifty red sweaters will
be placed in the center of the Stanford
section.
