# SOCCER VARSITY TO MEET LEGION SQUAD IN TOMORROW'S FRAY
## 
### 
Fremont Post No. 52 of the Ameri
can Legion will be the next opponent for
the Stanford soccer varsity. This will
be Stanford's third game in the Univer
sity and Club Soccer League. I twill
take place tomorrow at 3 o'clock on the
Stanford soccer turf.
Eight former Stanford students form
the nucleus of the Legion team. Most
of these me nwere varsity players while

Jin college. They have the necessary
speed and are gradually developing the
art of working together.
George Clark is back in his old posi
tion of outside right, and Dan Taylor
will hold down the left half position.
Both Clark and Taylor have been show
ing up well, and their addition to the
eleven ought to make itself evident.
Taylor is a consistent player, and he
kicks well with either foot. Dwight,
who is speedily developing into a well
rounded center forward, will hold down
that position.
