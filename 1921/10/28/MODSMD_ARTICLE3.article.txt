Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor
emeritus of the University, was the
principal speaker Wednesday even
ing, before the Open Forum of Trinity
Center in San Francisco.
He chose as his subject: "The Possi

by him a week or so ago, before the
Nestoria Debating Society, here on the
campus, on a similar subject.
The program concluded with a mo
