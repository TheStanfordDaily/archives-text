# SKULL AND SNAKES STARTS 'PEP' DRIVE
## Honor Society Protests Lack of Athletic Enthusiasm; to Designate Bleacher Days 
### 
Skull and Snakes, thoroughly con
vinced that student interest in ath
letics is too lax, laid plans in its
meeting last night in the Union, to re
vive the traditional spirit.
Particularly did the society criti
cize the turnout at practice games 011
the Bay City grid and even 011 the
Stanford field. "Winning teams and
student body spirit go hand in hand,"
said President C. J. Tauzer, '20, in
commenting 011 the lack of student
interest in the past three games.
As part of its campaign to enliven
enthusiasm, the society has designed
every Thursday afternoon, from 4:00
to 5:00, the only time Coach Van
Gent will allow the team to work in
the open, as "Bleacher Day," when
every live student is expected to be
011 the field to cheer the squad.
Skull and Snakes' plan for a rous
ing enthusiasm is augmented today
by fourteen "S" men, who will can
vass every campus living group to
urge the attendance of members of
the different living groups at the
games.
"S" men will have a bleacher sec
tion in the Big Game, President Tau
zer announced. They may secure
tickets from Dick Richmond, '21, at
the Phi Psi house.
