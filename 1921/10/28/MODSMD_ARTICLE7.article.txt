## 
### 
Lowell High and (he Cardinal fresh
men will furnish the aquatic part of the
week-end sport calendar when their
swimmers compete tomorrow morning
in the Encina gym pool at 10:30 o'clock.
Lowell holds a victory over the 1924
freshmen paddlers and is invading the
campus this year with high hopes of re
peating. Felton, of the prep school
team, holds the Pacific coast inter
scholastic title for the plunge for dis
tance, with a mark of 72 feet. Lowell
has two other men who will bear watch
ing in Brophy, who does the sprints,
and in Lysle, entered in the diving.
Brandsten has had but little time in
which to develop an all-around first
year squad, but his men should give a
good account of themselves. Captain
Klebahn, in the 50, is almost sure of
points, and Belcher should be among the
first two in the 220.
Don Young and Hirschman in the 66-
vard back stroke, have shown lots of
promise, and they will show to good ad
vantage. If the meet depends upon the
relay, Brandsten has a number of fast
men from whom to choose. The fresh
men swimming in the final event will be
chosen from Klebahn, Myers, Taylor,
Peters, McAllister, Mulgart and Hall.
On paper, the Lowell swimmers should
win first honors in both the diving
events, but the entries in the races ap
pear to be evenly matched.

yards—Klebahn (captain), Mulgart and
Taylor; KM) yards—McAllister, Myers
