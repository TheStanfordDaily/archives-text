# SOCCER ELEVEN TIES AMERICAN LEGION, 1-1
## 
### 
For the first time this season, Coach
Harry Maloney's soccer team had its
equal. Fremont Fost, No. 52. nf the
American Legion held the Stanford
varsity to a 1 to 1 tie in one of the
fastest demonstrations of soccer ever
seen on the campus. It was nip and
tuck all the way through the game,
neither side gaining the advantage
over the other. At half time the Legi
on led 1 to 0.
The game might well be called a
battle between the Stanford varsity
and Stanford alumni. Eight of the
men that played on the Legion team
had played on the Stanford soccer
team at one time or another. All
members of the squad have been stu
dents. As most of these men have
been trained by Coach Maloney, both
teams used the same style of play.
During the first half, the play was
confined to the center of the turf,
the backfields of both teams getting
off long and clean boots. Only at one
time in this period did the Stanford
backs give way to the onslaught of
the Legion forwards. This was dur
ing the last few minutes of the half,
and it was at this time that the Legi
on scored their only point.
At the optset of .the second half, the
Stanford forwards got under way and
scored. It looked for a moment like
it was going to be another victory for
Stanford as the linemen were rushing
the goal with perfect formation, and
the half-backs were keeping the ball
well up in opposing territory. The
forwards, however, lacked the push to
send the ball over, and although they
had several chances they did not score
again. Near the final whistle, the
Legion forwards started a rush on the
Cardinal goal, but the backfleld kept
them from scoring.
Peavy, Cardinal center forward, was,
without a doubt, the star of the game.
Not only is he the man that kicked
the tieing score of the game, but he
also was a great factor in breaking
up the Legion offensives. On the line
Dwight. was Peavy's most consistant
player. This is Dwight's first year on
the varsity and from all appearances
lie is Maloney's choice for inside right.
Guy Honey was the Legion mainstay.
By mutual agreement of the cap
tains of the teams, substitutes could
be used in the game. For this rea
son both teams tried new combina
tions in the second half.
