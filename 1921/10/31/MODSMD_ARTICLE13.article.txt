Stanford's football varsity is now aimed directly
at the Golden C jrizzly. Results in Saturday's con
test with the Oregon Agricultural eleven showed
that Stanford has a lighting football aggregation.
More, they showed that Stanford has the fightin'est
eleven it has had in three years.
The Aggies came to the campus bearing the ter
rifying title, "the Fighting Aggies." That was
right: they were fighters. But Coach Van Gent's
Cardinal pigskin warriors outfought them. They
outplayed and outguessed them. The odds were all
against the Cardinal. Stafnord teams always play
better when the odds are against them. They did
Saturday.
The Aggie game was the break of the season.
From now on in, who is going to stop the Van Gent
machine? Playing as it did Saturday, the Cardi
nal eleven will defeat Washington at Seattle next
Saturday, and it should repeat in easier fashion
against the University of Nevada on the following
week.
Which brings us to the premier event of the foot
ball season, the Big Game with the University of
California on November 19. Andy Smith still has
a wonderful team, but not a wonder team. The
Bruins reached the top of their form last year.
I hey are not on the decline by any means, but they
are simply playing great football. Stanford has just
made the turn on the road to fame. A team which is
just approaching the apex of its effectiveness is
always more dangerous because you never know
what to expect from it. The chances for the un
expected to happen are always greater in a team of
this sort. This was demonstrated in the last game.
Without making any definite prophesies it is
"easonably safe to say that the Big Game of 1921
.vill be a real battle.
