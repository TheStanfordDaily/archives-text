# The 						Freshman Eleven
## 
### 
Not to be outdone by the Cardinal Varsity, Coach
Duffy Seay's Hal )es went out and gathered unto
themselves another victory. The first-year squad
has yet to suffer defeat, although they were tied in
one game. This augurs well for a victory in the
little Rig Game on November 12 at Berkeley.
Their playing was good enough Saturday to cause
"Swede" Righter, who now coaches the College of
the Pacific eleven, to remark that "if the frosh
don't win the game from California this year we
might as well give up hope of ever copping one."
The first-year eleven will be given a real test next
Saturday when it encounters the Lincoln High
School team of Los Angeles. This game is figured
as the most difficult of the freshman preliminary
schedule. If the 1925 team makes this last hurdle
with any sort of ease it will go into the game with
the Bruin Cubs on even terms or possibly as the
favorites.
