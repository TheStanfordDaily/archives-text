# The
						Coaches.

Coach Gene Van Gent and his three assistants,
Fitzgerald, Canning, and Templeton, are due for
words of praise because of the showing made by the
Stanford eleven.
Their work has been nothing short of marvelous.
Practically all of the veterans who returned for foot
ball on September 15 were backfield men. It was
necessary to build almost an entirely new line.
Within six weeks this line was formed with but two
veterans performing in it. The strength of the
Stanford first defense was demonstrated against the
Fighting Aggies.
More than building a new line, the Stanford
coaches, starting from scratch, have produced a real
football machine, installed a new system of play,
and placed Stanford in the first rank of the con
tenders for the Pacific Coast Conference title.
The Board of Athletic Control is to be commended
on its wisdom in selecting such able coaches, and
the coaches are to be congratulated upon the success
of the Stanford football varsity.
