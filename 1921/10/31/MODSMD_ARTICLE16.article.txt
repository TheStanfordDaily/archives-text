# CABBAGES and THINGS

Beginning with this Blue Monday, we start a new
era. The world needs help. (See want-ad section,
p. 4). So Cabbages might as well pitch in and help to
help. Therefore, we announce that on almost every
Monday, at least, there will be a Welfare Department,
for the relief of the troubled and oppressed.

All communications should be addressed to Box 1334,
and will be considered strictly confidential, being pub
lished only in the Cabbage Colyum... Do not sign your
name (or anybody else's),
# * *
The below is a fair sample of what not to ask.
# * *
"Kabbage Kollum —I am a young co-ed of 25 (class,
not age). I know a young man who belongs to the
varsity squad—he takes me there every time Lila Lee
is on the bill. But it's two weeks now and he hasn't
yet told me he loves me. He hasn't even tried to kiss
me. What's wrong?—Q. E. D."
* * *
We don't answer these kinds of questions. The
Thursday Section Boss could probably give you all
the dope, from first-hand experience. Send him your
picture, anyway.
* >i< #
Talking about welfare work, we're all for making
crap-shooting a minor sport, at least. Possibly later, a
major sport. Then, with the development of an expert
squad, the stadium could be paid for in no time.
* * *
.. .Varsity members could be given a Rolling S. Men on
probation should be given, preference. They're usually
the best at it.

"Soccer Team Plays Barbarians" —headline. No

* » *
That's going too far. First thing you know, we'll
be up against the Congo-East Africa Murderer's Row
for a vicious pie-eating contest or something. There's
a limit, as the speed-cop remarked.
* * *
Have you ever heard a professor multiply out loud
while working a knotty one on the blackboard.
* * *
It sounds something like this on Blue Monday:
"Seven times six is forty-two, two, four to carry, six
down and four to go, seven off, six to jump, two more
loose, one—two —three —four—twenty-six-ball! Check:
free catch! Answer: six decimals and a zero."
* * *
All of which brings us another helpful hint. Instead
of learning things by rote, so to think, let's get on a
scow and imbibe knowledge via the jingle route. For
instance:
* * *
Econ. 10
Put a dollar in the bank;
See it fatten, hear it clank;
Peel the .twitch of money-itch,
And if you're lucky you'll get rich.
* * *
Philosophy 1.
Argue here, argue there.
Manufacture more hot air;
Reason till you lose your reason,
But shun the fallacy—it's treason!
* * »
Then, in the more advanced courses, the words could
be set to music. But we'll leave that to Myron or
Ambrose or somebody. Besides, the faculty may con
ceivably not approve of it.

shellaced, "to preserve the grain fo sense."

Northern papers were condoning the fact that the
Cards would furnish such a poor work-out for the
Aggies. Looked pretty good to us. They worked 'em
out of the game.
* * *
We wish to commend Ludeke's new kick. It bounced
backward. All hail the man with the boomerang boot.
* * *
We don't blame the Aggies for refusing to punt until
the fourth down. Who wouldn't when the kicks are
all returned to the line of scrimmage?

There was a young lady called Maggie,
Who married an Oregon Aggie,
Who said, "Won't you please?"
As he sank to his knees,
Which made them exceedingly baggy.

Beginning with this Blue Monday, we start a new
era. The world needs help. (See want-ad section,
p. 4). So Cabbages might as well pitch in and help to
help. Therefore, we announce that on almost every
Monday, at least, there will be a Welfare Department,
for the relief of the troubled and oppressed.

"Kabbage Kollum —I am a young co-ed of 25 (class,
not age). I know a young man who belongs to the
varsity squad—he takes me there every time Lila Lee
is on the bill. But it's two weeks now and he hasn't
yet told me he loves me. He hasn't even tried to kiss
me. What's wrong?—Q. E. D."

We don't answer these kinds of questions. The
Thursday Section Boss could probably give you all

Have you ever heard a professor multiply out loud

It sounds something like this on Blue Monday:
"Seven times six is forty-two, two, four to carry, six
down and four to go, seven off, six to jump, two more
loose, one—two —three —four—twenty-six-ball! Check:
free catch! Answer: six decimals and a zero."

All of which brings us another helpful hint. Instead
of learning things by rote, so to think, let's get on a
scow and imbibe knowledge via the jingle route. For

HE THREW A HEAVY LINE—YES, AMBROSIA,
HE WAS A LIFE-GUARD.

Beginning with this Blue Monday, we start a new
era. The world needs help. (See want-ad section,
p. 4). So Cabbages might as well pitch in and help to
help. Therefore, we announce that on almost every
Monday, at least, there will be a Welfare Department,
for the relief of the troubled and oppressed.

All communications should be addressed to Box 1334,
and will be considered strictly confidential, being pub

The below is a fair sample of what not to ask.

"Kabbage Kollum —I am a young co-ed of 25 (class,
not age). I know a young man who belongs to the
varsity squad—he takes me there every time Lila Lee
is on the bill. But it's two weeks now and he hasn't
yet told me he loves me. He hasn't even tried to kiss
me. What's wrong?—Q. E. D."
* * *
We don't answer these kinds of questions. The
Thursday Section Boss could probably give you all
the dope, from first-hand experience. Send him your
picture, anyway.

Talking about welfare work, we're all for making
crap-shooting a minor sport, at least. Possibly later, a
major sport. Then, with the development of an expert
squad, the stadium could be paid for in no time.

.. .Varsity members could be given a Rolling S. Men on
probation should be given, preference. They're usually
the best at it.

"Soccer Team Plays Barbarians" —headline. No
wonder mother prays for son!

That's going too far. First thing you know, we'll
be up against the Congo-East Africa Murderer's Row
for a vicious pie-eating contest or something. There's
a limit, as the speed-cop remarked.

Have you ever heard a professor multiply out loud
while working a knotty one on the blackboard.

It sounds something like this on Blue Monday:
"Seven times six is forty-two, two, four to carry, six
down and four to go, seven off, six to jump, two more
loose, one—two —three —four—twenty-six-ball! Check:
free catch! Answer: six decimals and a zero."
* * *
All of which brings us another helpful hint. Instead
of learning things by rote, so to think, let's get on a
scow and imbibe knowledge via the jingle route. For
instance:

Econ. 10
Put a dollar in the bank;
See it fatten, hear it clank;
Peel the .twitch of money-itch,
And if you're lucky you'll get rich.

Philosophy 1.
Argue here, argue there.
Manufacture more hot air;
Reason till you lose your reason,
But shun the fallacy—it's treason!

Then, in the more advanced courses, the words could
be set to music. But we'll leave that to Myron or
Ambrose or somebody. Besides, the faculty may con
ceivably not approve of it.

Northern papers were condoning the fact that the
Cards would furnish such a poor work-out for the
Aggies. Looked pretty good to us. They worked 'em
out of the game.

We wish to commend Ludeke's new kick. It bounced
backward. All hail the man with the boomerang boot.
* * *
We don't blame the Aggies for refusing to punt until
the fourth down. Who wouldn't when the kicks are
all returned to the line of scrimmage?

There was a young lady called Maggie,
Who married an Oregon Aggie,
Who said, "Won't you please?"
As he sank to his knees,
Which made them exceedingly baggy.
