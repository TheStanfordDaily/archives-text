# '25 CLASS MERMEN OVERWHELM LOWELL
## 
### 
After the Stanford freshman swim
mers had finished annexing points for
themselves Saturday morning, at the
Encina pool, theie was mighty little
left for the paddlers from Lowell Hi
to get, and the yearlings consequently
helped themselves to the long end of
a 57 to 17 score.
Five out of eight first places for
the Cardinal mermen went toward
rolling up the big score. Lowell
crossed the finish line ahead only in
the 100 and 220 yard events.
Young, Klebahn, Rising were among
the Cardinal swimmers who had a
most successful morning. Klebahn
started the good work by swimming
a fast lap in the relay, and then pro
ceeded to show his heels to the field
in the 50-yard sprint. Young made
the best time of the meet when he
negotiated the 66-yard back stroke in
36.1 seconds'. Rising surprised every
one, including himself, when he floated
to the 64-foot mark in the plunge for
distance.
Lester Smith, holder of the national
junior championship in the 220-yanls,
and a former Lowell man, came down
with his former team-mates and took
part in exhibition races. He loafed
through the 220 just enough to finish
several ahead of Brophy of
Lowell. In the 100 yards, Smith show
ed his speed and covered the distance
in the fast time of 57.4 seconds.
