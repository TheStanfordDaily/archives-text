# LESTER SEIB AND MILDRED FINLEY STAR IN COMEDY
## "Tailor-Made Man" is Voted Success; Characterization Is Good for "Title" Play 
### (By H. B. Rorke, '24 
Talented acting, last Friday even
ing, rescued the "Tailor-Made Man" —
this year's S"'ord and Sandals produc
tion —fro*u deserving the gonfalon
awardable to the tritest, most ma
chine-made "Broadway Success." It
is safe to call the comedy a clever
one for it embodies all of the points
which have been called clever since
Broadway was first electrified. To
Les Seib, Mildred Finley, and Coach
Gordon Davies, belongs most of the
credit for the salvage. They led the
campaign to give the farce a char
acter and with their very good sup
port, succeeded.
It was the story of a tailor who stole
a dress suit and put over an adapted
idea of another man. The tailor's per
sonality had gotten both of his ac
quisitions the cast of reality and a
good position as a prospective mil
lionaire, when the jealous villain bares
the life the hero lives, in the third
act, and causes his meteor-like fall.
However, it develops that it is mere
ly a fall into the heroine's arms and a
chance for the richest company next
to the Treasure Department to plead
with the exposed imposter to save
the mortgage for it and take the reins
in hand. Yet, heriosm must be
served.
John Paul Bart is the name of the
tailor with the personality. In this
role, Les Seib compelled the audience's
admiration with the poise and finish
which has always characterized his
performances. In what was an
nounced as his last appearance on
the campus stage, after three years
of popularity. Seib set a difficult
mark for coming generations to sur
pass. In carriage, voice, command,
individuality and comprehension he
showed himself quite the best student
actor on the campus.
The part Seib took was rather
eccentric and wordy. Except for one
or two. pauses, which are in large
part to be blamed on the shortness
of the rehearsals and his duties as
coach of the coming Chappie show,
he gave the most sustainedly intelli
gent performance the campus has liad
offered in some time.
Mildred Finley made her first bow
over the Assembly Hall footlights in
this same play, which is Seib's last
one. As Mrs. Kitty Dupuy, Miss Fin
ley checked off more genuine laughs
than any other woman in the 1 cast.
Tn all, her performance justified 'the
Statement that in losing one star with
the falling of the final curtain, Friday,
campus dramatics has found another.
Her graceful movements and clever
gestures supported an extraordinarily
good voice. Full, rich, and expressive,
it alone was enough to classify the
able and tactful divorcee at the head
of the list.
Dorothy Woodhead, who played op
posite Seib, had the difficult task of
presenting the obedient, sweet, kind
and angelic Tanya Huber, the boss's
daughter, who John Paul Bart finally
decides to adore in ,t»he last act. in
whatever snatches character entered
the part, Miss Woodhead was very
convincing, especially in the last act.
However, most ,of the time the drab,
colorless interpretation of the perfect
little lady unfortunately hid her ability
under a bushel. ,
One of the redeeming features of the
play was the opportunity it offered for
odd characterization, for a peculiarly
able group was cast in these parts
Paul Claflin, of course, got the hun
dred and first per cent of comedy from
his role of the exicteable Englishman, 1
who was forced to appear at the re- !
ception in misfit clothes after his own
had been stolen.
Fred Hughes was probably the most
perfect of all the extremists. His
cockney dialect was very well done
and held up throughout. A. D. Cohan
put genuiue scotch in the mouth of
Peter McConkie. He gave a most cre
ditable performance of the duty-full
baster and illuminated it with splendid
gestures.
Cecil Morris, as Huber, retained a I

fine German acccnt ympathy
which distinguished mo po« iormance.
Had T. H. Kennedy, who played the
villain, approximated the former's
tility of expression, the villain would
not have been so bush league as to
' have never coldly sneered, as is tra
, ditional with the villain's. Kennedy's
storming should have had a little rest
to break the monotony and it would
have been much ( more natura/1 al
; though it could be no more successful.
Kathleen Evans did a great deal
with a small part. A modest violet
whose head was her mother's, was
Betty l)upuy. She was a direct oppo
: site in her accentuated coyness to the
haughty heiress, as played by Mabel
Ferry. Miss Perry played the proud
beauty with sureness and discern
ment.
Margaret Howard acted the efficient
stenographer in a very finished man
ner. She held up the brusque imper
sonal character with a sureness which
was encouraging.
The settings and costumes were well
co-ordinated and especially in the sec
ond act combined very attractively.
Ed Farmer who designed this set de
serves credit for a great deal of the
other stage effects.

the life the hero lives, in the third
act, and causes his meteor-like fall.
However, it develops that it is mere

John Paul Bart is the name of the
tailor with the personality. In this
role, Les Seib compelled the audience's
admiration with the poise and finish
which has always characterized his
performances. In what was an
nounced as his last appearance on
the campus stage, after three years
of popularity. Seib set a difficult
mark for coming generations to sur
pass. In carriage, voice, command,
individuality and comprehension he
showed himself quite the best student
actor on the campus.
The part Seib took was rather
eccentric and wordy. Except for one
or two. pauses, which are in large
part to be blamed on the shortness
of the rehearsals and his duties as
coach of the coming Chappie show,
he gave the most sustainedly intelli
gent performance the campus has liad
offered in some time.
Mildred Finley made her first bow
over the Assembly Hall footlights in
this same play, which is Seib's last
one. As Mrs. Kitty Dupuy, Miss Fin
ley checked off more genuine laughs
than any other woman in the 1 cast.
Tn all, her performance justified 'the
Statement that in losing one star with
the falling of the final curtain, Friday,
campus dramatics has found another.
Her graceful movements and clever
gestures supported an extraordinarily
good voice. Full, rich, and expressive,
it alone was enough to classify the
able and tactful divorcee at the head
of the list.
Dorothy Woodhead, who played op
posite Seib, had the difficult task of
presenting the obedient, sweet, kind
and angelic Tanya Huber, the boss's
daughter, who John Paul Bart finally
decides to adore in ,t»he last act. in
whatever snatches character entered
the part, Miss Woodhead was very
convincing, especially in the last act.
However, most ,of the time the drab,
colorless interpretation of the perfect
little lady unfortunately hid her ability
under a bushel. ,
One of the redeeming features of the
play was the opportunity it offered for
odd characterization, for a peculiarly
able group was cast in these parts
Paul Claflin, of course, got the hun
dred and first per cent of comedy from
his role of the exicteable Englishman, 1
who was forced to appear at the re- !
ception in misfit clothes after his own
had been stolen.
Fred Hughes was probably the most
perfect of all the extremists. His
cockney dialect was very well done
and held up throughout. A. D. Cohan
put genuiue scotch in the mouth of
Peter McConkie. He gave a most cre
ditable performance of the duty-full
baster and illuminated it with splendid
gestures.
Cecil Morris, as Huber, retained a I

fine German acccnt ympathy
which distinguished mo po« iormance.
Had T. H. Kennedy, who played the
villain, approximated the former's
tility of expression, the villain would
not have been so bush league as to
' have never coldly sneered, as is tra
, ditional with the villain's. Kennedy's
storming should have had a little rest
to break the monotony and it would
have been much ( more natura/1 al
; though it could be no more successful.
Kathleen Evans did a great deal
with a small part. A modest violet
whose head was her mother's, was
Betty l)upuy. She was a direct oppo
: site in her accentuated coyness to the
haughty heiress, as played by Mabel
Ferry. Miss Perry played the proud
beauty with sureness and discern
ment.
Margaret Howard acted the efficient
stenographer in a very finished man
ner. She held up the brusque imper
sonal character with a sureness which
was encouraging.
The settings and costumes were well
co-ordinated and especially in the sec
ond act combined very attractively.
Ed Farmer who designed this set de
serves credit for a great deal of the
other stage effects.

coach of the coming Chappie show,
he gave the most sustainedly intelli
gent performance the campus has liad
offered in some time.
Mildred Finley made her first bow
over the Assembly Hall footlights in
this same play, which is Seib's last
one. As Mrs. Kitty Dupuy, Miss Fin
ley checked off more genuine laughs
than any other woman in the 1 cast.
Tn all, her performance justified 'the
Statement that in losing one star with
the falling of the final curtain, Friday,
campus dramatics has found another.
Her graceful movements and clever
gestures supported an extraordinarily
good voice. Full, rich, and expressive,
it alone was enough to classify the
able and tactful divorcee at the head
of the list.
Dorothy Woodhead, who played op
posite Seib, had the difficult task of
presenting the obedient, sweet, kind
and angelic Tanya Huber, the boss's
daughter, who John Paul Bart finally
decides to adore in ,t»he last act. in
whatever snatches character entered
the part, Miss Woodhead was very
convincing, especially in the last act.
However, most ,of the time the drab,
colorless interpretation of the perfect
little lady unfortunately hid her ability
under a bushel. ,
One of the redeeming features of the
play was the opportunity it offered for
odd characterization, for a peculiarly
able group was cast in these parts
Paul Claflin, of course, got the hun
dred and first per cent of comedy from
his role of the exicteable Englishman, 1
who was forced to appear at the re- !
ception in misfit clothes after his own
had been stolen.
Fred Hughes was probably the most
perfect of all the extremists. His
cockney dialect was very well done
and held up throughout. A. D. Cohan
put genuiue scotch in the mouth of
Peter McConkie. He gave a most cre
ditable performance of the duty-full
baster and illuminated it with splendid
gestures.
Cecil Morris, as Huber, retained a I

fine German acccnt ympathy
which distinguished mo po« iormance.
Had T. H. Kennedy, who played the
villain, approximated the former's
tility of expression, the villain would
not have been so bush league as to
' have never coldly sneered, as is tra
, ditional with the villain's. Kennedy's
storming should have had a little rest
to break the monotony and it would
have been much ( more natura/1 al
; though it could be no more successful.
Kathleen Evans did a great deal
with a small part. A modest violet
whose head was her mother's, was
Betty l)upuy. She was a direct oppo
: site in her accentuated coyness to the
haughty heiress, as played by Mabel
Ferry. Miss Perry played the proud
beauty with sureness and discern
ment.
Margaret Howard acted the efficient
stenographer in a very finished man
ner. She held up the brusque imper
sonal character with a sureness which
was encouraging.
The settings and costumes were well
co-ordinated and especially in the sec
ond act combined very attractively.
Ed Farmer who designed this set de
serves credit for a great deal of the
other stage effects.
