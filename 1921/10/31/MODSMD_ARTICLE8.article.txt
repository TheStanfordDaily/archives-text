# BABES OVERWHELM RIGHTER'S ELEVEN
## Coach Seay's Backs Romp Through College of Pacific Defense for 49 to 6 Score 
### (By C. H. Prior, '23 
Coach Seay's freshman eleven romped
away with another easy victory on the
local field Saturday afternoon when
they sent "Swede" Righter's proteges
from the College of the Pacific home
with a 49 to 6 defeat hanging over their
heads. •
Gilliland starred for the Babes and
played a wonderful game from the first
whistle to the last gun. Captain Spoon,
playing at halfback, stood out as the
strongest player for the visitors. Den
nis, the freshman captain, and Cudde
hack, the husky fullback with the long
range boot, made many of the gains and
are two men upon which the yearlings
are pinning their hopes of beating the
Bruin Babes.
From start to finish the contest was
lop-sided, and the outcome could have
been easily guessed in the first five min
utes of play. With greater teamwork
and more consistency, the Babes could
easily have piled up twice as many tal
lies. The one Orange and Black touch
down was a fluke.
When Righter's men fumbled on
their own 20-yard line in the first three
minutes of play, Gilliland took the ball
on the first Babe offensive and picked
his way through for a touchdown. Den
nis kicked the goal.
An exchange of punts continued
through the first quarter with Cudde
back averaging about forty yards. The
freshmen started an offensive from
their own 40-yard line in the last few
minutes of the quarter but, between
messed forward passes and penalties,
they lost the ball. Telfer, the Orange
and Black fullback, took the ball and
was pushed back to his own 4-yard line.
Then came a queer turn of events.
Telfer fumbled in trying to punt and
kicked the from the ground. Den
nis caught it a few yards from the line
and ran over for the second touchdown.
Dennis kicked the goal.
Dennis started a freshman offensive
by running the ball from his own 35-
yard line to the visitors' 47. Gilliland
and Cuddeback carried for 7 and 8-yard
gains. Wheat completed a pass to Gilli
land for 22 yards. Dole came around
for 6 yards,,, Cuddeback made 3, and
Dennis 'crossed the line for the third
touchdown. D'cnnis kicked the goal.
With the ball on the visitors' 46-yard
line, Wheat passed to Gilliland, who
carried it to the 18-yard line. Dennis
carried for 16 yards more. Gilliland
made a long lateral run to the other
side of the field for no gain. In the
next play the Babes fumbled and Knoles
ran the complete length of the field for
the lone Orange and Black touchdown.
They were not allowed to try for goal
because they touched the ball down on
the field.
Starting from the Pacific 48-yard line,
in the third quarter, Dennis, Gilliland
and Cuddeback made consistent gains
down the field, Dennis carrying oyer for
the touchdown and kicking the goal.
Cuddeback kicked over the goal line on
the next kick-off. The Babes pushed
the Pacificites back to the 13-yard line
and then over the goal line for a safety,
netting two more points.
Telfer attempted a pass from his own
30-yard line just before the gun of the
third quarter and Cuddeback caught it,
carrying it back to the 10-yard line.
During the first part of the fourth
quarter Coach Seay sent in an entirely
new lineup. In two consecutive plays,
Howard carried over for a touchdown.
Cuddeback missed the goal. A pass
from Dickey to Howard brought the
next touchdown and Howard kicked
goal.
For the final touchdown, Hooper,
Hartnan and Howard started an offen
sive from the Pacific 32-yard line and
Howard carried the ball across. He
missed the goal.
Howard and Harman proved their
abilities as line-plungers and open field
runners. Both played strong games
throughout the time they were on the
field.
