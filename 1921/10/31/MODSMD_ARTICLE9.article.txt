# VARSITY GRIDMEN UPSET DOPE BY BEATING AGGIES, 14-7
## VICTORY TIES STANFORD TEAM WITH CALIFORNIA FOR CONFERENCE LEAD Wilcox, Patrick and Shlaudeman Star in Game Here Saturday 
### (By E. C. West, '23 
I7OR THE SECOND TIME in two years, Stanford, doped to be beaten, has
repelled the invasion of a northern football team.
The Cardinal is today tied for the lead in the Pacific Coast Conference
by virtue of defeating the Oregon Aggies, 14 to 7, here Saturday.
It was a case of a faster, cleverer organization, pitted against a heavier,
overconfident team that was not satisfied with a tie.
There was no fluke about Stanford's victory Saturday. The figures on
the stenographer's pad will vouch for thot. The breaks of the game were
evenly divided. Stanford took advantage of hers; the Aggies did not.
To Art Wilcox, whose work is never marked by anything save mechanical
precision, go the honors of the game; to Bob Shlaudeman, who appears so
calm and collected about everything he does, that one wonders if he really
could get excited on a football field if he tried, go more honors, and to Cap
tain Jack Patrick, who intercepted an Aggie pass and raced thirty yards
through a broken field to a touchdown that broke a 7-7 tie and gave victory
to Stanford, go still more.

Wilcox played the best game of his
career Saturday. His work was never
flashy but he followed his interference
perfectly and when once in the open
displayed the best knowledge of just
where to go that has been shown here
this season.
Shlaudeman's ability to run back
punts was nothing short of uncanny.
Time after time he would slip, swerve
and dodge down the field for long
runs; leaving in his wake half a dozen
Aggie tacklers.
He used splendid judgment in run
ning the team.
Stanford's victory means that the
Cards must be considered as a con
tender for the conference title and
that the title practically rests between
Van Gent's team and the University of
California. The Big Game will be
bigger than ever this year.
Van Gent's new play of using the
end out to come in and clip the op
posing tackle worked for big gains all
during the first lialf of the game. With
Wilcox running through large holes
for long gains, the Cards worked the
ball to the Aggies fifteen-yard mark.
All this time the end had been playing
out and coming into the line of scrim
mage.
It was here that Shlaudeman used
the "ace" play. Instead of coming
into the lie of play, "Shorty" Mertz
ran straight down the field, stepped
over the goal line and caught a per
fectly thrown pass from Shlaudeman
for the first score of the afternoon.
Wilcox kicked goal.
Stanford was bearing doAvn the
field near the close of the third quar
ter, when Doughty, 'circling end,
fumbled after he was tackled. An
Aggie player scooped up the baall and
ran fiil'teen yards toward the Stanford
goal line before he was tackled from
behind.
The visitors had their opportunity.
Kassberger, the star of the Aggies im
mediately resorted to the open game.
I One pass was good for a ten-yard gain
and put the ball on the ten-yard line.
The Cardinal line held for three
downs. The Aggies used a spread
formation. Kassberger shot a short
pass over the line of scrimmage to
Summers, who dashed over the goal.
McFadden kicked goal.
The Aggies had figured to win the
game. They were only tied. Five
minutes before the game was over,
Wilcox kicked over the goal line. The
visitors had first and ten on their own
twenty-yard line. On the first play
Kassberger called for a forward pass.
Patrick caught it and never stopped
until he was over the goal line. Wil
cox kicked goal.
McFadden kicked off to Doughty to
start the game. The Card half came
into his thirty-yard line before he
was dropped. An exchange of punts
followed, Stanford gaining the advant
age. Mertz recovered Kassberger's ;
fumble,' giving Stanford first down in
Aggie territory.
The visitors could not advance and i
kicked to Shlaudeman who returned
the ball 10 yards. He fumbled when he
was tackled but Mertz again recovered.
The Aggies intercepted a pass in mid- I
field and started an offense that look- 1
ed dangerous. A fifteen-yard penalty j
broke it up and Stanford got the
ball when a pass fell incomplete over I
the goal.
On the first play from the twenty
yard line, Art Wilcox went off tackle
for ten yards. Patrick added five and
Wilcox went over tackle for twenty.
A moment later he worked his way
through the same hole for twenty-five.
Patrick missed a try for a drop kick.
The Aggies kicked from their twen
ty-yard line and Shlaudeman ran it
back to midfield. Patrick went over
center for five, and a short pass,
Shlaudeman to Wilcox, was good for i
twelve. Wilcox reeled off fifteen
yards and the pass over the line to j
Mertz followed.
Ludeke kicked off over the goal line |
to start the second half. An Aggie
fumble gave Stanford first down on |
the visitors' twelve-yard mark. Mc-
Fadden, however, intercepted a for
ward pass and the Aggies kicked out
of danger.
Stanford was forced to kick and the
Aggies made yards twice before Sum
mers fumbled. On the next play
Doughty fumbled and the Aggies
started their offense that brought their
only score.
Crowell kicked off for the Aggies
and Stanford was unable to advance.
Wilcox sent a long punt down the
field that eluded Kassberger and
rolled to the Aggie ten-yard line. On
the next play Miller attempted to run
from a kick formation but was
thrown for a five-yard loss by Mertz.
The Aggies then kicked and Shlaude
man made the prettiest run of the
game, when he brought the ball back
forty yards to the visitors' ten-yard
mark.
The Aggies held for three downs and
Shlaudeman called a play similar to
the one that Mertz had scored on
earlier in the afternoon. Sproull was
free to catch the ball but the pass
was too short and fell incomplete over
the goal line.
The Aggres tried pass after pass but
few were successful. An exchange of
kicks followed, Wilcox booting over
the goal line.
From the twenty-yard line, Kass
berger tried a pass which Patrick in
tercepted and carried for a touch
down. That was all of the scoring.
In the next few minutes, the visitors
tried seven passes, two of which were
completed for short gains.

It was a case of a faster, cleverer organization, pitted against a heavier,
overconfident team that was not satisfied with a tie.
There was no fluke about Stanford's victory Saturday. The figures on
the stenographer's pad will vouch for thot. The breaks of the game were
evenly divided. Stanford took advantage of hers; the Aggies did not.
To Art Wilcox, whose work is never marked by anything save mechanical
precision, go the honors of the game; to Bob Shlaudeman, who appears so
calm and collected about everything he does, that one wonders if he really
could get excited on a football field if he tried, go more honors, and to Cap
tain Jack Patrick, who intercepted an Aggie pass and raced thirty yards
through a broken field to a touchdown that broke a 7-7 tie and gave victory
to Stanford, go still more.

Wilcox played the best game of his
career Saturday. His work was never
flashy but he followed his interference
perfectly and when once in the open
displayed the best knowledge of just
where to go that has been shown here
this season.
Shlaudeman's ability to run back
punts was nothing short of uncanny.
Time after time he would slip, swerve
and dodge down the field for long
runs; leaving in his wake half a dozen
Aggie tacklers.
He used splendid judgment in run
ning the team.
Stanford's victory means that the
Cards must be considered as a con
tender for the conference title and
that the title practically rests between
Van Gent's team and the University of
California. The Big Game will be
bigger than ever this year.
Van Gent's new play of using the
end out to come in and clip the op
posing tackle worked for big gains all
during the first lialf of the game. With
Wilcox running through large holes
for long gains, the Cards worked the
ball to the Aggies fifteen-yard mark.
All this time the end had been playing
out and coming into the line of scrim
mage.
It was here that Shlaudeman used
the "ace" play. Instead of coming
into the lie of play, "Shorty" Mertz
ran straight down the field, stepped
over the goal line and caught a per
fectly thrown pass from Shlaudeman
for the first score of the afternoon.
Wilcox kicked goal.
Stanford was bearing doAvn the
field near the close of the third quar
ter, when Doughty, 'circling end,
fumbled after he was tackled. An
Aggie player scooped up the baall and
ran fiil'teen yards toward the Stanford
goal line before he was tackled from
behind.
The visitors had their opportunity.
Kassberger, the star of the Aggies im
mediately resorted to the open game.
I One pass was good for a ten-yard gain
and put the ball on the ten-yard line.
The Cardinal line held for three
downs. The Aggies used a spread
formation. Kassberger shot a short
pass over the line of scrimmage to
Summers, who dashed over the goal.
McFadden kicked goal.
The Aggies had figured to win the
game. They were only tied. Five
minutes before the game was over,
Wilcox kicked over the goal line. The
visitors had first and ten on their own
twenty-yard line. On the first play
Kassberger called for a forward pass.
Patrick caught it and never stopped
until he was over the goal line. Wil
cox kicked goal.
McFadden kicked off to Doughty to
start the game. The Card half came
into his thirty-yard line before he
was dropped. An exchange of punts
followed, Stanford gaining the advant
age. Mertz recovered Kassberger's ;
fumble,' giving Stanford first down in
Aggie territory.
The visitors could not advance and i
kicked to Shlaudeman who returned
the ball 10 yards. He fumbled when he
was tackled but Mertz again recovered.
The Aggies intercepted a pass in mid- I
field and started an offense that look- 1
ed dangerous. A fifteen-yard penalty j
broke it up and Stanford got the
ball when a pass fell incomplete over I
the goal.
On the first play from the twenty
yard line, Art Wilcox went off tackle
for ten yards. Patrick added five and
Wilcox went over tackle for twenty.
A moment later he worked his way
through the same hole for twenty-five.
Patrick missed a try for a drop kick.
The Aggies kicked from their twen
ty-yard line and Shlaudeman ran it
back to midfield. Patrick went over
center for five, and a short pass,
Shlaudeman to Wilcox, was good for i
twelve. Wilcox reeled off fifteen
yards and the pass over the line to j
Mertz followed.
Ludeke kicked off over the goal line |
to start the second half. An Aggie
fumble gave Stanford first down on |
the visitors' twelve-yard mark. Mc-
Fadden, however, intercepted a for
ward pass and the Aggies kicked out
of danger.
Stanford was forced to kick and the
Aggies made yards twice before Sum
mers fumbled. On the next play
Doughty fumbled and the Aggies
started their offense that brought their
only score.
Crowell kicked off for the Aggies
and Stanford was unable to advance.
Wilcox sent a long punt down the
field that eluded Kassberger and
rolled to the Aggie ten-yard line. On
the next play Miller attempted to run
from a kick formation but was
thrown for a five-yard loss by Mertz.
The Aggies then kicked and Shlaude
man made the prettiest run of the
game, when he brought the ball back
forty yards to the visitors' ten-yard
mark.
The Aggies held for three downs and
Shlaudeman called a play similar to
the one that Mertz had scored on
earlier in the afternoon. Sproull was
free to catch the ball but the pass
was too short and fell incomplete over
the goal line.
The Aggres tried pass after pass but
few were successful. An exchange of
kicks followed, Wilcox booting over
the goal line.
From the twenty-yard line, Kass
berger tried a pass which Patrick in
tercepted and carried for a touch
down. That was all of the scoring.
In the next few minutes, the visitors
tried seven passes, two of which were

precision, go the honors of the game; to Bob Shlaudeman, who appears so
calm and collected about everything he does, that one wonders if he really
could get excited on a football field if he tried, go more honors, and to Cap
tain Jack Patrick, who intercepted an Aggie pass and raced thirty yards
through a broken field to a touchdown that broke a 7-7 tie and gave victory
to Stanford, go still more.

Wilcox played the best game of his
career Saturday. His work was never
flashy but he followed his interference
perfectly and when once in the open
displayed the best knowledge of just
where to go that has been shown here
this season.
Shlaudeman's ability to run back
punts was nothing short of uncanny.
Time after time he would slip, swerve
and dodge down the field for long
runs; leaving in his wake half a dozen
Aggie tacklers.
He used splendid judgment in run
ning the team.
Stanford's victory means that the
Cards must be considered as a con
tender for the conference title and
that the title practically rests between
Van Gent's team and the University of
California. The Big Game will be
bigger than ever this year.
Van Gent's new play of using the
end out to come in and clip the op
posing tackle worked for big gains all
during the first lialf of the game. With
Wilcox running through large holes
for long gains, the Cards worked the
ball to the Aggies fifteen-yard mark.
All this time the end had been playing
out and coming into the line of scrim
mage.
It was here that Shlaudeman used
the "ace" play. Instead of coming
into the lie of play, "Shorty" Mertz
ran straight down the field, stepped
over the goal line and caught a per
fectly thrown pass from Shlaudeman
for the first score of the afternoon.
Wilcox kicked goal.
Stanford was bearing doAvn the
field near the close of the third quar
ter, when Doughty, 'circling end,
fumbled after he was tackled. An
Aggie player scooped up the baall and
ran fiil'teen yards toward the Stanford
goal line before he was tackled from
behind.
The visitors had their opportunity.
Kassberger, the star of the Aggies im
mediately resorted to the open game.
I One pass was good for a ten-yard gain
and put the ball on the ten-yard line.
The Cardinal line held for three
downs. The Aggies used a spread
formation. Kassberger shot a short
pass over the line of scrimmage to
Summers, who dashed over the goal.
McFadden kicked goal.
The Aggies had figured to win the
game. They were only tied. Five
minutes before the game was over,
Wilcox kicked over the goal line. The
visitors had first and ten on their own
twenty-yard line. On the first play
Kassberger called for a forward pass.
Patrick caught it and never stopped
until he was over the goal line. Wil
cox kicked goal.
McFadden kicked off to Doughty to
start the game. The Card half came
into his thirty-yard line before he
was dropped. An exchange of punts
followed, Stanford gaining the advant
age. Mertz recovered Kassberger's ;
fumble,' giving Stanford first down in
Aggie territory.
The visitors could not advance and i
kicked to Shlaudeman who returned
the ball 10 yards. He fumbled when he
was tackled but Mertz again recovered.
The Aggies intercepted a pass in mid- I
field and started an offense that look- 1
ed dangerous. A fifteen-yard penalty j
broke it up and Stanford got the
ball when a pass fell incomplete over I
the goal.
On the first play from the twenty
yard line, Art Wilcox went off tackle
for ten yards. Patrick added five and
Wilcox went over tackle for twenty.
A moment later he worked his way
through the same hole for twenty-five.
Patrick missed a try for a drop kick.
The Aggies kicked from their twen
ty-yard line and Shlaudeman ran it
back to midfield. Patrick went over
center for five, and a short pass,
Shlaudeman to Wilcox, was good for i
twelve. Wilcox reeled off fifteen
yards and the pass over the line to j
Mertz followed.
Ludeke kicked off over the goal line |
to start the second half. An Aggie
fumble gave Stanford first down on |
the visitors' twelve-yard mark. Mc-
Fadden, however, intercepted a for
ward pass and the Aggies kicked out
of danger.
Stanford was forced to kick and the
Aggies made yards twice before Sum
mers fumbled. On the next play
Doughty fumbled and the Aggies
started their offense that brought their
only score.
Crowell kicked off for the Aggies
and Stanford was unable to advance.
Wilcox sent a long punt down the
field that eluded Kassberger and
rolled to the Aggie ten-yard line. On
the next play Miller attempted to run
from a kick formation but was
thrown for a five-yard loss by Mertz.
The Aggies then kicked and Shlaude
man made the prettiest run of the
game, when he brought the ball back
forty yards to the visitors' ten-yard
mark.
The Aggies held for three downs and
Shlaudeman called a play similar to
the one that Mertz had scored on
earlier in the afternoon. Sproull was
free to catch the ball but the pass
was too short and fell incomplete over
the goal line.
The Aggres tried pass after pass but
few were successful. An exchange of
kicks followed, Wilcox booting over
the goal line.
From the twenty-yard line, Kass
berger tried a pass which Patrick in
tercepted and carried for a touch
down. That was all of the scoring.
In the next few minutes, the visitors
tried seven passes, two of which were

I7OR THE SECOND TIME in two years, Stanford, doped to be beaten, has
repelled the invasion of a northern football team.
The Cardinal is today tied for the lead in the Pacific Coast Conference
by virtue of defeating the Oregon Aggies, 14 to 7, here Saturday.

overconfident team that was not satisfied with a tie.

career Saturday. His work was never
flashy but he followed his interference
perfectly and when once in the open
displayed the best knowledge of just
where to go that has been shown here
this season.
Shlaudeman's ability to run back
punts was nothing short of uncanny.
Time after time he would slip, swerve
and dodge down the field for long
runs; leaving in his wake half a dozen
Aggie tacklers.
He used splendid judgment in run
ning the team.
Stanford's victory means that the
Cards must be considered as a con
tender for the conference title and
that the title practically rests between
Van Gent's team and the University of
California. The Big Game will be
bigger than ever this year.
Van Gent's new play of using the
end out to come in and clip the op
posing tackle worked for big gains all
during the first lialf of the game. With
Wilcox running through large holes
for long gains, the Cards worked the
ball to the Aggies fifteen-yard mark.
All this time the end had been playing
out and coming into the line of scrim
mage.
It was here that Shlaudeman used
the "ace" play. Instead of coming
into the lie of play, "Shorty" Mertz
ran straight down the field, stepped
over the goal line and caught a per
fectly thrown pass from Shlaudeman
for the first score of the afternoon.
Wilcox kicked goal.
Stanford was bearing doAvn the
field near the close of the third quar
ter, when Doughty, 'circling end,
fumbled after he was tackled. An
Aggie player scooped up the baall and
ran fiil'teen yards toward the Stanford
goal line before he was tackled from
behind.
The visitors had their opportunity.
Kassberger, the star of the Aggies im
mediately resorted to the open game.
I One pass was good for a ten-yard gain
and put the ball on the ten-yard line.
The Cardinal line held for three
downs. The Aggies used a spread
formation. Kassberger shot a short
pass over the line of scrimmage to
Summers, who dashed over the goal.
McFadden kicked goal.
The Aggies had figured to win the
game. They were only tied. Five
minutes before the game was over,
Wilcox kicked over the goal line. The
visitors had first and ten on their own
twenty-yard line. On the first play
Kassberger called for a forward pass.
Patrick caught it and never stopped
until he was over the goal line. Wil
cox kicked goal.
McFadden kicked off to Doughty to
start the game. The Card half came
into his thirty-yard line before he
was dropped. An exchange of punts
followed, Stanford gaining the advant
age. Mertz recovered Kassberger's ;
fumble,' giving Stanford first down in
Aggie territory.
The visitors could not advance and i
kicked to Shlaudeman who returned
the ball 10 yards. He fumbled when he
was tackled but Mertz again recovered.
The Aggies intercepted a pass in mid- I
field and started an offense that look- 1
ed dangerous. A fifteen-yard penalty j
broke it up and Stanford got the
ball when a pass fell incomplete over I
the goal.
On the first play from the twenty
yard line, Art Wilcox went off tackle
for ten yards. Patrick added five and
Wilcox went over tackle for twenty.
A moment later he worked his way
through the same hole for twenty-five.
Patrick missed a try for a drop kick.
The Aggies kicked from their twen
ty-yard line and Shlaudeman ran it
back to midfield. Patrick went over
center for five, and a short pass,
Shlaudeman to Wilcox, was good for i
twelve. Wilcox reeled off fifteen
yards and the pass over the line to j
Mertz followed.
Ludeke kicked off over the goal line |
to start the second half. An Aggie
fumble gave Stanford first down on |
the visitors' twelve-yard mark. Mc-
Fadden, however, intercepted a for
ward pass and the Aggies kicked out
of danger.
Stanford was forced to kick and the
Aggies made yards twice before Sum
mers fumbled. On the next play
Doughty fumbled and the Aggies
started their offense that brought their
only score.
Crowell kicked off for the Aggies
and Stanford was unable to advance.
Wilcox sent a long punt down the
field that eluded Kassberger and
rolled to the Aggie ten-yard line. On
the next play Miller attempted to run
from a kick formation but was
thrown for a five-yard loss by Mertz.
The Aggies then kicked and Shlaude
man made the prettiest run of the
game, when he brought the ball back
forty yards to the visitors' ten-yard
mark.
The Aggies held for three downs and
Shlaudeman called a play similar to
the one that Mertz had scored on
earlier in the afternoon. Sproull was
free to catch the ball but the pass
was too short and fell incomplete over
the goal line.
The Aggres tried pass after pass but
few were successful. An exchange of
kicks followed, Wilcox booting over
the goal line.
From the twenty-yard line, Kass
berger tried a pass which Patrick in
tercepted and carried for a touch
down. That was all of the scoring.
In the next few minutes, the visitors
tried seven passes, two of which were
completed for short gains.
