# VARSITY GRIDMEN UPSET DOPE BY BEATING AGGIES, 14-7
## VICTORY TIES STANFORD TEAM WITH CALIFORNIA FOR CONFERENCE LEAD Wilcox, Patrick and Shlaudeman Star in Game Here Saturday 
### (By E. C. West, '23 
I7OR THE SECOND TIME in two years, Stanford, doped to be beaten, has
repelled the invasion of a northern football team.
The Cardinal is today tied for the lead in the Pacific Coast Conference
by virtue of defeating the Oregon Aggies, 14 to 7, here Saturday.
It was a case of a faster, cleverer organization, pitted against a heavier,
overconfident team that was not satisfied with a tie.
There was no fluke about Stanford's victory Saturday. The figures on
the stenographer's pad will vouch for thot. The breaks of the game were
evenly divided. Stanford took advantage of hers; the Aggies did not.
To Art Wilcox, whose work is never marked by anything save mechanical
precision, go the honors of the game; to Bob Shlaudeman, who appears so
calm and collected about everything he does, that one wonders if he really
could get excited on a football field if he tried, go more honors, and to Cap
tain Jack Patrick, who intercepted an Aggie pass and raced thirty yards
through a broken field to a touchdown that broke a 7-7 tie and gave victory
to Stanford, go still more.

Wilcox played the best game of his
career Saturday. His work was never
flashy but he followed his interference
perfectly and when once in the open
displayed the best knowledge of just
where to go that has been shown here
this season.
Shlaudeman's ability to run back
punts was nothing short of uncanny.
Time after time he would slip, swerve
and dodge down the field for long
runs; leaving in his wake half a dozen
Aggie tacklers.
He used splendid judgment in run
ning the team.
Stanford's victory means that the
Cards must be considered as a con
tender for the conference title and
that the title practically rests between
Van Gent's team and the University of
California. The Big Game will be
bigger than ever this year.
Van Gent's new play of using the
end out to come in and clip the op
posing tackle worked for big gains all
during the first lialf of the game. With
Wilcox running through large holes
for long gains, the Cards worked the
ball to the Aggies fifteen-yard mark.
All this time the end had been playing
out and coming into the line of scrim
mage.
It was here that Shlaudeman used
the "ace" play. Instead of coming
into the lie of play, "Shorty" Mertz
ran straight down the field, stepped
over the goal line and caught a per
fectly thrown pass from Shlaudeman
for the first score of the afternoon.
Wilcox kicked goal.
Stanford was bearing doAvn the
