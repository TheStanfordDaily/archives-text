# WOMEN'S CONFERENCE AT U. C. IS DUE FOR BIG REPRESENTATION
## 
### 
Fifty-six universities west of the
Mississippi will be represented at the
Women's Intercollegiate Conference,
which will he represented oil the cam
pus of the University of California from
November 7 to 10. This is not an ath
letic convention, but a gathering at
which all the problems which women
find both in co-educational and other
universities, are to be considered and
discussed. It is the plan of the con
ference to have a convention every
year, meeting each time at a different
university. Last year the conference
was at Washington State College in
Pullman, Washington, and was the first
of its kind to be held.
A conference of the deans of women
of the universities concerned is to be
held in Berkeley at the same time. In
all, there will be some four hundred
women present, although they will not
all be voting delegates.
On Monday, November 7, Prytanean,
the senior women's honor society at
California, will entertain the represen
tatives at dinner. President and Mrs.
Barrows have announced a reception to
all the visiting women on Wednesday
afternoon, to be held at their home on
the University grounds. That night
there will be a banquet given at the
Claremolit Country Club by the Asso
ciated Women Students of the Univer
sity.
Hearst hall, the women's gymnasium,
will be the scene of the final dinner of
the conference to be given by the
Women's Athletic Association. Follow
ing the banquet, the entire convention
is to attend the annual Pajamarino rally
which will be held that night in the
Greek theater. A dance in the gymna
sium after the rally will end the ac
tivities of the convention.
