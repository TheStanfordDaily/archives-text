# LINCOLN HIGH SQUAD TO CLASH WITH BABES
## 
### 
Lincoln High of Los Angeles will be
the next prep school to send an eleven
against Coach Seay's gridmen. The
teams will meet on the local turf at
1:30 p. mâ€ž Saturday.
At the beginning of the season, Lin
coln High had all the markings of a
strong eleven and carried everything be
fore them. In the past few weeks the
Jinx has pursued them and, although
they now claim to have shaken him, the
strength of the eleven which meets the
Seayites will be an unknown quantity.
Last evening Coach Seay ran his men
through some formation and signal
practice in preparation for a scrimmage
with the varsity this afternoon. The
plucky yearlings have shown up well
every time they have met Van Gent's
men and, with the noticeable improve
ment of the last week, they should give
the varsity some stubborn opposition.
From the way Howard and Harman
showed up in last Saturday's game it
would seem that the question before the
freshmen coaches is not, who to put on
the first-string lineup, but who to keep
off from it.
Wheat took the quarter back position
Saturday and directed the play with the
judgment and ease of a veteran. Den
nis, at right half, made many of the
sensational runs of the game and kicked
most of the field goals. He is a lighter
from the word go, and is the type of
first-year man who insures a winning
varsity in the future.
Gilliland, the low-charging back from
Arizona, is the best yard-gainer on the
squad, and has stood out as an artist at
the game from his first donning of the
striped jersey. Cuddeback, with his re
liable kicking and ability to hit the line,
is the logical man for his position at
fullback.
Following the freshman grid game
Saturday, the varsity soccer team will
play the Olympic Club, the contest
starting at 3 o'clock.
