# HIRST TALKS OF ENGLISH POLITICS AND LLOYD GEORGE
## 
### 
"Regardless of what may he said on
the matter, a single personality altered
the course of history," declared Pro
fessor Francis W. Hirst, Monday after
noon, speaking in the Little Theater, on
the subject of "Lloyd George and the
L'beral Party." If peace had been de
clared in 1916, lie continued, the map
of Europe would not have been changed,
and two-thirds of the bloodshed as well
as many of today's economic conditions
would have been avoided.
Professor Hirst, who is delivering a
series of lectures under the auspices of
the Political Science Department, gave
a historical sketch of Lloyd George and
the Liberal Party last Monday, as a
preparatory topic to his future subject,
the "Irish Question." It would be diffi
cult to understand the political position
Lloyd George occupies without a knowl
edge of his relations to the Liberal
Party, as chancellor of the exchequer in
1908, and minister of munitions in 1916
Born in a poor home of the moun
tainous regions of Wales, and without
pretense of college education, Profes
sor Tlirst stated, Lloyd George began
his career in provincial law and police
courts, as a defender of urchins and
impoverished farmers against an un
sympathetic society. In those days the
great question was, "Do you go to
chapel or to church?" according to
whether one was a Liberal or a Con
servative. As a Liberal, Lloyd George
followed Chamberlain's radical program
of 1884. of temperance reform and the
disestablishment of the Anglican church.
As an opponent of the Boer War, be

lieving it to have been undertaken in the
interests of prospectors and the gold
mine section of the stock exchange, Pro
fessor Hirst pictured Lloyd George as
a bitter foe of the Chamberlain family.
Once, in speaking of their industrial
enterprises, he was said to have ex
claimed, "The empire must expand for
the Chamberlain family to contract."
And when Chamberlain, after the war
in 1902, tried to alleviate trade difficul
ties by a tariff reform, the policy of
dearer food and clothing did not appeal
to the nation, and Sir Henry Campbell
Bannerman and Lloyd George became
popular figures. At the death of Ban
nerman in 1908, Lloyd George rose from
president of the Board of Trade to
chancellor of the exchequer, with a pro
gram of peace, non-extension of arms,
and a people's budget.
"It is certain," said Professor Tlirst.
"that Lloyd George opposed the policy
of entering the war with France until
German troops had reached Luxem
burg. "After that time," he continued.
"Lloyd George became the champion of
liberty."
While minister of munitions, Lloyd
George spent money like water, though
no one expected the war to last ntor?
than six months, Professor Hirst said.
Russia, pictured by Winston Churchill
as a steam roller, seems to have worked
backwards, proving nearly fatal to those
countries in her path. But to assume
the point of the optimist, he favors the
rule of Terrensky to the corrupt reign
of the Czars.
