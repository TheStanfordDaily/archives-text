# WASHINGTON IS NEXT ON CARD'S GRID SCHEDULE
## Harley Carter Is on Injured List After Hard Encounter With Invaders from Oregon 
### 
With what appears to be the hard
est game of the season until the big
fray with California, on November 19,
out of the way, the Stanford football
coaches last night began drilling their
varsity players for two intervening
battles.
The University of Washington set
is next on the Stanford schedule, and
according to all dope Van Gent's
henchmen should find little difficulty
in eliminating the northerners next
Saturday, in the big Seattle stadium.
The Oregon Aggies are back at Cor
vallis, practically out of the confer
ence struggle by reason of their 14 to
7 defeat here. But they left behind a
reputation as a fighting and 'hard
playing outfit.
Washington fell before the Aggies
two weeks ago, 24 to 0. Since Stan
ford trimmed the Aggies, comparative
scores would indicate that the Cardi
nals should win easily. But dope counts
less in football than in any other
sport.
The Sun Dodgers attribute their de
feat to the Aggies as a result of play
ing on the slow sawdust field at Cor
vallis. Whether that is true or not
remains to be seen.
Stanford will have to play on Wash
ington's own field before a hostile
crowd. It is known to rain a great
deal about this time a year up north
and the Cardinals will be at a disad
vantage on a wet field. The game
with the Pacific Fleet proved that.
The Stanford mentors are not going
to take a chance. They will use their
full strength against Washington.
The varsity practiced behind closed
gates last night and repeated again
tonight. Wednesday night will be
"bleacher day" with the Stanford
rooters scheduled to give the men
a send-off. The varsity squad will
leave Palo Alto Wednesday night for
Seattle. Van Gent will take approxi
mately 22 men north, it is said.
For the most part the Card forces
are in good sh,ape after the hard
Aggie game. Harley Carter, the big
tackle, who stood out Saturday as a
tower of strength, has a bad knee and
will probably be unable to play Sat
urday. The Card coaches may even
keep him out of the fray until the
Big Game as he is too valuable a
man to lose at this point in the sea
son.
