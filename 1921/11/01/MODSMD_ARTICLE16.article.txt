# The 						Send-Off Rally
## 
### 
The Cardinal Varsity, led by Coach Gene Van
Gent, leaves tomorrow night to invade the domain
of the University of Washington, where Stanford's
second conference game will be played. For this
reason the inauguration of the custom of "Bleacher
Day" set for Thursday will be held on Wednesday
afternoon.
This first get-together of the team's supporters
will mean much more than it ordinarily would. It
will be in the nature of a .send-off to the football
eleven. We will have an opportunity to show the
team that we will be with them in spirit although we
can not all accompany them to Seattle.
Skull and Snakes Society has made an organized
drive, urging members of all organizations to turn
out in force to these weekly gatherings on the bleach
ers. The movement instigated last week by this so
ciety received a powerful impetus as a result of last
Saturday's victory over ()regon's "Fighting Aggies."
Tomorrow Stanford students will manifest more of
the spirit that was so much in evidence at the last
game by filling the bleachers for the final varsity
workout of the week.
