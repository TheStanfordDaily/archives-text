# Student Opinion.

### 
There are times during every school year when
certain phases of student activity or changes in the
routine of this institution bring forth criticism from
members of the undergraduate body. Thus far this
year the Daily has had but few letters expressing the
viewpoints of students. This made indicate several
things.
The obvious conclusion is that almost everyone is
satisfied with the way things are going. Evidently
there is no criticism of the conduct of athletics, the
workings of student government, the findings of
the Men's Council in regard to infractions of the
Honor System, and the myriad of other things that
have aroused the ire of students during the past.
On the other side the absence of criticism may
indicate complete lethargy on the part of the stu
dent body. It may be that they have no interests
other than personal, and since their personal liber
ties have not been interfered with they are content to
maintain silence.
Let us hope that the first is true. One month has
passed and there has been 110 serious dissension
among the students upon any question.
Obviously, criticism does not have to be destruc
tive in order to merit publication. There is always
a column open in the Daily for communications from
students. All that is necessary to guarantee publi
cation is that such communications be based 011 live
topics of general student interest, and that they bear
the name of the writer. The writer's name is not
printed if it is specifically requested, but it must be
known to the editor in order that he may be pro
tected.
