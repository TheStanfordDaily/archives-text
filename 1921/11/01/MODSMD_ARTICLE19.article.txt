Good For a Starter
There was a young fellow named Carter,
Who we must confess is a martyr;
While running a race,
He fell on his face,
And hollered, "I've busied my garter!"

Rah! Rah! Rah! Go tell your ma,
That prices will surely come down;
Some in lumps,
And some by jumps,
But never in this man's town.

Outside of that old one about "wit" which is but
a gnat in the soup, we strain at bear. The administra

A Slick Story
Young Rodney was a millionaire,
His wealth came not from toil,
He made and lost a fortune
When he watered stock with oil.
He one time was a farmer.
And the water in his well,
Accumulated gas and grease;
Of that I have to tell.
- . T«H.
By drinking from the greasy tank,
His stock grew fat and sleek,
They yielded so much butter-fat,
He milked them once a week.
His Ford he filled with water,
Which he filtered through a screen,
And the oil that floated on the top,
He used for gasoline.
The eggs his chickens laid were great,
Men sought them everywhere,
Those eggs were full of axle grease,
All others got the air.
His. land was worth a wondrous price,
With neither debt nor lease.
His stock were full of ginger once,
But now they're full of grease.
Now Rodney was a stingy man,
He didn't have to beg,
But for the jack he killed the goose
That laid the golden egg;
And he himself went with the goose
He blasted out the well.
He threw in too much dynamite,
And now he's gone to —Berkeley.

Old Mother Hubbard wen to the cupboard.
To get her poor freshman a pin,
But while she was gone, a brother came on,
And somebody got taken in.

Well Cabbages has done its part. How's Things?
