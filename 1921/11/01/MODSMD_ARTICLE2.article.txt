# STANFORD WILL HONOR DANTE SEXCENTENNIAL
## Dr. O. M. Johnston, Dr. Bassett and Dr. Aurelia Reinhardt to Speak at Stanford 
### 
Stanford will celebrate the Dante
Sexcentennial with a program in the As
sembly Hall tonight at 8 o'clock. Sep
tember 14th, was the six hundredth an
niversary of the death of the Italian
poet. Since that date was not conven
ient for most schools and colleges to
pay their tributes, celebrations in honor
of Dante are being held at various times
during the autumn in the different in
stitutions of learning in America.
In Ttaly, preparations for the Sexcen
tenary have been under way for several
years. One of the principle projects has
been to restore to its former glory the
church of San Francesco, at Ravenna,
in which the tomb of Dante is located.
A students' tour of Ttaly, under the
auspices of the Italy-America Society,
has been arranged to give the students
of Dante a chance to visit places of spe
cial interest connected with the life and
writings of the poet.
Dr. Oliver Johnston will preside at
the celebration and will speak on "Dante
After Six Hundred Years." Dr. Johns
ton is a member of the National Dante
Committee, and gives university courses
in Dante. Dr. Bassett, of the English
Department, will give readings from
several cantos of the "Divine Comedy."
He will use the translation on which
Dr. Melville Anderson, professor emeri
tus of Stanford, has been working for
twenty years and has recently com
pleted. As this work lias not yet been
published. Dr. Bassett will read from
the manuscript.
Dr. Aurelia Henry Reinhardt, presi
dent of Mills College, will talk on the
"Political Philosophy of Dante." Dr.
Reinhardt worked on this subject for
her degree of Doctor of Philosophy.
Warren D. Allen, the university or
ganist, has charge of the musical por
tion of the program. Surprisingly few
musical works, according to Allen, have
been inspired by Dante, possibly because
of poetry of Dante is itself so inher
ently musical. Mrs. Elsie Cook Hughes
will play a Listz sonata. Redfield Scars,
baritone, will sing two sonnets from
Wolf-Ferrari's oratorio, "The New
Life," using the Dante text.
