# Games Coming Slow For Rugby Schedule; Trip North Is Sure
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity rugby team is
progressing in fine shape for this early
in the season. With ten of last year's
team hack and a squad of from thirty
to forty aspirants for the remaining po
sitions, it can he seen that rugby should
turn out to be a successful sport this
year.
The rugby manager finds himself in
an unfortunate situation in the matter
of practice games. Most of the high
schools and colleges around the bay
have discontinued playing rugby in fa
vor of the American football. This
makes it hard to work out a supplemen
tary schedule for the team before the
real season commences. However, with
such a large squad, there promises to be
a great deal of material for play among
the locals and these scrimmages, to
gether with a few games that have been
secured with clubs that still stick to
rugby, should put the team in fine shape
for the contemplated northern trip t.'iis
winter.
The only game that has been definitely
scheduled here is that with Woodlands
on November 25. Overtures have been
made for dates with the Olympic and
Barbarian Clubs of San Francisco. There
will be no rugby game with California
this year. This leaves Stanford the only
southern contender for the world trophy,
to be given away at Vancouver this
year.
The northern tour will take place dur
ing Christmas vacation. On this trip
the Stanford team will play four games,
three in Vancouver and one in Vic
toria, British Columbia. The first game
of the series will be played on Christmas
day against the University of British Co
lumbia. This will be followed by a game
with the Yacht Club of Vancouver. On
the second of January the scene will
shift to Victoria, where the Cards will
clash with a crack Victorian team not
yet picked.
