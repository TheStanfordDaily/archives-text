fellowmen. He was a friend of learn
ing, but first of all he was a friend of
those who pursue learning. There is
scarcely a member of the Association
who has not experienced .his help—his
kindly criticism or his encouraging
counsel. He, himself endowed with a
mind of creative power, pursued learn
ing with rare devotion. In it he found
joy for his own life and to others he set
an inspiring example. George Hempl
was more than a scholar. He was a
good man in those essential relations
of life which take precedence of schol
arship. We have all known his friend
ship. and now that he is no longer
among us, we mourn for him and cher
ish his memory."
