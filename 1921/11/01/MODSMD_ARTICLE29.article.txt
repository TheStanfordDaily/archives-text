# BUILDING OF BONFIRE TO START THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Work on the boniire to be located
back of Encina will probably start No
vember 2. Plans were for an earlier
start, but the desire of the wearers of
white hats to have a carefully prepared
list of all freshman doing duty, delayed
arrangements.
Charles Beardsley is in charge of the
freshman plans. He and sixteen assist
ants will be out to see that every first
year man works his twenty-one hours.
Shirkers will be reported to the class
of '24.
