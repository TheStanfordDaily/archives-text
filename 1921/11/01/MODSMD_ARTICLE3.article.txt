# EVERY TICKET WILL BE SOLD FOR GAME SAYS J. E. M'DOWELL
##

"Present indications are that every
ticket for the Big Game will be sold,"
said J. E. McDowell, alumni secre
tary, as he sat in his office this morn
ing, surrounded by heaps of applica
tions which were visible evidence of
the demand for the precious paste
boards.
In spite of the fact that there will
be several thousand more seats avail
able at the game this year than there
ever has been before, the demand
seems to have increased in proportion.
Though the stated time for the re
ception of students' applications for
seats has elapsed, this does not mean
that applications will not be taken,
but only applications from the general
public are als obeing received. Mr.
McDowell will file applications as long
as there are any vacancies in the
stand.
