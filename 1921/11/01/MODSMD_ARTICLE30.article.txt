# MANY ENROLLED IN STANFORD UNIT OF FIELD ARTILLERY
## 
### 
One hundred and thirty Stanford men
are now enrolled in the Stanford R. O.
T. C. unit, according to Major Collins,
head of the department of Military
Training and Tactics. Of these, ninety
are in their first two years of the course,
while the remaining number are en
rolled in the advanced and more tech
nical studies and activities of the de
partment. Many in this latter group will
qualify for commissions as second lieu
tenants in the reserve corps upon com
pletion of their college careers.
There has been a steady gain in the
enrollment for military, an increase of
about 33'/3 per cent being noted each
term, says Major Collins. This is re
garded as encouraging, since all enroll
ments in the R. O. T. C. at Stanford
are voluntary, as opposed to the com
pulsory two years' training at Califor
nia, and other state ,and land grant
colleges.
Aside from regular courses, the prin
cipal activity which is being fostered at
the present time among the R. O. T. C.
men is polo. Four enthusiastic teams
are on the field, and Major Collins is
certain that games with other universi
ties can be arranged. A cavalry unit has
been inaugurated at the University of
California, and there is already a field
artillery unit at the Oregon Agricul
tural College. Horseman from these
groups may be able to form a polo
league which will eventually expand,
taking in all of the major coast colleges.
