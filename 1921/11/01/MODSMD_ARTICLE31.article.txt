# Are Gallery Exhibits Australian Paintings

### 
The exhibition now at the Thomas
Welton Stanford Art Gallery is a col
lection, of fifty-six paintings recently ar
rived from Meloburne, Australia. These
paintings, from Thomas Welton Stan
ford's personal collection are interesting
in that they are all the work of one art
ist, J. W. Curtis, a painter well known
in Australia. The display opened yes
terday and will continue until Novem
ber 28.
Mr. T. W. Stanford, the donor of the
art gallery and the library, made his
home in Australia for several years.
While here, he collected paintings and
established funds for the Stanford Art
Gallery. The war and the death of Mr.
Stanford prevented the arrival of any
of the paintings until the present date.
Thomas Welton Stanford became in
terested in the work of J. W. .Curtis
through his portraiture of Australian
scenery and made arrangements where
by he purchased practically the entire
work of the artist. Mr. Stanford also
commissioned Curtis to paint scenes that
especially appealed to him in his jour
ney through Australia.
The largest room in the art gallery
includes only oil paintings. The second
gallery contains water color paintings,
and the third room has a display of
monochromatic water colors.
The exhibition is of as much import
ance geographically as from an artistic
standpoint. The pictures include real
istic portrayal of scenes varying from
high mountains to rugged coast, show
ing fires and storms.
