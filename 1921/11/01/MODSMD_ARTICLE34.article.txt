# STANFORD CLINICS TO LAUNCH FUND DRIVE
## 
### 
Efforts to raise funds for the work
of the auxiliary clinics and maternity
ward of the Stanford Medical School
in San Francisco, were launched yester
day when a drive was started to raise
$10,000 by means of a card and stamp
sale throughout the stores of San Fran
cisco.
The work of the clinic consists in giv
ing regular examinations to babies reg
istered at the ward and to give medical
care there when necessary. When the
parents are unable to buy milk, it is sup
plied free through the cooperation of
other social agencies. In addition to the
care of the babies, there are conducted
clinics for women and children, a gen
eral clinic, and a skin clinic. About 700
persons are cared for every month in
the various departments. It is from
here that the children are sent down to
the Convalescent Home on the campus.
Funds for this work are raised every
year through the sale of Christmas
cards by members of the Stanford Clin
ics Auxiliary, of which Mrs. Timothy is
now president. Last year over $6,000
was raised, but the increased quota of
$10,000 was made necessary by a widen
ing in the scope of the work, and the
need for greater aid, not only in the
line of medicines and medical attention,
but in the establishment of loan funds
and other measures of relief.
The general card sale drive, which
will open in all of the downtown mer
chandise stores on December 1, is to be
preceded by the establishment of a table
in the White House today. Here will
be sold, not only the boxes of Christmas
cards, but seals and stickers as well.
This table will be maintained every day
until Christmas.
