# UNUSUAL PICTURES IN COMING ISSUE OF STANFORD PICTORIAL
## 
### 
The feature of the Big Game num
ber of the Pictorial will be the cover
design, which is a birds-eye view of
Stanford's new stadium, taken from
an aeroplane. A1 Carey braved the
dangers of the air in the "Stanford"
plane to secure the first aeroplane
view of the bowl for the Pictorial.
The picture, which is reputed as the
best taken on ground or above, also
shows the other athletic fields and the
city of Palo Alto. The art designing
on the cover is the work of Ed
Farmer, art editor of the 1923 Quad.
The first page of the illustrated sec
tion will represent "Who's Who on
the Campus," with photographs of
persons most active in student af
fairs.
C. S. Draper has secured some rapid
fire pictures of the varsity in action
against the Marines and Olympics.
These pictures, which cover two pages,
show Douglas in the act of blocking
a punt, Art Wilcox nabbjng a for
ward pass, while several feet in the
ai v jc, and Bob Shlaudeman, Patrick,
Doughty, and other members of the
team in fighting form. The last page
of the pictorial section is taken up by
pictures of >the freshman team in
action, and by pictures of the sopho
more-freshman paint struggle.
