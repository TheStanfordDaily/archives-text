# UNION ROOF TILING FINISHED ON WINGS
## Work is Pushed on Interior of Structure; Inside Court Will Be Made Beauty Spot 
### 
Tiles on the two wings and the
rear of the Stanford Union are prac
tically all set in place, and the build
ing is rapidly assuming its permanent
aspect. With the completion of the
Union roof, the crew will move at
once to the basketball pavilion, with
the aim of having the tile work on
both structures finished in time for
the Big Game.
Work on the interior is progressing
rapidly. The plastering is finished in
the main dining hall and the smaller
west dining room. A plaster cornice
has been set in place in the west
room. Work is being pushed on the
installation of the refrigerating plant,
and the wiring and plumbing have
been completed. Work was going for
ward today towards connecting the
building with the main pipe line paral
leling the car tracks.
Plans prepared for the planting of
the inner court aim at making this
area one of the show places of the
campus. The largfe wisteria vines
grew over the foot
ball "bleachers will be planted about
the sides. These plants, which are
/three to four inches in diameter at the
base, were taken up and potted when
the bleachers were taken down, and
have been kept in good condition for
this purpose. They will be trained
over the arches, giving the whole
court an appearance of older construc
tion.
