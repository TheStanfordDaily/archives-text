by the yell leaders for all women root
ers. Additional copies of the Stanford
songs will be given out to all those
who did not receive them at the foot
ball game last Saturday afternoon.

be resorted to Wednesday in order to
encourage everyone to show his best
type of rooting. This was tried with
great success last year and may be
used again. If it is, half the crowd
will be placed on one side of the field
and half on the other side, with both
sides striving to out-do the other in
the art of cheering.
Skull and Snakes Society asks that
all block "S" men, and all men who
have numeral sweaters, wear their
sweaters on Wednesday.
