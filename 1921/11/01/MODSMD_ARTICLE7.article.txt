## "On the Boat" Assembly Hears Speeches an Traditions and Customs Here 
### 
"Every student must do something
for Stanford. Somewhere there is a
job with a Stanford tag and a student's
name on it. It is the duty of the stu
dent to find it." Thus Professor "Bill"
Owens of the Law Department, Stan
ford's youngest professor, told the fresh
men what is expected of them and what
their opportunities are, at the third of
the "011 .the boat" assemblies, held last
night in the Assembly Hall.
"Stanford Customs and Traditions"
was the principal topic of the assembly,
at which four speakers addressed the
freshmen. These talks, as have been
the former two held this quarter, were
given under the auspices of the Y. M.
C. A., Y. W. C. A. and Associated Stu
dents. Ross Fisher, '21, chairman of the
Y. M. C. A. committee on freshman
assemblies, presided.
Professor Owens spoke on "Traditions
and Customs of the Past," mentioned
how the first Cardinal rugby squad won
from California against heavy odds,
when the type of football was switched
suddenly from American to rugbf. He
spoke on the importance of keeping alive
enthusiasm for Stanford, not neces
sarily by arm-waving and loud shouts,
but by earnest work and plenty of snap.
"Stanford spirit boosts something con
structive," he said; "find out what's to
be done, and let's say, 'Go to it!'"
,"Red" Aubert, president of the Men's
Council, spoke on the Honor System
and the special importance of freshmen
adhering strictly to it. "The freshmen
must take hold of the Honor System
and pass it on to future classes," he
declared, and told the '25 men how the
idea came from the students themselves,
how the Geology, Law and Engineering
Departments had used it successfully
for some time before the whole univer
sity adopted it, and how the cards pledg
ing adherence to the spirit of the enter
prise were signed unanimously by the
whole student body.
Mark Evans, varsity boxer, and mem
ber of the Circle "S" Society, delivered
a talk on "Minor Sports." He told of
the past successes of the Cardinal mi
nor sports, and of the high expectations
for the future.
R. C. Wohlford, '18, ex-editor of
Chaparral and the 1918 Quad, had as
his subject, "Stanford Customs of To
day." "There are very strong reasons
for the customs here today; they are
the things that distinguish Stanford
from other universities," he said; "the
personnel of the school changes, but the
traditions remain. All customs have pur
poses and should be observed." He
mentioned the "Hello" custom, the
roughing privilege, and spoke on the
necessity and reasons for the wearing
of "dinks" by all freshmen. Getting into
activities, absence of factional disputes,
and other essential matters were men
tioned by Wohlford in the course of
his speech.

poses and should be observed." He
mentioned the "Hello" custom, the
roughing privilege, and spoke on the
necessity and reasons for the wearing
of "dinks" by all freshmen. Getting into
activities, absence of factional disputes,
and other essential matters were men
tioned by Wohlford in the course of
his speech.
"Every student must do something
for Stanford. Somewhere there is a
job with a Stanford tag and a student's
name on it. It is the duty of the stu
dent to find it." Thus Professor "Bill"
Owens of the Law Department, Stan
ford's youngest professor, told the fresh
men what is expected of them and what
their opportunities are, at the third of
the "011 .the boat" assemblies, held last
night in the Assembly Hall.
"Stanford Customs and Traditions"
was the principal topic of the assembly,
at which four speakers addressed the
freshmen. These talks, as have been
the former two held this quarter, were
given under the auspices of the Y. M.
C. A., Y. W. C. A. and Associated Stu
dents. Ross Fisher, '21, chairman of the
Y. M. C. A. committee on freshman
assemblies, presided.
Professor Owens spoke on "Traditions
and Customs of the Past," mentioned
how the first Cardinal rugby squad won
from California against heavy odds,
when the type of football was switched
suddenly from American to rugbf. He
spoke on the importance of keeping alive
enthusiasm for Stanford, not neces
sarily by arm-waving and loud shouts,
but by earnest work and plenty of snap.
"Stanford spirit boosts something con
structive," he said; "find out what's to
be done, and let's say, 'Go to it!'"
,"Red" Aubert, president of the Men's
Council, spoke on the Honor System
and the special importance of freshmen
adhering strictly to it. "The freshmen
must take hold of the Honor System
and pass it on to future classes," he
declared, and told the '25 men how the
idea came from the students themselves,
how the Geology, Law and Engineering
Departments had used it successfully
for some time before the whole univer
sity adopted it, and how the cards pledg
ing adherence to the spirit of the enter
prise were signed unanimously by the
whole student body.
Mark Evans, varsity boxer, and mem
ber of the Circle "S" Society, delivered
a talk on "Minor Sports." He told of
the past successes of the Cardinal mi
nor sports, and of the high expectations
for the future.
R. C. Wohlford, '18, ex-editor of
Chaparral and the 1918 Quad, had as
his subject, "Stanford Customs of To
day." "There are very strong reasons
for the customs here today; they are
the things that distinguish Stanford
from other universities," he said; "the
personnel of the school changes, but the
traditions remain. All customs have pur
poses and should be observed." He
mentioned the "Hello" custom, the
roughing privilege, and spoke on the
necessity and reasons for the wearing
of "dinks" by all freshmen. Getting into
activities, absence of factional disputes,
and other essential matters were men
