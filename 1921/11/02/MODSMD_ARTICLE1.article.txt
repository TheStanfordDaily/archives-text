# VARSITY SQUAD TO DEPART FOR NORTH TONIGHT
## Leave Palo Alto at 8 o'clock For Seattle; Coach Works Team in Secret Practitce 
### 
Gene Van Gent and his squad of
Cardinal footballers will leave Palo Alto
shortly after 8 o'clock tonight bound
for Seattle and the second conference
game of the year with the University of
Washington, Saturday.
A definite list of players who will
make the long jaunt had not been re
leased at noon. The Card mentors were

figured to give out the information at
the varsity training table last night, but
there was nothing doing.
Van Gent, Joe Fitzgerald, Student
Manager Roland Kinney, and Jimmy
Ross, one of the trainers, will be with
the retinue of grid men tonight.
The varsity will leave San Francisco
about 11 o'clock tonight and should ar
rive in Seattle some time Friday after
noon. Short workouts will probably be
on the schedule at several points en
route.
Captain Jack Patrick, Art Wilcox,
Bob "Bud" Woodward,
Cliff Hey, Ray Doughty, Dud DeGroot,
"Red" Betts, "Scotchy" Campbell, Dick
Faville, Harley Carter, Fred Ludeke,
"Shorty" Mertz, "Kewp" Sproull, Dick
Pershing, A1 Taylor and one or two
more apparently have their trip cinched,
but it's more or less a guess as to who
will fill the other vacancies.
Secret practice was again in order
last night but a huge turnout of students
watched the varsity workout tonight in
the bleacher rally.
From the spectators' point of view,
Saturday's affair at Seattle should be a
beautiful battle, regardless of the out
come. Open football is always produc
tive of thrills and it's a good bet that
both Stanford and Washington will re
sort to passing and end runs.
In Wilcox and Shlaudeman, Stanford
has two broken field runners that will
rate with the best of them in the West,
according to the testimony of the ex
perts who saw them in action against
the Aggies last week.
And Washington has a little fellow
named Ray Eckmann who is far from
being a slouch once he tucks the ball
under his arm and starts nosing around
for an opening. Eckmann is captain of
the Washington varsity, and the Seattle
papers attribute the 24 to 0 defeat that
the Sun Dodgers suffered from the Ag
gies to his inability to get started in
the slow sawdust field at Corvallis.
Eckmann will not have that excuse to
offer Saturday. He will be playing on
his own field in the big Washington
stadium.
Football followers on the campus to
day were saying that the Cards would
not beat Washington as bad as the Ag
gies did, despite the fact that Van Gent's
men outplayed the Oregonians in every
; department of the game.
