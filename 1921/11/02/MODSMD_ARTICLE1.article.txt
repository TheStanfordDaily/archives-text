### 
Gene Van Gent and his squad of
Cardinal footballers will leave Palo Alto
shortly after 8 o'clock tonight bound
for Seattle and the second conference
game of the year with the University of
Washington, Saturday.
A definite list of players who will
make the long jaunt had not been re

figured to give out the information at
the varsity training table last night, but
there was nothing doing.

Manager Roland Kinney, and Jimmy
Ross, one of the trainers, will be with
the retinue of grid men tonight.
The varsity will leave San Francisco
about 11 o'clock tonight and should ar
rive in Seattle some time Friday after
noon. Short workouts will probably be
on the schedule at several points en
route.
