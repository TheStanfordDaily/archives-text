# RED AND WHITE HATS WILL BE NEW STYLE FOR USE OF ROOTERS
## 
### 
A new style of rooters' hat has
been designed by the Stunts and Ral
ly committee working in conjunction
with the yell leaders. The hats are
to be red and white. They will be
handled this year by Wideman &
Sons of Palo Alto, where they will
be placed on sale in about ten days.
The price of the hats will be $1.00.
The committee desires to have the
student body know that part of the
money taken in by the sale of these
hats goes to the financing of the
stunts for the Big Game. Every per
son in the Stanford rooting section
will be expected to have one of the
new style hats otherwise it will be
impossible to carry out certain stunts
'that have been planned.
