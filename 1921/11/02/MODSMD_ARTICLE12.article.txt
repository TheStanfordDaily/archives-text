# TRIBUTE PAID 10 POET LAS! NIGHT
## Celebration in Assembly Hall In Honor of Dante Includes Speeches, Musical Numbers 
### 
Stanford University paid its tribute to
the six hundredth anniversary of the
death of the Italian poet, Dante, in the
Assembly Hall last evening. The ideals
and fundamental truths expressed by
Dante are as much true today as they
were in the thirteenth century when
they were written. This was the key
note struck by the two speakers, Dr.
Oliver M. Johnston, and Dr. Aurelia
Henry Reinhardt, president of Mills
College.
Dr. Johnston sketched the celebrations
that are being held in honor of Dante
all over the world. He was called "the
universal genius, a poet belonging to
humanity," in a session of the League of
Nations which was entirely devoted to
him recently. A bronze wreath was
placed npon his tomb at Ravenna last
month by the American students. There
is a general movement for the restora
tion of all monuments and places which
Dante loved or of which he wrote. "No
whole group of writers have represented
so completely the age in which they
lived as Dante did," said Dr. Johnston.
"Dante epitomized the life of the Mid
dle Ages. We marvel at his great power
to present universal experiences and
ideals. His poetry is universal and be
longs not only to the Middle Ages but
to all time. His grandiose imagination
has added many pictures to the literary
world. Without his great sorrows and
suffering, however, the "Divine Comedy"
would have been impossible. Ttalv is
now recalling her poet from that exile
six hundred years later.
Dr. Reinhardt's talk was marked by
her own personality and enthusiasm.
She related a story of the Italian states
man who took Wilson's fourteen points
and proved that "Dante had said all
that six hundred years ago. In his
'Political Treatise,'" said Dr. Rein
hardt, "Dante advocates one tongue
in order that there may be unity and
understanding. Roosevelt wanted this
same thing a few years ago. Dante said
that the value of an education was the
knowledge and the use that knowledge
which are derived from it. This is what
educational conferences say today. Dante
had a special love of and faith in peace.
He said 'Peace is that noble organiza
tion which God has ordained the best
beatitude of man. Knowledge of God
and practical virtuous conduct in each
individual citizen are the essentials of
living.'"
Dr. Lee Emerson Bassett read two
selections from the "Divina Commedia."
He used the manuscript of the transla
tion by Dr. Melville Anderson, profes
sor emeritus of Stanford. Dr. Anderson
has been working on this translation for
twenty years and has just completed it.
Mrs. Elsie Cook Hughes played a
Sonata by Liszt. This was inspired by
reading the "Divine Comedy," and is
named "Apres line Lecture de Dante."
It varies in many different moods from
blaring staccato to liquid plaintive pas
sages requiring a great delicacy of touch.
Redfield Sears, baritone, sang two son
nets from Wolf.-Ferrari's oratorio, "Vi
ta Nuova." He was accompanied by
Warren D. Allen.

has been working on this translation for
twenty years and has just completed it.
Mrs. Elsie Cook Hughes played a
Sonata by Liszt. This was inspired by
reading the "Divine Comedy," and is
named "Apres line Lecture de Dante."
It varies in many different moods from
blaring staccato to liquid plaintive pas
sages requiring a great delicacy of touch.
Redfield Sears, baritone, sang two son
nets from Wolf.-Ferrari's oratorio, "Vi
ta Nuova." He was accompanied by
Warren D. Allen.
Stanford University paid its tribute to
the six hundredth anniversary of the
death of the Italian poet, Dante, in the
Assembly Hall last evening. The ideals
and fundamental truths expressed by
Dante are as much true today as they
were in the thirteenth century when
they were written. This was the key
note struck by the two speakers, Dr.
Oliver M. Johnston, and Dr. Aurelia
Henry Reinhardt, president of Mills
College.
Dr. Johnston sketched the celebrations
that are being held in honor of Dante
all over the world. He was called "the
universal genius, a poet belonging to
humanity," in a session of the League of
Nations which was entirely devoted to
him recently. A bronze wreath was
placed npon his tomb at Ravenna last
month by the American students. There
is a general movement for the restora
tion of all monuments and places which
Dante loved or of which he wrote. "No
whole group of writers have represented
so completely the age in which they
lived as Dante did," said Dr. Johnston.
"Dante epitomized the life of the Mid
dle Ages. We marvel at his great power
to present universal experiences and
ideals. His poetry is universal and be
longs not only to the Middle Ages but
to all time. His grandiose imagination
has added many pictures to the literary
world. Without his great sorrows and
suffering, however, the "Divine Comedy"
would have been impossible. Ttalv is
now recalling her poet from that exile
six hundred years later.
Dr. Reinhardt's talk was marked by
her own personality and enthusiasm.
She related a story of the Italian states
man who took Wilson's fourteen points
and proved that "Dante had said all
that six hundred years ago. In his
'Political Treatise,'" said Dr. Rein
hardt, "Dante advocates one tongue
in order that there may be unity and
understanding. Roosevelt wanted this
same thing a few years ago. Dante said
that the value of an education was the
knowledge and the use that knowledge
which are derived from it. This is what
educational conferences say today. Dante
had a special love of and faith in peace.
He said 'Peace is that noble organiza
tion which God has ordained the best
beatitude of man. Knowledge of God
and practical virtuous conduct in each
individual citizen are the essentials of
living.'"
Dr. Lee Emerson Bassett read two
selections from the "Divina Commedia."
He used the manuscript of the transla
tion by Dr. Melville Anderson, profes
sor emeritus of Stanford. Dr. Anderson
