# CANNING 10 GIVE FOOTBALL LECTURE
## Straight Football, Line Plays Will be Discussed; Connolly to Lead Initial Rally 
### 
Line Coach L. B. Canning will talk
on "Straight Football, Line Plays,"
this evening at 7:30, in Room 214, as
the second lecture in the series on
"The Technique of American Foot
ball," conducted auspices of
Walter Powell and Nestoria Debating
Society. Canning will take the sub
ject announced for Head Coach Van
Gent, who is leaving tonight for Se
attle with the varsity. Van Gent is
scheduled to speak after his return.
The energy and dash that has char
acterized Canning's work as football
coach, together with his academic
training as professor in the Economics
Department, insures an extraordinary
lecture. Canning was Ail-American
guard on the University of Chicago
team and knows line-work both as a
player and as a coach. The subject
of line work and straight football tac
tics is generally considered to be one
about which football spectators know
the least. The lecture will be one
hour in length.
Starting tonight, Yell Leader Bob
Conolly will start off the evening with
a little bleacher practice, as one of
,the means of preparation for the Big
Game.
