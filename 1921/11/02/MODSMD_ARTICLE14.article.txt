# WOMEN'S SWIMMING COACH PUTS TEAM THROUGH HARD WORK
## 
### 
Results of the intensive training
which Mrs. Ernst Brandsten, coach
for women's swimming teams, has
brought to hear on all class teams for
the past two weeks, will be exhibited
when Stanford and California meet,
next Saturday morning in Roble Pool.
Concentrated practice has brought
about marked development in both
form and speed. Beatrice Caughey,
'22, Doris Stevenson, '22, Myra Water
man, '22, and Margaret Carlsmith, '22,
will make the senior team a hard one
to score against, in the breast stroke,
long distance, and sprint events.
There is no doubt but that Frances
Fish, '23, will keep up the form of
diving that she displayed last week,
and with her and Muriel Stuart. '23,
Stanford stands a fine chance for hon
ors in that event.
Mrs. Brandsten extends an invita
tion to all women friends of Stanford
women who would like to see the
meet.
