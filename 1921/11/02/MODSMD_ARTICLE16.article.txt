# OF NEW HONOR SYSTEM ARE RELEASED
## Student Councils are Given Power of Supervision and Punishment Over Violators; Co-operation is Sought 
### 
Definite rules for observing the Hon
or System have been finished and re
leased, and will be used in the conduct
of all examinations henceforth.
The Academic Council has approved
the recommendations published below,
and they take the form of rules which
must be strictly obeyed by every stu
dent, according to an announcement
given out last night by L. L. Aubert,
president of the Men's Council.
The recommendations, cover com
pletely the workings of the Honor Sys
tem, and place the responsibility for ob
serving the rules and for penalties in
regard to the infraction of them. The

two students' councils are given large
powers, both in supervising the conduct
of examinations and in dealing with any
found guilty of violating the Honor
System. Following are the recommen
dations in respect to the Honor Sys
tem examinations approved by the
Academic Council:
1. Responsibility for honesty in the
student examinations is assumed by the
students of the University, such respon
sibility to be known as the Honor Sys
tem.
2. The primary responsibility for the
Honor System rests upon each individ
ual student, who is pledged not to re
ceive or give aid in examinations.
3. Collective responsibility for the
Honor System within a department of
the University should be accepted by the
major students of that department.
Through existing departmental organi
zations or otherwise, such major stu
dents should take special care that the
system is conserved and strengthened
within the department. It is hoped that
they may receive the encouragement and
cooperation of the instructors in the de
partment in their efforts to this end.
4. The Student Councils shall have
general supervisory control over the
conduct of examinations, and may adopt
regulations and suggestions for the
same. Such control may be exercised
through the department groups of ma
jor students, wherever such method is
found to be effective. But when need
arises, the councils shall take direct con
trol of the conduct of examinations in
a particular course or group of courses.
5. The Student Councils shall, with
the approval of the president of the Uni
versity, prepare a statement for all new
students to sign, such statement to be
included among the registrar's matricu
lation blanks; and rules and suggestions
for the conduct of examinations to be
printed upon the examination blanks
furnished by the University.
6. Infractions of the Honor System
shall be dealt with by the Student Coun
cils in the same manner as other cases
of discipline.
7. The upper division students shall
crcate a committee to be known as the
Honor System Committee, which shall
arrange for assemblies of new students
early in each quarter for the purpose of
expalining the Honor System; shall pro
mote the organization of departmental
groups of major students to conserve
the system within the departments;
shall prepare a statement concerning the
Honor System to be printed in the fresh
man handbook, and shall assume leader
ship in developing and strengthening
student opinion and responsibility with
regard to the Honor System.
Second: That the following legisla
tion be enacted:
1, Responsibility for honesty in exam
inations is hereby placed upon the stu->
dents of the University.
2. The instructor shall provide a room
where the examination may be held
without crowding, or two sets of ques
tions may be used in alternate seats, or
examinations in two different courses
may be given in the same room, the
students in different courses alternating.
After the questions have been presented
and inquiries answered, the instructor
shall withdraw from the room.
