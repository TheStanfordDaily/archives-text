# BABES PREPARING TO MEET U.C. FRESHMEN
## 
### 
With only a little over a week left
before the struggle with the Blue and
Gold freshmen, Coach Seay is putting
his men through hard workouts and
perfecting them in several phases of
play.
Having the advantages of weight,
strength and skill all in their favor, the
Card yearlings are rounding into the
strongest first-year football machine in
Stanford's history.
After a short drill at signal practice,
Coach Seay sent his men against the
varsity last evening. This afternoon the
Babes will again invade the varsity field
during the bleacher rally, giving Van
Gent's warriors a last bit of scrimmage
before their leaving for the north to
battle with the University of Washing
ton eleven. The yearlings took the of
fensive and were able to make effective
gains against their weightier and more
seasoned opponents.
Starting from their own goal line in
one of their most spectacular drives,
the Babes fought their way down the
entire length of the field, only to loose
the ball on a fumble within a few yards
of the varsity goal.
llarman, Howard, Gilliland and Wheat
composed the freshmen backficld at the
start of the scrimmage. Mcßoric and
Neill took the guard positions; Jergcns
and Shipke at tackles; Janssen and
Fuller covering the ends, and Williams
at center. Coach Sefty continued to
shift and change the lineup throughout
the scrimmage, giving practically every
lirst-string man a chance to get into it.
Next Saturday afternoon the Babes
take issue with the Tjncoln High aggre
gation from Los Angeles on the local
turf. The prep school men have a likely
squad of players and are expected to
make things interesting for Seay's pro
teges.
