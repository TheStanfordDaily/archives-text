# Personal Goodbyes.
## 
### 
Tonight, at 8:49, twenty-five men representing
the Cardinal leave for Seattle to play the touted
Washington University eleven in the second game of
the Conference season. Coach Van Gent is in
charge of the squad that is making the trip, and the
football manager and trainer are also accompanying
the men. This is the largest number of men that
Stanford has ever sent on the northern trip, and in
the number is included one of the best teams that
have worn the "Fighting Red." Captain Patrick
and his squad are out to make the fight of the season
before the "Big Scrap" of the nineteenth. They
will have a wet field to play on if the weather keeps
on as it has for the past month in the north, and
will be handicapped by the strange field. The dope
gives the Stanford team all the edge in the coming
fracas, but it will be no easy pickings. The team
from the University of Washington will lie fighting
on their own grounds in their own stadium, and will
contest every inch to put the skids under Stanford's
chances in the race for the Pacific Coast title.
It should be a pleasure and privilege to go down
to the station tonight and by a parting personal hand
shake send the members of the team on their trip
to the north. There is not to be a formal gathering
at the depot, but the help that a personal expression
of cheery good-bye brings at the moment of leaving
on a long trip is inestimable.
