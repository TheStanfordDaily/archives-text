# The 						Motor Rule.
## 
### 
The fact that the motor rule, which prohibits
University women motoring after seven-thirty un
chaperoned, is at present being enforced to the let
ter, brings up for consideration not only the duty of
the women in keeping their rules, but also the value
of the regulation.
The rule itself is difficult to enforce, and the num
ber of recent infractions seems to indicate the gen
eral doubt of its justice. Either the women of the
University should recognize it as it stands or else it
should be modified to suit changing conditions. The
regulation still stands on the books of Organized
Women, and infraction of it merits penalty.
But does it justify its own existence?
To the women the University has delegated the
enforcement of their rules. The way in which they
accept this responsibility will prove their right to
govern themselves. If infraction of such a regula
tion as the motor rule is common, a laxity in regard
to other rules is the natural sequence.
The question is not as to whether the rule should
be enforced. As a University regulation it must be
"complied with. The problem rather to be considered
is, are we not now ready for a change?
If not the complete abolition of the motor rule,
at least some modification of it is necessary, for it
is hard to obey laws in which we have no faith, and
only by observance of their own regulations can the
women of the Univesity prove their right to self
government as an organized unit. M. J. C.

THE TWO NEW SONGS, "Fight for Stanford"
and "Alma Mater," are going to be winners when
all the rooters know them well and can sing them as
they can sing the old standbys. Without a knowl
edge of the words they can't be given properly, and
can never be put over while the rooting section
stands and reads them from slips of paper. Ihe
choir effect is not in keeping with the tunes or
words. Before the next rally let's get down and
learn the wfirds by heart, so that when the
leaders start the songs, the old bleachers on the
opposite side of the field will shiver. It is only two
weeks until the Big Game rally, and this one is go
ing to put all previous ones to shame for noise and
enthusiasm. The songs if known well will be of
inestimable help. Don't put off the learning of them
until the last minute. Get them down pat now, and
then you can practice on them in the time that
remains.

THE SECOND TALK Oil football is tonight. Pro
fessor Canning will lecture in room 214. His talk
will l>c on "Line Plays."
