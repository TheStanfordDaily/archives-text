There was a young student named Randall,
Whose actions proclaimed him a vandal,
One look at his face,
Would wreck the whole place.
Now, who ever heard of such scandal?
» * *
When What Passed By?
There was an old duffer called Nye,
Who placidly winked his glass eye;
He did it for fun,
The son of a gun,
And wouldn't tell anyone why.
* * *
There once live a bear of a Bruin,
Who laid his surroundings to ruin;
He tackled a Card,
But found the job hard,
He didn't know what he was doin'.
* * *
There was a young fellow named Ogey,
Who shook at the sight of a bogey;
He got the worst feeling,
While living in Wheeling,
Where hospital followed a stogie.
* * *
There was a young Stanford magician,
Who put a spell on his tuition;
But try as he would,
It did him no good,
To use his art on a condition.

In spite of the action of our brothers of the prole
tariat, this crew hereby announces its intention of going
out on strike, unless the following conditions are met:
* * *
1. Time and a half for overtime in class.
2. 41-minute period at 11 o'clock.
3. Cuts in Money every Monday.
4. Correctors to provide rolling stock in classrooms.
5. Basis of credit to the amount of space covered.
Ruling retroactive to October 1.
6. Working conditions to be abolished.
7. Railway Transportation to be made safe by elimina
tion of 10 per cent grades.

Hugo, the midnight moth, spiralled a dizzy one when
lie remarked that the Beavers will have a broad tale
to tell when they hit the home-pond.

me lads; even Solomon had to get a start.

THE SNAPPY ROUGHT
Fall fashions for upholders of the glorious tradition.
Something very chic in semester shirts has been im
troduced in the new tweed effect. This model has two
pockets, triple pleated to carry date books, and with
the cravenette proofed fronts in favor with those partial
to the free course at the Union. These may be pur
chased at quife remarkable rates in our smartest shops,
with reductions on lots of seven to permit the daily
change now imperative.
♦ * *
The very latest thing in scarfs has come out in the
new rough's neckwear. This tie is modelled after the
boarding-house bath rug, and sold in popular gravy
brown tints.
* * »
LA DERNIER CRI in hair dress has appeared in
the new tidal wave. Worn without the CHAPEAU,
nonchalant perfection is attained by brushing the hair
back from the brow in a single curl, which should be
allowed to blow heroically in the breeze. An insouci
ant air is added by running the hand through the locks
at intervals.
9ft * 3fC
Hints on cord decorations for the winter season indi
cate that mural designs are being supplanted by im
pressionistic art work symmetrical with the crease.
In this connection a movement has been started by our
more advanced thinkers to have the ribs of alternating
hues, as is the custom in the most popular state insti
tutions.
* * *
A heavier and clumsier note has been sounded in
shoe fashions. However, the new model is not yet
perfected to take the high gloss required by our best
roughs. Severe ochre shades with a lavender motif
are the rage in hosiery.
* * *
These suggestions are freely donated to patriotic engi
neers, and others, who spend their Saturday nights
inscribing 1471 in telephone booths.
* * *
WAR —is hereby declared on the guy who brags
about his punchboard winnings.
* * *
Synopsis of any movie serial: "Round and round the
mulberry bush the monkey chased the weasel."
» * *
A request —Will the gent who pulls in at 3 a.m.. please
have his shoes tuned?

No need to urge the Wednesday night habit. Even
the frosh have it.
* * *
Popular Superstitions
That~an alarm clock prevents 8 o'clock cuts.
* * *'
Ex committee makes polo a minor sport. Disaster for
the semester shirt. To soften the blow, we submit
these pre-requisites.
• * *
1. At least three quarters of croquet.
2. Capacity to ride a horse anywhere; preferably on
the saddle.
3. Experience in driving ball at high speed while
balancing gravy boat jauntily on head.
4. Qualification as model for Hart, Sihaffner, and
Marx.
* * *
Check. Ability to dismount on the run. (Or any other
soft place).

There was a young student named Randall,
Whose actions proclaimed him a vandal,
One look at his face,
Would wreck the whole place.
Now, who ever heard of such scandal?

When What Passed By?
There was an old duffer called Nye,
Who placidly winked his glass eye;
He did it for fun,
The son of a gun,
And wouldn't tell anyone why.

There once live a bear of a Bruin,
Who laid his surroundings to ruin;
He tackled a Card,
But found the job hard,
He didn't know what he was doin'.

There was a young fellow named Ogey,
Who shook at the sight of a bogey;
He got the worst feeling,
While living in Wheeling,
Where hospital followed a stogie.

There was a young Stanford magician,
Who put a spell on his tuition;
But try as he would,
It did him no good,
To use his art on a condition.

THE SNAPPY ROUGHT
Fall fashions for upholders of the glorious tradition.
Something very chic in semester shirts has been im
troduced in the new tweed effect. This model has two
pockets, triple pleated to carry date books, and with
the cravenette proofed fronts in favor with those partial
to the free course at the Union. These may be pur
chased at quife remarkable rates in our smartest shops,
with reductions on lots of seven to permit the daily
change now imperative.

The very latest thing in scarfs has come out in the
new rough's neckwear. This tie is modelled after the
boarding-house bath rug, and sold in popular gravy
brown tints.

LA DERNIER CRI in hair dress has appeared in
the new tidal wave. Worn without the CHAPEAU,
nonchalant perfection is attained by brushing the hair
back from the brow in a single curl, which should be
allowed to blow heroically in the breeze. An insouci
ant air is added by running the hand through the locks
at intervals.

Hints on cord decorations for the winter season indi
cate that mural designs are being supplanted by im
pressionistic art work symmetrical with the crease.
In this connection a movement has been started by our
more advanced thinkers to have the ribs of alternating
hues, as is the custom in the most popular state insti
tutions.

A heavier and clumsier note has been sounded in
shoe fashions. However, the new model is not yet
perfected to take the high gloss required by our best
roughs. Severe ochre shades with a lavender motif
are the rage in hosiery.
