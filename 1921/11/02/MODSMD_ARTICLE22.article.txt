# ROOSEVELT STATUE FORMS FEATURE AT A. P. PROCTOR STUDIO
## 
### 
A. Phimister Proctor, the noted sculp
tor, has returned from a month's trip
to Portland, Oregon, and is again at
work In his stmlio on the campus.
Among the many statues displayed
here may be mentioned the one of
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt on his
horse. The original figure is in New
York, at the studio Mr. Proctor built
especially for enlarging statues. The
: culptor will leave for the east the latter
part of this month to complete the arma
ture of the Roosevelt model, which is
to be presented to Portland, Oregon, by
Dr. Henry Waldo Coe, of that city. Dr.
Coe was a great friend of Colonel Roo
sevelt and they had adjoining ranches
in Wyoming at one time.
The "Circuit Rider," the working
model of which is now complete and
will be enlarged to a height of thirteen
feet, is another interesting example of
the work of Mr. Proctor. This statue
was cast the early part of last Septem
ber, while the sculptor was waiting for
the deer in Oregon with President Ray
Lyman Wilbur. The circuit riders were
men of the New England states who
traveled in the east since the middle of
the eighteenth century and came west
as far as Washington, Oregon and Cali
fornia during the period from 1800-
1890. They were pioneer preachers, and
in order to commemorate their services,
as well as in appreciation of the hard
ships these men underwent, Senator R.
A. Booth of Oregon had the "Circuit
Rider" made by Mr. Proctor. Senator
Booth, who is chairman of the Oregon
Highway Commission, is going to pre
sent the statue to the state of Oregon.
It will be placed in front of the State
House at Salem.
Edwin Spencer Booth, '23, is a nephew
of Senator Booth.
"On the War Trail" is of interest to
people of this vicinity as the Indian who
posed for it was here last spring. He was
a native of Montana, and was brought
to the Proctor studio by the artist, who
later took him to New York. Stephen
Knight, with whom Dr. Proctor played
baseball when a boy, is the donor of the
figure which will be finished in bronze
and placed in the Civic Center at Dcn
! ver, Colorado.
Mr. Proctor is especially interested
in Indians. Last September, after leav
ing Dr. Wilbur, and going deer hunt
ing for two weeks in Siskiyou county,
Oregon, the sculptor attended the Pen
dleton roundup, which is held every
year. This is a famous gathering in
which about four hundred Indians par
ticipate. It lasts four days, during which
time parades and steer-roping are the
most important features of the meeting.
The Indians are all in their native cos
tumes and combine to form the most
gorgeous spectacle in America, in the

hope of forever keeping the old western
spirit alive.
Mr. Proctor is now completing two
has reliefs. One is of Professor T. J.
Hoover, of the Mining Department, a
brother of Herbert Hoover. The other
bas relief is a representation of the little
daughter of Professor John Pierce
Mitchell of the Department of Chem
istrv.

ber, while the sculptor was waiting for
the deer in Oregon with President Ray
Lyman Wilbur. The circuit riders were
men of the New England states who
traveled in the east since the middle of
the eighteenth century and came west
as far as Washington, Oregon and Cali
fornia during the period from 1800-
1890. They were pioneer preachers, and
in order to commemorate their services,
as well as in appreciation of the hard
ships these men underwent, Senator R.
A. Booth of Oregon had the "Circuit
Rider" made by Mr. Proctor. Senator
Booth, who is chairman of the Oregon
Highway Commission, is going to pre
sent the statue to the state of Oregon.
It will be placed in front of the State
House at Salem.
Edwin Spencer Booth, '23, is a nephew
of Senator Booth.
"On the War Trail" is of interest to
people of this vicinity as the Indian who
posed for it was here last spring. He was
a native of Montana, and was brought
to the Proctor studio by the artist, who
later took him to New York. Stephen
Knight, with whom Dr. Proctor played
baseball when a boy, is the donor of the
figure which will be finished in bronze
and placed in the Civic Center at Dcn
! ver, Colorado.
Mr. Proctor is especially interested
in Indians. Last September, after leav
ing Dr. Wilbur, and going deer hunt
ing for two weeks in Siskiyou county,
Oregon, the sculptor attended the Pen
dleton roundup, which is held every
year. This is a famous gathering in
which about four hundred Indians par
ticipate. It lasts four days, during which
time parades and steer-roping are the
most important features of the meeting.
The Indians are all in their native cos
tumes and combine to form the most
gorgeous spectacle in America, in the

hope of forever keeping the old western
spirit alive.
Mr. Proctor is now completing two
has reliefs. One is of Professor T. J.
Hoover, of the Mining Department, a
brother of Herbert Hoover. The other
bas relief is a representation of the little
daughter of Professor John Pierce
Mitchell of the Department of Chem
istrv.
A. Phimister Proctor, the noted sculp
tor, has returned from a month's trip
to Portland, Oregon, and is again at
work In his stmlio on the campus.
Among the many statues displayed
here may be mentioned the one of
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt on his
horse. The original figure is in New
York, at the studio Mr. Proctor built
especially for enlarging statues. The
: culptor will leave for the east the latter
part of this month to complete the arma
ture of the Roosevelt model, which is
to be presented to Portland, Oregon, by
Dr. Henry Waldo Coe, of that city. Dr.
Coe was a great friend of Colonel Roo
sevelt and they had adjoining ranches
in Wyoming at one time.
The "Circuit Rider," the working
model of which is now complete and
will be enlarged to a height of thirteen
feet, is another interesting example of
the work of Mr. Proctor. This statue
was cast the early part of last Septem
ber, while the sculptor was waiting for
the deer in Oregon with President Ray
Lyman Wilbur. The circuit riders were
