# ON THE KICK-OFF
## 
### 
"Corky" Courtwright, coach of Ne
vada's varsity which meets Stanford
here a week from Saturday, was in
the stands at the Oregon Aggie affair.
Courtwright had his pencil busy most
of the time keeping tab of the Cardi
nal plays.
* » *
Several of Andy Smith's Californi
ans were also "among those present."
"Brick" Muller, the star end, "Dutch" i
'Eels and Walter Gordon, one of the j
Bruin line mentors, all got a thrill
out of the game. Gordon was here for
the express purpose of scouting Stan
ford plays for Smith and it could be
seen from the press-box that he was
following orders.
♦ * *
San Francisco sports writers are
now calling the Stanford varsity the
"lighting Cards." One of them re
marked after the game that when it
came to "fighting" the Cards had it
on the "fighting Aggies."
* ♦ *
Morris Kirksey, the star sprinter,
was betting even money that
stands fell. That was about the time
that Stanford scored the winning
touchdown.

While Stanford is playing Wash
ington in the far north, California
will meet what looks to be its hard
est opponent of the season thus far,
"Gloomy Gus" Henderson's South
ern California Trojans. Graduate
Manager W. D. Fletcher has received
an allotment of seats for the game
and has placed them on sale at Jack
Meyer's Encina Store.
* * #
Henderson has predicted that the
Bruins will beat his team at least
35 to 0. That's why they call him
"Gloomy Gus."
* * *
The Trojans have used two sets of
backs in all of their games this sea
son. Captain Dean, Kincaid, Chet
Dolley, Phil Tierman, Campbell, Amor
Galloway, Lockett and Eddie Leahy
are just a few of his meteors, not to
speak of Johnny Leadingham, the
quarterback, who is six feet tall and
weighs 135 pounds. They call him
"The Eeel."

Tommy Davis' strong Lincoln High
team from Los Angeles, will furnish
the opposition for Duffy Seay's fresh
man team here, Saturday.
