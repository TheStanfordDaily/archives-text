# VARSITY DEBATING SQUAD CHOSEN FOR CALIFORNIA CONTEST
## 
### 
Representatives of three classes in the
University were chosen Monday after
noon to take their places on the varsity
team in the annual debate with the Uni
versity of California.
The men chosen to represent Stanford
from this group are Matthew Tobriner,
'24; Ward Miller, '23, and Richard Jenk
ins, '25. These debaters will be given
three units of university credit for their
participation in this contest.
The squad was chosen by Professor
Bassett of the Public Speaking Depart
ment, and Professor Emerson, debating
coach, from the largest list of try on tees
that has ever presented themselves at a
Stanford varsity debate tryout.
The debate with California has always
been an annual affair, but due to a mis
understanding was not held last year.
The question which has been chosen
is, "Resolved, That Congress Should
Enact a Law to Exempt Coastwise Ship
ping of the United States From the
Panama Canal Tolls." Stanford will up
hold the affirmative. The debate will be
held in the Stanford Assembly Hall
during the last week in November.
