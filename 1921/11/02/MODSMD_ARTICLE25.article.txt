# GLEE CLUB PLANS TOUR INTO MEXICO
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Stanford Glee
Club last week the members voted
authority to their officers "to borrow
$350 to send Francisco Cornejo, a well
known Mexican artist, to make ar
rangements for their proposed trip to
Mexico during the Christmas holidays.
Cornejo will interview President Obre
gon, who promises free transportation
on all railways, and University of
Mexico officials, under whose auspices
the Glee Club is to sing.
The Glee Club will take about thirty
members, including J. E. McDowell,
Alumni Secretary, and Professor Espi
nosa, who will be Stanford Universi
ty's representative. They will sing
in the three largest Mexican cities,
Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Puebla.
The party will leave on December 21,
and will sing in Los Angeles on
December 22, in Phoenix, Arizona, on
December 24, in El Paso, Texas, on
Deeember 26, in Guadalajara, on De
cember 28, in Mexico City, on Decem
ber 30 and 31, in Puebla on January
3; returning home January 9. It is
estimated that the trip will cost about
$5000, and this sum will be obtained
in written guarantees from wealthy
Americans and Mexicans in Mexico,
as well as from the institutions at
which they will sing. It is not to be
a money-making trip, but it is hoped
that friendly relations between Mexico
and the United States will be greatly
furthered by the visit.
