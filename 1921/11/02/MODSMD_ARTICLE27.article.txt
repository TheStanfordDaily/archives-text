# Roble Bridge To Be Made Safe For Heavy Traffic
## 
### 
Roble bridge will be completely re
habilitated when the work now going
forward is finished. Decrepit from long
service, it was found necessary to en
tirely replace most of the supports. New
piles are being set in place on solid
bases, the girders are doubly reinforced,
and new planking is to be installed.
The renovated structure will follow ex
actly the previous design. This restora
tion will thus leave the scene unchanged,
except for the initials, etc., commemorat
ing past events.
