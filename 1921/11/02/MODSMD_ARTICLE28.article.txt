"China needs our help. If left to her
self, military powers now in control will
continue to promote disorder until Eu
ropean powers find it necessary to step
in," was the plea made for American
assistance in Chinese problems, by Dr.
iiailey Willis of the Geology Depart
ment, in his lecture Monday in the
Women's Clubhouse before the Cosmo
politan Club. "We should treat China
as we did Cuba," he continued, "and
then relations between China and Amer
ica will be knitted more closely to
gether."
With an old Chinese proverb the
speaker then summed' up the whole Chi
nese attitude. "I till my own fields; 1
dig my own well; 1 drink my own water,
and what care I for courts and king?'
Continuing, Dr. Willis explained how
the Chinese individuals were strong
morally but weak collectively. He cited
a recent provincial famine as an in
stance of Chinese inconsistency. During
the famine sacks of rice stood outside
the temple untouched, while starvation
seemed imminent. Yet so weak col
lectively were the Chinese, no organized
attempt was made to obtain help from
a neighboring province.
In speaking of the high character of
the Chinese, Dr. Willis said that dur
ing his 3,000-mile trip across China sev
eral years ago, he was never once ap
proached by a vandal.
The speaker praised the Cosmopolitan
Club and' said its fellowship is larger
than our fellowship of either state,
county or township.
Refreshments were served following
the lecture. Following the evening's
program, a business meeting of the club
members worked out some of the de
tails of International Night, Novem
ber 14.
