# TRYOUTS FOR ANNUAL SOPHOMORE PLAY DUE
## 
### 
Tryouts for the annual sophomore
play will be held this week, according to
Coach Gordon Davis. The tryouts will
be held Thursday afternoon from 3
until 5 o'clcok in the Assembly Hall,
and Thursday evening from 7 until 9
in the Little Theater.
Only members of the class of 1924
are eligible for parts in the cast. This
play offers an unusual opportunity for
men interested in dramatics to secure
a proper field for their efforts. As to
the women, it is their first opportunity
to participate in Stanford dramatics, and
campus critics invariably look forward
to this production as it is here that tal
ent among the women is first uncovered.
For these reasons, it is hoped by those
in charge that a large and representa
tive group of sophomores will turn out.
Matthew Tobriner, chairman of the
play committee, and Gordon Davis have
been in negotiation for some time with
Eastern playwrights in regard to secur
ing the privilege of producing some of
the latest comedy hits of the season.
The final selection has not been defi
nitely made, but an announcement in this
respect is expected late this week.
