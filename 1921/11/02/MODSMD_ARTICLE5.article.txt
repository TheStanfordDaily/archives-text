# First Scrimmage In Football Show Is Staged by Cast
## 
### 
A crescent moon beamed from a
lacquered sky. Its silver darts filtering
through the lacy palms traced a mystic
filagree on the sward. Soft zephyrs bore
tender murmurings from shrouded
oases. Sweet silence burdened all the
Inner Quad.
Hark!
What is that distant roar? The voice
of any angry mob smites the ear. The
door of the Little Theater is flung open.
A limp form stumbles out and stagger√ü
to the nearest post. Gasping, "The old
mangle was never like that," he falls
into a faint.
One wall bulges and a window falls
out. A door bursts from its hinges and
reveals a scene of strife only surpassed
by I. Malone Le Gurrl's famous can
vas "Revolt in a sardine cannery." A
surging mob packs the place like at a
student body assembly. Almost crowded
off the stage is Les Seib, hoarse, but
shouting.
"This is the last meeting of the en
tire cast of the Chappie football show.
After this the acts will be rehearsed
separately or out in the prarie. The
cast of this show will not only be the
best but the largest the campus has ever
seen."
He's right!
