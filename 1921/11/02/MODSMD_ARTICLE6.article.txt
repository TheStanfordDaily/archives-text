# NEW REGISTER SHOWS GREATER ENROLLMENT
## Largest Figures In History of University Are Given In New Student Directory 
### 
The total registration of Stanford on
November 1, as shown by the new di
rectory of officers and students of the
University, issued today from the reg
istrar's office, is 2711, the highest in the
history of the University. This is an
increase of 222 over the figures of last
year at this time, which was the high
water-mark in registration up to that
date.
The classification by group is as fol
lows: 1920 1921
Graduates 281 363
Undergraduates 2162 2284
Specials 46 64
Totals 2489 2711
The specials ire mostly Federal Vo
cational Board students. No other than
Vocational Board specials were admitted
during the autumn and winter quarters
of last year nor during the present
quarter.
The classification by old and new stu
dents is as follows: 1920 1921
Old 1710 2091
New 779 620
Totals 2489 2711
However, of the new men with less
than a year and a half college standing
matriculating during the summer quar
ter, all but fifty had to be counted as if
matriculating in October. There were
148 such summer-autumn matriculates.
(There were none in excess of fifty in
1920.) The real comparative figures
should therefore read: 1920 1921
Old 1710 1943
New 779 168
Totals 2489 2711
In forecasting the number of women
students the registrar's office, basing its
expectations on experience, assumes that
360 old students will return, leaving
places for 140 new students. The needle
tends to come to rest at this point but
never actually does. Summer matricu
lates are always counted as "new." The
statistics of new women students for the
current quarter are as follows:
Summer matriculates 24
