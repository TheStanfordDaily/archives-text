# BLOCK CUE'S' TO BE GRANTED RUGBY PLAYERS
## Executive Body Rates Polo as Second Class Minor Sport; Adopt New Rooters' Hats 
### 
In accordance with a recommendation
by Major Collins of the Military Train
ing Department, polo was made a first
class minor sport by the executive com
mittee at its regular meeting last night.
The rating given polo was left subject to
change owing to the possibility of in
tercollegiate competition with the Uni
versity of California and Oregon Agri
cultural College at a future time.
A resolution was passed granting all
members of the rugby team who play
against the University of British Co
lumbia the Block Circle "S." This step
was taken owing to the fact that the
University of California has refused to
play the annual rugby game with Stan
ford on December 3. e
The recommendation of the rally
committee to adopt permanent rooters'
hats of a different type than used here
tofore was accepted. The new hats are
to be reversible with red and white
colors, in order to do away with the
cards which have been used in the past
in the bleacher stunts. Homer Mitchell,
'21, chairman of the committeej an
nounced that the Assembly Hall had
been secured for the Big Game rally on
the condition that no revolvers or fire
arms of any kind would be allowed in
the building during the rally.
Appropriation was made for the pur
pose of sending a circular letter to all
underclassmen reminding them of the
agreement with the University of Cali
fornia that there should be no invasion
of either campus by students of the rival
universities.
