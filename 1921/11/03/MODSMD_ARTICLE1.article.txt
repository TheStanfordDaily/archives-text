# HOPKINS TELLS JOURNALISTS OF GREATEST SCOOP
## Examiner Reporter Speaks of News Value in Connection With Father Heslin Murder 
### 
The finding of the body of Father
Heslin, in the Hightower case, "the
greatest exclusive in a decade," was
the principal medium which Ernest
J. Hopkins, '10, used in illustrating his
talk on "News Value," made before
some thirty campus journalists, at the
Kappa Alpha Theta house, last even
ing, under the auspices of the Stan
ford chapter of the American Journal
ists' Association.
Hopkins reviewed the many news
problems arising with the story of the
disappearance of Father Heslin, the
disinterrment of the body of the priest
by a San Francisco Examiner party,
of which he was a member, and sub
sequent unearthal of facts wlicih led
to the conviction of Hightower as the
murderer.
He laid much stress upon the ten
dency of the news writer to unconsci
ously reflect his personal opinion in
regard to the innocence or guilt of
a man accused of crime in such series
of news stories, citing instances from
the recent Arbuckle case in regard to
this diffculty of impartial judgment.
So-called, sensationalism, in San
Francisco papers was partially de
fended by Hopkins, who stated that
the newspaper did not altogether mold
public demand for news, but was it
self an effort to respond to the popular
demand for the unusual and the sense
appeal in newspaper stories. He gave
examples in support of this conten
tion, showing that papers which had
adopted a very conservative stand in
the presentation of such "thrillers"
had been imperiled financially, often
going into adject bankruptcy.
Hopkins has evolved a new statistic
al system for the valuation of news
stories, in which they are regarded
according to their psychological action
toward the individuals or institutions
concerned in the articles, and hopes
to prove its value through further use.
Pointed out as one of the few college
men who have attained prominence in
coast journalism, Hopkins takes
especial interest in the journalism of
Stanford, in which he did most of his
preliminary news work.
