# LILLY'S FOOTBALL HOPES GETTING IN SOME STIFF WORK
## 
### 
Coach Ken Lilly .put his 135-pound
football proteges through a stiff work
out last night. Forty men in suits with
shoulder-pads and headgear reported
for practice, and snapped into signal
drills and line scrimmage with all the
enthusiasm of the varsity. Some very
good material has shown up, former
members of the varsity, freshmen and
soccer squads especially being promi
nent. At present Lilly is putting par
ticular emphasis on perfecting the exe
cution of the ordinary line and end-run
plays.
Two squads staged a torrid battle for
about a half-hour, taking turns at carry
ing the ball against each other. Weak
ness in tackling was evident, while at
the same time several backs showed a
high-class ability to run low and plunge.
Later, three squads ran through signal
drill and then scrimmaged. The men
are getting into fairly good condition
and are better able to bounce off the
hard practice field.
