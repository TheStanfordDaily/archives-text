# WOMEN'S CHORUS PICKED BY SEIB FOR CHAPPIE SHOW
## 
### 
With such material as Donaldine
Cameron, Dorothy and Anabeth Wood
head and Margaret Lies, Coach Lester
Seib expects to stage the most complete
and professional musical revue in the

history of University dramatics in the
Hammer and Coffin football show on
November 19.
The cast has been practically picked
for in all but minor parts. It is the
largest cast ever assembled here, and
contains a greater number of individual
stars than any previous performance of
its kind. There will be eight short,
snappy variety acts, besides a number
of curtain surprises. The entire program

has been carefully planned with the
purpose of getting just as much as pos
sible into just as short a space of time
as possible.
On account of the shortness of time
remaining before the presentation of
the Chappies' show, and the large
amount of work yet to be done, Coach
Seib requests all persons in the cast to
report promptly at the designated time
for rehearsals. The members due to
rehearse will be notified over the tele
phone or through the columns of the
Daily Palo Alto.
The women's chorus which has just
been chosen, will play a very prominent
part in the production. They will be
featured in a musical act with singing
and dancing and all the requisites of
good musical comedy. This act will un
doubtedly be one of the stellar "knock
outs" of the evening.
The east of "Arkansas" will meet at
7 o'clock tonight in the Assembly Hall
for rehearsal. The "Epilogue" and "The
Blue Envelope" will be rehearsed an
hour later in the same place. All mem
bers of both casts must report at the
designated time.
