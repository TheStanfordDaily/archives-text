before their departure for the north,
the yearlings invaded the varsity field
for scrimmage.
At no time during the struggle was it
a complete walkaway for the varsity.
Despite the disadvantage of weight and
experience, which both worked against
them, the Seay gridders gave a good
account of themselves and made the
Cards put forth real efforts to hold them
within check.
Lincoln High will arrive on the cam
pus late tomorrow evening or early Sat
urday morning. Although this team was
rated in the early part of the season
as one of the fastest prep school aggre
gations in the south, they have been
in a slump for several games and have
been beaten by both the Manual Arts
and Los Angeles High elevens. Never
theless, they have some good gridmen
on the squad and claim that their de
feats have been due to the proverbial
Jinx.
Coach Seay wil start his first-string
lineup and in case of an easy victory
will give every man on the squad a
chance on the field.
