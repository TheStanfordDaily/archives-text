# CARDINAL TEAM, THIRTY STRONG, NEARS SEATTLE
## Van Gent Faces Necessity of Winning From Sun Dodgers And Yet Save His Cripples 
### 
Confident of victory, the retinue of
about thirty Stanford football players,
coaches, manager and trainer are to
night nearing Seattle, Washington, and
their second Pacific Coast conference
struggle of the 1921 grid campaign.
Saturday's game with the University
of Washington promises to be a fray
closer than some of the more optimistic
have predicted.
In the first place, Gene Van Gent will
be handicapped by injuries, and he faces
the problem of winning the game and
yet the necessity of saving his crip
ples for the remainder of the games
this season.
Frank Sproull, varsity end, did rot
leave with the squad last night. He
sprained his wrist Tuesday night and
will be out of the game until November
19, according to indications. With
Sproull out of the game Saturday, iMertz
and Pershing are certain to open up at
the wing positions. Larson may also
break in before the last quarter has
been completed.
Harley Carter is in none too good
condition, and if he plays it is probable
that the Card mentors will only leave
him in until a Stanford victory is as
sured.
Joe Douglas, the husky lineman who
has been out of the fray for three weeks
with a torn ligament in his shoulder, is
back in the fold and will probably break
in at Seattle. Douglas' 200 pounds will
greatly strengthen the squad should the
Washington backs start pounding the
line too heavily.
Art Wilcox, whose work against the
Oregon Aggies stamped him along with
Rob Shlaudeman as the star of the Card
backs, is in poor condition and may
not play at Seattle. It is believed, how
ever, that he will open at his usual po
sition and stay in until the varsity has
scored.
With Wilcox out of the game, Wood
ward would probably go to quarter and
Shlaudeman would shift to half. Rut
there are many who believe that Cliff
Hey, captain of the freshmen team last
year, is being groomed to step in at half
if Wilcox is not started. Hey is fast
and he bits the line hard.
The varsity looked good in their short
workout with Duffy Seay's freshmen
last night. From indications it is be
lieved here that Stanford should de
feat the Sun Dodgers by at least two
touchdowns. Enoch Ragshaw, coach of
the Washington varsity, has expressed
the belief that both Stanford and Cali
fornia would easily defeat his team.
With the varsity playing in the far
north, attention on the campus will be
riveted on the U. S. C.-California bat
tle at Rerkeley Saturday. Graduate
Manager Fletcher secured a limited
number of the pasteboards for the game.
He put them on sale and they went like
hotcakes.
One thing seems certain: The ma
jority of the Stanford followers hope
that Andy Smith's men decisively de
feat the Trojans.
When Stanford and California line up
on November 19, partisans of both uni
versities will hope that the result of
the game will definitely settle the coast
football supremacy.
The men who left with the varsity
squad last night were: Coaches Gene
Van Gent and Joe Fitzgerald, Captain
Jack Patrick, Art Wilcox, Bob Shlaude
man, Ray Doughty, Cliff Hey, Norman
Cleveland, "Benny" Benninger, Mike
Reed, Dud DeGroot, "Red" Betts, Dick
Pershing, "Shorty" Mertz, Bob Stice,
"Scotchy" Campbell, Harley Carter,
Fred Ludeke, Joe Douglas, "Swede"
Larson, Glen Hartranft, Flood, A1 Tay
lor, Dick Faville and Greenwood.
