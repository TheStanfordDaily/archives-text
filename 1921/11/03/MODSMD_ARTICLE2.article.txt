## 
### 
About 1,200 men and 250 women ap
peared at the football iield yesterday
afternoon for the bleacher rally which
was held to give the varsity a send-off
before it started on its trip to meet the
University of Washington.
The feature of the rally was the large
turnout of women. It was stated by
several students who have been here
for a number of years that it was the
best representation of the women at a
week-day rally for quite awhile. The
women will be given another oppor
tunity to increase the number at the
next rally, which will be held next
Thursday.
Owing to the fact that the band did
not make its appearance, as had been
arranged, it was found impossible to
practice the new songs or to introduce
"Alma Mater."
Copies of the words of all the latest
songs were distributed to the rooters.
Yell Leader Connolly asks that these
copies be kept until the next rally, when
the new songs will be practiced.
The yell leaders expressed themselves
as being highly pleased with the num
bers of rooters that came out for the
rally. A short rally will be held next
Monday evening at the Southern Pacific
depot as a welcome to the team on its
arrival back from Washington. The
exact time and further particulars will
be given in these columns on Friday or
Monday.
Yell Leader Connolly and bis two
assistants, Lou Minsky and Chet Doug
las, are making arrangements for a
rally to be held in the new stadium
about five days previous to the Rig
Game. At this time the rooters will be
given instructions about the stunts for
the Big Game. The committee hopes
to have the largest rally of the year on
this occasion.
