More than a thousand men and women filled the
south bleachers at the football field yesterday after
noon to yell for the team and send it on its way to the
north. The rooters were filled with the old pep and
raised the sky with their vociferations. As far as
the purpose of the rally went, however, there was a
flat failure. Why? The band, announced to lead
the singing of the new songs that all are anxious to
learn, did not appear, it was not a day of practice
for the band. Admitted. No formal notice was
given to the band at the practice Tuesday that they
were to attend the rally as a band. This is also ad
mitted. Hut, placards and signs spread all over the
Quad and sidewalks announced in letters a foot high
to the world that there was to be a bleacher rally at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Since the time of the
first Stanford band the student body has relied on
the band to lead the songs and give the pep to the
rallies, and even if all of the members could not be
there to create just the right harmony there would
have been a noise that resembled music and put the
fans on edge so that they might have extended them
selves. Yesterday, when the next-to-the-last bleach
er rally before the Big Game was held and more
than half the entire student body which is on the
"Farm" turned out to try to learn the new songs
which have been written, so that they could be put
over in good shape for the game with California,
the failure of enough musicians to attend left the
rooters unable to make a successful day of their
practice. This is more than unfortunate. It is dis
heartening.
Mere talking about the matter will not, however,
do any good. Things have looked just as adverse at
other times. Even more effort is needed now. The
yell leaders are doing their best for the perfection of
the cheering this year, and they are making good in
short time. They are putting much time on their
efforts and doing it cheerfully. The Rally and
Stunts Committee is working its hardest to - make
the stunts and yelling 011 November 19 a success.
The student body as a whole is behind the leaders
and the committee. The alumni in San Francisco
and other cities, who are in closer touch with the
University and happenings here than most students
imagine, are out all the time with money and sug
gestions. VVes Wilson was down at the rally yester
day with the copies of his "Alma Mater" song ready
to hear it sung, and to make corrections and give help
in learning it. Because there was no music there,
it could not be put over. As a result the student
ixxly as a whole does not know the song, and, more
than that, does not know the other new songs which
have been written in the last few weeks. But
sixteen more days remain before the "Big Game,"
and only one more rally is scheduled beside the foot
ball rally in the Assembly Hall. If these songs are
10 l>e learned so that they can be put across in a
way in which we as a Stanford crowd have in the
past put them over, we must get to work at once
011 them. Learn the words now and come to the
rally next Thursday. Don't think that because there
was no music this time that it will happen again.
When next Thursday afternoon comes the band will
be there and we can get behind it and sing the songs
so we will have them in shape by the nineteenth.
What do you say, gang? Let's go!

er rally before the Big Game was held and more
than half the entire student body which is on the
"Farm" turned out to try to learn the new songs
which have been written, so that they could be put
over in good shape for the game with California,
the failure of enough musicians to attend left the
rooters unable to make a successful day of their
practice. This is more than unfortunate. It is dis
heartening.
Mere talking about the matter will not, however,
do any good. Things have looked just as adverse at
other times. Even more effort is needed now. The
yell leaders are doing their best for the perfection of
the cheering this year, and they are making good in
short time. They are putting much time on their
efforts and doing it cheerfully. The Rally and
Stunts Committee is working its hardest to - make
the stunts and yelling 011 November 19 a success.
The student body as a whole is behind the leaders
and the committee. The alumni in San Francisco
and other cities, who are in closer touch with the
University and happenings here than most students
imagine, are out all the time with money and sug
gestions. VVes Wilson was down at the rally yester
day with the copies of his "Alma Mater" song ready
to hear it sung, and to make corrections and give help
in learning it. Because there was no music there,
it could not be put over. As a result the student
ixxly as a whole does not know the song, and, more
than that, does not know the other new songs which
have been written in the last few weeks. But
sixteen more days remain before the "Big Game,"
and only one more rally is scheduled beside the foot
ball rally in the Assembly Hall. If these songs are
10 l>e learned so that they can be put across in a
way in which we as a Stanford crowd have in the
past put them over, we must get to work at once
011 them. Learn the words now and come to the
rally next Thursday. Don't think that because there
was no music this time that it will happen again.
When next Thursday afternoon comes the band will
be there and we can get behind it and sing the songs
so we will have them in shape by the nineteenth.
What do you say, gang? Let's go!
More than a thousand men and women filled the
south bleachers at the football field yesterday after
noon to yell for the team and send it on its way to the
north. The rooters were filled with the old pep and
raised the sky with their vociferations. As far as
the purpose of the rally went, however, there was a
flat failure. Why? The band, announced to lead
the singing of the new songs that all are anxious to
learn, did not appear, it was not a day of practice
for the band. Admitted. No formal notice was
given to the band at the practice Tuesday that they
were to attend the rally as a band. This is also ad
mitted. Hut, placards and signs spread all over the
Quad and sidewalks announced in letters a foot high
to the world that there was to be a bleacher rally at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon. Since the time of the
first Stanford band the student body has relied on
the band to lead the songs and give the pep to the
rallies, and even if all of the members could not be
there to create just the right harmony there would
have been a noise that resembled music and put the
fans on edge so that they might have extended them
selves. Yesterday, when the next-to-the-last bleach
er rally before the Big Game was held and more
