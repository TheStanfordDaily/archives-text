There has been so much said on the subject of sup
|>orting the team that some mathematical wizard
could probably figure that the words, if placed end
to end, would reach from here to the moon and back
via Mars, or would weigh enough to counterbalance
the Woolworth Building; but as long as Stanford
has a varsity as worthy of backing as the one it has
now, there never can be too much said about support.
And one of the most powerful means of support is
one that is often overlooked.
This can be expressed in the one word, "optimism."
Not super-optimism, or overconfidence, but plain,
assertive optimism. "Wha'ts going to happen on
the nineteenth? Well, I'm no prophet, but Cali
fornia is going to be sorry it happened before it's

over," is a great contrast to the declarations of the
gloom-faced individuals who think, "Well, we may
have a chance, but you know they luave a wonderful
team up there, so it doesn't look too good." Sour
thoughts of the latter type should he discarded
hefreo their possessor acquires the i>ermanent look
of a hopeless life. He probably already has it, any
way.
Keep that "lucky hunch."' It counts for more
than many believe. Then that fighting spirit that
has beaten so many California teams in the past will
be an irresistible force, which, in the rooting section
as well as in the team, will help to carry the ball
down the field to a Cardinal victory on the nine
teenth of November. C. S. S.
o
A BIGGER CROWD OF WOMEN turned out at
the bleacher rally yesterday than ever before. The
"500" are behind athletics and are rooting for the
teams just as hard as the men. This is the support
that the activities need, the undivided support of all
the students, men and women. You've got the old
fight, "500." Keep it up.
