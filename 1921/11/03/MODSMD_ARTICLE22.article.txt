Dear Mr. Editor Evans: —As Cabbage-Head Irwin has
gone north to support Harry, I address myself to you,
with a colyumnfull, because last week I thought H. J. B.
would be prolific and only wrote half a one, and the stuff
they used to fill in was so rotten that people thought I
wrote it.

Those that wash on Monday may have all the week to
dry but I can't see any other merit to the cabbages on
that day. I can't see why Carl doesn't answer those
naughty epistles he gets from co-eds himself, instead
of using them for sllng-shots to pop Thursday with.

"Kabbage Kollum —I am a young co-ed of 25 (class,
not age). I know a young man who belongs to the
varsity squad—he takes me there every time Lila Lee
is on the bill. But it's two weeks now and he hasn't
yet told me he loves me. He hasn't even tried to kiss
me. What's wrong?—Q. E. D.
We don't answer these kinds of questions. The
Thursday Section Boss could probably give you all the
dope, from first-hand experience. Send him your pic
ture, anyway.

To show myself a constructive thiner and critic, I'll
tell him how he might have replied. He could have given
her a couple of hints, such as the trouble she took to
explain she was a freshman, was unnecessary, as the
fact was all too obvious. Then by the reductive pro
cess of logic he would have discerned it was her own
fault. Maybe she relied too heavily on the 4-1 ratio
and wouldn't ride in cheap cars and thereby frightened
off a worthy suppliant. So, Carl, I have indited for
your sake and hers a little moralizing pome, to-witless:

Joys That Come to the Poor
A moonlight night, a car and a girl,
But, ugh, a chaperone;
But aunty said she'd sit in the back,
And, thank you, sat alone.
'Twas truly the case, out of sight out of mind,
For the lights in the car were so dead,
That it wasn't perceived by the land behind,
How we spooned in the seat ahead.
We nestled up close, decided to hug her,
Held the kisses a moment or two,
'Till I thought the headlights winked to each
other, —
Dear Aunty behind never knew.
The lights were so poor, couldn't see from the rear
That 1 was kissing her ward,
And the bus was so noisy she couldn't hear.
For I wisely used a Ford.

Since I have achieved such blunderful success as sec
tion gang-boss of a cabbage garden, I have been de
luged with requests to write for campus publications,
that, is, or correspondence schools, and also to state
to the public my secrets of success. So, Mr. Evans, if
you will permit the rest of this colyum to be used for
a serious purpose; I shall give:

Ten Commandments For Poets
And the Muse spake all these words, saying:
I am thine art, thy life, which have brought thee out
of the land of commercialism, out of the hounse of
bondage.
Thou shalt put no other business before me.
Thou shalt not make unto thee any image, or any
likeness of anything that is of gold or of silver or of
drafts or of checks.
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor
them: for I thine art, thy life, am a jealous Muse,
visiting the wrath of the critics upon the children of
thy brain unto the third and fourth edition of them
that hate me.
But showing n omoney unto thousands of them that
love me, and keep my commandments.
Thou shalt not take the name "poetry" of thine art.
thy life, in vain; but the Muse will hold him guiltless
that useth the name of "verse."
Remember the savant's way, and keep it wholly.
Honour thine eraser and thy blue pencil; that the
days of thy published work may be long upon the land
which thine art, thy life, has given thee.
Thou shalt kill most of what thou writest.
Thou shalt not steal more than six bars.
Thou shalt not adulterate the quality of thy product
to fill space.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy critic.
Thou shalt not covet thy fellow-workman's words,
thou shalt not covet thy fellow-workman's phrasing,
nor his expressions of thought, nor anything that is thy
fellow-workman's.
