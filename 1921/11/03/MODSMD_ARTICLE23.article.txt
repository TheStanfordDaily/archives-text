# VARSITY TO SWIM OLYMPIC CLUBMEN ON FRIDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimming team
will present a strong front for the
fray with the Olympic Club, Friday
night, at the clubmen's pool, says
Coach Ernst Brandsten. The Cardinal
Squad will be well balanced with two
and three entries in every event.
For the first time in two years,
Captain A. Austin will be extended to
the limit in the 100-yard sprint.
Austin has been swimming the cen
tury in 58 seconds flat, without being
pushed, and when he and Lester
Smith of the Olympics hook up, the
closest race of the season should re
sult. Drake will also wear the Cardi
nal colors in the 100.
Pinkston will compete for Stanford
against the Olympic Club, in the div
ing, although he is ineligible for all
inter-collegiate meets. Brandsten is
counting on taking all three places in
the diving with Pinkston, White and
Snedden, and the clubmen will have
to work hard if they are to prevent
the Cardinal trio from making a clean
sweep.
Greppin is Stanford's only hope in
the 220. Like Austin, he has never
been forced to extend himself and
the race Friday night will show what
he can do under the stress of compe
tition, as he will have to make speed
if he is to defeat Lester Smith.
A practice game between the var
sity water polo team and the Olympic
Junior seven will be played after the
swimming meet. The results of the
game will go far in determining
which team will be the favorite in
the National Junior water polo cham
pionships on November 16, at San
Francisco. The Stanford team is com
posed entirely of veterans.
