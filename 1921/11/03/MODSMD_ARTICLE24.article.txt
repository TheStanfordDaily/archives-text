# IOTA SIGMA PI VOTES ON NATIONAL CHANGES
## 
### 
The revised constitution of the Na
tional Organization of lota Sigma Pi
was voted upon and accepted at a
meeting of the Stanford chapter, held
Tuesday night, in the Women's Club
house. The changes in the constitu
tion make effective a closer affilia
tion of the local chapters with the
National organization, and arrange for
more intimate communication between
the chapters themselves, so that the
society may be of more and actual
help to its individual members.
Margaret Caii,amith, '22, was ap
pointed chairman of the committee
to make arrangements about furnish
ing a room in the Chemistry Building
for the use of all the women in the
department. The room available is
on the third floor of the building, and
will probably be |ready some time
during the winter quarter.
It was also voted to send in the
money required of each chapter for
the establishment of a national schol
arship in Chemistry to be open to
Seniors in the department. The
scholarship has been founded to en
courage greater interest and effort
among the women who are studying
chemistry in the various universities
of the country.
