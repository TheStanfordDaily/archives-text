# "Foreign Students" To Be Subject of Y.W.C.A. Talk
## 
### 
Miss Henrietta Thomson, secretary of
the International Students' Association,
will give an informal talk on "Foreign
Students" at the Y. W. C. A. meeting
Thursday afternoon at 5 o'clock in the
Women's Clubhouse. Miss Thomson
lias been abroad and, through managing
a student foyer for foreign-born women
at Berkeley, she keeps in intimate touch
with the students of many countries.
American college men and women, ac
cording to Miss Thomson, are markedly
lacking in an intelligent interest in mod
ern world problems; she will discuss
the attitude of the students of other
nations toward current problems.
The meeting will serve as a prelimi
nary to the foreign student relief drive
which will not begin until the first of
December. The Y. W. C. A. is espe
cially eager for its members to turn out
for this meeting, which is open to the
public.
