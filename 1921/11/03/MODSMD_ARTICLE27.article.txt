# ORGANIZATION OF STANFORD R. O. T. C. SOON SAYS COLLINS
## 
### 
Within the coming two weeks, the
Stanford unit of the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps, will be definitely or
ganized. Major Collins announces that
student officers, both commissioned and
non-commissioned, will be chosen to
serve in the unit, which will be a two
battery battalion.
The commissioned officers will be
picked from among those men who are
how engaged in the work of the second
year of the advanced course. They will
consist of a major, who will command
the battalion; a captain, who will serve
as battalion adjutant; two captains, one
in command of each battery of the bat
talion ; and four lieutenants, two at
tached to each battery.
Under an arrangement with the Uni
versity, the commissioned officers will
receive $20 a quarter for their services,
the amount being equivalent to their
room rent for the same period. This is
in addition to the ration allowance, ap
proximately $15 a month, which is paid
by the government to all students taking
the advanced military course.
Non-commissioned officers will be
picked from among the men in the first
year advanced course and in the second
year of the basic course. Sergeants will
be picked from the former group, and
corporals from the latter.
Three men who were student officers
in the R. O. T. C. last year are available
for appointment at the present time.
They are Lientenants McManaman,
Talbert and Hayne.
It is unlikely that the whole Stanford
unit will be maneuvered as an integral
organization until the spring quarter,
when the men now in the first half of
the basic course will have finished the
mounted work .instruction necessary to
the proper exercise of their duties in a
battalion.
