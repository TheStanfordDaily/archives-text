# COACH CANNING GIVES ANALYSIS OF PLAY ON LINE
## Second Powell-Nestoria Talk Gives Details of Work at Guard and Tackle Positions 
### 
The best lecture Professor Canning
lias ever given," was the unanimous
opinion of those who heard the varsity
line coach deliver the second of a series
of four lectures on the "Technique of
American Football," conducted under
the auspices of Walter Powell and Nes
toria Debating Society, in room 214, last
night.
With clear-cut organization of subject
and thorough grasp of detail, Canning
traced line play lirst on the defense and
then on the offense. He outlined dif
ferent systems of play and the func
tions of the different positions. He ex
ploded numerous prevalent misconcep
tions, such as the idea that men play
opposite men of the same title, and that
the line should "play down."
In showing how to "smother" opposi

les and guards. A tackle, he declared,
must be aggressive, heady, able to get
through and stay on his feet until the
play is over. A guard must be true to
his name, he must go straight ahead
and never, never give ground. He must
not leave his territory no matter what
the opportunity. If guards go back it
is a sign of green men, poor coaching
or a beaten team. In the last quarter
Saturday the guards of the whipped
O. A. C. team gave ground.
"If the men are equal in talent,
strength and coaching, the game will be
stalemate, what it is meant to be," he
continued.
In offensive play he compared the
Minnesota system of a slow-moving
stone wall that carries everything until
if secures a break, while the backs wait,
with the theory that the business of
line play is to open holes by a sharp
assault at the point where the play is
to be.
These holes, he pointed out, arc of
necessity small, that while early in the
season Stanford backs thought line holes
should resemble folding doors they
they have learned to force themselves
through narrow slits and keep going for
good runs. Wilcox, he explained, went
through a hole so narrow Saturday he
