# URGES SPACE IN BLEACHERS FOR WOMEN ROOTERS
## Emily Wardman Sees Cause For Women's Attitude in Active Participation Lack 
### 
As a direct result of the campaign un
dertaken by the Skull and Snakes So
ciety last week when speeches were
made at all the houses on the row urg
ing support of the athletic teams, a
new and awakened interest among the
Stanford women has manifested itself,
concessions made by the action of the
Executive Council in placing the women
on the same footing as the men in re
gard to games, bleacher rallies and the
like, marks a new era in the activity of
the Stanford body and the Stanford
women in particular.
The following letter, received by the
Executive Council from Miss Emily
Wardman of Delta Gamma, expresses
the attitude of the women which has
resulted in the change in policy. The
suggestions which Miss Wardman made
were subsequently adopted by the
Council:
"My Dear Mr. Evans:
"Not having the pleasure of knowing
you, I am going to put down on paper
what I would rather have said. Please
don't think me the proverbial kicker or
knocker. Am merely getting interested
(after being here half a year) in Stan
ford and the student government, and
have observed something which I be
lieve if remedied would help a matter
you were speaking about not many
moons ago at Roble.
"You were urging the women to back
athletics.
"Mr. Evans, I believe they would be
out and pull harder if you gave them
half a chance. Do you realize that you
reserve the best and largest section on
the stand for the men? And that the
public is allowed to' come in any place
besides that—and they do ! —and the
women take what is left.
"I'm not arguing votes for women —
just a comparison. 1 transferred from
California. Up there we women always
had a section reserved near that of the
men and it was always filled. My sug
gestion is that if you would try that
here, not only in football, but in all
other athletics as well, you would find
the girls turn out more. Let them know
that there is to be such a section. It
doesn't need to be the best. I'm not try
ing to give that impression, only ask
ing you to give the girls a chance to
make good.
"If you want, say the section will be
held for them till a certain time, and
then opened to the public. What is more,
if tickets are sold, make them show their
student body cards, too, and then it will
be Stanford women in the section.
"I hope you won't take this letter in
the wrong way. I'm so mad about foot
ball and all athletics, and coming from
California, where the women were in
thing and not so completely ignored—
well, I just had to say what was in my
head.
"I can't and never will be a meek
co-ed, nor a knocker; I just want to do
my part, if you don't like any sugges
tions, it's alright.
"Sincerely,
Emily Wardman."
President Dan Evans stalled today
that any constructive criticism, such as
that offered by Miss Wardman, will be
welcomed by the Executive Council at
any time.
"The setting aside of a definite sec
tion of the bleachers for the women at
the games and the rallies marks a new
era in the life of Stanford, a life in
which the women shall have a definite
chance to show their enthusiasm and
their loyalty to Stanford in the same
way as the men," stated Evans.

ford and the student government, and
have observed something which I be
lieve if remedied would help a matter
you were speaking about not many
moons ago at Roble.
"You were urging the women to back
athletics.
"Mr. Evans, I believe they would be
out and pull harder if you gave them
half a chance. Do you realize that you
reserve the best and largest section on
the stand for the men? And that the
public is allowed to' come in any place
besides that—and they do ! —and the
women take what is left.
"I'm not arguing votes for women —
just a comparison. 1 transferred from
California. Up there we women always
had a section reserved near that of the
men and it was always filled. My sug
gestion is that if you would try that
here, not only in football, but in all
other athletics as well, you would find
the girls turn out more. Let them know
that there is to be such a section. It
doesn't need to be the best. I'm not try
ing to give that impression, only ask
ing you to give the girls a chance to
make good.
"If you want, say the section will be
held for them till a certain time, and
then opened to the public. What is more,
if tickets are sold, make them show their
student body cards, too, and then it will
be Stanford women in the section.
"I hope you won't take this letter in
the wrong way. I'm so mad about foot
ball and all athletics, and coming from
California, where the women were in
thing and not so completely ignored—
well, I just had to say what was in my
head.
"I can't and never will be a meek
co-ed, nor a knocker; I just want to do
my part, if you don't like any sugges
tions, it's alright.
"Sincerely,
Emily Wardman."
President Dan Evans stalled today
that any constructive criticism, such as
that offered by Miss Wardman, will be
welcomed by the Executive Council at
any time.
"The setting aside of a definite sec
tion of the bleachers for the women at
the games and the rallies marks a new
era in the life of Stanford, a life in
which the women shall have a definite
chance to show their enthusiasm and
their loyalty to Stanford in the same
way as the men," stated Evans.
As a direct result of the campaign un
dertaken by the Skull and Snakes So
ciety last week when speeches were
made at all the houses on the row urg
ing support of the athletic teams, a
new and awakened interest among the
Stanford women has manifested itself,
concessions made by the action of the
Executive Council in placing the women
on the same footing as the men in re
gard to games, bleacher rallies and the
like, marks a new era in the activity of
the Stanford body and the Stanford
women in particular.
The following letter, received by the
Executive Council from Miss Emily
Wardman of Delta Gamma, expresses
the attitude of the women which has
resulted in the change in policy. The
suggestions which Miss Wardman made
were subsequently adopted by the
Council:
"My Dear Mr. Evans:
"Not having the pleasure of knowing
you, I am going to put down on paper
what I would rather have said. Please
don't think me the proverbial kicker or
knocker. Am merely getting interested

ford and the student government, and
