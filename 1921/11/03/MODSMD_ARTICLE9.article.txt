# URGES SPACE IN BLEACHERS FOR WOMEN ROOTERS
## Emily Wardman Sees Cause For Women's Attitude in Active Participation Lack 
### 
As a direct result of the campaign un
dertaken by the Skull and Snakes So
ciety last week when speeches were
made at all the houses on the row urg
ing support of the athletic teams, a
new and awakened interest among the
Stanford women has manifested itself,
concessions made by the action of the
Executive Council in placing the women
on the same footing as the men in re
gard to games, bleacher rallies and the
like, marks a new era in the activity of
the Stanford body and the Stanford
women in particular.
The following letter, received by the
Executive Council from Miss Emily
Wardman of Delta Gamma, expresses
the attitude of the women which has
resulted in the change in policy. The
suggestions which Miss Wardman made
were subsequently adopted by the
Council:
"My Dear Mr. Evans:
"Not having the pleasure of knowing
you, I am going to put down on paper
what I would rather have said. Please
don't think me the proverbial kicker or
knocker. Am merely getting interested
(after being here half a year) in Stan
ford and the student government, and
have observed something which I be
lieve if remedied would help a matter
you were speaking about not many
moons ago at Roble.
"You were urging the women to back
athletics.
"Mr. Evans, I believe they would be
out and pull harder if you gave them
half a chance. Do you realize that you
reserve the best and largest section on
the stand for the men? And that the
public is allowed to' come in any place
