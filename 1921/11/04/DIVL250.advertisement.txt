| Two Boxes $ 1
Wilson's Candy
Only one t oa PATRON —and it would be well to hurry, for
such fine values will not last very long.
Box No. 1 is a beautifully designed Art Metal container—
filled with ASSORTED BUTTERCUP TAFFIES.
Box No. 2 is a real treat—one-half pound
MILK CHOCOLATES
the very best grade made —the kind we are proud to sell
because they're so good—EVERYONE LIKES THEM.
