# STADIUM GIVEN FINAL TOUCHES; TURF IS READY
## Grass to be Cut Soon—Seats Being Numbered — Aisles Painting—Little Yet to Do 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Stanford's Stadium is practically com
pleted.
Five and one-half months from the
date of the ground-breaking, the largest
enterprise ever undertaken by the
alumni and students of the university,
stands completed, a monument to the
Stanford way of accomplishing big
things—quietly and thoroughly, work
ing steadily until the goal is reached.
From the top of the western slope, the
spectator is amazed at the collossal size
of the Stadium. Seemingly hundreds
of feet below, the green of the turf
spreads, with large splotches of brown
where the new grass has not yet hid
den the newly laid clay of the playing
field. Circling the playing field is the
red-colored track, which sets off the
green of the turf. The eastern end of
the huge horse-shoe opens out to a
flat runway, providing a straightaway
for the 200-yard run; here also the
scoreboard will probably be placed, and
later, the training houses.
Through this gap in the bowl can be
seen the mountains of the coast range,
with Mount Hamilton rising above the
surrounding peaks like a towering sen
tinel.
White seats, row after row, rise to the
very edge of the embankment; with
green aisles and the red balustrade at
the bottom, seeming like a huge checker
board, ready for the play to begin.
Seen from the outer side, the huge
mound is just as impressive. Green
and brown slopes, cut by green rows
of steps, guarded at top and bottom by
wire fences with green posts; all this
in a setting of brown fields, surrounded
by green trees —truly a picture worthy
of an artist's skill.
Sam McDonald, in whose hands the
care of the Stadium rests, expressed the
idea of the entire picture when he said:
"The Stadium docs not look like the
work of a few months; it seems that it
has been here for years, and that it be
longs here."
Very little remains to oc done to put
the entire project in excellent shape for
the immense crowds that are expected
on the day of November 19. The seats
are now being numbered; the gates are
nearly in place; the road that skirts the
base of the structure is in the process
of levelling; nothing remains to be done
but "odds and ends."
Good luck has featured the construc
tion of the Stadium. No inclement
weather has hindered tho speeding of
the work and accidents have been few
and entirely of a minor character. The
grass in the two weeks that it has been
planted has progressed until it is nearly
ready for the first cutting.
No one group of men can be given
credit for the completion of the Sta
dium, but the Board of Athletic Con
trol, the Engineering Department, with
the active support of alumni and stu
dents, all shared in making a success of
Stanford's biggest undertaking.
