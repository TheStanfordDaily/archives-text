# STADIUM GIVEN FINAL TOUCHES; TURF IS READY
## Grass to be Cut Soon—Seats Being Numbered — Aisles Painting—Little Yet to Do

Stanford's Stadium is practically com
pleted.
Five and one-half months from the
date of the ground-breaking, the largest
enterprise ever undertaken by the
alumni and students of the university,
stands completed, a monument to the
Stanford way of accomplishing big
things—quietly and thoroughly, work
ing steadily until the goal is reached.
From the top of the western slope, the
spectator is amazed at the collossal size
of the Stadium. Seemingly hundreds
of feet below, the green of the turf
spreads, with large splotches of brown
where the new grass has not yet hid

red-colored track, which sets off the
green of the turf. The eastern end of
the huge horse-shoe opens out to a
flat runway, providing a straightaway
for the 200-yard run; here also the
scoreboard will probably be placed, and

with Mount Hamilton rising above the
surrounding peaks like a towering sen

White seats, row after row, rise to the
very edge of the embankment; with
green aisles and the red balustrade at
the bottom, seeming like a huge checker
board, ready for the play to begin.
Seen from the outer side, the huge
mound is just as impressive. Green
and brown slopes, cut by green rows
of steps, guarded at top and bottom by
wire fences with green posts; all this
in a setting of brown fields, surrounded
by green trees —truly a picture worthy
of an artist's skill.
Sam McDonald, in whose hands the
care of the Stadium rests, expressed the
idea of the entire picture when he said:
"The Stadium docs not look like the
work of a few months; it seems that it
has been here for years, and that it be
longs here."
