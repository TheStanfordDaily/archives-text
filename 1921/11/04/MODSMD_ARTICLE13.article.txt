# SIX WEEKS MORE FOR PAVILION COMPLETION
## 
### 
From six to eight weeks is the time
set for the completion of the basketball
pavilion.
The most effort is being expended
now on the completion of the roof and
the spring floor. The roof has been
completely covered with tar paper, on
top of which the tiles are to be laid.
Braces to which the tiles are fastened
will be placed within the next week.
Construction of the spring floor is a
laborious process, according to the fore
man in charge of the work. Wooden
sleepers are first imbedded in a con
crete base. Llpon these two-by-four
boards are spiked, to serve as the foun
dation of the joists that run perpen
dicular to them. Again, more joists are
to be placed upon these, and upon this
the flooring is to rest. Hardwood will
be used throughout the building for the
floors.
Plumbing and wiring is being rapidly
completed. Most of the work on the
walls is done, and the remaining work,
with the exception of the floor and roof,
will be concerned with adding the finish
ing touches.
A notable feature of the main room
is the absence of a large number of pil
lars supporting the roof, but four being
used for this purpose.
At present a force of twenty men are
employed in the construction of the pa
vilion.
