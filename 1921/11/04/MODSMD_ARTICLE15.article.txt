# HUGE MARCHING RALLY TO GREET TEAM MONDAY
## Red Flares Will Light Up Line Of March; Automobiles Barred 
### 
Celebrating the return home of Stan
ford's football squad from Seattle, a
monster marching rally will be held
Monday night. The committee in
charge has worked out most of the
details, and with every student in the
university participating, the event will
be one of the largest of its kind ever
staged here.
Every man on the campus who has
the use of his two feet is expected to
join in the march down to the station.
The parade will Btart at 7:30', in three
sections, which meeting at the Eng
lish corner, will tramp down to Palo
Alto in one huge mob. All Row men
will come in one section, led by As
sistant Yell Leader Connolly, and the
Sequoia men will form a third group,
under assistant Yell Leader Minsky.
The use of automobiles has been
strictly prohibited by the Rally Com
mittee, in order that the marching
line may reach its maximum strength.
Anv men seen in automobiles will be

dealt with by a committee already se
lected.
The band will leave from the Phi
Gamma Delta house and join the line
of march at the English corner. Red
flares will be set along the entire
route of march. Every gun, whistle,
tom-tom, or other noise-maker should
be present and in working order, ac
cording to the Rally Committee.
All the women, both from the Row
and from Roble, will meet at the Roble
car station, where a number of spe
cial cars will be awaiting to take
them down to Palo Alto. There will
also be cars for other campus resi
dents that wish to attend.
After the arrival of the team, the
rally will wend its way up University
Avenue, behind a decorated float on
which the team will be riding. As a
good deal of interest has been aroused
in Palo Alto over the event, it is
expected that the sides of the street
will be lined with Palo Altoans, curious
to witness what promises to be a new
mark set .'for noise-making demon
strations.
