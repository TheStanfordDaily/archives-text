# The 						Spirit of the Law.

The presence of 'road houses" situated along roads
!>etween Palo Alto and various other points is the
main objection in denying motoring to University
women. They were forbidden to ride unchaperoned
after 7:30 several years ago when these "road
houses" were becoming prevalent along the state
highways.
These places, for the most part not dangerous in
themselves, were prohibited as a precautionary meas
ure. However, the women ever since have been de
nied the privilege of riding anywhere except between
the campus and Palo Alto. This was done with a
view to protecting the University as well as the in
dividuals involved.
It is clearly a case of the whole being unnecessarily
restricted for the sake of the few. It is a fact that
those who have disregarded the regulation, the ma
jority have done so only because of the novelty of the
escapade and perhaps the added attraction felt by
tTie culprit breaking the law. Of this number only
a few have actually stopped along the way.
This indicates that the spirit in which women re
gard the rule is the factor on which the success or
failure of its amendment depends.
If the women as a unit were to consider it in the
light of a matter of honor both to themselves and
to the University not to appear at resorts which in
themselves may be harmless but where their pres
ence may occasion criticism, it seems reasonable that
the motor rule should be altered to permit riding
upon the highways, providing that there is no stop
ping at such places en route.
The women have their government in their own
hands. So far they have proved their ability to use
the powers delgated to them. It is their attitude
toward the spirit as well as the letter of the law
which should be made to guarantee a revision of the
present regulation. Initiative must come from them.
