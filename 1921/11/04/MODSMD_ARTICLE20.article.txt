Performance by the players on the Cardinal eleven
and vocal expression on the part of the Stanford
rooters at the Oregon Aggie game last Saturday fur
nished ample proof that the spirit of fight which
has characterized the denizens of the "Farm" from
the beginning has in no way diminished. At a time
in the ga me when things did not look bright for a
victory, the fans rose to their feet and told the
straining team on the field that the support of the
student body was in no way waning because of a
score having been put over by the opposition. The
wearers of the Cardinal jerseys probably could not
hear what the yells and calls of encouragement were,
but they did know from the volume of sound that
the confidence of their pals and mates in the bleach
ers remained unshaken, and were nerved to greater
effort and keener work until the game was snatched
from a possible tie by a brilliantly executed intercep
tion of a forward pass.
This spirit as shown Saturday is what has helped
to pull teams representing the Cardinal out of the
bottom of holes in contests since the founding of the
University. There is one flaw that has developed in
the cheering lately, however, which cuts down the
value of the Stanford rooting section's support to
the team. It is the fact that some of the rooters
leave their seats previous to the singing of "Hail.
Sanford, Hail." Very likely this is due in a great
measure to thoughtlessness on the part of most of
those who do it, but the confusion which results from
some trying to get out of the exits and others
shouting at them to stop breaks the solidity of the
section and makes it difficult for the yell leaders to
start the organized cheering. Stanford is unique in
the custom of KVERYONE remaining to join in
the cheering after the game, and it is up to the mem
bers of the student body to perpetuate this custom.
This traditional sticking together in time of victory
and defeat has brought fame to Stanford in the
past and will bring much more in the future. A
few more minutes spent at the game will not be hard

on anyone, in the ordinary course of events, and
will go a long ways toward making a more efficient
display, and consequently more favorable impression
on the visitors.
