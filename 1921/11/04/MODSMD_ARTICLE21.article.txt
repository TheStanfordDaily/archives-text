"Dear Cabbages:—Noticing that the Daily prints sound
advice whenever received, I beg to sound-off as well. Al
though it seems a rather doubtful pleasure to know you, I
do, and for that reason, put down on paper lots less than
I would rather say.
"The men are not behind women's athletics as they
should be. Their cheering is not at all organized and
even those who would back athletics are turned back.
"Mr. Cabbages, I believe they would be out and pull
harder if you gave them half a chance. A stand should
be reserved for them even if it must be bodily snatched
from the public. All we ask is a "chanct." We can
make good.
"I hope you won't take that the wrong way. I don't
want to be a knocker, but —well, —you know how it is.
"Sincerely,
J. JONES."

Now isn't that enough to wrench the heart of even
so hardy a rough as the Thursday Section Boss. How
can a meek co-ed resist voting for archery bleachers
now.

That's fair. Too fair to miss.

HO HUM, BACK TO WORK!
"There goes Ed. Darn good guy."
"I'm off him. We got in a fight and he threw my
sweater in the mud."
"Where were you?"
"In it."

Ev. Ree Body contributing with a vengeance today as
per announcement. Now that the wit and humor has
been passed safely the company will kindly buckle on
the poetry gas masks.

If this keeps on much longer, unlike Harvey T. Wood
ruff's Wake, we shall be forced to do without any "Help,
HELP, H E L P!"

There was a young fellow named Bliss,
Who wanted to learn how to kiss;
But he tried in the dark,
And thus missed his mark,
And so his first hit was a-miss. , /

She knows her eyes are spotty green,
She's wise to her pug nose, no doubt.
Her hands of red she's often seen,
Of course, she notices her mouth.
• * •
And yet she snaps for reptile slush,
Of Venus, stars, buds, tinkling bells —
It makes her sallow cheeks to blush,
So what the, what the. what the duece?

"Liquid Air Display as Chem Smoker." —Science has
done it again. No more dry speeches.
* * *
Snake claims to be in impossible
predicament because worm swiped
hand-bag from sorority porch.
Should have known better than to
put his only suspenders in such a
place.

The new song ought to reign in the bleachers. From
the amount of Hail, it's a cloudburst.

Left Over from Yesterday
Told the Cal fellows down at this debating league
conference, Friday, that we sure wanted to see them
trounce U. S. C.. Reply: Can't wish it any more than
we do. Retort: Yes, we do. First Replier: Prove it.
Retorter: Want to see U. S. C. beaten if it puts every
Cal man in the hospital for the rest of the year to do it.

Told the Cal fellows down at this debating league
conference, Friday, that we sure wanted to see them
trounce U. S. C.. Reply: Can't wish it any more than
we do. Retort: Yes, we do. First Replier: Prove it.
Retorter: Want to see U. S. C. beaten if it puts every
Cal man in the hospital for the rest of the year to do it.

"Dear Cabbages:—Noticing that the Daily prints sound
advice whenever received, I beg to sound-off as well. Al
though it seems a rather doubtful pleasure to know you, I
do, and for that reason, put down on paper lots less than
I would rather say.
"The men are not behind women's athletics as they
should be. Their cheering is not at all organized and
even those who would back athletics are turned back.
"Mr. Cabbages, I believe they would be out and pull
harder if you gave them half a chance. A stand should
be reserved for them even if it must be bodily snatched
from the public. All we ask is a "chanct." We can
make good.
"I hope you won't take that the wrong way. I don't
want to be a knocker, but —well, —you know how it is.
"Sincerely,
J. JONES."
