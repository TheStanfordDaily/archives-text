Ihe women will tomorrow he given an oppor
tunity to back an activity entirely their own in the
swimming meet with the University of California,
which takes place at Roble Pool tomorrow morning.
This will he one of the biggest events of the year
for women's athletics. It is the only intercollegiate
competition in swimming in which the women will
engage, and the fact that the events will be by
classes should stimulate class enthusiasm.
The women have not failed to give active response
to all forms of University endeavor, and have shown
themselves eager to make the most of all the oppor
tunities offered them for proving their interest.
Now comes their chance to give united and whole
hearted support to one of their own chief forms of
activityâ€”athletics.
A large number of participants have done their
share in the practice and training which they have
observed during the past weeks. Tomorrow when
the women from the University of California, swim
mers and rooters, arrive, they should be greeted at
Roble Pool by the women of Stanford en masse.
There is no reason why any woman in the Uni
versity should not be there to take part, actively or
from the side-lines, in their meet tomorrow.

TOMORROW MORNING THE FRESHMEN
play Lincoln High School from Los Angeles. The
freshman team this year is one of the best that has
turned out in a long time and is worthy of your
support. In the absence of the Varsity do not for
get that there is a football game on the campus.
This is the last freshman game before their "Big
Game."
