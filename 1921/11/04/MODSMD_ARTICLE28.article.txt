# BULLETIN IS ISSUED ON SCHOLARSHIP BY REGISTRAR'S OFFICE
## Statistics for Probation and Disqualification Gathered Together for First Time 
### 
For the first time the University has
gathered together all the regulations
concerning deficiencies in scholarship,
probation, disqualification, reinstatement
and related matters. They have been
published in a short, two-page pamphlet
which may be secured on application at
the registrar's office.
The following table indicates the exact
deficiency in grade points at the end of
any quarter which will result in proba
tion or disqualification: '
Quarter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
Probation 66554433221 11
Disqualification 20 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 5 4 3 2 1
Thus, if at the end of the seventh f
quarter the student is four or more
grade points below the required average
(one grade point for every registered
unit) the result is probation; if the de
ficiency reaches twelve or more, disquali
fication results.
One paragraph explains exactly what
probation is and how it effects the stu
dents' extra-curricular activities. An
other section deals with reinstatement.
It states specifically those things which
a disqualified student should and should
not do if he expects to be reinstated.
Mid-quarter reports are sent out one
month before the end of each quarter
to those students whose work is unsat
isfactory. Graduate students are not
subject to the regulations as to defi
ciency in general average.
A student who incurs probation for
three successive quarters (ignoring
those quarters in which he is not reg
istered and also the first two quarters
in the University) is thereby disqualified.

(a) First and second quarters in the
