# OLYMPIC SOCCERITES TO PLAY CARDS NEXT
## Fast City Club Will Tangle Once More With Maloney's Eleven on the Local Turf 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer eleven will
be in the limelight tomorrow when the
Cardinal squad will go up against the
eleven sent down by the Olympic Club.
The game should be fast and furious,
as the winning of the game practically
cinches the leadership of the University
and Club Soccer League. Action will
start on the football turf at 2 :45.
Stanford, from the soccer standpoint,
faces a critical period, as the Olympic
Club at present leads the University
and Club League. Stanford is running
the Winged O a tight race for the
championship of the league,, and while
dope rather favors the San Francisco
players, the Cardinal squad is by no
means going up against great odds. If
the Cards win the game they will lead
the league; if they lose, the best that
Stanford can hope for is to beat the
California varsity out of second place.
The varsity will not be fighting with
its back against the wall. Coach Ma
loney has been putting the forwards
through stiff workouts in an endeavor
to strengthen the Card scoring machine.
New combinations have been worked out
during the past week. Dwight has been
put in as outside right and from all
prospects it looks as though he would
start the game tomorrow. George Clark
is playing inside right. He did some
good work in the American Legion game
and has been showing up well all week.
Peavy will be in his old place of center
forward. He will be assisted on the
left by Mead and Elmore. Robinson is
the new addition to the backfield. He
plays center half. Captain Gorman will
hold down the opposition of right half
while either Taylor or Walthers will be
on the left side of the field of action.
With Hays and Mendonca at the full
back positions and Masters at goal, the
Olympics should have a hard time scor
ing. The team, as usual, will play the
offensive game.
As a preliminary for the meet, the
second varsity will meet the freshmen
in a practice game.
