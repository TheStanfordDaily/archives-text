## 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimming team
will invade the home territory of the
Olympics this evening, in a dual meet,
in the Post Street pool. Coach Brand

of the contest, but if the Cardinal
mermen show up as they are expected
to, the Olympic clubmen are going to
have to hustle to carry off first hon

The race that is attracting attention
in swimming circles of the bay region,
is the 100 yards between A. Austin
of Stanford, and Lester Smith of the
Winged "0." The edge rests with the
latter, as he is credited with a sec

Fletcher in the back and breast
strokes is in fine form and will make
anyone who beats him extend himself
to the limit. If Hall swims for the
Olympics, the Stanford boy may have
to content himself with second place
in the breast stroke. Pinkston, White,
and Snedden, are expected to make a
clean sweep of the diving.
Stanford has a fast water polo team
entered for the practice fray with the
clubmen, after the swimming meet.
Drake, Strauss and Miller in the for

and expert in throwing the ball into
