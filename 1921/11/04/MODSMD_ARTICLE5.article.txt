# VARSITY SWIMMERS WILL GIVE OLYMPIC CLUB HARD TUSSLE
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimming team
will invade the home territory of the
Olympics this evening, in a dual meet,
in the Post Street pool. Coach Brand
sten is uncertain as to the outcome
of the contest, but if the Cardinal
mermen show up as they are expected
to, the Olympic clubmen are going to
have to hustle to carry off first hon
ors.
The race that is attracting attention
in swimming circles of the bay region,
is the 100 yards between A. Austin
of Stanford, and Lester Smith of the
Winged "0." The edge rests with the
latter, as he is credited with a sec
ond's better time than Austin, in ftie
century event.
Fletcher in the back and breast
strokes is in fine form and will make
anyone who beats him extend himself
to the limit. If Hall swims for the
Olympics, the Stanford boy may have
to content himself with second place
in the breast stroke. Pinkston, White,
and Snedden, are expected to make a
clean sweep of the diving.
Stanford has a fast water polo team
entered for the practice fray with the
clubmen, after the swimming meet.
Drake, Strauss and Miller in the for
ward positions are good swimmers
and expert in throwing the ball into
the net. As the Olympic Juniors are
regarded as the favorites for the na
tional title in the championships to
be held at San Francisco, the latter
•part of the month, results of the game
will show the comparative strength of
the Cardinal seVen.
