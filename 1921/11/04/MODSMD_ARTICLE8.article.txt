# DOPE PREDICTS SURE DEFEAT FOR SUN DODGERS IN CLASH WITH CARD SQUAD TOMORROW
## Babes Play Last Preliminary Game On Local Turf at 9:30 A.M. with Lincoln High School Eleven 
### 
Gene Van Gent and his Stanford
Cardinals are tonight in Seattle, Wash
ashington, awaiting the second Pacific
Coast conference football game of the
season tomorrow afternoon with Enoch
Bagshaw's Sun Dodgers.
Stanford should win. The dope says
so. The Oregon Aggies defeated Wash
ington 24 to 0. Stanford beat the Ag
gies 14 to 7.
But Gene Van Gent, neither an op
timist nor a pessimist, is going to take
no chances when his men run on to
Washington field tomorrow afternoon as
a part of Stadium Day at the northern
university.
Stanford must win to clear the slate
and make the big affair in the new
Stanford Stadium, on November 19, an
out and out struggle with the coast
football supremacy at stake. Van Gent
will consequently start the strongest
lineup that he can, as Washington will
be a harder team to beat on their own
field than they were at Corvallis two
weeks ago for the Aggies.
But the game will be a hard one. It
is not known yet whether Art Wilcox,
the star Card halfback, will be able to
play tomorrow. No news reached here
today from the varsity. Wilcox boarded
the train at Palo Alto Wednesday night
in poor condition. An injury that he
had received early in the season to his
side had become aggravated and h\e
was having difficulty getting his breath.
Along with Wilcox is Carter, the big
tackle who has been perhaps Stanford's
most consistent man in the line this sea
son. Carter hurt his knee badly in the
Aggie game. The injury is better but
if the big fellow gets it bumped hard
again he may be out for the season.
It is believed, however, that both men
will be able to start the game and as
soon as the Cards have scored Van Gent
will take them out. That seems to be
the logical move.
Stanford went north for the Wash
ington game last year about even on the
dope. The game was one of the best
of the season and was won when "Dink"
Templcton dropped one over in the sec
ond quarter. That was all of the scor
ing.
Washington has two men that Stan-

Tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock the
Stanford freshmen meet Lincoln Higli
from Los Angeles on the home turf, in
the last preliminary game before the
clash with the Bruin Babes at Berkeley
next Friday.
Despite a growing hospital list, Coach
Seay will be able to put out a formidable
eleven against the southerners and ex
pects to take an easy scalp. Helser,
Shipke, Dole and Wideman are listed
among the cripples, although Dole and
Shipke will probably be in the play to
morrow.
Last evening the Babes scrimmaged
with the second Varsity and boast of
giving Van Gent's second stringers a
good trimming. Coach Seay started his
first-string lineup and then shifted to
give every man a chance. Kraft, play
ing quarterback for the second varsity,
showed up to good advantage. He is a
fighter and field general of ability. The
skilful way in- which he handled ten
men who did not make even a good
bluff of knowing the signals brought
much favorable comment from the side
lines. Helser, freshman tackle who has
been giving Shipke a hard race for po
sition, was injured severely during the
play. He had been out of play for sev
eral days with wrenched muscles in his
leg, and last night's injury will put him
out for the rest of the season.
Lincoln High made a good showing
in football last season and entered this
season with high hopes of taking south
ern prep-school honors. They have a
number of crack individual players and
attribute their defeat by both Manual
Arts and Los Angeles High elevens as
the result of a slump. They come pre
pared for a battle.
Dennis and Howard will not don the
striped jerseys tomorrow. They are not
in the best of shape and Coach Seay
does not want to risk any additions to
his cripple list. The men will probably
start: Janssen, le: Fuller, re; Shipke,
It; Dole, rt; Neill, lg; Mcrorie, rg; Wil
liams, c ; Wheat, qb; Wittenberg, lh ;
Gilliland, rh; Cuddeback, fb.
Admission to the game wiill be 25
cents or student body cards.
ford must watch. Ray Echman, the
skipper of the Sun Dodgers, has a repu
tation in the northwest as a clever
broken field runner and a master of
football tactics. Glenn Galligan, right
end, is rated as a stellar end. Against
the Oregon Aggies he caught two sen
sational passes and on one occasion had
a clear field in front of him but slipped
and fell in the sawdust field.
As it looks tonight both Stanford and
California should win tomorrow. That
would make the setting perfect for the
Big Game here November 19.

and make the big affair in the new
Stanford Stadium, on November 19, an
out and out struggle with the coast
football supremacy at stake. Van Gent
will consequently start the strongest
lineup that he can, as Washington will
be a harder team to beat on their own
field than they were at Corvallis two
weeks ago for the Aggies.
But the game will be a hard one. It
is not known yet whether Art Wilcox,
the star Card halfback, will be able to
play tomorrow. No news reached here
today from the varsity. Wilcox boarded
the train at Palo Alto Wednesday night
in poor condition. An injury that he
had received early in the season to his
side had become aggravated and h\e
was having difficulty getting his breath.
Along with Wilcox is Carter, the big
tackle who has been perhaps Stanford's
most consistent man in the line this sea
son. Carter hurt his knee badly in the
Aggie game. The injury is better but
if the big fellow gets it bumped hard
again he may be out for the season.
It is believed, however, that both men
will be able to start the game and as
soon as the Cards have scored Van Gent
will take them out. That seems to be
the logical move.
Stanford went north for the Wash
ington game last year about even on the
dope. The game was one of the best
of the season and was won when "Dink"
Templcton dropped one over in the sec
ond quarter. That was all of the scor
ing.

Tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock the
Stanford freshmen meet Lincoln Higli
from Los Angeles on the home turf, in
the last preliminary game before the
clash with the Bruin Babes at Berkeley
next Friday.
Despite a growing hospital list, Coach
Seay will be able to put out a formidable
eleven against the southerners and ex
pects to take an easy scalp. Helser,
Shipke, Dole and Wideman are listed
among the cripples, although Dole and
Shipke will probably be in the play to
morrow.
Last evening the Babes scrimmaged
with the second Varsity and boast of
giving Van Gent's second stringers a
good trimming. Coach Seay started his
first-string lineup and then shifted to
give every man a chance. Kraft, play
ing quarterback for the second varsity,
showed up to good advantage. He is a
fighter and field general of ability. The
skilful way in- which he handled ten
men who did not make even a good
bluff of knowing the signals brought
much favorable comment from the side
lines. Helser, freshman tackle who has
been giving Shipke a hard race for po
sition, was injured severely during the
play. He had been out of play for sev
eral days with wrenched muscles in his
leg, and last night's injury will put him
out for the rest of the season.
Lincoln High made a good showing
in football last season and entered this
season with high hopes of taking south
ern prep-school honors. They have a
number of crack individual players and
attribute their defeat by both Manual
Arts and Los Angeles High elevens as
the result of a slump. They come pre
pared for a battle.
Dennis and Howard will not don the
striped jerseys tomorrow. They are not
in the best of shape and Coach Seay
does not want to risk any additions to
his cripple list. The men will probably
start: Janssen, le: Fuller, re; Shipke,
It; Dole, rt; Neill, lg; Mcrorie, rg; Wil
liams, c ; Wheat, qb; Wittenberg, lh ;
Gilliland, rh; Cuddeback, fb.
Admission to the game wiill be 25
cents or student body cards.
ford must watch. Ray Echman, the
skipper of the Sun Dodgers, has a repu
tation in the northwest as a clever
broken field runner and a master of
football tactics. Glenn Galligan, right
end, is rated as a stellar end. Against
the Oregon Aggies he caught two sen
sational passes and on one occasion had
a clear field in front of him but slipped
and fell in the sawdust field.
As it looks tonight both Stanford and
California should win tomorrow. That
would make the setting perfect for the
Big Game here November 19.

tackle who has been perhaps Stanford's
most consistent man in the line this sea
son. Carter hurt his knee badly in the
Aggie game. The injury is better but
if the big fellow gets it bumped hard
again he may be out for the season.
It is believed, however, that both men
will be able to start the game and as
soon as the Cards have scored Van Gent
will take them out. That seems to be
the logical move.
Stanford went north for the Wash
ington game last year about even on the
dope. The game was one of the best
of the season and was won when "Dink"
Templcton dropped one over in the sec
ond quarter. That was all of the scor
ing.
Washington has two men that Stan-

Tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock the
Stanford freshmen meet Lincoln Higli
from Los Angeles on the home turf, in
the last preliminary game before the
clash with the Bruin Babes at Berkeley
next Friday.
Despite a growing hospital list, Coach
Seay will be able to put out a formidable
eleven against the southerners and ex
pects to take an easy scalp. Helser,
Shipke, Dole and Wideman are listed
among the cripples, although Dole and
Shipke will probably be in the play to
morrow.
Last evening the Babes scrimmaged
with the second Varsity and boast of
giving Van Gent's second stringers a
good trimming. Coach Seay started his
first-string lineup and then shifted to
give every man a chance. Kraft, play
ing quarterback for the second varsity,
showed up to good advantage. He is a
fighter and field general of ability. The
skilful way in- which he handled ten
men who did not make even a good
bluff of knowing the signals brought
much favorable comment from the side
lines. Helser, freshman tackle who has
been giving Shipke a hard race for po
sition, was injured severely during the
play. He had been out of play for sev
eral days with wrenched muscles in his
leg, and last night's injury will put him
out for the rest of the season.
Lincoln High made a good showing
in football last season and entered this
season with high hopes of taking south
ern prep-school honors. They have a
number of crack individual players and
attribute their defeat by both Manual
Arts and Los Angeles High elevens as
the result of a slump. They come pre
pared for a battle.
Dennis and Howard will not don the
striped jerseys tomorrow. They are not
in the best of shape and Coach Seay
does not want to risk any additions to
his cripple list. The men will probably
start: Janssen, le: Fuller, re; Shipke,
It; Dole, rt; Neill, lg; Mcrorie, rg; Wil
liams, c ; Wheat, qb; Wittenberg, lh ;
Gilliland, rh; Cuddeback, fb.
Admission to the game wiill be 25
cents or student body cards.
ford must watch. Ray Echman, the
skipper of the Sun Dodgers, has a repu
tation in the northwest as a clever
broken field runner and a master of
football tactics. Glenn Galligan, right
end, is rated as a stellar end. Against
the Oregon Aggies he caught two sen
sational passes and on one occasion had
a clear field in front of him but slipped
and fell in the sawdust field.
As it looks tonight both Stanford and
California should win tomorrow. That
would make the setting perfect for the
Big Game here November 19.
