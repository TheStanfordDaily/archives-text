THE RAJAH'S PALACE
MYSORE. INDIA
Equipped "with Otis Ele-vatort I
WITHIN the romantic line of "India's coral
strand," in remote, un - thought -of places,
Otis haj introduced modern, vertical transportation.
The Rajah of the native State of Mysore resides in
this palace in the capital city of the same name.
What a strange note this modern elevator must bring
to this palace! . . . The civilization of the West
reaching into the very heart of the Orient and paving
the way for other products!
As an achievement, this Otis installation is note
worthy in itself, but its chief significance lies in the
fact that it is a typical indication of the world-wide
scope of Otis activities.
