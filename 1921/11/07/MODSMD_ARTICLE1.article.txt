# SUN DODGERS HOLD CARDINAL PLAYERS TO SCORELESS TIE
## Washington Line Shows Unexpected Strength; Wilcox Gets A wag for Long Gains; Passes Fail at Goal 
### (By TOM IRWIN, '23 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, NOVEMBER 6.—A slick ball, a wet field, and
a fighting opposition kept Stanford from a win over the University of Wash
ington, here Saturday.
In the last Quarter Stanford made 56 yards from scrimmage as against
7 yards by Washington. A pass thrown by Shlaudeman to Mertz over the
goal line slipped through the latter's fingers. Another pass that Betts caught
over the goal line was not allowed as Betts was declared ineligible. Wash
ington held Stanford for downs three times on the four-yard line.
Here are the statistics of the game:—First downs, Stanford 11, Wash
ington 0; yards gained, 141, Washington 122; completed passes, Stanford
3 of 13 attempts for gains of 46 yards; Washington 2 of 11 for 24 yards;
Stanford intercepted 4 passes for 20 yards, Washington intercepted 2 with
out gains; Stanford punted 13 times for 500 yards, Washington 10 time for 390
yards
Both Stanford and Washington fumbled once and recovered once. Ludeke
and Carter both blocked punts for Stanford in the last quarter but the Cards
were unable to make ground on the one that was recovered.

"A slick ball, a wet field, and a fight
ing opposition kept Stanford from a
win."
That tells the story of how a desper
ate team battled Gene Van Gent's Stan
ford vaisity to a 0-to-0 tie in the Wash
ington Stadium Saturday.
The Sun Dodgers, playing against time
in the last quarter, when the Cardinals
struggled to snatch a victory, got the
breaks of the game and earned a tie
score, when "Shorty" Mertz, standing
over the goal line, dropped a forward
pass from Bob Shlaudeman. The field
was wet and the ball extremely hard to
Jiold, dispatches say.
The Washington team got the breaks
again when "Red" Betts, who had snared
a pass back of the goal line was declared
ineligible for the ball. The Sun Dodgers
were given the oval on their 20-yard
mark and immediately kicked out of dan
ger.
On another occasion Shlaudeman and
Wilcox worked the ball on short runs to
Washington's four-yard line, but Wash
ington held and took the ball on downs.
Stanford fought viciously to win,
Washington just as hard to stave off
defeat, and the breaks of the game went
their way.
Enoch Bagshaw's Sun Dodgers
launched an unexpected offensive in the
first half that once threatened the Cardi
nal goal. Captain Eckmann and Greene,
who was sent into the game at half as
a surprise, fought their way through the
Stanford line and around the ends until
the ball rested within easy scoring dis
tance. But Van Gent's men braced and
held for downs and Captain Patrick
kicked out of danger. That was the
one time that the Sun Dodgers were
dangerous.
Dispatches from Seattle say that Bob
Shlaudeman, the Stanford quarterback,
and Art Wilcox, who was rushed into
the game as soon as the Cards started
their determined offensive, were the stars
of the game.
An analysis of the game, play by play,
proves that Stanford had the better of
it in every department. Van Gent's men
made first downs eleven times to Wash
ington's six. From scrimmage Stanford
made 141 yards as against 122 for the
Sun Dodgers. Stanford completed four
passes for a net gain of 46 yards, while
Washington completed two for a net gain
of 24 yards.
