# The 						Rally Tonight.
## 
### 
The team gets back from Washington tonight at
11 :45. This is later than "was originally expected
and will make some hardship for each member of
the student body in getting to the rally which is
going to be held in front of the Southern Pacific
Depot to welcome home the members of the squad
and coaches who made the northern trip. Right
at this time, however, is the best chance that you
will have to show your loyalty to the men who
went north to represent your University. They are
coming back from a hard-fought game and will
appreciate and need a welcome such as will be pos
sible if all members of the student body turn out
tonight to make the march down town and meet the
team when it comes in. Last Wednesday when the
team left for Seattle confident of a victory accord
to all the dope, it was sent off with the hurrahs
of more than a thousand rooters ringing in its ears.
Now when the team comes back it has a greater
need of your support.
Unless the plans of the rally committee are fol
lowed out absolutely there can not be a perfect suc
cess. The entire student body of the University
must turn out in force to make the show that is
necessary. To do this all the groups on the campus
must co-operate in giving their undivided support.
The only excuse for a man not giving an hour of
his time to welcoming the squad back from the
northern trip is sickness.
The barring of automobiles from the parade
should be accepted in good spirit. If all the ma
chines owned on the campus are taken out for the
march down town they will interfere with the men's
part of the line and will take away some of the
force that is needed in the march.
Songs that will be used for the rally are printed
in this issue of the Daily. They can be cut out and
taken with each person. Campus pianists will visit
the different groups about the University at supper
time and play the tunes. It should be easy to learn
the short songs before leaving for the rally and that
will be the most important part, for it is the hope
of the yell leaders that everyone may have the new
songs well learned in order that they may be sprung
on the team while the rally is on. This is the last
evening rally before the one on the Thursday pre
ceding the liig Game, and tonight will be the greatest
chance we will have as an organized band to get in
and yell for our football team. Each man of the
student body should appoint himself to see that no
one is left by any chance without an urgent request
to make it to the rally if possible.
