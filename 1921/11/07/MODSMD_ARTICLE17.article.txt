# To the Freshmen.

### 
Freshmen meet tonight to decide on the final plans
for the erection of this year's bonfire. This is the
first time that the '25 class has had a chance to show
something for itself in the line of University activity.
The work starts tomorrow. Let every member -of
the Freshman Class acquaint himself tonight with
the duty roster that will be kept so that he may be
on hand at the right time to do his appointed task.
A proper spirit shown at the first day of building the
big heap that will later be burned for the Big Game
will go a long way toward making a good impression
on the minds of members of the student body in
regard to the Frehmen. This year plans are more
complete than usual as far as the obtaining of the
materials for the bonfire is concerned, and it should
be easy for the first-year men to get their schedule
in working order in record time and make the bon
fire one of the best that has ever been raised. Don't
let it be ONE of the best. Strive to make it the
BEST in keeping with the year that promises to be
Stanford's. A willingness to show up at the time
when your name is down for work will make it
easier for the Sophomore committee and for the
Freshman committee in charge.

TOMORROW IS ELECTION DAY for members
of the student body who are registered voters in the
