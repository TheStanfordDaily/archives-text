....If anybody tries to razz Cabbages too much, it may
become exclusive and make itself a real organization—
Eta, Eta, Eta, or Stop Look and Listen would both be
good formal names.

But Cabbages are not Greek. When in America,
speak as the English do.

A new relief for the thirst-ridden has been discovered.
Liquid air is a reality. Carry a flask of this substance
around with you, and the moment demon thirst assails
you, take a swig. Your craving for liquor will be done
away with—and so will you.

For the benefit of mankind in general, we have in
stituted the Kabbage Korrespondence Kourse, or The
Easy Road to Knowledge. It is free to all who can
answer the questions. Line forms down there by the
fifth block, lady.

Our first lesson is in geography. First we shall give
the principles, and later ask questions based on same.
If you don't know anything, here's a chance to be con
sistant.
* * *
Principle one: A stream is always either the same,
or is getting larger or smaller. This may be due to one
of three things: (1) It is remaining the same; (2) It
is getting larger; (3) It is getting smaller.
Ques. One: What's the matter with a stream whan it
isn't either getting larger or remaining the same? Is it
getting smaller? (This is a hint to guide the stupid).
Be sure before you answer.

Principle two: A delta is a deposit of a river at its
junction with the ocean. An alluvial fan is practically
the same thing. A talus slope has nothing to do with
either of them.
*. * *
Question two: If you found a talus slope on top of
an alluvial fan, what woulti your first impression be?
What about the delta? (This is a catch question). Why
don't you think so?

Continued later, when the faculty comes back from a
vacation studying the effects of erosion on a waxed
floor.

We always
wondered why
every body hangs around
below the Quad walk
by the Econ steps,
and takes their
constitutional
blowing smol^e-rings.
Yesterday,
we decided to ask a guy
about it.
As we started,
the 499 th
approached
on the«walk above.
This gent
drew a deep puff.
A wind sprang up.
He exhaled,
and watched
the smoke ascend.
Gimme a cig.

In line with the Call's Screenydills, we have started
something on our own hook. Fill out the missing lines
and words in the following jingles and get a rich re
ward (to be announced later).

Don't try these unless you are mentally awake. No

Now this verse here ain't got any sense.

Don't you think that the scheme is immense?

He sat on a bench freshly painted,
And his pants with bright colors were tainted;
Someone told him, "
And said, " a ,"
He turned white as a sheet and the f nted.

His auto st lied right on the tracks,
So he tried to get off some smart cracks: "
"Don't get scared," he reproved,
"If the t n comes, we'll move."
