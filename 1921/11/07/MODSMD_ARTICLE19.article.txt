Stanford precinct. The question before the voters
is one of particularly vital interest to men students
of the University who are interested in seeing the
abolition of the unpleasantness caused by the exces
sive use of liquor in this locality. Here is a chance
for the men to decide whether the ordinance of the
Santa Clara Supervisors, which will make enforce
ment of the liquor laws possible, will be made
positive. A large vote from the Stanford precinct
will place it squarely on record, and it is the duty of
each member of the student body who has a vote to
get out and cast it according to his convictions at
the polls tomorrow. The polls will be in the Wom
an's Clubhouse, and will be open from 6 a.m. until
7 p. m.

There will be an important meeting of the entire
editorial staff, Tuesday, at 1:15 p.m., in the office of
the Daily Palo A1t0... It is necessary that all staff mem
bers attend and that they be there on time.
