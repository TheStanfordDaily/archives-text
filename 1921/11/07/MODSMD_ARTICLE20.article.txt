Owing to the fact that the retrench
ment measures adopted by Congress
have materially affected the sum avail
able for the upkeep of the military
forces, it is possible that those among
the various R. O. T. C. units in the
colleges of the Western United States
belonging to the field artillery will not
go to Camp Knox, Tenn., for their sum
mer training, as heretofore.
Regional camps may possibly be sub
stituted. Thus, the R. O. T. C. units in
the West may be sent to Camp Lewis,
Washington, or may receive their train
ing at the Presidio at San Francisco.
The change in the location of the
training camps has not yet been officially
made, so far as known, but has been ad
vocated from the standpoint of economy.
Stanford R. O. T. C. students are in
hopes that the change will not be made,
thus giving them a chance to visit in
the eastern portion of the United States
while attending summer camp.
