# Arrangements Completed For Senior Quad Pictures
## 
### 
Arrangements have been completed
for taking the senior Quad pictures.
Beginning immediately, seniors who
have paid their photograph assessments
may report to the Franklin Studios on
the Circle. Seniors are requested to
bring their receipts when visiting the
studio, as only those who have paid their
assessments are eligible.
C. B. Stone, photographer for the
Franklin studios, arranged all details,
and will have on hand a variety of
proofs greater than ever before offered
for class pictures.
