"What's eatin' you?" says Roble
Swimming Poo! to Roble Gymnasium.
"Woodpeckers," says R. G.
"Well, at any rate, you're a holey
sight," comments R. S. P.
"And what's more, I feel perfectly
nutty," adds R. G.
The whole upshot of the above con
versation is the fact that woodpeckers
are making a vigorous attack upon the
tower of Roble gymnasium, and that
its surface is fast taking on the appear
ance of a battle-scarred veteran of the
world war.
Almost the entire surface on the north
and east sides of the tower are peppered
with holes of various sizes, some small
enough to harbor a single acorn, some
large enough to furnish a nesting place
for Mr. and Mrs. W. and the whole
family. It looks very much as though
the gymnasium was just recovering from
a violent attack of small-pox.
No measures have as yet been taken
to check the barrage, but it is fast be
coming evident that unless something
is done, it will be necessary to fortify
the roof with sand-bags or other means
of protection to prevent the entire build
ing from being pecked to pieces.
"Cheese it," say we to the enemy.
"We're doing our worst," says the
woodpecker, continuing his onslaught.
