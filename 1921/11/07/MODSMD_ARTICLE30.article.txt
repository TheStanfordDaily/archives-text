## Too Much Experience Among San Francisco Club Squad Spells Defeat of Local Team 
### 
Too many experienced stars spelled
the defeat of Coach Brandsten's varsi
ty swimming team, in its meet with
the Olympic Club, in San Francisco,
Friday night, and the clubmen came
out on the long end of a 40 to 27
score.
The Cardinal mermen showed un
expected strength and pushed the
Olympic men to the limit to win.
Snedder of Stanford, scored the only
first place for his team, when he won
the diving event, with White of the
Cardinal second.
A. Austin put up a great fight
against Lester Smith, the young
Olympic Club sprint phenomenon, in
the 100-yards free style. For three
quarters of the race the pair were
neck and neck, but a final spurt put
Smith a scant yard ahead at the
finish. Smith negotiated the distance
in the exceptional time of 57 1-5 sec
onds.
Fletcher swam right behind Jack
Howell, Olympic Games man, in the
100-yard breast stroke, and the Olym
pian had only two feet to spare when
he crossed the line. Fletcher also
came in second in the 100-yard back
stroke, George Schroth of the Olym
pics winning the event.
The Cardinal relay team gave the
clubmen, who figured an easy win in
first event, a hard fight. For five laps
the Stanford swimmers were either in
the lead or even with their opponents,
bu Smith forged ahead in the last lap
and gave first honors to the Olympics.
The Olympic Club's senior water
polo team, containing several national
stars, scored an eight to one win
