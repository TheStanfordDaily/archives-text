# LINCOLN LOSES TO FRESHMAN TEAM IN RAGGED GAME
## Infants' Fumbles Hold Score 21-14; Prep Coach Gives Many Subs Chance on Field 
### C. H. Prior, '23 
Presenting a spectacle of over-confi
dence, fumbling, and general ragged play
ing, the Freshman gridmen finally man
aged to wrest a 21-to-14 victory from
Lincoln High on the local turf Satur
day morning.
Gilliland and Cuddeback should have
starred, but it can hardly be said tliat
they carried off first honors, as they
both fumbled consistently, and Cudde
back's wonder boot did not seem to be
in the game. Shipke, the steady, hard
playing left tackle, and Wittenberg, at
left half, deserve the most praise, if
there is any praise to be handed out after
such an exhibit. Dyer and Thompson
stood out as the best men on the prep
squad.
Lincoln High brought along every
man in the school who was big enough
to fill out a suit. They followed up this
idea by running in substitutes so fast
during the entire game that it would have
taken twenty assistants to keep track of
the changes.
A fumble in the first few minutes of
play gave Lincoln the ball on the Babes'
twenty-yard line, and Dyer, the fighting
halfback of the southerners, pushed it
across for a touchdown in three suc
cessive gains. The goal was kicked.
Before the first quarter ended, the
Freslimen started an offensive from the
Lincoln thirty-six-yard line and carried it
consistently down the field. Wittenberg
started it off with a twenty-five yard run,
and the rest of the backfield took turns
at making good gains. When almost to
the goal line Guilliland's fumble threat
ened to upset things, but he recovered it.
Shipke carried across the line and Cud
deback kicked the goal.
In the second quarter the Babes started
a drive from Thompson's punt to their
own thirty-three-yard line, Wittenberg
taking it for five yards and Dole getting
away for fourteen more. Wheat com
pleted a pass to Fuller for sixteen yards
more, putting the ball on the Lincoln
thirty-two-yard line. Gilliland fumbled
and Dyer ran it back to the Freshman
thirty-yard line. Then a clever pass by
Thompson to Boles and the Lincoln squad
had its second touchdown. Smutz kicked
goal.
To start off the second half, Wheat
tried three straight passes, and they all
fell incomplete. With the ball on the
Freshman thirty-nine-yard line, Gilliland
picked his way through for a twenty
four-yard gain. Wheat tried two more
unsuccessful forward passes, and Ship
ke saved the ball to the Babes by making
a good gain. Wittenberg and Gilliland
advanced it to the two-yard line, and Dole
carried it over. Cuddeback kicked the
goal.
From this point on the Freshmen stif
fened and played a better game. They
moved consistently down the field for the
next touchdown, piercing the visitors'
line at every play. Wheat completed two
forward passes to Gilliland, and both
tackles came around for gains. Gilliland
carried over and Cuddeback kicked the
goal.
With the Babes steadily advancing into
his territory, Dyer intercepted Wheat's
pass and ran it back thirty-five yards to
the Freshman forty-yard line. His coun
ter attack did not stop there. He gained
five yards, and three yards, and then
four more, in succession. Thompson
passed twice to McCue for fifteen yards,
and this brought the ball to the ten-yard
line. Dyer smashed through for five
more.
At this point the freshmen redeemed
themselves, and the stone wall of strength
which held the charging southerners was
no kin to the ragged playing squad of
the first half. Gilliland was at the bot
tom of every play, and his backing up
the line was largely responsible for the
Lincoln failure to score.

goal.
From this point on the Freshmen stif
fened and played a better game. They
moved consistently down the field for the
next touchdown, piercing the visitors'
line at every play. Wheat completed two
forward passes to Gilliland, and both
tackles came around for gains. Gilliland
carried over and Cuddeback kicked the
goal.
With the Babes steadily advancing into
his territory, Dyer intercepted Wheat's
pass and ran it back thirty-five yards to
the Freshman forty-yard line. His coun
ter attack did not stop there. He gained
five yards, and three yards, and then
four more, in succession. Thompson
passed twice to McCue for fifteen yards,
and this brought the ball to the ten-yard
line. Dyer smashed through for five
more.
At this point the freshmen redeemed
themselves, and the stone wall of strength
which held the charging southerners was
no kin to the ragged playing squad of
the first half. Gilliland was at the bot
tom of every play, and his backing up
the line was largely responsible for the
Lincoln failure to score.

Presenting a spectacle of over-confi
dence, fumbling, and general ragged play
ing, the Freshman gridmen finally man
aged to wrest a 21-to-14 victory from
Lincoln High on the local turf Satur
day morning.
Gilliland and Cuddeback should have
starred, but it can hardly be said tliat
they carried off first honors, as they
both fumbled consistently, and Cudde
back's wonder boot did not seem to be
in the game. Shipke, the steady, hard
playing left tackle, and Wittenberg, at
left half, deserve the most praise, if
there is any praise to be handed out after
such an exhibit. Dyer and Thompson
stood out as the best men on the prep
squad.
Lincoln High brought along every
man in the school who was big enough
to fill out a suit. They followed up this
idea by running in substitutes so fast
during the entire game that it would have
taken twenty assistants to keep track of
the changes.
A fumble in the first few minutes of
play gave Lincoln the ball on the Babes'
twenty-yard line, and Dyer, the fighting
halfback of the southerners, pushed it
across for a touchdown in three suc
cessive gains. The goal was kicked.
Before the first quarter ended, the
Freslimen started an offensive from the
Lincoln thirty-six-yard line and carried it
consistently down the field. Wittenberg
started it off with a twenty-five yard run,
and the rest of the backfield took turns
at making good gains. When almost to
the goal line Guilliland's fumble threat
ened to upset things, but he recovered it.
Shipke carried across the line and Cud
deback kicked the goal.
In the second quarter the Babes started
a drive from Thompson's punt to their
own thirty-three-yard line, Wittenberg
taking it for five yards and Dole getting
away for fourteen more. Wheat com
pleted a pass to Fuller for sixteen yards
more, putting the ball on the Lincoln
thirty-two-yard line. Gilliland fumbled
and Dyer ran it back to the Freshman
thirty-yard line. Then a clever pass by
Thompson to Boles and the Lincoln squad
had its second touchdown. Smutz kicked
goal.
To start off the second half, Wheat
tried three straight passes, and they all
fell incomplete. With the ball on the
Freshman thirty-nine-yard line, Gilliland
picked his way through for a twenty
four-yard gain. Wheat tried two more
unsuccessful forward passes, and Ship
ke saved the ball to the Babes by making
a good gain. Wittenberg and Gilliland
advanced it to the two-yard line, and Dole
carried it over. Cuddeback kicked the
goal.
