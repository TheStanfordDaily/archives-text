# SOCCER TEAM WINS FROM CLUBMEN, 1-0
## Stanford Team Goes Into Lead In Soccer League by Means of Victory Over Olympics 
### 
Stanford now leads the University and
Club Soccer League by virtue of the
1-0 defeat that the varsity administered
to the Olympic Club eleven in Saturday's
game. This is the first defeat that the
Winged O men have sustained this sea
son.
Fur flew from the time Stanford kicked
off until the final whistle. In the first
half the Card forwards rushed the Olym
pics off their feet, and the red-shirted
backfield men were giving their forwards
the advantage by long, clean, accurate
boots which allowed the line men to pur
sue the offensive. Several times the club
men rallied and tried to pierce the strong
Stanford defense. Occasionally a shot
did break through the backs, but Masters
never let one go by. Toward the close
of the half an Olympic Club man
fouled and Stanford received a penalty
kick. Peavy made this good, and thus
scored the only point of the game.
In the second period Coach Maloney's
men, for the first time this season, had
to resort to defensive play. Olympic line
men rushed the Cardinal goal consistent
ly. On these occasions the city eleven
generally found a mass of Stanford play
ers in front of the goal, making it im
possible for them to score.
Captain Gorman and Peavy were the
Cardinal stars of the game. Both of
these men played consistently and were
instrumental in breaking up the Olympic
line formations. Peavy scored the only
point of the game. Mendonca and Mas
ters, playing full and goal, were effective
in keeping the Olympics from scoring.
