# BEAUTY PINS CAUSE THRILL IN CHAPPIE SHOW MUSICAL ACT
## 
### 
Two old-fashioned diamond beauty pins
form the basis for one of the ingenious
plots to be used in the Chappie Football
Show ou the nineteenth of this month.
The theme of "The Blue Envelope,"
written by Tom Carskadon, is woven
around the fate of these two family heir
looms.
Of course, the pins are lost, and the
story revolves about the frantic efforts of
half a dozen people to recover these price
less possessions. The owner of the pins
happens to be a dainty, demure little miss,
and she happens to have a beau, of
course, that makes the situation all the
more complicated. The young man sets
out to find the pins, and the search car
ries him rapidly through a number of
very amusing situations, replete with
laughs and thrills.
The little miss loses her temper, and
the man loses his girl, while the diamond
pins laugh in fiendish glee over all the
trouble they have caused. But even dia
mond pins can't stay hidden forever, and
they come to light in a most astonishing
manner.
Donaldine Cameron plays the role of
the lovely little possessor of the diamond
pins, while Chet Hess is the impassioned
youth who pours the wonderful things
into his sweetheart's ears. Besides this
young New York clubman and his fian
cee there is a neglected wife; a second
hand rose; a military figure; and as
usual, a couple of regular dumb-bells.
