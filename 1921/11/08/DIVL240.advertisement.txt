<S> Rooters' hats, designed for the <$>
<$> Big Game stunts in the Sta- <S>
<*> dium, were placed on sale to- <§>
<i> day at Wideman's in Palo Alto. <s>
<?> Every person who sits in the <$>
<«> Stanford rooting section will be <$>
<?> required to have a new style <8>
<$> hat, as the hats of former years <$>
<$> can not be used for the stunts <$>
<S> which have been worked out by <$>
<$ Yell Leader Connolly and the <§>
<$> Rally Committee. This year's <$>
<$> hats are red and white and can <*>
<$> be reversed. <$>
<$> The hats sell for $1.00, and <S>
<S> what profit is derived from <$>
<§> their sale will go toward financ- <S>
<$> ing the bleacher stunts at the <$>
<?> Big Gamee.
