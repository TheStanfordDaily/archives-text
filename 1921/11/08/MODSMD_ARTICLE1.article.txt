# GAY WHITE WAY PLOT FEATURED IN FOOTBALL SHOW
## Troubles of Stage Directors Aptly Portrayed in Sketch, 'Somewhere on Broadway' 
### 
"Somewhere On Broadway" is the
title of one of the big numbers in this
year's Hammer and Coffin Football
Show. The cast has been definitely
selected, and rehearsals are well un
der way.
This little sketch was written by one
of the Chappies, and contains all the
spontaneous wit and humor that has
contributed so long to the success of the
the Chaparral. It is a tale of life on
Broadway in Little Old New York when
one of the comic opera "hits" of the
season is just taking form. The par
ticipants are for the most part a group
of down-and-out disciples of Shakespeare
and they act accordingly. The director
is of a more modern turn of mind and
the fun begins when he tries to remodel
these ancient antiques into more peppy
material.
The opening scene for the comic opera,
of which this is the dress rehearsal, is
laid at the castle of the Princess Guarus
tark in the Old World kingdom of Vul
garia. There is a moat and a draw
bridge with the stone walls of the
mighty palace rising up in canvas be
hind. The scene painters have just com
pleted their tedious job, and a large and
grotesque painted sign hangs from the
battlements, bearing that old familiar
inscription, "Fresh Paint."
Downstage stands the proverbial di
rector, tearing his hair in a frenzy of
grief, gesticulating wildly, and shouting
directions that nobody can hear. Off to
one side, the beauty chorus is clustered
together, tittering and tee-heeing among
themselves at the futility and uselessness
of it all. In comes the American hero
on a dashing white cliarger and flings
himself off beneath the window if the
fairy princess. The window opens just
to the right of the "Fresh Paint" sign
and the girl appears in robes of a thou
sand years ago, and kneels on the bal
cony. The hero begins his would-be
famous love song and the heroine ex
tends her slim white arms and leans
from the box. It is a dramatic moment.
But, unfortunately, Adolph, the unro
mantic stagehand, in the performance of
his duty, passes between the lover and
the loved one with a part of a drawing
room set to be used in the next act.
The spell is broken—the director moans
and faints away—and Adolph trips
blithely in, unconscious of the havoc that
lie has wrought.
The princess, affrighted, draws back,
and the weakened cardboard balcony,
unable to stand the strain imposed upon
it longer, gives way and precipitates the
fairy princess into the willing arms of
the American hero. The burden is too
much, and together the couple sprawl
over half the tiny kingdom of Vulgaria.
All this, and more, marks the action of
the comic opera dress rehearsal, some
where on the great white way.
Fred Hughes plays the part of the
American hero, while Geraldine Watt is
the winning Princess Guarustark. The
countess is excellently portrayed by
Elizabeth Noyes, and John Sansone is
the villainous count. Paul Claflin fur
nishes his share of the mirth as the
blundering stagehand. Sam Mendenhall
is the servant and man of affairs in Vul
garia. The celebrated Chappie beauty
chorus will also be there to add tone to
the act.

where on the great white way.
Fred Hughes plays the part of the
American hero, while Geraldine Watt is
the winning Princess Guarustark. The
countess is excellently portrayed by
Elizabeth Noyes, and John Sansone is
the villainous count. Paul Claflin fur
nishes his share of the mirth as the
blundering stagehand. Sam Mendenhall
is the servant and man of affairs in Vul
garia. The celebrated Chappie beauty
chorus will also be there to add tone to
the act.
"Somewhere On Broadway" is the
title of one of the big numbers in this
year's Hammer and Coffin Football
Show. The cast has been definitely
selected, and rehearsals are well un
der way.
This little sketch was written by one
of the Chappies, and contains all the
spontaneous wit and humor that has
contributed so long to the success of the
the Chaparral. It is a tale of life on
Broadway in Little Old New York when
one of the comic opera "hits" of the
season is just taking form. The par
ticipants are for the most part a group
of down-and-out disciples of Shakespeare
and they act accordingly. The director
is of a more modern turn of mind and
the fun begins when he tries to remodel
these ancient antiques into more peppy
material.
The opening scene for the comic opera,
of which this is the dress rehearsal, is
laid at the castle of the Princess Guarus
tark in the Old World kingdom of Vul
garia. There is a moat and a draw
bridge with the stone walls of the
mighty palace rising up in canvas be
hind. The scene painters have just com
pleted their tedious job, and a large and
grotesque painted sign hangs from the
battlements, bearing that old familiar
inscription, "Fresh Paint."
Downstage stands the proverbial di
rector, tearing his hair in a frenzy of
grief, gesticulating wildly, and shouting
directions that nobody can hear. Off to
one side, the beauty chorus is clustered
together, tittering and tee-heeing among
themselves at the futility and uselessness
of it all. In comes the American hero
on a dashing white cliarger and flings
himself off beneath the window if the
fairy princess. The window opens just
to the right of the "Fresh Paint" sign
and the girl appears in robes of a thou
sand years ago, and kneels on the bal
cony. The hero begins his would-be
famous love song and the heroine ex
tends her slim white arms and leans
from the box. It is a dramatic moment.
But, unfortunately, Adolph, the unro
mantic stagehand, in the performance of
his duty, passes between the lover and
the loved one with a part of a drawing
room set to be used in the next act.
The spell is broken—the director moans
and faints away—and Adolph trips
blithely in, unconscious of the havoc that
lie has wrought.
The princess, affrighted, draws back,
and the weakened cardboard balcony,
unable to stand the strain imposed upon
it longer, gives way and precipitates the
fairy princess into the willing arms of
the American hero. The burden is too
much, and together the couple sprawl
over half the tiny kingdom of Vulgaria.
All this, and more, marks the action of
the comic opera dress rehearsal, some
where on the great white way.
