# RETURN OF TEAM CALLS OUT CAMPUS
## 
### 
Over fifteen hundred Cardinal support
ers greeted the Stanford varsity on its
return from Seattle at 11 o'clock last
night. The band started from the Phi
Gamma Delta house at 10 o'clock, and
by the time it had arrived at the English
corner, 600 shouting rooters were march
ing to its music. About 1000 men from
Encina, Sequoia, and other living groups
of the campus joined.
As this shouting and singing crowd
marched down Palm Drive toward Palo
Alto, red flares were ignited about every
400 feet to show that the crowd was on
its way. Tin cans, sirens, dish pans,
horns, guns, and all other conceivable
noise-producing articles were in use by
the marchers.
The parade went up University Ave
nue to Bryant street, then around the
block and down University avenue to the
S. P. depot, where songs and yells were
given for about ten minutes previous to
the arrival of the train bringing the Car
dinal warriors back from the north. As
the train pulled into the station, a huge
"sky-rocket" greeted the Varsity. Nu
merous other yells and songs were given
before the rally broke up and the rooters
started back for the campus.
The formation of the parade was un
der the direction of the Circle "S" So
ciety, which lined the men up eight
abreast on their journey from the cam
pus. Palo Alto turned out to watch the
Cardinal supporters and joined in the
noise-making at the depot.
The details of the rally were worked
up by the Rally Committee, Yell Leaders
and Dan Evans, student body president.
Those in charge expressed themselves as
highly pleased with the turn-out.
Groups assembled at Encina, Sequoia,
and the Union to practice the new songs
previous to the rally, and many men
went away from these meetings with a
complete knowledge of all the new and
old songs.
