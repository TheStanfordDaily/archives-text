# HUNDRED-YARD DASH RUN YESTERDAY IN INTRAMURAL TRACK
## 
### 
Lindsay Howard, '25, running for
Delta Kappa Epsilon in the preliminary
heats of the intramural 100-yard dash
held on the track field last night, made
the fastest time of 10:3. R. S. Nourse
of Sequoia had the next best time of
10:4. There were nine men who
reached the century mark in 11 flat.
The runners making 11 flat time are:
Hamlyn, and Carver, Sigma Alpha Ep
silon; Brooke, and Wright, Theta Chi;
Bulliard, Breakers; Colin, Encina; Tal
bert, Sigma Chi; Hale, Sigma Nu;
Hays, Phi Delta Theta. Two final heats
from these nine men and the two men
who did better than 11 flat will be run
off on next Tuesday, before the intra
mural relay contest.
Over 60 participated in the competi
tion, and a good-sized crowd showed
plenty of enthusiasm in urging on the
runners. Most of the men were not in
condition to make their best time. One
of the objects of intramural track is to
interest students in starting early train
ing and this was evidently accom
plished last night. Several members of
the varsity and freshmen squads of last
year who are ineligible furnished some
fast time in the competition.
Tomorrow from 2 until 5 the running
broad jump will be the third event in
the intramural contests.
