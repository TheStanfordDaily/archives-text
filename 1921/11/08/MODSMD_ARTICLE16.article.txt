# FRANCIS W. HIRST LECTURES ON LLOYD GEORGE AS PREMIER
## 
### 
"General opinion holds today that
England would not have entered the
war had the British Givernment made
known the facts of secret treaties of
1914," said Francis W. Hirst, Monday
afternoon at the Little Theatre, in his
lecture on "Lloyd George as Prime Min
ister." Lloyd George, in his appeal for
English support after the war, presented
a program of hanging the Kaiser after
a fair trial in England, making Germany
pay the entire costs of the war, excluding
the expenditures of the United States,
and transforming England into an in
dustrial paradise. These proposals ne
cessitated the immediate drawing up of
a treaty with the Dutch, to insure their
refusal to surrender the Kaiser, Profes
sor Hirst continued, "for if the trial had
taken place, Russian and German docu
ments of secret conversations would have
revealed much guilt in other countries
tjian Germany."
Admirers of Lloyd George claim that
he won the war, while others are of the
opinion it was won at a game of check
ers, in which Lord Milner or Marshal
Foch participated. Other critics, the
speaker continued, believe that Germany
was exhausted and encouraged to revolt
by President Wilson's fourteen points,
that the war was prolonged by disagree
ments over the Lansdowne proposals and
the knockout blow. "Regardless of who
won the war," he added, "it is certain
who won the election,'and may win it
again, though he is not so popular today
as in December, 1919."
At the last election, the worst parlia
ment since 1832 was chosen, Professor
Hirst said, though Lloyd George re
mained in office with the same coalition
cabinet. It was suggested that tilings
move more smoothly for the Liberal
party when the leader of the opposite
party has a bad record, and that Lord
Asquith's speeches are always a trump
card. "One can quote anything he wants
to from Asquith's speeches,'
