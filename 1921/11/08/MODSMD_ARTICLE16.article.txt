# FRANCIS W. HIRST LECTURES ON LLOYD GEORGE AS PREMIER
## 
### 
"General opinion holds today that
England would not have entered the
war had the British Givernment made
known the facts of secret treaties of
1914," said Francis W. Hirst, Monday
afternoon at the Little Theatre, in his
lecture on "Lloyd George as Prime Min
ister." Lloyd George, in his appeal for
English support after the war, presented
a program of hanging the Kaiser after
a fair trial in England, making Germany
pay the entire costs of the war, excluding
the expenditures of the United States,
and transforming England into an in
dustrial paradise. These proposals ne
cessitated the immediate drawing up of
a treaty with the Dutch, to insure their
refusal to surrender the Kaiser, Profes
sor Hirst continued, "for if the trial had
taken place, Russian and German docu
ments of secret conversations would have
revealed much guilt in other countries
tjian Germany."
Admirers of Lloyd George claim that
he won the war, while others are of the
opinion it was won at a game of check
ers, in which Lord Milner or Marshal
Foch participated. Other critics, the
speaker continued, believe that Germany
was exhausted and encouraged to revolt
