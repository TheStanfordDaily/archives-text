# Really a Rally.
## 
### 
The Varsity is home! No doubt could he left in
the minds of any one within a three- or four-mile
radius of Palo Alto after the rally last night. If
there is a possibility such as is often urged that
noise raises the dead, the departed alumni are
smiling with the knowledge that the old fight is still
here and is not being kept in the dark.
When the team stepped off the train last night a
roar of welcome hit it that has been accorded to
few organizations of any kind. For intensity and
undivided effort to produce noise it has been rivaled
only by the Halifax explosion. In spite of the late
hour more students turned out to make the march
down town than customarily find time to go to a
rally held in the afternoon. The band gets the
most commendation. They turned out almost 100
per cent and gathered the marchers with their play
ing 011 the streets of the campus and then led the
joyful procession down Palm Drive. Their coming
out won the appreciation of all the student body and
merits thanks from all.
mrsday will be the last bleacher rally before the
riame. The band will be there and will have
lusic for all the new songs that have been dis
..i..w.,ed. The music for some of them is now in
the hands of at least one man in each campus group.
Everyone has a duty to learn these songs so that
Thursday afternoon they can be put over in shape
that will insure their success if used in the game 011
November 19.
