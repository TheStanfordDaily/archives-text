# Honor System Among Thieves.
## 
### 
Reports are coming in of thefts about the campus.
Some of these are not minor borrowings and then
a forgetfulness to return the articles in question. In
the gymnasium the most serious of the stealings have
taken place. Money, watches, and sundry other
articles have been taken from the lockers and the
dressing rooms. The work does not look like that
of an amateur. Under the honor system it is the
duty of each student body member to look after the
affairs of every other one in matters concerning
personal safety of effects. If suspicious characters
of any kind are seen they shouldn't be passed up
without an investigation. It may cost a few min
utes of time to the one making the investigation and
may be the means of saving many dollars to some
other member of the University body. This duty is
incumbent upon each of us, and needs attention at
present.
