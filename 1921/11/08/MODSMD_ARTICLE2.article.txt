# CARDINAL YEARLINGS ARE WORKING HARD IN FINAL PRACTICES
## 
### 
Next Friday afternoon, on the
Berkeley turf, the Stanford and Cali
fornia freshmen face each other in the
Little Big Game of the season. These
two yearling squads have kept Old
Man Dope swinging on a pendulum
since the beginning of the season and,
with the crucial afternoon only four
days away, the favorites have not been
picked.
As is common with freshman teams,
the Stanford Babes have alternated
from slumps to flashes of brilliant
playing. With several of the best
players who have been found in year
ling material for years, this year's
squad has won a good deal of praise
from local fans, and the hopes have
been high that here was a squad who
would bring home the bacon from the
Bruins.
Last evening Coach Seay ran his
men through some signal practice and
then sent the second squad against
the first-stringers in a short scrim
mage. Throughout the contest, the
playing was ragged and there was
a good deal of fumbling. Captain Den
nis stood out as the best open-field
runner in the play. He uses his head
at all times and is able to follow his
interference, picking his way here and
there and taking advantage of every
opportunity.
Cuddeback and Gilliland are bul
warks of strength to the squad and
l\ave been playing with the consist
ency and fight which make for vic
tories. Last Saturday, against the
Lincoln High School, these two men
were both in a slump. They played
with a certain dogged fighting spirit
but everything seemed to go wrong.
Wheat, playing at half during the
early season and in the last few
games working at quarter, is a steady
player with a grim, low-charging
method of attack which makes him a
consistent yard-gainer. Shipke, at left
tackle, has proven his ability to make
holes ahead of the plays and to also
carry the ball for long gains. Howard
is a reliable half-back who will be
likely to work part of the game against
the Bruin Babes.
Coach Seay has declared his inten
tion of putting his proteges through
hard practice this week, for they have
had no hard battles recently and are
not in any danger of going stale from
overwork. With the return of the
varsity from the north, there will un
doubtedly be a scrimmage between
them and the Babes one afternoon this
week.
