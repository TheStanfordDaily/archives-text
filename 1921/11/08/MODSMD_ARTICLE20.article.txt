Often you hear one student ask another, "Where
do you find the books for this courseâ€”in the Li-
Sometimes the reply is, "I don't know. I
t !>een in the Library this quarter." "Neither
says the first student. "I've only been in
there once since the place was built."
Conversations like the above are not unusual.
There are many students whose knowledge of the
Library is confined to its location. They know that
it is situated on the east side of the quadrangle and
that it contains books, for libraries usually do, but
there knowledge of it ends.
Stanford students have access to several thou
sand books, the current magazines, and the daily
newspapers. Yet those who do go to the library go
merely because one of their courses requires it.
After reading the required text they get out and
rarely return until they are again forced by necessity
to do so.
History tells how Lincoln in his boyhood walked
several miles to borrow a book, and when it was de
faced while in his possession he split rails to pay
for it. Yet we of Stanford, within easy access of
the writings of most of the noted literary men of all
ages, rarely bother to cross the street to become ac
quaimed with their works.
Everyone has read editorials that told what books
the ordinary educated American should read. Most

frequently we see Homer, Shakespeare, and Dante
quoted as men with whom everybody should be ac
quainted through their writings. Often we promise
ourselves that we will read them some day. But
there our resolutions end. We realize we should in
crease our knowledge of literature, but somehow we
never seem to get to it.
Students in a university have a privilege that most
people do not enjoy. Cataloguing in university li
braries is usually so much more complete and thor
ough that in a minute it is possible to have any
desired book before us. We are within a short dis
tance of the Library, and many of us are required to
spend part of our time there, not to read what we
would like, but always to read what we are told.
It is to the advantage of every registered student
to become acquainted with the books at hand. Often
it is possible to obtain permission to wander through
the stacks. If you have ever pored over the old
books in the attic at home on a rainy day you will
realize the quiet pleasure that can be secured by such
an afternoon among the books of the Stanford
Library.
