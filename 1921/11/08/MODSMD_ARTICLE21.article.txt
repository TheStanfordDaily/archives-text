Today the patch is in the hands of the poets. Contri
butions have come in droves and sunshine brightens all.
The first selection has been compiled with great care.
If the reader is unable to classify himself on this scale,
the artist has announced himself as only too glad to
oblige with a line of two extra to send home to mother.

The Passing Show
With hair uncut and baggy knees,
Who is this uncouth man one sees?
It is the prof whose personal pride,
For thoughts and books was cast aside.
1925
With gaping mouth and great long neck,
Ye Gods! What is that awful wreck?
A cocky frosh whose gurgling "blub,"
Will soon be heard in porcelain tub.
Hooray!
With eagle-eye, whose brain doth think,
'Oh, for a frosh without a dink!'
This watchful lad sees fun in store,
For he's a hard-boiled sophomore.
( )
A world-wise look, a far'way stare,
With corded pants and polished hair;
See how he snakes and crawls about,
Since one more year will find him out.
Ho, Hum!
But who's this gent with 'dignant air,
Who from Quad corners stands to stare
At bashful maid who passes by?
A noble seniors—that's the guy!
Bands off
His mein so bored, his clothes so old —
He smiled as a Durham he rolled,
"I'm no collegian I aver.
I am a olase holdover."
Look Out!
Is this a human that I see,
Whose socks give out below the knee?
My eyes said "No," 'til reason stirred —
"Yes, she's a co-ed, not a bird "
* * *
Thursday ought to feel pretty weak after that. There's
a bigger charge in the second barrel. The moral is that
all compositors are not necessarily composers.
* * *
ROOT-te-TOOT
Second-hand pens,
Second-hand pads,
That's why they call me Classified Ads.
Peoples' jokes about me can't get too gay—
See what happened on poor Wash's Birthday!
Second-hand Fords,
Second-hand cords,
I never peddle anything that's new.
I own lots of thoughts but I have nary a head;
What ought to be a body is a column instead.
So that's why everyone's wise,
I run those second-hand guys,
On page four, column two.
MOZART.

And in the next cage—the Limerick! More useful
than the safety-pin, easier twisted than the hair-pin,
sweeter sounding than the—what's that, lady?.. Ten
o'clock on the library steps.

BEHOLD!
There was a young fellow named Take,
Who fielded with never a break.
But one day a fly
Caught him square in the eye.
Said the fans, "Ow! What a mis-Take."
There was a poor teamster —O'Tool,
Who decided to chastise a mule.
But he chose the wrong end,
And as you may depend.
It went pretty hard with the fool.

We get it from inside dope that the real purpose of
those new red and white rooter's hats is to dazzle the
Cal varsity with a bewildering shift of color combina
tions. They'll see red and then see white, just when
they thought they were seeing red, which they will be
again as soon as think they're seeing white.

I run those second-hand guys,
On page four, column two.

Caught him square in the eye.

The Passing Show
With hair uncut and baggy knees,
Who is this uncouth man one sees?
It is the prof whose personal pride,
For thoughts and books was cast aside.
1925
With gaping mouth and great long neck,
Ye Gods! What is that awful wreck?
A cocky frosh whose gurgling "blub,"
Will soon be heard in porcelain tub.
Hooray!
With eagle-eye, whose brain doth think,
'Oh, for a frosh without a dink!'
This watchful lad sees fun in store,
For he's a hard-boiled sophomore.
( )
A world-wise look, a far'way stare,
With corded pants and polished hair;
See how he snakes and crawls about,
Since one more year will find him out.
Ho, Hum!
But who's this gent with 'dignant air,
Who from Quad corners stands to stare
At bashful maid who passes by?
A noble seniors—that's the guy!
Bands off
His mein so bored, his clothes so old —
He smiled as a Durham he rolled,
"I'm no collegian I aver.
I am a olase holdover."
Look Out!
