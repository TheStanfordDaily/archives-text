## 
### 
Musical composers are in demand.
Richard Blood, '21, has written a lyric
which may be used as a "Big Game"
song, if some of the campus members
with musical talent will compose a good
tune. The lyric contains plenty of op
portunity for a combination of march
time and funeral endings. Since the
California-Stanford contest is only a few
days off, compositions will have to be
turned in soon. The words are:
Verse:
Down on the Farm there's a great big
hole
Known ev'rywhere as the Stanford
Bow!.
We dug it there for California's Bear.
It's his grave; it's his grave; it's his
grave.
Chorus:
We're out to bury an Oski Bear.
We're out to bury California's Bear.
We have his grave all dug;
Flowers at its side.
We'll make a nice big rug
Out of his hide.
When Oski Bruin meets his ruin
On that fateful day,
We won't have to carry him
Where we want to bury him.
We'll just let him stay
In his grave, in his grave, in his grave.
