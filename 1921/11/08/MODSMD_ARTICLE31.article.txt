# CARD VARSITY TO SWIM NEPTUNE CLUB TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's swimming team will go to
[San Francisco tonight to match its
I strength with the Neptune Club of Ala
meda in the neutral territory of the
! Olympic Club pool.
Last Friday evening, the Cardinal mer
j men put in a successful evening at the
[ Post Street pool, and although they came
Off second best with the more experienced
Olympic Club swimmers, tliey showed
] that Stanford has the makings of a fast,
j well-balanced team.
Tonight the Cardinal squad is going up
! against less severe competition, and they
should come out on top. A. Austin won
the right to be regarded as- one of the
I fastest 100-yard men on the Coast, and
| it is going to be hard to keep him from
| crossing the finish line ahead. Greppin is
■ coming on fast in the 220 and with a little
I more practice he should rank with the
; best of them in his event. Fletcher had
j hard luck in the Olympic meet and was
j forced to be content with two. second
| places, but indications are that he will
come off with a pair of firsts tonight.
The presence of Pinkston, world's cham
pion diver, rather overshadows Shedden
and White, the other Cardinal represen
tatives, but these men can dive on their
own accounts.
Brandsten will swim practically
the same men who started against the
clubmen last week. Water polo will hold
the boards after the swimming meet.
The Stanford water polo team is
hard at work preparing for the national
junior water polo championships which
will take place at San Francisco begin
ning November 16. The Olympic Juni
ors, Sutro Aquatics, and the Neptunes
are the teams the Cardinal seven will
have to beat to win the title.
Play in the interclass water polo tour
nament will start this Wednesday after
noon when the Seniors will meet the
Freshmen. On Thursday the junior and
sophomore sevens will line up. The win
ner of the tourney will be decided on
November 15 or 16.
