# VARSITY IS BACK HOME FROMHARD GAME IN NORTH
## Sun Dodgers Praised. But Van Gent's Men Believe Breaks Went Wrong Way at Seattle 
### 
Interesting sidelights on the game at
Seattle Saturday, when the University of
Washington held Stanford to a 0-to-0
tie, have been given by members of the
varsity who returned here last night.
In the first place the players have no
alibis to offer and only praise for Enoch
Bagshaw's Sun Dodgers, who showed
unexpected strength. The long journey
to the north was a handicap to the
varsity squad, and a wet field and a wet
ball prevented the Cards from winning
in the last half, when Van Gent's men
got under way.
The players say that when "Shorty"
Mertz dropped the forward pass from
Shlaudeman over the goal line, the ball
was so wet that it bounced from his
hands like a bar of soap. He made an
other grab for it just as the ball hit the
ground, but it slipped through his fingers
again.
"Red"' Betts, Stanford guard, caught
a pass on the Washington one-yard line
and carried the ball over the line, but
Referee Varnell declared he was in
eligible to receive the pass and the touch
down was not allowed.
Art Wilcox did not get into the game
until the latter part of the afternoon,
but he was in long enough to start the
Cardinal drive that threatened the Wash
ington goal during the rest of the game.
The varsity came out of the northern
battle in good shape and indications are
that all of the men will be ready to play
against the University of Nevada here
on Saturday. Wilcox is still bothered
with an injured rib, but he will be ready
for action within a day or two, Shlaude
man has water on the elbow, Carter is
still limping from his bad knee, and
Dud DeGroot has water on the knee.
•All of the men will play Saturday, it is
said.
While Saturday was pleasant enough
in Seattle, rain was coming down on
Friday, and in such quantities as to
drench the field and hinder fast work
on the part of the Stanford backs the
next day. The Washington stadium was
full for the Stanford game, and the
northern papers described the affair as
one of the most closely contested and
thrilling battles in football history there.
