# Women's Intercollegiate Conference Opens Session
## 
### Leona Mayer, '23 
That the women of the universities are
vitally interested in the problems con
fronting them, was evident from the en
thusiasm manifested in the first sessions
of the Women's Intercollegiate Confer
ence which opened yesterday in Berke
ley. "Raising Scholarship Standards,"
"Honor Societies," and the "Point Sys
tem" were the subjects under discussion.
Particular interest was added to the
discussion of scholarship by the fact that
it was led by the delegate from Reed
College, Oregon, where the question has
been met in a manner entirely different
from that familiar in other universities.
In Reed, the system of grading has been
completely dispensed with, and the at
tention of the students directed away
from the struggle for marks. Instead of
grades, there arc a certain number of
points given toward graduation for each
course successfully passed, the amount
of credit being increased for successively
high standards of work. All official no
tices have been replaced by personal in
terviews.
Objections were raised to the system
at Reed by the larger universities, who
claimed that although such a system of
personal contact was highly desirable, it
was impossible in an institution where
registration reached the thousand and

ten thousand marks. These larger col
leges, such as California and University
of Washington have raised both their
entrance requiremenV» and their scholas
tic standards.
Many of the colleges have taken the
step which Stanford has just abolished—
that of restricting participation in activ
ities to those students who have attained
a certain level of schorarship. Others
have combined with this a further stimu
lation to better work through fostering
competition among the living groups, a
prize or cup being given to the group
with the best record.
The discussion of the "Point System"
grew directly out of the other topic, in
that the system is one employed by every
university represented, with the excep
tion of Stanford, to keep a balance be
tween college activities and studies.
Every activity is "pointed"—a certain
amount of credit is given for athletics,
dramatics, committees, etc., and only a
limited number of points allowed to each
woman.
The University of California is using
the system not only as a check on those
active in college affairs, but also as a
basis from which to draw into activities
those who would wish to enter them.
Honor societies were considered from
two distinct viewpoints—those of advis
ability and of membership. No definite
conclusions had been reached at the
close of the session, the topic being left
open for further consideration, but there
was a general sentiment that honor so
cieties, to justify their existence, must
have some definite purpose other than a
mere recognition of work already ac
complished.
Whereupon Prytannean, the senior
women's honor society at California, jus
tified itself by taking the entire body of
delegates for a tug ride around San
Francisco Bay. This is the first of the
series of entertainments which have
been planned for the visitors during
their stay here.
