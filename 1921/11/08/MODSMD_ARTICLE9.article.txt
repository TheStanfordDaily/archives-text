tag ends about the University grounds.
The arboretum will be thoroughly gone
over, and all dead wood and unsightly
refuse removed.
All living groups are asked to co-oper
ate to make the campus spotless. Yards

gathered in a pile where men who will
be sent around by the University may
collect it. This material will be called

Following out this idea, it is planned
to have the roofs of both the Union and
Pavilion tiled by November 19. Already
the tiles of the main building of the

one-third covered. Immediately upon
their completion the crew will move to

This floor, in the opinion of experts, is
to be the best basketball surface on the
coast, and will be completed for inspec
tion when visitors arrive for the Stan
ford-California contest.
