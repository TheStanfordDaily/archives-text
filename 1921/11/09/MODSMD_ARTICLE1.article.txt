# SEAYITES MAKE READY TO TRAP BRUINS FRIDAY
## Babes Are in Good Trim and Working Hard; Seconds Play St. Mary's Freshmen 
### 
Coach Seay invaded the varsity field
last evening with his gridmen and took
issue with the second varsity in a
short scrimmage. With the exception
of Dennis and Howard, most of the
freshman first-stringers were not in
the contest.
With the day of the game against
the California Babes almost upon
them, the yearlings are gathering all
strength to give those Blue and Gold
defenders across the bay one of the
best fights they have had in years.
After everything is said, the import
ant fact to put forth about the Babes
is that they are a bunch of fighters
from the first to the last gun. They
have a clean record for the season,
with the expection of the defeat by
Salinas, and this happened when most
of the first-stringers were not in the
play. Even then, it was only a fluke
victory and does not affect the dope.
Seay's backfield men have gradu
ally rounded into a smooth-working
machine and his linemen play low
and hard. They have a good offensive
in both aerial attacks and through the
line. On the defense they have proven
several times during the season that
they can hold like a stone wall at the
crucial moment. Therefore, the vital
questiou affecting the dope is whether
the freshmen play with the consist
ency and dash which they have shown
in several games, or get off on the
wrong foot and put on the erratic,
ragged exhibition which they display
ed against Lincoln high, last Satur
day.
Wittenberg, who has played at half
back, is one of the most valuable men
on the team, for the is able to play
in any position in the backfield. Yes
terday, against the second varsity he
played at full-back, and showed up to
good advantage.
Hoffman, another half-back, has been
steadily coming to the front, and may
get into the game Friday. Wheat,
one of Coach Seay's best bets in the
backfield and in the last two games
playing at quarter, was kicked in the
back during Monday practice and was
not in uniform yesterday. He will
be in shape again by Friday.
Tickets for the Little Big Game will
be one dollar and will be sold at Ber
keley, a section being reserved for
Stanford rooters.
