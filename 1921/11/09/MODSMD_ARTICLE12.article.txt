# BIG GAME STUNTS WILL BE PRACTICED AT BLEACHER RALLY
## Cardinal Yell Kings to Explain Program to Rooters Tomorrow 
### 
The bleacher rally which will take place at the football field at 4 o'clock,
tomorrow afternoon, "will have as its main purpose the practicing of the new
songs. This will possibly be the last bleacher rally at which the Bongs can
be pfacticed previous to the Big Rally on November 17.
The yell leaders are very anxious that a large number of rooters be on
hand. They also ask that everyone who received printed copies of the songs
bring them to the rally. The band has held numerous practices during the
last week and will do its part to make the rally a success.
The varsity football team will have a scrimmage with either the second

varsity or the freshmen players. All
varsity "S" and, numeral men are
asked to wear their sweaters to the
rally.
Owing to the fact that the women
of Stanford were not allowed to par
ticipate in the rally given at the
Southern Pacific depot on Monday
night, when the varsity squad returned
from Seattle, they have signified their
intentions of turning out in larger
numbers tomorrow than they did at
the bleacher rally last Wednesday,
when they numbered about 250. The
women will also have the opportunity
to show the men that the charge,
that they do not yell at the rallies, is
untrue. The yell leaders plan to
have the women give some of the
yells by themselves and in this way
show their ability on organized root
ing, as well as singing. The women
who are making a campaign to have
every woman at the bleacher rally
urge that the women learn the yells
before coming to the rally in order
that a good showing may be made
and the charge proven untrue.
""Because of the large size of the
new stadium the yell leaders state
that it is necessary that every yell
and song be given as clearly as pos
sible in order that everyone may hear
them plainly. It is for this reason
that so many rallies are taking place
in the short time before the Big
Game. The rally committee again
urges that every living group sing the
new songs through several times this
evening, so that all will know the
words on Thursday.
The yell leaders wish it announced
that a rooting section will be formed
at the Stanford-California freshman
game at Berkeley on Friday. The new
songs will not be used at this game.
