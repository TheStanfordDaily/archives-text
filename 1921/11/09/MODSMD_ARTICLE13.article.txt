# DELEGATES FAVOR SPECIAL TRAINING
## Intercollegiate Conference at Berkeley Approves the Vocational Plan for Women 
### Leona Mayer, '24 
Centering on the question of the re
lation of specialization for vocational
training, to the regular academic course,
the discussion at the Tuesday morning
session of the Women's Conference in
dicated a general sentiment in favor of
more specific vocational preparation in
college.
"Do college women enter with no
plan, or it is the fault of the university
that students graduate after four years,
entirely incapable of earning their
way?" This was the question brought
up by the California delegation. That
the fault rests chiefly with the curricula
in the various universities seems to be
proven by the absence from most of
such departments as journalism, secre
tarial training, etc., in contrast with
the success of these departments where
they are established.
In Washington State College, where
there is offered definite secretarial train
ing, preparation for work in fisheries,
a teaching certificate after four years,
and a course in library work—all but
one of those applying for positions after
graduation were placed within two
months.
Such courses as medicine naturally
and justly require almost an entire col
lege course /before (Specialization can
begin, but in many of the other depart
ments a four years' course leading to
nowhere is a very futile pursuit. Voca
tional conferences were suggested as a
solution to the problem, and a committee
was appointed to try to arrange for a
national conference, as a step toward
helping the women find their rightful
places as useful, working members and
leaders in the community.
Following a luncheon given by the
Mothers' Club at Stiles Hall, the con
ference resumed its session with a fur
ther discussion of honor societies. A
committee was appointed, of which
Mary Matthews, '22, is a member, to
consider the advisability of establishing
a national women's honor society, such
as "Cap and Gown" or "Mortar Board.'
The ensuing discussion on "Student
Government" revealed the fact that, with
the exception of the University of Cali
fornia. Stanford has more freedom al
lowed to her women than any other
university represented. Self-government
is an established working principle in
all the universities, and Stanford's is
among the few whose government is
successful in all units and groups on
the campus. Arizona, especially, has had
difficulty in governing the women's
dormitory, and have decided to apply
the principles of representative ruling
which forms the basis of Roble's sys
tem.
A reception, given at the President's
home by Mrs. David P. Barrows, con
cluded the activities of the conference
for the day. For tomorrow is planned
the joint session of the Student Con
ference and the Conference of the Dean
of Women. "Student-Faculty Coopera
tion" is the topic, to be presented from
both the viewpoints involved.

both the viewpoints involved.
Centering on the question of the re
lation of specialization for vocational
training, to the regular academic course,
the discussion at the Tuesday morning
session of the Women's Conference in
dicated a general sentiment in favor of
more specific vocational preparation in
college.
"Do college women enter with no
plan, or it is the fault of the university
that students graduate after four years,
entirely incapable of earning their
way?" This was the question brought
up by the California delegation. That
the fault rests chiefly with the curricula
in the various universities seems to be
proven by the absence from most of
such departments as journalism, secre
tarial training, etc., in contrast with
the success of these departments where
they are established.
In Washington State College, where
there is offered definite secretarial train
ing, preparation for work in fisheries,
a teaching certificate after four years,
and a course in library work—all but
one of those applying for positions after
graduation were placed within two
months.
Such courses as medicine naturally
and justly require almost an entire col
lege course /before (Specialization can
begin, but in many of the other depart
ments a four years' course leading to
nowhere is a very futile pursuit. Voca
tional conferences were suggested as a
solution to the problem, and a committee
was appointed to try to arrange for a
national conference, as a step toward
helping the women find their rightful
places as useful, working members and
leaders in the community.
Following a luncheon given by the
Mothers' Club at Stiles Hall, the con
ference resumed its session with a fur
ther discussion of honor societies. A
committee was appointed, of which
Mary Matthews, '22, is a member, to
consider the advisability of establishing
a national women's honor society, such
as "Cap and Gown" or "Mortar Board.'
The ensuing discussion on "Student
Government" revealed the fact that, with
the exception of the University of Cali
fornia. Stanford has more freedom al
lowed to her women than any other
university represented. Self-government
is an established working principle in
all the universities, and Stanford's is
among the few whose government is
