second, Snedden (S) third.
Relay — Won by Neptune. Time,
1:(>7 3-5.
Neptune Club of Alameda proved a
rather easy obstacle for the varsity team,
and Coach Brandsten's charges captured
the meet last night in the Olympic Club
tank by a 41 to 27 score. The Cardinal
won seven out of the eight events, and
topped off the evening by trouncing the
Alamedans at water polo, 4 to 2.
Greppin, the tall sophomore, furnished
the sensation of the evening in the 220
yards. For five out of the six laps, he
lagged behind Luster, one of the best
220 men on the coast, but on the final
lap he uncorked a fast spurt, finishing
first in 2 minutes and 49 seconds.
Fletcher's contribution to the Cardinal
total was ten points. He beat Wallace of
the Neptunes in the breast stroke by
three yards, and a few minutes later re
peated the process in the back stroke.
In the 100 yards, Ryan, a Neptune
man, and one of his teammates led the
field for 80 yards, with Austin and
Drake swimming easily in third and
fourth places. In the last fifteen yards
Austin let himself go, and finished first.
Drake came in second, but through an
oversight, the judges awarded second
place to Ryan.
The Stanford divers, White and Sned
den, went up against some stiff competi
tion in Joseph, one of the best on the
coast, but White won the event, and
Snedden just" barely lost out to Joseph
for second.
Stanford's 4 to 2 victory in the water
polo means that the Cardinals are al
most assured of second place in the na
tional championships. The Neptunes
presented their strongest lineup, while
Stanford played the first half with two
substitutes. The Neptunes were con
sidered the second best junior team.
