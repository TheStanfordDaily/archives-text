University officials have announced the opening of
a drive to clean up the campus before the influx of
65,000 visitors to the Big Game begins. In order to
carry out successfully the campaign for a "spick and
span" campus they have asked the aid of every
living group. Every organization is asked to see
that its own backyard, as well as the front yard and
the side-yards, are free from rubbish, papers, and
other materials which collect. University workmen
will see that the University backyard and streets are
presentable by that day.
Just ten days remain to clean up the farm. Then
the Cardinal football team will essay a clean-up on
the Bruin eleven. Alxntt sixty men and four
coaches have been laboring two hours nightly, and
giving much of time and effort, to assure the football
clean-up in the new stadium on November 19.
Stanford students are asked to spend just the
smallest parts of ten days to see that the home of the
University is ship-shape on that day.
The crowd that will gather to see the two clean
ups will be the same and will number about 65,000.
Many of them will be visiting Stanford for the first
time. First appearances usually count most in the
estimate of a person or a place. There is no doubt
that the appearance of the eleven Stanford stalwarts
on the gridiron that day will incite the admiration of
the gathered throng. Whether they will admire the
home of Stanford students depends entirely upon the
co-operation given to the University officials.
