That there is no honor among thieves is a very
true saying, for Stanford is learning daily that there
arc thieves among honorable men and women.
Petty thieving on the campus is on the increase
rather than on the wane, as it should be under the
1 lonor System which is seemingly so strongly
intrenched here. This is not a sign that the Honor
System is not functioning as it should. At the
beginning of every school year there are always a
number of thefts rej)orted, and these continue for a
few weeks until the irresponsibles and those lacking
in common morals can be weeded out and expelled
from the University. The situation is more serious
this year because the student body is larger.
Reports from the gymnasium are that the coaches'
room has been gone through twice, apparently by a
person thoroughly acquainted with the surroundings
and the habits of the coaching staffs. Thieving in
the dormitories and along the quadrangle is also
cleverly done, as most work of this kind generally is.
There is only one remedy for the situation. Every
member of the student body should keep a careful
watch for suspicious characters. If you see things
which really arouse your suspicions, report them
quietly to the Men's Council or the Women's Con
ference, as the case may be. These two Ixnlies know
the proper procedure for such cases.
Petty thieving must be stamped out. There is
and always will be among twenty-seven hundred
people some who do not fit into the recognized
scheme of things. These must be searched out and
properly dealt with, and it is a matter in which the
entire body of students must co-operatej
