# Clean-Up Day.

### 
The last big bleacher rally of the season is
scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. Stanford stu
dents will be given one final chance to turn out on
the stands and voice their support to the team. The
importance of these mid-week turnouts has been
emphasized many times during the last few weeks.
Last Wednesday the students flocked to the football
field only to learn that the new songs could not be
practiced because most of the band had not arrived.
It was too bad that those in charge of the rally did
not think of some device to overcome the absence of
the musicians. The students were there and readv

to practice, but they were unable to because of an
unfortunate circumstance.
That this will not occur again is the promise of
the committeemen in charge of rallies and stunts.
Tomorrow the band will be out in force and ready to
produce the music that will be as henbane in the ears
of the Blue and Gold supporters when accompanied
by the voices of some twenty-five hundred Stanford
rooters. If you are for the team and enjoy rallies,
don't fail to be at this last bleacher assembly. If you
are prone to view a rally as a matter of duty, don't.
Stay at home.
