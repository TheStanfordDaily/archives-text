do you play chopsticks?

the first sentence, or the want ads?

It's a common dilemma, as they say in Logic. There
fore, Cabbages has prepared a series of formulas en
titled, "How to Greet a Friend Whose Name You Have
Forgotten," to be used when the embarrassing occasion
arises. Here they are:
* * *
The first time, it will probably catch you unawares,
so just lower your head for a line plunge, grunt "Hello,
there, umph!" and keep on walking; "umph" standing
for Charley, Jack, Bill, Al, or even Marcus Aurelius.
* * «
The second time, cover up your embarrassment with
a "Hello, old man!" or, if he's a good sport, "Hello,
old egg!"
* * *
The third time it happens, look intelligently (it can
be done), just as if you knew his name, but weren't
going to take the trouble to say it. "Cheerio!" or
"Hi, there!" or even "Well, well, well!" All go good
if you don't stop too long.
* * *
If a fourth time occurs, approach him confidently,
slap him on the back, mutter in his ear, "Who in
(CENSORED) are you, anyway?" and walk briskly
away. There won't be any fifth time.
• * *
And there's another matter that needs immediate at
tention. Did you ever meet someone on the Quad or
elsewhere, who chirped out your name cheerily while
you racked the old bean trying to remember who it was?
If you never did, you're a hermit and aren't reading
this colyum.
