# DR. EVERMAN URGES NEED FOR INTEREST IN MARINE MAMMALS

"Information is necessary to beget in
terest in anything, and information about
the various marine mammals of the Pa
cific coast is necessary to arouse the in
terest which will result in measures
taken for their protection," said Dr. B.
W. Everinan, from California Academy
of Sciences, when he addressed the
Zoology Club at the home of Dr. Snyder,
last night.
He spoke principally of the fur-bear
ing seal and the measures which had
been taken several years ago to prevent
their extermination. "Pelagic hunting
had been so extensive that the species
were almost demolished," said Dr. Ever
inan, "and while the government did take
steps to prevent further destruction they
were not effective. The first measure
taken in this direction was the fur-seal
treaty, and when Japan was left out of
this she promptly retaliated by hunting
all the way up to the three-mile limit.
So the treaty was made anew, this time
including japan and Russia. From 1911
there has been comparative protection
for the fur-bearing seal.
"The National Research Committee
formed during the war, and now foster
ing scientific research, has provided for
a committee on the conservation of ma
rine life in the Pacific, and this commit
tee's plan is to interest all institutions on
the Pacific coast that are in any way
connected with this question. It hopes
to obtain results in increased informa
tion and co-operation in preserving the
marine mammals on this coast. It will
then extend its scope to the Pacific states
in South America, and with their aid en
listed, the problem will finally be as
sured of efficient solution."
