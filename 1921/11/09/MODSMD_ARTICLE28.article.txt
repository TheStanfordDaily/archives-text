# Eyefullitis, A Most Peculiar Campus Disease
## 
### 
This is a story about eyes —just plain,
blue eyes and brown eyes and all the
afflictions that these eyes can suffer. It
is prompted by the constantly increas
ing number of male patients undergoing
treatment at the Peninsula Hospital for
optical troubles. The wise men down
there shake their heads and mutter,
"Too bad, too bad," and the disillusioned
patient takes the noon train to the city
to go shopping for a pair of serviceable,
but cheap, glass eyes!
And all the time no one seems to
really know just what the matter is.
But a little bird told us the trouble and
we're going to pass it along down to
you—<if you'll promise to never, never
tell a single living soul!
Eight fascinatingly beautiful bells
comprise the chorus of the famous
Chappie football show. They are re
hearsing daily—and nightly, too—in the
Assembly Hall in preparation for the
big event. Peep-holes in the wall have

been at a premium, and lucky has been
the mere man who gets within the sacred
portals. Is it any wonder then that
such an epidemic of "eyefullitis" is
sweeping the campus at this time?
But never mind, boys; just a few
days more and you can buy a ticket and
come inside and then you won't have to
strain your eyes at the portholes any
longer. And then the epidemic will sub
side, and the Peninsula Hospital will be
deserted and alone, and the wise men
there will mournfully shake their heads
and mutter, "Too bad, too bad"!
