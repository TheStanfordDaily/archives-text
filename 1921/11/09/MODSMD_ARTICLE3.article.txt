# Reef the Sheets Boys, It's a Rough Day Hard Ahead
## 
### 
Make way for the roughs!
This will be the cry on Wednesday,
November 16, which has been set aside
for observation of the appropriate rites
and ceremonies of the Grand Order of
Roughs, under the leadership of Ken
Lilly, Grand Imperial Rough, assisted
by Grand Rough Goblins. These will
be Mark Evans, dignitary in charge of
the engineering corner division; Ben
Parks, law step division, and Earl
Crowe, the Econ Steps lodge.
Shows will be staged by each division
between classes. Stunt competitions
will be keenly carried on, each group
striving to carry off honors for being
the roughest.
At 4 p. m. the grand lodge session
will be convened in the new stadium,
where the Roughs will parade in re
view at the bleacher rally which will
then be held.
This rally will be the final one before
the Big Game, and last instructions will
be given concerning the bleacher stunts
to be given and arrangements made for
seating at the contest.
The ban on shaves begins Monday
morning. White collars, regular neck
wear and effete wearing apparel of all
sorts and description have been strictly
barred by the Grand Imperial Council
of Roughs, and violators will receive
due punishment.
