# GLEE CLUB'S TRIP TO MEXICO IS POSTPONED
## 
### 
The proposed trip of the Stanford
Glee Club to Mexico during the Christ
mas vacation has been indefinitely
postponed until the spring quarter, it
was announced today.
It was found by those arranging for
the proposed trip that it would be
possible to lake but a small numbei
according to the present prospects,
as a sufficient number of concerts
could not be arranged in the two
weeks to pay expenses for a larger
group.
