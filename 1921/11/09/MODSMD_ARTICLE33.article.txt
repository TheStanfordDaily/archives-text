# MARIE BASHIAN SINGS ARMENIAN BALLADS
## 
### 
Marie Bashian gave a recital of folk
songs of the Orient and the Occident
in the Little Theater last evening. Miss
Bashian has a sweet soprano voice
which is especially adapted to these lit
tle songs of the people. Her personality
and ingenuous air added color to her
program. She is Armeniaan, but sings
English with very small trace of ac
cent.
The program was divided into three
parts, the first of which was a group
of English ballads. Several of these
were quaint songs which date back to
the seventeenth century. "Golden Slum
bers" was a lullaby full of faint, lulling
notes. The next number was "The Lass
With the Delicate Air," a lilting mel
ody. Miss Bashian gave a Scotch bal
lad, "Charlie Is My Darlin,'" as an
encore to this portion of the program.
Old Russian folk songs formed the
second part of the recital. For these
Miss Bashian appeared in a Russian
peasant costume. The first of these was
a "Volga Boatman's Song," which he
sings while he is pulling his barge up
the river. He sings, as Miss Bashian
explained, to lighten the burden of his
work and urges the barge on past each
land mark which he sees ahead. "The
Red Sarafan" is the story of a young
girl who is about to be married, and
begs her mother to allow her to stay at
home longer, while her mother tells her
that she must be married while she is
young. The sarafan is the Russian
peasant costume.
The final selections were old Arme
nian folk songs which Miss Bashian
sang in her native tongue. The Arme
nian peasant songs have been collected
and put to music by Comitas Vartabet,
an Armenian bishop, who is thought to
be the greatest musical authority in the
Near East, and with whom Miss Bash
ian studied for several years. When lie
was trying to find the songs, he could
not persuade any of the peasants to
sing them for him, and resorted to the
strategy of hiding behind trees and lis
tening while the people, unembarrassed
by his presence, danced and sang their
ballads. "They arc," said Miss Bashian,
"little pastoral tone pictures of rustic
life. They are passed down from one
generation to another aind are very,
very old."
"The Dancing Maiden" is a typical
dance song of Armenia and Russia.
There are two distinct movements to it.
The first is very slow, with a graceful
swing and suddenly it turns into a lively
air. "The Plowman's Song" gives a
picture of the plowman who is goading
his big. black oxen and patiently coax
ing them to move on. Miss Bashian
ended the program with the "Hymn to
Armenia," a song of devotion and faith
ful love of the Armenians for their
mother country.
Miss Bashian is working for the aid
of the Armenian students who come to
American universities to study. She
says that it requires over three months
after they arrive here for them to learn
the fundamentals of American ways and
to be assured that there is nothing to
fear here as there is in Armenia.

work and urges the barge on past each
land mark which he sees ahead. "The
Red Sarafan" is the story of a young
girl who is about to be married, and
begs her mother to allow her to stay at
home longer, while her mother tells her
that she must be married while she is
young. The sarafan is the Russian
peasant costume.
The final selections were old Arme
nian folk songs which Miss Bashian
sang in her native tongue. The Arme
nian peasant songs have been collected
and put to music by Comitas Vartabet,
an Armenian bishop, who is thought to
be the greatest musical authority in the
Near East, and with whom Miss Bash
ian studied for several years. When lie
was trying to find the songs, he could
not persuade any of the peasants to
sing them for him, and resorted to the
strategy of hiding behind trees and lis
tening while the people, unembarrassed
by his presence, danced and sang their
ballads. "They arc," said Miss Bashian,
"little pastoral tone pictures of rustic
life. They are passed down from one
generation to another aind are very,
very old."
"The Dancing Maiden" is a typical
dance song of Armenia and Russia.
There are two distinct movements to it.
The first is very slow, with a graceful
swing and suddenly it turns into a lively
air. "The Plowman's Song" gives a
picture of the plowman who is goading
his big. black oxen and patiently coax
ing them to move on. Miss Bashian
ended the program with the "Hymn to
Armenia," a song of devotion and faith
ful love of the Armenians for their
mother country.
Miss Bashian is working for the aid
of the Armenian students who come to
American universities to study. She
says that it requires over three months
after they arrive here for them to learn
the fundamentals of American ways and
to be assured that there is nothing to
fear here as there is in Armenia.
Marie Bashian gave a recital of folk
songs of the Orient and the Occident
in the Little Theater last evening. Miss
Bashian has a sweet soprano voice
which is especially adapted to these lit
tle songs of the people. Her personality
and ingenuous air added color to her
program. She is Armeniaan, but sings
English with very small trace of ac
cent.
The program was divided into three
parts, the first of which was a group
of English ballads. Several of these
were quaint songs which date back to
the seventeenth century. "Golden Slum
bers" was a lullaby full of faint, lulling
notes. The next number was "The Lass
With the Delicate Air," a lilting mel
ody. Miss Bashian gave a Scotch bal
lad, "Charlie Is My Darlin,'" as an
encore to this portion of the program.
Old Russian folk songs formed the
second part of the recital. For these
Miss Bashian appeared in a Russian
peasant costume. The first of these was
a "Volga Boatman's Song," which he
sings while he is pulling his barge up
the river. He sings, as Miss Bashian
explained, to lighten the burden of his
work and urges the barge on past each
land mark which he sees ahead. "The
Red Sarafan" is the story of a young
girl who is about to be married, and
begs her mother to allow her to stay at
home longer, while her mother tells her
that she must be married while she is
young. The sarafan is the Russian
