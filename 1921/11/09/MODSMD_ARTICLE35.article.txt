# FRESHMEN TO FELL TREES BY STADIUM FOR HUGE BONFIRE
## 
### 
The bonfire will be located just east of
the ruins of the old library, was the
final decision of the bonfire committee at
its meeting in the Union last night. The
reason for the selection is the advantage
of the sloping condition of the field.
As a natural drain, it will not necessitate
the freshmen plodding through mud in
case o frain.
The felling of twelve of the tall euca
lyptus trees across from the stadium
started today at the hands of the fresh
men. The trees, which obstructed the
view of the Quad from the stadium, will
make excellent corner posts for the fire.
The Corporation Yard will supply all
necessary wagons and implements, so
lack of tools will be no excuse for
idleness.
To Comptroller Roth goes the credit
of saving the Babes many sore feet and
stiff backs, for he has had university
workmen collecting brush for several
weeks.
Each freshman will work twenty-one
hours, and may choose his own schedule.
Besides the allotted number of hours,
there will be guard duty assignments.
It is the desire of the committee in
charge to have the bonfire to tower
above last year's. To make this possible
the co-operation of every freshman is
needed. Those who have not reported
on the fields by Thursday must have a
very good reason for their tardiness.
A novel design has been worked out
to burn on the top of the bonfire, the
committee announces. What shape it'
will take will be a mystery until the
night before the game.
George Menees, "Scotchy" Campbell,
A1 Loewenstein, and "Lefty" Mays com
pose the sophomores in charge of the
bonfire. The slave-drivers will be: Nip
McHose, Joe Clark, Eddie Sudden, Jack
Fishburn, George Shoemhair, "Sticky"
Wilson, Bob Titus, Orville Tucker, Har
vey Coverly, Creig Dunbar, and Cliet
Gunther.
