# CARDS TO BATTLE NEVADA SATURDAY
## Van Gent Prepares Squad for Last Game of Season Until Affair With Blue and Gold 
### 
Behind barred doors, Gene Van
Gent and other Stanford football
coaches began the last lap on the 1921
grid season, last night.
The University of Nevada eleven,
led by Jimmy ("Rabbit") Bradshaw,
is the one team that will meet the
Cardinals before the big game with
California, on November 19. Satur
day's game with the Nevada team
should be as sensational as any of
the affairs seen here this year.
Despite the handicap of a small
student body, "Corky" Cortwright, the
coach of the Sagebrushers, has devel
oped a dangerous organization. Most
of the plays are built around Brad
shaw, called the most elusive thing
in a football suit in the west. Brad
shaw is comparatively small but he
is speedy, clever, experienced {ind
possesses a wonderful dodging ability
that has made him the star of prac
tically every game that Nevada has
played in the last two years.
But Bradshaw is not the only man
that the Cardinals must watch Satur
day, for in Reed, the visitors have a
player who is adept at receiving for
ward passes. He is the man who
scored against California early in the
season. The Bradshaw-Reed combina
tion is dangerous from any place in
the field.
To realize just how powerful an or
ganization Nevada has, one must only
recoil the score of their battle with
Bill Ingram's Pacific Fleet. The fleet
only won, 14 to 13 in a game that
was undecided until the final gun
sounded.
Van Gent knows that his men will
not have a set-up. He will undoubted
ly start what he considers his strong
est combination, provided, of course,
injuries do not prevent.
Art Wilcox may or may not play.
The star Cardinal halfback is in none
too good a condition and he must be
i?aved as much as possible for the
game with the Bruins the following
week.
Bob Shlaudeman will be in good
shape for the Nevada game and the
fans expect to see a real contest in
broken field running when he and
"Rabbit" Bradshaw get to going.
The Cards got some good practice
stopping these elusive fellows at Se
attle last Saturday. Ray Eckmann,
the Washington captain, gave the fans
a few treats at running back punts.
On two occasions he carried Jack
Patrick's boots back fully thirty-five
yards before he was spilled.
The Nevada varsity will arrive on
the campus Friday, according to word
from the graduate manager's office.
They will probably take a short work
out on the Stanford turf in the after
noon.
