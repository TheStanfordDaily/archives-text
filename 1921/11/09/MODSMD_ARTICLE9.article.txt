# LYNCH TO SPEAK ON DISARMAMENT
## Disarmament and Its Relation to Commercial Affairs Will be Discussed by S. F. Man 
### 
"American Business and the Confer
ence for the Limitation of Arms," will
be the subject of a talk to be given to
night in the Little Theatre by Robert
Newton Lynch, vice-president of the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce.
This will be the third of a series of talks
by prominent outside men, given under
the auspices of the World Problems
Forum of the local Y. M. C. A., as was
Chester Rowell's speech on "The Pa
cific Problem," two weeks ago.
Lynch, in his position as one of the
chief officers of San Francisco's com
mercial body, has an interesting fund of
information relating to practical affairs
of the present day. He is known outside
of San Francisco, as well, as one who
has his linger on the pulse of business,
and can tell, in large measure, what the
effect of any important national or inter
national move will be, as regards the
business world.
One of these important moves will
commence Friday, on November 11,
Armistice Day, when delegates from all
the principal nations of the world con
vene to thresh out the problem of heavy
armament burdens. The core of the
problem being largely a financial one,
the effect of the armament conference
on the business of the United States is
of the first importance. Lynch will point
out, in his talk, what it will mean to
the commercial life of America if the
conference succeeds or fails.
Lynch has traveled widely, and so has
first-hand information on which-to base
his remarks. Some time ago he made
an extensive tour through Japan, repre
senting the business interests of the Pa
cific Coast, and, on this trip, was able to
get a personal impression of how the
Japanese feel and what their problems
of today are. As the question of the
Far East is conceded by most observers
to be the greatest stumbling block in the
way of immediate universal concord,
Lynch's understanding of Japan fur
nishes a good basis for discussing the
most important phases of the disarma
ment problem.
Everyone is invited to attend. The
talk will start at 7:30.
