# CARDS, SAGEBRUSHERS ON EDGE FOR TILT SATURDAY
## Varsity Expects to Stop Reed, Bradshaw Offense Combination 
### 
That the Stanford varsity does not
figure to easily defeat "Corky" Cort
wright and his University of Nevada
Sagebrtishers here Saturday is evi
denced by the preparations that Gene
Van Gent and the Card coaches are
making these days for the game.
Secret practice has been on the list
since the team returned from Seattle,
and was broken only by today's rally in
the bleachers.
When Cortwright was here to scout
the Stanford team at the Oregon Aggie
affair he expressed the opinion that his
squad would be able to hold its own with
the Cardinals, despite the fact that man
for man Stanford would hold a ten
pound weight advantage.
Nevada has had a checkered career
this season, but they have scored in
every game that they have played, even
driving down the field against Cali
fornia and worming the ball over the
goal line on forward passes.
The Bruins defeated the Sagebrushers
52 to 6. That doesn't speak too well for
Cortwright's outfit. But aside from that
one tussle, Nevada has held its own.
Bill Ingram's Pacific Fleet aggregation
was able to win only by a one-point
margin, and yet the fleet dented Stan
ford 27 to 7. It has been claimed that
the high Nevada altitude bothered the
navy team considerably.
Cortwright's men trampled over the
University of Utah eleven last Saturday
without much difficulty. They will ar
rive here tomorrow in time to take a
short workout on the Stanford turf, it
is believed.
The Nevada team is hoping to trim
the Cardinals in their own backyard, and
in this way to firmly establish the po
sition they have attained in football dur
ing the last two seasons.
Stanford should win, but the score
promises to be close. Seldom has any
team possessed two such stars like
Jimmy Bradshaw and Reed, as does Ne
vada's. They are both marvels in the
open field, and will prqbably be marked
men Saturday.
The Stanford lineup for the tilt has
not been definitely announced. Con
sidering that Art Wilcox will be able to
start at left half, the regular backfield
will probably be in action. Bob Shlaude
man will call signals, with Ray Doughty
at right half and Captain Jack Patrick
at fullback.
From tackle to tackle the Card line
seems to be pretty well settled, and it is
thought that the men Van Gent will send
in to start against Nevada will be those
that open against California a week from
Saturday.
Dud DeGroot is down for center, Dick
Faville and "Red" Betts for guards, and
Fred Ludeke and Harley Carter for
tackles.
It is the wing positions that give Van
Gent and Line Coach Canning the most
trouble. "Kewp" Sproull is still on the
shelf with a sprained wrist and he will
be unable to get into the game against
Nevada. "Shorty" Mertz and Dick
Pershing will probably open up Satur
day.
The Nevada-Stanford tilt will start at
2:30, it is announced. Student body
cards will admit holders.
