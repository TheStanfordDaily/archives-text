# CARDINAL BABES FACE BRUIN CUBS IN FINAL GRID BATTLE TOMORROW
## LITTLE BIG GAME TO BE FOUGHT ON CALIFORNIA TURF SEA Y'S WARRIORS IN FIGHTING TRIM AND ARE OUT FOR BLOOD 
### (By C. H. PRIOR, '23 
Tomorrow at 2:30 o'clock on the Berkeley field, the Cardinal Babes meet
the Bruin Cubs in the Little Big Game of the season.
Dope or no dope, ragged game last Saturday or no ragged game, Coach
Seay's fighting yearlings are invading the Blue and Gold camp with the de
termination to bring home a victory. When the freshmen have gone good
they have gone mighty good, and when they have played ragged they have
looked bad.
One thing is certain. If the Babes beat "Pesky" Sprott's cub warriors
they will have to play real football from the first to the last gun. Sprott's
men beat the Berkeley High squad by a 14 to 7 score while the Seayites had
to be satisfied with a 7 to 7 tie. It can be said that the Stanford freshmen
played two games on the day they met Berkeley, and for that reason did not
have their strongest line-up against the trans-bay preppers.
Sprott took his men south last Saturday and was handed a 14 to 7 defeat
by the U. S. C. freshmen. Seay's squad went against Lincoln High here on
the same day and were just able to squeeze through with a 21 to 14 victory.

There was no excuse for the type of
game which the Babes exhibited last
Saturday. That kind of football will
not beat California.
Athletic Director Walter Powell put
the proposition squarely before the
freshmen last evening in these words:
"You men have the best chance to beat
California that any Cardinal freshmen
team has ever had. You have a chance
to make Stanford history. The outcome
of Friday's contest rests with each man
on this team. If any man comes from
that field without the inward satisfac
tion of having done his best in every
play, there is something wrong with
him and he is not a Stanford man."
Coach Seay put his men through the
last practice scrimmage of the season
yesterday afternoon, when the first and
second yearling squads met on their
own field. The men looked good and
there was a certain grim earnestness, a
tense alertness, which was outward evi
dence of the attitude the Babes will
take in Friday's game. They will not be
overconfident; neither will they lack
the fighting spirit. From the way each
man stood ready 011 his toes while Den
nis barked the signals, it can be said
that the attitude will be: "We are going
to give those Bruins the fight of their
lives, and the game is not over until the
final gun."
Powell was out on the field working
with the linemen, giving them the final
touches; perfecting their charges and
blocking; instructing them in the numer
ous details of their positions which make
for victory or defeat. Coach Seay and
Bob Cravens spent most of their time
I with the backfield. They have it work
| ing as a unit and with the proper sup
port of the line, the Cardinal offensive
will be hard to stop.
Assistant Coach Malarkey drilled the
second squad before the scrimmage and
took charge of the punters.
There is no exaggeration or senti
mental jingo in the assertion that the
very atmosphere around the yearling
field last evening was one of confidence
combined with a grim, savage attitude
which augurs ill for the Bears across
the bay. With this attitude in the game
tomorrow, the Babes will not lose.
Janssen and Fuller will start at the
ends and the playing of these two men
is expected to add great strength to
the Cardinal aerial attack, their speed
proving a constant menace to the
Bruins when Seay's men are on the deÂ»
fense.
