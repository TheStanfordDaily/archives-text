# WOMEN WILL MEET MILLS IN HOCKEY GAMES SATURDAY
## 
### 
The first women's intercollegiate
hockey games of the season will be
played when the Stanford teams go up
to meet Mills, at Mills College Saturday
morning. With the conclusion of the
junior-senior game this afternoon, the
two weeks preliminary games come to
an end. By putting tlie women through
hard practice every afternoon of the
past fortnight and enforcing strict ob
servance of the training rules, Miss
Helen Bunting and Miss Pasmore have
built up teams that will give the Mills
women a strong defense to fight against.
Excellent teamwork and fast play fea
tured the work of the sophomore squad
against the freshmen last Tuesday. The
spectacular 75-yard run to a score which
Constance Tamplin made in that game is
an example of the speed of which the
'24 team is capable.
The final preliminary this afternoon
between juniors and seniors will decide
which team will represent Stanford
upperclass women in the Mills competi
tion. Though the seniors have lost some
of their last year players, they have
shown fine work in practicc and pre
liminaries. The junior squad contains
a lot of good material in experienced
players and has developed a strong for
ward line.
All women who wish to see the games
on Saturday should give their names to
Geraldine Franklin, '24, at the Delta
Gamma house. Special busses have been
secured to take the teams and rooters
to the city. The round trip fare is $3.
Every women who can possibly arrange
to go is needed to support the teams.
