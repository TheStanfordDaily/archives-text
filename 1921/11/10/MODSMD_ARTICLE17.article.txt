# Armistice Day.
## 
### 
Armistice Day will he a University holiday. Every
student will he free tomorrow to spend the day as
he chooses. Armistice Day commemorates the cul
mination of one of the hloodiest and costliest wars
ever fought in the history of mankind. It is a day
that will recall to many minds memories of those
who gave their lives to uphold certain recognized
principles of mankind in order to preserve the lib
erty of the world.
Still it is not a day for sadness. Wars have been
regarded as a necessary thing of the world, and wars
entail terrible human sacrifices. But Armistice Day
celebrates what many hope will be the end of all
wholesale strifes, and many who are not necessarily
idealists believe that the lessons coming from the
last great war will eventually lead to an everlasting
peace. Whether this proves to be true is a matter
which the future will decide. Certainly Armistice
Day should l>e a day of rejoicingâ€”not one in which
sad memories overshadow the joy of the day.
Stanford students have Armistice Day to spend
as they wish. They should spend it properly.
