# The 						Test.
## 
### 
Stanford's Freshmen will have a chance tomorrow
to demonstrate their right to be called real Stanford
men. At Berkeley the eleven of the class of 1925
will encounter for the first time men of the Uni
versity of California in an athletic contest. They
will enter the strife that is as old as Stanford Uni
versity itself. It is their test.
The first-year men are prepared for the greatest
athletic event of their entering year. The turnout
of candidates for the Babe eleven on September 20
was the largest ever recorded at Stanford. The men
have stayed faithfully with practices. They have
worked and are ready, lhe eleven will fight hard.
It has learned during the preliminary games that
Stanford teams never fail to give all that is in them.
1 omorrow afternoon they will prove to the rest of
the student body that they are already imbued with
the true Stanford spirit. They will fight to the end
and they will play clean, remembering always that
Stanford Spirit means good sportsmanship that
never admits defeat until the game is over.
