# On to Berkeley.
## 
### 
Since tomorrow is a University holiday, every
student of the University, man and woman, should
entrain for Berkeley to support Stanford's first-year
football eleven in the little big game. The Babes
will be fighting an up-hill fight. They are out to
upset the belief that Stanford freshmen never win
from California. They will want the support of
every Stanford student.
Coach Duffy Seay and his assistants, Malarkey.
Cravens, and McCreery, have labored hard to mold
the hundred-odd men who turned out for football
practice into a winning football team. Tomorrow
they take the product of their labors to Berkeley,
where it will be given the supreme test. Everyone
who knows anything about football at all believes
that the Freshmen have more than an even chance to
defeat the Bruiji Cubs. The team itself is confident
that it can win.
Every student of Stanford should make it a point
to see that the Cardinal Babes do not fight their big
battle alone. Encouragement from the bleachers is
an immeasurable aid to any athletic team. Support
the Babes at Berkeley.
o
There will be no issue of the Daily Palo Alto
tomorrow on account of the holiday due to the ob
servation of Armistice Day.
