# SOCCER ELEVEN WILL MEET U. S. I. TEAM
## 
### 
Saturday the Stanford soccer varsity
will meet the Unione Sportiva Italian
Club of San Francisco on their Twelfth
and Mission street turf. This will be
the last soccer game before the first
Stanford-California scrap, and although
the Sportiva Club is the lowest in the
University and Club Soccer League,
Coach Maloney will take no chances in
losing the game. For this reason Stan
ford's strongest varsity will journey to
San Francisco ready to prevent any un
fortunate upsetting of the dope.
No chances in the regular lineup will
be made unless Peavy, the star Cardinal
inside right, is unable to get into the
game. In case that he is unable to play,
DefFenbach will substitute. Peavy in
jured his right arch in the Olympic
Club game, and while he may not be in
condition to play in Saturday's game,
his foot will doubtless be well in time
for the meet with California.
The men who will go to the city Sat
urday arc: Masters, gg; Mendonca, rf;
Hayes, If; Gorman (captain) rh; Robin
son, ch; Taylor, lb; Dwight, or; Peavy
or DefFenbach, ir; Clark, df; Mesa, il;
Elmore, 01.
