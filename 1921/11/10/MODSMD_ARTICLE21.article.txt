I KNEAD THEE EVERY HOUR—Sung by the baker
to his dough.
MA, HE'S KISSING ME—Sung by Miss Billiard Ball.
COME JOIN THE BAND —With chorus of "ba-a-a-s,"
by bell bether.

Dear Head of Cabbage:—Please tell Carl and Hal
they can't josh me out tof writing co-ed ditties because
I don't discuss what our better fifth wears or other such
stuff that even Chappie has come to ban. I rather pre
fer humor so tainted with philosophy that even mem
bers of the Faculty will read the Cabbage Colyum. For
instance, the following attempt:
* * *
There's a little Frosh
Co-ed
On this campus
Who likes to gather some admirers
Of the opposite sex
Around her
In front of the class-room
Or library, or law steps, or any old place
Where crowds be
And show off for all she's worth
Posing every second
And some one of these nights
There'll be a crowd around her
Enjoying themselves
On the ballroom floor
While the wall-flowers look on
That's the kind that get them.
There's a little Frosh
Gent
On this campus
Who likes to gather some admirers
Of the opposite sex *
Around him
In front of the class-room
Or library, or law steps, or any old place
Where crowds be
And show off for all he's worth
Posing every second
And someone of these nights
There'll be a crowd around him
Enjoying themselves
At him in the tub
With no authorities looking on
That's the kind that get it.
* * *
And to kid the kidders I'm gonna wear a "creation"
on Rough's Day designed by Delia Patra, a post-im
pressionistic conception of "Cabbages on Thursday."
The purple sails of Cleopatra will look like iodine along
side of the Joseph cloak of many colors Thursday will
array himself in.
• • *
"I've had thirty hours added to my graduation re
quirements."
"Wonderful, old man, where'd you get the stuff?"
* m *
If the frosh are wise they'll rake up everything around
the campus that could possibly be used for a paddle
and chuck it on the pile for the big blaze next week. If
they succeed, there'll be absolutely no economic want
for corrugated hickory hereafter. They will have beaten
the Washington conference on the disarmament propo
sition.
• • •
At the same time, they better lay off the bonfire to
morrow afternoon and hie themselves to Berkeley,
where a five-week old frosh team on foreign soil meets
an eleven-week old. That team, plus Stanford fight,
can win. And that's no cabbage either.
♦ * *
Ever read "Stanford Stories" by Irwin and Field?
They say, be loyal to Stanford, even by silence when
it were disloyal to speak. Some fellow who must have
read that said the other day he imagined it would be
disloyal for a Stanford man to win the $25 Roos offer
for the correct score of the big game... "No," snapped
another, "It wouldn't be disloyal to figure the game as
you do, it'd be just unprofitable."
♦ ♦ *
Atta, old fight. Jack at the head of the team, Jack
behind it.
* ♦ ♦
"Why are they hollering "Shift-key, shift-key' all the
time?"
"So the other tackle, Dole, will know what's going
on. He's the Spaceband. There's going to be a Capital
gain."

I KNEAD THEE EVERY HOUR—Sung by the baker

Dear Head of Cabbage:—Please tell Carl and Hal
they can't josh me out tof writing co-ed ditties because
I don't discuss what our better fifth wears or other such
stuff that even Chappie has come to ban. I rather pre
fer humor so tainted with philosophy that even mem
bers of the Faculty will read the Cabbage Colyum. For
instance, the following attempt:
* * *
There's a little Frosh
Co-ed
On this campus
Who likes to gather some admirers
Of the opposite sex
Around her
In front of the class-room
Or library, or law steps, or any old place
Where crowds be
And show off for all she's worth
Posing every second
And some one of these nights
There'll be a crowd around her
Enjoying themselves
On the ballroom floor
While the wall-flowers look on
That's the kind that get them.
There's a little Frosh
Gent
On this campus
Who likes to gather some admirers
Of the opposite sex *
Around him
In front of the class-room
Or library, or law steps, or any old place
Where crowds be
And show off for all he's worth
Posing every second
And someone of these nights
There'll be a crowd around him
Enjoying themselves
At him in the tub
With no authorities looking on
That's the kind that get it.
* * *
And to kid the kidders I'm gonna wear a "creation"
on Rough's Day designed by Delia Patra, a post-im
pressionistic conception of "Cabbages on Thursday."
The purple sails of Cleopatra will look like iodine along
side of the Joseph cloak of many colors Thursday will
array himself in.
• • *
"I've had thirty hours added to my graduation re
quirements."
"Wonderful, old man, where'd you get the stuff?"
* m *
If the frosh are wise they'll rake up everything around
the campus that could possibly be used for a paddle
and chuck it on the pile for the big blaze next week. If
they succeed, there'll be absolutely no economic want
for corrugated hickory hereafter. They will have beaten
the Washington conference on the disarmament propo
sition.
• • •
At the same time, they better lay off the bonfire to
morrow afternoon and hie themselves to Berkeley,
where a five-week old frosh team on foreign soil meets
an eleven-week old. That team, plus Stanford fight,
can win. And that's no cabbage either.
♦ * *
Ever read "Stanford Stories" by Irwin and Field?
They say, be loyal to Stanford, even by silence when
it were disloyal to speak. Some fellow who must have
read that said the other day he imagined it would be
disloyal for a Stanford man to win the $25 Roos offer
for the correct score of the big game... "No," snapped
another, "It wouldn't be disloyal to figure the game as
you do, it'd be just unprofitable."
