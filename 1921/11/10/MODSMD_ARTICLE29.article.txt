# "CO-OPERATION IS FACT"-MISS YOST

### Leona Mayer, '23 
"Faculty-student co-operation is be
coming an accomplished fact. Swinging
from one extreme of faculty domination,
to the other of faculty disinterest, true
co-operation is the end toward which
we have been gradually
In these words Miss Mary Yost, Dean
of Women of Stanford University,
sounded the keynote of the joint session
of the* Deans of Women and Student
Conference held in P>erkeley yesterday.
The joint session, giving as it did, an
opportunity for the expression of both
faculty and student viewpoint, led to a
more thorough appreciation of the diffi
culties confronting each group in its
efforts to approach the other. Certain
dominant facts stood out from the dis
cussion as the high lights which would
lead to a solution of the time-honored
problem. That it must be the aim of
the students to force the faculty to a
realization of their earnest purpose in
the universities, that the faculty must
encourage this purpose, and that as ad
niinistrators they must make their share
of the advances; these were the salient
points of the students' view. On the
other side, Miss Ethel Caldwell, Dean
of Pomona College, impressed upon the
conference the necessity of a greater
willingness on the part of students to
accept mature guidance and advice. "It
is only with faculty assistance that the
student body can maintain a government
which will stand up both as an academic
institution and an example which can
withstand the inspection of public
opinion," she said.
A different method of approach to the
question was again suggested by Miss
Yost. It was her idea that only when
faculty and students would ride on the
common ground of mutual interest in
some working project, could we arrive
at true unity of spirit. Disarmament
conferences in the various universities
she cited as an example of a problem,
which, when dealt with in open forums
of students and faculty, would offer an
opportunity for such co-operation.
"Women's Participation in Campus
Elections" was the topic of the afternoon
session, for which the women's confer
ence again met alone, while the deans
went on a visit of inspection to the
Mills College dormitories. Through the
mass of difficulties presented by the
various delegates as representing the sit
uation on their respective campuses, one
sentiment was paramount. It was that
the women must and do stand for an
active participation in clean politics.
No general remedy could be offered
for tiie almost inevitable split between
"Greek" and "Independent" groups on
every campus, but it was suggested that
stronger men's and women's organiza
tions would tend to bridge over 1 the ex
isting gulf.
A discussion of ways and means of
financing A. W. S. organization con
cluded the conference for the day. In
the evening the delegates were enter
tained by the California A. W. S. at a
conference banquet held at the Clare
mont Country Club.
Tomorrow will conclude the week's
program with a consideration of "The
Need for an International Viewpoint,"
the heart of the discussion to center on
the Disarmament Conference and the
â€¢coming European Students' Relief
Drive.
