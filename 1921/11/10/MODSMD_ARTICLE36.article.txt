# STANFORD GRADUATE ESTABLISHES LOAN FUND FOR STUDENTS
## 
### 
Mrs. Sadie Bernham Patek, '11, has
established a loan fund of $10,1)00 for
medical students, in memory of her hus
band, the late Dr. Robert Patek of San
Francisco.
This fund, principal and interest, is to
be loaned to medical students to assist
them in completing their medical course.
A student who has once received a loan
from the fund is entitled to continue to
get additional loans until his graduation.
The loans granted to students are to bear
no interest for six years and then to
have an interest rate of 6 per cent until
paid. Applications for loans are to be
made through the President's office.
