# Nominations Must Be In By Monday Noon To Fill Vacancies In the Student Body Offices
## 
### 
Nominations for the two vacancies in
the student body list must be in by Mon
day noon. The box for receiving the
names will be on the window ledge near
the Law steps. The two vacancies to be
filled are made by the withdrawal of
James Davies, '22, from the Executive
Committee, and Morris Kirksey from
the Board of Athletic Control. Any
senior is eligible to fill the place made
vacant by either of these men, and hold
overs are eligible for that made vacant
by Kirksey's withdrawal.
The nominations will be closed at
noon, Monday, and then run in the Daily
of Monday night. They must be signed
by the person making the nomination.
Tuesday night's Daily will have the list
of withdrawals, and the final list of
names to be voted upon for the two
offices.
The election will be at the customary
place near the Law steps, and will be
held from 11 until 2 on Wednesday.
