Newspapers dating back to 1797 have
been donated to the Pioneer Room of the
Museum by Mrs. Ida S. Oldroyd, who
is curator in the Mineralogy Department.
Part of the collection of the journals has
been given by Sergeant John F. Kreps.
The case contains a New York Herald
announcing the assination of President
Abraham Lincoln, and copies of the San
Francisco Examiner published as early
as 1866.
