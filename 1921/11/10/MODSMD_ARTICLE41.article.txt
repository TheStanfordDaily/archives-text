## 
### 
With fifteen seconds left to play, Ma
jor Collins if the Red polo team carried
the ball half the length of the field and
put over a goal, taking yesterday's match
from the Browns, 6-5. The score was
made just before the gong sounded on
an extra period being played to decide
the contest. The Reds had previously
overcome their handicap of five, but were
held even from then to the end of the
regulation two periods. A shift in the
Red lineup, placing Collins on the of
fcues at No. 3 position, gave him the
opportunity to score. Captain Richard
son starred at defense for the losers.
Richardson had two new men, Worden
and Drysdale, on his squad of Brown
riders, who played well.
In the second mutch, the White team
lost to the Blues 4-1, by erratic team
play, ihe White players, who appear
individually superior to any of the
others, have not yet learned to co
ordinate their skill, with the result that
they only registered one safety toward
overcoming their four handicap. Several
pretty runs were made by Talbert and
Vandeberg of the Whites, but there was
no one to back them up.
Both games yesterday were faster as
a result of scraping the field, which had
cracked badly in the heat.
New handicaps were allotted this
week, compiled from the results of the
first series, ihe Whites were given 7,
the Reds 5, the Blues 3, and the Browns
0. An extra handicap of two points was
given the Reds in their overtime period
against the Browns.
Arrangements have been completed
for indoor polo to be played in the saw
dust of the riding- school when winter
rains set in. The playing area will be
forty by eighty yards. The inside game
is the same except that a pneumatic ball
the size of an indoor baseball is used.
