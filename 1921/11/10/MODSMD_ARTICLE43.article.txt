# FRESHMEN SOCCER ELEVEN WILL MEET CALIFORNIA BABES
## 
### 
Stanford's freshmen soccerites will
journey to Berkeley tomorrow to play
the first of their scheduled games with
the California first-year eleven. Fifteen
men will comprise the squad that will
make the trip, and in all probabilities
all of them will get a chance to mix
with the foe. The game starts at 1
o'clock and is a preliminary contest to
the Stanford-California freshmen foot
ball game.
The Babe team which Harry Maloney
is sending to Berkeley this season seems
to be one of the strongest freshmen
soccer teams that Stanford has ever
turned out. In the regular evening
scrimmages the freshmen have been
showing up well against the varsity.
Last Saturday, in a practice game, the
frosh sent the second varsity down to
defeat.
Although the freshmen forwards are
a little erratic at times, the line men as
a whole have developed into a smooth
and cooperative scoring machine. The
men are good at shooting goals.
The men going to Berkeley are:
Hayes, gg; Mesa, rf; Turquand, If;
Cannon, rh; Baugh (captain) ch; Off,
lh; Hall, or; Hoover, ir; Toam, cf;
Quigley, il; Carey, 01.
