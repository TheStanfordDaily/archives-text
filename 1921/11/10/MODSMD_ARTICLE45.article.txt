# LILLY'S MEN LOSE FIRST CONTEST TO WARREN GRID TEAM
## 
### 
Coach Ken Lilly's 135-pound football
men lost their first game last night to
the William Warren School eleven of
Menlo Park by a score of 7 to 6. A
failure to kick goal by Stanford pre
vented a tie. Lilly used the contest as
an opportunity to try his entire squad
in a real game, two teams being sent
into the play. The game was full of
thrills for the prep school crowd, Stan
ford holding for downs within the eight
yard line three different times. Lack of
teamwork on the part of the Cardinal
lightweight men was largely responsible
for their inability to do more scoring,
although the Warren team has been play
ing all season and had a weight ad
vantage of about ten pounds per man.
Stanford's touchdown was put over in
the first three minutes of play, Warren
received the kick-off and was forced to
punt. The 135-pound men showed a
flash of ground-gaining ability by taking
the ball down the field for fifty yards on
a series of line-bucks and forward
passes. Left Half Phelps carried the
ball over the line. Warren opened up
and repeated Stanford's feat a few min
utes later. One split buck netted a
thirty-yard gain, and forward passes
brought the pigskin under the Stanford
goal posts. Fullback Bradshaw went
over for the score. The goal kick gave
Warren the lead. An outstanding fea
ture of the game was the completion by
both sides of many forward passes.
There were no particular stars on the
Stanford squad, while the Warren backs,
Bradshaw and Berg, scintillated.
For first part of the third quarter,
Stanford had the edge in playing, but
lost it permanently thereafter. After
working the ball to the ten-yard line,
Warren backs failed to make downs, and
the Cardinal fullback, McAllister, punted
out thirty-five yards. Twice again the
cadet players reached the ten-yard terri
tory only to lose the ball on downs.
The Stanford line was weak on the de
fense, but on these three occasions at
least showed evidence of plenty of tight.
Lilly's proteges will meet the Potter
High eleven of San Francisco Saturday
morning at 10:30 on the freshman field.
