## 
### 
The final coat of plaster is being put
on the towers of the new Union building.
The brown sandstone tint of the quad
buildings is being used, and it is hoped
that when the new building is completed
the Women's Clubhouse and old Union
will be gone over in the same shade, thus
making the square a uniform color in
harmony with the prevailing color
scheme.
An attempt will be made to complete
tinting the facade in time for the Big
