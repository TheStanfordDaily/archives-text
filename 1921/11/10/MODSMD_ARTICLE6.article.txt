# "Freedom of the Press" Holds Big Place in Chappie Production
## 
### 
Among the ten big acts which will be
featured in the Chappie Football Show
the night of the Big Game in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall, is one written by
Harry Borba, editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, and entitled "The Freedom of the
Press."
It deals with the trials and tribulations
of an editor of a college newspaper and
his staff of news editors, reporters, and
office boys. The scene is laid in a typical
press office, and the action takes place
amid the rattle of numerous typewriters
and the frantic calls of "Copy" by the
exasperated man on the desk.
First of all, the editor bustles in after
a bad night's sleep and a still worse
breakfast, and the office force cringe and
secrete themselves in all the nooks and
crannies of the very bare room. Then
comes the daily bawl-out issued by the
editor direct to the members of the staff.
After this pleasant duty is performed,
the editor bounces out to his private
editorial chambers to sleep until the
dinner bell rings.
The routine of the day begins. Hora
tio, the Freshman reporter, is sent out
to get a story on the Stadium, and re
turns triumphant, with a long disserta

tion from the Classical Languages de
partment on "Ancient Greek and Roman
Stadii." The news editor goes into hys
terics, but is revived by a shot of Carter's
ink in the arm.
This equinoxial storm is successfully
weathered, but more dark clouds loom
on the horizon. An athlete storms in to
find the reason why he has been fcom
pared to a Loon in the "Lettuce" column.
The cub reporter attempts to remon
strate with the handsome brute, but
doesn't get very far. When he comes
to, he is just passing over La Honda,
headed in the general direction of the
sea.
Next, a burly engineer appears upon
the scene to plead for an editorial upon
campus innovations and reforms—par
ticularly, the installation of electric fans
at convenient locations about the Engi
neering corner. But the climax of the
act is reached when Miss Co-ed, a
would-be try-outee, comes in and begins
a regeneration of the office and all the
office force. How she accomplishes this
task, is deliciously told in the remainder
of the act. After seeing this sketch, the
directors believe the audience will ap
preciate why reporters and editors arc
wild-eyed and haggard.
