# LYNCH DISCUSSES ARMS QUESTION
## Business Looks Forward to Success of Conference With Eagerness, Says S. F. Man 
### 
"The world faces certain ruination
unless there is something done about
the armament burden," declared R. N.
Lynch, vice-president of the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce, in his
talk last evening, in the Little The
atre, on "American Business and the
Conference for the Limitation of
Arms," given under the auspices of
the World Problems Forum, of the
local Y. M. C. A.
"The economic argument (for dis
armament) is compelling," he stated,
and went on to give comparative sta
tistics on the amount spent for the
machines of war. "Fifty million dol
lars, the first appropriation for the
Spanish-American War, staggered the
country," he said, "but now, one
battleship costs almost that much. It
has been estimated that " for every
battleship we build, we could build
and operate another Stanford Uni
versity."
Lynch declared that although Presi
dent Harding has evidently called this
conference with the idea that each na
tion will come in good faith, we must
insist on practical co-operation before
taking the lead in disarmament. The
United States, he said .should not sud
denly, and alone, scrap all of its ships
and leave itself very weak and open
to attack; for "our civilization is well
worth defense."
"I am not sure that this conference
will be guided by pure idealism,"
Lynch went on to say, explaining that
it is almost too much to expect, where
results, if gotten, must be had through
straightforward, practical dealing.
France, with her ever-present fear of
a reviyed Germany, wants to protect
herself, even at the cost of a tremend
ous land armament burden which she
is now bearing..
Lynch said that American business
is looking forward with eagerness to
ward the hope of a successful confer
ence. The Chamber of Commerce in
San Francisco sent a document con
cerning the coming conference to
other similar bodies throughout the
country, and reports from everywhere
show that the business world of the
whole nation is deeply concerned over
what the outcome of the disarmament
conference may be.
