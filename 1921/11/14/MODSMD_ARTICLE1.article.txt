# UNDERCLASS TEAMS TIE IN MILLS GAME; MILLS SENIORS WIN
## Fast Play, Teamwork Mark Work of the. Day; Carey Bailard Stars for Seniors 
### 
Fast play and excellent teamwork
served to mount scores when the Stan
ford women's sophomore hockey team
held the Mills College freshmen to a tie
and the Mills upperclass squad won the
match with the Stanford seniors Satur
day morning on the Mills field. Players
on the Stanford teams had to accustom
themselves to the uneven surface of the
field, cutting down 011 dribbling and tak
ing greater care in receiving balls.
Time after time the Stanford seniors
attempted goals within the circle but
were caught by the Mills goaler and
fullbacks. Carrie Bailard played a con
sistently steady game, making spectacu
lar steals from the defense and shooting
true to the wings. The opposing team
showed some of its swift work when
Elizabeth Coflfeen, left wing, shot a goal
in the first five minutes. Stanford got
the ball and started for, the opposite
circle but was intercepted before a shot
could be made. Ruth Palmer, center
forward, made two points by shooting
swiftly and accurately. Elja Miller made
a fine long run dribbling the ball down
the right side of the field almost to the
Mills goaler, but the strong defense
stole it and another score was shot,
making a 4 to 0 tally at the end of the
first half.
The second half showed a fine play
011 tlTe part of the Stanford defense.
Margaret Younglove and Norma Win
good, fullbacks, reliable in stop
ping shots at the goal. Numerous free
hits \*cre called for "sticks" and lofting
the ball throughout the half. Mills suc
ceeded in scoring a goal. A moment of
suspense was that when Carey Bailard
left the field with an injured finger. She
returned immediately and played her
usual fast, accurate game to the finish.
The final score was 5-0 in Mills' favor.
The underclass game began fine for
Stanford when Grace Strobel made a
goal a few minutes after the starting
whistle. Mills took the ball and Mildred
Weskott, right wing, completed the
drive down field by shooting it past the
Stanford goaler. Excellent teamwork
gave Stanford'two more points. Ihe
halves played a conspicuously steady
game. Mills made the last score in the
second half when Emily Searles drib
bled the shot true. Stanford prevented
another goal when Ellowene Delahoyde,
fulback, used an effective reverse stroke,
shooting the ball clear of the Gold
and White women.
Mills shot two goals at the beginning
of the second half, making fast runs,
shooting sure passes. The Cardinal
women then tied the score, 4-4. Con
stance Tamplin made a spectacular run
but failed to get the ball over the goal.
Ruth Jameson played a consistent game
for Stanford, making two goals out of
the four. Constance Tamplin was a
strong 'inside player and made the third
point. Neither team could sway the tie
before time was called.
