# FRESHMAN SOCCER ELEVEN WINS FROM CALIFORNIA TEAM
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's freshman
soccer team won its first game with
the California yearlings Friday on the
Berkeley field by a score of 2 to 0.
The game was featured by exceeding
ly good teamwork on the part of the
Cardinal men, and although the Cali
fornia eleven showed bursts of speed
and co-operation, it could not compete
with the steady working red-shirted
players.
T'aam, a lad from Canton, China,
did the scoring for the Cardinals. He
was, however, ably backed by the rest
of the forwards, and it was through
work with them that he was able to
score. Carey and Quigley both kept
the Cardinal backfield on the defense
by th\r long shots. Many of their
shots were close, and the California
men had to mark them.
Captain Ray Baugh made his pres
ence known to the California fresh
men by his work in the center half
position. Baugh was a tower of
Strength for his team,
The men who went to Berkeley are:
Hays gg, Mesa rf, Turquand If, Cannon
rh, Baugh (Captain) ch, Off lh, Hall
or. Hoover ir, T'aam cf, Quigley il,
Carey oi.
