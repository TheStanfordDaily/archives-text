# JOHN G. NEIHARDT TO LECTURE ON POETRY
## 
### 
John G. Neihardt will lecture in the
Little Theater tomorrow night at 7:30
on "Poetry and Education." He is the
author of many volumes of poetry and
a contributor of verse and fiction to
magazines. Last spring the Nebraska
legislature gave him the title of Poet
Laureate of Nebraska, the first time
an American law-body has officially rec
ognized an American poet.
Two poems of the epic cycle which
Neihardt is creating have already been
published. They are "The Song of Hugh
Glass" and "The Song of Three Friends,"
the latter of which won the prize for
the best volume of verse published by
an American during the year 1919. A
school edition of "The Song of Hugh
Glass" has been published with anno
tations by Dr. Julius T. House and is
studied as a classic in many schools.
Neihardt is now engaged in writing the
third piece of the cycle. It is called
"The Song of the Indian Wars."
Neihardt is considered to have dev
veloped the national epic more than any
other modern poet. He puts into his
works a spirit of courage and hardiness
which the American pioneers had when
they kept pushing westward, exploring
and opening up new sections of America.
