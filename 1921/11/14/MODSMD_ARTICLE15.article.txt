# BEAR CUBS BLOCK PUNT AND WIN GRID LAURELS
## Stanford Freshmen Outclass Enemy First Three Quarters but Lose Out 21 to 28 as Berkeley Makes Fight 
### C. H. PRIOR, '23 
Outplaying the California Freshmen in every department of play, Coach
Seay's Babes took the bitter dose of a 28-to 21 defeat on the Berkeley turf
Friday afternoon, when the blocking of a punt robbed them of the victory
which three-quarters of play had assured them.
It was a hard pill to swallow. For three quarters the Blue and Gold Cubs
were helpless and the Babes romped through the line for gain after gain.
Then Coach Seay was forced to gradually replace most of his men, destroying
the smoothness of his machine which had been doing such beautiful work.
This turned the tide of battle and when Cayot blocked Cuddeback's punt in the
last four minutes of play and fell on it behind the goal pests, the victdry of
Seay's warriors slipped away.
Spalding was the star of the game, carrying the ball time after time for sub
stantial gains until it seemed that this man of iron must drop in his tracks from

sheer exhaustion. California had no
other man who stood out with any
brilliance, while at least a half dozen
of the Card Babes did work which
marked them as the types of varsity
material who will make the Bruins fight
harder tfcan ever for their laurels in the
next three years.
In the Stanford backfield, Captain
Dennis and Cuddeback stood out as the
bulwarks of strength, with Gilliland
getting in some speedy work which up
season of a future varsity gridder. In
the line Shipke, Dole, and Janssen did
work which should place their names
on the roster of events.
The game started before a crowd of
10,000 fans, and on the very first play
Spalding got away around the end, run
ning thirty-nine yards for a touchdown.
Horrell kicked the goal.
Cardinal fans swallowed hard and
felt that peculiar cold-water effect.
Things were not starting off just right.
Following a fifteen-yard penalty which
took them back to their fifteen-yard
line, the ,Bruins punted a meager fif
teen yard's. On the Ihird play, Cudde
back bucked through tackle and ran
thirty-seven yards through a broken
field for a touchdown. Dennis kicked
goal.
Card fans laughed in relief, and the
hope thermometer registered high
again.
But it registered still higher when
the Cardinal offensive started its march
down the field for a sixty-yard journey
and a touchdown. Cuddeback made the
most gains and it was he who finally
carried over. Dennis kicked the goal.
Toward the end of the first quarter
and after several exchanges of punts,
Stanford had the ball on the Cubs'
forty-three-yard line. Cuddback at
tempted a pass and there was no one
on the job to receive it. Dennis at
tempted a second and Gilliland caught
it high above his head, but before he
could get it down to tuck it under his
arm Dixon, Bruin halfback, pulled it
from his grasp and ran it back five
yards before he was nailed. The referee
declared in favor of Dixon. With an
exchange of punts the quarter ended,
California in possession of the ball on
their own thirty-five-yard line.
Seay's yearling repeated their first
sixty-yard offenisve in the second quar
ter. Dennis, Cuddeback, and Gilliland
carried for long gains, and three out
of four forward passes were successful.
On the first pass, the Bruin line got
through and Dennis did not have time to
pick his target The second one was the
most thrilling play of the game. Dennis
passed fifteen yards to Janssen and for
several agonizing seconds the hall bal
anced in the stalwart end's left hand, and
he finally secured his grasp, making to
the fifteen-yard line.
The third was Dennis to Wittenberg
for five yards, and the final one, Cudde
back to Janssen for the third touchdown.
Dennis kicked the goal.
California came back hard and, start
ing on the Cardinal thirty-five-yard line,
completed its offensive for a touchdown.
Spalding and Terry made from five to
seven yards consistently, the latter carry
ing over the line. Horrell kicked the
goal.
Hard fighting featured the third quar
ter, with Stanford holding the edge until
the last few minutes, when the Cubs
pushed consistently down the field and
were at the five-yard line when the gun
fired.
Seay's men proved their worth by
holding the plunging Cubs for downs,
and Cuddeback punted to the forty-yard
line.
Not to be stopped, Sprott's fighters
came right down the field again and were
on the fifteen-yard line when Cuddeback
intercepted Terry's pass and ran it back
to the twenty-nine-yard line.
Right at this point, Gilliland and the
referee contributed to the loss of the ball
for the Cards. Gilliland fumbled and
two Stanford men and one Bruin were
on it when the pile of legs and arms un
tangled. The ball was given to Cali
fornia
Spalding, Terry, and King carried
down the field for the tying touchdown,
Spalding diving over the line for the
final yards. Horrell kicked the goal.
On the final touchdown, Spalding
punted to the Cardinal fourteen-yard line
and, when Cuddeback attempted to kick
out of danger, Cayot broke through the
line, blocked the kick and fell on it for
the fatal touchdown. Horrell kicked the
goal.
