# BEAR CUBS BLOCK PUNT AND WIN GRID LAURELS
## Stanford Freshmen Outclass Enemy First Three Quarters but Lose Out 21 to 28 as Berkeley Makes Fight 
### C. H. PRIOR, '23 
Outplaying the California Freshmen in every department of play, Coach
Seay's Babes took the bitter dose of a 28-to 21 defeat on the Berkeley turf
Friday afternoon, when the blocking of a punt robbed them of the victory
which three-quarters of play had assured them.
It was a hard pill to swallow. For three quarters the Blue and Gold Cubs
were helpless and the Babes romped through the line for gain after gain.
Then Coach Seay was forced to gradually replace most of his men, destroying
the smoothness of his machine which had been doing such beautiful work.
This turned the tide of battle and when Cayot blocked Cuddeback's punt in the
last four minutes of play and fell on it behind the goal pests, the victdry of
Seay's warriors slipped away.
Spalding was the star of the game, carrying the ball time after time for sub
stantial gains until it seemed that this man of iron must drop in his tracks from

sheer exhaustion. California had no
other man who stood out with any
brilliance, while at least a half dozen
of the Card Babes did work which
marked them as the types of varsity
material who will make the Bruins fight
harder tfcan ever for their laurels in the
next three years.
In the Stanford backfield, Captain
Dennis and Cuddeback stood out as the
bulwarks of strength, with Gilliland
getting in some speedy work which up
season of a future varsity gridder. In
the line Shipke, Dole, and Janssen did
work which should place their names
on the roster of events.
The game started before a crowd of
10,000 fans, and on the very first play
Spalding got away around the end, run
ning thirty-nine yards for a touchdown.
Horrell kicked the goal.
Cardinal fans swallowed hard and
felt that peculiar cold-water effect.
Things were not starting off just right.
Following a fifteen-yard penalty which
took them back to their fifteen-yard
line, the ,Bruins punted a meager fif
teen yard's. On the Ihird play, Cudde
back bucked through tackle and ran
thirty-seven yards through a broken
field for a touchdown. Dennis kicked
goal.
Card fans laughed in relief, and the
hope thermometer registered high
again.
But it registered still higher when
the Cardinal offensive started its march
down the field for a sixty-yard journey
and a touchdown. Cuddeback made the
most gains and it was he who finally
carried over. Dennis kicked the goal.
Toward the end of the first quarter
and after several exchanges of punts,
Stanford had the ball on the Cubs'
forty-three-yard line. Cuddback at
tempted a pass and there was no one
on the job to receive it. Dennis at
tempted a second and Gilliland caught
it high above his head, but before he
could get it down to tuck it under his
arm Dixon, Bruin halfback, pulled it
from his grasp and ran it back five
yards before he was nailed. The referee
declared in favor of Dixon. With an
exchange of punts the quarter ended,
California in possession of the ball on
