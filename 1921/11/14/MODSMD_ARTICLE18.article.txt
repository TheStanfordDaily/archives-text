# The 						Day of the Rough.
## 
### 
Old clothes which the "ole does" man failed to
get on his last trip around the campus will be called
back into use and the moans of the barbers will have
reached their highest heights when Stanford men
array themselves for Rough's Day and go forth
upon the campus unshaven and unshorn on next
Wednesday.
The celebration of Rough's Day is an old and
cherished Stanford custom. Every year during the
week preceding the Big Game the v men of Stanford
dress in old clothes put on to make them appear
peculiar, grotesque, or comical. Faces are left un
shaved for two or thre days preceding the celebra
tion, and the famed Stanford engineers lose their
identities for one whole twenty-four-hour period
while the entire male portion of the student body
makes revel. And woe be unto the gent who appears
with a white collar and tie around his neck. His
shall be the course of the wild and untamed until he
is run down and forced to shed his every-other-but
rough-day raiment.
The committee in charge of Rough's Day has
planned to make this the greatest ever staged on the
campus. Three groups will compete for the honor
of being the most humorous or most ridiculous. The
divisions are the crowd at the Economics steps, the
Law majors, and the hardy engineers. Rival shows
will be held between classes and the final great com
petition of the day will take place in the stadium at
four o'clock in the afternoon.
Stanford students will enter the new stadium as a
body for the first time on Wednesday afternoon.
1 he rival contingents of roughs will parade around
the track and pass before the women, who will sit
as a reviewing body in the bleachers. .After the
show is over Veil Leader Connolly and his two
assistants will take charge of the assemblage and
a mammoth song and yell rally will be staged.
There are two things to be guarded against if
Rough's Day is to be made a complete success. On
the one hand there is the tendency to minimize the
importance of the celebration as a real spirit builder
and to leave its observance to a small group. On the
other there is danger of overdoing the stunts and of
becoming too vulgar in the matter of costumes and
.shows.
Everyone should throw himself into the spirit of
the occasion. Its effect in unifying the student body
-cannot be overestimated. A little thought on the part
•of each individual rough will prevent any semblance
>of vulgarity or risqueness from creeping in.
The presence of Stanford's five hundred women
as a reviewing body at the culmination of the cele
bration in the stadium will make it an all-University
affair.

There are two things to be guarded against if
Rough's Day is to be made a complete success. On
the one hand there is the tendency to minimize the
importance of the celebration as a real spirit builder
and to leave its observance to a small group. On the
other there is danger of overdoing the stunts and of
becoming too vulgar in the matter of costumes and
.shows.
Everyone should throw himself into the spirit of
the occasion. Its effect in unifying the student body
-cannot be overestimated. A little thought on the part
•of each individual rough will prevent any semblance
>of vulgarity or risqueness from creeping in.
The presence of Stanford's five hundred women
as a reviewing body at the culmination of the cele
bration in the stadium will make it an all-University
affair.
