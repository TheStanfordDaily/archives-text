# Spontaneous Shouting.
## 
### 
The score is 14 to 7 with the Cardinal eleven in the
lead. The rival quarterback received a short pass
and falls over the goal line just as he is tackled, tieing
the score. From the visiting group of two hundred
students across the field come shouts of joy and
exultation along with words of encouragement to the
men in the white striped blue jerseys. From the
Stanford section comes never a word of encourage
ment nor an indication of fight. Still the section is
filled to overflowing and everyone present feels the
fighting impulse.
Why then the silence? The reason is the Yell
Leader. The quarterback barks signals and the Yell
Leader raises his arms for silence, while across the
field the Nevada rooters are chattering away without
bothering apparently the teams in action upon the
field.
It becomes more and more apparent that freedom
of the bleachers is the thing to be desired. The fine
part of football for the spectator is in being able to

root. When the Yell Leader motions for silence he
means silence in concerted rooting and not on the
part of the individual. Concerted rooting is what
bothers the teams in hearing signals. Evidences of
individual spirit that are manifested in bleacher
patter should not be stifled.
Stanford students have come to regard the Yell
Leader as a sort of traffic cop, who says,stop and
they stop, and he says yell and they yell. They have
come to depend entirely upon directions of the leader
and there is a decided absence of spontaneous rooting
on the part of everyone.
Judgment in starting the yells is exercised by those
in charge and once a yell is started it should never be
stopped until it is finished, but there should be no
ban on the amount of individual shouting.
