# SPORTSMANSHIP
## 
### 
<§> Last year, when the game <$>
<§> was held at Berkeley, the end <$>
<«> of the day was marked /by
<$> many evidences of poor sports- <$>
<$> manship. There was a ten- <§>
<J> dency shown to regard the root- <$>
<$> ers' hats of both sides as tro- <$>
<$>phies of war, and this led to a <S>
<$> situation which excited much <$>
<$> unfavorable comment. <S>
<$> This year we are the hosts <$>
<«> and as such will be judged by <$>
some sixty thousand people, and
<$> the press of the West. Such 4>
<$> acts hat-snatching, jeering, <$>
<$> taunting, and so forth, are dis- <§>
<?> tinctly unsportsmanlike, un- <$>
Stanfordlike, and therefore •$>
<§> must not be indulged in. They <$>
<?> besmirch a clean victory and <$>
<8» dishonor an honorable defeat. <§>
•*•> We have our own standard to <$>
<§> live up to; we must not deter- <$>
mine our conduct by the actions <$>
<$> of others. <$>
