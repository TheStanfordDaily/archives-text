We'd like to pull a Bradshaw and slip out of the way
today, but Cabbages must grow even on Blue Mondays.
We're about as full of humor today as the icy shores
of Greenland are of sunstrokes.

Now that the weekly kick is registered, we'll attempt
to convert and see if you can get the'.point.
Speaking of Bradshaw, however, we predict a success
ful business future for him. Even his creditors won't
be able to catch him when he wants to leave for some
where in a hurry.

Those Indian heads on the Varsity blankets look quite
the thing. Gumshoe Gup remarks they ought to help
them buck the line, but we decided not to print the re
mark. Why not a similar blanket, with a papoose de
sign, for the freshmen teams?

Not to be behind times, Cabbages has instituted a spe

as the Kabbage Intercollegiate News Mangling Associa
tion. The names of the other members are secret, by
request. Some of the latest dispatches follow:

day.—All freshmen, by the latest rules, must wear green
shoestrings, and must not be seen on the steps of the
Home Cooking Building between the hours of 4 and 6

of this rule will be given a mean look.

EXTRA TO K. 1. N. M. A.
San Quentin College.—"The boys are observing the
new social probation rule nicely," said Warden Hack
today to our very special interviewer. "They voted on
whether we should allow them to go out Wednesday
nights or not. A majority was in favor, but they still
stay in."

FLASH TO K. I. N. M. A.
Mexico College No. 1, November 45768, 1921. —"Cer-
tainly not!" declared Dean Krumbles here today when
asked if he brushed his pants off every morning after
breakfast. "I do not believe it consistent with the prin
ciples of international peace," was his pithy comment.

Somebody named "Ben B. Bandoline" sent us in a
joke. At least, he called it that. We have sent it to the
Bureau of Standards at Washington to have it analyzed

WE SUGGEST FOR THE ENGINEERS' MOTTO: "IT'S
AN ILL WIND," ETC.
