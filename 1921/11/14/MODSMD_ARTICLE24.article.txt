# THIRTY-TWO TEAMS TO START OPEN DOUBLES TOURNEY TOMORROW
## 
### 
Thirty-two teams will start play to
morrow in the annual open doubles ten
nis tournament. This tournament will
be used to a considerable extent as a
basis for ranking the doubles teams as
to varsity standing. The winning team
will be awarded a prize to be selected
soon. Several strong combinations liave
entered, and it is expected that the play
ing will bring out some good court team
work. A small entry fee will be charged
to cover the cost of tennis balls.
One of the best combinations is that
of Hinckley and Mertz, first and second
men on last year's freshman team which
defeated California in four out of five
matches. Tussing and Deßach promise
to show an equally good brand of net
work. Tussing was a member of the
varsity in 1919, and Deßach was on the
'24 freshman squad. Phil Neer and Dar
ling, "Skee" Turner and partner, J. Neer
and Burkhard all form dangerous con
tenders »for the title. There are other
teams which have possibilities for show
ing up exceptionally well.
The drawings and matches scheduled
are as follows: Tuesday at 4 p. m., Feb
ren and Strauss vs. Cavenaugh and Def
fenbach; Leeds and partner vs. Booth
and Hawkins; Deßach and Tussing vs.
Williard and partner; Holliway and
partner vs. Edwards and Brown; Wol
ford and Bundy vs. Aydellott and Foye;
Allen and Webster vs. Dußois and Biele
feldt; Farley and partner vs. Kitow and
Mizota; Copeland and Copeland vs.
