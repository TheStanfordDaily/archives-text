# SYMPHONY CONCERTS TO BE GIVEN LATER BY NOTED ORCHESTRA
## 
### 
The Stanford Symphony Committee
has just issued a statement of the finan
cial standing of the organization through
the chairman of the committee, Profes
sor A. C. Whitaker.
During the season of 1920-21, this
committee presented the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra in two concerts,
in addition to a joint recital with the
Stanford Glee Club under Warren D.
Allen. From this initial venture, a sur
plus of $480 was realized. They pro
pose to sponsor a second series of con
certs this winter by the same orchestra,
provided that they can secure sufficient
guarantees of financial backing from the
friends of music in this community. The
committee wishes it distinctly under
stood that there is no private profit
made in connection with their work.
The probable dates of these proposed
concerts will be November 29th and
January 10th. Admission (except for
certain of the poorest seats) will be $2
a person for two concerts, $1.50 for a
single concert.
