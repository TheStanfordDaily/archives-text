# CARD-SAGEHEN DRAW RESULTS FROM GAME STARRING BRADSHAW
## Varsity Gridmen are Unable to Solve Nevada's Attack; Patrick Makes Half of Total Yards for Cardinal 
### E. C. WEST, '23 
Nevada University fought Stanford to
a 14-to-14 tie Saturday afternoon in a
game that marked the last to be played
on the present Stanford turf. â€¢
Nevada tied Stanford because it had
"Rabbit" Bradshaw, the fastest thing in
a football suit in the West, and because
the Cards seemed unable to break up
the plays in which he participated.
Bradshaw was easily the star of the
game. It was nothing new to him. He
has been starring ever since he entered
the Reno institution four years ago. He
was simply going good Saturday.
But Stanford should have stopped him
several times when he scampered around
the ends for long gains. Van Gent's
team, minus several men who undoubt
edly will start against California next
Saturday, did not hold in the line as it
should, and many times did not tackle
well.
Yet at times against the Sagebrushers,
the Cardinals showed flashes of form
that were irresistible. Twice they drove
down the field for touchdowns, and twice
again got within close striking distance
only to be held.
Captain Jack Patrick was Stanford's
best bet Saturday. He played his best
game of the season, both on the offense
and the defense. An analysis of the
game, play by play, shows that he was
responsible for exactly half of,the Card
gains from scrimmage.
Ray Doughty, halfback, showed to ad
vantage, once breaking away for a long
gain that brought Stanford in a position
to score. He seemed to be the only man
who could stop the fleet Bradshaw, when

the little Nevada quarterback got under
way past the line of scrimmage.
Dud DeGroot, Card center, made
tackle after tackle on both sides of the
line. He looked to be Stanford's strong
est defense in the line.
Douglas started the game by kicking
off to Reed, who ran the ball back to
Nevada's 27-yiard mark. The first quar
ter was largely fought in Stanford terri
tory. Reed got off to two long runs,
and short bucks through the line by
Scranton and Foster endangered he
Cardinal goal twice. Hobbs barely
missed a place kick, the ball striking
against the goal post. A forward pass
fell untouched back of the line on an
other occasion.
The first period went plainly to the
visitors. They were able to go through
the line or to skirt the ends, and yet
Bradshaw had not started carrying the
ball or had not opened up with the
highly touted Nevada open game that
has enabled the Sagebrushers to score
on every team they have played in the
last two years.
Bradshaw's short punt gave Stan
ford its first opportunity at the be
ginning of the second quarter. From
their own 40-yard line the Cards
pushed over for a score in eight plays.
Doughty went for three, four, and
thirty yards, and Patrick broke open
the center of the Nevada line for gains
of eight and ten yards. Patrick finally
bucked it over from the one-foot mark.
Shlaudeman kicked goal.
A penalty on Nevada soon afterward
gave Stanford first down in midfield.
