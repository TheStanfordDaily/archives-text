# CARD-SAGEHEN DRAW RESULTS FROM GAME STARRING BRADSHAW
## Varsity Gridmen are Unable to Solve Nevada's Attack; Patrick Makes Half of Total Yards for Cardinal 
### E. C. WEST, '23 
Nevada University fought Stanford to
a 14-to-14 tie Saturday afternoon in a
game that marked the last to be played
on the present Stanford turf. •
Nevada tied Stanford because it had
"Rabbit" Bradshaw, the fastest thing in
a football suit in the West, and because
the Cards seemed unable to break up
the plays in which he participated.
Bradshaw was easily the star of the
game. It was nothing new to him. He
has been starring ever since he entered
the Reno institution four years ago. He
was simply going good Saturday.
But Stanford should have stopped him
several times when he scampered around
the ends for long gains. Van Gent's
team, minus several men who undoubt
edly will start against California next
Saturday, did not hold in the line as it
should, and many times did not tackle
well.
Yet at times against the Sagebrushers,
the Cardinals showed flashes of form
that were irresistible. Twice they drove
down the field for touchdowns, and twice
again got within close striking distance
only to be held.
Captain Jack Patrick was Stanford's
best bet Saturday. He played his best
game of the season, both on the offense
and the defense. An analysis of the
game, play by play, shows that he was
responsible for exactly half of,the Card
gains from scrimmage.
Ray Doughty, halfback, showed to ad
vantage, once breaking away for a long
gain that brought Stanford in a position
to score. He seemed to be the only man
who could stop the fleet Bradshaw, when

the little Nevada quarterback got under
way past the line of scrimmage.
Dud DeGroot, Card center, made
tackle after tackle on both sides of the
line. He looked to be Stanford's strong
est defense in the line.
Douglas started the game by kicking
off to Reed, who ran the ball back to
Nevada's 27-yiard mark. The first quar
ter was largely fought in Stanford terri
tory. Reed got off to two long runs,
and short bucks through the line by
Scranton and Foster endangered he
Cardinal goal twice. Hobbs barely
missed a place kick, the ball striking
against the goal post. A forward pass
fell untouched back of the line on an
other occasion.
The first period went plainly to the
visitors. They were able to go through
the line or to skirt the ends, and yet
Bradshaw had not started carrying the
ball or had not opened up with the
highly touted Nevada open game that
has enabled the Sagebrushers to score
on every team they have played in the
last two years.
Bradshaw's short punt gave Stan
ford its first opportunity at the be
ginning of the second quarter. From
their own 40-yard line the Cards
pushed over for a score in eight plays.
Doughty went for three, four, and
thirty yards, and Patrick broke open
the center of the Nevada line for gains
of eight and ten yards. Patrick finally
bucked it over from the one-foot mark.
Shlaudeman kicked goal.
A penalty on Nevada soon afterward
gave Stanford first down in midfield.
Shlaudeman passed to Patrick for a
net gain of 20 yards, and the Cardinal
captain then smashed his way through
the Nevada line on two split bucks for
big gains, carrying the ball to the visit
ors' two-yard line, from whence
Shlaudeman took it over. He also
kicked gogl.
Two minutes later, "Rabbit" Brad
shaw showed the fans why he has a
reputation as a broken field runner.
Catching Patrick's punt, the little
Sagebrusher star raced sixty yards
down the left side of the Cardinal de
fense and over the line for Nevada's
first score. Hobbs kicked goal.
The Cardinals threatened to score
soon after the second half started.
Patrick broke through the center of
the line again and dodged his way for
twenty yards before he was dropped.
Doughty made three, Patrick three,
Doughty three again, and Patrick made
it first and ten on the Nevada 22-yard
line.
But the visitors braced. Doughty
was thrown for a five-yard loss, three
forward passes were incomplete, and
Nevada took the ball on downs.
After several punt exchanges, Stan
ford again started making gains
through the Sagebrushers' line. Pat
rick crashed his way over center for
five yards, and Doughty made seven
more. Patrick hit center for eight
yards, and Cleveland, substituting for
Hey, made first down.
Nevada here held three times.
Shlaudeman then tossed a perfectly
executed criss-cross pass to Mertz for
a net gain of 25 yards. Shlaudeman
and Patrick carried the ball to the Ne
vada six-yard line, but the visitors held
and took the ball on downs on their
one-yard mark.
From that time on, Nevada had the
best of the game. They worked their
way on bucks through the line and on

passes to Martin straight down the
field to the Stanford ten-yard line.
Here Van Gent's men held at the line
of scrimmage. With six yards to go
for first down on the fourth play, Reed
passed perfectly to Bradshaw,' who
caught the ball on the two-yard line
and fell over the line for the touch
down that knotted the score.
Nevada seriously threatened to win
in the last few minutes of play when
Middleton started tearing through the
Cardinal line. Time was called, how
even, with Nevada in possession of
the ball on Stanford's seven-yard line.
