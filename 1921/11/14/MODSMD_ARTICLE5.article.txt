# 135-POUND GRIDMEN TAKE 7-0 VICTORY FROM POTTER HIGH
## 
### 
A lateral pass in the last quarter
brought a touchdown and victory to
Stanford's 135-pound football men in
their Saturday morning contest with the
Potter High eleven of San Francisco.
The final score was 7-0. Coach Ken
Lilly was well satisfied with the showing
of his proteges, who have improved con
siderably since their 7-6 defeat, last
Wednesday, at the hands of the William
Warren team, against which Potter High
ran up a 38-0 score.
The winning touchdown came during
the last minutes of play. McAllister of
the Cardinals punted 40 yards to Wright,
who fumbled, giving Stanford the ball in
35-yard territory. A run through left
tackle by McAllister netted ten yards.
Two line-bucks brought the oval to the
20-yard chalk mark. Then with four to
go on the last down, Quarterback War
tier received the ball, ran back and made
a short lateral pass to McAllister, who
gathered in the ovfi land raced through a
broken field for a touchdown. Warner
kicked goal.
The Potter High men threw a scare
into the Stanford lightweights in the
first five minutes, but lost on a fumble.
Just before the gun went off the Potter
back field was hitting the line hard and
had made yardage three times in a row.
Good work was performed by the
lightweight ends, Mcrtz and Younglove.
The playing of the linesmen is much im
proved since the last game, but the men
arc not yet very efficient in amking holes
for the line-plungers. Stanford did not
lose the ball on fumbles, the plays being
run off in'a fairly smooth manner.
