# Real Rowdy Roughs Preparing Program To Tickle Toilers
## 
### 
Shades of Captain Kidd and all the
little kids. Fly out the black flag and
clear the decks for violent action. It's
a rough day ahead.
Captain Kidd and his pirate crew will
be put to Jiame on next Wednesday,
Annual Roughs' Day. Three scenes of
action have been laid out, and three
rough roughnecks have elected them
selves to captain these areas. The law
steps are in command of Ben Parks; E.
Crow has established his rookery at the
Econ. corner; the roughest Roughs are
the engineers, who will be directed by
Mark Evans.
The crew of these areas of roughness
is not to be restricted to the men of
these departments, but the men who
usually hang around are invited to do
their worst for their hangmaster.
Students will not be forced to desert
classes to take part, as all activities are
to cease at class time. The three sec
tions will meet at the engineering cor
ner at noon for a general once-over.
At 4 o'clock all roughs are to meet at
the engineering corner and march to the
bleacher rally with their respective sec
tions.
