1 he ticket sale for "Cheerio," the big
Chappie Football Show, will be held at
1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the
Administration Building and at Cran
dall's in Palo Alto. Everyone is urged
to secure his tickets as soon as possible
as large numbers of visitors will un
doubtedly remain over after the Big
Game to see the production. The prices
will be $1.35 and $1.65. The perform
ance will start promptly at 8 o'clock, to
give everyone an opportunity to attend
the student body dance in Encina gym
nasium immediately afterward.
Frances Merrill, one of the stars in
last year's Junior Opera, plays an im
portant role in the comedy playlet, "The
Imported Punch." This sketch was writ
ten by the members of Theta Sigma Phi,
women's honorary journalistic fratern
tiy, and will be produced as one of the
acts in this year's Chappie^show.
From the very first moment that she
steps upon the stage until the final cur
tain, the play is hers to do with as she
chooses. The success or failure of the
entire act is in her hands. With her
animated and characteristic acting and
pleasing personality, there is no reason
why the "Imported Punch" should not
be the hit of the evening.
She is cast in the part of Miss Theda
Yampem, of the Follies, and is imported
by some over-enthusiastic youngster into
an exclusive fraternity house dance. The
complications that descend upon the
heads of all the party may well be
imagined. In the end, she whirls on to
some new and more thrilling party —
leaving in her wake a multitude of
broken hearts.
It is a good playlet.with a good deal
of originality in the plot and many
clever lines. The cast, as chosen, is ad
mirable. But after all, Frances Merrill
is the "punch" that has been "imported"
into it to make it a success. Without
her spontaneous enthusiasm and delight
ful personality, the action itself would
be dull and the effect but rhcdiocre. She
strides onto the stage in the characteris
tic "Merrill" way, and from that point
on everyone else fades into the back
ground as a part of the scenery to lend
effect and color to her triumph.
A special seat sale will be held tonight
at 7 o'clock in the Administration Build
ing for the cast of Cheeri-o Revue.
