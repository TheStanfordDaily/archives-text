<$> Whispered conversation cur- <S>
<«> rent on the campus today <♦>
<$> seemed to indicate that some- <S>
<$> thing of general interest to all <$>
<$> roughs and observers of roughs' <$>
<$> antics would probably appear <$>
<$> in printed form tomorrow. Ru- <$>
<$>mor has it that these objects <S>
<$> of interest entail the exchange <S>
<*> of a dime between the vendor <$>
and the ultimate possessor. <3>
<§> Definite knowledge of the mys- <J>
•> terious matter will probably be <$>
<$> given out about eight o'clock <$>
<$> tomorrow morning.
