# VARSITY STARTS PRACTICE FOR BIG GAME SATURDAY
## Van Gent Orders Secret Work as Classic Between Girds and Bears Approaches 
### 
Attention of football fans is this week
riveted on the biggest of all big games
in the West.
Stanford's varsity started intensive
secret practice last night for the battle
Saturday in the new stadium with the
"wonder team" of the California Bruins.
Barred doors will keep the interested
away for the rest of the week.
The next time that the campus grid
followers will get a glimpse of Gene
Van Gent's team will be when Captain
Jack Patrick leads the squad on the turf
Saturday afternoon about 2:30.
Photographers were allowed on the
field during the first part of last night's
workout. After Patrick, Wilcox, and a
host of others had been snapped in every
pose imaginable, the field police cleared
the field, stationed themselves at the
doors, and the week's siege commenced.
It's a 10-to-l shot that more depends
on this week's workout than on any dur
ing the entire season. The hard work is
practically over. It's the finishing touches
that must be put on this week.
It seems logical that open work and
trick plays will feature the Cardinal
offensive against the Bruins. Andy
Smith's line, generally regarded as the
strength of the wonder organization
which has not known defeat in the past
two years, has not been pierced this year
and there is no reason to believe that the
comparatively light Stanford backs will
be able to go through it for any material
gains.
The Bruins, however, have been scored
on several times by passing and by trick
plays. U. S. C. did it in live plays, the
Pacific Fleet did it, Nevada did it. And
Bob Shlaudeman, as accurate as any
man on the coast with the forward pass,
probably knows a few plays that the
Bruins have never seen, or anyone else
outside the varsity squad, for that mat
ter.
Van Gent has not had his men open
up in their last two games. Against
Nevada the Cards used only straight line
plays, off-tackle bucks, a few end runs
and ten forward passes, all from regu
lar formation.
Duffy Seay will have his freshman
team out on the field all week to give
the varsity the best practice possible.
With the Big Game only a few days
off, it's a toss-up as to who will start
the game. Such a condition has rarely
existed before the big brawl. The back
field seems easy enough. Bob Shlaude
man looks certain to start at quarter,
Art Wilcox and Ray Doughty are down
on the book for the halves, and Captain
Patrick, whose sensational work against
Nevada livened an otherwise rather dis
appointing showing by the varsity, is
sure to be at fullback.
It is the Cardinal line that is giving the
dopesters all the worry. Rumor has it
that Van Gent is grooming a couple of
new ends to open the big fracas. What
truth there is in such reports remains
to be seen.
Harley Carter and Fred Ludeke, both
weighing at the 200-pound mark, look
due to start at the tackles. "Red" Betts,
veteran of the famous Big Game two
years ago, seems certain to play one of
the guard positions. Faville, it is said,
may be at one of the wings. It is a
guess, however, that he will run on the
field at the other guard. Dud DeGroot
is a sure shot for the center job.
Stanford's squad will be in good shape
for the big tussle. Shlaudeman sus
tained several injuries against Nevada,
but the star Cardinal quarterback has
never been on the side lines through in
juries yet, and he will be in shape when
the gun sounds Saturday. Dick Faville
was not in suit last night because of the
bangs he got against the Sagebrushers,
but he will be ready to play Saturday.
"Kewp" Sproull, who has been 011 the
hospital list for two weeks with a bad
wrist, is back in the fold and ready for
action.
