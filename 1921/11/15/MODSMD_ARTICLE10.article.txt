## 
### 
Recognition of dramatic ability was
given Gordon Davis, '19, instructor in
dramatics at Stanford, in the November
issue of the Billboard Magazine. In a
full page article by Milt llagen, 15, and
again on the cover, Davis is referred to
as "a western Belasco."
"Reviews in the San Francisco news
papers speak most enthusiastically of the
work of Davis," the article says, and
continues: Personally, he is a most un
assuming bundle of live wire energy."
Davis is compared to David Belasco in
his efforts to train college actors and
audiences to a greater discrimination of
art and plays.
"Beginning his professional career at
sixteen," the Billboard adds, "Davis' was
placed P. D. Q. on the vaudeville stage
as leading man of a one-act play for
five persons, which he wrote himself.
Refusing a good part in a large Broad
way production four years later, he en
rolled as a pea green freshman at Le
land Stanford Junior University, where
he secured his degree."
Praise was given Davis for his or
ganization of student talent in making
Stanford dramatic productions entirely
student creations. The purpose of the
Little Theater, work of the Dramatic
Council, and the Department of Oral
Expression are declared by the article
to be in advance of many universities in
the country.
