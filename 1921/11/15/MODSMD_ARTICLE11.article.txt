# JOHN G. NEIHARDT TO LECTURE THIS EVENING
## "Poetry and Education" Will Be Theme of Talk Given by Poet Laureate of Nebraska 
### 
John G. Neihardt, the Poet Laureate
of Nebraska, and the first American
poet to be given this title by any state,
will speak tonight at 7:30 in the Little
Theatre. His subject will be "Poetry
and Education." He is the author of a
large number of volumes of poetry and
contributes fiction .and articles to popu
lar magazines.
The subject which Neihardt will lec
ture on this evening is the one on which
he spoke when he was officially made
Poet Laureate of Nebraska. He will
explain some of his theories of poetry
and poetry writing which he has been
formulating and developing during the
last twenty years.
Neihardt is said to have developed
the national epic more than any other
man of today and, on account of this,
to have done one of the few original
things that have been accomplished in
the field of American poetry. He puts
into his work a spirit of courage and a
vigor which typified the early settlers
who struggled to gain a foothold in and
open up the unexplored regions of the
United States. For the last seven years
he has been devoting his time to writing
an epic cycle, two volumes of which
have, already been published. The first
of these, "The Song of Hugh Glass,"
was first printed in 1915, and has since
been put into an annotated school edi
tion which is studied as a classic in
many public schools. "The Song of
Three Friends" won the prize for the
best volume of verse published by an
American during the year 1919. Nei
hardt is now at work upon the third of
the series, which he calls "The Song of
the Indian Wars." For six years he
lived among the Omaha Indians to study
their character, history, legends, and
customs.
After taking a scientific course at the
Nebraska Normal College, Neihardt re
ceived his degree in 1897. He took the
degree of Doctor of Literature at the
University of Nebraska in 1917. He
spoke at Stanford four years ago.
