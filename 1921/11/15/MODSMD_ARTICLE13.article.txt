# "YOU NEVER CAN TELL" NAMED AS SOPHOMORE PLAY
## Cast for Production To Be Made Public by Coach Gordon Davis Tomorrow 
### 
"You Never Can Tell," George Ber
nard Shaw's most brilliant comedy, a
play having behind it an international
record of past successes, has been
chosen by the Sophomore Class for
presentation on the evening of Decem
ber 3. The play was decided upon when
it was found that Percy Mackaye's "A
Thousand Years Ago" presented diffi
culties in the matter of cost of produc
tion and the impossibility of staging
with the Assembly Hall facilities.
The Shaw play is real comedy in
every sense of the word. The lines are
bright, the characters intriguing, and the
situations continually arising are novel
and contain that ever-essential element
of comedy—suspense. It is the unex
pected that will always happen in "You
Never Can Tell."
The play has been produced all over
the world. The original parts were
played by Arnold Daly and Mabel Talia
ferro, of "Polly of the Circus" fame, and
since that time it has been one of the
most popular comedies on the American
stage.
A dentist's operating room with its
array of dental equipment, dentist's
chair, laughing gas, and all the gory and
gruesome details of the lair, is the set
ting of the first act. To this den of
terror comes a woman, sometime bereft
of her erstwhile husband, bringing with
her from the Island of Madeira in the
Mediterranean her stately daughter and
small twins, a boy and gii*l who have
absorbed all the savagery of their island
retreat.
Of course there is romance involving
the dashing young dentist and the lovely
daughter, and interspersed with the tac.-
tics of the twins. Further complications
ensue when the wandering hus'band re
turns. • : ' ;.
All these parts will be handled by a
capable cast. Rehearsals ar,e already in
progress, and Coach Davis feels that he
has secured excellent material for the
personnel of his play. Much new talent
has also been discovered. The entirfc
cast will be announced tomorrow.
