Thousands of people in cars and on foot will be
on the campus all day Saturday, and probably many
of them will be here for the first time. They will
not know the general lay of the land as far as the
places of parking for machines are concerned, and
a large part of the crowd will not know the way to
get around the University grounds to the places
they will wish to visit. For the autoists coming
onto the campus from either north or south there
have been worked out very comprehensive plans for
routing the incoming and outgoing autos on the
University grounds and on the nearby highways.
Without the assistance of the part of the student
body that lives here and knows just where the
various parts of the campus are, it will be impossible
for the traffic officers to keep all of the vast crowd
moving, and unnecessary jams in traffic will result.
The whole plan of traffic routings has been made out
clearly and is in tonight's issue of the Daily. If
each student will make himself clear on all the
points contained therein and get the many parking
places in mind he can be of inestimable help in
giving directions to the people who will be in search
of the places to park around the campus.
A majority of students here have friends who are
coming to the game. You will expedite their
coming a great deal if you will write them clear
directions as to which route they may best take in
conformity with the regulations as laid down by the
University traffic officials and Chief Noble of the
Palo Alto Police Department. Plenty of room is
available on the campus for all the machines which
will be brought, but they will not be able to maneuver
without your help in sending them around the
grounds to the places where they must go. Tell
them in advance where they can best leave their cars
to get out on the north or south highway after the
game, and they will be glad enough to get the help
to repay your effort. At the game there will be
many officers and student police who will direct the
crowds. Confusion is bound to occur, however, and
•it is to the interest of all student body members to
Jielp mitigate this as much as possible by courteous
.attention that can be given to our guests on the day
•of the game. This is our day to show what real
.hospitality can be, by everyone co-operating in
making all of our guests feel as much at home as
jpossible. Perfect success will come only if each and
everyone does his utmost.
