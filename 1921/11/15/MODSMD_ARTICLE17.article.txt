### 
Thursday is election day for a member of the
Student Executive Committee from the Class of
1922 t and a student member of the Board of Athletic
Control. The election, while not for a large number
of officers, is important in that the student member
of the Athletic Board is the one man who represents
directly the interests of the students of the Uni
versity on the Board, lie is the man who carries
the student viewpoint, and should l)e chosen as a
man who has the ability to present this viewpoint
successfully, and will use this ability faithfully for
the best interests of the whole Ixxly and not for any
particular clique. He should be a man who is with
out fear of politics and will do his duty as his
conscience directs. The member of the Senior
Class on the Executive Committee should be chosen
for what he is as a good member of the student Ixxly.
He is one of the senior members of the committee
and handles the vital interests of the undergraduate
l)ody on the campus. The man should be chosen to
be truly representative of all the students.
