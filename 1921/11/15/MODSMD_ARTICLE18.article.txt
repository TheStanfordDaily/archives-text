						New Privilege.
## 
### 
At the rally tomorrow a new role will be offered
I he five hundred members comprising the feminine

portion of the student body. The rough has at last
conceded to them a part in his day of days.
The women will not only have the privilege of
reviewing the spectacle but will also act in the
official capacity of judges, when the three con
tingents of roughs of all varieties, arrayed in tra
ditional attire, assemble in the stadium to celebrate
the grand finale of their gala day.
This invitation to the women represents more
than the opportunity of presiding at the lists and
viewing the contests of knights erring and errant.
It is an indication that their place as an integral part
of the student body is becoming recognized. The
presence of all the women is desired on the first
official entrance of the stadium by the student body,
and they are also to take part in the rally and songs
which are to follow the parade. It is an advance in
the same direction as that made recently in reserving
a special section for the women at bleacher rallies
and at games. Their response to this was all that
could have been asked for. They have demon
strated that their interest in everything that pertains
to University affairs is genuine.
Any step that leads toward the furtherance of
this interest is a step toward the most desirable ideal
of student government â€”the co-operation and united
support of each and every individual concerned.
