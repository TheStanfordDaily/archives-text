See where Student Body Presidents of Coast colleges
met in Seattle and went on record as opposed to drives.
We're with you student B.P.'s; we're so financially em
barrassed that our pockets are blushing.

There's a place called Orcal on the Oregon-California
line. We favor calling it Calorie.
» * ♦
There are several other such places, for example Tex
arkana, Mexicali and Calexico. We suggest in the name
of art for geography's sake the following: (Note:
Boundaries are affected by punsmith's license):
Washcan for Canada-Washington boundary towns.
Kodak for Colorado-Dakota metropoli.
Kanmiss for Kansas-Missouri tanktowns.
* * *
....A co-ed has requested earnestly that we don't write
any more bum poems for this column. We're obliged
for the flattery, as most of the black-hand threats re
ceived have intimated that even Walt Mason wouldn't
call our stuff "poetry."

Somewhere below you will find a poem. Look care
fully. If you think it's bum, don't read it. If it isn't,
frame it.

Did you ever—
Call Roble and get Roble?
Remember your hotel room when you had to?
Win anything at a raffle?
Fail to overdraw your bank account when you had
lost your check-book?
* * *
/
If you did, you got the RIGHT NUMBER, and are
either a liar or a day-dreamer; in either of which cases
you don't belong here.

While you're waiting to get there, don't forget the
tag day for Injured Roughs. Help the cause along. Re

Oppression!
I am foaming at the mouth
I effervesce
With an all-consuming spirit
All consume my spirit
Now
My strength
Is gone
I am weak
Ah, so weak!
I am a glass of beer.

The wrecks are still rambling. Native son just
offered us 21-point money on his mid-quarter.
• • *
But we accept his suggestion. Herewith follows a
new department—"Dumbbell Sayings of Bright Chil
dren." The first one is a knockout. Here it is:
Fond mother: "See the pretty lion in the cage, dear."
Precocious infant: "Bla-bla-bla!"
• * •
If you can see anything funny in that, give us your
name, and we'll turn you over to the University au
thorities.
• * •
Here's one that Hamburger Joe sent us. Should he
be shot or hung? We can't decide which.
Mother: "Look at the funny goat, Aurelius."
6-mos.-old child: "Come on, ma, don't try to kid me!"
* * *
Musta been damp in Seattle. Bob has water on the
elbow, and Dud got it on the knee. T. I. never takes

There was a young doctor named Lynn,
Who saw a man lunch on a pin;
Despite your surmise,
He showed no surprise,
He knew the man ate at the Inn.
