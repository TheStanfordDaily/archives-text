# HIRST PREDICTS WIN BY CONSERVATIVES
##

"Letters and papers recently received
from England compel me to believe that
Lloyd George will be forced to resign
from office within the next few days or
weeks, the Conservative party assuming
charge of the situation," said Francis W.
Hirst to his audience yesterday after
noon in the Little Theatre. "There is no
reason why parts of the Liberal and
Conservative parties should not combine
for a regime of economy," he continued,
"though Lord Gray's policy is not so
clearly defined as to insure definite sup
port."
According to Professor Hirst, England
is not fond of coalition governments, and
the electors like to feel their repre
sentatives have higher political standards
than they themselves. Regarding the
possible leaders in the new government,
should Lloyd George be refused the
right to dissolve Parliament, he sug
gested his former Oxford associate,
Lord Birkenhead, as a possible prime
minister. Austin Chamberlin, a man
hampered somewhat by scruples and not
at all pliable, Bonar Law, whose retire
ment from politics may have been only
a pretext, Lord Robert Cecil, Lord As
quith, and Lord Balfour, who now heads
the British delegation to Washington,
were mentioned as possible leaders.
Professor Hirst discijssed five differ
ent types of Conservatives found in
England, beginning with the old fash
ioned Tory. This type is being driven
from England by war and taxation,
which lie believes differs from confisca
tion only in degree.
"The Tory imperialist has always been
associated with a dash of socialism,"
declared Professor Hirst, "and orig
inated with Disraeli in the early 705."
Sir Robert Peel, the Marquis of Salis
bury, and Lord Balfour are examples of
the Conservative opportunist.
The Tory socialist or democrat group
also had its origin with Disraeli, and to
day finds leadership in Lord Birken
head, the wittiest of Tory platform
speakers.
The Whig or Liberal Conservative
group was scarccly noticeable before the
war, and is dominated now by the Mar
quis of Lansdowne, who is one of the
five most interesting and impressive liv
ing Englishmen.
"Practically none of Lloyd George's
House of Commons supporters are really
supporting him," quoted Professor Hirst
from a message received recently from
< r ood authority.
