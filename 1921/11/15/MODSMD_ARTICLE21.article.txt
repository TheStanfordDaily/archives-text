# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB PRESENTS VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT
## 
### 
The Cosmopolitan Club's "Interna
tional Night" program, presented in the
Women's Clubhouse last night, offered
a diversified entertainment, furnished by
the talent of eight countries. The stage
was appropriately decorated with the
flags of the different nationalities.
Eight-year-old Miwa Kai of San Fran
cisco, in a gayly colored butterfly cos
tume, typified all that her dance, "Spring
time," symbolized. Yoshio Kai, another
child artist, accompanied her. A song
of child life, her second recitation, de
scribed childish cares. "Minuet in G,"
a piano solo, was her final selection.
Miss Kahortt Saito, in a gypsy toe dance,
described the carefree life of gypsy
vagabonds.
The quartet furnished by the Areopa
gus Club, negro minstrels from the Uni
versity of California, were the laugh
producers of the evening, with their
medleys of old southern melodies and
novelty rags.
Typewriter music by the Filipino sex
tette was a surprise to the audience. The
rapid click of the keys and the sharp
cling of the bell was distinctly brought
out. Their representation of the opera,
"La Paloma," on string instruments, was
a favorable innovation.
Backhand springs, balancing, pyramids
and several novelty tumbling stunts were
demonstrated by four members of the
Stanford Gym Club.
Mrs. Armine Martin, a native Arme
nian, sang a popular Armenian tune and
gave a violin solo with Araxie Vartanian
as accompanist.
Two representatives of the Chinese
Club were on the program. They gave
an exhibition of jugglery with illumi
nated Indian clubs, and performed tricks
known to ancient Chinese.
