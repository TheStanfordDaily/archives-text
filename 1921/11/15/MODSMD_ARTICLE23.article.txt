# SEQUOIA RELAY TEAM WINS IN INTRAMURAL
## 
### 
Sequoia Hall's relay team of ten men
took first honors in the intramural track
held last Thursday on the varsity oval.
A mounted bronze was awarded to Se
quoia.
Theta Chi won a second relay contest
in which the teams were composed of
eight men. However, the decision was
protested, so the intramural committee
has arranged to have the race take place
next Thursday. An "outlaw" team com
posed of Sudden, Mcintosh, Chandler,
Van Judah, and Van Wyck, with the
first two men running twice, would
probably have won had not one of the
men failed to pass the baton. The race
next Thursday will be open to all or
ganizations, but not to outlaw teams.
