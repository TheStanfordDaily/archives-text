## 
### 
Not to be outdone by people living on
the campus, the students commuting
daily between San Jose and Palo Alto
have organized a rooting section on the
5 :25 p. m. train on their way home every
evening. The commuters have objected
to the charge that they are not on the
boat, and the leaders of the movement
plan to have every commuter know the
songs and yells perfectly by the night
of the Big Game Rally on next Thurs
day.
