# PREPARATIONS NOW COMPLETE FOR BIG DEBATE WITH BEARS
## 
### 
Two weeks from tonight the varsity
debating team representing the Univer
sity will meet the aggregation from
across the bay in the annual Stanford-
California debate. This contest will be
held in the Stanford Assembly Hall, and
gives promise of being a real battle
royal.
Coach Emerson of the varsity has ar
ranged the order of speakers as fol
lows: Matthew Tobriner, Richard Jen
kins, and Ward Miller. The time limit
for the initial speeches has been set at
15 minutes, with an 8-minute limit oil re
buttals. The question which has been
chosen is as fololws: "Resolved, that
Congress should enact a law to exempt
coastwise shipping of the United States
from payment of the Panama canal
tolls."
The three speakers on the Stanford
team are well qualified to uphold their
end of the argument. Richard Jenkins
is a freshman in the University, but has
an enviable record as a high school de
bater in his home townâ€”Los Angeles.
Miller comes here as a junior from the
University of Texas, and while there,
participated in a number of varsity de
bates with the colleges of the South.
Tobriner is the only man on the team
who has had experience in debating at
this institution. Last year he was a
member of the squad that met the fresh
man team of the University of Califor
nia, and later in the season took part
in the annual freshman-sophomore de
bate. Tobriner is a member of Eu
phronia Debating Society.
