A graphophone which was taken from
the Sigma Nu house last spring has
been returned to its rightful owners by
Sheric Lyle of San Jose. Following the
arrest and conviction of two men for
burglary, Lyle was able to place them as
the ones who helped themselves to a
number of musical instruments on the
campus last spring, and traced the
graphophone to a San Jose pawnshop.
He expects to recover the other instru
ments stolen at this time within a few
days.
