# POLO TAMS CLASH IN EVEN MATCHES OF SECOND SERIES
## 
### 
The Browns will meet the Whites,
and the Blues will clash with the Reds
in the second polo series tomorrow.
Owing to the numerous events of Big
Game week, the date of the contests was
changed from Friday.
The Brown-White match will show
whether the Browns, previously rated as
the wealÂ«.'st team in the tournament, will
be able to show the same form they dis
played when they held the Reds to a
one-point vistory last week. They are
to meet the crack team of the campus,
but have the advantage of a handicap of
seven. The Whites slumped in their
previous contest, and their play may
continue in the same way tomorrow.
The Blue riders have previously de
feated the Reds, but with their handi
cap advantage lowered to two points,
and with Major Collins shifted to the
offensive for the Reds, the result is un
certain.
The teams went through simple for
mation plays in practice yesterday after
noon, as an introduction to the trick
passing system which is a feature of
polo. Much faster play has resulted
from the scraping of the field last week.
