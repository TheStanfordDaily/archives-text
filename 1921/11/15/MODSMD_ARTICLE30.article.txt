# BRONCHO BUSTER IS FOUND IN STANFORD R. O. T. C. BEGINNERS
## 
### 
Norton Worden, Stanford freshman
enrolled in the local unit of the R. O.
T. C., has distinguished himself as a
horseman by successfully riding the two
most refractory horses belonging to the
local artillery detachment.
One horse, known as number 70, had
not been successfully ridden in over a
year, the last rider who had been able
to ride the horse having been thrown
three times in the attempt. Worden
managed the horse without difficulty, al
though the animal made frantic efforts
to dislodge the rider, plunging and
bucking for nearly half an hour.
The other horse ridden by Worden
was number 62. This animal has not
the reputation for viciousness possessed
by number 70, but gave a good fight. In
a final attempt to unseat Worden, the
horse rolled over, but aside from a few
scratches, the rider escaped injury.
Worden came to Stanford from Mon
tana, where he had a year's experience
in riding.
Worden's rides were witnessed by
Major Collins of the R. O. T. C., and
other officers of the detachment, all of
whom gave him much praise for his
handling of the horses.
