# ROBLE BRIDGE REPAIRS WORK IS COMPLETED
## 
### 
Roble bridge is now completely reno
vated. First condemned, then given an
other lease on life, and now completely
reconstructed, the historic structure
stands ready to bear its burden once
more.
New pilings in solid bases support re
inforced girders, held securely in place
by extra braces. Over 'his is laid a new
plank walk. The reconstructed bridge
follows identically the proportions of its
predecessor.
