# WATER POLO SEVEN BEATS NEPTUNES IN NATIONAL TOURNEY
## 
### 
Neptune Club of Alameda gave Stan
ford's water polo team a close call last
night at the Olympic Club tank. \\ lien
the linal gun went off Brandsten's
charges had three points to the Ala
medans' two, and had the first game in
the national junior water polo cham
pionships tucked away.
Rated as a fairly weak aggregation,
the Neptunes livened up the play in the
second half, but the varsity went them
one better in shooting goals and in de
fensive work. Stanford was leading at
half time 2 to 0, Strauss and Sol Miller
having contributed one score apiece. In
the final period, the Neptunes took many
long shots at the goal, but Greppin and
his long arms were always in the way.
The clubmen finally succeeded in push
ing in two scores, tieing the count. With
but a few minutes left to play, Strauss
shot the winning goal for the Cardinal.
Stanford's hardest game in the fight
for the national title will take place to
morrow night, when they oppose the
Olympic juniors. The Olympics are gen
erally regarded as having the champion
ship already sewed up, and Stanford
will go into the fray on the short end
of the odds. California was an easy vic
tim of the clubmen last night, losing
14 to 0.
The winner of the championship will
probably be decided by the end of the
week. Stanford will play the Blue and
Gold seven next Tuesday, but if the
Cardinals lose to the Olympics they will
have to be content with second place.
