# CONFERENCE VOTES TO MEET AT UTAH FOR NEXT SESSION
## 
### 
Next year's Women's Intercollegiate
Conference will be held in Salt Lake.
Such was the unanimous vote of the
convention, cast at the last meeting on
Thursday, in answer to the invitation
extended by the University of Utah.
A discussion of "Religious Needs"
opened the morning session. Miss Mary
1. Bcntley introduced the subject with a
brief address in which she deplored the
negative aspect which Christianity has
come to have, and declared that women
especially ought to bring to it a more
positive power.
Campus activities came in next for
their share of discussion; The chief dif
ficulty found in most of the institutions
represented was a tendency on the part
of a few students to carry on too large
a share of the work. Athletics, the arts,
and executive work were picked as the
activities leading to a well-rounded
campus life, provided that they were
not indulged in to an extent which
would sacrifice health and scholarship.
Plans were made for the maintenance
of a permanent Exchange Bureau, con
sisting of an exchange secretary who
will be appointed each year from the
university at which the conference was
last held, and a corresponding repre
sentative at each university. It is hoped
that this bureau will perpetuate the work
of the conference and be of service in
solving individual problems through the
concerted effort of intercollegiate aid.
