Phil Ncer, '22, won the Stanford Cup
by defeating Ford Tussing, '22, in three
straight sets, 6-1, 8-6, 7-5, in the finals
of the men's singles tennis tournament,
played on the varsity courts last Thurs
day. The trophy was donated by R.
Lindley Murray, '16, the Stanford man
who has twice captured the national sin
gles tennis championship. Tussing's con
sistent, well-placed shots forced the var
sity captain to play his best, and after
the first set the match was close and
hard-fought. The second and third sets
were full of long deuce games.
Neer had little trouble in taking the
first set, 6-1, by his service and volleying.
Tussing made his playing more effective
in the next set, and gained the lead at
4-3. Long rallies characterized the fol
lowing games which were tied at five-all
and sijc-all. Some very exceptional re
turns of Neer's fast drives were made
by Tussing. Neer annexed two straight
games and the set after the six-all tie,
winning every point in the last game.
In the final set, Tussing started off
well and rolled up a five to one score.
His driving from the base-line was
effective, and he made frequent advances
to the net to perform some high-class
volleying. Tussing possesses a top-drive,
typical of Southern California players,
which he uses continually. His mid
court game cost him the set. Neer's
shots began to dust out the corners of
the court, and his net work forced Tus
sing to the back line. Four games in a
row tied the set at five-all. In the next
two games Tussing led each time by a
30-love score, but gave way to Neer's
playing, losing the set and match.
