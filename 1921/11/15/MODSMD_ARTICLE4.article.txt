# "BIG GAME ADVANCE DOPE NOT CONCLUSIVE OF OUTCOME," POWELL
## Game Saturday Will Be Best of Year and May Show Surprises Not on the Card 
### 
"Stanford will cover itself with glory
Saturday. The team will play the best
game it has played so far this season, or
my faith in mankind is shattered. On
dope, California should win, but dope
does not decide games. Stanford fight
will be in the battle up to the last minute,
so be ready for a surprise."
This was Athletic Director Walter
Powell's summary of the Stanford
chances in the Big Game, given last night
in the concluding lecture of "The Tech
nique of American Football" series un
der the auspices of Powell and
Debating Society.
He declared the varsity line is 50 per
cent stronger and the backfield much
improved over that of the team last year
that made such a determined stand, the
"patched-up, lighter team playing on the
muddy California Field."
Powell declared that more games are
won and lost through generalship than
any other cause. He said that the kick
ing game can not be too strongly em
phasized, especially if the team has
strong punters and ends. "Keep the
other team guessing when you get into
a scoring position," Powell urged. "The
cardinal principle for quarterbacks is to
make every play look like one thing and
wind up something else."
Powell carefully retraced the errors
in generalship that cost the freshmen the
game Friday. He described various spo
cific plays as wellâ€”screen, shift, quick
kick, Statue of Liberty, and particularly
those employed this season by the Cali
fornia eleven. The defenses for them
were left for Van Gent to demonstrate
Saturday.
"To prophesy," Powell concluded, "is
foolish, except to say, you can not live
in a Stanford environment and look for
ward to certain defeat. Prepare for
great things."
