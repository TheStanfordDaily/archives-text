Ye Editor: As an assistant to the
Yell Leader whom yoU wronged in
Monday's editorial, I wish to take this
opportunity of pointing out the wrong
stand that you took 011 the question of
yelling while signals are being called.
It is only a common courtesy to both
teams that rooters remain silent during
the calling of signals, and while the
shouting of a few individuals would not
necessarily interfere with either team,
this would encourage others in unor
ganized yelling, which would become in
tolerable, and not only handicap playing,
but seriously interfere with the ecective
ness of the rooting section.
A Yell Leader's job is at least to lead
the rooting, and that is done according
to certain approved standards. Con
structive criticism is always welcome,
but here the Editor has no justification,
because the effect of his article would be
to utterly disregard co-operation, and
eVeryone knows that co-operation is es
sential, particularly in good rooting. And
the bleachers must more than ever show
the best possible Standard Spirit in the
Big Game.
As a matter of fact, Stanford has an
agreement with California whereby si
lence will be maintained while signals
are being called, and the Yell Leaders
will earnestly endeavor to enforce that
obligation of honor.
L. B. MINSKY, '2.3.
