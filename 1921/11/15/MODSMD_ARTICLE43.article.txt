# Sequoia Plans To Mourn California's Passing
## 
### 
At a short meeting of Sequoia Hall
last night, plans were made for the
holding of the Sequoia Wake, which is
held each year on Wednesday preceding
the Big Game. The wake takes the
form of a funeral procession around the
campus, and ends at the rally fire, upon
which an effigy, provided by the hall, is
placed. Last year a large coffin was
used, but the committee would not di
vulge the nature of the contribution
this year.
