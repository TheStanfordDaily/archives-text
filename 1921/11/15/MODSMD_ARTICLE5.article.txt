# BIG GAME SHOW WILL INTRODUCE CAMPUS QUEENS
## Eight Beauties Selected by Coach Seib as Nucleus of Big Football Show Chorus 
### 
WORTH WILSON CALDWELL, '24
The seat drawings for the Hammer
and Coffin Football Show were con
ducted at 1 o'clock this afternoon in the
lobby of the Administration Building.
The largest crowd of the season was on
hand soon after lunch in quest of the
precious pasteboard. However, those in
charge report that there are still a num
ber of excellent seats available for
campus distribution.
Undoubtedly the biggest single feature
of the Chappie Show is the carefully
selected and well trained Beauty Chorus.
Coach Seib undertook the lal>orious and
difficult task of choosing eight of the
most beautiful women in the University,
and he has acquitted himself admirably.
Janice Dunker has spent some time in
arranging the costuming effects for the
Beauty Chorus. Those who know her
artistic ingenuity will expect some start
ling surprises in the costumes on Satur
day night. An excellent opportunity is
offered her to this end in the varied
musical numbers throughout the evening.
The Prologue contains the Inferno
scene, and here the chorus will appear
in the fiery red draperies of the tra
ditional Hell. Suddenly the atmosphere
changes, and the orchestra swings into
that haunting melody, "Sweet Sixteen."
This calls for a complete change of cos
tume and they appear next in the role
of charming colonial maids.
In the Beauty Chorus one may find
any conceivable type of loveliness. For
the one who chooses the tall, stately pa
trician type of beauty, there is Dorothy
Buffum. As a distinct opposite, stands
dainty little Mary Jane Clark. Then,
too, there is Mildred Hoover, impulsive,
vivacious and fascinating; on the other
hand, there remains Peggy Richardson,
dreamy, captivating, and bewitchingly
beautiful.
Neva Muscio is a rare combination of
good looks and clever dancing ability,
while Dorothy Gardner, with her infinite
charm, is entrancing. The other two
members of the cast are equally as good.
Lura Spangler has a wholesome spon
taneity that marks her singing and
dancing as extremely individual. Helen
Hauge is tall, yet very graceful, and
carries her share of the work with an
ease and assurance that makes her in
dispensable.
