# FIRST STADIUM RALLY TO TERMINATE ROUGH'S DAY
## 
### 
A rally will take place in the new
Stanford stadium as the closing event
of the annual Roughs' day, which will
hold sway tomorrow from sunrise to
sunset on the "farm." The committee in
charge of the Roughs' Day activities has
made preparations to make the celebra
tion tomorrow the greatest in history.
It is the desire of the yell leader to
make the first rally in the new stadium
one of the best bleacher rallies that has
ever been held in the west.
This will be the first time that the
Stanford students have entered the new
Cardinal stadium as a body, and from
all indications every member of the stu
dent body will turn out to witness the
sight and to have the honor of being a
participant in the first stadium rally.
At 3:40 all the Roughs will assemble
at engineering corner and march as a
unit to the stadium. The parade to the
stadium will be made up of three sets
of Roughs—those who generally can be
found between classes at the Economics
steps, the Law majors, and the engi
neers. Tt is rumored that the enßineers
plan to hold sway on Roughs' day be
cause of the wonderful job that their
fellow engineers did in completing the

stadium. There is a chance that the en
gineers will challenge the Law majors
to a rooting contest, and in this way
decide who is the ruler of the day.
The rival contingents of roughs will
parade around the stadium track and
pass before the women, who will act as
a reviewing section in the bleachers.
After the unshaven roughnecks have
displayed themselves before the women
they will take their seats in section C
of the stadium. This is the location of
the Cardinal rooting section during the
Big Game, and the rooters will be given
such directions as the yell leaders deem
necessary to have the rooters know pre
vious to the Big Game.
Roughs' day tradition is one that is
always looked forward to with great in
terest by all students. Tt is always held
on the Wednesday preceding the Stan
ford-California games, and has as its
purpose the arousing of the Big Game
lighting spirit which starts with Roughs'
day and continues through Saturday
night.
The presence of the women is espe
cially desired that they may give the
Roughs a rousing reception on their
triumphal march around the bowl, and
that they may join in the singing.
