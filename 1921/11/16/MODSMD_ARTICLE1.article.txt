# DIRECTOR FACES VARIED PROBLEMS IN CAMPUS SHOW
## Difficulties of Management Are Principal Troubles to Bother Rest of Coach Seib 
### 
The time is rapidly drawing near
for Hammer and Coffin to stage their
spectacular Big Game Football Show.
The box office has been opened and
the tickets have gone like hot-cakes;
the costumes have been designed and
are now in the last sttatges of pre
paration; the stagehands have com
pleted the scenery; the cast have
mastered their lines and their places;
and all that remains is for the di
rector to give the signal that will set
in motion on Saturday night, the
smartest show of the season.
Of course at this time, the show
is not the finished production that it
will be at the time of presentation.
There are many rough edges that will
have t obe cut down and smoothed
awayy. But now, for the first time
since rehearsals started, the continu
ity of the various acts is perfectly
apparent. Coach Seib is confronted
by a very peculiar and difficult prob
lem in the staging of this show, the
solution of which will be watched with
interest by campus dramatic critics.
The trouble does not lie in the coach
ing of the production itself as the tac
tics used here will be commonplace
and conventional enough, but rather
in the organization and management
of the entire show. It is a simple
enough matter to prepare an individu
al act so that it will get over. The
problem is to take ten just such
sketches and so arrange and co-ordin
ate them that they will provide an
interesting evening's entertainment.
The usual mistake in performances
of this nature is the tendency to pro
long the action until the weary audi
ence sneaks out in the middle of the
show, yawning and bored to tears.
This is the common error that Coach
Seib intends to keep out of the Chap
pie Show. Every cue will be snatched
off of the speakers' mouth by the next
one to talk and no opportunity will
be given for the action to lag. There
will be no long delays between scenes
or intermissions, for, while the sets
are being changed, specialty acts will
hold the attention of the audience be
fore the curtain.
If the director manages to accomp
lish these things—and he says he will
—every moment of the "Cheerio"
revue should be characterized by pep
and action. Amateur vaudeville too
often fails because of lack of unity
between the individual acts and too
many unnecessary delays. If these
are successfully obviated in the per
formance Saturday night, Coach Seib
may well congratulate himself on a
distinct departure from the old order
or things. Undoubtedly, the attention
of the campus dramatic will be riveted
on the experiment in the Football
Show. If this experiment fails, spec
tacular revues and vaudeville per
formances of all kinds will be doomed
to oblivion on the Stanford campus.

pleted the scenery; the cast have
mastered their lines and their places;
and all that remains is for the di
rector to give the signal that will set
in motion on Saturday night, the
smartest show of the season.
Of course at this time, the show
is not the finished production that it
will be at the time of presentation.
There are many rough edges that will
have t obe cut down and smoothed
awayy. But now, for the first time
since rehearsals started, the continu
ity of the various acts is perfectly
apparent. Coach Seib is confronted
by a very peculiar and difficult prob
lem in the staging of this show, the
solution of which will be watched with
interest by campus dramatic critics.
The trouble does not lie in the coach
ing of the production itself as the tac
tics used here will be commonplace
and conventional enough, but rather
in the organization and management
of the entire show. It is a simple
enough matter to prepare an individu
al act so that it will get over. The
problem is to take ten just such
sketches and so arrange and co-ordin
ate them that they will provide an
interesting evening's entertainment.
The usual mistake in performances
of this nature is the tendency to pro
long the action until the weary audi
ence sneaks out in the middle of the
show, yawning and bored to tears.
This is the common error that Coach
Seib intends to keep out of the Chap
pie Show. Every cue will be snatched
off of the speakers' mouth by the next
one to talk and no opportunity will
be given for the action to lag. There
will be no long delays between scenes
or intermissions, for, while the sets
are being changed, specialty acts will
hold the attention of the audience be
fore the curtain.
If the director manages to accomp
lish these things—and he says he will
—every moment of the "Cheerio"
revue should be characterized by pep
and action. Amateur vaudeville too
often fails because of lack of unity
between the individual acts and too
many unnecessary delays. If these
are successfully obviated in the per
formance Saturday night, Coach Seib
may well congratulate himself on a
distinct departure from the old order
or things. Undoubtedly, the attention
of the campus dramatic will be riveted
on the experiment in the Football
Show. If this experiment fails, spec
tacular revues and vaudeville per
formances of all kinds will be doomed
to oblivion on the Stanford campus.

The time is rapidly drawing near
for Hammer and Coffin to stage their
spectacular Big Game Football Show.
The box office has been opened and
the tickets have gone like hot-cakes;
the costumes have been designed and
are now in the last sttatges of pre
paration; the stagehands have com
pleted the scenery; the cast have
mastered their lines and their places;
and all that remains is for the di

in motion on Saturday night, the
