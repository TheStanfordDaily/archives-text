# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA SERES TO OPEN SOON
## San Francisco Conductor Will Offer Varied Program In First Concert of the Season 
### 
The second season of Symphony con
certs in Stanford University is to open
on Tuesday evening, November 29th,
with the entire organization of eighty
five artists under the direction of Al
fred Hertz. Mr, Hertz has announced
a program for this event which is con
sidered one of the most beautiful ever
played here. It will include the famous
"New World" Symphony by Dvorak,
"The Sorcerer's Apprentice," by Dukas,
one of the cleverest of modern French
writers;" The Roman Carnival," by Ber
lioz, and other interesting compositions.
This course has the support of a large
list of guarantors who are anxious to
cooperate with the Stanford Symphony
Committee in making these concerts an
annual institution at the University with
particular emphasis upon the educa
tional value of these concerts to the
students. There will be two concerts in
the series, the second one to be given on
Tuesday evening, January 10th, and the
season tickets will be on sale by mail for
$2 each, admitting the holder to both
concerts. All seats will be reserved. Ap
plications with checks should be mailed
to the Stanford Symphony Committee,
Box 995, Stanford University.
Inasmuch as these concerts are given
primarily for the benefit of the students,
it is hoped that the students will appre
ciate this privilege and take advantage
in large numbers of the opportunity to
hear one of the finest Symphony or
chestras in the country. The concerts
arc sponsored very largely by the mu
sical organizations of the University, and
these organizations benefit to some ex
tent from whatever surplus is tfsrived
from these concerts. The remaining
surplus is devoted to a fund for carry
ing on concerts of the highest order and
the building up in the future of an an
nual musical festival. Orders for tick
ets may also be placed with members of
the Glee Club, Schubert Club or Or
chestra.
