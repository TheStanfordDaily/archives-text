# CARD WATER POLO TEAM WILL BATTLE OLYMPICS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Coach Brandsten will take his water
polo aggregation to San Francisco to
endeavor to defeat the fast Olympic
junior seven, in the decisive game of
the national junior championships
now being held in the Olympic Club
tank. If Stanford can win tonight's
game, the team is practically assured
of the medals emblematic of the na
tional junior title.
The Olympics, with their faster and
more experienced players, hold a de
cided advantage over the Cardinals.
Brandsten will be well satisfied if his
men can hold their opponents to six
or eight tallies, and get one or two
scores for themselves.
The Stanford seven, even if it loses
the game tonight, will probably be
runners-up in the tournament, as it
has already eliminated the Neptune
Club of Alameda. California is re
garded as out of the race entirely, al
though (he Blue and Gold may spring
a surprise when they play Stanford
next Tuesday.
The Cardinal team will line up as
follows against the Olympics: Strauss,
Drake, and Miller, forwards; Stern
(captain), Austin, and Fletcher, backs;
Greppin, goal.
Interclass competition in water polo
has been postponed until after the
championships and the Big Game.
