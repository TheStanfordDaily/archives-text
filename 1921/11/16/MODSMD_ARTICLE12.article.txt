# BRUINS WILL HAVE WEIGHT ADVANTAGE IN GAME SATURDAY
## Stanford Hope for Victory Seems to Be a Question of Whether or Not Fast Set of Backs Can Get Started 
### 
Figures compiled today on the California-Stanford clash in the stadium
Saturday for the supremacy of the Coast in football, show that Andy Smith's
Bruins will probably have a slight weight advantage in the line.
With the famous "Brick" Muller back at right end, after a long lay-off
through injuries, either Brodie Stephens or Berkey will have to drop off the
"wonder team." And those who have seen little Stephens play this year are in
clined to think Berkey is the player slated to warm the bench.
The weights of the California regulars in the line run as follows: Stephens,
end, 167; Muller, end, 195; Berkey, end, 184; McMillan, tackle, 184; Barnes, tackle,

182; Cranmer, guard, 190; Clark, guard,
195; Latham, center, 194.
â€¢With Muller and Stephens playing the
wings, the Bruin line will average about
187 pounds. The Stanford line, com
| posed of Pershing, Mertz, Carter,
Ludeke, Faville, Betts, and De Groot,
would average approximately 180 pounds.
With Joe Douglas and his 200 pounds
in the line somewhere, the average would
be greater.
The two backfields will be about on a
par, the Cardinals having probably a
slight weight advantage. Captain Pat
rick, Art Wilcox, Bob Shlaudeman, and
Rae Doughty, will complete a backfield
averaging a pound or two under 170.
The Bruins with Erb, Nichols, Toomey
and Nisbet playing will average several
pounds under that. Erb and Toomey
bring down the average, as they weigh
only 154 pounds each.
Aside from the ends, where California
will have a great advantage, as Muller
and Stephens are undoubtedly the best
on the Coast, if not in the country, the
Bruins will not hold much the better of
the argument except in the matter of
substitutes.
Seldom, if ever, has a football team
had such an organization of capable
second-string players as the Bruin var
sity. On the other hand, Gene Van
Gent is hard pressed for such players,
and in case of injuries to any of his
men, particularly in the backfield, the
varsity is bound to be somewhat weak
ened.
In the backfield Andy Smith has
Jimmy Cline, a man who played end two
years ago but who has been crowded
off the team; Dunn, Bell, Morrison and
Van Sant, players who would look good
on any team.
Berkey and Dean are two line men
who played last year but who have been
forced to surrender their positions to
other men. Beam, Schurr, Toney, Gal
lagher and Englebretson are others who
can be thrown into the line without
weakening its power to any great extent.
Stanford's substitutes are good and
have shown to advantage, but they lack
the experience possessed by the Bruin
second-stringers.

As the Big Game nears it looks more
and more to be a question of whether
the fast Cardinal backs can hold their
own against the charging California line,
and as to whether Stanford can outpass
Andy Smith's cohorts. Stanford must
do it to have a chance for victory Sat
urday.
