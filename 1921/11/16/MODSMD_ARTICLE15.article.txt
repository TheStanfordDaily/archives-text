# What of the Stanford Eleven?
## 
### 
Daily papers are full of the wonders of the Cali
fornia varsity. We are told of their wonderful ends,
their great field general, the man who hoots the pig
skin seventy yards, and the fellow who passes the
ball fifty-six yards in competition. Critics and sport
ing writers concede or rather acclaim it to be the
most wonderful combination of football players on
the continent.
Stanford, we learn, has a fighting organization.
The eleven that will face this world-beating aggre
gation is imbued with the famous Stanford Spirit.
They will fight. Most certainly they will fight. But
is that all that Stanford has? Are there no stars in
the lineup? Are there no men who can be counted
upon to do the unusual, the spectacular? Men who
have football brains and real gridiron ability?
Most assuredly there are, and it is about time that
the public in general and Stanford followers in par
ticular cognizance of the fact. Look over the
list of men who will uphold the honor of the Cardi
nal in the struggle with the Golden Grizzlies next
Saturday. What of our field general, our fighting
line and slashing backfield? How do they compare
man for man with their opponents? A careful analy
sis will show that man for man they compare favor
ably with the men they will encounter. Why, then,
keep silent alxnit them?
Stanford has not run true to form in any con
test played this season. By form we mean that
they did not follow the predictions of the knowing.
Rather, they upset the dope in each and every game
of the season. St. Mary's and the Olympic Club
elevens were both picked to win from the Cardinal.
They lost. Washington and Nevada were both
named as losers, but they played Stanford to tie
scores. Now Stanford is doped to be easy for the
California eleven. There is every reason to believe
that the dope will be upset in this, the last and big
gest contest of the season.
Think it over and you will realize that Stanford
is not in for a beating next Saturday, but that
California is going to have to fight every minute of
jthe game before it can prove supremacy. When you
have doped it out to suit yourself start then to tell
the portion of the world that you encounter that
San ford lias a real football team.
