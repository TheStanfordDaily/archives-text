The l)onfire around which all of the men of the
student body will rally on Thursday night as a cli
max; to the greatest pep gathering of the year is
now practically completed. To the first-year men of
Stanford must he given the credit for constructing
the enormous pile on which the self-confidence of
Berkeley will he scorched and then destroyed, and
from whose flames Stanford spirit will be revivified
if such a thing is possible.
The freshmen have worked hard to erect this
pyre, and that is a pleasant sign. Men who have been
here but a short time, some for one complete quar
ter, and others for just seven weeks, have already
acquired the Stanford way of doing things. Theirs
is the spirit that without an undue amount of urging
by upperclassmen has made a sacrifice of time and
exhibited conscientiousness in putting in full time
and more on the erection of the Ixnifire. The Babes
are to be commended on their work during the past
week, and it is to be hoped that the spirit they have
manifested these past few days will not die out fol
lowing the great event of the year, the Big Game, for
there is wide field here for such hearty willingness.
Sophomores who were in charge of the work dem
onstrated that they have not lost any of the effects
of their first-year training. Those who actually su
pervised the job worked even harder than the fresh

men and some put in as many as ninety hours in
directing construction.
Such sacrifices are seldom noticed by the students
at large and less often are they properly accredited.
When the great mass falls tomorrow night and the
last glowing embers are slowly blinking out it will
be well to remember that only through the co-opera
tion and collaboration of the freshmen and Sopho
mores was it made possible. Such a thought will not
be amiss.
