# The 						Disarmament Conference.
## 
### 
An anxious world is watching, waiting. Like a
man that has walked along the edge of dangerous
chasms in his delirium, and whose suddenly return
ing consciousness has brought him, trembling and
afraid, to a realization of the dangers which sur
round him, the world in desperation realizes the
peril which confronts mankind.
War, always horrible, has reached a stage where
it no longer is confined to activity on the part of
armies. The war of the future does not mean the
loss of a few thousand soldiers, it means the annihi
lation of whole peoples. Wars' effect, as has been
demonstrated in the last conflict, is felt by every in
dividual in the most ordinary roles of life.
The world realizes that mankind, to exist, must in
some manner settle those problems that breed war,
and must agree, as nations, to cease that hostile
preparation in time of peace which causes every
people to regard its neighbor as a potential enemy.
The Disarmament Conference now sitting in
Washington has been called into being to effect that
end. Preliminary reports indicate that its high mis
sion will be successful. As college students, as men
and women who will soon take leadership in the life
of out nation, we are glad that the United States is
inaugurating this move, which we believe is destined
to bring the world up from the abyss in which the
shadow of war hides all, into the golden sunlight of
peace and understanding between all men.
Tomorrow, as members of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, will be called upon
to make a formal expression of our high hopes for
the success of this conference, which means so much
to each of us. Other students in other institutions
all over the land will at the same time express their
hope for permanent peace through the limitation of
armaments. t
Stanford has always stood for democracy. Every
man is placed on his merits, and each is given his
opportunity. We believe that nations must adopt
tl*is attribute of Stanford, this spirit of mutual equal
ity and mutual fair dealing. In adopting the reso
lution which has been prepared, we will only be
another expression of that spirit.
In the mining camps of the early days of Cali
fornia. each individual carried a small arsenal with
which he protected "his rights." Small disputes be
tween men invited ready reference to bullets as ar
biters.
So it is with nations. Two or more nations, each
with tremendous military and naval power, find op
portunity to use that power on other nations whose
viewpoint on international questions is not the same
as their own.
The old days of the highly armed frontiersman
have passed forever into history. The reign of the
pistol and the rifle has ceased, and the common un
derstanding of the individual, reenforcecl by the law,
has assumed its place.
If nations now holding their power through huge
armies and tremendous navies will eliminate mutual
fear by scrapping their weapons of aggression, and
will substitute for them education and mutual under
standing, there will be less occasion for the shedding
of blood, the killing of our fellow beings.
The Washington Conference, through a reduction
in naval force, will take the first step toward placing
nations on the same footing as the man without
guns, who, nevertheless, is secure from the encroach
ments of his neighbor. Through mutual and open
discussion of the problems of many peoples, an un
understanding between nations in which war has no
place is possible.
We hope, we pray for this possibility.

pistol and the rifle has ceased, and the common un
derstanding of the individual, reenforcecl by the law,
has assumed its place.
If nations now holding their power through huge
armies and tremendous navies will eliminate mutual
fear by scrapping their weapons of aggression, and
will substitute for them education and mutual under
standing, there will be less occasion for the shedding
of blood, the killing of our fellow beings.
The Washington Conference, through a reduction
in naval force, will take the first step toward placing
nations on the same footing as the man without
guns, who, nevertheless, is secure from the encroach
ments of his neighbor. Through mutual and open
discussion of the problems of many peoples, an un
understanding between nations in which war has no
place is possible.
We hope, we pray for this possibility.
An anxious world is watching, waiting. Like a
man that has walked along the edge of dangerous
chasms in his delirium, and whose suddenly return
ing consciousness has brought him, trembling and
afraid, to a realization of the dangers which sur
round him, the world in desperation realizes the
peril which confronts mankind.
War, always horrible, has reached a stage where
it no longer is confined to activity on the part of
armies. The war of the future does not mean the
loss of a few thousand soldiers, it means the annihi
lation of whole peoples. Wars' effect, as has been
demonstrated in the last conflict, is felt by every in
dividual in the most ordinary roles of life.
The world realizes that mankind, to exist, must in
some manner settle those problems that breed war,
and must agree, as nations, to cease that hostile
preparation in time of peace which causes every
people to regard its neighbor as a potential enemy.
The Disarmament Conference now sitting in
Washington has been called into being to effect that
end. Preliminary reports indicate that its high mis
sion will be successful. As college students, as men
and women who will soon take leadership in the life
of out nation, we are glad that the United States is
inaugurating this move, which we believe is destined
to bring the world up from the abyss in which the
shadow of war hides all, into the golden sunlight of
peace and understanding between all men.
Tomorrow, as members of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, will be called upon
to make a formal expression of our high hopes for
the success of this conference, which means so much
to each of us. Other students in other institutions
all over the land will at the same time express their
hope for permanent peace through the limitation of
armaments. t
Stanford has always stood for democracy. Every
man is placed on his merits, and each is given his
opportunity. We believe that nations must adopt
tl*is attribute of Stanford, this spirit of mutual equal
ity and mutual fair dealing. In adopting the reso
lution which has been prepared, we will only be
another expression of that spirit.
In the mining camps of the early days of Cali
fornia. each individual carried a small arsenal with
which he protected "his rights." Small disputes be
tween men invited ready reference to bullets as ar
biters.
So it is with nations. Two or more nations, each
with tremendous military and naval power, find op
portunity to use that power on other nations whose
viewpoint on international questions is not the same
as their own.
The old days of the highly armed frontiersman
have passed forever into history. The reign of the
