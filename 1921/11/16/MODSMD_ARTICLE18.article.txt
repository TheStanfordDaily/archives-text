We offer the following simple example for the
simpler students:
• * *
A. History.—Do not bother to remember dates. Make
a picture of a bucket of rutabagas being dumped into
a safety deposit box. The combination of the box,
minus 237, will correspond with the date, and thus un
necessary trouble is avoided.
* * *
B. Chemistry.—To avoid remembering the letters of a
formula, think of the rush hour at Powell and Market.
A comparison of the figures displayed by car lines of
each letter will give the correct formula.
• * *
C. Economic Rent. —Make a picture of a Venetian
junk-man collecting round shoestrings for the sphagettl
trade. The marginal utility of the brown laces over
the black will give the correct answer without further
thought.
* * *
D. Torts. Case of Smith vs. Smith—decision in favor
of Smith.—This is very simple. Make a picture of an
Eskimo life-guard being tanned by the midnight sun.
At this point the situation becomes clear, and you will
have no trouble in remembering why the judge took a
ten-minute recess when the evidence was brought in.
