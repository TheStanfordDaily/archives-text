# SOPHOMORE WOMEN TO PLAY U. C. FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Women of the freshman hockey
squad were given another chance yes
terday afternoon to represent the Uni
versity at an intercollegiate compe
tition, when they met the sophomore
team, the representative of the under
class women' in the Mills game last
Saturday. If they had showed as
much pep and determination to win
in the first half of the game as they
did in the last, the score might have
been in their favor, but the sopho
mores ran up six points in the first
interval which the freshmen, although
they kept the '24 class from scoring
in the second, were unable to equal.
Laura Webb, '25, proved herself the
leading member on her team, fulfilling
her duties as fullback without fail and
showing, along with individual play, a
thorough knowledge of teamwork.
Carol Kliilk, '25, dribbled well, and
scored. Doris Harter, '25, played a
fast game throughout and shot the
second and last goal for the fresh
men.
The sophomores will again be un
derclass women entries and will meet
the California freshmen next Satur
day morning, on the Stanford field.
"The chances for winning are good,"
said Miss Edith Pasmore, of the Phy
scial Education department. "The
teams will be evenly matched."
Both squads have held their senior
sisters to a tie in preliminaries and
the prospects for a real hard fight next
Saturday are apparent. The '24's
came through with their usual co
operation and quick game play. The
halves again showed up strong In the
defense and fast in passes. Grace
Strobel shot the first goal for the
sophomores in the first five minutes
of play. Josephine Franklin and Isa
bel Muzzey broke through the fresh
man line for two more. Constance
Tamplin and Isabelle Muzzey brought
the score up to six at the end of the
first half. The final score was 6 to
2 in favor of the sophomores. The
'24 team will probably lose an ex
perienced fullback for the California
game, in Margaret Mackey, who
wrenched and possibly sprained her
ankle in this preliminary. The junior
team will meet the seniors this after
noon. A close game is expected,
