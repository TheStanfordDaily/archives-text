# JOHN NEIHARDT TALKS AT TUESDAY LECTURE
## Nebraskan Epic Poet Presents His Theories of Poetry and Education Now in Existence 
### 
"The ony thing democratic about free
j verse is that each individual can pro
| duce his own poetry for home con
; sumption. The only thing that I ask
! is that it he consumed at home," said
John G. Neihardt, the poet, last night in
his lecture on "Poetry and Education,"
which he gave in the Little Theater.
i This was the same talk which he gave
when he was officially made Poet Lau
reate of Nebraska last year.
Neihardt opened his lecture with his
I ideas of what education should consist.
"Practical education, as it is generally
| considered," he said, "is the mental
i training which will enable the individ
ual to gain the maximum income in the
minimum time. This is using the mate
rial scale of values, the scale of the
brute. The prime function of education
is to make men social beings, to make
them citizens of all times and ages, and
to develop a race sympathy and con
sciousness. Education is an endless
process. World literature should be
studied to bring this about.
"Happiness is the harmonious adjust
ment of man in the world of men and
tilings. What could be less than to spend
the time in acquiring the means of life
and forgetting to live and be happy? If
poetry had no utilitarian justification in
this scientific age, I would say that the
poets should be put to some more useful
work, but poetry is the device for com
municating human experiences with an
emotional approximation of the inex
pressible."
Poetry is the essence of suggestion,
he explained. There is something sub
tle and powerful which moves among the
dry bones of verbs and nouns which
make up the language. Language is in
adequate and the restless, gleaning soul
of man is constanting groping for un
der meanings and ideas. "Poetry is
economy of human expression."
Neihardt took up the four devices
which poetry uses to convey its inex
pressible shades of meaning. The first
of these is symbolism, which gives
meanings to words which will not be
found in dictionaries, and to understand
them one must be familiar with the ver
bal overtones of a language. The sec
ond device is rythm. "That which is
not symmetrical is not efficient and can
not endure. In free form verse there
is no rythm and therefore no symmetry.
Rhymes and rythmic patterns are va
rious sources of artistic freedom and
are not constraining as many modern
poets claim. Rythm produces a mood
of understanding and has an hypnotic
effect.
"Anomatopoeia or the manipulations
of sounds gives a subtler rythm. This

is done by the use of the caesura and
the recurrence of vowel and consonnant
sounds in the same line." By this means
poetry may, purely by sound, give the
impression which its words convey.
The fourth device of poetry is the
appeal to the memory. "Poets which ap
peal to the memory of the individual
are minor poets. Those who appeal to
the memory of the race are major poets.
Most people lack race memory and this
accounts for the popularity of men like
Riley and Edgar Guest.
"I believe that the world has entered
upon one of the most important epochs
of poetry since the revival of learning

in Elizabethan England. Our poets,""
Neihardt concluded, "will achieve the
objective view of men and thijigs and it
is out of that view that all great things
of life grow."
Neihardt is the author of a large num
ber of volumes of poetry and has been
working for seven years upon an epic
cycle of life of the American Northwest.
This will contain five poems, two of
which are already published. They are
"The Song of Hugh Glass" and "The
Song of Three Friends."

"Anomatopoeia or the manipulations
of sounds gives a subtler rythm. This

is done by the use of the caesura and
the recurrence of vowel and consonnant
sounds in the same line." By this means
poetry may, purely by sound, give the
impression which its words convey.
The fourth device of poetry is the
appeal to the memory. "Poets which ap
peal to the memory of the individual
are minor poets. Those who appeal to
the memory of the race are major poets.
Most people lack race memory and this
accounts for the popularity of men like
Riley and Edgar Guest.
"I believe that the world has entered
upon one of the most important epochs
of poetry since the revival of learning

in Elizabethan England. Our poets,""
Neihardt concluded, "will achieve the
objective view of men and thijigs and it
is out of that view that all great things
of life grow."
Neihardt is the author of a large num
ber of volumes of poetry and has been
working for seven years upon an epic
cycle of life of the American Northwest.
This will contain five poems, two of
which are already published. They are
"The Song of Hugh Glass" and "The
Song of Three Friends."
"The ony thing democratic about free
j verse is that each individual can pro
| duce his own poetry for home con
; sumption. The only thing that I ask
! is that it he consumed at home," said
John G. Neihardt, the poet, last night in
his lecture on "Poetry and Education,"
which he gave in the Little Theater.
i This was the same talk which he gave
when he was officially made Poet Lau
reate of Nebraska last year.
Neihardt opened his lecture with his
I ideas of what education should consist.
"Practical education, as it is generally
| considered," he said, "is the mental
i training which will enable the individ
ual to gain the maximum income in the
minimum time. This is using the mate
rial scale of values, the scale of the
brute. The prime function of education
is to make men social beings, to make
them citizens of all times and ages, and
to develop a race sympathy and con
sciousness. Education is an endless
process. World literature should be
studied to bring this about.
"Happiness is the harmonious adjust
ment of man in the world of men and
tilings. What could be less than to spend
the time in acquiring the means of life
and forgetting to live and be happy? If
poetry had no utilitarian justification in
this scientific age, I would say that the
poets should be put to some more useful
work, but poetry is the device for com
municating human experiences with an
emotional approximation of the inex
pressible."
Poetry is the essence of suggestion,
he explained. There is something sub
tle and powerful which moves among the
dry bones of verbs and nouns which
make up the language. Language is in
adequate and the restless, gleaning soul
of man is constanting groping for un
der meanings and ideas. "Poetry is
economy of human expression."
Neihardt took up the four devices
which poetry uses to convey its inex
pressible shades of meaning. The first
of these is symbolism, which gives
meanings to words which will not be
found in dictionaries, and to understand
them one must be familiar with the ver
bal overtones of a language. The sec
ond device is rythm. "That which is
not symmetrical is not efficient and can
not endure. In free form verse there
is no rythm and therefore no symmetry.
Rhymes and rythmic patterns are va
rious sources of artistic freedom and
are not constraining as many modern
poets claim. Rythm produces a mood
of understanding and has an hypnotic
effect.
