# SOPHOMORE PLAY CHARACTERS ARE ANNOUNCED TODAY
## Norris James, Helen Whitney, Edythe Bailis, Have Parts In "You Never Can Tell" 
### 
The cast to which the sophomore
class will entrust its coming production
of "You Never Can Tell," has been an
nounced today by Coach Gordon Davis.
Norris James, as Mr. Valentine; Helen
Whitney in the part of Dolly Clandon,
and Edythe Bailis as Miss Gloria Clan
don have been selected for the heaviest
parts and will be supported by John

Richer as Mr. Compton, Daniel D. Gage
as Mr. McComas, John O. Vaughn as
Phillip Clandon, and Samuel Menden
hall in the character part of William.
Catherine Ulrich as Mrs. Clandon and
Constance Tamplin as the maid will in
terpret the other feminine roles.
The previous work of the cast having
been confined to one year, there is op
portunity for considerable speculation
as to the way in which these parts will
be handled, and the success with which
they will be developed. James appears
for the first time on the campus stage,
although he has had previous expe
rience. Both Vaughn and Mendenhall
have been in Ram's Head and junior
opera productions during their fresh
man year, and Gage took part in the
"Yellow Jacket."
Helen Whitney, although she has
made no previous appearance on the
Assembly Hall stage, is familiar to local
audiences through her work in the "Tent
of the Arabs," produced last year, and
also in the "Heart of Pierrot," given
this summer at the Fleishhacker home
and later at Castilleja, in which she
won much commendation, especially for
her dancing. Her part in "You Never
Can Tell" will give her an opportunity
to make use of her training in this
field.
Although this will also be the first
entry into college dramatics of Edythe
Baillis, she comes with a considerable
record and has had much special train
ing. Catherine Ulrich and Constance
Teinplin will also be given opportunity
to establish tWemselves in local dra
matics. The part of Mr. Bohun will be
announced at a later date.
With the necessity of changing the
sophomore play from "A Thousand
Years Ago" to "You Never Can Tell,"
the standards of selections were also
changed. Consequently the cast select
ed for the former play was somewhat
altered to suit the new requirements,
and rather than selecting some of the
original characters for minor parts in
the second play, thereby preventing
them from participating in more than
one other production during the year,
they were not cast for "You Never Can
Tell."
