### 
Tomorrow night the annual Big Game
rally will hold sway in the Assembly
Hall, followed by the bonfire, which will
take pace opposite the power-house
where the freshman class has erected
a huge tangled mass of lumber, trees
and scraps of wood collected from all
over the southern end of the peninsula.
With only a limited number of seats
in the Assembly Hall, student rooters
must get tickets for the big rally from
the office of the registrar before tomor
row afternoon at 4 o'clock. Only those
holding tickets will be admitted to the
rally. Following the regular custom, all
seniors and holdovers will guard the
bonfire during the rally. This will give
all underclassmen an opportunity to be
present.
The rally will start at 7 o'clock when
Assistant Yell Leader Douglas will lead
die march down the row of all frater
nity men. He will start at the Sigma
Nu house and lead his group to the As
sembly Hall, where he will be joined
by the members of Sequoia Hall, led
by Assistant Yell Leader Minsky, and
Encina Hall under the charge of Yell
Leader Connolly.
Shortly after the rooters are assem
bled in the . hall, the varsity squad will

lowed inside of the Assembly Hall at

is the result of an agreement made with

sembly Hall still testify to the thought
lessness of some over-enthusiastic root
er at last year's rally.
