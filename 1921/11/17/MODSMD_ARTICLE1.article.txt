# MYSTERY VEILS MOVES OF BOTH CARDS. BRUINS
## Lineups to Clash in Stadium Saturday Yet Unannounced â€”Both Coaches in Silence 
### 
With mystery veiling every move of
Gene Van Gent and his Stanford var
sity this week and the same state
of affairs existing over on the Cali
fornia held, football fans can only
guess what is going on with both
squads.
The Cardinals will take the field
Saturday, regarded as a sure loser by
the crowd which will gather in the
new Stanford stadium. There can be
no doubt of that. But dope is as
nothing in football and history may
repeat itself. Back in 1905 when the
present Stanford field was opened, the
Cardinal was not given a chance of
winning. But they won.
Van Gent's team has been an in
and outer all season but at least it
has never opened up. If one takes
the Stanford-Washington and the Cali
fornia-Washington games as a basis
for this dope, it looks bad. Bagshaw's
team tied Stanford but lost the fol
lowing week to Andy Smith's team
72 to 3. From the Oregon Aggie game
it looks much better.
Stanford outfought the Aggies and
won 14 to 7. Yet the Aggies held
Washington State to a 7 to 3 score
and California had to use its greatest
strength to wrest a 14 to 0 win from
W. S. C.
The Cards will have their full
strength on deck against the Bruins
for the first time since the early sea
son. Art Wilcox who played only a
few minutes at Seattle and who was
on the sidelines all during last Sat
urday's Nevada affair, will be in ac
tion. He is in the best of shape. Bob
Shlaudeman, "Scotch" Campbell, "Red"
Betts and "Kewp" Sproull are others
who will be ready for the big game.
With the year's football classic only
two days away, interest in the game
has increased accordingly. Every
where Stanford "ts only * accorded a
bare fighting chance. Most of the
bets that will be placed, if there will
be any, will be on the score, not on
the results of the game itself.
But Gene Van Gent and Captain
Jack Patrick have expressed them
selves as ready to send the varsity
against California not with the in
tention of keeping the score drwn,
but of winning. That would leai to
the belief that the Cardinals will use
trick plays and open work Satu day.
It can mean nothing else. California's
powerful line, consisting of men who
have played on the same team for
for four years, some of them even in
high school has resisted every attack
through it for two seasons.
Stanford's hope seems to line in
open work where her fast backs will
always be dangerous. Van Gent's
men have scored on every team this
year except Washington, and there is
reason to believe they will score on
the "wonder team." The rest then
would put it on the Card linemen who
must withstand the charges of Nisbet
through the line and drop Nichols and
Toomey on their end runs.
