Last night the Hammer and Coffin
football show went through its pre
liminary dress rehearsal—and survived.
As usual, though, in all such cases, there
were numerous interruptions and altera
tions and the whole cast went home de
voutly wishing that they had never set
foot upon the Stanford stage. Today
the members of the cast, wearied by
intensive rehearsing, are enjoying a
brief respite in preparation for the final
dress rehearsal to be held tomorrow
night on the eve of the formal presenta
tion of the show to the campus public.
The "Cheeri-0 Revue" is so compre
hensive and contains so many really
good numbers, that it is difficult in this
very limited space to attempt to do any
of them justice. Exactly the same thing
is true of the cast itself. There are so
many individual stars appearing in this
production that a careful enumeration of
their various charms and capabilities
would be out of the question. But it is
possible to choose at random from the
cast some of the more noted or strik
ing of the characters.
Donaldine Cameron, well known hero
ine of campus dramatic productions,
again plays the lead in a comedy playlet
entitled, "The Blue Envelope." With the
beauty for which she has long been fa
mous ; her reasonable amount of dra
matic ability; and the strong support of
a well-balanced cast, she should succeed
in putting the sketch over.
This football show will also serve as
a means of introduction for a new
comer into the University field of dra
matics. Edythe Bayliss has been one of
the finds of this year's show, and great
things are expected of her. She has
been cast in a responsible and difficult
part and gives promise of living up to
all expectations of the director in
charge.
Among the most prominent male leads
in the show, stands Jack HefFernan in
the role of Old Chappie himself. It is
quite possible for the observer, as lie
watches Heffernan jest his way merriy
through the prologue, to imagine that
the Old Boy has just stepped out from
between the pages of his birthplace and
home —the "Chaarral." Heffernan is
certainly an ideal Chappie and deserves
credit for the cleverness with which he
handles the part.
Paul Clallin. as droll and quaintly
humorous as ever, will be on hand to
help drive the troubles away.
Nelson Valjean does an excellent
piece of character work in the playlet
entitled, "The Freedom of the Press."
