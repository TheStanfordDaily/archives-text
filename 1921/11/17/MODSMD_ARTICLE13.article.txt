# Another Act of Vandalism.
## 
### 
Irresponsibles have again painted the big "C" on
Charter Hill at Berkeley. It is our belief that this
act was committed by persons who are not connected'
in any way with this institution. The question of the
invasion of campuses has been thoroughly discussed
here, and the principles involved in the agreement
between California and Stanford are understood.
It is our belief that loyalty to Stanford principles
makes the commission of such an act by any Stanford
man or group impossible.
The deed has been committed, and it is now the
duty of every student in this institution to do all
that he can to clear the name of Stanford. Coming
just at this time before the Big Game opinion on the
outside is that the act was committed by Stanford
students. For his reason everyone connected witl)
the University is bound to do all that he can t6
establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Stanford
was in no way connected with the commission of
the act. This, we are certain, will be found to be
the case. The University of California can count on
our complete co-operation.
We are more interested than they in seeing that
the vandals are ferreted out so that they can be dealt
with properly.
We would advise that everyone practice a little
on sign language today, for it will be mighty difficult
to talk tomorrow.
