Every rooting section ticket is marked for a par
ticular seat. It is the aim of those in charge of the
section to have every ticketholder occupy the seat
which his ticket calls for. In the past it has been
customary to occupy the seats without regard to the
numl>er on the stubs. A late comer was always
placed at a disadvantage, and oftentimes confusion
resulted from someone trying to claim the seat he
was rightfully entitled to.
To avoid confusion Stanford rooters will be di
rected to the seats to which their ticket entitles them,
and police in charge of the section will see that seat
claimants who come in late receive their proper seats.
