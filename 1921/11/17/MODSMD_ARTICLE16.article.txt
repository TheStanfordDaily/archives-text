# Obeying Instructions.
## 
### 
To those few who were not present at the Sta
dium rally yesterday afternoon, a word as to the
procedure on Saturday afternoon in the rooting sec
tion may be helpful. The most important thing will
be to follow explicitly the directions given out by
the yell-leaders. Connolly has already announced
certain details. Sacks of confetti will be found upon

every seat in the rooting section. The confetti must
be carefully guarded until the word is given to
scatter it. A new system of changing hats has been
devised. Cards on every seat will contain instruc
tions for the different stunts, and every rooter should
be certain beforehand just what his part is to be.
Every cog in Stanford's rooting machine must be
working smoothly and swiftly Saturday afternoon
to maintain the reputation that Cardinal rooters have
established in the past. C. S. S.
