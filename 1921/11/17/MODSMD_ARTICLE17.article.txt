HORATIO TO THE BRIDGE
—or —
Patience Rewarded
Horatious (Speaking in dead earnest —even the tone
is low).
"Oh, Imogene, with eyes of blue,
My burning love's insured for you.
You are my heart, my life, my pride,
For you I'd cast my wife aside.
I'd even jump from this high height,
If I believed I'd never light.
But, hark, what enemy is near?
Just step in front a moment, dear,
My shoestring's loose and I must fight
These ghastly shadows of the night.
'Come one, come all, you hounds of Hell;
I'll fight you all who are not well.'
He dashed headlong to the fray.
The vision fades and melts away.
And as he comes from slumber sound
He sees, instead, white masks around.
The bridge is nothing but his bed,
Of course, his Imogene is fled,
And white-robed men alone remain.
Horatius hears with sudden pain,
The words, 'Go get a towel, you frosh.
You're bound for Roble Bridge, b'gosh.' "
—Mac Henry.
* * *
The foregoing example of the evils of welch-rarebit
leads the list of items the dispatcher is thankful for.
At least, one correspondent realizes that the dispatcher
is the logical receiver of dispatches. Let's go!
* * *
A Cake Eater
It's something that's so cute and so neat,
A very small tie and patent leather feet;
A part in his hair, and pants pressed so,
Crumbs in his pocket instead of dough;
A small black derby and a cute pair of spats,
Goes to a dance and thinks he's the cat's.
Stands on the floor like a lily so pure,
When some silly girl comes along and says, "Sure!"
She thinks he's so loveley, and he acts so refined;
They get on the car, and she pays the dime.
Now listen here girls—you may like their ties,
But remember our ma's married regular guys!
—I. HATEM.

Customer:.. Anything at all as long as they have no
laces. I want my shoes without laces.
Clerk: Sorry, sir. We're all out of laced shoes. I
can have the buttons taken off another pair, though.

And:
Across the Hall
"No more beer."
"No?"
"No more wine."
. "No!"
"No more booze of any kind."
"Well, for "
"No more anything but work and study
from now on."
(Sigh of relief). "Now I don't believe a
word of it."

Being about time for some real entertainment, behold
the following picking from the Cornell Sun's "Berry
Patch."

We actually believe she does, at that.

These from a bird that labels them "In Class." Some

PHILOSOPHY
He quotes from Aritophane's "Frog,"
While all the bookish hear agog,
Though all the rest drowse noisily
Till twelve o'clock shall set us free,
From modulation of his voice
We see he thinks his wit is choice,
So when he pauses we all weep
With joy—and settle back to rleep.
Two minutes more! The shuffling feet
And snapping books drown out his bleat;
On edge of seats, irate as Hell,
All wait the clanging of the bell.
* * *
That sounds philosophical, Peer Us.
* * »
Give attention and you shall list
To the ravings of an euphimist.
The fish are singing in the trees
O, hear the barking of the bees
As they climb in the boughs of the slush
sluff bush,
And join in Nature's noisy hush.
Oh, O, how sweet the world doth seem;
Satisfying—like a Freudian dream.
—Poer Us.
* * *
That's enough. We know you now, Chesterfield.
* * *
Supposing we all quit.
♦ * *
IT'S JUST AS THE GARTER SAID—WE'VE GONE
QUITE A STRETCH TQ,DAY.

HORATIO TO THE BRIDGE
—or —
Patience Rewarded
Horatious (Speaking in dead earnest —even the tone
is low).
"Oh, Imogene, with eyes of blue,
My burning love's insured for you.
You are my heart, my life, my pride,
For you I'd cast my wife aside.
I'd even jump from this high height,
If I believed I'd never light.
But, hark, what enemy is near?
Just step in front a moment, dear,
My shoestring's loose and I must fight
These ghastly shadows of the night.
'Come one, come all, you hounds of Hell;
I'll fight you all who are not well.'
He dashed headlong to the fray.
The vision fades and melts away.
And as he comes from slumber sound
He sees, instead, white masks around.
The bridge is nothing but his bed,
Of course, his Imogene is fled,
And white-robed men alone remain.
Horatius hears with sudden pain,
The words, 'Go get a towel, you frosh.
You're bound for Roble Bridge, b'gosh.' "
—Mac Henry.

A Cake Eater
It's something that's so cute and so neat,
A very small tie and patent leather feet;
A part in his hair, and pants pressed so,
Crumbs in his pocket instead of dough;
A small black derby and a cute pair of spats,
Goes to a dance and thinks he's the cat's.
Stands on the floor like a lily so pure,
When some silly girl comes along and says, "Sure!"
She thinks he's so loveley, and he acts so refined;
They get on the car, and she pays the dime.
Now listen here girls—you may like their ties,
But remember our ma's married regular guys!
