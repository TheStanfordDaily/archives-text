To the Editor of the Daily Palo
Alto: —With the approach of the Big
Game the question of the betting evil
conies to one's attention. Stanford is
out to win the Big Game. Everyone
expresses confidence that we will win.
Nowadays one may be asked by some
U. C. supporter what his money says
about the game. A man believes in
our team and wants to make his
money, so, so. But does his money
bet on the game talk for Stanford,
support Stanford. It does not.
Stripped of all its camouflage this
is what the betting transaction in
volves: one expects to make a certain
sum of money if Stanford wins, and
will pay a like sum of money to the
U. C. supporter if we are beaten, say,
14 points.
The first wrong in the transaction
is that the men who bet are breaking
the law of the State. They will give,
if Berkeley beats us, aid nad comfort
to our enemy. Betting is a corrupt
form of sport, and in encouraging
betting one helps to corrupt sport.
Whoever does this can rightly be call
ed our enemy. They expect to profit
by the efforts of their pals on the
field. They brand thmselves by the
transaction as lawbreaekers, traitors,
and bloodsuckers.
The factor of money bet on the
games does not make one's support
any stronger unless one will root
harder with the idea before of winning
or loosing money.
Our men are out to fight, fight
and win for Stanford. By betting on
the game a man knnifes them in the
back. Anyone betting on the game
insults oneself, loyaytl, law and Stan
ford spirit. Don't let any one make

the "S" into a dollar sign.

Let every red-blooded man condemn
the betting on the Big Game or even
conversation about betting wherever
he may hear it. Let the University
authorities and students co-operate to

stop betting from corrupting our
sports.
Let every one of us support our
team because it is a Stanford team
made up of Stanford men, with the
Stanford Spirit to win against oddß.
