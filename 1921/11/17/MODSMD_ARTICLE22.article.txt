# MS. J. W. MITCHELL TELLS OF RED CROSS WORK IN PALO ALTO
## 
### 
"In giving a report of the actual work
of the Red Cross for the last year, we
give all that is necessary as propaganda
for this, its hfth annual roll call," said
Mrs. J. W. Mitchell, managing director
of the Palo Alto Chapter, in an inter
view concerning the drive which will be
held on the campus on Monday and
Tuesday of next week.
"Funds for the Red Cross are divided
equally between national and local or
ganizations. Of the overseas relief
work, of the teeding and clothing ox
starving children, little need be said.
Less spectacular but equally as vital is
the work carried on in individual ciiap
ters. The Palo Alto section divides its
efforts among three main branches:
Home Service, Home Service Extension,
and Federal Board Vocational Educa
tion. Under the first two heads come
the care of wives and children of dis
charged soldiers at the hospitals whose
compensations have been delayed or are
under adjustment, and the aid in local
emergency cases where the recipients
have no claim on other organizations.
Offices of the Federal Board are main
tained in the Administration building,
at Stanford, and here the Red Cross
loans funds to the men at the University
receiving delayed support from the gov
ernment."
In speaking of the coming roll call
and campaign on the campus, Mrs.
Mitchell stated that in all there were
some $6,000 used last year in merely
local relief, "if the necessary total of
approximately $14,000 is to be collected,
it means that there must be a 100 per
cent response. Especially is the Uni
versity, which has always supported us
so heartily before, asked to respond this
year with a sum representing its entire
campus population."
