# SEQUOIA MEN HOLD CALIFORNIA'S WAKE
## 
### 
Unrestrained enthusiasm and pep
marked the passing of the second an
nual Sequoia wake last night at 7:30.
The wake was featured by a huge brown
bear, that was about to fall under the
hatchet of a doughty Indian brave. The
coffin for California also figured con
spicuously in the parade.
The parade left Sequoia Hall and
proceeded directly to the Delta Upsilon
house, where the varsity is training.
Here the mourners forgot their grief
long enough to give several cheers for
the team. Captain Jack Patrick plunged
the mourners into even deeper grief by
telling them how Stanford was going to
bury California on the 19th of No
vember.
Roble Hall, the various houses on the
row, and Encina Hall were all given a
chance to join in the mourning, and
then the large coffin was carried to the
fire to await cremation on rally night.
Sequoia Hall was granted the right
to make this wake an annual affair by
the executive committee, to be held on
the evening of Roughs' day.
The committee in charge of the wake
was: Art Tyler, Newton Brinkham, Ray
Law, and Lewis Pcnwell.
