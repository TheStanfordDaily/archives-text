# CLASS OF 1922 WILL BE HOST AT DANCE ON FRIDAY EVENING
## 
### 
On the eve of the Big Game the sen
ior class will be hosts at a dance to be
given at the Women's Clubhouse on the
campus as a means of entertaining the
student body and the large number of
alumni and visitors that will arrive at
Stanford from now on. The fact that
the committee in charge obtained the
services of Whitmer's orchestra for the
evening will itself be a very important
matter in making the evening's enter
tainment a great success. The price of
the dance has been set at $1.10 per
couple. The dance will form a sort of
a "get-together" between many of the
old graduates and their former college
pals as well as affording the present
college undergraduates an opportunity
to become acquainted with former Stan
fordites.
