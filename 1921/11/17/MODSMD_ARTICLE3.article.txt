# FIRST STADIUM RALLY DRAWS LARGE CROWD
## 
### 
Led by the music of the Stanford
band, the "Roughs" had the honor of
being the first group to parade in the
new Stanford stadium. The unshaven
and oddly attired Stanfordites marched
about the track to gain the approval of
the women, who turned out nearly 100
per cent to this, the first stadium rally.
After the Roughs had been shot by the
many cameras and moving picture ma
chines, they lodged themselves in the
location where Stanford's rooting sec
tion will be during the Big Game.
It was estimated by several that over
2,200 people lent their voices to the
singing and rooting of the afternoon.
The activities started off with the women
in a rooting contest against the law
majors. For purposes of safety it was
decided not to make a decision as to
the winner of the contest. Several other
contests were held. Final instructions
concerning the rooting section during
the Big Game were given out by the
yell leaders. Every one was notified to
obtain a new style rooters hat in order
to be allowed to sit in the rooting sec
tion. All the people in the rooting sec
tion were requested to wear white shirts
on Saturday. Other instructions can be
obtained by asking anyone in atten
dance at the rally. All the rooters must
be in their seats by 1:30 in order that
many necessary preliminary arrange
ments may be made by the yell leaders.
The yell leaders placed men on the
side of the stadium where, the Blue and
Gold rooting section will be located, and
from the reports that they made every
thing points to a wonderful success in
organized rooting and stunt work. The
rally started at 4:10 and continued till
5:15, giving ample time to go ove/ all
the songs and yells, as well as affording
plenty of time for the Roughs to give
their individual acts for the entertain
ment of the crowd.
Many people not connected with the
University were present to witness the
rally.
