# TWO MEN INJURED IN POLO MATCHES; REDS SWAMP BLUES
## 
### 
A collision between the horses of
L. G. Vanderburg of the White polo
squad, and Norton Worden, â€¢of the
Brown team, resulted in Worden re
ceiving a concussion of the brain, and
ending the match. Worden, who was
riding without a curb rein, had cut
in ahead of Vanderburg, carrying the
ball, and due to an unmanagable
mount was struck by Vanderburg's
horse. Both riders were thrown side
ways, Worden striking a projection
of the ground with his head. He
caught his leg underneath the falling
horse, but escaped without breaking
the bone. He is now at the Peninsula
Hospital, and will be out of the saddle
for some weeks. Vanderburg injured
his mallet hand in the encounter but
is expected to be in shape for the
next contest.
The score, when the matcih was post
poned in the second period, stood 7
to 4 in favor of the Browns, with the
play in the Whites' territory. The
Browns would have had a good chance
to hold their opponents from recover
ing their 7-point handicap, win
ning the match, had it not been for
the accident to their player. The
Whites were held to one score in this
period, against three registered in the
first canto.
The Red team defeatede the Blue,
4 to 3, in the second match of the
day. Major Collins' crimson squad put
over two goals in the first half, over
coming their handicap, and made the
winning score in the second. Here,
however, the Blue riders tied the
tally, and forced the Reds to extend
themselves for another point.
