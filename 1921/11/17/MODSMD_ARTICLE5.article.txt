# GUARD STADIUM, CAMPUS AGAINST ATTACK TONIGHT
## Possible Retaliation Against New Bowl Feared as Result of "C" Painting Wednesday 
### 
Stanford's new stadium and the entire
campus will be guarded tonight by the
sophomore class against possible inva
sion by California students, as an after
math of the painting of the big "C" at
Berkeley last night, Daniel W. Evans,
president of the Associated Students,
announced today. Men of the junior
class will guard tomorrow night.
Official word was received this morn
ing that the big "C" on the Berkeley
campus had been entirely covered with
red paint last night.
As this act is in direct violation of the
agreement between the two Universi
ties, a most serious situation has re
sulted, according to Evans. Official de
nial has already been sent to those in
charge at California, and an investiga
tion started to discover the guilty par
ties. Lloyd Aubert, president of Men's
Council, left early this morning with
copies of the circular that was sent to
all Stanford students, and with a letter
to E. L, Tenney, president of the Cali
fornia student body. These will be read
at the football rally in Berkeley to
night, and an attempt made to avert
an invasion of the Stanford campus,
which would most likely cause an open
break in athletic relations, it* is believed.
The prevailing theory is that some ir
responsibles from the bay region per
petrated the act. Professor Mitchell de
clared that, as every Stanford man had
received a copy of the warning circular,
and was fully aware of the result of an
invasion of the Berkeley campus, he be
lieved it very improbable that a Stan
ford student was responsible.
However, in order to avert any pos
sible attempt by Berkeley supporters on
the Stanford stadium or campus, these
will be guarded until after the game
Saturday. Every man is asked to hold
himself in readiness to answer a general
alarm at any time during the next two
nights. Sirens will be sounded in case
