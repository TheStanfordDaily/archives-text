## 
### 
The bonfire, completed after nine
days of consistent effort by the fresh
men, awaits the torch of the holdovers
that sets it ablaze tonight. California's
coffin, escorted to the lot yesterday by
Sequoia men, now tops the skyscraping
fire.
Last night concluded the evening
guard shifts and Roble's select forty
seven sent the watchers a liberal supply
of sandwiches. A number of "S" men
were on the lot during the evening.
Around one of the fires they held a
solemn convocation. Hungry for any
thing of a California frame of mind, the
letter men were awake for any doubt
fuls.
Standing fifty feet high, the bonfire is
the tallest ever erected on the campus.
Although it has' not as large a base as
last year's, the fire is ten feet higher.
George Menees and Orville Tucker were
the sophomores' chief engineers.
