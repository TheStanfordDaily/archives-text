# DISARMAMENT RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED BY STUDENTS
## 
### Bertha Vaughan, '22 
Realizing that America's university
students of today will bear the brunt
of future wars, and that their interests
and hopes depend largely on the deci
sion reached at the Disarmament Con
ference now in session in Washington,
Stanford today voted unanimously to
adopt and send to that conference the
resolutions favoring disarmament which
were read at the student body assembly.
Professor E. A. Cottrell, of the Po
litical Science Department, emphasized
the importance of sending such resolu
tions to the conference. "It is the pres
sure of such groups that will help the
most in bringing a definite conclusion on
disarmament out of this conference," he
said.
The Washington conference, accord
ing to Cottrell, is facing-two issues:
the limitation of armaments and the Pa
cific problem, neither of which can be
considered separately. Secretary of State
Hughes," he continued, "has astonished
the world with his resolutions for dis
armament. He did not 'speak in phrases,'
according to a summarization by Bal
four, but explained the situation in con
crete terms, which are not to be mis
taken. Hughes represents the opinion
most general in America that we cannot
have total disarmament but limitation
of armaments.
"The policies of the various nations
which were the cause of the recent war,
arc the main obstacles to disarmament,"
said Cottrell. He described China, with
her lack of political organization and
wealth of undeveloped resources, as the
greatest problem of the conference. Dis
organized Russia presents another prob
lem. Closely connected with China is
Japan's national policy. Japan must ex
pand, and that expansion points only to
the east and Their solution," said
Cottrell, "is the subjugation of China,
and their political aggressions on that
nation today arc the rankest that have
ever existed.
"Our own national policy figures with
the demand of England for the freedom

of the seas. France wants one conces
sion—'the assurance that Germany will
not cross her boundaries again—while
the other nations represented want only
minor concessions."
"It is not President Harding. Lloyd
George, or any other member of the
Washington conference, but the students
of today who will stand the brunt of
another war," said Heaton Wrenn, '21,
in speaking of the attitude of the stu
dents of the world toward disarmament.
Wrenn pointed out the intense interest
which European students take in all in
ternational affairs. "They have lived
through war and its atftermath, iand
have real reasons for desiring the pre
vention of its return," he said. "Ameri
can students also took part in the war
and it is for them to do as much as they
can to guide the conference toward a
clear decision on disarmament."
Resolutions drafted by Princeton were
read by Dan Evaps. 1 20, at the close of
the assembly. The Stanford resolutions
which were mailed to the conference
follow:
To the American Delegates to the Wash
ington Disarmament Conference.
Gentle men :
Twenty-seven hundred students of
Stanford University petition that the in
terests and hopes of university students
throughout America be considered in the
decisions you will make as representa
tives of the United States at the Dis
armament Conference. We remind von
that a large proportion of the college
student bodies are composed of former
service men whose experience has
awakened in them the desire to make im
possible the recurrence of war. We real
ize that if you do not put an end to the
competitive building of armaments, the
increasing burden of their maintenance
must lie borne by us in the future, and
that their menace to peace will lie great
er tomorrow than it is today. Further
more, if you should fail to reach an
agreement upon disputes relating to the
Pacific, and America should in conse-
quence be drawn into a war, our homes
upon this Coast would be the first to
be exposed to belligerent activities which
no longer distinguish between combatant
and non-combatant.
We ask, therefore, that the American
government use its best efforts to se
cure an effective limitation of arma
ments, and adjustment of those mis
understandings which threaten to involve
us in war, and the cooperation of all
nations in a permanent agency to sub
stitute reason and law for force and
violence in the settlement of interna
tional disputes. We urge that no fac
tional or partisan interest may be al
lowed to weaken the power of the gov
ernment to pursue effectively these high
ends. And we hope that America will
play boldly at the conference, not
shrinking from the sacrifice of tempor
ary interest for the gain of permanent
achievement, nor indifferent to the needs
of the world. American interests will
find their only permanent protection, and
American traditions their only logical
expression, in the substitution of world
law for world disorder.
