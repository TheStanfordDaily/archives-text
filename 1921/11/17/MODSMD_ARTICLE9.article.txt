# RALLY AND BONFIRE TO STIR CAMPUS TONIGHT
## Admission Is by Student Body Card; Speeches to be Made by Van Gent, Cutler, Field, Patrick, Fitzgerald 
### 
The supporters of the Cardinal will hold the annual Big Game /ally at the
Assembly Hall, at 7:30 tonight. From early indications and from the spirit
shown at the stadium rally yesterday afternoon, tonight's rally pfonrlises to
surpass in many respects any previous rally ever held at Stanford.
The noise will start at 7 o'clock, when Assistant Yell Leader Douglas
starts the parade from the Delta Tau house that will gather together the
entire row population. At the same time the Sequoia Hall crowd will break
forth on its pilgrimage toward the Assembly Hall under the direction of
Assistant Yell Leader Minsky. Encina Hall will let the surrounding country
know at the same time that a howling crowd is starting on some kind of
adventure, when Yell Leader Bob Connolly gives the signal to "fall in."
Admission to the rally will be by student body ticket only, so that It be-

hooves all who desire to have the time
of their lives to see that they have
their student body ticket with them on
arrival at the Assembly Hail. No one
will be admitted without the student
body card.
The seniors and holdovers will guard
the monstrous bonfire from the mythic
al attack of the California .scouting
parties. At 7:80 the varsity football
squad will arrive from the Delta Up
tilon house, the location of the train
ing table, and will march down the
center aisle to a special section in the
front of the hall. Everyone is Urged
to be careful and not yell so loud on
the arrival of the team that the roof
of the hall will be carried away as a
result.
On the stage many of the old
"grads" will be seated as well as the
band. The action at the Assembly
Hall will start at exactly 7:30, and
will continue till around 9 o'clock,
t
when the roaring crowd will form a
column of six abreast and do a snake
dance toward the cracking bonfire
which has been built by the fresh
men directly in rear of the epower
house.
One speaker at the rally w-iH be
Coach Van Gent who will givÂ£ forth
highly desired information about the
"Battle Royal." Assistant Coach Joe
Fitzgerald, the former Harvard Uni
versity star will make his first appear
ance before the entire Stanford stu
dent body and will give additional data
about the Big Game. From all who
have made Fitzgerald's acquaintance
you will learn that he is apt to break
forth with a little humor that will
. J
bring forth a shout from the Stan
fordites. Charles Field, '95, Leland
Cutler, '06, and other "extemporane
ous" speakers will give the assembl
age the attitude of the alumni and
will relate stories of previous Stan
ford victories and adventures in the
long-remembered contests against the
wearers of the Blue and Gold. These
men have followed Stanford for many
years in its numerous activities and
will show the rooters that no matter
what the so-called "dope" says about
the game, the 'fighting Stanford spirit'
can bring a victory again as it has on
previous occasions when the outlook
for victory looked very dismal. Cap
tain Jack Patrick will speak for the
team.
The only restriction on will be
the one, absolutely prohibiting the uw
of firearms within the hall. Any one
doing so will be dealt with by the
Men's Council. This order had to be
made because some rooter last year
became excited and badly mutilated
the ceiling in his enthusiasm. There
will be no restriction on the type and
number of artificial noise-producing
machines that can be used.
