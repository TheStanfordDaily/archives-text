# When Card Meets Bruin
## 
### 
All has been said and all has been done. Two
teams now await the whistle that will start them
into action. One is already named as the winner of
the annual Big Game. Necessarily the other team
is slated to lose. That team is Stanford. The
facts have been laid out, hard and cold as they are.
It has been decreed by man that Stanford is-to lose
tomorrow afternoon to the invaders from across the
bay.
This is as it should l>e. It is not a new situation
for a Stanford football eleven to face. True, the
odds against us are greater than ever before. Stan
ford is meeting a team that is now hoping to com
plete its second season without suffering a defeat.
Stanford lias no such record. The team has fought
and won during these two seasons, but has fought
and lost as well. Tomorrow they will win or lose,
but win or lose they will have fought.
That is all that is expected of the team, and that
is ail that is asked. Stanford is ever as glorious
in defeat as in victory. The pleasure is not so great,
to be sure, but it has never been said of a Stanford
team that it did not give all that it had.
And what of the odds? Are they not man-made?
Can not, then, the power of man overcome them?
Stanford has a football eleven that is composed of
eleven red-blooded fighting men. Only the finest
specimens of physical and mental manhood are suc
cessful football players. In the Bruins from Berke
ley they, will encounter eleven more fine physical
specimens. The capabilities of these men both as a
team and individually has been proved. Stanford
has eleven men who are just as good men physically
and mentally but whose capabilities are not so widely
recognized as that of their opponents.
There, then, is the surprise element. They have
given every promise of being as great on the grid
iron as the invaders, but no one knows just how far
they, can ga when they are pressed. California has
arrived while Stanford is coming. From such a
team as Stanford has almost anything can be ex
pected. Our belief is that Stanford's football varsity
will display some tricks tomorrow that no one now
suspects it to be capable of. Playing to win, as the
Coach and Captain have declared they will be, they
will force the Bruins to their utmost limits of physical
and mental capabilities to prove that they are the
better team.
