# Dedication

### 
Tomocrow evening when the light of the sun has
faded, the. eighteenth game of American football be
tween Stanford and California will have become his
tory. When the shades of evening have followed
in the wake of the sunlight another victory and an
other loss wilt have been recorded in the records of
athletic contests between these two institutions.
But tomorrow will mark one event that will stand
-out as the completion of a singularly wonderful
achievement. That is the dedication of the mag
nificent new Stanford stadium.
Literally springing from the earth upon which it
is now resting, within five and one-half months the
Stanford bowl grew from a project into a reality.
Tomorrow afternoon sixty-five thousand people will
find comfortable seats in the enclosure and for the
first time watch an athletic contest on the green turf
below. Seeing this gigantic stadium for the first
time will incite wonder—wonder at the rapidity with
which it was built and greater admiration at the en
terprise which made it possible.
Construction of the stadium is a typical Stanford
achievement. Realizing the immediate need for such
a structure the Stanford Board of Athletic Control
quietly and inauspiciously started to make plans.
Members of the Stanford Engineering Department
were called into conference and asked to provide
plans for different types of structure. Committees
were organized to raise the funds. With all of
these preparations it seemed doubtful that a stadium
would be built immediately. It was not until a force
of men appeared and began to remove the trees
from the site selected that the realization grew that
the stadium was not a project of the future but one
of the hour.
Today it stands completed and ready for the enor
mous crowd of tomorrow. It is the greatest of a
series of great achievements.
