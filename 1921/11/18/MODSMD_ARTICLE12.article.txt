Dear Head of Cabbage:—This is no time for humor.
It is the time that tries men's souls, that is, the souls
of the rooters and the hides of the players. I will there
fore devote the Colyuni to a serious purpose. Every
body around here knows Stanford opinion of the Big
Game but it might interest you to know how the boys
back in my home-town feel and also how the betting
fraternity dopes the game.
* * *
Mow we will hear from the Bruin Golds.
I have not wasted time asking Coach Smith and
Captain Latham for interviews as Andy always says
he's satisfied and nothing more and George never fails
to remark the team is not overconfident and then quits.
» * *
Field Marshal Erb: —"Frankly, I fear Stanford strate
gy. Cal always tackles so terrific somebody gets hurt
and the more that do the darker it'll be before the
game's over. It'll be blame dark in that hole before
the final gun and I'm figuring Stanford knows better
how to feel its way up its own field after dark. The
Redshirts are liable to steal a couple touchdowns dur
ing the night."
♦ # *
"Brick" Muller: —"1 pass."
* * *
Archie Nesbit —"Can't make a statement until the
game starts. I fear 'Dink' Templeton might be eligible."
Dan McMillan: —"Unless something odd occurs, the
game will be even."
"Crip" Toomey—"l expect to kiss Andy before it's
over, even if he is homelier than a football turf, which
they tell me I'm more liable to kiss."
Lee Cranmer: —"Our line must hold; it's our last
stand; we all graduate in May."
Don Nichols: —"If Stanford wins, the Possum should
become her symbol."
Stan Barnes: —"Our bucks will hang the Indian sign
on the Reds."
Bob Berkey:—"With out ends, we will win by nine
touchbacks."
"Fat" Clark: —"Our only chance to open a stadium
with a win."
* * *
"Brick" Morse—"Cal's game. The varsity is not
equal to '98, but neither is Stanford."
Berkeley Weather Man:—"lt's a cold day when Berke
ley gets left. Sorry cold wind down the Farm is keep
ing the rain away."
* * •
Now for the bookmakers. Berkeley's favorite for
tune teller dopes it as follows. Stanford 0, Washing
ton 0. California Goofs, 72, Washington 3. Therefore,
California varsity 1444, Stanford 0.
* * *
Still, the most reliable Oakland contributor figures:—
Stanford only plays two real games this season. The
first, Stanford 14, O. A. C. r 7. Washington State, with
out Sax, holde Cal to two touchdowns. Washington
State, plus Sax, noses out Aggies 7 to 3. Therefore,
California, 14, Stanford, 7, on dope. Adding Stanford
fight, that according to last year's city paper's is al
ways one touchdown better in big game, just as Cal's
is one touchdown worse; Stanford, 14; California, 7.
Stanford's game.
\* * •
By special arrangement with the California Stadium
Committee, Cabbages has secured a new version of
"The Son of a Gamboleer," which will be sung at the
Big Game, Saturday:
The version follows:
Oh, I wish I had a Stadium, as good as Stanford has,
I'd cease to be ridiculous —the butt of so much razz,
But ours will be of concrete, complete in twenty years.
And how the thing will echo, to our children's chil
dren's cheers.
i
Chorus:
Oh, the class, oh, the class, oh, the class, oh, the class,
oh, the class of '65,
We dedicate our stadium, if they are still alive,
So rally 'round the cash-box, men, each man will give
a dime,
And we'll build the concrete Stadium, and pay for It
on time.
Second Worse.
Of course, it doesn't matter, just when the thing is done,
Posterity can finish what their ancestors begun.
As long as dear old Stanford, can have the game down
there,
We'll keep our structure in reserve, and save the seats
from wear.
Repeat the chorus here, until fatigued.
• * *
Syllabus fees show that the tradition of a poor man's
university is not being neglected.
* • *
Since rushing is over we note that rebuilt steaks are
gaining in strength.
* * *
"The time has come," said Cabbages, "to talk of
many things,
Of Stadiums and football teams, and why the rooter
sings.
Of San Francisco papers, who are handing out the
dope.
And also of eleven men, on whom wo pin our hope,
Of optimistic Stanford gents, who boost them, fair
and true,
With never any holler, or with sign of feeling blue.
Of six or seven coaches, who are giving all they've got,
To put a spoke in Berkeley's wheel, upset the dopester's
pot,
And show the Californi acs the way to shout and sing,
Come on, you gang, get on the boat, rip out a cheor,
old thing,
Forget your studies, trials and woes, and join the
Cabbage Crew,
In shouting, praying, singing, this: "Down with the
Gold and Blue."

You never can tell what the Soph play will be next.

The version follows:
Oh, I wish I had a Stadium, as good as Stanford has,
I'd cease to be ridiculous —the butt of so much razz,
But ours will be of concrete, complete in twenty years.
And how the thing will echo, to our children's chil
dren's cheers.

Chorus:
Oh, the class, oh, the class, oh, the class, oh, the class,
oh, the class of '65,
We dedicate our stadium, if they are still alive,
So rally 'round the cash-box, men, each man will give
a dime,
And we'll build the concrete Stadium, and pay for It
on time.
Second Worse.
Of course, it doesn't matter, just when the thing is done,
Posterity can finish what their ancestors begun.
As long as dear old Stanford, can have the game down

We'll keep our structure in reserve, and save the seats
from wear.

But ours will be of concrete, complete in twenty years.
And how the thing will echo, to our children's chil
dren's cheers.

Chorus:
Oh, the class, oh, the class, oh, the class, oh, the class,
oh, the class of '65,
We dedicate our stadium, if they are still alive,
So rally 'round the cash-box, men, each man will give
a dime,
And we'll build the concrete Stadium, and pay for It
on time.
Second Worse.
Of course, it doesn't matter, just when the thing is done,
Posterity can finish what their ancestors begun.
As long as dear old Stanford, can have the game down
there,
We'll keep our structure in reserve, and save the seats
from wear.
Repeat the chorus here, until fatigued.

"The time has come," said Cabbages, "to talk of

Of Stadiums and football teams, and why the rooter

Of San Francisco papers, who are handing out the

And also of eleven men, on whom wo pin our hope,
Of optimistic Stanford gents, who boost them, fair

With never any holler, or with sign of feeling blue.
Of six or seven coaches, who are giving all they've got,
To put a spoke in Berkeley's wheel, upset the dopester's

And show the Californi acs the way to shout and sing,

Dear Head of Cabbage:—This is no time for humor.
It is the time that tries men's souls, that is, the souls
of the rooters and the hides of the players. I will there
fore devote the Colyuni to a serious purpose. Every
body around here knows Stanford opinion of the Big
Game but it might interest you to know how the boys
back in my home-town feel and also how the betting
fraternity dopes the game.
* * *
Mow we will hear from the Bruin Golds.
I have not wasted time asking Coach Smith and
Captain Latham for interviews as Andy always says
he's satisfied and nothing more and George never fails
to remark the team is not overconfident and then quits.

Field Marshal Erb: —"Frankly, I fear Stanford strate
gy. Cal always tackles so terrific somebody gets hurt
and the more that do the darker it'll be before the
game's over. It'll be blame dark in that hole before
the final gun and I'm figuring Stanford knows better
how to feel its way up its own field after dark. The
Redshirts are liable to steal a couple touchdowns dur
ing the night."

"Brick" Muller: —"1 pass."

Archie Nesbit —"Can't make a statement until the
game starts. I fear 'Dink' Templeton might be eligible."
Dan McMillan: —"Unless something odd occurs, the
game will be even."
"Crip" Toomey—"l expect to kiss Andy before it's
over, even if he is homelier than a football turf, which
they tell me I'm more liable to kiss."
Lee Cranmer: —"Our line must hold; it's our last
stand; we all graduate in May."
Don Nichols: —"If Stanford wins, the Possum should
become her symbol."
Stan Barnes: —"Our bucks will hang the Indian sign
on the Reds."
Bob Berkey:—"With out ends, we will win by nine
touchbacks."
"Fat" Clark: —"Our only chance to open a stadium

Now for the bookmakers. Berkeley's favorite for
tune teller dopes it as follows. Stanford 0, Washing
ton 0. California Goofs, 72, Washington 3. Therefore,
California varsity 1444, Stanford 0.

Still, the most reliable Oakland contributor figures:—
Stanford only plays two real games this season. The
first, Stanford 14, O. A. C. r 7. Washington State, with
out Sax, holde Cal to two touchdowns. Washington
State, plus Sax, noses out Aggies 7 to 3. Therefore,
California, 14, Stanford, 7, on dope. Adding Stanford
fight, that according to last year's city paper's is al
ways one touchdown better in big game, just as Cal's
is one touchdown worse; Stanford, 14; California, 7.

By special arrangement with the California Stadium
Committee, Cabbages has secured a new version of
"The Son of a Gamboleer," which will be sung at the
Big Game, Saturday:
The version follows:

I'd cease to be ridiculous —the butt of so much razz,
But ours will be of concrete, complete in twenty years.
And how the thing will echo, to our children's chil
