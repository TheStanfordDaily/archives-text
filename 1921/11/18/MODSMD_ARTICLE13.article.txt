# TRANS-BAY SQUAD LIKE DEMPSEY SAYS CALL SPORT EDITOR

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 18.—Much
as I'd like to write that I look for a
Cardinal victory at the history-making
opening of the new stadium with to
morrow's Big Game, I can't go behind
the facts.
California has a great team, fully as
formidable as last year, probably more
so. California has a team that has
never in two years of play been put to
the test. The Pacific Fleet eleven, which
later on gave Stanford its only defeat
of the year, came close to routing the
Bears, but the injection of "Crip"
Toomey into the pastime at a crucial
moment, one sensational play by Don
Nichols, and the Bears were themselves
once more, to win about as they pleased.
Stanford, to my mind, has been a dis
appointment this year; more, perhaps,
than ever before, because from time to
time it showed possibilities of greatness
that made subsequent "flops" all the
more painful.
There is iv> use in recounting the
panics played by the two teams against
the same opponents. To do so would
make a tale that would not be read
with satisfaction by Stanfordites, and as
this is for a Stanford student publica
tion, what's the use of rubbing it in?
Off and on I have thought that Stan
ford. would come along and be a real
factor in the Big Game. I don't think
so any longer. The Cardinals have been
too much of an in and outer to make an
impression against the truly great Cali
fornia team.
California has it in its power to run
up a large score on Stanford in the Big
Game tomorrow. Football followers will
be surprised if California does not do so.
Perhaps my opinion doesn't count for
much. I have not seen the Stanford
team play this year, and depend for my
observations on comparative scores, and
on what members of my staff have told
me. But with respect to Stanford and
California this year, I feel as I did
when Jack Dempsey went into training
for his match with Georges Carpentier.
I did not see Carpentier in training
for that match. It wasn't necessary. I
had seen Dempsey, and knew him.
I have seen California play this year.

EDITOR'S NOTE—The following com
munication 7uas received by the Daily
Palo Alto through the mail. It is
considered zoorthy of publication.

We of former years envy you! Yours
is a wonderful opportunity!
The press of California, the public at
large, more especially, however, the
enemy at Berkeley—all have you "doped"
to lose next Saturday by a score of
about 60 to 0! And the best of it is,
comparative scopes support them in the
belief that the California team is about
60 points stronger than you!
Do you see your opportunity?
The Stanford Spirit in the past has
overcome heavy odds. Never has it
conquered such odds as it will face on
Saturday afternoon.
This is no reflection against the Stan
ford team. California simply has a re
markably strong machine.
Certain writers have recently ques
tioned the Stanford Spirit. These per
sons maintain that the spirit at Stanford
is not superior to that at California.
We know that it is!
We ask you —men of the Stanford
football team of 1921—was there ever
such a golden chance as this to dem
oty|ratc for all time, what the Stanford
SfMrit can accomplish?
We old-timers envy you, indeed!
Guarders of the Stanford goal line,
rise to the occasion. Thus far this sea
son, you have merely produced good
football. On Saturday afternoon your
Alma Mater counts on you to produce
that super-human something we call in
spiration. Inspired with the achieve
ments of Stanford's glorious past, we
look for you—we shall count on you —
we knoiv that you will arise to the un
precedented opportunity!
