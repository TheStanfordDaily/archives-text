# BRUIN WRITER SEES VICTORY IN STORE FOR BERKELEY MEN
## 
### R. A. Cushman, '24 
Daily Californian.
Victories for two years, without a
single defeat, will stand behind the Bruin
eleven tomorrow when it crouches tense
during that moment before the kick-off,
waiting for the referee's whistle that
start the 1921 Big Game.
For two seasons Bruin football teams
have never tasted defeat. For two years
California has emerged victorious from
every game, usually by a large score.
The best teams of the coast have been
met and defeated and last year Ohio
State, winner of the Big Ten conference
and pride of the middle west, went down
before the onslaught of the Bear.
There has been a change in the
coaches' policy this season. In only one
or two instances has any attempt been
made to run up as large a score as did
the 1920 varsity. This, together with the
fact that every team that played Cali
fornia has been trained and coached
with one idea to beat California this
year, has been the cause of the lower
scores this season.
However, a glimpse at the California
scores show that that 270 points have
been piled up by the varsity, while only
26 have been scored against it so far
this season. Also, an analysis of the
scores-and the comparative strength of
the opposing teams show that the Cali
fornia team has gained strength stead
ily during the season, and has shown
the greatest strength in the last two
games.
A brief resume of the games played
this season shows how California has
run up 270 points while her opponents
have been held to 26.
California 21, St. Mary's 0.
The St. Mary's game was the first of
the season, and the Saints fought the
Bruins from whistle to whistle, holding
them to three touchdowns and largely
retrieving their 127-0 defeat of the year
before. "Crip" Toomey stood out as
the star of the game with two touch
downs to his credit, one from a 70-yard
run.
California 14, Olympic Club 0.
The game with the Olympic Club is
generally considered the greatest defen
sive game ever played on California
field Twice during the last quarter
California carricd the ball to the 1-yard
line only to be held for downs by the
unbreakable club line. "Bob" Berkey
dashed all over the field and distin
guished himself that day.
California 51, Nevada 6.
Chief interest in this game centered
on the playing of "Rabbit" Bradshaw,
the diminutive Sagebrush quarterback
who, with Halfback Reed, made nearly
all the gains. This combination was
also responsible for the first score of
the season against California when, in
the last quarter, Reed caught a pass
from Bradshaw arid ran sixty yards to
a touchdown. It was also in this game
that "Brick" Midler's knee was injured.
California 21, Pacific Fleet 10.
For the first time in two years a Cali
fornia football team was behind when
the Sailors kicked a field goal in the
first few minutes of play. "Wild Bill"
Ingram, All-American fullback, and the
All-American and Annapolis linesman,
proved almost too much for the Blue
and Gold by tearing great holes in the

line, but the onslaught was finally
stopped and California was able to pull
out and win the game by a comfortable
margin.
California 39, Univ. of Oregon 0.
This was the first conference game of
the season. As if to give Oregon all
possible advantage it rained that day, but
even this was not sufficient to keep the
"webfooters" from going down to a
39 0 defeat.
California 14, Washington State 0.
This was undoubtedly the hardest
game of the season. It was played
away from home and the team was badly
crippled by injuries. Washington was
unable to buck the Bruin line and made
yardage only on forward passes and a
few end runs. California has "Crip"
Toomey to thank for both touchdowns
and over half the yardage gained from
scrimmage during the game.
California 38, U. S. C. 7.
With rivalry running high, California
won this most bitterly contested game
by a large margin. Only during the
first quarter was U. S. C. dangerous.
Once the score stood 7-7 after U. S. C.
advanced the ball to the 5-yard line and
Dean smashed through for a touchdown.
In the second half Don Nichols fur
nished most of the thrills with long
dashes after catching passes, or from
end runs.
California 72, Univ. of Wash. 3
The last conference game will stand
as a tribute to the second-team players.
Most of them went into the game after
the first varsity had run up a score
of 30-3. It took them one quarter to
get used to playing together, but then
they went! Five touchdowns were
scored in the final quarter. "Duke"
Morrison scored four of them and also
one in the third quarter, distinguishing
himself as the star of the day.

the season, and the Saints fought the
Bruins from whistle to whistle, holding
them to three touchdowns and largely
retrieving their 127-0 defeat of the year
before. "Crip" Toomey stood out as
the star of the game with two touch
downs to his credit, one from a 70-yard
run.
California 14, Olympic Club 0.
The game with the Olympic Club is
generally considered the greatest defen
sive game ever played on California
field Twice during the last quarter
California carricd the ball to the 1-yard
line only to be held for downs by the
unbreakable club line. "Bob" Berkey
dashed all over the field and distin
guished himself that day.
California 51, Nevada 6.
Chief interest in this game centered
on the playing of "Rabbit" Bradshaw,
the diminutive Sagebrush quarterback
who, with Halfback Reed, made nearly
all the gains. This combination was
also responsible for the first score of
the season against California when, in
the last quarter, Reed caught a pass
from Bradshaw arid ran sixty yards to
a touchdown. It was also in this game
that "Brick" Midler's knee was injured.
California 21, Pacific Fleet 10.
For the first time in two years a Cali
fornia football team was behind when
the Sailors kicked a field goal in the
first few minutes of play. "Wild Bill"
Ingram, All-American fullback, and the
All-American and Annapolis linesman,
proved almost too much for the Blue
and Gold by tearing great holes in the

line, but the onslaught was finally
stopped and California was able to pull
out and win the game by a comfortable
margin.
California 39, Univ. of Oregon 0.
This was the first conference game of
the season. As if to give Oregon all
possible advantage it rained that day, but
even this was not sufficient to keep the
"webfooters" from going down to a
39 0 defeat.
California 14, Washington State 0.
This was undoubtedly the hardest
game of the season. It was played
away from home and the team was badly
crippled by injuries. Washington was
unable to buck the Bruin line and made
yardage only on forward passes and a
few end runs. California has "Crip"
Toomey to thank for both touchdowns
and over half the yardage gained from
scrimmage during the game.
California 38, U. S. C. 7.
With rivalry running high, California
won this most bitterly contested game
by a large margin. Only during the
first quarter was U. S. C. dangerous.
Once the score stood 7-7 after U. S. C.
advanced the ball to the 5-yard line and
Dean smashed through for a touchdown.
In the second half Don Nichols fur
nished most of the thrills with long
dashes after catching passes, or from
end runs.
California 72, Univ. of Wash. 3
The last conference game will stand
as a tribute to the second-team players.
Most of them went into the game after
the first varsity had run up a score
of 30-3. It took them one quarter to
get used to playing together, but then
they went! Five touchdowns were
scored in the final quarter. "Duke"
Morrison scored four of them and also
one in the third quarter, distinguishing
himself as the star of the day.

Victories for two years, without a
single defeat, will stand behind the Bruin
eleven tomorrow when it crouches tense
during that moment before the kick-off,
waiting for the referee's whistle that
start the 1921 Big Game.
For two seasons Bruin football teams
have never tasted defeat. For two years
California has emerged victorious from
every game, usually by a large score.
The best teams of the coast have been
met and defeated and last year Ohio
State, winner of the Big Ten conference
and pride of the middle west, went down
before the onslaught of the Bear.
There has been a change in the
coaches' policy this season. In only one
or two instances has any attempt been
made to run up as large a score as did
the 1920 varsity. This, together with the
fact that every team that played Cali
fornia has been trained and coached
with one idea to beat California this
year, has been the cause of the lower
scores this season.
However, a glimpse at the California
scores show that that 270 points have
been piled up by the varsity, while only
26 have been scored against it so far
this season. Also, an analysis of the
scores-and the comparative strength of
the opposing teams show that the Cali
fornia team has gained strength stead
ily during the season, and has shown
the greatest strength in the last two
games.
A brief resume of the games played
this season shows how California has
run up 270 points while her opponents
have been held to 26.

California 39, Univ. of Oregon 0.
This was the first conference game of
the season. As if to give Oregon all
possible advantage it rained that day, but
even this was not sufficient to keep the
"webfooters" from going down to a
39 0 defeat.
California 14, Washington State 0.
This was undoubtedly the hardest
game of the season. It was played
away from home and the team was badly
crippled by injuries. Washington was
unable to buck the Bruin line and made
yardage only on forward passes and a
few end runs. California has "Crip"
Toomey to thank for both touchdowns
and over half the yardage gained from
scrimmage during the game.
California 38, U. S. C. 7.
With rivalry running high, California
won this most bitterly contested game
by a large margin. Only during the
first quarter was U. S. C. dangerous.
Once the score stood 7-7 after U. S. C.
advanced the ball to the 5-yard line and
Dean smashed through for a touchdown.
In the second half Don Nichols fur
nished most of the thrills with long
dashes after catching passes, or from
end runs.
California 72, Univ. of Wash. 3
The last conference game will stand
as a tribute to the second-team players.
Most of them went into the game after
the first varsity had run up a score
of 30-3. It took them one quarter to
get used to playing together, but then
they went! Five touchdowns were
scored in the final quarter. "Duke"
Morrison scored four of them and also
one in the third quarter, distinguishing
himself as the star of the day.
