# CHEERI-0 REVUE TO BE BIG GAME DAY AFTERMATH
## 
### Worth W. Caldwell, '24 
Tomorrow night at 8 o'clock the cur
tain will rise in the Stanford Assembly
Hall on the Hammer and Coffin football
show. This performance will stand as
a fitting and grand climax to a day full
of festivity and excitement.
Music, fun, and beauty are the three
essential elements in this musical re
vue. All these characteristics Ijave been
so carefully blended together that the
audience should carry away with it a
lasting impression of harmony and beau
tiful effects.
To Myron Higby, '22, goes the credit
for some of the finest music ever com
posed and presented on this campus. Of
course, he has been assisted by numer
ous other musical lights in the prepara
tion of the many song and dance nurtv
hers in the football show, but the final
results will be due to his direction and
management. Such melodies as "Sweet
Sixteen" and the "Palm Beach Honey
moon" are sure to sweep the campus by
storm.
Fun remains absolutely the keynote
of the "Cheeri-O" revue. There will
not be a single heavy or melodramatic
sketch used in the entire performance.
The purpose of the whole evening is to
create a spirit of gaety and frivolity—
and this is guaranteed by the large'corps
of fun-makers participating in the show.
The scenic effects arc to be very sim
ple throughout. Tn most cases, drop
curtains are used in lieu of the tradi
tional sets. But invariably just the right
effect is secured. Ernest Greppin, '24,
has cooperated with the scenic artists
and planned a novel lighting system that
will emphasize the appearance of the
stage draperies at all times.
