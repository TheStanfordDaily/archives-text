# CHRONICLE SPORTS PROPHET DEPICTS OUTCOME OF BATTLE

Can a man with a slingshot beat, a
man with an automatic?
Tint's my answer to the query : "Wlu:
will win the Pig Game tomo row:"
Lest tiltro be an misunde -standing, I
iigiue that Stanford has th; slingshot
and California lias the automatic.
It is true that David once won an im
portant battle with a slingshot. But
Goliath, the heaveyweight champion who
opposed him, was armed with a long
sword and David plunked him fairly
between the eyes before he could get
within striking distance.
An automatic reaches farther than a
sword.
It would be a wonderful thing if Stan
ford could dedicate its new stadium with
a victory over California tomorrow, but
I figure it just can't be done.
The Stanford Spirit is a splendid
thing. But California also has spiritâ€”
plus football knowledge and experience
and teamwork of deadly efficiency.
It is tough luck that Stanford, coming
back to American football after a long
absence, should have to buck California
just when that university is turning out
some of the very best teams in the
United States. In a little while Stan
ford will be on even terms with Cali
fornia, but right now, California has all
the edge.
