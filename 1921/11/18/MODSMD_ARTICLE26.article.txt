Everyone thought that John Donald
("Scotchy") Campbell was a backfield
man until Line Coach J. B. Canning
conceived the idea of trying him in the
line. "Scotch" only needed a trial. It
is needless to say that he made good
with a vengeance. He is slated to break
into the Big Game tomorrow at one of

the guards before the final gun sounds.
Campbell hails from San Francisco,
where he played rugby for Lowell High
School. He is a member of Alpha Delta
Phi, is 20 years old, weighs 177 pounds,
and is 5 feet 8 inches tall. His squad
number is 20. He is a member of the
class of 1924, and played half on the
freshman team last season.
