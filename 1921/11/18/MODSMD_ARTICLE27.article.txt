# NORMAN CLEVELAND
## 
### 
Norman Cleveland lives in Berkeley,
but despite this apparent hand'cap he is
a good football player. When Norman
reached that moment in his career when
it was time for him to go to college,
Papa Cleveland said to California lie
should go. But Norman stamped his
foot in youthful rage, and came to Stan
ford. He came here fighting and he has
been fighting ever since. That's why he
is such a valuable man to the Stanford
squad.
Cleveland went into the Nevada game
last Saturday in the last few minutes of
play at halfback. He is 20 years old,
and is a junior. He is 5 feet 10 inches
in height, and weighs 154 pounds. He is
majoring in Mechanical Engineering.
Cleveland is a member of Sigma Chi
fraternity.
