# JOE DOUGLASS
## 
### 
One of the best guards on the Stan
ford varsity is that man Joe Garner
Douglass (No. 16). He played through
the Nevada contest Saturday and looked
like a million dollars. When he was a
freshman, Douglass played half on the

'23 team and was always good for gains.
Line Coach Canning has made the big
fellow into a lineman, and a good one,
too. Douglass is from Blythe, Cal., and
majors in the Economics Department. He
stands just six feet in height and tips the
beams at 197 pounds. He is 21 years
old. He is a member of Sigma Nu.


JOE DOUGLASS
Husky Stanford lineman, who will be
ready for the fray tomorrow with
his 200 pounds to stop the Cali
fornia onslaught.
