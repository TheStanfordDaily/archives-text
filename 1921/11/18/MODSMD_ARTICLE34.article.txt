If nobody insults Frederic Sebastian
Ludeke (No. 13) tomorrow, it is very
likely that he will continue to play as he
has all season, content to break up play
after play over his side of the line at
tackle, recover a few fumbles and toss
several Bears behind the line. But if
anything should happen to spoil his ada
mant disposition and the big boy should
get mad —look out! Out for the center

berth originally, Ludeke spent his leisure
time this summer snapping a ball at a
white spot on the farm barn near Shan
don, California. Working with the same
spirit on last year's freshman team and
in all of the preliminary games this sea
son, he has cinched a block "S," for he
is certain to get into tomorrow's affair.
Ludeke weighs 207 pounds, and tops
every man 011 the squad with his 6 feet
3 inches.


FRED LUDEKE
Stanford's giant tackle. Ludeke is one
of the hardest workers on the squad
and much depends on his work to
morrow.
