# "DUD" DE GROOT
## 
### 
The middle portion of a football
team's line must be strong, and that job
on the Stanford varsity is ably filled by
the imposing figure of Dudley Sargent
(Dud) De Groot, '23. He is No. 4on
the squad, and played in the Big Game
last year at guard. He is one of the
five men on the varsity weighing 200

pounds or more. De Groot tips the
scales at an even 200. The big center
is and has been all seaon a tower of
strength in the Stanford defense, and he
will start the game tomorrow afternoon.
De Groot is 6 feet 2 inches in height, is
21 years old .majors in zoology, and
calls Sierra Madre his home town. He
is a Sigma Nu.
