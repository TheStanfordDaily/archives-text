# ART WILCOX
## 
### 
Last year Chester Arthur (Art) Wil
cox was Captain of the Stanford varsity
and was one of the stars of the team.
This year he lias been a meteor at left
half. He can buck the line, run the ends
and is regarded as Stanford's best de
fensive player. It is said that Art fur
nished the punch to the Cardinal offen
sive. He is a cinch to start the big fray
tomorrow, and the California "wonder"

team will have to watch him. He will
probably do the kicking for the varsity.
I Wilcox is 5 feet 10 inches tall and
weighs 161 pounds. He is 25 years old
and registers in the meclianical engi
neering department from Pasadena, al
though he played four years of high
school football at Long Beach. He is a
member of Chi Psi. Wilcox is No. 2 on
the varsity.
