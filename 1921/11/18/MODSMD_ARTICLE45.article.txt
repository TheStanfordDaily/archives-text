# BENNY BENNINGER
## 
### 
Charles J. Benninger, jr., won his '24
numerals in football last year, playing
in the backfield. He came out this year
and worked his way from the second
stringers on the varsity squad. He is
a halfback and bears the number 30 on
the back of his sweater. He is a fighter
and should Gene Van Gent see fit to
send him into the fray against the
Bruins tomorrow he will give all that he
has, that's a certainty. Benninger
weighs 159 pounds and is 22 years old.
He registers from San Francisco. He is
a member of Delta Tau Delta.
