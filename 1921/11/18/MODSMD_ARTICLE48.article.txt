# RESUME OF SEASON SHOWS VARSITY IS UPSETTER OF DOPE
## 
### Tom Irwin, '23 
September 15 found over fifty old
men and new on the Stanford turf i
ready for the first workouts of the 1921 j
season. With the first to appear were j
the new coaches, Gene Van Gent and
Joe Fitzgerald, together with "Dink" j
Templeton and J. B. Canning. Pros- j
pects for a successful season were
brighter than they have been for many ■
'a long day. Comment by sport critics
indicated more interest than ever in
football rivalry and Big Game enthu
siasm waxed warm from the first of the
grid season.
Registration day marked the opener
for the varsity against the Mare Island
Marines. Pigskin fans expected to see
the earth dusted off with the invaders'
moleskins and if a lopsided score of 41
to 0 means defeat, few were disap
pointed. Little but a strong defensive
was shown by the Cards in the first
two periods, but soon after the opening
of the third quarter, Van Gent's squad
galloped through the opposing line al
most at will, circled the ends and com
pleted passes sufficient in number to
ring up five touchdowns. Doughty was
the outstanding star of the season's
opener. Patrick and Wilcox were good
for yards every time they got the ball,
and Shlaudeman's accurate passes ac
counted for more than one gain that
meant a touchdown. There were those
who thought the score would have been
larger, but the showing was more than
satisfactory after two weeks of light
work.
St. Mary's failed to follow the ball in
its battle with the Cards the week fol
lowing, and although conceded a vic
tory by virtue of her ability to hold the
Bruin eleven to a 21-0 score the week
before, lost to the Red-shirts 7-10.
Stockton, Silva and Black in the Saints'
backfield rushed the Cards off their feet
at several times during the game, but
costly fumbles prevented them from
changing the story of defeat to one of
victory. A well-placed drop-kick by
Captain Jack Patrick, after a drive to
the Saints' ten-yard line, gave Stanford
the necessary points for a win. Pat
rick and Doughty in the backfield and
Carter and De Groot in the line starred
in this game.
A 7-0 score fails to tell the story of
a decisive victory over the Olympic Club
by the Cards on Ewing Field in San
Francisco on October 15. It was the
fust Stanford victory over the wearers
of the Winged "O" since the resump
tion of the American game on the Farm.
The Redshirts outplayed the clubmen at
all stages and in all phases of the con
test, with the result that an official of
the Club said after the game that Van

Gent had placed the Stanford varsity on
the 1921 football map.
The Card offense was vastly superior
to that of the Olympics. Huge holes
made by varsity linesmen were runways
for the fleet backfield of which Patrick
and Shlaudeman were outstanding stars.
Faville, until then unheard of as
varsity material, played a remarkable
game at center. Fred Ludeke, guard on
last year's freshmen team, playing at
tackle, broke up play after play launched
by the opposition. The game was Stan
ford's from start to finish.
Fleet Downs Stanford
Stanford lost for the first and last
time of the season to the Pacific Fleet
the following week on a sloppy turf by
a scpre of 27 to 7. It was a case of too
much "Big Bill" Ingram, too much rain,
and too little ability to solve plays re
volving about the opposition's great
fullback. The mariners seemed quite
at home on the wet field, but it was an
entirely new sensation to the Cards and
a woeful lack of line-plunging ability
resulted. The Fleet had previously been
beaten by California by a score of 21-10
and was doped to defeat Stanford fully
as badly as it did. The dope bucket
regained its equilibrium for the first
time during the season only to be spilled
again the following week.
Doped to win by three touchdowns,
the Oregon Aggies lost to the Cards on
October 28, 14-7. The victory tied Stan
ford with California for the Coast Con
ference lead and marked the 1921 var
sity as an organization able to come up
from behind. As one sport critic put it,
"the Aggie game was a case of a faster,
cleverer organization pitted against a
heavier, overconfident team that was not
satisfied with a y<:>" The momentum
play, new to Stanford, was introduced
by Van Gent in this game and worked
time after time for big gains. The Ag
gies never punted until the fourth down,
regardless of position on the field,
striving until the end to overcome a tie
which ended up with a loss. Had the
Aggies kicked instead of passing on one
occasion with their backs to the goal
posts, Patrick would have never inter
cepted a pass that meant the winning
touchdown.
The work of Wilcox in line-plunging,
Patrick's uncanny ability to pick out
enemy passes, and Shlaudeman's twist
ing run in returning punts were largely
responsible for a Cardinal victory.
There was no fluke about the game.
The breaks were even and the Aggies
failed to equal the Card standard in
any department.
Sun Dodgers Pull Surprise
A 0-0 draw resulted from the con
test with the University of Washington
the following week, despite predictions
that the Cards should win by three or
four touchdowns. The Aggies defeated
Washington 24-0 and the Cards had put
the Aggies to sleep, 14-7. Stanford, of
course, had a long trip, had little prac
tice following the Aggie game, Wilcox,
Carter and Ludeke were in poor shape,
and the field was strange, To make
matters worse, it rained and the Cards
were lost. However, the varsity made
• more yards from scrimmage and com
pleted more passes, besides endanger
ing the Sun Dodgers' goal three times
in the last quarter. The substitution of
Wilcox in the last period put more fire
in the team than a tankful of synthetic
gin. Washington fans threw up their
hands in despair as the Cards approached
the opposition's goal, and some of them
have never doped out yet why Stanford
didn't win when Betts caught a pass
over the line.
Even Coach Enoch VBagshaw as much
as admitted that the Cards could beat
the Sun Dodgers badly on their own
field or on any dry one. A wet ball to
a Stanford fan is like soap to a Bol
shevik. Stanford is plainly a dry land
place supporting a strictly a dry land
team. Aquatics never enters into the
game.
The dope bucket leaped into the air
and turned a complete somersault, spil
ling dope from Reno to Palo Alto when
Nevada held the Redshirts to a 14-14
tie last Saturday. The suprise at the
Washington game was scarcely explained
before the Nevada mystery presented
itself for explanation. Whatever may
have been the cause, it was certain that
the Cards were away off-form—appar
ently stale. They were not playing to
gether, and they did not seem to be
fighting as they fought against the Ag
gies and against St. Mary's. And be
sides, Van Gent was trying out a flock
of ends who, judging by all appearances,
offered scant improvement over the reg
ulars. Art Wilcox was not in the game
and those who saw him go at Seattle
when he was put in the last quarter will
vouch for the fact that his presence
would have made a big difference.
Ludeke was unable to play the whole
game, Betts did not get in, and in fact,
the team as a machine was simply not
there. Perhaps it's a good thing for
the varsity that the bad day came last
Saturday. Stanford usually has a bad
day in the preliminary season every
year, and there's no doubt that Saturday
was the prize of the lot. One good
thing about the game was the fact that
no serious injuries resulted. A squad that
is at least in fair physical condition will
meet California tomorrow and that is
more than Stanford has often been able
to say in the past.
Hakd Work Not Told
Four wins, two draws and a defeat
tell the story of the 1921 season for the
Cardinal eleven. Reviews of the games
and interviews with critics and authori
ties will never tell half the story of
the hard work, heavy season, handicaps
and eventual preliminary football su
premacy peculiar to the Stanford squad.
Words cannot tell a third of the story
of the difficulties encountered by the
coaching staff in building a varsity squad
from the material remaining from last
year. Stanford, in her third year of
American football, has reached a place
where she can claim football success.
California is universally acclaimed a
success and is an overwhelming favorite
for a win. Tomorrow puts brain and
brawn, man against man to the test. If
either team fails to give all it has, that
team will lose whether it wears the Red
or the Gold and Blue.

which ended up with a loss. Had the
Aggies kicked instead of passing on one
occasion with their backs to the goal
posts, Patrick would have never inter
cepted a pass that meant the winning
touchdown.
The work of Wilcox in line-plunging,
Patrick's uncanny ability to pick out
enemy passes, and Shlaudeman's twist
ing run in returning punts were largely
responsible for a Cardinal victory.
There was no fluke about the game.
The breaks were even and the Aggies
failed to equal the Card standard in
any department.
Sun Dodgers Pull Surprise
A 0-0 draw resulted from the con
test with the University of Washington
the following week, despite predictions
that the Cards should win by three or
four touchdowns. The Aggies defeated
Washington 24-0 and the Cards had put
the Aggies to sleep, 14-7. Stanford, of
course, had a long trip, had little prac
tice following the Aggie game, Wilcox,
Carter and Ludeke were in poor shape,
and the field was strange, To make
matters worse, it rained and the Cards
were lost. However, the varsity made
• more yards from scrimmage and com
pleted more passes, besides endanger
ing the Sun Dodgers' goal three times
in the last quarter. The substitution of
Wilcox in the last period put more fire
in the team than a tankful of synthetic
gin. Washington fans threw up their
hands in despair as the Cards approached
the opposition's goal, and some of them
have never doped out yet why Stanford
didn't win when Betts caught a pass
over the line.
Even Coach Enoch VBagshaw as much
as admitted that the Cards could beat
the Sun Dodgers badly on their own
field or on any dry one. A wet ball to
a Stanford fan is like soap to a Bol
shevik. Stanford is plainly a dry land
place supporting a strictly a dry land
team. Aquatics never enters into the
game.
The dope bucket leaped into the air
and turned a complete somersault, spil
ling dope from Reno to Palo Alto when
Nevada held the Redshirts to a 14-14
tie last Saturday. The suprise at the
Washington game was scarcely explained
before the Nevada mystery presented
itself for explanation. Whatever may
have been the cause, it was certain that
the Cards were away off-form—appar
ently stale. They were not playing to
gether, and they did not seem to be
fighting as they fought against the Ag
gies and against St. Mary's. And be
sides, Van Gent was trying out a flock
of ends who, judging by all appearances,
offered scant improvement over the reg
ulars. Art Wilcox was not in the game
and those who saw him go at Seattle
when he was put in the last quarter will
vouch for the fact that his presence
would have made a big difference.
Ludeke was unable to play the whole
game, Betts did not get in, and in fact,
the team as a machine was simply not
there. Perhaps it's a good thing for
the varsity that the bad day came last
Saturday. Stanford usually has a bad
day in the preliminary season every
year, and there's no doubt that Saturday
was the prize of the lot. One good
thing about the game was the fact that
no serious injuries resulted. A squad that
is at least in fair physical condition will
meet California tomorrow and that is
more than Stanford has often been able
to say in the past.
Hakd Work Not Told
Four wins, two draws and a defeat
tell the story of the 1921 season for the
Cardinal eleven. Reviews of the games
and interviews with critics and authori
ties will never tell half the story of
the hard work, heavy season, handicaps
and eventual preliminary football su
premacy peculiar to the Stanford squad.
Words cannot tell a third of the story
of the difficulties encountered by the
coaching staff in building a varsity squad
from the material remaining from last
year. Stanford, in her third year of
American football, has reached a place
where she can claim football success.
California is universally acclaimed a
success and is an overwhelming favorite
for a win. Tomorrow puts brain and
brawn, man against man to the test. If
either team fails to give all it has, that
team will lose whether it wears the Red
or the Gold and Blue.
September 15 found over fifty old
men and new on the Stanford turf i
ready for the first workouts of the 1921 j
season. With the first to appear were j
the new coaches, Gene Van Gent and
Joe Fitzgerald, together with "Dink" j
Templeton and J. B. Canning. Pros- j
pects for a successful season were
brighter than they have been for many ■
'a long day. Comment by sport critics
indicated more interest than ever in
football rivalry and Big Game enthu
siasm waxed warm from the first of the
grid season.
Registration day marked the opener
for the varsity against the Mare Island
Marines. Pigskin fans expected to see
the earth dusted off with the invaders'
moleskins and if a lopsided score of 41
to 0 means defeat, few were disap
pointed. Little but a strong defensive
was shown by the Cards in the first
two periods, but soon after the opening
of the third quarter, Van Gent's squad
galloped through the opposing line al
most at will, circled the ends and com
pleted passes sufficient in number to
ring up five touchdowns. Doughty was
the outstanding star of the season's
opener. Patrick and Wilcox were good
for yards every time they got the ball,
and Shlaudeman's accurate passes ac
counted for more than one gain that
meant a touchdown. There were those
who thought the score would have been
larger, but the showing was more than
satisfactory after two weeks of light
work.
St. Mary's failed to follow the ball in
its battle with the Cards the week fol
lowing, and although conceded a vic
tory by virtue of her ability to hold the
Bruin eleven to a 21-0 score the week
before, lost to the Red-shirts 7-10.
Stockton, Silva and Black in the Saints'
backfield rushed the Cards off their feet
at several times during the game, but
costly fumbles prevented them from
changing the story of defeat to one of
victory. A well-placed drop-kick by
Captain Jack Patrick, after a drive to
the Saints' ten-yard line, gave Stanford
the necessary points for a win. Pat
rick and Doughty in the backfield and
Carter and De Groot in the line starred
in this game.
A 7-0 score fails to tell the story of
a decisive victory over the Olympic Club
by the Cards on Ewing Field in San
Francisco on October 15. It was the
fust Stanford victory over the wearers
of the Winged "O" since the resump
tion of the American game on the Farm.
The Redshirts outplayed the clubmen at
all stages and in all phases of the con
test, with the result that an official of
the Club said after the game that Van

Gent had placed the Stanford varsity on
the 1921 football map.
The Card offense was vastly superior
to that of the Olympics. Huge holes
made by varsity linesmen were runways
for the fleet backfield of which Patrick
and Shlaudeman were outstanding stars.
Faville, until then unheard of as
varsity material, played a remarkable
game at center. Fred Ludeke, guard on
last year's freshmen team, playing at
tackle, broke up play after play launched
by the opposition. The game was Stan
ford's from start to finish.
Fleet Downs Stanford
Stanford lost for the first and last
time of the season to the Pacific Fleet
the following week on a sloppy turf by
a scpre of 27 to 7. It was a case of too
much "Big Bill" Ingram, too much rain,
and too little ability to solve plays re
volving about the opposition's great
fullback. The mariners seemed quite
at home on the wet field, but it was an
entirely new sensation to the Cards and
a woeful lack of line-plunging ability
resulted. The Fleet had previously been
beaten by California by a score of 21-10
and was doped to defeat Stanford fully
as badly as it did. The dope bucket
regained its equilibrium for the first
time during the season only to be spilled
again the following week.
Doped to win by three touchdowns,
the Oregon Aggies lost to the Cards on
October 28, 14-7. The victory tied Stan
ford with California for the Coast Con
ference lead and marked the 1921 var
sity as an organization able to come up
from behind. As one sport critic put it,
"the Aggie game was a case of a faster,
cleverer organization pitted against a
heavier, overconfident team that was not
satisfied with a y<:>" The momentum
play, new to Stanford, was introduced
by Van Gent in this game and worked
time after time for big gains. The Ag
gies never punted until the fourth down,
regardless of position on the field,
striving until the end to overcome a tie
which ended up with a loss. Had the
Aggies kicked instead of passing on one
occasion with their backs to the goal
posts, Patrick would have never inter
cepted a pass that meant the winning

Registration day marked the opener
for the varsity against the Mare Island
Marines. Pigskin fans expected to see
the earth dusted off with the invaders'
moleskins and if a lopsided score of 41
to 0 means defeat, few were disap
pointed. Little but a strong defensive
was shown by the Cards in the first
two periods, but soon after the opening
of the third quarter, Van Gent's squad
galloped through the opposing line al
most at will, circled the ends and com
pleted passes sufficient in number to
ring up five touchdowns. Doughty was
the outstanding star of the season's
opener. Patrick and Wilcox were good
for yards every time they got the ball,
and Shlaudeman's accurate passes ac
counted for more than one gain that
meant a touchdown. There were those
who thought the score would have been
larger, but the showing was more than
satisfactory after two weeks of light
work.
St. Mary's failed to follow the ball in
its battle with the Cards the week fol
lowing, and although conceded a vic
tory by virtue of her ability to hold the
Bruin eleven to a 21-0 score the week
before, lost to the Red-shirts 7-10.
Stockton, Silva and Black in the Saints'
backfield rushed the Cards off their feet
at several times during the game, but
costly fumbles prevented them from
changing the story of defeat to one of
victory. A well-placed drop-kick by
Captain Jack Patrick, after a drive to
the Saints' ten-yard line, gave Stanford
the necessary points for a win. Pat
rick and Doughty in the backfield and
Carter and De Groot in the line starred
in this game.
A 7-0 score fails to tell the story of
a decisive victory over the Olympic Club
by the Cards on Ewing Field in San
Francisco on October 15. It was the
fust Stanford victory over the wearers
of the Winged "O" since the resump
tion of the American game on the Farm.
The Redshirts outplayed the clubmen at
all stages and in all phases of the con
test, with the result that an official of
the Club said after the game that Van

Gent had placed the Stanford varsity on
the 1921 football map.
The Card offense was vastly superior
to that of the Olympics. Huge holes
made by varsity linesmen were runways
for the fleet backfield of which Patrick
and Shlaudeman were outstanding stars.
Faville, until then unheard of as
varsity material, played a remarkable
game at center. Fred Ludeke, guard on
last year's freshmen team, playing at
tackle, broke up play after play launched
by the opposition. The game was Stan
ford's from start to finish.
Fleet Downs Stanford
Stanford lost for the first and last
time of the season to the Pacific Fleet
the following week on a sloppy turf by
a scpre of 27 to 7. It was a case of too
much "Big Bill" Ingram, too much rain,
and too little ability to solve plays re
volving about the opposition's great
fullback. The mariners seemed quite
at home on the wet field, but it was an
entirely new sensation to the Cards and
a woeful lack of line-plunging ability
resulted. The Fleet had previously been
beaten by California by a score of 21-10
and was doped to defeat Stanford fully
as badly as it did. The dope bucket
regained its equilibrium for the first
time during the season only to be spilled
again the following week.
Doped to win by three touchdowns,
the Oregon Aggies lost to the Cards on
October 28, 14-7. The victory tied Stan
ford with California for the Coast Con
ference lead and marked the 1921 var
sity as an organization able to come up
from behind. As one sport critic put it,
"the Aggie game was a case of a faster,
cleverer organization pitted against a
heavier, overconfident team that was not
satisfied with a y<:>" The momentum
play, new to Stanford, was introduced
by Van Gent in this game and worked
time after time for big gains. The Ag
gies never punted until the fourth down,
regardless of position on the field,
striving until the end to overcome a tie
which ended up with a loss. Had the
Aggies kicked instead of passing on one
occasion with their backs to the goal
posts, Patrick would have never inter
cepted a pass that meant the winning
touchdown.
The work of Wilcox in line-plunging,
Patrick's uncanny ability to pick out
enemy passes, and Shlaudeman's twist
ing run in returning punts were largely
responsible for a Cardinal victory.
There was no fluke about the game.
The breaks were even and the Aggies
failed to equal the Card standard in
any department.
Sun Dodgers Pull Surprise
A 0-0 draw resulted from the con
test with the University of Washington
the following week, despite predictions
that the Cards should win by three or
four touchdowns. The Aggies defeated
Washington 24-0 and the Cards had put
the Aggies to sleep, 14-7. Stanford, of
course, had a long trip, had little prac
tice following the Aggie game, Wilcox,
Carter and Ludeke were in poor shape,
and the field was strange, To make
matters worse, it rained and the Cards
were lost. However, the varsity made
• more yards from scrimmage and com
pleted more passes, besides endanger
ing the Sun Dodgers' goal three times
in the last quarter. The substitution of
Wilcox in the last period put more fire
in the team than a tankful of synthetic
gin. Washington fans threw up their
hands in despair as the Cards approached
the opposition's goal, and some of them
have never doped out yet why Stanford
didn't win when Betts caught a pass
over the line.
Even Coach Enoch VBagshaw as much
as admitted that the Cards could beat
the Sun Dodgers badly on their own
field or on any dry one. A wet ball to
a Stanford fan is like soap to a Bol
shevik. Stanford is plainly a dry land
place supporting a strictly a dry land
team. Aquatics never enters into the
game.
The dope bucket leaped into the air
and turned a complete somersault, spil
ling dope from Reno to Palo Alto when
Nevada held the Redshirts to a 14-14
tie last Saturday. The suprise at the
Washington game was scarcely explained
before the Nevada mystery presented
itself for explanation. Whatever may
have been the cause, it was certain that
the Cards were away off-form—appar
ently stale. They were not playing to
gether, and they did not seem to be
fighting as they fought against the Ag
gies and against St. Mary's. And be
sides, Van Gent was trying out a flock
of ends who, judging by all appearances,
offered scant improvement over the reg
ulars. Art Wilcox was not in the game
and those who saw him go at Seattle
when he was put in the last quarter will
vouch for the fact that his presence
would have made a big difference.
Ludeke was unable to play the whole
game, Betts did not get in, and in fact,
the team as a machine was simply not
there. Perhaps it's a good thing for
the varsity that the bad day came last
Saturday. Stanford usually has a bad
day in the preliminary season every
year, and there's no doubt that Saturday
was the prize of the lot. One good
thing about the game was the fact that
no serious injuries resulted. A squad that
is at least in fair physical condition will
meet California tomorrow and that is
more than Stanford has often been able
to say in the past.
Hakd Work Not Told
Four wins, two draws and a defeat
tell the story of the 1921 season for the
Cardinal eleven. Reviews of the games
and interviews with critics and authori
ties will never tell half the story of
the hard work, heavy season, handicaps
and eventual preliminary football su
premacy peculiar to the Stanford squad.
Words cannot tell a third of the story
of the difficulties encountered by the
coaching staff in building a varsity squad
from the material remaining from last
year. Stanford, in her third year of
American football, has reached a place
where she can claim football success.
California is universally acclaimed a
success and is an overwhelming favorite
for a win. Tomorrow puts brain and
brawn, man against man to the test. If
either team fails to give all it has, that
team will lose whether it wears the Red
or the Gold and Blue.
September 15 found over fifty old
men and new on the Stanford turf i
ready for the first workouts of the 1921 j
season. With the first to appear were j
the new coaches, Gene Van Gent and

test with the University of Washington
the following week, despite predictions
that the Cards should win by three or
four touchdowns. The Aggies defeated
Washington 24-0 and the Cards had put
the Aggies to sleep, 14-7. Stanford, of
course, had a long trip, had little prac
tice following the Aggie game, Wilcox,
Carter and Ludeke were in poor shape,
and the field was strange, To make
matters worse, it rained and the Cards
were lost. However, the varsity made
• more yards from scrimmage and com
pleted more passes, besides endanger
ing the Sun Dodgers' goal three times
in the last quarter. The substitution of
Wilcox in the last period put more fire
in the team than a tankful of synthetic
gin. Washington fans threw up their
hands in despair as the Cards approached
the opposition's goal, and some of them
have never doped out yet why Stanford
didn't win when Betts caught a pass
over the line.
Even Coach Enoch VBagshaw as much
as admitted that the Cards could beat
the Sun Dodgers badly on their own
field or on any dry one. A wet ball to
a Stanford fan is like soap to a Bol
shevik. Stanford is plainly a dry land
place supporting a strictly a dry land
team. Aquatics never enters into the
game.
The dope bucket leaped into the air
and turned a complete somersault, spil
ling dope from Reno to Palo Alto when
Nevada held the Redshirts to a 14-14
tie last Saturday. The suprise at the
Washington game was scarcely explained
before the Nevada mystery presented
itself for explanation. Whatever may
have been the cause, it was certain that
the Cards were away off-form—appar
ently stale. They were not playing to
gether, and they did not seem to be
fighting as they fought against the Ag
gies and against St. Mary's. And be
sides, Van Gent was trying out a flock
of ends who, judging by all appearances,
offered scant improvement over the reg
ulars. Art Wilcox was not in the game
and those who saw him go at Seattle
when he was put in the last quarter will
vouch for the fact that his presence
would have made a big difference.
Ludeke was unable to play the whole
game, Betts did not get in, and in fact,
the team as a machine was simply not
there. Perhaps it's a good thing for
the varsity that the bad day came last
Saturday. Stanford usually has a bad
day in the preliminary season every
year, and there's no doubt that Saturday
was the prize of the lot. One good
thing about the game was the fact that
no serious injuries resulted. A squad that
is at least in fair physical condition will
meet California tomorrow and that is
more than Stanford has often been able
to say in the past.
Hakd Work Not Told
Four wins, two draws and a defeat
tell the story of the 1921 season for the
Cardinal eleven. Reviews of the games
and interviews with critics and authori
ties will never tell half the story of
the hard work, heavy season, handicaps
and eventual preliminary football su
premacy peculiar to the Stanford squad.
Words cannot tell a third of the story
of the difficulties encountered by the
coaching staff in building a varsity squad
from the material remaining from last
year. Stanford, in her third year of
American football, has reached a place
where she can claim football success.
California is universally acclaimed a
success and is an overwhelming favorite
for a win. Tomorrow puts brain and
brawn, man against man to the test. If
either team fails to give all it has, that
team will lose whether it wears the Red
or the Gold and Blue.
September 15 found over fifty old
men and new on the Stanford turf i
ready for the first workouts of the 1921 j
season. With the first to appear were j
the new coaches, Gene Van Gent and
Joe Fitzgerald, together with "Dink" j
Templeton and J. B. Canning. Pros- j
pects for a successful season were
brighter than they have been for many ■
'a long day. Comment by sport critics
indicated more interest than ever in
football rivalry and Big Game enthu
siasm waxed warm from the first of the
grid season.
Registration day marked the opener
for the varsity against the Mare Island
Marines. Pigskin fans expected to see
the earth dusted off with the invaders'
moleskins and if a lopsided score of 41
to 0 means defeat, few were disap
pointed. Little but a strong defensive
was shown by the Cards in the first
two periods, but soon after the opening
of the third quarter, Van Gent's squad
galloped through the opposing line al
most at will, circled the ends and com
pleted passes sufficient in number to
ring up five touchdowns. Doughty was
the outstanding star of the season's
opener. Patrick and Wilcox were good
for yards every time they got the ball,
and Shlaudeman's accurate passes ac
counted for more than one gain that
meant a touchdown. There were those
who thought the score would have been
larger, but the showing was more than
satisfactory after two weeks of light
work.
St. Mary's failed to follow the ball in
its battle with the Cards the week fol
lowing, and although conceded a vic
tory by virtue of her ability to hold the
Bruin eleven to a 21-0 score the week
before, lost to the Red-shirts 7-10.
Stockton, Silva and Black in the Saints'
backfield rushed the Cards off their feet
at several times during the game, but
costly fumbles prevented them from
changing the story of defeat to one of
victory. A well-placed drop-kick by
Captain Jack Patrick, after a drive to
the Saints' ten-yard line, gave Stanford
the necessary points for a win. Pat
rick and Doughty in the backfield and
Carter and De Groot in the line starred
in this game.
A 7-0 score fails to tell the story of
a decisive victory over the Olympic Club
by the Cards on Ewing Field in San
Francisco on October 15. It was the
fust Stanford victory over the wearers
of the Winged "O" since the resump
tion of the American game on the Farm.
The Redshirts outplayed the clubmen at
all stages and in all phases of the con
test, with the result that an official of
the Club said after the game that Van

Gent had placed the Stanford varsity on
the 1921 football map.
The Card offense was vastly superior
to that of the Olympics. Huge holes
made by varsity linesmen were runways
for the fleet backfield of which Patrick
and Shlaudeman were outstanding stars.
Faville, until then unheard of as
varsity material, played a remarkable
game at center. Fred Ludeke, guard on
last year's freshmen team, playing at
tackle, broke up play after play launched
by the opposition. The game was Stan
ford's from start to finish.
Fleet Downs Stanford
Stanford lost for the first and last
time of the season to the Pacific Fleet
the following week on a sloppy turf by
a scpre of 27 to 7. It was a case of too
much "Big Bill" Ingram, too much rain,
and too little ability to solve plays re
volving about the opposition's great
fullback. The mariners seemed quite
at home on the wet field, but it was an
entirely new sensation to the Cards and
a woeful lack of line-plunging ability
resulted. The Fleet had previously been
beaten by California by a score of 21-10
and was doped to defeat Stanford fully
as badly as it did. The dope bucket
regained its equilibrium for the first
time during the season only to be spilled
again the following week.
Doped to win by three touchdowns,
the Oregon Aggies lost to the Cards on
October 28, 14-7. The victory tied Stan
ford with California for the Coast Con
ference lead and marked the 1921 var
sity as an organization able to come up
from behind. As one sport critic put it,
"the Aggie game was a case of a faster,
cleverer organization pitted against a
heavier, overconfident team that was not
satisfied with a y<:>" The momentum
play, new to Stanford, was introduced
by Van Gent in this game and worked
time after time for big gains. The Ag
gies never punted until the fourth down,
regardless of position on the field,
striving until the end to overcome a tie
which ended up with a loss. Had the
Aggies kicked instead of passing on one
occasion with their backs to the goal
posts, Patrick would have never inter
cepted a pass that meant the winning
touchdown.
The work of Wilcox in line-plunging,
Patrick's uncanny ability to pick out
enemy passes, and Shlaudeman's twist
ing run in returning punts were largely
responsible for a Cardinal victory.
There was no fluke about the game.
The breaks were even and the Aggies
failed to equal the Card standard in
any department.
