# STADIUM, READY FOR GAME, IS GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT
## 
### Bertha Vaughan, '22 
Strong, massive, and magnificent, a
true embodiment of the spirit which
made its being possible, the completed
Stanford stadium awaits the first enemy
invasion of its turf tomorrow.
Before another sunset the dedication
of the stadium will be completed. Six
teen years ago another Stanford foot
ball field was dedicated by a victory won
by a Cardinal team fighting against odds.
Today the Stanford varsity has that
same fight, and it will go up against
greater odds. The University and its
alumni stand as stalwart behind that
team as the huge mound which tomor
row will witness its glory, be it in vic
tory or in honorable defeat.
Completed just six months after the
building process began, the stadium
symbolizes the spirit of a university
which does things. It stands before the
world, the only great bowl of its kind
in the West, and second in size to but
one other in the country, as an accom
plishment significant of Stanford. From
the first moment the stadium was de
clared possible, there has been no falter
ing. It is a Stanford engineering feat
carried quietly, steadily, accurately, to
a successful ending.
To one who watched the first break
ing of the sod for the bowl last spring,
the felling of the trees, and the slow
upheaval of earth to the gradual prog
ress of dusty men and teams drawing
shape from a chaos of dirt, the finished
product is exulting; to those who see it
for the first time it is a revelation. The
sloping outer sides, covered with green
foliage offset by red-tipped posts, are
an invitation. The view from the top
of the bowl, which has a capacity of
65,000 people, down to the green turf
encircled by the red surfaced track, to
the open end where two giant flag-poles
stand as sentinels by the score board,
gives satisfaction.
The sunlight falling upon the bowl
brings out its huge proportions and ac
centuates the beauty of the greer. field
and Cardinal oval which look out uprn
the-Santa Clara hills to the east. Ir.

| the moonlight the structure seems even
more massive, with its background of
silhouetted trees rising beyond the long
rows of seats sloping to the field like
glistening waves turned back from a
darkened shore.
The stadium is a real Stanford prod
uct. Stanford men conceived it, Stan
ford men designed and put through its
construction, and the money and backing
of Stanford people made it possible fi
nancially.
To Professor Wing, especially, and
his engineering commission, Professor
Marx and Professor Durand, go the
honors for the plans and construction
of the stadium in record time. When
Professor Wing stood before a Stanford
audience at the first ground breaking
last spring it was difficult to visualize on
the barren field the structure which his
careful study and untiring efforts have
made a realiy. Professor Wing and his
cohorts have given Stanford a stadium
insured of permanence and safety from
fire or accident and so fitting to the
wide stretches of its campus and its
Romanisque architecture that it is diffi
cult to realize that it has not always
been a part of the landscape.
