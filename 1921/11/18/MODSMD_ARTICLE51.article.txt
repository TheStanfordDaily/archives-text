# BEARS WILL CROSS CARD'S GOAL FOUR TIMES-BRICK MORSE
## 
### "Brick" Morse 
San Francisco Call Staff.
I have been asked to give my opinion
on the game tomorrow.
My opinion is that California will win
by four touchdowns at least. I saw
Stanford play against the Oregon Ag
gies and I cannot figure how the Card
inal linesmen can hold back the power
ful charges of Barnes, McMillan, Berkey
and Stevens. Those men will crash
through and spoil Stanford's plays be
fore they can get started.
Wilcox and Shlaudeman are a great
pair of backs, probably equals in the
open field of any on the Coast, but what
can a good back do when tacklers are
sifting through onto him?
Stanford can not gain through the
California line. Her hope is in open
field play and forward passes. Stan
ford's forward passes are well executed
and she may be able to score through
that method. Then again a team with
such men as Shlaudeman and Wilcox
is always dangerous as far as scoring is
concerned. Stanford may score.
Stanford must remember that she is
up against a machine which is wonder
ful in its working. Every man on that
team is a star in his position and a per
fect cog in the machine.
