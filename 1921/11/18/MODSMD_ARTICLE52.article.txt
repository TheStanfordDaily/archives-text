# Soccer Team Will Meet U. C. Squad at Berkeley
## 
### Louis Bucklin, '24 
Tomorrow morning at 10:15 the
California soccer varsity will tangle
with the Cardinal eleven on the old
football turf. This game completes
the first half of the University and
Club Soccer League schedule for
Stanford, and it is this hurdle which
the varsity soccerites must take in
order to retain their lead for the
championship of the league. Student
body cards or 25 cents will admit to
the game.
California is now tied for second
place in the soccer league. In the
first part of the season the Bears
went down to defeat at the hands of
the San Francisco Olympic Club.
Since that time the Berkeley team
has shown steady improvement until
they are now tied with the Olympic
Club whom the Cards sent down to
their only defeat.
Last Saturday, California defeated
the Palo Alto post of the American
Legion, 3 to 0. This same legion team
tied Stanford 1 to 1, the week be
fore, but when the soldiers played
California they were not at their best,
due to several of their best players
being out with irijuries. Dope on
other games of the season shows that
the Stanford and the Blue and Gold
teams are about a stand-off, compara
tive scores giving the Cards a slight
edge.
Stanford's soccer team this year is
equally on a par with last year's cham
pionship team. Several men who
played on the varsity last year have
been crowded off the team by new
material and men from the 1924 soc
cer squad. As most of there men were
put in the line, the Stanford offensive
has been greatly strengthened.
