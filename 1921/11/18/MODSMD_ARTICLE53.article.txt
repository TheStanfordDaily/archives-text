# CLOSE SCORE WILL MARK CONTEST SAYS DAVIS OF BULLETIN
## 
### George T. Davis 
San Francisco Bulletin.
Tomorrow is the day of days so far
as the "local sporting element is con
cerned. There is no athletic event on
the Pacific Coast that rivals the annual
football classic between Stanford and
California. More interest is attached
to the contest this year than at any
other time, because it will mark the
opening of the new Stanford stadium,
setting a capacity record that would
have been unthought of not so many
years ago.
There have been games in the past
that were a great deal more promising
than tomorrow's affair from a stand
point of close competition. But it is
doubtful if any of the old games were'
fought any harder than the California
and Stanford teams will fight tomorrow
afternoon, before a crowd of over 60,000
people.
Stanford has the short end of an odd
chance that would take a miracle to be
upset. It is not in the cards for Stan
ford to dedicate its new stadium with a
win. No, the Cardinal students will be
forced to watch the Blue and Gold
rooters tear up the grass with their
snake dance after the game. That is,
unlessâ€”but there does not seem to be
even an outside chance of anything else
happening.
Although Stanford will likely finish
on the tail end of the score, it is very
doubtful if the final tally of the Bears
will be quite so large as many are led
to expect. There is something more
than relative scores that must be taken
into consideration. That is Stanford
Spirit.
Many people here in town believe that
the Stanford Spirit is a coined expres
sion, originating in the minds of certain
newspaper men. It is nothing of the
kind. It is something that is mighty
hard to explain but just seems to crop
up when things look the darkest. It
has stood the test too many times to
be anything else than a permanent
"something" that lies deep in the heart
of every Stanford man. That is why
the words Stanford and Spirit are usu
ally regarded as synonymous.
But even this cannot overcome the
great handicap that California will have
in tomorrow's game. The Bears have
been playing the American style of foot
ball since 1915, when it gave up the
rugby game, while Stanford's first at
tempt at American since the days of
rugby, was in 1918. The team that year,
however, was not representative as it
was made up of members of the Stu
dents' Army Training Corp, meaning
that the Cardinals have but two years
of football under their belts.
