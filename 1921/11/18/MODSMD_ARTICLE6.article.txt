# HURL DEFIANCE TO BLUE AND GOLD AT BIG ANNUAL RALLY
## 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
With all the pent-up enthusiasm ac
cumulated throughout the long prelim
inary football season, Stanford's student
body and alumni rocked the roof of the
Assembly Hall last night in a monster
rally that sent far out into the night
echoes of the defiance and determination
that California's eleven men must meet
in the depths of the new stadium to
morrow.
Grim determination to make the Bear
from Berkeley extend his utmost, what
ever the final outcome may be, was the
prevailing keynote. As Leland Cutler
said, "If those men of the Blue and
Gold come off the filtld at the end of
the game with any show of life left in
them, they will surely be a "wonder
team!" The mob of students on the
floor of the hall, up on their chairs in
an instant of frenzy of wild enthusiasm
whenever a speaker referred to the fight
that California will have on her hands,
gave full assurance that the team will
not be lacking in support when it goes
on the field tomorrow to do battle
against odds.
Leland Cutler, '06; Charles K. Field,
'95, and Ray Wilbur, '96, were the
alumni who spoke before the cheering
crowd that completely filled the lower
floor and the balcony above. Coach
Gene Van Gent, Assistant Coach Joe
Fitzgerald, and Trainer "Dad" Moulton
got their chances to tell their eager au
dience what shape the men are in, and
what may be expected of them tomor
row afternoon. Captain Jack Patrick
spoke on the way the team felt, and ex
pressed their determination to give all
in their power to make the dedication of
the stadium a fitting one.
"The power to brace," said Charley
Feld, '95, "is the thing which has often
brought the Cardinal to victory in the
face of overwhelming odds." lie told
how, in the first days of Stanford's ex
istence as a University, California ac
cepted a challenge from the Cardinal
football team and, with all the odds in
their favor, were beaten by a score of
14-10. the result of Stanford's "power
to brace."
"The stadium appears to me." he con
tinued, "as a huge volcano created by
an irresistible power. There are two
kinds of volcanoes. One gives off
swirling clouds of noxious blue and
yellow gases, and the other is a flaming
sea of molten cardinal. We shall know
which ours is on Saturday."
Ray Wilbur, '96, a freshman of what
Field termed "the upstart class of '96,"
spoke on the enviable reputation Stan
ford has acquired in the East through
the performances of her teams. He
cautioned against becoming discouraged
by temporary reverses. "The game is
only one battle in the campaign," he
said. "We want to build up a group of
athletes for future years as well, and
train them to win."
"The team is in better shape, phys
ically and mentally," said Coach Gene
Van Gent, "than they have been all
season. There is no Stanford player
who is going on that field with merely
the intention of holding California. They
are all going out to win!"
Assistant Coach Joe Fitzgerald ex
pressed the opinion that the Stanford
team have never been pushed to their
full extent, in practice or games. "The O.
A. C. game was their best game, and
they showed about 40 per cent of their
full strength in that game," he declared,
saying that the dope will mean nothing
tomorrow "if the men use all they have,
and don't come off until they have to be
carried off."

Leland Cutler, '06; Charles K. Field,
'95, and Ray Wilbur, '96, were the
alumni who spoke before the cheering
crowd that completely filled the lower
floor and the balcony above. Coach
Gene Van Gent, Assistant Coach Joe
Fitzgerald, and Trainer "Dad" Moulton
got their chances to tell their eager au
dience what shape the men are in, and
what may be expected of them tomor
row afternoon. Captain Jack Patrick
spoke on the way the team felt, and ex
pressed their determination to give all
in their power to make the dedication of
the stadium a fitting one.
"The power to brace," said Charley
Feld, '95, "is the thing which has often
brought the Cardinal to victory in the
face of overwhelming odds." lie told
how, in the first days of Stanford's ex
istence as a University, California ac
cepted a challenge from the Cardinal
football team and, with all the odds in
their favor, were beaten by a score of
14-10. the result of Stanford's "power
to brace."
"The stadium appears to me." he con
tinued, "as a huge volcano created by
an irresistible power. There are two
kinds of volcanoes. One gives off
swirling clouds of noxious blue and
yellow gases, and the other is a flaming
sea of molten cardinal. We shall know
which ours is on Saturday."
Ray Wilbur, '96, a freshman of what
Field termed "the upstart class of '96,"
spoke on the enviable reputation Stan
ford has acquired in the East through
the performances of her teams. He
cautioned against becoming discouraged
by temporary reverses. "The game is
only one battle in the campaign," he
said. "We want to build up a group of
athletes for future years as well, and
train them to win."
"The team is in better shape, phys
ically and mentally," said Coach Gene
Van Gent, "than they have been all
season. There is no Stanford player
who is going on that field with merely
the intention of holding California. They
are all going out to win!"
Assistant Coach Joe Fitzgerald ex
pressed the opinion that the Stanford
team have never been pushed to their
full extent, in practice or games. "The O.
A. C. game was their best game, and
they showed about 40 per cent of their
full strength in that game," he declared,
saying that the dope will mean nothing
tomorrow "if the men use all they have,
and don't come off until they have to be
carried off."

With all the pent-up enthusiasm ac
cumulated throughout the long prelim
inary football season, Stanford's student
body and alumni rocked the roof of the
Assembly Hall last night in a monster
rally that sent far out into the night
echoes of the defiance and determination
that California's eleven men must meet
in the depths of the new stadium to
morrow.
Grim determination to make the Bear
from Berkeley extend his utmost, what
ever the final outcome may be, was the
prevailing keynote. As Leland Cutler
said, "If those men of the Blue and
Gold come off the filtld at the end of
the game with any show of life left in
them, they will surely be a "wonder
team!" The mob of students on the
floor of the hall, up on their chairs in
an instant of frenzy of wild enthusiasm
whenever a speaker referred to the fight
that California will have on her hands,
gave full assurance that the team will
not be lacking in support when it goes
on the field tomorrow to do battle
against odds.
