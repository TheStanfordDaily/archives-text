# CALIFORNIA PLANES MAKE TWO ATTEMPTS TO IGNITE BONFIRE
## 
### 
Chalk up a defeat for the Gold and
Blue!
Two California airplanes, each bear
ing a red "S," made a futile attempt yes
terday at 4:30 to set the bonfire afire.
The planes dropped two bombs, both of
which fell within fifty feet of the struc
ture. Only one burst into flames. As
the fire had just been covered with oil,
about fifteen minutes before, there would
have been difficulty in suppressing the
flames, had the bomb hit the bonfire.
The two planes circled over the cam
pus for some time and then headed for
the bonfire. Flying low, they circled the
fire for several minutes be fort venturing
to shell it. The first projectile caught
fire as it hit the ground. The second
bomb failed to explode.
Made of small glass tubes, the bombs
contained a mixture of gasoline, ful
minate of magnesium and a small
amount of potassium.
Reports of the raid spread rapidly
over the campus. Within a quarter of
an hour the bonfire lot was covered
with students. A guard, r muted from
freshmen, was immrdi 'y stationed
around the fire.
