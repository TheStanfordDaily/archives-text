# RIVAL TEAMS LEAVE CAMP, GO INTO HIDING WITH BIGGEST OF BIG GAMES FEW HOURS AWAY
## Campbell May Start at End For Stanford; Andy Smith Hints That "Brick" Muller Will Be on Bench 
### E. C. WEST, '23 
Stanford and California await the climax of the 1921
football season.
Stanford awaits it as "the under dog" for the third time
in three years; California with its marvelous "wonder team"
is confident; 65,000 people are ready to fill the bleachers in
Stanford's New Stadium to watch the two teams battle in
the biggest of all Big Games.
The rival varsities are on edge for the contest. - Gene
Van Gent and his retinue of Cardinals are resting tonight
nearly forty miles from the Campus. Andy Smith and the
Bruins are at San Jose. Neither team will arrive here until
shortly before the game.
As the biggest of all big games nears, Stanford is ac
corded only a "fighting chance" and most of the so-called
experts deny Van Gent's team that. But Stanford has sel
dom entered any athletic contest on the long end of the dope
—never for many years in the past—but the records will
also show that dope is shaken as often as it is carried out.

The Cards must rest their chanccs to
win tomorrow on that "fighting chance.'*
There can be no doubt about that. Ac
cording to all (Tope, California should
win by thirty points at least.'" ■ •"
California is confident, Stanford is
hopeful, confident at least that fhe Stan
ford Spirit which has imbued te&my
for years past will still be there after
the Big Game tomorrow.
Both Coaches Andy Smith and Van
Gent have topped off the season's work,
The Big Game alone remains and then
the season is over exccpt that the win
ner will go to Pasadena on New Year's
Day.
It is believed that the Stanford team
that runs on the new turf about 2:30
tomorrow afternoon will be somewhat
different from what the dopesters figure.
Tonight it is all guess work. Nobody
knows who will start, save possibly Van
Gent, the silent one.
Persistent rumors continue that Stan
ford will have one new man, possibly
two, on the ends tomorrow afternoon.
The wings have been the weakest part
of the Stanford machine. No one will
deny that. With the Big Game a mat
ter of just a few hours, the ends who
will have much to do in stopping Don
Nichols and "Crip" Toomey arc un
decided.
Tonight it looks like "Shorty" Mertz
