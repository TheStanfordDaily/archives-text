# CHEERI-O REVUE SCORES SUCCESS ON CAMPUS STAGE
## Production Characterized by Splendid Acting and Good Music Under Coach L. Seib 
### Worth Wilson Caldwell, '24 
Hammer and Coffin achieved some
very extraordinary things in its big
football show, "The Cheerio Revue"
produced Saturday night in the As
sembly Hall, before one of the largest
and most appreciative audiences of
the year.
In the first place, the performance
began on time and that fact alone is
worthy of very favorable comment on
a campus where tardiness has been
practiced. Secondly, the sketches
comprising the big musical revue were
almost uniformly good and that fact,
too, is exceptional, as the acts were
unusually numerous and so varied.
All in all, it wau a good production,
and was a credit to Coach Lester Seib,
whose consistent effort and careful
coac.lv.ng made it the success that it
was. Possibly though, if criticism is
at all possible, it might be said that
the show was a trifle too long and
several of the before-the-curtain acts
might well have been shorn of some
superficial and tediouß lines.
The most novel and successful
sketch was the one entitled, "The
Princes of Garaustark." It furnished
more abundant material for real
humor than all the rest. The cast
put it over well. Paul Claflin was the
chief fun-maker and he kept the audi
ence convulsed with his droll remark,
always uttered plaintively and with
characteristic gestures, "Why didn't
you told me so?" Invariably, it came
at just the right moment and always
evoked a spontaneous laugh from the
spectators.
"Are the Smiths Brothers?" was an
>
prologue and epilogue were staged
other one of the hits of the evening.
Every bit of the action took place to
the hushed strains of a rustic melody
and every sentence was uttered in the
form of a jingle. The justly famous
Chappie beauty chorus was featured in
an act of their own called "Sweet
Sixteen." The popularity of this part
of the program was attested to by the
number of curtain calls demanded by
the enthusiastic audience. Both the
very effectively and realistically. All
the other sketches went over equally
big.
In a show of this kind, it is prac
tically impossible to designate any
single individuals as stars of the even
ing. Especially is this true, where the
cast numbers sixty-two people and so
many of them have appeared before
in other equally successful campus
productions. However, as an excep
tion to this rule stands Edythe Bay
liss, a newcomer to the Stanford stage
but undoubtedly the surprise of the
entire show. Although this is her
first appearance here, we venture the
prediction that it will not be her last
one. With an ease and assurance that
is seldom attained other than by pro
fessionals, she sang and danced her
way into the hearts of the audience.
She possesses a clear, yet sweet,
voice and is a truly marvelous dancer.
These valuable attributes coupled with
a pretty face and some exquisite cos
tumes made her, beyond a doubt, the
sensation of the evening.
Donaldine Cameron and Martha
Spangler both scored successes as the
leads in their respective playlets.
An excellent bit of acting was done
by Mildred Finley as the neglected
wife in the "Blue Envelope.The
other feminine roles, mostly of a minor
nature, were haidled equally as ef
ficiently.
The performance of the men showed
careful training and a great deal of
hard work. Nelson Valjean won
marked approval in a character part
in the playlet, "Impressing the Press."
Jack Heffernan gave a good imitation
of the famous Stanford "Chappie" and
maintained- it consistently through
out. The Arkansas Traveler was typi
fied by Arnold Bayley in a ludicrous,
but highly successful, manner. Hal
Bumbaugh, James Lawyer, Cecil Mor
ris and Ted Sterling all carried their
respective parts well.
Nathanson, Mertz and Alabaster, as
the Singing Saxophonists lived up to
their reputations as musicians. The
Kemnitzer Brothers brought college
memories back to many a gray-haired
father in the house, and did it effect
ively, too. The technical staff deserv
es a great deal of credit for the ex
cellent manner in which they staged
the production.
Taking it all in all, the Chappie
Football Show was so good and scor
ed such a success, that it is hoped
that it shall each year be made an
aftermath of the Big Game.

Every bit of the action took place to
the hushed strains of a rustic melody
and every sentence was uttered in the
form of a jingle. The justly famous
Chappie beauty chorus was featured in
an act of their own called "Sweet
Sixteen." The popularity of this part
of the program was attested to by the
number of curtain calls demanded by
the enthusiastic audience. Both the
very effectively and realistically. All
the other sketches went over equally
big.
In a show of this kind, it is prac
tically impossible to designate any
single individuals as stars of the even
ing. Especially is this true, where the
cast numbers sixty-two people and so
many of them have appeared before
in other equally successful campus
productions. However, as an excep
tion to this rule stands Edythe Bay
liss, a newcomer to the Stanford stage
but undoubtedly the surprise of the
entire show. Although this is her
first appearance here, we venture the
prediction that it will not be her last
one. With an ease and assurance that
is seldom attained other than by pro
fessionals, she sang and danced her
way into the hearts of the audience.
She possesses a clear, yet sweet,
voice and is a truly marvelous dancer.
These valuable attributes coupled with
a pretty face and some exquisite cos
tumes made her, beyond a doubt, the
sensation of the evening.
Donaldine Cameron and Martha
Spangler both scored successes as the
leads in their respective playlets.
An excellent bit of acting was done
by Mildred Finley as the neglected
wife in the "Blue Envelope.The
other feminine roles, mostly of a minor
nature, were haidled equally as ef
ficiently.
The performance of the men showed
careful training and a great deal of
hard work. Nelson Valjean won
marked approval in a character part
in the playlet, "Impressing the Press."
Jack Heffernan gave a good imitation
of the famous Stanford "Chappie" and
maintained- it consistently through
out. The Arkansas Traveler was typi
fied by Arnold Bayley in a ludicrous,
but highly successful, manner. Hal
Bumbaugh, James Lawyer, Cecil Mor
ris and Ted Sterling all carried their
respective parts well.
Nathanson, Mertz and Alabaster, as
the Singing Saxophonists lived up to
their reputations as musicians. The
Kemnitzer Brothers brought college
memories back to many a gray-haired
father in the house, and did it effect
ively, too. The technical staff deserv
es a great deal of credit for the ex
cellent manner in which they staged
the production.
Taking it all in all, the Chappie
Football Show was so good and scor
ed such a success, that it is hoped
that it shall each year be made an
aftermath of the Big Game.
Hammer and Coffin achieved some
very extraordinary things in its big
football show, "The Cheerio Revue"
produced Saturday night in the As
sembly Hall, before one of the largest
and most appreciative audiences of
the year.
In the first place, the performance
began on time and that fact alone is
worthy of very favorable comment on
a campus where tardiness has been
practiced. Secondly, the sketches
comprising the big musical revue were
almost uniformly good and that fact,
too, is exceptional, as the acts were
unusually numerous and so varied.
All in all, it wau a good production,
and was a credit to Coach Lester Seib,
whose consistent effort and careful
coac.lv.ng made it the success that it
was. Possibly though, if criticism is
at all possible, it might be said that
the show was a trifle too long and
several of the before-the-curtain acts
might well have been shorn of some
superficial and tediouß lines.
The most novel and successful
sketch was the one entitled, "The
Princes of Garaustark." It furnished
more abundant material for real
humor than all the rest. The cast
put it over well. Paul Claflin was the
chief fun-maker and he kept the audi
ence convulsed with his droll remark,
always uttered plaintively and with
characteristic gestures, "Why didn't
you told me so?" Invariably, it came
at just the right moment and always
evoked a spontaneous laugh from the
spectators.
