Hammer and Coffin achieved some
very extraordinary things in its big

Every bit of the action took place to
the hushed strains of a rustic melody
and every sentence was uttered in the
form of a jingle. The justly famous
Chappie beauty chorus was featured in
an act of their own called "Sweet
Sixteen." The popularity of this part
of the program was attested to by the
number of curtain calls demanded by
the enthusiastic audience. Both the
