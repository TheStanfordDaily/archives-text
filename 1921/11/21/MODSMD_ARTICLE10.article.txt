# SOPHOMORE WOMEN WIN FROM CALIFORNIA
## Stanford Seniors Lose to Blue and Gold Team in the Final Intercollegiate Competition 
### Katharine Calhoun, '24 
Concluding the intercollegiate women's
hockey series for the season, the Stan
ford sophomore team defeated the Cali
fornia freshmen squad with a score of
6-1, while the California seniors won
with a 4-1 score over the Stanford
seniors.
Never before have the underclass
women displayed such perfect team
work. Plays were made with clock
work speed, breaking up forward runs
on the part of California and following
up balls for goals. Grace Strobel was
the star of the team, making four goals
out of the six, by clever dribbling and
accurate shots. Ruth Jameson, left
wing, played a consistent game with
fine dribbling. She scored the first point
for Stanford, immediately followed,
however, by California's goal in the fast
work of Dorothy Jarman. The forwards
on the Blue and Gold squad did fine
passing throughout the game.
Grace Strobel made three goals by the
end of the first half, the halves and full
backs having put up a strong defense.
California made a futile attempt at a
goal toward the end of the game, but
Alice Roth broke up the final shot. Cali
fornia played harder in the second half
but was unable to get by the Stanford
defense for a goal. Isabelle Muzzey
and Grace Strobel shot two more points
for the Cardinal women, giving them
the final 6-1 score.
The California seniors showed fine
teamwork against the Stanford '22 squad.
Their strength lay in the forwards who
played consistently and fast. F.dna
Cruess proved herself the star by shoot
ing three out of the four goals in Cali
fornia's favor. Following the first point
made by the rival team, Stanford
brought the ball down the field for a
goal by Marion Dwight, right inside.
Carey Bailard made quick, hard shots
in passes but Stanford defense could not
keep the Californians from scoring twice
by the end of the first half.
The second half started with a spec
tacular steal by Norman Wingood,
Stanford fullback. Shooting the ball out
of danger to Elgie Miller, who dribbled
it thirty yards. Miriam Seelig, goaler,
guarded well when California made nu
merous shots at the goal. Carey Bail
ard's long, swift shots out of danger
were potent factors in keeping the Cali
fornia score down. The final score
was 4-1 in favor of California.
