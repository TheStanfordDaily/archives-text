# CALIFORNIA WINS FIRST GAME IN NEW STADIUM, 42-7, TAKING PACIFIC COAST FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FOR 1921
## Cardinal Eleven Makes First Score But Experience of Bear Wonder Team Proves Its Superiority 
### (By E. C. WEST, '23 
CALIFORNIA, 42; STANFORD, 7.
That tells how a machine defeated a flood football team, Saturday aft
ernoon, in the Stanford Stadium.
It is a cruel story. The Stanford varsity did all that eleven men could
have done. The fault was not theirs, nor with their playing or their coaching.
The California machine was bigger, more experienced. The better team won.
Yet the Stanford Stadium, packed save for two sections which would have
been filled, was dedicated after two minutes of play by a Stanford score.
That was the only Cardinal flash of the afternoon. The "wonder team,"
failing to get the breaks of the game for the first time in two years, opened
the throttle of their great machine. Five minutes later, the Immense throng
knew which team was the stronger, knew which team would win.
No one wih deny, after Saturday, that the Bruins have a "wonder team."
They had no plays that surprised the Cards. They did not need them to
gain... They would not need them against any team in the country. Their 1
touchdowns are a record of a fast tractor moving over all obstacles until
the goal is reached. _

Stanford fought desperately. There
is no disgrace in her defeat. Any team
in the country would have gone down
before the California avalanche Sat
urday.
Bob Shlaudeman was the Cardinal
star. He did what the critics said
couldn't be done. Time after time
the Stanford quarterback would elude
the Bruin ends and carry Nisbet's long
punts back for substantial advances.
His work on defense was perfect.
Dud Dc Groot, Stanford center, played
his best game of the season. He was
up against the California captain,
Latham, perhaps the strongest cog in
the strongest part of the California
machine line. Yet an analysis of the
game shows that no gains were made
through the center of the Card line.
Captain Jack Patrick, "Red" Betts
and Fred Ludeke were others who
showed up to advantage on the Stan
ford team.
Picking the fetars of the California
team would be like selecting the best
part of a machine. Toomey, although
he fumbled badly at the start of the
game, made good gains later in the
afternoon. Nichols was California's
hardest man to stop. Nisbet kicked
well. Muller and Berkey on the ends
stopped every attempt of the fast Card
backs to get past the line of scrim
mage and into the open where Stan
ford hoped to do her gaining.
Stanford got the first break of the
game at the outset and was able to
take advantage of it.
Joe Douglas kicked off to Toomey.
The Bruin halfback had carried the
ball a distance of about ten yards
when he was heavily tackled by one
of the charging Cards. He fumbled
the ball. Stanford recovered on the
California two-yard line.
Three vicious thrusts at the Bruin
line put the ball one foot away from
the last mark. On the fourth down,
Art Wilcox threw himself over the line
of scrimmage and Stanford had scored.
The goal was kicked.
Doughty ran the California kick-off
back to the Cardinal 27-yard line. On
the third play Wilcox kicked to
Nichols. When the California star
was tackled he dropped the ball and
Stanford recovered in the middle of
the field.
On the first play Wilcox ran through
a broken field on a trick play for fifteen
yards and first down.
That was the last of the Stanford
flash. On the next play, Wilcox fum
bled and California recovered on her
38-yard line.
Nisbet immediately kicked to Shlaude
man who fumbled but recovered. An
exchange of punts gave the Bruins the
advantage, Nichols finally catching a
short one by ilcox and running it in
to the Cardinals' 22-yard line. Toomey
went for three yards and Stanford was
penalized five for offside play. Nisbet
and Nichols carried the ball to the 5-
yard line in three* plays. Toomey then
carried it over and Erb converted, tieing
the score.
The first quarter ended soon after
ward.
California got the next break of the
game and it led to her second touch
down.
On the fourth down, with eight yards
to go, Art Wilcox was caught with the
ball in his hands 011 Stanford's 33-yard
line. He did not have time to kick.
Nichols and Toomey ran the ball in
three plays, along with a 5-yard penalty,
to the Cards' 12-yard line. On the next
play, Nichols ran around the Stanford
right end on a criss-cross for a touch
down. Erb converted.
Erb ran Douglas' kick-off back to
his 35-yard line. Nisbet made twelve
yards. Erb went for three and Toomey
for two. A short pass was grounded
and Nisbet kicked over the Stanford
goal.
Clarke broke through and blocked a
punt by Wilcox who recovered for Stan
ford out of bounds. Wilcox then kicked
short to Nichols who was thrown off
side on the Stanford 38-yard line.
Toomey made four yards and Stan
ford was penalized fifteen yards for
holding. Nichols made five yards on a

criss-cross and Nisbet took the ball to
Stanford's 15-yard line.
Toomey and Nichols went for short
i gains and Nisbet plunged over tackle for
eight yards and a touchdown. Erb con
verted, making the score 21-7.
Douglas kicked off to Nichols, who
ran the ball back to his 32-yard line.
Shlaudeman intercepted a long pass but
the ball was taken back and Stanford
again penalized. California failed to
gain and Nisbet kicked to Shlaudeman
who fumbled but recovered on Stan
ford's 30-yard mark.
Patrick failed to gain; Wilcox made
! three. On a fake kick Wilcox ran five
yards. California was penalized five
yards, giving Stanford first down.
California held and Wilcox went back
to punt. Berkey went through and
dropped him for a 10-yard loss before
he could kick. This gave the Bruins
the ball on Stanford's 28-yard line.
Muller, who substituted for Stephens,
nailed a pass for a 10-yard advance.
Toomey went for'two. On the next
play, Nichols caught a screen pass for
a touchdown but Muller was offside
and California was penalized five yards
from the line of scrimmage.
Muller then got another pass for a
10-yard gain, which gave California first
down on Stanford's 4-yard line. Toomey
circled right end for a touchdown on
the next play. Erb converted. The
half ended a minute later with the score
28-7 in favor of California.
Nisbet kicked over the Cardinal goal
line to start the second half. Wilcox
punted offside on Stanford's 42-yard

hit the Stanford line three times and
carried the ball to the 1-yard line. On
the fourth down he bucked it over
tackle. Erb converted.
There was no more scoring during the
period, neither side being able to make
yardage.
Dunn made the last Bruin score in
the middle of the fourth quarter after
the California backs had worked the
ball from the middle of the field to the
5-yard line. Erb converted, making the
scoreboard read California 42, Stan
ford 7.

CALIFORNIA, 42; STANFORD, 7.
That tells how a machine defeated a flood football team, Saturday aft
ernoon, in the Stanford Stadium.
It is a cruel story. The Stanford varsity did all that eleven men could
have done. The fault was not theirs, nor with their playing or their coaching.
The California machine was bigger, more experienced. The better team won.
Yet the Stanford Stadium, packed save for two sections which would have
been filled, was dedicated after two minutes of play by a Stanford score.
That was the only Cardinal flash of the afternoon. The "wonder team,"
failing to get the breaks of the game for the first time in two years, opened
the throttle of their great machine. Five minutes later, the Immense throng
knew which team was the stronger, knew which team would win.
No one wih deny, after Saturday, that the Bruins have a "wonder team."
They had no plays that surprised the Cards. They did not need them to
gain... They would not need them against any team in the country. Their 1
touchdowns are a record of a fast tractor moving over all obstacles until
the goal is reached. _

Stanford fought desperately. There
is no disgrace in her defeat. Any team
in the country would have gone down
before the California avalanche Sat
urday.
Bob Shlaudeman was the Cardinal
star. He did what the critics said
couldn't be done. Time after time
the Stanford quarterback would elude
the Bruin ends and carry Nisbet's long
punts back for substantial advances.
His work on defense was perfect.
Dud Dc Groot, Stanford center, played
his best game of the season. He was
up against the California captain,
Latham, perhaps the strongest cog in
the strongest part of the California
machine line. Yet an analysis of the
game shows that no gains were made
through the center of the Card line.
Captain Jack Patrick, "Red" Betts
and Fred Ludeke were others who
showed up to advantage on the Stan
ford team.
Picking the fetars of the California
team would be like selecting the best
part of a machine. Toomey, although
he fumbled badly at the start of the
game, made good gains later in the
afternoon. Nichols was California's
hardest man to stop. Nisbet kicked
well. Muller and Berkey on the ends
stopped every attempt of the fast Card
backs to get past the line of scrim
mage and into the open where Stan
ford hoped to do her gaining.
Stanford got the first break of the
game at the outset and was able to
take advantage of it.
Joe Douglas kicked off to Toomey.
The Bruin halfback had carried the
ball a distance of about ten yards
when he was heavily tackled by one
of the charging Cards. He fumbled
the ball. Stanford recovered on the
California two-yard line.
Three vicious thrusts at the Bruin
line put the ball one foot away from
the last mark. On the fourth down,
Art Wilcox threw himself over the line
of scrimmage and Stanford had scored.
The goal was kicked.
Doughty ran the California kick-off
back to the Cardinal 27-yard line. On
the third play Wilcox kicked to
Nichols. When the California star
was tackled he dropped the ball and
Stanford recovered in the middle of
the field.
On the first play Wilcox ran through
a broken field on a trick play for fifteen
yards and first down.
That was the last of the Stanford
flash. On the next play, Wilcox fum
bled and California recovered on her
38-yard line.
Nisbet immediately kicked to Shlaude
man who fumbled but recovered. An
exchange of punts gave the Bruins the
advantage, Nichols finally catching a
short one by ilcox and running it in
to the Cardinals' 22-yard line. Toomey
went for three yards and Stanford was
penalized five for offside play. Nisbet
and Nichols carried the ball to the 5-
yard line in three* plays. Toomey then
carried it over and Erb converted, tieing
the score.
The first quarter ended soon after
ward.
California got the next break of the
game and it led to her second touch
down.
On the fourth down, with eight yards
to go, Art Wilcox was caught with the
ball in his hands 011 Stanford's 33-yard
line. He did not have time to kick.
Nichols and Toomey ran the ball in
three plays, along with a 5-yard penalty,
to the Cards' 12-yard line. On the next
play, Nichols ran around the Stanford
right end on a criss-cross for a touch
down. Erb converted.
Erb ran Douglas' kick-off back to
his 35-yard line. Nisbet made twelve
yards. Erb went for three and Toomey
for two. A short pass was grounded
and Nisbet kicked over the Stanford
goal.
Clarke broke through and blocked a
punt by Wilcox who recovered for Stan
ford out of bounds. Wilcox then kicked
short to Nichols who was thrown off
side on the Stanford 38-yard line.
Toomey made four yards and Stan
ford was penalized fifteen yards for
holding. Nichols made five yards on a

criss-cross and Nisbet took the ball to
Stanford's 15-yard line.
Toomey and Nichols went for short
i gains and Nisbet plunged over tackle for
eight yards and a touchdown. Erb con
verted, making the score 21-7.
Douglas kicked off to Nichols, who
ran the ball back to his 32-yard line.
Shlaudeman intercepted a long pass but
the ball was taken back and Stanford
again penalized. California failed to
gain and Nisbet kicked to Shlaudeman
who fumbled but recovered on Stan
ford's 30-yard mark.
Patrick failed to gain; Wilcox made
! three. On a fake kick Wilcox ran five
yards. California was penalized five
yards, giving Stanford first down.
California held and Wilcox went back
to punt. Berkey went through and
dropped him for a 10-yard loss before
he could kick. This gave the Bruins
the ball on Stanford's 28-yard line.
Muller, who substituted for Stephens,
nailed a pass for a 10-yard advance.
Toomey went for'two. On the next
play, Nichols caught a screen pass for
a touchdown but Muller was offside
and California was penalized five yards
from the line of scrimmage.
Muller then got another pass for a
10-yard gain, which gave California first
down on Stanford's 4-yard line. Toomey
circled right end for a touchdown on
the next play. Erb converted. The
half ended a minute later with the score
28-7 in favor of California.
Nisbet kicked over the Cardinal goal
line to start the second half. Wilcox
punted offside on Stanford's 42-yard
line.

CALIFORNIA, 42; STANFORD, 7.
That tells how a machine defeated a flood football team, Saturday aft
ernoon, in the Stanford Stadium.
It is a cruel story. The Stanford varsity did all that eleven men could
have done. The fault was not theirs, nor with their playing or their coaching.
The California machine was bigger, more experienced. The better team won.
Yet the Stanford Stadium, packed save for two sections which would have
been filled, was dedicated after two minutes of play by a Stanford score.
That was the only Cardinal flash of the afternoon. The "wonder team,"
failing to get the breaks of the game for the first time in two years, opened
the throttle of their great machine. Five minutes later, the Immense throng
knew which team was the stronger, knew which team would win.
No one wih deny, after Saturday, that the Bruins have a "wonder team."
They had no plays that surprised the Cards. They did not need them to
gain... They would not need them against any team in the country. Their 1
touchdowns are a record of a fast tractor moving over all obstacles until
the goal is reached. _

Stanford fought desperately. There
is no disgrace in her defeat. Any team
in the country would have gone down
before the California avalanche Sat
urday.
Bob Shlaudeman was the Cardinal
star. He did what the critics said
couldn't be done. Time after time
the Stanford quarterback would elude
the Bruin ends and carry Nisbet's long
punts back for substantial advances.
His work on defense was perfect.
Dud Dc Groot, Stanford center, played
his best game of the season. He was
up against the California captain,
Latham, perhaps the strongest cog in
the strongest part of the California
machine line. Yet an analysis of the
game shows that no gains were made
through the center of the Card line.
Captain Jack Patrick, "Red" Betts
and Fred Ludeke were others who
showed up to advantage on the Stan
ford team.
Picking the fetars of the California
team would be like selecting the best
part of a machine. Toomey, although
he fumbled badly at the start of the
game, made good gains later in the
afternoon. Nichols was California's
hardest man to stop. Nisbet kicked
well. Muller and Berkey on the ends
stopped every attempt of the fast Card
backs to get past the line of scrim
mage and into the open where Stan
ford hoped to do her gaining.
Stanford got the first break of the
game at the outset and was able to
take advantage of it.
Joe Douglas kicked off to Toomey.
The Bruin halfback had carried the
ball a distance of about ten yards
when he was heavily tackled by one
of the charging Cards. He fumbled
the ball. Stanford recovered on the
California two-yard line.
Three vicious thrusts at the Bruin
line put the ball one foot away from
the last mark. On the fourth down,
Art Wilcox threw himself over the line
of scrimmage and Stanford had scored.
The goal was kicked.
Doughty ran the California kick-off
back to the Cardinal 27-yard line. On
the third play Wilcox kicked to
Nichols. When the California star
was tackled he dropped the ball and
Stanford recovered in the middle of
the field.
On the first play Wilcox ran through
a broken field on a trick play for fifteen
yards and first down.
That was the last of the Stanford
flash. On the next play, Wilcox fum
bled and California recovered on her
38-yard line.
Nisbet immediately kicked to Shlaude
man who fumbled but recovered. An
exchange of punts gave the Bruins the
advantage, Nichols finally catching a
short one by ilcox and running it in
to the Cardinals' 22-yard line. Toomey
went for three yards and Stanford was
penalized five for offside play. Nisbet
and Nichols carried the ball to the 5-
yard line in three* plays. Toomey then
carried it over and Erb converted, tieing
the score.
The first quarter ended soon after
ward.
California got the next break of the
game and it led to her second touch
down.
On the fourth down, with eight yards
to go, Art Wilcox was caught with the
ball in his hands 011 Stanford's 33-yard
line. He did not have time to kick.
Nichols and Toomey ran the ball in
three plays, along with a 5-yard penalty,
to the Cards' 12-yard line. On the next
play, Nichols ran around the Stanford
right end on a criss-cross for a touch
down. Erb converted.
Erb ran Douglas' kick-off back to
his 35-yard line. Nisbet made twelve
yards. Erb went for three and Toomey
for two. A short pass was grounded
and Nisbet kicked over the Stanford
goal.
Clarke broke through and blocked a
punt by Wilcox who recovered for Stan
ford out of bounds. Wilcox then kicked
short to Nichols who was thrown off
side on the Stanford 38-yard line.
Toomey made four yards and Stan
ford was penalized fifteen yards for
holding. Nichols made five yards on a

criss-cross and Nisbet took the ball to
Stanford's 15-yard line.
Toomey and Nichols went for short
i gains and Nisbet plunged over tackle for
eight yards and a touchdown. Erb con
verted, making the score 21-7.
Douglas kicked off to Nichols, who
ran the ball back to his 32-yard line.
Shlaudeman intercepted a long pass but
the ball was taken back and Stanford
again penalized. California failed to
gain and Nisbet kicked to Shlaudeman
who fumbled but recovered on Stan
ford's 30-yard mark.
Patrick failed to gain; Wilcox made

CALIFORNIA, 42; STANFORD, 7.
That tells how a machine defeated a flood football team, Saturday aft
ernoon, in the Stanford Stadium.
It is a cruel story. The Stanford varsity did all that eleven men could
have done. The fault was not theirs, nor with their playing or their coaching.
The California machine was bigger, more experienced. The better team won.
Yet the Stanford Stadium, packed save for two sections which would have
been filled, was dedicated after two minutes of play by a Stanford score.
That was the only Cardinal flash of the afternoon. The "wonder team,"
failing to get the breaks of the game for the first time in two years, opened
the throttle of their great machine. Five minutes later, the Immense throng
knew which team was the stronger, knew which team would win.
No one wih deny, after Saturday, that the Bruins have a "wonder team."
They had no plays that surprised the Cards. They did not need them to
gain... They would not need them against any team in the country. Their 1
touchdowns are a record of a fast tractor moving over all obstacles until
the goal is reached. _

Stanford fought desperately. There
is no disgrace in her defeat. Any team
in the country would have gone down
before the California avalanche Sat
urday.
Bob Shlaudeman was the Cardinal
star. He did what the critics said
couldn't be done. Time after time
the Stanford quarterback would elude
the Bruin ends and carry Nisbet's long
punts back for substantial advances.
His work on defense was perfect.
Dud Dc Groot, Stanford center, played
his best game of the season. He was
up against the California captain,
Latham, perhaps the strongest cog in
the strongest part of the California
machine line. Yet an analysis of the
game shows that no gains were made
through the center of the Card line.
Captain Jack Patrick, "Red" Betts
and Fred Ludeke were others who
showed up to advantage on the Stan
ford team.
Picking the fetars of the California
team would be like selecting the best
part of a machine. Toomey, although
he fumbled badly at the start of the
game, made good gains later in the
afternoon. Nichols was California's
hardest man to stop. Nisbet kicked
well. Muller and Berkey on the ends
stopped every attempt of the fast Card
backs to get past the line of scrim
mage and into the open where Stan
ford hoped to do her gaining.
Stanford got the first break of the
game at the outset and was able to
take advantage of it.
Joe Douglas kicked off to Toomey.
The Bruin halfback had carried the
ball a distance of about ten yards
when he was heavily tackled by one
of the charging Cards. He fumbled
the ball. Stanford recovered on the
California two-yard line.
Three vicious thrusts at the Bruin
line put the ball one foot away from
the last mark. On the fourth down,
Art Wilcox threw himself over the line
of scrimmage and Stanford had scored.
The goal was kicked.
Doughty ran the California kick-off
back to the Cardinal 27-yard line. On
the third play Wilcox kicked to
Nichols. When the California star
was tackled he dropped the ball and
Stanford recovered in the middle of
the field.
On the first play Wilcox ran through
a broken field on a trick play for fifteen
yards and first down.
That was the last of the Stanford
flash. On the next play, Wilcox fum
bled and California recovered on her
38-yard line.
Nisbet immediately kicked to Shlaude
man who fumbled but recovered. An
exchange of punts gave the Bruins the
advantage, Nichols finally catching a
short one by ilcox and running it in
to the Cardinals' 22-yard line. Toomey
went for three yards and Stanford was
penalized five for offside play. Nisbet
and Nichols carried the ball to the 5-
yard line in three* plays. Toomey then
carried it over and Erb converted, tieing
the score.
The first quarter ended soon after
ward.
California got the next break of the
game and it led to her second touch
down.
On the fourth down, with eight yards
to go, Art Wilcox was caught with the
ball in his hands 011 Stanford's 33-yard
line. He did not have time to kick.
Nichols and Toomey ran the ball in
three plays, along with a 5-yard penalty,
to the Cards' 12-yard line. On the next
play, Nichols ran around the Stanford
right end on a criss-cross for a touch
down. Erb converted.

his 35-yard line. Nisbet made twelve
yards. Erb went for three and Toomey
for two. A short pass was grounded
