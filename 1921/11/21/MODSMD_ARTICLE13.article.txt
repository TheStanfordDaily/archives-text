# CALIFORNIA WINS FIRST GAME IN NEW STADIUM, 42-7, TAKING PACIFIC COAST FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FOR 1921
## Cardinal Eleven Makes First Score But Experience of Bear Wonder Team Proves Its Superiority

CALIFORNIA, 42; STANFORD, 7.
That tells how a machine defeated a flood football team, Saturday aft
ernoon, in the Stanford Stadium.
It is a cruel story. The Stanford varsity did all that eleven men could
have done. The fault was not theirs, nor with their playing or their coaching.
The California machine was bigger, more experienced. The better team won.
Yet the Stanford Stadium, packed save for two sections which would have
been filled, was dedicated after two minutes of play by a Stanford score.
That was the only Cardinal flash of the afternoon. The "wonder team,"
failing to get the breaks of the game for the first time in two years, opened
the throttle of their great machine. Five minutes later, the Immense throng
knew which team was the stronger, knew which team would win.
No one wih deny, after Saturday, that the Bruins have a "wonder team."
They had no plays that surprised the Cards. They did not need them to
gain... They would not need them against any team in the country. Their 1
touchdowns are a record of a fast tractor moving over all obstacles until
the goal is reached. _

Stanford fought desperately. There
is no disgrace in her defeat. Any team
in the country would have gone down
before the California avalanche Sat
urday.
Bob Shlaudeman was the Cardinal
star. He did what the critics said
couldn't be done. Time after time
the Stanford quarterback would elude
the Bruin ends and carry Nisbet's long
punts back for substantial advances.
His work on defense was perfect.
Dud Dc Groot, Stanford center, played
his best game of the season. He was
up against the California captain,
Latham, perhaps the strongest cog in
the strongest part of the California
machine line. Yet an analysis of the
game shows that no gains were made
through the center of the Card line.
Captain Jack Patrick, "Red" Betts
and Fred Ludeke were others who
showed up to advantage on the Stan
ford team.
Picking the fetars of the California
team would be like selecting the best
part of a machine. Toomey, although
he fumbled badly at the start of the
game, made good gains later in the
afternoon. Nichols was California's
hardest man to stop. Nisbet kicked
well. Muller and Berkey on the ends
stopped every attempt of the fast Card
backs to get past the line of scrim
mage and into the open where Stan
ford hoped to do her gaining.
Stanford got the first break of the
game at the outset and was able to
take advantage of it.
Joe Douglas kicked off to Toomey.
The Bruin halfback had carried the
ball a distance of about ten yards
when he was heavily tackled by one
of the charging Cards. He fumbled
the ball. Stanford recovered on the
California two-yard line.
Three vicious thrusts at the Bruin
line put the ball one foot away from
the last mark. On the fourth down,
Art Wilcox threw himself over the line
of scrimmage and Stanford had scored.
The goal was kicked.
Doughty ran the California kick-off
back to the Cardinal 27-yard line. On
the third play Wilcox kicked to
Nichols. When the California star
was tackled he dropped the ball and
Stanford recovered in the middle of
the field.
On the first play Wilcox ran through
a broken field on a trick play for fifteen
yards and first down.
That was the last of the Stanford
flash. On the next play, Wilcox fum
bled and California recovered on her
38-yard line.
Nisbet immediately kicked to Shlaude
man who fumbled but recovered. An
exchange of punts gave the Bruins the
