# TOMORROW IS RED CROSS BUTTON DAY
## 
### 
Wear your button! A Red Cross on
every coat will be Stanford's answer to
morrow to the fifth annual roll call for
the American Red Cross, if the cam
paign which is being held on the cam
pus this week under the auspices of
Women's Service Board is as successful
as the committee aims to make it.
With tomorrow designated as button
day, it is expected that everyone on
the Quad will be reached. Stations
will be maintained on the campus to
catch the late contributor, although the
Service Board hopes to have the sub
scriptions practically completed when as
many houses as possible turn in a 100
per cent membership before Tuesday
noon. However, the Red Cross badge
will be the only protection against at
tack by persistent canvassers, and it is
reported that students may even find it
preferable to join twice rather than ap
pear badgeless upon the button-dotted
Quad.
In order that the University may
reach the $2,000 mark, which has l>een
set as the quota, every house on the
campus must have in its window the
large cross, which indicates that it has
answered this Red Cross call to its full
capacity.
Consequently, no house will be con
sidered "on the map" if it fails to show
in its window its symbol of complete
membership. And as for the students
and professorsâ€”public opinion rumors
that although they cut no classes, no one
will know why they are there unless
they have a Red Cross to prove it. Wear
your button!
