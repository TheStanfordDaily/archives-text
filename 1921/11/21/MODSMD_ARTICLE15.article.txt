# CARDINAL AND BEAR WATER POLO TEAMS TO CLASH TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo seven will play
the University of California team to
night in the Olympic Club tank in the
final game of the 1921 national junior
water polo championship. If the Card
inal aggregation disposes of the Blue
and Gold mermen, it will be a runner-up
to the Olympic juniors, who will still
retain their title.
On the basis of past performances,
the Stanford waterdogs will have
the best of the argument. Both teams
defeated tlie Neptune Club last week.
The Olympics submerged the Califor
nians with a 12-0 count, but it took the
breaks of the game to enable the cham
pion clubmen to win from Stanford, 4-1.
Brandsten will play his regular seven
tonight. Strauss, Miller and Drake will
start at the forward positions; Captain
Stern. Austin, Fletcher are to form the
Cardinal defense, and Greppin will guard
the goal.
Intcrclass water polo is getting under
way tliis afternoon with the experienced
senior team meeting the freshmen.
Drake, H. Austin, Lacey, Stern and
Strauss, for the fourth-year men, have
all had varsity experience, and they
should form a combination hard to beat.
The strength of ..the freshmen seven is
unknown, as they have not appeared in
competition before.
Tomorrow afternoon the sophomores
and juniors will line up in the second
game.
