# The
						Team and the Coaches.

### 
Nothing but praise is clue the men of the Stanford
varsity football team and the coaches for the showing
made on Saturday afternoon. Every one believed
that the men would fight in the face of the over
whelming odds against them, but no one thought
that men could fight so hard. They fought from
whistle to gun, playing the game they had been taught
to play in a manner befitting Stanford men. They
were heart and soul in the game. Many of them
broke down completely and wept when they were
forced to leave the game to make way for fresh
men, so strong was their desire to give all that they
had for Stanford.
Although they were defeated it was at the hands
of a better team. The team showed the evidences
of some heady coaching. There were several things
that came out of the Big Game that showed that the
Cardinal eleven had been well coached. The way
the players broke up the Bruins' passing offensive,
the interference they provided for the man receiving
punts, the manner in which they followed the ball
and took advantage of their opponents' misplays, the
way they sifted through the California interference
to get at the safety, all indicated that Coach Gene Van
Gent and his sasistant coaches, Joe Fitzgerald, J. B.
Canning, and "Dink" Templeton, not only know
American football but that they know how to teach it.
The playing of the Cardinal Varsity in the Big
Game was a promise. It forecasted a greater Stan
ford eleven next seasonâ€”a winning eleven in the
very near future.
The eleven fought hard and fought well, and Stan
ford is proud of every man who aided in building
it. Not only did they play the game, but they proved
the Stanford claim to l>e classed among the leaders
in intercollegiate football ranks by scoring the first
touchdown in the new Stanford bowl.
