# Correcting a False Impression.

Stanford's $210,000 athletic stadium was dedi
cated on Saturday afternoon by two fighting foot
ball elevens before approximately sixty thousand
people. Everyone who attended praised the enter
prise that prompted the speedy erection of such a
magnificent structure. There was but one unfortu
nate circumstance to mar the perfect consummation
â€¢of the project. Five thousand people were denied
.the privilege of attending the dedication.
Kvery one connected with the Stanford end of the
Rig Game arrangements believed that every available
seat would be disposed of. On the last day it was
discovered that the University of California had not
disposed of a block of five thousand seats. Meas
ures were taken at the last minute to place these seats
and efforts were *iade through the channels of pub
licity to acquaint the public with the news that these
seats were available. But it, was too late.
Several explanations have been advanced for the
reason for this last day return of such a large block
of tickets. One is that it was done to boost the
California stadium campaign; another that the dis
tribution office at Berkeley was unable to handle the
enormous demand for tickets and was swamped.
Whatever the explanation no modicum of blame
can be attached to the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control or the Graduate Manager's Office. They
had been told that every seat would be disposed of.
The news that this large block of tickets was avail
able Saturday morning was as great a shock to them
as the sight of two empty sections was to the sixty
thousand in attendance at the game.
Stanford denies any responsibility for this unfor
tunate circumstance and any connivance with the
University of California, as well as knowledge of
any plan to aid the California Stadium campaign.
