# Praise From the Visitors.

Stanford enjoyed a glorious day Saturday de
spite the fact that the Cardinal Varsity was bested in
the football game with the University of California.
There were several phases of the day's j H)gram and
several things not listed on the program that are
worthy of remark.
Stanford welcomed almost sixty thousand visitors
on Saturday and showed them true hospitality. Be
cause Stanford is a small institution it is possible to
extend cordial welcome to a great mass of people,
whereas an institution that has grown so large that
there is very little connection between its component
parts would have been at a loss in receiving such a
crowd.
Many comments were heard at the close of the
day about the wonderful treatment accorded the
visiting thousands. Every living group received and
dined many people. Aftreward they showed them
the points of interest around the campus. Other
visitors were given aid in the matter of information
and told courteously the things they wanted to know.
That they were gratified at the hospitality shown to
them was evidenced by the profuse praise that was
heard when the day was over. Aside from the Big
Game and the wonderful stadium they could talk
only of the hospitable attention they received here.
