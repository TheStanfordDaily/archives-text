Now that the Big Game is over, we cannot help giv
ing our opinions on some of the sport writers in the
city papers. Cabbages can write sports, but not like
some of the Big Town ink-slingers. A deep-sea fisher
man ought to make his fortune in the game—he's used
to handling a heavy line.

But who said Kabbages kan't handle sports? Glance
over the following, our special reports from the field of
battle:

By James Jack (Kabbages Korrespondent)
The wind was moaning over the hilltops. Eleven sea
gulls winged their way in flight thru the pepper trees,
The pilot grasped the rudder with one hand, his
mustache with the other, and did a back-flip.

GREETINGS.
"HI, HURDLE!"
"LO BROW!"

Sixty thousand clams went wild with joy. The sun
set. Final score, 678 to 677. Thus was the first foot
ball game on the new enclosure lost to the defeated
team. Hot Dog!

By Minnie Laurie (Also a K. K.)
The little lady next to me in the gray dress sobbed
with convulsive joy as they carried him off the field.
"My boy! my boy!" I heard her mutter under her
breath, "he is safe at last!" My woman's mind told me
that she must know this lad, and I realized that I was
the spectator of one of the most poignant of all the
poignant Bcenes of the marvellous contest of strength
and kill that was taking place under my very eyes. Ah!
Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!

By Horace Gumshoe (K. K.)
The stands, packed with a jam of sardine-like hu
manity, rocked under the reverberating cheers of the
yell-leaders as they strode back and forth in their white
pants. Far up above pennants and neckties, handker
chiefs and hands fluttered in the breezes, while the
drone of hundreds of airplanes circling above the stadi
um like flies above a dish of jello, drowned out the
peaceful slumbers of the cops. It was a riot of color,
but no one was hurt. Altopether boys, it was a wow!

By Tobasco Ibanez (Special K. K.)
Who is it has the ball? Ah, it is the mighty Jones!
See how he swerves—sidesteps—halfhitches—slides—
crawls —burrows —until the ball rests a scant 50 yards
from the goal.
But what is this? He is called back on a penalty—
the referee has just discovered he spoke rudely to his
grandmother a week ago. The bleachers —both of them
—go wild. But 100k —100k —what is that man with the
gun going to do? Is it loaded? He raises it in the air
with both hands, and fires. But his aim is poor. They
all run off the field unhurt. Maybe he didn't want to
hit them. Nevertheless, the day is saved —part of it, at
least —it's only 5 o'clock.

Editorial
We as students, and otherwise, don't take enough
interest in affairs outside our own limited sphere of
interest. Why don't we? (Best answer to this question
will receive a mean look). Therefore, Cabbages are
sure that if we can get some good hot dehates stirred
up over questions of national importance, the student
body will be benefited as well as enlightened. Follow
ing are a few suggestions:

People have complained that the Cabbage Column has
been growing shorter lately. Notice the word—"com
plained."—We are flattered, gents. But it's not Cab
bages that's been shortening—the editorials seem to
lap over on our space every once in a while, sometimes
often er.
