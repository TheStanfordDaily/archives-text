# STATE DOCUMENTS FEATURE HOOVER'S WAR COLLECTIONS

### 
Foreign greenbacks, war propaganda
and proclamations—all a part of the
Hoover War Collection—have just been
placed in cases on the left and right
sides of the balcony at the top of the
stairs in the library.
In one of the cases on the left may
be seen two large German proclama
tions, one of which is written in French
and the other in German. These state
ments, which were issued in Belgium in
1917, are the gift of Grace Davis
Booth, '95.
The other case is filled with paper
money, of all sizes and colors, which
has been collected from all over the
world. Samples of Georgian money
(Caucassus) have been donated by the
Bureau of Engraving in Georgia.
The South American roubles and Baku
roubles displayed are the gift of Ruth
Veuve N. E. R. Tiflis. Some of the
money used by Generals Denikine and
Wrangle of Bolshevist Russia are shown
as are also greenbacks from the Aus
trian and German Baltic provinces.
In the upper of the two cases placed
on the right hand side of the library
balcony arc a telegram of Ludendorff's
(Wolff), two German translations of
the wireless propaganda reports sent
out by the French station at Lyons,
and a French mobilization order, which
is from the collection of an officer of
the German general staff.
Below these, copies of Italian, Ger
man and British propaganda are dis
played. In a queerly covered pamphlet
entitled "The Barbarism of Berlin,"
Italian ideas are expressed. A copy of
British propaganda printed in German
and distributed in various ways to Ger
man soldiers and civilians, and a poster
stating a reward for the arrest of spies,
and phamplets issued in Spain by both
the British and German governments,
complete this vividly colored portion of
the Hoover War Collection.
