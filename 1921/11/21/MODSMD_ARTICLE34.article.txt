# STANFORD. CALIFORNIA TIE IN SOCCER, 0-0
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity* soccer team is -till
unbeaten.
The old saying that all the breaks go
to the better team did not prove to be
true when the California soccer team
tied the Cardinals 0-0, on the local field
Saturday morning.
Stanford's eleven outplayed their op
ponents in every department of the
game, and it is only because the team
was on the wrong end of the breaks
that the Cards did not win the contest.
It proved to be the hardest fought game
that the Cardinal eleven has had this
season, and although they tried desper
ately they could not overcome the
Bruins' lucky horse-shoe.
For the most part, especially in the
second half, the ball was in California's
territory, and throughout the game it
was very seldom that the Bruins in
vaded the vicinity of Stanford's goal.
The varsity was always on the offensive,
and although they did not score against
the Berkeley team, the eleven played in
its best form. The teamwork was the
best displayed this season, and even
though the Cardinal scoring machine
could not break the ice, they were al
ways working together and were con
stantly bombarding the enemy goal.
To pick out the stars of the Stanford
team would be an impossibility. The
team played more as a unit than in any
game so far. Every man was in his
place when needed, and the ball was
constantly rushed. Captain Bill Gor
man, playing right half, was always
backing the forwards and breaking up
the enemy's offensive. Peavy, the Card
inal inside right, was a mafked man
from the very start of the game. He
played a consistent game, and many of
his shots caused great worry on the
part of the California backfield. Dwight
and Swain also played good games for
the varsity. California's mainstays were
Captain Weldon and Ankersmit.
