# BOARD OF CONTROL NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR UNSOLD SEATS
## 
### 
Stanford is not responsible in any way
for the vacant seats in the stadium on
Saturday. This is the announcement
made by the Board of Athletic Control,
through Dr. Thomas M. Williams, '97,
president. On Saturday morning ap
proximately 5,500 tickets were returned
to Athletic Board officials, which had
been withheld by the California interests
to be sold only to subscribers toward
California's stadium. The statement
is issued, it is added, not as a peevish
kick about the game, with which every
one was satisfied, but in an effort to set
the Board right with the public, which
would otherwise hold the Stanford offi
cials cither accountable for the seats, or
at least in collusion with the University
of California in attempt to force the
sale of the stadium subscriptions.
Dr. Williams' statement is:
"The fact that there were several
thousand unoccupied seats was as great
a surprise to us as to the public, and in
the interests of fair dealing wc make
this statement.
"We feel that an explanation is due to
the hundreds of people who attempted
to purchase tickets for the California-
Stanford game and were told that they
were not available.
"The tickets for the game had been
apportioned between California and
Stanford in accordance with an agree
ment that seats noUsold in advance to
students, alumni, and stadium subscrib
ers should be placed on sale to the gen
eral public well in advance of the game.
Stanford sold all its allotment of tickets
on this basis, and had every reason to
believe that the stadium would be filled
to capacity. Saturday morning we were
astonished to receive from California
5,500 unsold tickets, which had been
withheld without our knowledge or con
sent.
"During the past week wc made every
effort, in the light of such information
as had been given us, to give the public
opportunity to secure every remaining
seat.
"We disclaim all responsibility for any
published statements giving the impres
sion that the public could not obtain
seats."
