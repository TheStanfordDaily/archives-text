# SALESMANSHIP TOPIC OF MacMAHON'S SPEECH
## 
### 
"A sale always takes place in the head
before it takes place in the pocketbook."
Such was the statement made by A. G.
MacMalum, manager of the National
Cash Register Company of San Fran
cisco, in his lecture Thursday after
noon on "The Psychology of Salesman
ship." MacMahon holds the world's
record challenge cup for salesmanship,
and is also a criminologist.
MacMahon pointed out that the pros
pective buyer is always negative when
approached by the salesman who is posi
tive and constructive. The problem of
the salesman is to change the mind of a
prospective purchaser.
"No human being can think of two
things at once, one is subordinated. The
idea is either accepted or rejected at
once," MacMahon continued. "Telling
the truth about your product and mak
ing it so attractive that someone else
wants it immediately, is salesmanship.
"When you get mad, you show that
you are getting the worst of an argu
ment. Don't lose your temper, and al
ways leave the way open so that you
can come back. Above all things, leave
your prospects smiling. A smile is the
most potent factor in the world," con
cluded MacMahon.
