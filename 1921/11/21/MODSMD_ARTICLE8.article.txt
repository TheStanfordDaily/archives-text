# STANFORD TO PLAY BLUE AND GOLD IN HANDBALL TOURNEY
## 
### 
Stanford and California will hook
up in their annual clash on the hand
ball courts on December 3d. Doubles,
as well as singles representatives, are
to be entered in the torney, which is
to be played on the box courts of the
Berkeley Y. M. C. A.
Last year California was forced to
forfeit all but one of the scheduled
matches to Stanford because of lack
of placers. A. Lowensteiu was the on
ly Cardinal man to compete, and he
won his match handily.
This year Stanford has plenty oi
material, and Trom the class of hand
ball displayed in the recent tourna
ment, most of the players have plenty
of skill and experience at the court
game. Rutter and Reticke.r, winners
of the doubles tournament, are almost
certain to wear the Cardinal colors
in both the singles and doubles. San
sone and Cohen are a pair that is sec
ond only to Rutter and Reticker, al
though they have not been playing
together so long.
