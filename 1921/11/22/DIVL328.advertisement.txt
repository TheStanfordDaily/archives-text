THE STATUE OF LIBERTY
Most of the famous structures of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators.
WHAT structure is better known or is
more typical of America than this
Statue at the gate of New York.
Countless thousands from the old world pass
under the uplifted arm that holds a light
which means to them worlds more than to
us, though our millions know it and love
• it for the symbol it is.
It is fitting that an Otis Elevator should
carry passengers up through the base to the
foot of the Statue. For though the activities
of Otis are world-wide, the beginnings, the
creation, the basic ideas and the great de
velopments of vertical transportation were
made by Otis in America.
