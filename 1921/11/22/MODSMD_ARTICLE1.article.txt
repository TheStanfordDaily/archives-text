### 
An official letter from F. W. Tenney,
president of the Associated Students of
the University of California, was re
ceived this morning by President Dan W.
Evans, disclaiming all knowledge of the
perpetrators of the attempted bombing
raid on the Stanford bonfire last Thurs
day, when aeroplanes carrying bombs
nearly succeeded in setting the great fire
off before the rally in the evening. Ten
jiey is working on the theory that some
unknown members of the freshman class
at California were responsible for the
attempt, and he is making all possible
efforts to find the names of the culprits
and bring them to justice before the stu»
dent court of the University of Califor
nia. <v£gj
The letter expresses the regret of any
happening that, might go to mar the ex
cellent feeling that has existed between
the Universities, and assures the Stan
ford students that every means will be
taken to make certain that such an act
does not occur again.
The letter follows:
Berkeley, Cal.,
November 21, 1921.
Mr. Daniel W. Evans,
President Associated Students,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Mr. Evans:
Following a conversation with
Lloyd Aubert on Saturday, I re
turned to Berkeley and have been
engaged in a preliminary investiga
tion of the attempt to bomb the
Stanford bonfire. The only result
of the investigation has been that we
have heard rumors that the perpe
trators of this deed were certain un
known members of the freshman
class. We are endeavoring to learn
their identity but up to the present
time we have been unsuccessful.
We regret this happening deeply
and hope that the Stanford students
will understand that it was entirely
unofficial and was the act of thought
less and irresponsible first-year stu
dents, who had had little opportunity
to learn the true feeling which ex
ists between the two Universities.
It is our earnest desire that the
agreement now existing between Cali
fornia and Stanford shall be strictly
adhered to in the future, and we shall
endeavor to give adequate publicity
to it before our Intercollegiate con
tests.
Very sincerely,
F. W. Tenney,
President Associated Students,
University of California.
