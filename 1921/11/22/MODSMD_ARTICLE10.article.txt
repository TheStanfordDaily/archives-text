# FRESHMEN URGED TO AID CAMPUS ACTIVITIES
## Roth, Powell, Seib, Binkley, Carskadon, and Sparling Talk at Frosh Assembly 
### 
At the Freshman assembly held last
evening in the Assembly Hall, men and
women of the class of '25 were told of
the opportunities that are before them
in the various activities of the Univer
sity. Dramatics, journalism, athletics,
debating, were shown to be portals
through which the aspiring student
might pass into the larger and most vital
affairs of Stanford, gaining much
through the fellowship and the expe
riences that they offer.
, Representing the journalists of Stan
ford, Tom Carskadon; '22, who is editor
of Chaparral, just sketched the field that
exists at Stanford for the writer. For
those who can do work of a high liter
ary caliber, there is the Stanford Card
inal, published by the English Club. Or
if there is someone who has an idea for
the conduct of student affairs, or an
opinion to express, the Stanford Pic
torial is ready to receive them. The
Daily Palo Alto was praised by Carska
don, who urged those who were in
terested in journalism to try out for its
staff. As editor of Chaparral, he in
vited those who were handy at rhyme
or drawing to submit contributions of
a smile-producing nature. The honors
awaiting the successful journalist in the
Press Club, in Hammer and Coffin So
ciety, and in Sigma Delta Chi were held
up as well worth while.
Debating was discussed by Robert
Binkley, '20. who has achieved much
prominence himself in forensic art. The
California debate, the Washington and
Oregon debates, and the Joffre Medal
debate, as well as interclass debating,
and membership in the Stanford debat
ing societies, Nestoria and Euphronia,
are open to freshmen contestants.
Walter Powell made an appeal for
participation in athletics, particularly in
basketball, which will start immediately
after the Thanksgiving vacation. Speak
ing of the football season, he said, "We
are not defeated in our hearts; no, not
one of us," and throughout his talk, he
emphasized this phase of Stanford spirit.
Of Coach Gene Van Gent, who will
handle the coaching of basketball.
Powell stated. "He was the star center
of the Western Conference for three
years. He knows the game from the
ground up, and he will be able to turn
out real Stanford teams."
As the foremost campus dramatist,
Les Seib, '22. explained the opportuni
ties for freshmen in the production of
the five plays that will be given before
the close of the college year, asking all
who could be of any use in dramatics,
as actors, stage hands, stage carpenters
and electricians and the like, to leave
their names with Gordon Davis, the fac
ulty coach. Freshmen women are in
eligible for dramatics, he explained.
Jim Sparling, '20, told the Y. M. C. A.
and the part that it hoped to play on the
campus as an aid to character building.
"Some students may think we can do
without the Y. M. C. A. here,," he said,
"but they cannot say that we can do
without the things for which it stands."
As a fitting conclusion to the assem
bly, the last of the series which the
Y. M. C. A., the Associated Students,
and the Y. W. C. A. have jointly been
presenting, A. E. Roth, comptroller of
the University, spoke concerning activi
ties in general.
"Participation in student activities,"
he explained, "brings out a man's quali
ties of leadership, and it develops his
capacity for friendship, great assets for
later life. A person taking part in an
activity, such as athletics, must not be
come bigoted, believing that all who are
out for other things are negligible fac
tors in the life of the college," he warned
the students.
"Above all, remember Stanford men
are square-shooters."

California debate, the Washington and

are open to freshmen contestants.
Walter Powell made an appeal for
participation in athletics, particularly in
basketball, which will start immediately
after the Thanksgiving vacation. Speak
ing of the football season, he said, "We
are not defeated in our hearts; no, not
one of us," and throughout his talk, he
emphasized this phase of Stanford spirit.
Of Coach Gene Van Gent, who will
handle the coaching of basketball.
Powell stated. "He was the star center
of the Western Conference for three
years. He knows the game from the
ground up, and he will be able to turn
out real Stanford teams."
As the foremost campus dramatist,
Les Seib, '22. explained the opportuni
ties for freshmen in the production of
the five plays that will be given before
the close of the college year, asking all
who could be of any use in dramatics,
as actors, stage hands, stage carpenters
and electricians and the like, to leave
their names with Gordon Davis, the fac
ulty coach. Freshmen women are in
eligible for dramatics, he explained.
Jim Sparling, '20, told the Y. M. C. A.
and the part that it hoped to play on the
campus as an aid to character building.
"Some students may think we can do
without the Y. M. C. A. here,," he said,
"but they cannot say that we can do
without the things for which it stands."
As a fitting conclusion to the assem
bly, the last of the series which the
Y. M. C. A., the Associated Students,
and the Y. W. C. A. have jointly been
presenting, A. E. Roth, comptroller of
the University, spoke concerning activi
ties in general.
"Participation in student activities,"
he explained, "brings out a man's quali
ties of leadership, and it develops his
capacity for friendship, great assets for
later life. A person taking part in an
activity, such as athletics, must not be
come bigoted, believing that all who are
out for other things are negligible fac
tors in the life of the college," he warned
the students.
"Above all, remember Stanford men
are square-shooters."
At the Freshman assembly held last
evening in the Assembly Hall, men and
women of the class of '25 were told of
the opportunities that are before them
in the various activities of the Univer
sity. Dramatics, journalism, athletics,
debating, were shown to be portals
through which the aspiring student
might pass into the larger and most vital
affairs of Stanford, gaining much
through the fellowship and the expe
riences that they offer.
, Representing the journalists of Stan
ford, Tom Carskadon; '22, who is editor
of Chaparral, just sketched the field that
exists at Stanford for the writer. For
those who can do work of a high liter
ary caliber, there is the Stanford Card
inal, published by the English Club. Or
if there is someone who has an idea for
the conduct of student affairs, or an
opinion to express, the Stanford Pic
torial is ready to receive them. The
Daily Palo Alto was praised by Carska
don, who urged those who were in
terested in journalism to try out for its
staff. As editor of Chaparral, he in
vited those who were handy at rhyme
or drawing to submit contributions of
a smile-producing nature. The honors
awaiting the successful journalist in the
Press Club, in Hammer and Coffin So
ciety, and in Sigma Delta Chi were held
up as well worth while.
