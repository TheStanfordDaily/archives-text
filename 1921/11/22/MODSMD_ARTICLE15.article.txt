# BRUINS WEAKER, CARDS STRONGER 1922 FORECAST
## Every Player Who Started in Line Saturday for Varsity Will Be Back Next Season 
### 
That graduation and ineligibility
will affect California's football varsity
next year more than Stanford's was
the belief expressed on the campus
by an official in the athletic depart
ment.
At the same time it is thought that
material from this year's Stanford
freshmen will excel that which the
Bruin varsity will get from its first
year team.
The entire line, from end to end,
which started for the Cards Saturday
will be back next year. On the other
hand Andy Smith will lose the major
portion of his great line, considered
the real strength of the "wonder
team."
"Scotchy" Campbell and "Shorty"
Mertz, Stanford ends who opened
against the Bears will be back next
year. Campbell is now a sophomore
and Mertz a junior. Sproull is an
other varsity end who will return.
Both Harley Carter and Fred Lu
deke, the tackles, are eligible for two
more years and Joe Douglass and
Dick Faville, guards, will also be back
cn the squad.
"Dud" DeGroot, center, whom the ex
perts say showed up Captain Latham,
Saturday, has another year of varsity
football.
It is in the backfield that the Cardi
nals will suffer their greatest loss, for
Captain Patrick, Bob Shlaudeman and
Art Wilcox will be lost to the team
next year. Rae Doughty is the only
survivor of the backs that started
against the Bears.
From the substitutes, Cliff Hey,
"Bud" Woodward, Glenn Hartranft
and others will be back for next year's
varsity squad. "Red" Betts, one of
Saturday's stars, graduates at the end
of this quarter. Pershing will also
graduate.
With such men as Cuddeback, Gille
land, Dennis, Howard, Shipkey, Dole
and Jannsen from this year's fresh
man squad. Stanford should get more
good material than the Bruins. Spald
ing was the only California first-year
man who showed varsity class during
the season.
California will lose Captain George
Latham, Lee Cranmer, McMillan,
Barnes, Stephens and Englebretson
from the line and "Crip" Toomey from
the backfield.
In the Bruin backfield with Spalding
coming up and Jack Witter recovered
from the injuries which it is said kept
him from displacing both Nisbet and
Morrison at full this year, Smith
should have a better set of backs than
he has this season. But how about
the line? The best backs in the world
can't make yards if they haven't a line
that will hold.
