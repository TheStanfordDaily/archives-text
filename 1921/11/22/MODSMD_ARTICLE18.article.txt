# The
						College Grasshopper.
## 
### 
When the grasshopper who had played all sum
mer came around to ant headquarters at Ant Hill
for a free lunch, he was informed that there was
only enough to feed the laborers. At least Aesop
told us so; and he's one writer of the old days who
spoke more truth than poetry.
However, to get down to the present, many stu
dents have been playing grasshopper ever since
Registration Day and are already preparing a tale
of woe to tell the scholarship committee. Some are
arranging for leaves of absence in order to make
the playing summer an all-year-around affair. Those
of us who depend on that support will find the
college climate unchangeable. When the time comes
for it to get cold, the grasshoppers will be frosted
out.
We come with firm intentions of diving into a
whirlpool of academic activity. We dive —and sink
to the bottom into the force that makes the academic
pool whirl—student activities. We occasionally
come up for air, the oftener the better, for those
who don't get it. Too many ex-students have al
ready learned that although student activities are
among the greatest things in university life, they are
at the same time the most dangerous. Athletic con
tests on Saturday, trips to the city over Sunday, and
a meeting of a club on Monday evening eat up three
days' time. Rehearsal, gymnasium and turf take up
afternoons and evenings. Initiations, meetings, dates
and off-campus trips take time. The busy student
puts off study until the week-end. The week-end
arrives and he starts the cycle again.
Last week the Big Game took attention from
academic affairs. Everyone determined to do his
work this week. Today, everyone who put off
studying till this week plans to catch up over the
holidays.
The ants are filling their storehouses against a
cold day at the end of the quarter. The grass
hoppers are still playing. Next month they will
migrate to the offices of the scholarship committee,
the Registrar, the Dean of Men and the Dean of
Women, if not to the President, himself. They will
hear about the Big Frost and most of them will ex
perience it. Aesop will turn over in his sepulchrt
and tell his fable all over again.
Those of us who are grasshoppers have still an
opportunity to learn the ways of the ant family.
