# Do You Wear a Red Cross Button?
## 
### 
One of the greatest institutions of modern times
is the Red Cross. Originating in an effort to miti
gate the suffering during the Crimean War, seventy
years ago, it has developed into a great humani
tarian agency which serves the world in peace as well
as in times of conflict. In all English-speaking por
tions of the globe, the name "Red Cross" is well
known, and in the other parts of the world it has its
counterpart in organizations which are designed and
operated upon the same lines, though differing in
name. There is the Moslem Society of the Crescent;
there is La Cruz Roja of Mexico and other Spanish
speaking countries. All are bound together with
the tie of good-will. All constitute a great brother
hood, in which we each may have a part.
When a dollar is given for a membership in the
American Red Cross, that membership links up the
individual with this great world-wide force.
We know what the American Red Cross has ac
complished, in time of war and in time of peace.
Some of us can remember with distinctness the great
work it did for us at the time of the San Francisco
earthquake and fire. We know what it is doing for
the ex-soldier, his family, and all those dependent
upon him. We know that if there were to l>e a great
catastrophe here at Stanford, causing human suffer
ing, the Red Cross would be among the first agencies
to come to our relief.
Those who have made their contribution to the
Red Cross and have accepted a membership button
for the coming year realize this. Some have not

given the matter of Red Cross membership serious
thought. Do not let indifference prevent you from
doing your part in the present roll call campaign.
Give your mite, take your button. By so doing, you
join with thousands who stand behind Red Cross
aims and ideals throughout the world, and advance
the good work of our American organization.
