What ho! Three burly pages from Mac Henry. Some
body must have been feeding him yeast. That's the
most steam this railroad ever saw. He bows.

We were all pepped up last night by seeing this in
the paper: "Are you cold during the night?" It was
an advertisement for blankets. Well?

As the dog-catcher said to the dash hound, "You may
be in bad now, but you'll be in wurst later."

Some guys don't know when to quit. Not being satis
fied by having the "C" painted red, they tried to give
the Stanford campus the same tinge.

SELAH!
I'm broken hearted, sad, and sore perplexed,
Oh, Allah, art thou with me vexed?
I knew not what I did, ere it was done.
It seemed to me that it was rather fun.
Yet I have been a traitor to the cause.
Why stayed ye not my hand, nor gave me pause?
Thou knowest that i'd keep our statute rule
If I but knew it. I was a fool,
And e'en my idle tongue did play me false.
My teeth, my lips, my eyebrows. . . al6o false.
There yet remains one course for me to take.
I hie me, gracious Allah, to the lake.
A fitting end for me; a death of pain,
For one whose eyes are so transfixed with gain,
That he should thus thy teachings so infame,
And lay a wager on a football game.
Selah. The lake.
• * *
Old Mother Goose Up-to-Date
Sing a song of six-pence, country very dry.
Four and twenty bootlegs, cooking moonshine pie,
When the pie was opened, they sold the Searsville
slough,
Now isn't that a dirty trick for honest men to do?
• * *
Little Jack Horner, sat in the corner,
Figuring out the "DOPE,"
But his brow was soon creased, and he suddenly
ceased,
And said: "What a dumbell to mope."
MAC HENRY.
• * •
Selah! He coudn't have been that bird who is going
around now with blue glasses since watching the de
parture of the Cal. women from their bandstand. That
must have been worth almost any loss.
• • •
And then:
The War is Over
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."
Quoth the cynic, "What a jest."
Though I harshly laugh, I ponder
Why before I never guessed.
None but fools expect exceptions
Blind to writing on the wall.
Why the lingering self-deception
That which rises—sure to fall?
Too much passion do I squander?
It must end with all the rest.
"Absence makes the heart grow fonder."
Quoth the Cynic, "What a jest."
PEER US.
* * »
That's something like the standard Tuesday will try
to bear. The market for good verse never closes.

It is just as the Friendly Waiter said mheu it was
suggested that the performance was very finished. It
is the last word.

KABBAGES FORENSIC TOPICS
Everybody else
gets away
with this kind
of stuff, so
we thought we
might as well
do it, too.
This kind of
free verse
reminds us
of the chocolate eclair
you get at the Union
if you're not careful.
It looks good
from the outside,
but when you really inspect it,
oh, Aunt Maria!
It ain't so much
after all.
Anyway,
it's good space filler,
as the small boy
remarked
of the Thanksgiving turkey.
• * •
Cabbages is now secure in its position as one of the
leading lights of the campus, having rated a real, spe
cific razz. (See last issue of Chaparral). Now, if the
Pictoriul and the 111 Review will come across with a
few remarks, we feel that our position will be supreme.
As Nero said, when interviewed by our special cor
respondent after the fire, "Why did I fiddle while Rome
was smoking? To rate a razz in Cabbages, of course!"
* * *
Results of the First Rainy Day.
Barometer—depressed. Feelings—low. Day—gray.
Windage—mostly from right lung.
"What now, Jack. Why the rain-coat?"
"I'm wise. It's to keep away the rain."
♦ * *
WELL, MATCHES—LET'S STRIKE!

There yet remains one course for me to take.

For one whose eyes are so transfixed with gain,

And lay a wager on a football game.
