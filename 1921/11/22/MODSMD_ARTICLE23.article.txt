# COMMITTEE AT U. C. WiLL LOOK INTO LIVING CONDITIONS
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 22. â€”Owing to the
high cost of room and board at pri
vate rooming houses here, a commit
tee has been appointed to examine the
living condition of the University stu
dents. It will act in conjunction with
the dormitory committee, which is
formulating plans for the erection of
several dormitories. At present there
are no dormitories at the University
of California, so non-organization stu
dents are forced to pay exorbitant
prices, in many cases, for rooms and
board.
