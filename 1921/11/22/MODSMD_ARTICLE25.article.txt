UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, Nov. 22 â€”
Utah's first annual homecoming proved
to be a huge success. Many former
students visited the campus and en
tered into the festivities. They were
entertained on the campus in the
morning, attended the Utah-Boulder
football classic and were received at
fraternity and sorority houses in the
afternoon and were tendered a ball at
the Hotel Utah in the evening.
