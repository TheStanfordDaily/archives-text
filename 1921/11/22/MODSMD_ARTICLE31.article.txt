# LIBRARY RECEIVES ADDITIONS TO WAR COLLECTION LISTS
## 
### 
Foreign greenbacks, war propaganda
and proclamations, all a part of the
Hoover War Collection, have just been
placed in cases on the left and right
sides of the balcony at the top of the
stairs in the Stanford Library.
In one of the cases on the left may
be seen two large German proclama
tions, one of which is written in
French and the other in German. These
statements, which were issued in Bel
gium in 1917, are the gifts of Grace
uavis Booth, '95.
The other case is filled with paper
money, of all sizes and colors, which,
has been collected from every part of
the world. Samples of Georgian
(Caucassus) have been donated by the
Bureau of Engraving in Georgia.
The South American roubles and
Baku roubles displayed are the gift
of Ruth Veuve, N. E. R., Tiflis. Some
of the money used by General Deni
kine and General Wrangel of Bolshe
vist Russia, are shown as well as
greenbacks from the Austrian and the
German Baltic provinces.
In the upper of the two cases placed
on the right-hand side of the library
balcony are a telegram of Ludendorf's
(Wolff), two German translations of
the wireless propaganda reports sent
cut by the French station at Lyons,
and a French mobilization order,
which is from the collection of an of
ficer of the German General staff.
Below these, copies of Italian, Ger
man and British propaganda, are dis
played. In a queerly covered pamph
let, entitled, "The Barbarism of Ber
lin," Italian ideas are expressed. A
copy of British propaganda printed in
German and distributed, in various
ways to German soldiers and civilians,
a poster stating a reward for the ar
rest of spies, and pamphlets issued in
Spain by both the British and Ger
man governments, complete the dis
play.
