# BRAZILIAN DOCUMENTS ARE GIVEN TO LIBRARY
## 
### 
The Stanford Library has recently re
ceived a very valuable collection of
documents from Brazil, as a gift from
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of that
country. The documents consist for the
most part of annual reports of the Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, and correspond
to the annual reports of our national
state department. The reports cover the
most important years of the Brazillian
empire, and of the republic.
The collection contains material on
these subjects not found in the reports
of our own state department. No li
brary in the United States now contains
as complete a collection of documents
on Brazillian foreign relations as the
Stanford Library. It was party through
the efforts of Professor Percy Martin,
of the history department, that the gift
was secured.
