# Trees of Art Gallary Grove Will Be Removed To Allow Freer Growth
## 
### 
Trees in the grove by the art gallery
are now being boxed preparatory to
being set out in more advantageous parts
of the campus, notably about the basket
ball pavilion. Fine specimens of conifers
are included in the trees to be removed,
which liave been stunted by too close
planting. When this work is completed,
it will also open up new vistas in the
arcades of the art gallery, which was
hitherto obscured. The trees will not be
removed from the soil until spring.
The process of removing trees by box
ing involves sinking a six foot box four
feet in to the ground about the side
roots of the tree, the bottom roots re
maining uncut. After six months, when
the side roots have again established
themselves inside the enclosure, the bot
tom roots are cut and the tree removed.
All the Salvia plants, the annuals about
the parapot in front of the Administra
tion building which were damaged by
the frost, have been removed. It is
planned eventually to liave permanent
planting in these beds, so that the para
pet will not be bare when the annuals
are removed.
Tentative plans for the landscape gar
dening about the new Union are being
prepared by Gardner Dailey, a student of
the entomology department. The draw
ings are to be submitted to John Mc-
Laren, superintendent of Golden Gate
Park, for approval.
