# RUSHING CONTRACT TO BE REVISED BY LOCAL PANHELLENIC
## 
### 
An entirely new rushing contract is
being drawn up by the local Pan
hellenic for use during the winter
season. Copies will soon be ready for
distribution to the various houses for
ratification. There has been some dis
cussion in favor of a shorter period of
formal rushing, and this question will
be taken up at the next meeting of
Panhellenic on November 28.
A list of the incoming women stu
dents for the winter quarter is now
being compiled. There will be about
fifteen admitted to the university at
that time and their names will be
ready for publication not later than
December 9.
At yesterday's meetings of Panhell
enic, tentative plans for a series of
exchange dinners between the wom
en's houses on the campus was drawn
lip and the date fixed as December 7.
Announcement will be made later as
to how the houses will be grouped for
the exchange.
