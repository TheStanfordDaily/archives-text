# PAVILION AND UNION CONSTRUCTION TO BE COMPLETED BY JAN. 1
## 
### 
Completion of Stanford's building
program will be effected by January 1.
according to present plans. The basket
ball pavilion and the new Union will be
ready for occupancy at that time.
Work on the roof of the Union is
practically finished, and portions of the
arcades have already been tiled. The
final coat of plaster, having the sand
stone tint of the Quad buildings, is
being laid on the towers and facade of
the structure. When completed, it is
ljoped that the other two buildings form
ing the square may be gone over in
the same manner. Rapid progress is
also being made on the interior. The
three dining rooms have been plastered,
and work soon will start on the second
floor. The refrigerating plant is prac
tically installed, and experts are at pres
ent engaged in putting in the scientific
appliances which will be part of the
kitchen. The building is fully wired,
and the plumbing connections have just
been made with the main pipe line.
Construction of the spring floor in the
basketball pavilion and preparation of
the roof for tiling is at present being
rushed by the workmen. Nearly all of
the wooden sleepers have been imbedded
in the concrete base. Upon these, two
by-four beams and joists are to be spiked
to serve as the foundation for the maple
flooring. This floor is on the same plan
as that of the auditorium in the Nurses'
Home in San Francisco, which was in
spected by Coach Van Gent and pro
nounced ideal for basketball purposes.
Wiring, plumbing, and wall work are
practically finished, leaving nothing to
be done but the finishing touches.
When completed the pavilion will ac
commodate 3,000 people, with lockers
and showers for two teams. The cost
will be $90,000, raised by the students
through voluntary assessment, and
through savings made by the president
and comptroller of the University.
The finished Union will have living
quarters for 140 students, and dining
accommodations for 325. The cost will
be $200,000, half of which was donated
anonymously, and the rest raised by the
Board of Trustees. The building is 175
feet long and 85 feet deep.
