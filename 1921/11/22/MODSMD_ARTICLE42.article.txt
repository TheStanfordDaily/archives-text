# VARSITY SWIMMERS TO MEET OLYMPICS IN RETURN MATCH
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity swimming team is
out to turn the tables on the Olympic
Club mermen to atone for the 41 to 27
defeat handed them in San Francisco a
few weeks ago. The Cards and the
Winged "O" swimmers will hook up in
a return meet on December 3d in the
Encina gym pool.
The fact that the local pool will be
the scene of the contest puts an en
tirely different aspect upon the outcome.
The salt water Olympic Club tank
handicapped the Cardinal mermen.
Brandsten looks for Stanford to take
first and second in the plunge for dis
tance, instead of a lone third. This
change in the results would give the
meet to Stanford by a one-point margin.
If Brandsten's charges can score a
win over the Olympic Club, they will
step into the ranks of the strongest
swimming organizations in the country.
The clubmen have such stars on their
roster as Lester Smith, national junior
champion in the 220, and a fast 100-
yard man; Jack Howell, representative
to the Olympic games, in the back stroke,
and George Schroth, one of the leading
sprinters of the Pacific Coast.
These stars arc the ones that will be
hardest pushed by the Stanford swim
mers. The race between Smith and
Austin, the Cardinal skipper, which at
tracted the attention of the swimming
followers in the bay region, will be re
peated, although this time the result
may be different. Austin lost to the
title-holder by two feet in the most ex
citing race of the year.
Clarence Pinkston, '23, champion diver
of the world, will wear the Cardinal
colors against the Olympics. Pinkston,
who won the event at the 1920 Olympic
games, is eligible for all save intercol
legiate competition.
