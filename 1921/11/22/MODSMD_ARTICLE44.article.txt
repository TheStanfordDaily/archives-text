# ORIGINAL FOUNDERS' GRANT IS PLACED IN SAN FRANCISCO VAULT
## 
### 
Comptroller Roth today took the orig- j
inal founding yrant of this University to
the Board of Trustees' meeting in San
Francisco, after which it will he placed
in the vaults there for safe keeping.
It i sa wonderful example of fancy
hand lettering. The artist who pro
duced it is now a recognized authority
on handwriting. He spent nearly a year
in drawing this document, the front
page of which is adorned with a beau
tiful monogram of the University in
red, blue, gold, and black. The entire
work is inscribed on real parchment, a
fact which makes the charatcers, which
are drawn with indelible ink, stand out
as clearly today as they did when the
document was made on November 11,
1885.
Of the twenty-two original members
of the Board of Trustees who signed
this grant only one is now living, Tim
othy Hopkins, who is still z member of
the Board.
