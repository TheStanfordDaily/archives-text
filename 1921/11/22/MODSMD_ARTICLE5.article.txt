# SOPHOMORE PLAY IS VEHICLE FOR CLEVER INDIVIDUAL COMEDY
## 
### 
In "You Never Can Tell," the Ber
nard Shaw comedy, which will be of
fered for campus approval on the even
ing of December 3, the sophomore class
has chosen a play which is not only one
of the best liked comedies to be found,
but also one which affords opportunity
for distinctive and clever work on the
part of the entire cast.
The fact that it is a Shaw comedy is
a guarantee that it contains all the in
gredients necessary. In addition to this,
"You Never Can Tell" has been uni
versally acknowledged as Bernard
Shaw's funniest comedy. The lines are
bright and scintillating. Not a word is
wasted and not an opportunity is missed
for making the most of humorous sit
uations. Action moves swiftly along,
running the gamut of comedy from the
rarest subtlties to quasi-slap-stick va
rieties, but always retaining the touch
of the master comedian.
There are unusual opportunities for
good character work. The play is the
type in which the cast can enter wholly
into the action and each live his char
acterization. There are no stereotyped
figures. Each character is an individual
personality, drawn with clear-cut pre
cision. and it will be interesting to dis
cover how the members of the cast
which has been selected will fit into the
roles assigned them.
Coach Davis has used special care and
deliberation in casting his characters,
which present a unique array. The ac
tion centers around a surprising English
family, the head of which is a yacht
builder who has found it impossible to
live in harmony with his wife, an ad
vanced thinker. Then there are their
children, a boy and girl, who are regu
lar little savages, an elder daughter,
who has survived five romances, only to
enslave a struggling young dentist.
There is also a waiter, William, one of
Shaw's most popular characters, famous
for his dolleries. Each character is
highly individualized land is now iÂ»i
process of development in the rehearsals
which are progressing in the Assembly
Hall this week.
