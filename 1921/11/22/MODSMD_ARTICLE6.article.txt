# BASKETBALL ENTRIES TO CLOSE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Entries in the intramural basketball
leagues will close tomorrow. At present
nearly all the campus organizations have
entered teams, but others may use this
opportunity to sign up at Encina Gym,
today and tomorrow.
It was planned to start the intramural
series this week, but since very few of
the teams have been organized it was
deemed advisable to postpone the sched
ule until after Thanksgiving vacation.
With more than thirty teams entered,
prospects are good for a strong intra
mural season.
The standing of last season's cham
pionship leagues follows:
Organization. Won. Lost. Pet.
Alpha Delta Phi 7 1 .875
Phi Delta Theta 6 2 .750
Delta Upsilon 5 2 .714
Breakers 4 3 .571
Chi Psi 3 4 .428
Medics 3 4 .428
