# CANCELLATION OF DEBTS IS ADVOCATED BY HIRST
## 
### 
"The League of Nations is a sickly tree
planted in the soil of a bad peace, and I
should prefer a lasting peace to its sur
vival," said Francis W. Hirst, speaking
yesterday afternoon in the Little Thea
ter. "The power of ideas is great," he
continued, "and I hope that nations will
see the advantages of cooperation over
conflict and peace over war in effecting
some sort of international relationship."
According to Professor Hirst, it is
a strange paradox that the United
States forced the League of Nations on
Europe and then withdrew. If politics
do not improve there is danger of an
other descent into the Dark Ages such
as followed the fall of the Roman Em
pire when imperialism replaced the
spirit of nationalism.
Concerning the inter-allied debt, Pro
fessor Hirst feels there is a difference
between money lending for war and for
productive purpose. During the war,
France loaned large sums to Russia,
Great Britain to Russia and Belgium,
and the United States to all the allies
through Great Britain, all of which was
used for the destruction of life in Eu
rope. "If the same amounts had been
lent to the United States for destruc
tion of America, would she be able to
repay Europe"? Professor Hirst asked.
Regarding the settlement of inter-al
lied debts, he enumerated eight points:
1. The amounts loaned Great Britain

were not used by that government but
were loaned to other nations.
2. United States entered the war
when it was half through and at first
supplied money because it had no troops
and Europe was exhausted.
3. Proportionate to population the
British debt is triple that of the United
States.
4. All nations are legally bound to
pay their war debts, but the home war
debts have been repudiated in most in
stances by paper currency. We had bet
ter make a virtue out of necessity in
cancelling our debts.
5. Obligations of Russia, Italy aind
France to the United States are greater
than those of Great Britain, who is the
only nation able to pay its debt.
6. British proposals that all' debts be
cancelled are just and normal as every
million loaned was for destruction, mak
ing Europe less able to repay it.
7. If the United States government
does not resist public opinion in can
celling the debts, it must accept payment
in goods since it already lias three
fourths of the world's gold. This will
necessitate a low tariff of free trade.
Referring to Washington's farewell
address, Professor Hirst quoted, "As a
free and enlightened nation, we should
give to mankind an example of a people
always guided by benevolence, and the
reward will repay any temporary loss
or seeming sacrifice."

"The League of Nations is a sickly tree
planted in the soil of a bad peace, and I
should prefer a lasting peace to its sur
vival," said Francis W. Hirst, speaking
yesterday afternoon in the Little Thea
ter. "The power of ideas is great," he
continued, "and I hope that nations will
see the advantages of cooperation over
conflict and peace over war in effecting
some sort of international relationship."
According to Professor Hirst, it is
a strange paradox that the United
States forced the League of Nations on
Europe and then withdrew. If politics
do not improve there is danger of an
other descent into the Dark Ages such
as followed the fall of the Roman Em
pire when imperialism replaced the
spirit of nationalism.
Concerning the inter-allied debt, Pro
fessor Hirst feels there is a difference
between money lending for war and for
productive purpose. During the war,
France loaned large sums to Russia,
Great Britain to Russia and Belgium,
and the United States to all the allies
through Great Britain, all of which was
used for the destruction of life in Eu
rope. "If the same amounts had been
lent to the United States for destruc
tion of America, would she be able to
repay Europe"? Professor Hirst asked.
Regarding the settlement of inter-al
lied debts, he enumerated eight points:
1. The amounts loaned Great Britain

were not used by that government but
were loaned to other nations.
2. United States entered the war
when it was half through and at first
supplied money because it had no troops
and Europe was exhausted.
3. Proportionate to population the
British debt is triple that of the United
States.
4. All nations are legally bound to
pay their war debts, but the home war
debts have been repudiated in most in
stances by paper currency. We had bet
ter make a virtue out of necessity in
cancelling our debts.
5. Obligations of Russia, Italy aind
France to the United States are greater
than those of Great Britain, who is the
only nation able to pay its debt.
6. British proposals that all' debts be
cancelled are just and normal as every
million loaned was for destruction, mak
ing Europe less able to repay it.
7. If the United States government
does not resist public opinion in can
celling the debts, it must accept payment
in goods since it already lias three
fourths of the world's gold. This will
necessitate a low tariff of free trade.
Referring to Washington's farewell
address, Professor Hirst quoted, "As a
free and enlightened nation, we should
give to mankind an example of a people
always guided by benevolence, and the
reward will repay any temporary loss
or seeming sacrifice."
