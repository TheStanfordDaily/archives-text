# ENGLISH COMEDY TO BE PRODUCED IN RECORD TIME
## "You Never Can Tell," Going Ahead Rapidly After Delay Caused by Chappie Revue 
### 
"You Never Can Tell" will go on
dramatic records as one of the plays
produced in the shortest time in the
history of the campus stage. Less
than two weeks of rehearsals in the
Assembly Hall will see the comedy
ready for presentation. Due to the
Assembly Hall being used for rehears
als of the Hammer and Coffin show,
preliminary work on the play was
done in the Engineering basement
last week, and with this handicap, it
was possible only to begin work on
the lines of the play, thus making
for an unusually slow start.
Concentration of work, it is how
ever anticipated, will make up for this
temporary set-back. Work in all di
visions of production is progressing
at the same time. Side by side with
Coach Davis' daily and nightly re
hearsals of the cast, is the plan of
staging being carried out by C. E.
Coakley, Chrysella Dunker and E. A.
Curtis. The play calls for such sets as
the operating room of a dentist's suite
and the hotel and terrace of an Eng
lish sea-side resort. Every effort will
be made to develop these scenes ac
cording to the latest theories of stage
art. In addition to this preparatory
work, E. Greppin, has under way
schemes for effective lighting arrange
ment, and the matter of costuming
and minor details are also in the pro
cess of preparation.
The entire cast will devote their
Thanksgiving vacation to work on the
rehearsals. With the part of Mr.
Bohun now filled by F. D. Mannoccir,
the personnel is now complete. It re
mains for them to perfect the action
of the play and to make the most of
the compelling brand of humor with
which the comedy is filled. Although
the play is English, dealing with Eng
lish people, the humor is not of the
traditional English type. George
Bernard Shaw is too original and bril
liant a dramatist to give us anything
other than a sparkling comedy of a
kind which has appeals to English and
American audiences alike.
