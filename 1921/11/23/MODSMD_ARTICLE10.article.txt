# GOLF TOURNAMENT WITH CALIFORNIA TO BE DECEMBER 3
## 
### 
Stanford's golf team, captained by
M. S. Rosenblatt, '21. will play the Cali
fornia golf squad on December 3 on the
Jinks of the Beresford Country Club.
The Stanford golf men have won from
the Berkeleyans for two consecutive
years. Four of the five Cardinal players
who defeated California last season by
a 4-2 score, are competing for this year's
squad. Captain Rosenblatt won the
Stanford - California championship in
1920.
The Stanford team lias not definitely
been decided yet. Candidates for the
squad have been trying out on various
links which include Del Monte, Pebble
Reach, Sequoia, Beresford, and Menlo
Park. Several of the certified scores
were under seventy. This manner of
competition is made necessary by the
fact that Stanford has neither a golf
links nor privileges at a golf club. How
ever. the Beresford Country Club will
allow the Stanford team to practice on
its course during the week before the
tournamc.nt with California. The names
of the members of the team will be an
i nounced later.
