will become professor of Geology at
Stanford next year, succeeding Dr.

for the degree of Ph.D., he embraced
an opportunity to join Dr. Willis as
his assistant in China, under the aus
pices of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, and spent twelve months
in the journey through Europe and
Siberia and in geologic investigations
in China.
Upon his return to this'country he
became instructor in geology at the
University of Wisconsin in 1905, and
remained at that institution until

of geology. In 1916 he accepted the

of geology at the University of Illi

he established himself as consulting
geologist in oil and mineral lands,
with offices at Denver.
His work in this field and as a sci
entist connected with the United
States Geological Survey and with ex

bodies has given him first-hand ex

in America and in Alaska, as well as
in China. During the war, among
other war-time activities connected
with his profession, he was in 1917
chosen as the nonresident member of
the California State Petroleum Com
mission. Professor Blackwelder has
written a number of scientific articles
and several books, among them "Re
gional Geology of the United States,"
and with H. H. Barrows, of the Uni
versity of Chicago, a text book "Ele
ments of Geology." He was co-autlior
with Dr. Willis in "Research in China,"
the publication which embodied the
results of their exploration and was
awarded a gold medal by the Geo
graphical Society of France.
