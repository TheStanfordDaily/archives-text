# SECOND CONCERT BY HERTZ TO BE HELD NEXT WEEK
## Symphony Orchestra to Play Wetzler's Overture to "As You Like It" Tuesday Eve 
### 
Alfred Hertz and his band of eighty
five artists will open their second regu
lar series of concerts in the Assembly
J lull next Tuesday evening, with Dvo
rak's "New World Symphony," the
"Sorcerer's Apprentice" by Dukas, a
"Sketch" by Borodin, "The Steppes of
Central Asia," and the new overture on
"As You Like It" by Wetzler, per
formed by Mr. Hertz for the first time
in America. Herman Hans Wetzler, a
citizen of the United States, is known
as a composer principally by his songs
and his music to Shakespeare's "As You
Like It," which was composed in 1917.
The Ovetrure is not to be consirered
as a mere introduction, but as a sym
phonic prologue to the play, giving mu
sical expression to the poetical contents
and the dramatic plot of the comedy,
depicting its chief characters by themes
of motives. The introduction contains
as the motto of the whole work, the
song of the pages from the fifth act,
which symbolizes in its gay and grace
ful mood, the spirit of the play. This
strain reveals, in a sense, the youthful
grace of the romance of Orlando and
Rosalind. â€¢
The main part of the overture starts
with a brilliant sweep and the first theme
of Orlando appears, depicting him in his
chivalrous valor and youthful intensity
of feeling. The Orlando motive leads
into a second theme of mysterious charm
and Rosalind appears. The page's song
also recurs and introduces a dreamy
love scene, a nocturne which breathes
the deep mystery of the forest. Into
this scene of nature, Rosalind's theme in
its original form re-enters; the page's
song is taken up in triumphant fortis
simo interwoven with the themes of
Orlando and Rosalind.
A coda follows which pictures the
exuberant joy of the united lovers, end
ing with a delicate reminiscence of the
page's song. At the end of the over
ture, the sprightly Rosalind theme ap
pears once more.
Tickets for both this concert, and also
the second event to be given on January
10, are on sale at Crandall's Book Store
