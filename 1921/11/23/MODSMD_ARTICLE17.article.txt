# Our Thanksgiving.
## 
### 
Tomorrow is Thanksgiving Day. Already we
have half-formed visions of a table laden with sav
ory viands. We can almost taste the turkey; it seems
that the mince and pumpkin pies are right at hand,
and that the cranberry sauce will soon be set before
us. We picture the happy reunion of families whose
members have been away from the home for months,
or years; we anticipate the general festive joy and
happiness of the occasion.
Yet by many of us, the original, the vital signifi
cance of Thanksgiving is overlooked.
With all peoples it has been the custom to cele
brate the gathering in of the crops with a harvest
home celebration, a festival, generally dedicated to
the Deity whose favor has prospered the people.
Three hundred years ago, the Pilgrims came to
this country, exiled from their homeland, with the
trials and the uncertaintities of a vast wilderness
confronting them. They came to the barren shores
of bleak New England to realize an ideal, the ideal
of freedom of conscience. They found that freedom
in the new world. Though beset by trials, it was
with a spirit of thankfulness that they realized that
here they might worship God and conduct the course
of their lives as they saw fit. The autumn came.
Their crops of corn and of other vegetables assured
them of sustenance through the second winter that
faced them. They were truly thankful, for their new
libertv, and for the abundance of the harvest. They
celebrated the first Thanksgiving Day, giving grate
ful praise to the Creator.
That liberty for which the Pilgrims were thank
ful flourished and grew in the free air of the colo
nies. It blossomed; and this nation emerged, nour
ished and upheld by those liberal institutions engen
dered by the growth of that liberty.
Many, many years have elapsed since that time,
but Liberty is still a vital force. One of the most
influential agencies in America for the preservation
of that liberty in thought, in action, and in belief is
our Alma Mater.
Stanford was conceived in a spirit of freedom, and
it is that spirit of freedom that has made her great.
"The Winds of Freedom Blow" is the motto which
actuates her policies, her life. We must be thankful
for the opportunities which this University, founded
upon liberal principles, has offered us. We must
be thankful for those chances which we have pos
sessed of rendering service to Stanford in return.
We must not forget that our college life is wrapped
in and surrounded by that spirit of freedom which
the originators of Thanksgiving brought to us as a
people. We are thankful for the success with which
we have met in the activities of that institution dur
ing the past year.
As individuals, we must give thanks for the oppor
tunities we have had, the joys we have experienced,
and the blessings which have been secured to us by
the Great Providence. We must be thankful that we
have food, while other young people in the world
are starving; that we have homes, when other hu
man beings have not a place to call their own. We
must be thankful for a respite from the horrors of
war at a time when others are laying, stark and
cold, upon the wintry battlefields. We must be
thankful for the promise of world peace that is
being held out to us. We must be thankful for
statesmen who realize that the world can not go on.
enslaved to Mars, and who are striving to bring
about the reign of the Golden Rule.
Eat, drink, and be merry tomorrow; but remem
ber the true significance of the occasion, and do not
let the day pass without stopping in the midst of
pleasant diversion to take mental stock of those
things for which you should be thankful.

THE DAILY PALO ALTO takes this opportunity
to extend greetings to all its readers, contributors,
and advertisers, thanking them for the supi>ort which
has been given to this paper during the past year.

Tomorrow is Thanksgiving Day. Already we
have half-formed visions of a table laden with sav
ory viands. We can almost taste the turkey; it seems
that the mince and pumpkin pies are right at hand,
and that the cranberry sauce will soon be set before
us. We picture the happy reunion of families whose
members have been away from the home for months,
or years; we anticipate the general festive joy and
happiness of the occasion.
Yet by many of us, the original, the vital signifi
cance of Thanksgiving is overlooked.
With all peoples it has been the custom to cele
brate the gathering in of the crops with a harvest
home celebration, a festival, generally dedicated to
the Deity whose favor has prospered the people.
Three hundred years ago, the Pilgrims came to
this country, exiled from their homeland, with the
trials and the uncertaintities of a vast wilderness
confronting them. They came to the barren shores
of bleak New England to realize an ideal, the ideal
of freedom of conscience. They found that freedom
in the new world. Though beset by trials, it was
with a spirit of thankfulness that they realized that
here they might worship God and conduct the course
of their lives as they saw fit. The autumn came.
Their crops of corn and of other vegetables assured
them of sustenance through the second winter that
faced them. They were truly thankful, for their new
libertv, and for the abundance of the harvest. They
celebrated the first Thanksgiving Day, giving grate
ful praise to the Creator.
That liberty for which the Pilgrims were thank
ful flourished and grew in the free air of the colo
nies. It blossomed; and this nation emerged, nour
ished and upheld by those liberal institutions engen
dered by the growth of that liberty.
Many, many years have elapsed since that time,
but Liberty is still a vital force. One of the most
influential agencies in America for the preservation
of that liberty in thought, in action, and in belief is
our Alma Mater.
Stanford was conceived in a spirit of freedom, and
it is that spirit of freedom that has made her great.
"The Winds of Freedom Blow" is the motto which
actuates her policies, her life. We must be thankful
for the opportunities which this University, founded
upon liberal principles, has offered us. We must
be thankful for those chances which we have pos
sessed of rendering service to Stanford in return.
We must not forget that our college life is wrapped
in and surrounded by that spirit of freedom which
the originators of Thanksgiving brought to us as a
people. We are thankful for the success with which
we have met in the activities of that institution dur
ing the past year.
As individuals, we must give thanks for the oppor
tunities we have had, the joys we have experienced,
