# TOY-FILLED PIE TO BE NOVEL DESSERT AT STANFORD HOME
## 
### 
Cherry pie! With cherries as big as
ostrich eggs! This is the startling phe
nomenon which will be presented on
Thanksgiving to the children of the
Stanford Convalescent Home by the
Women's Service Board. Not to be
eaten is this pie, but to be delightfully
and recklessly pulled apart. For the
cherries are tilled with a veritable zoo
logical garden of toys, and there is one
fruit for each of the fifteen youngsters
who are eating their turkey this year at
the home. Pigs, bulls, dogs, cats, and
monkeys are the proud representatives
of the animal kingdom, while water pis
tols, canoes, and musical clowns, to
gether with marbles of radiant hue, and
piles of jacks all promise joy to
their recipients.
There will be one cherry consisting of
two toys wrapped in red tissue paper
for each child there. The pic will be
baked of brown paper with a large
round hat box for its crust. Helen
Searcy, '22, who has charge of the Con
valescent home under the auspices of
Women's Service Board, is the chief
chef for the occasion.
