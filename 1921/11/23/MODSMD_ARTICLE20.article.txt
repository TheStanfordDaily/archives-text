Dear Editor: —Since seeing Clieer-i-o
I have an idea as to why a certain
little organization which includes soipe
of the keenest women on the campus
met so frequently, so obviously and
upon such (urgent business ,at the
Women's Clubhouse. When Chappie
announced that it would take no
responsibility for the product of their
collective genius we thought it prob
able that they had simply allowed
themselves to soar too high into the
intellectual empyrean for the homely
wit of Chappie, to follow, that their
humor was too subtle and their jokes
too fine. We had a right to expect
something good from the women, and
the snappy opening of the skit did not
disappoint us. But as the show pro
gressed I revised my opinion, and now
I have another theory as to why even
broad-minded and tolerant Chappie
balked at accepting responsibility.
The practice of importing to dances
is an accepted institution at Stanford,
and as such it is subject to razzing.
If the co-eds regard it as detrimental
to their interests, and if their dignity
is willing to make the necessary con
cessions, I see no reason why they
should not undertake a little propa
ganda. There is no objection to their
going beyond the facts, and burles
quing to their heart's content. But
their satire loses its point when the
situation it pictures bears no resembl
ance at all to the situation at Stan
ford. And so, as satire, "Imported
Punch," was off the boat. Moreover,
as a drama it was nothing at all, as
propaganda it was too naive to be
either interesting or effective, and so
far as treatment and taste go, it was
at least provincial. This would not
matter particularly—for we are in
dulgent with our campus writers—ex
cept that it was presented to an audi
ence which contained such an unusu
ally large proportion of imports nad
outsiders. I hope that most of them
enjoyed the opening line and the song,
but went to sleep during the rest of
the skit.
Superficially yours,
3TUDE PREUYNE.
