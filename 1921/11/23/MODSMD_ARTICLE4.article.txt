# Secretary Siezes Roos' Roll, Guesses Game, Gets Gonfalon
## 
### 
"Brick" Morse threw his crutches
away in a frenzy of envy today, when
Alumni Secretary J. E. McDowell
wrested the guessing gonfalon away
from the city sports critic by guessing
the score of the Big Game, and grab
bing Roos Brother's twenty-five dollar
bonus.
Of the several parties to guess the
score of the game to the point, the
alumni Secretary was the first and
was accorded the today of
stocking up in hosiery and other
finery. Mr. McDowell, with becoming
modesty, remarked at an early hour
this morning that he did not intend to
take up active work in the score-guess
ing world.
