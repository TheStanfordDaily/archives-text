# COTILLION WILL HAVE BRILLIANT COLOR DISPLAY
## East Indian Effect Produced With Warm, Bright Colors; Greppin Plans Decorations 
### 
Warm, vivid colors will be used in
the sophomore cotillion decorations.
Ernest Greppin, who is in charge, has
announced that the design will be made
up of capucine orange, baryta yellow,
and blue violet aniline relieved by im
pressionistic splashes of color. Alternate
strips of the orange and yellow gauze
will run the length of the gymnasium,
arching in one big sweep from one side
irr the other. Niches in the wall, be
tween the girders, will be draped in
dark blue-violet. Concealed spotlights
will furnish a dim, indirect illumination.
An Last Indian celebration scene is
what tlie decorators have planned for the
background, according to Greppin. Cos
tumed attendants will further carry out
this idea. Rajahs will dispense the
punch and Sikks will guard the pastry
from the roughs. The whole atmosphere
will be Oriental.
A hidden, reflected lighting system
has been planned. Amber, violet, yel
low, blue-green and similar shades
which are calculated to bring out the
color tones are planned. Too intense a
light will be avoided by the decorator
as he wishes the colors in the ceiling
to blend to some extent.
In direct contrast to cold color schemes
which have been used at previous dances,
Greppin points out that the warm side
of the color scale will predominate. This
makes it unnecessary for women to have
any fear that their dresses will not ap
pear to the best advantage, for lights
have been chosen which do not affect
any color seriously. However, Greppin
suggests deep colors, corresponding to
the lights, as the most successful. There
will be no gray tinges on the cheeks,
no matter what rouge is used, he as
sures.
The drapes will be of cheese-cloth in
stead of the usual tissue paper, for the
cotillion. This is to prevent any pos
sibility of lire, which lias be.en started
by the lights before.
Work at the gymnasium will start
next Thursday.
