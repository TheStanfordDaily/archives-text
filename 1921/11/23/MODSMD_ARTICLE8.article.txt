# BIG GAME STUNT EXPLANATIONS GIVEN
## 
### 
The Stanford bleacher stunts at the
Big Game have brought forth many
queries from the students composing the
section in regard to the stunts that were
executed. Owing to the fact that the
press-box was located directly in rear
of the Stanford section, very few of
the newspaper writers published ac
counts of what happened in the Stan
ford bleachers.
With the singing of the first song, by
means of the hats, four rows of white
then four rows of red, alternating, were
formed horizontally, beginning at the
bottom of the section. The hats were
waved from left to right. This was
changed so that the rows ran vertically
with the hats being waved up and down.
As the team came on the field the
rooters gave them a welcome with con
fetti thrown into the air. As the con
fetti settled the hats were arranged in
a large red "S" on a white background.
The split "S" was the first stunt exe
cuted during the intermission between
halves. The rooting section was in the
shape of a rectangle. The rectangle
was divided into two triangles, the up
per triangle being red and the lower
triangle being white. An "S" was formed
by the entire section. The part of the
"S" in the red triangle was white and
the part in the white triangle was red.
The shaded "S" stunt started with the
entire section white. When the signal
was given by the yell leaders, a large
light pink "S" appeared. This was re
placed by a dark pink "S", then by a
red "S."
A small blue "C" was formed in a
white field. It was located in the upper
part of the rooting section. Similar to
an electric sign the blue "C" was grad
ually replaced by a large red "S."
The spelling out of Stanford proved
to be the crowning feat of the Stanford
rooting acts. The red letters occupied
the entire height of the section. With
the formation of the last letter the col
ored cards were thrown Into the air. A
white "S" on a red background was
created by the rooters with hats. The
colors of this stunt were reversed at
the opening of the fourth quarter.
