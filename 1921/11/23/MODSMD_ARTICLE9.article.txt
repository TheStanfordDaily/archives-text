contests, the Executive Committee
will nominate four men. These men
will tryout with the two assistant yell
leaders for the current year at a final
game or contest. Following the final
tryout the student body will elect the
yell leader and his two assistants for
the following year at a Quad Election
to be held within the next week."

Plans for changing the method of
electing the Yell Leader and his two
assistants were adopted at the regular
weekly meeting of the Executive Com
mittee last night. The new plan pro
vides for the election of the yell lead
ers during the spring quarter for the
following year. In this way the in
efficiency of the old system of choos
ing assistant yell leaders may be
avoided, and they will be ready to
take up their duties at the beginning
of the autumn quarter. The plan as
adopted by the Executive Comittee is
as follows:
"Two assistant yell leaders and the
head yell leader shall be elected at
a regular Quad Election to be held
during the spring quarter. The head
yell leader shall be elected from the
assistants of that year. The assist
ants shall be chosen in the following
manner. During various athletic con
tests in the winter quarter, members
of the sophomore class will be given
a chance to try out before the bleach
ers. After all have had an opportunity
to try out over a period of several
contests, the Executive Committee
will nominate four men. These men
will tryout with the two assistant yell
leaders for the current year at a final
game or contest. Following the final
tryout the student body will elect the
yell leader and his two assistants for
the following year at a Quad Election
to be held within the next week."
The Executive Committee received
a letter from the President of the
Student Body at the University of
California stating that it had been
ascertained that certain members of
the freshman class of the University
of California had instigated the aero
plane raid upon the bon fire last
Thursday evening. According to the
letter, the guilty parties have not as
yet been apprehended, but the authori
ties expect to search them out. The
Executive Committee voted to reply
to the letter, thanking the University
of California authorities for their ef
forts to enforce the agreement be
tween the two universities, and dis
claiming for Stanford any knowledge
of the painting of the "C."
