# S. F. ORCHESTRA WILL PLAY HERE TUESDAY NIGHT
## Entire Personnel of Eighty Five Musicians Ready For Assembly Hall Appearance 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Students who remember the symphony
concerts of last season, and especially
the glorious program during the spring
quarter in the Memorial Church for
their benefit, will appreciate what a treat
is in store for tomorrow night, when
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
with its entire personnel of eighty-five
artists under Alfred Hertz, is to play in
the Assembly Hall.
The program will include Dvorak's
"New World Symphony," the humorous
"Sorcerer's Apprentice," by Dukas, a new
and beautiful overture by Wetzler based
on Shakespeare's "As You Like It," and
a dreamy Oriental "Sketch of the Steppes
of Central Asia," by Borodin.
Borodin's symphonic poem describes
in some very vivid music the passage of
a cavaran across the desert under es
cort of Russian soldiers. By means of
two themes, one Russian and one Orien
tal, which subsequently mingle in the
harmonic scheme, the composer con
trives to effect a musical reproduction
of the figures in the foreground of his
picture. The immensity and monotony
of the prairie is suggested by a long
and persistent note given to the violins.
The work in its composer's lifetime was
considered the most popular of all his
compositions.
The following description, which was
written on the fly-leaf of the score, ex
plains the significance of the music:
"Out of the silence of the sandy steppes
of Central Asia come the sounds of a
peaceful Russian song. There are heard,
too, the melancholy strains of Oriental
melodies and the stamping of approach
ing horses and camels. A caravan es
corted by Russian soldiers crosses the
measureless desert, pursuing its way,
free from care, under the protection of
Russian arms. The caravan moves ever
forward. The songs of tho Russians
and those of the Asiatics mingle in com
mon harmony, their refrain gradually
dying away in the distance."
Tickets will be on sale all day tomor
row at the Stanford Bookstore for the
benefit of campus residents, and one
half the house will be kept 011 sale at
Crandall's in Palo Alto.
Single tickets for tomorrow's even
ing's concert may be purchased for $1.50
and 75 cents. Season tickets are $2 for
two concerts for the most desirable
seats.
