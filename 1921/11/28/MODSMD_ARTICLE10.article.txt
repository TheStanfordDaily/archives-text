# HANDBALL PLAYERS WILL TRY OUT FOR U .C .TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Tryouts which will determine the
personnel of the Stanford handball
team which meets California next
Saturday afternoon at the Berkeley
Y. M. C. A. box courts, will be held
at the Encina gymnasium every after
noon this week. Two doubles andi
two singles representatives are to be
selected from the twenty-two men who
are trying out.
The box courts at Berkeley are a
handicap to the local players, although
some of them have had previous ex
perience on that kind of court. In the
singles, Koba, tht? Japanese flash,
Lowenstein, who won from California
last year, Mark Cohen and Rutter, are
conceded the advahtage in the tryouts
because of their experience on the box
courts.
There is lots of competitipn in the
doubles tryouts. The Cohen brothers,
veterans of two years ago, are in the
running again. Rutter and Reticker
who won the recent open doubles tour
nament, have a good chance of being
one of the two pairs selected.
The small, regulation black hand
ball will be used in the tourney. Circle
"S's" of the second class, will be given
those who play against the Blue and
Gold.
