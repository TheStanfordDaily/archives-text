# BRANDSTEN HOPES FOR VICTORY OVER OLYMPIC SWIMMERS
## 
### 
With the attention of swimming fol
lowers in northern California fixed upon
the outcome of the Stanford-Olympic
Club return meet here next Saturday,
Coach Brandsten is priming the Cardinal
mermen to turn the tables on the club
men. The Winged "O's" 40 to 27 vic
tory over the Stanford squad, and the
presence of several national stars on the
San Francisco team, bear witness to the
fact that it's going to be a large order
for Brandsten's charges to fill.
The Olympic Club is reputed to be the
strongest aquatic aggregation on the Pa
cific Coast, and it seems to have the jinx
on the Cardinal mermen. Not for the
last two years has a Stanford team been
able to emerge triumphant. In water
polo the Olympics are the national jun
ior champions, but they had to use all
the skill they had to win from the Card
inal seven, 4 to 1, in the recent cham
pionships.
The Cardinal linenp present? an ex
ceptionally well-balanced aggregation,
with capable performers in every event.
The names of the Austin brothers,
Drake, Fletcher, Greppin, Miller, Pink
ston, and White have been well-known
to swimming followers for two years
past. They are all good for points, and
the result of the meet will probably de
pend on the third places.
Which ever team wins, however, Stan
ford should have a monopoly on the
points in the diving. In Pinkston, White
and Snedden, Brandsten has a trio that
is without peer in the United States.
The presence of Pinkston, who is un
equaled in the diving event throughout
the world, rather overshadows the work
of White and Snedden. White was in
eligible for intercollegiate competition
last year, but he took second in the Pa
cific Athletic Association champion
ships. Snedden won the diving for the
1923 freshmen team, and was not in the
University last year.
