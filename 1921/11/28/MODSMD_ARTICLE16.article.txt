# Only Twenty-One Cotillion Tickets Are Left for Sale
## 
### 
Tickets for Â»the sophomore cotillion
are almost gone, according to reports
from the bookstore, where they are on
sale. Out of the 225 that were placed
on sale there were only twenty-one left
this morning.
A list is being kept of those who buy
tickets this year, in order to eJiminate
the trouble former cotillion committees
have had in respect to substitution for
lost cards. There will be no hesitancy
this year in pairing up lost tickets and
found owners.
Programs may be obtained at the
bookstore tomorrow.
