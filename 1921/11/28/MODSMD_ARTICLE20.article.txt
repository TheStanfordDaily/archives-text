# TOPIC SETTLED FOR CLASH WITH THREE COLLEGES
## Debaters Prepare For Battle With Bruin Squad; Friday, in Stanford Assembly Hall 
### 
The question to be debated in the an
nual tri-state debate has been tentatively
dccided upon by the schools which are
to participate in the contest. Substan
tially, it reads as follows: "Resolved,
that Congress Should Levy a Tax Upon
Manufacturers' Sales â€”Manufacturers to
Be Defined As Stated in the Last United
States Census."
One of the teams chosen will make the
trip north to Seattle to debate the Uni
versity of Washington there. The other
one will remain at home and meet the
aggregation representing the University
of Oregon. This inter-state contest will
be held the first Friday in March.
Coach Emerson plans to have a meet
ing of all tryoutees next Monday after
noon with the end in view of working
out a well-balanced and simple woTtling
for the statement of the question. Every
one who plans to participate should hand
his name in at once to Coach Emerson
in his office in the English building.
The tryouts will be conducted the first
week of the winter quarter. Two men
and an alternate will be selected for each
of the two teams. The speeches in the
preliminaries will be limited to four min
utes, with three minutes allowed for re
buttals. Professor Bassett, co-operating
with Debating Coach Emerson, will
choose the men who are to represent
Stanford in this intercollegiate contest.
Meanwhile, the combined efforts of
the Public Speaking Department and the
individual men on the squad are being
devoted to defeating the University of
California in the supreme forensic
classic of the Pacific Coast. Through
the kindness of G. T. Clark, a room has
been especially set aside in the library
and every night the varsity squad can
be found there digging deep into pon
derous volumes in search of suitable ma
terial upon the subject of the "Canal
Tolls," or rehearsing one by one their
speeches in order to perfect and polish
tjieir delivery.
The question as it now stands, "Re
solved, That Congress Should Pass a
Law Exempting American Coast-wisc
Shipping From Payment of the Panama
Canal Tolls," is a very timely one at this
time. There is a bill now pending in
Congress upon this very subject. It has
already passed one house there and is
due to appear on the calendar of the
other one in the near future. It has al
ready occasioned much heated discussion
in Congress, and the debate in regard
to it promises to be very lively.
The student body committee upon de
bating is busy making arrangements for
the debate. They are, now attempting
t co-operate with California in the se
lection of the judges for the encounter.
They have already submitted one list of
fifteen men to the institution across the
bay, and all but three of these were
challenged. Another list is now being
prepared to be presented for the ap
proval of the Berkeleyites.
This year the debate will be held here,
as it alternates year by year between
the two institutions. For the last sev
eral years, Stanford has been defeated
by the teams representing the Gold and
Blue, and this year they are making a
super-human effort to bring victory to
the Quad.
