A few days ago the Stanford Stadium was dedi
cated. The thousands who came to our University
to see the annual football classic with California
were amazed at the extent of the completed project
which met their eyes when they took their seats in
the bleachers. In a little less than six months Stan
ford men and women had quietly accomplished a
vast undertaking, whose evidence will remain as long
as nature spares the slopes of the Stanford Stadium.
The completion of the Stadium was a tangible sign
to the outward world that Stanford is a live and
growing institution, that it is virile, and that Stan
ford men and women are doers as well as thinkers.
In a few more weeks, two more of Stanford con
struction projects will be dedicated. The Stanford
Union, with its accommodations for those students
who now must use great ingenuity in finding satis
factory eating places and its promised relief for the
congested living quarters of the University, will be
a welcome addition. The basketball pavilion, a dis
tinct Stanford enterprise, financed by the student
body, will also be ready to accommodate spectators,
and the basketball teams which will play here in the
coming season.
They are as tangible evidences of the living spirit
of Stanford as the stadium.
The need for the Stanford Union addition was
great. It was occasioned through the growth of the
Stanford student body to an unprecedented extent.
A university, like a business, or any enterprise, is
dead when people do not seek its wares. If they do
not demand the article which is furnished by a busi
ness or an institution, it is a sign that that article is
not worth while. The demand for entrance at Stan
ford, in spite of limited accommodations and high
tuition fee, shows that this university is worth while
in its life and its activites.
Stanford has always mantained the ideal of the
all-around development of its students, mentally,
morally, and physically. In perhaps no other insti
tution in the land is there as widespread an individ
ual interest in sport as we find here. This brought
about the need for the new basketball pavilion.
Crowds which in past years have been unsuccessful
in all efforts to witness basketball contests will this
season be accommodated, through the completion
of this project.
Stanford spirit is well known. It may take the
form of determined effort in face of odds. It may
be the "fight" of the football field. But essentially
it is the spirit of knowing what is wanted, what is
necessary, and then unceasing effort until that end is
secured. Stadium, Stanford Union, and Basketball
pavilion are all the tangible evidences of that form
of Stanford spirit.
