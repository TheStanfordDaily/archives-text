Collegiate humor reaches its height in the practice
of "pulling the trolley" on the local car line. No
doubt this was funny the first fifty times it happened.
Everybody made allowances for the wags, and dis
counted their lack of originality. But it has now
reached the stage of a daily occurrence, to be re
garded as a matter of course. No evening is com
plete without its electrical display, followed by a
chorus of guffaws as the passengers are put in
darkness.
Such a condition is inexcusable. Not only does
it reflect on the intelligence of the students as a
whole, but it causes an actual money loss to the
people who are striving to give the University trans
portation service. Each car has its own schedule, to
which the motorman must adhere in order to pre
vent congestion and delay. By forcing the motor
man to go to the rear of the car and replace the
trolley, however comical he may seem while per
forming this task, the humorists are nevertheless de
stroying the one thing everybody wants â€”adequate
street car facilities.
With all due respect to the ancient "Kampus

Karline" wheeze, we feel that deliberate attempts to
hinder the service are out of place, and an indication
of the pinheadedness of the jokesters.
