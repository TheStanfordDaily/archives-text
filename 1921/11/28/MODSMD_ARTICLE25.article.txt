East vs. West seems to be the big topic of con
versation nowadays, outside of post-mortem alibis on
smokeups. We have received thousands of letters
from Cabbage fans offering suggestions for a New
Year's Day Roman Holiday... We are printing a few
of the remarks below:
• * •
"Sir:—The ideal game for New Year's Day is un
doubtedly the proposed match between the Sing-Sing
eleven and the San Quentin wrecking gang. This
would give us a true line on this East vs. West dope.
I'm sure the Eastern Penitentiary Conference would
agree to the trip, if the boys promised not to try to
get away with anything. Yours,
ONE MYSELF."
* * *
But, on the other hand—
"Gents: —Comparative scores render a New Year's
Day game unnecessary. Look at this: Sing-Sing, 0;
Institute of Knitting, 128. San Quentin, 96; Police
Force, 0. Delaware state, 368; Texas "State, G]/ 3 .
The West is supreme! I'm all for breaking training
and forgetting about it. Sincerely,
STAR FOOTBALL PLAYER."
* * •
What do YOU think? Or don't you? (No, lady,
this is not a prize contest. We're broke.) Write out
your opinion and send it to somebody else.

The guy that wrote
This kind of stuff
Last Wednesday
Was right.
If everybody else
Is going to write
This kind of stuff
WE'LL QUIT
Writing anything else.

(By Kabbage Intercollegiate News Mangling Associa
tion). —Tomito University, Oon-To, Japan, 2.—"Not
on your life!" said Coach Komoto today when asked
what the chances were for an East vs. West contest
in the new stadium, New Year's Day. "It would kill
the League of Nations. We only need eleven on our
side —ten men and the referee. . . ."

A ditpatch from the University of Utah indicates that
co-eds there have formed a new equitation club, called,
"The Trotters."
* * •
Goofy Gus remarks that the best name he ever knew
for these clubs was "The Bouncers."
» • *
But then, we're not in the Bowery now.
* * *
We know of at least one prominent riding club now
In existence here. It's composed of the guys who grab
rides off the karline by hanging on the back, out of
sight of the conductor.
• • *
A good name for this organization might by "The
Hangers." Taken correctly, that sounds as hard-boiled
as "The Bouncers."
* * *
... Popular Superstitions —That the conductor doesn't see
you when you grab a free ride.

Our education department is working overtime today.
Most of the mid-quarters are through, so Kabbages must
instill a little more knowledge into the receptive brain
of the reader.

HOW TO MAKE HISTORY EASY
Learn the following famous quotations. After you
have learned them, repeat them, standing before a mir
ror. If you still think you're all right, apply here for a
job writing Cabbages.
• • •
"My kingdom for a course." —Holdover, Oct. 1.
"I can not tell a lie: I did it." —Andy Smith.
"We've just begun to fight."—Ex. Committee.
"Isn't the music wonderful? Isn't the floor nice? I
like your necktie. Ha-ha-ha-ha, you clever thing."—
(Gent first guessing who springs this quotation will be
awarded Congressional Medal of Honor if he does some
brave feat in some future war.)

GRAMMAR AS IS
We advocate the use of the library more. As it is
now, you go in there and sometimes you don't hear
hardly a sound. Let's pep it up, fellows, and get going.
Make the ole library cheerful. Brink your rattles and
guns along and make it a popular place. Even the profs
say it ought to be used more.
• * •
The Builders' Union held up the Students' Union.
Goofy Gus now asks if the Students' Union will hold
up the students.
• • •
An unfair question, we say. After the recent fall we
got token out of us in smokeups, we doubt if anybody
could hold us up—not even the San Francisco Chapter
of the Professional Gunmen of America.
* » •
WAR! WAR!! WAR!!!—Is hereby declared on the
guy who wants to know what time it is when we're
running for a street car. No quarter asked or given.

By Kabbage Intercollegiate News Mangling Association
Hoo-Hoo College, Monte Vista, Cal., Nov. 2S. —Thanks-
giving passed off nicely here. None of the boys were
killed, and only a slight majority seemed under the
weather. President (deleted) expressed the wish that
Thanksgiving would come two or three times a year.
"We ought to be thankful," was his succulent remark.
