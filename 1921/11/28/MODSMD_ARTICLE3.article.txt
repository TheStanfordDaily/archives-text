# CROSS-COUNTRY RUN WON BY CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
University of California runners took
the first five places in the annual Stan
ford-California cross-country run held
Saturday morning. Frost, of the Blue
and Gold team, captured first honors in
27:7 2-5 time which lowered last year's
time for the race by nearly 15 seconds.
The teams ran over a four and a half
mile course, which went through the
Stanford campus and back through the
hills. Wilson of California finished
three seconds later than Frost. Seymour
of Stanford came in seventh, followed
by McCombic, also a Cardinal runner.
