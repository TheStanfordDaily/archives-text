# SORORITIES AT CALIFORNIA CHANGE METHOD OF BIDDING
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Berkeley, Nov. 28 (P. I. N. S.) â€”Sorori-
ties of the University of California have
adopted the "preferential" system of
rushing, where bids are handed to
rushees through the medium of the
dean of women, eliminating unfair com
petition, rivalry between the sororities,
and outside influence. No woroan will
know the number of bids she may re
ceive and personal rushing, and unfair
competition will cease.
