# STANFORD RUGBY TOUR WELCOMED IN NORTH
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby invasion of Canadian
fields this Chri>tmas vacation has been
welcomed by northern* sport writers.
They were unanimous in their approval
of Stanford's sportmanslike methods
last year, and when it became known
that this year the red jerseyed players
would again travel north many of these
writers hastened to offer their assistance
to the rugby management. Typical of
these offers is the following letter re
ceived by Henry Maloney from Everett
G. Leslie, sport editor of the Vancouver
Daily World:
"I attended the meeting of the Van
couver Rugby Union last night and heard
a letter from you read to the effect that
we would have the pleasure of the Stan
ford team here again this year. For my
self, I was glad to hear this, as you
fellows have always been good sports in
the game and the fans are looking for
ward to some more games this Christ
mas.
"If you would send some pictures as
soon as you can, together with some
stories, I would be more than pleased to
use them in The World and boost your
team. If you could do this I would be
very much obliged.
"(Signed) Everett G. Leslie."
