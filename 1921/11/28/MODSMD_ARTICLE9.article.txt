# "YOU NEVER CAN TELL" COMBINES SHAW'S HUMOR AND UNIQUE SITUATIONS
## 
### 
Filled to the fullest with good rich
comedy of every existing variety, uni
que situations and novel plot-surprises,
"You Never Can Tell" will this week
be whipped into final shape for its pre
sentation on next Saturday evening.
After a series of intensive rehearsals
during the Thanksgiving vacation the
various members of the cast have
their parts well in hand and these are
now being polished so as to bring out
to the best advantage Shaw's widely
known brand of wit and humor.
Interest centers around the affairs
and fortunes of a struggling young
dentist, played by Norris James, who
is in the very elementary stages of
starting out in the world of business.
In fact, the first rise of the curtain
shows him in the process of perform
ing his first dental operation. He does
not give the impression of being a
workman, takes his professional man
ner lightly and has an off-hand, absent
minded method of treating his pati
ents, as if the whole process were a
joke. This is not always appreciated
by the victims. He is, however, the
typical ambitious young man, and this
ambition leads him to succumb in two

minutes, by actual count, to the at
tractions of a certain young lady, Miss
Gloria Cl&ndon, who visits his dental
establishment.
The part of Gloria is played by
Edythe Baylis. Gloria is the twentieth
century girl. She has been educated
along her mother's advanced line of
thought, and has already five romances
to her credit. The mother, Mrs. Lan
frey Clandon (Constance Tamplin) is
one of the most important personages
in the play. She is the author of a
varied collection of "Twentieth Cen
tury Treatises" including original
theories concerning cooking, creeds,
clothing, conduct, children and par
ents, and it is because of her ardent
devotion to her advanced beliefs that
her husband, now twenty years ab
sent, has found it beyond his power
to live in harmony with the doctrines
to which her life is devoted. She is
the incarnation of the women's
Rights Movement, one of the original
old guard.
Around the interests of this trio
hovers the spirit of the unexpected.
Their affairs and difficulties are the
basis for much of the fun and dash
ing comedy of the play.
