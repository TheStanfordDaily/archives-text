Finding the Elusive
Human Want
Isn't there a lot of satisfaction in possess
ing a hat that you KNOW is becoming, a hat
that is so good looking that it draws forth a
remark of envied admiration from a friend ?
* Whether your baffling desire be a smart
v
hat, a pair of brogues of the latest gusto or
the latest in an overcoat, you will derive this
true satisfaction by reading Daily Palo Alto
advertisements.
Watch the advertisements and see how the
merchants are making the effort to enable you
to realize this satisfaction. Then do your
Christmas shopping accordingly.
This is the fifth of a series of ads
on the value of Daily Palo Alto advertising.
