# SIXTY MEN NOW OUT IN PRACTICE FOR BASKETBALL
## Three of Varsity Team Will Return; '24 Freshman Five to Furnish Good Material 
### 
More than sixty men reported to
Coach Gene Van Gent as candidates for
Stanford's 1922 basketball varsity in the
first practice of the season held yester
day afternoon.
While the prospects for the year are
nut as bright as they were at this time
last year, when seven "S" men returned
to the. University, it is believed that Van
Gent will be able to form a strong quin
tet from the material that is on hand.
Captain Jimmy Davies, '22, will prob
ably not be out for work until next
quarter as he is still weak from an op
eration for appendicitis that he under
went a month ago. Davies played for
ward last year and the year before, and
forms the nucleus around which Van
Gent will build his combination.
Dick Richmond, another veteran with
two years varsity experience, reported
for practice yesterday. Richmond played
running guard last season and will prob
ably hold that position this year.
"Lefty" Rogers, who won his "S" at
forward last season, is the third of last
year's varsity who will report for action
this year.
The man who will be missed most
from the Card court team is "Swede"
Righter, who starred for three years at
center and forward. His place will
likely be taken by Bob Janssen, center on
Duffy Seay's freshmen five last year.
Janssen plays much the same kind of a
game as Righter, and the dopesters have
him filling the middle portion of the
court already.
Fred Anderson, who broke into sev
eral games last season, looks like a con
tender for some position. Anderson is
fast and has had plenty of experience.
"Scotchy" Campbell, varsity football
player and one of the guards on last
year's freshmen five, is considered a
strong candidate for the varsity. Camp
bell loomed up as a star in the few
games that he was able to play in basket
hall last year.
Other men from the. freshmen team
of last season who look like good var
sity material arc "Nip" McHose, for
ward; A1 Loewenstein, forward; Neil
Granger, forward, Smith, Atwill, and
Manoccir.
Varsity basketball men will start prac
tice temporarily at 5 o'clock in the aft
ernoon.
It is doubtful if any games will be
scheduled for this quarter, and it is be
lieved that the first game of the season
will be played in the new basketball pa
vilion.
