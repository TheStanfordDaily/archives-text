# HERTZ TO OPEN CONCERT SERIES WITH SYMPHONY
## "New World Symphony," "Sorcerer's Apprentice," "Roman Carnival" Feature 
### 
Alfred Hertz and the members of his
Symphony Orchestra will open their
second series of Stanford concerts with
the program which they will present this
evening at 8:15 in the Assembly Hall.
Mr. Hertz has announced a program
for this event which, it is anticipated,
will be one of the .most beautiful ever
played here. It includes the famous
"New World Symphony" by Dvorak,
"The Sorcerer's Apprentice," by Du
kas, one of the cleverest modern French
writers, "The Roman Carnival," by
Berlioz, and other interesting compo
sitions.
One of the most popular of the num
bers to be played tonight is "The Sor
cerer's Apprentice," by Dukas, a story
in music which has aroused tremendous
enthusiasm among its hearers.
"L'Appernti Sorcier," or "The Sor
cerer's Apprentice," entitled on the
score "an orchestral scherzo," has lor
its pictorial basis the poem by the same
name, written by Goethe in 1796. The
poem concerns itself with the apprentice
of a magician, who, when his master
leaves the house, proceeds to experiment
with the magic formula he has heard his
master utter. Using the cabalistic words
employed by his master, the apprentice
commands a broom to' go to the shore
and fetch water.
The broom obeys and when all the
pitchers are filled, the apprentice is dis
mayed to discover that he cannot re
member the magic utterance that will
compel the broom to stop. Soon the
room is flooded with water and still the
indefatigible utensil hurries to and from
the waters' edge. In desperation the
apprentice resolves to stop its progress
with a hatchet. As the broom comes
in with its liquid burden the young man
wields the weapon and the broom is
split in twain.
Before the sorcerer's apprentice '.has
had time to utter a sigh of relief at the
satisfactory ending of his troubles his
dismay is doubly increased. For now
both parts of the broom are speeding
to the river bank. As the water splashes
over and around the steps and hall the
apprentice -creams for help. And help
arrives. The sorcerer enters at that mo
ment and takes in the situation. He com
mands the carriers to desist and both
parts of the broom fly into their corner.
