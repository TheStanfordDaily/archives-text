# Dentists Are Dentists; Teeth Are Teeth—But "You Never Can Tell"
## 
### 
You know the feeling ?
The grim confines of a dentist's den—
the torture chair with its fitful twists
and revolutions, row upon row of
probes, forceps, bicept, pincers, a slen
der machine provided with a stand,
pedal, and exaggerated winch which you
recognize as that diabolical device, the
drill! More tools—wrenches, saws,
knives—tier upon tier of instruments of
torture —a glittering array too horrible,
too gruesome for mortal sight. The at
mosphere of carbolic acid and chloro
form. Last of all, a huge tank of laugh
ing gas. .
Then the demon dentist himself! He
will extract that molar or commit mur
der. Suppose he wagers to out-Parker
Parker—the stakes are six weeks' room
and board? Remember he is desperate
—and then, too —"You Never Can Tell."
