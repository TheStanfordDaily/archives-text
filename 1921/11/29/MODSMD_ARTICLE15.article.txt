# COAST STARS TO PLAY EXHIBITION MATCHES
## Johnston, Griffin, Kinsey and Bates Will Officially Open New Varsity Tennis Courts 
### 
Three matches will be played in an
exhibition which will dedicate the new
varsity tennis courts next Thursday aft
ernoon. In the lirst two matches, the
Cardinal tennis fans will have the op
portunity of seeing the best brand of
singles play on the Pacific Coast. The
third game will be a doubles match.
In the first of the single matches, Wil
liam Johnston, second ranking player of
the world and member of the 1921 Davis
Cup team that successfully defended the
world's title last September, 'will oppose
Clarence ("Peck") Griffin. Griffin rates
as one of the best singles players in Cali
fornia, and the contest between the two
should prove exceptionally fast.
Howard Kinsey, of the California Club
of San Francisco, and Wallace Bates,
captain of the California varsity for
1921, will face each other in the second
singles match. Kinsey is the present
holder of the state doubles champion
ship and ranks high in national rating.
Bates is a dangerous man at all stages
of 'the game, and will force Kinsey to
the limit. Kinsey and Griffin play John
ston and Bates in the doubles match of
the exhibition.
The varsity courts to be dedicated
Thursday are probably the best built
and most up-to-date on the Coast to
day. Special graded asphalt was used
in laying the courts and a new system of
drainage employed, making it possible
for play to be resumed at once after a
rain. Special bleachers will be placed
around the courts for the matches Thurs
day.
