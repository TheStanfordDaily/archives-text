# HIRST SPEAKS ON SOCIALISM AND SOVIET SYSTEM
## History of English Radical Movement Told; Bolshevik Rule Said to be Modified 
### 
"The really common thing in this life
is not the desire to abolish property but
a love of property," said Professor F.
W. Hirst in his lecture on "British So
cialism and Russian Communism," given
in the Little Theater Monday afternoon
at 4 o'clock, and he went on to show
that the inherent desires of the people
fundamentally direct the movements of
a society.
Socialism began to exist in England
after the Reform Bill of 1832, and the
term itself is particularly modern, ac
cording to Professor Hirst. In England
it sprang from the inborn desire of the
race for personal liberty, for in the
words of Professor Hirst, "The English
both in the old and new world has
a inherent love for personal liberty and
a horror of policemen."
Professor Hirst described the period
from 1832 to 1884 in England as one of
emancipation. It was during this period
that the government began to look after
the consumer and let the producer take
care of himself, which attitude was dem
onstrated in the throwing open of the
ports. This same wave of emancipation
did away with religious privilege and
attacked the landlord. Not by confisca
tion but by a system of graduated taxa
tion, was this movement against land
lords affected. The schools of liberalism
—the Manchester school and that of the
Philosophic radical's—aided in these re
forms.
"The reform of local government be
gan immediately after the Reform Bill
with the Poor Law Amendment Act of
1834," Professor Hirst went on to state.
The name of Mr. Phillip Snowden
was given by the speaker as foremost
Socialist of England. It was he who
first proposed the system of the grad
uated income tax, which has now
reached an upper limit of eleven or
twelve shillings on a pound, practically
driving some of the old rural residents
out of house and -home.
According to Professor Hirst, the
present Socialistic movement in England
is split into three parties. The first of
these is the Independent Labor Party,
standing for peace, free trade, and the
ideal society as foreshadowed by Karl
Marx, and proposing to work through
Parliamentary action. Secondly, was
mentioned the Fabian Society, which
wants to educate labor unions and is
founded on a general love of red tape;
and thirdly, the Guild movement, which
supports the idea of reintroducing a sort
of mediaeval guild to control factories
and put an end to "wage slavery."
In speaking of Russian Communism,
Professor Hirst said: "It now appears
to have completed a vicious circle." Pro
ceedings of the Soviet government in
the last few months propose economic
collaboration with other powers as one
of the principles of government. Pro
fessor Hirst believes that economic re
storation and relief of Russia are neces
sary to the permanent establishment of
peace, but he does not think it possible
to accomplish this by the use of force.
"Force is no remedy," said Professor
Hirst, and he concluded, "No society
will ever be successfully organized which
does not meet the desire of human be
ings to acquire for themselves."

1834," Professor Hirst went on to state.
The name of Mr. Phillip Snowden
was given by the speaker as foremost
Socialist of England. It was he who
first proposed the system of the grad
uated income tax, which has now
reached an upper limit of eleven or
twelve shillings on a pound, practically
driving some of the old rural residents
out of house and -home.
According to Professor Hirst, the
present Socialistic movement in England
is split into three parties. The first of
these is the Independent Labor Party,
standing for peace, free trade, and the
ideal society as foreshadowed by Karl
Marx, and proposing to work through
Parliamentary action. Secondly, was
mentioned the Fabian Society, which
wants to educate labor unions and is
founded on a general love of red tape;
and thirdly, the Guild movement, which
supports the idea of reintroducing a sort
of mediaeval guild to control factories
and put an end to "wage slavery."
In speaking of Russian Communism,
Professor Hirst said: "It now appears
to have completed a vicious circle." Pro
ceedings of the Soviet government in
the last few months propose economic
collaboration with other powers as one
of the principles of government. Pro
fessor Hirst believes that economic re
storation and relief of Russia are neces
sary to the permanent establishment of
peace, but he does not think it possible
to accomplish this by the use of force.
"Force is no remedy," said Professor
Hirst, and he concluded, "No society
will ever be successfully organized which
does not meet the desire of human be
ings to acquire for themselves."
"The really common thing in this life
is not the desire to abolish property but
a love of property," said Professor F.
W. Hirst in his lecture on "British So
cialism and Russian Communism," given
in the Little Theater Monday afternoon
at 4 o'clock, and he went on to show
that the inherent desires of the people
fundamentally direct the movements of
a society.
Socialism began to exist in England
after the Reform Bill of 1832, and the
term itself is particularly modern, ac
cording to Professor Hirst. In England
it sprang from the inborn desire of the
race for personal liberty, for in the
words of Professor Hirst, "The English
both in the old and new world has
a inherent love for personal liberty and
a horror of policemen."
Professor Hirst described the period
from 1832 to 1884 in England as one of
emancipation. It was during this period
that the government began to look after
the consumer and let the producer take
care of himself, which attitude was dem
onstrated in the throwing open of the
ports. This same wave of emancipation
did away with religious privilege and
attacked the landlord. Not by confisca
tion but by a system of graduated taxa
tion, was this movement against land
lords affected. The schools of liberalism
—the Manchester school and that of the
Philosophic radical's—aided in these re
forms.
"The reform of local government be
gan immediately after the Reform Bill
with the Poor Law Amendment Act of
1834," Professor Hirst went on to state.
