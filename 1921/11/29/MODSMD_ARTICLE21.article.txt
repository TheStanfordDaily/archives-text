Tonight Stanford will entertain one of the best
loved figures of the music world in California—
Alfred Hertz, conductor of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra. This widely esteemed wizard of
the symphony has already established himself in the
regard of campus concert-goers. His first series of
concerts which were given here last year were bril
liant events which will not be forgotten. A program
given by Hertz and his orchestra of eighty-five
skilled musicians is one of the most desirable and val
uable events which can befall a university.
The concert this evening opens Stanford's musi
cal season. It will be an impressive beginning of a
worthwhile phase of university life which is in
process of development and worthy of every form of
encouragement. We may well be proud of the
strides made in musical undertakings on the campus
last year.
The series of events which have been arranged
for this season offer even more interesting pros
pects, and no more auspicious beginning of our mu
sical year could have been presented than the reap
pearance this evening of the San Francisco Orches
tra and its noted director. M. J. C.
