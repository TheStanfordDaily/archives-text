# The
						Next Major Sport.

### 
Basketball now takes the place of football on the
major sports calendar. Sixty-one stalwarts reported
to Coach Gene Van Gent yesterday to practice and
work out for positions on the Varsity quintet. A
like number of first-year students signed up for
freshman basketball under Coach Duffy Seay.
From now until the end of the quarter competition
for places on the two first-string squads will be very
keen. Following the holidays the candidates will
be weeded out and real intensive work of building
two Stanford court teams will be started. Indica
tions point to two very strong quintets, despite the
fact that he varsity team will have to be built with
but two veterans as a nucleus. The presence of sev
eral men who gained some experience on the first
string last year will aid the coach in forming a strong
quintet.
These will be the first Stanford teams to perform
in the new basketball pavilion that is now nearing
completion. It will be their ambition to dedicate the
new courts properly. Student support should be
lined up squarely behind the basketball players and
the coaches as it was behind the football squads.
