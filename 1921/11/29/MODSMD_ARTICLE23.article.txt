# Those Many Miles.

College life is the life of the pedestrian. If it were
possible to compute the steps taken by the average
university student during one day it would be found
that he is on a par with the man who plows his two
acres of ground a day. The popular idea is that in
order to gain rest men retire to their books for a
period of time. This is given the lie by the average
college student. He is always on the move because
he carries his books with him.
Usually the student rises about seven-fifty and
runs to his eight o'clock. From his first class he or
she will usually take a route along some edge of the
quadrangle to the second. This continues through
out the morning and then comes the walk to lunch.
Then thefe follows another Edward Payson Weston
to the afternoon sessions. After these comes the
trudge to the gymnasium, the bookstore, the post
office, and then home for the evening meal. Dinner
over, there follows the walk to the Library or the
carline and the movies. If it is the movies the stu
dent spends the quietest two of his waking hours.
You would naturally think that two hours spent in
the Library would be the same as two in the cinema,
but they are not.
Mr. and Miss Student usually flash into the Li
brary shortly after dinner. They secure books and
are ready apparently for two or three hours of real
concentration. Within fifteen minutes Miss Student

finds it necessary to walk to the encyclopedia or the
dictionary, while Mr. Student is craving a smoke
already. Five militates out while Miss Student tracks
to the dictionary or visits with a friend who has just
come in, and Mr. Student descends the stairs to the
front of the Library, where he enjoys a cigarette
while telling some other sufferer how hard he has
been studying and how much he has to do before the
Library closes.
These perambulations over, the studious one next
finds that the book selected is not very good. It is
difficult to follow. Another jaunt to the shelves, the
loan desk, or the files to search for something more
comprehensive.
Nine-thirty appears on the face of the clock and
the student decides that he has done enough for one
long evening; so he trudges his weary way home
ward. Yet the University authorities are fearful lest
the students fail to get enough exercise to balance
the fearful mental strain under which they are
laboring.
