Ho Hum!
We wonder if:
There are cactus # gardens—
Five hundred ( s) —
Smoke-ups —
Infant prodigys —
Classified Ads —
Politicians —
And poor geezers who liavp, to write columns
<$> IN OTHER UNIVERSITIES ❖
# # *
Q. The big puzzle is why these despatches are called
"P. I. N. S."
A. There's no point discernable, although all the
heads seem to be present.
it * *
Tuesday also wonders about this Indian raid. Will
Palo Alto be called *he Big Stick after awhile?
• • •
How about Cabbages? It would make it a maize.
Leaving it to anybody's, aren't we read, men. And as
for the mound-building—well?
# * *
Suggestions for yells are in order. As a starter
how's: —
Hooray!
H oo raw!
One-eleven,
Rah!
* * *
All the sport writers should be for it. Think of the
advantages of such words as "war-path, '"scalp v.t.,etc.
* * *
"There," said the Econ prof as he pointed to the un
rolled sock in aisle one, '1s an example cf elastic de
mand."
* # *
As a hint to those who intend to queen Friday night
and whose credit with Belcastro has balanced in a bad
weigh, we suggest turning the tuxedo trousers inside
out for campus wear, at least two days before the big
party, as a sure cure for baggy knees.
# * *
Credit for this encouragement must go to the Cornell
Sun's "Berry Patch."
* * *
There's a mark for some local poet to aim at.

Where have you heard these before?
"She's a knockout."
(To come nearer home) "Well, be good."
"What d'ye know?"
"I hope to tell you."
"No, she hasn't met me yet."
"I'll bite. Where am I going?"
"Hunka fly, Bill."
"I felt like a Nickle."
"Water!"
* * *
"That joke has a thin shell of hdmor."
"Well, throw it in the magazine."
♦ * *
And now we have: —
Famous Bells
Harold ( ) alright
( )e ?
( )-liop that depends
Blue ( ) 90 proof scotch
Liberty ( ) an old crack.
( (t that's a hold-up
Dumb ( ) synonym of No. 1
* * *
Sooner or Later
Why it is now that I tremble no more,
At your very presence as I did before.
I can really appreciate, really admire,
Your rare personality, humor and "fire."
And were I not Godless I'd offer a prayer
That I always may keep the acquired savoir
faire.
That you always may be what you are presently;
Interesting, but—NOT TOO PASSIONATELY.
—PEER US.
* * *
Another good man reclaimed.
* * *
May there be lots of hold-over.
# # *
And now you can turn to the On'n Offs for amuse
ment.

I FEEL JUST LIKE A KID THOUGH I GET THE
MITTEN.

Suggestions for yells are in order. As a starter
