University of California, Berkeley,
Nov. 28. —(P. I. N. S.) —No decision
has yet been arrived at in regard to
the Bruin's opponent at the Pasadena
football game, New Year's Day. The
game will be played at Pasadena but
against whom, no one knows.
However, California does not want
to play any western college. The
Bear eleven defeated the strongest
the mid-west had last year, and want
to try conclusions with a team rep
resentative of the strongest in the
East.
