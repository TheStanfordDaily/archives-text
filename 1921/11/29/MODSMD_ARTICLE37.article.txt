# EDUCATION CLUB WILL BE FORMED TOMORROW
## 
### 
The formation of an Educational
Discussion Club, at whose meetings
students interested in education may
meet and discuss problems of interest
in that line, is to be formed at a meet
ing tomorrow evening of all students
who are in any way interested in the
subject of education. The meeting
will be held in Room 42, at 7:30.
Besides discussion among the mem
bers themselves, it is probable that
the organization will have, from time
to time, speakers who have had out
side experience,to address them. In
this way the interest in the educa
tion department here, will be stimu
lated in a similar manner as that in
other branches of the university by
the various departmental societies.
Tomorrow night's meeting will be
featured by an address by T. W. Mac-
Quarrie, who will talk on "Opportuni
ties in Private Schools." MacQuarrie
was head of a private school in Wis
consin for twelve years before he en
tered the Service, and so has a
thorough knowledge of the subject
which he will discuss. The private
school question is considered by many
as being a vital problem in the edu
cational world today, and what chance
the graduating students interested in
education have of making progress in
their service ewill be one of the phases
of MacQuarrie's talk.
The committee in charge announces
that every student interested in edu
cation is invited to attend this meet
ing.
