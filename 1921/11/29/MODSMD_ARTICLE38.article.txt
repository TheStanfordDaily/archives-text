## 
### 
Among the volumes on the New Book
shelf at the Library this week there arc
three books \khich deal with gardening
and landscaping. "The Art and Craft
of Garden Making," by Thomas H. Maw
son, who is a lecturer on landscape de
sign at the University of Liverpool, dis
cusses the construction of a garden,
from the choice, of the site to finishing
it with pergolas, bridges and statuary.
In "Garden Craft in Europe," H. Inigo
Triggs gives the history of gardening
in each European country from the six
teenth century to modern times. The
illustrations in this volume are taken
from celebrated gardens and palace
parks and from the prints in old books.
A treatment of the esthetic side of
scenery is found in Philip Gilbert Ham
erton's "Landscape." He considers land
scapes as a reflection of the moods of
man and deals with them as they are
found in the "Odyssey," the works of
Virgil. Ariosto, and others. This work
contains reproductions of paintings and
etchings by such men as Turner, Albert
Durer, Joseph Pennell, Corot, and Ti
tian.
