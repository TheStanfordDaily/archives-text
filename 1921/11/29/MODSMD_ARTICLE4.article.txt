Steam up! But the steam was going
up in tjiin air.
We all have our ups and downs, but
yesterday the breaks were against us,
and the thermometer went down. They
sent it around the other end, however,
and now they're casting about for a sub
stitute to plug up the hole in the line.
Getting down to cold facts, as the
snake remarked when he sat on her ice
cream, it was a bad break. The whole
Quad was put in cold storage yesterday
morning when a faulty casting on the
main pipe line gave way and allowed
clouds of steam to rise. The heat was
finally put through the other way on an
emergency connection, and hot air again
ruled supreme.
