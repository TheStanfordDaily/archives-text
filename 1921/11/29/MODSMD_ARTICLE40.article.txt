# OLYMPIC CLUB WILL SEND STRONGEST TEAM
## 
### 
Sid Cavill, swimming coach at the
Olympic Club, is taking no chances
with the Stanford swimming team and
will bring his strongest aggregation
here next Saturday. His strongest ag
gregation means quite a bit, for it is
rated as the best aquatic combination
on the Pacific Coast.
Among those who will invade the
campus next week-end are Lester
Smith, a young title-holder, who makes
phenomenal time in the 220, and Jack
Howell and George Schroth, who are
among the leaders in the 100 yard
breast stroke and back stroke, res
pectively.
Smith appeared on the campus sev
eral weeks ago when he came down
with Lowell High for their meet with
the freshmen. Those who saw him
reel off the 100 yard free style in 57
seconds will attest that he is hard to
beat. The 220 is Smith's special event,
as he is the holder of the 220 na
tional junior title.
Smith isn't so very much faster than
Austin, leader of the Cardinal mer
men, in the 100 yards, for the latter
finished right on his heels when the
two hooked up in the recent dual
meet in San Francisco. In the 220
Smith will have less competition, but
Greppin has been improving fast and
made good time in the Neptune Club
meet.
Cavill will probably enter his stars
in as many events as possible in the
attempt to win by a large scorfe. Smith
is counted on to swim the 100, 220, and
relay, while Schroth will enter the
breast stroke and 100. Besides these
two, the Olympic Club has a number
of experienced men in all the other
events.
The outlook is hardly so rosy for
Coach Brandsten,, He hjas several
men who will push the Olympic stars
hard for first places, but one race is
about all most of them can swim. In
the diving the Cardinal combination
is unbeatable and they should make
a clean sweep of the points.
Fletcher is coming along nicely in
the breast and back strokes. He has
to compete against Howell in the
former, but at that his more experi
enced rival is only about a second
better in time.
