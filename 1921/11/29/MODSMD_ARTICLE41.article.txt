# WOMEN HOCKEY TEAMS BEGIN TOURNAMENTS
## 
### 
Final tournaments for selecting the
women's championship hockey team will
begin this afternoon when the sophomore
women will play the juniors on the
Roble gymnasium held. Owing to fre
quent rains last week the games could
not be played as scheduled.
Taking advantage of the first chance
at practice in over a week, the uppei*-
class and underclass squads went
through stiff work at limbering up for
the tournament today. Although the jun
iors have not entered the intercollegiate
competitions, they have shown them
selves a strong team in all preliminaries,
being defeated with very small scores in
each. The sophomores scored a victory
over California on the 19th, in a game
of noticeably fine teamwork and fast, ac
curate individual play. They held the
Mills freshmen to a tie. the week before.
The success in becoming a champion
ship team depends now upon the. num
ber of tournaments won in the next two
weeks, and the captains arc drilling their
squads daily in efforts at capturing the
titk. The '22 team gained the majority
last year and won the championship with
not a single defeat on its record for the
entire season.
