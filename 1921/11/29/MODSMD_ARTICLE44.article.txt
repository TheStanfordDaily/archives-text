# BASKETBALL TEAMS PLAY FIRST GAMES OF AUTUMN SEASON
## 
### 
A hard-fought basketball contest be
tween Phi Kappa Sigma and El Cuadro
last night served as an excellent curtain
raiser for the intramural basketball sea
son. Phi Kappa Sigma captured the
long end of a 25-22 score. At 8 o'clock
Theta Chi and Sequoia took the floor
and played the second game which re
sulted in an easy victory for the former,
33-11. This morning at 6 o'clock quin
tets representing Theta Xi and Alpha
Kappa Lambda traveled to Encina gym
despite the frosty atmosphere, and
played a good game. A 24-12 victory
went to Alpha Kappa Lambda.
The best court battle was that staged
by Phi Kappa Sigma and El Cuadro. At
the end of the first half the Phi Kappa
Sigma aggregation led by only 1 point,
12 to 11. The teamwork by botTi was
very good for early season playing.
Coulthurst and Thomas were the stars
for Phi Kappa Sigma, the former play
ing forward and the latter center. Dur
ing the last of the game Coulthurst
cinched a victory for his team by throw
ing several neat baskets.
Theta Chi's playing last night showed
that it had a well-balanced team, a large
score being rolled up against Sequoia.
The losing organization evinced a lack
of teamwork which allowed their op
ponents many unnecessary points.
Both Theta Xi and Alpha Kappa
Lambda were on their toes from the
start; short, snappy passing being a no
table feature of the contest. The Theta
Xi men were unable to make their bas
ket shooting count, but played a strong
defensive game.
Tonight at 7 o'clock, Beta Theta Pi
will play El Campo, and at 8 o'clock the
Breakers team will line up against Phi
Delta Theta. Tomorrow morning at 6
o'clock Sequoia third is scheduled to
meet Alpha Chi Sigma. The schedule
tomorrow evening is: At 7 o clock
Sigma Nu vs. Commuters. At 8 o'clock
â€”Phi Gamma Delta vs. Medics.
