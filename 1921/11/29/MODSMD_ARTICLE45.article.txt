# NEW STATUE BY LOCAL SCULPTOR DEDICATED
## 
### 
An artistic memorial statue by A.
Phimister Proctor, campus sculptor,
has recently been dedicated by the
New York Historical Society. Mr.
Proctor made the first sketch of this
statue here in California, three years
ago. It was later taken to his studio
in New York City and there enlarged.
The figure, which is a bronze, repre
sents a stately Indian stooping to
drink from a pool. It is in the Adiron
dack Mountains overlooking Lake
George.
Mr. Proctor left the campus yester
day for New York, where he will spend
the winter completing his equestrian
statue of Colonel Roosevelt which is
to be presented to the City of Port
land.
Mr. Paine, who is taking charge of
Mr. Proctor's studio during his ab
sence, is engaged in enlarging a figure
of "The Circus Rider" which will be
placed on the campus of the state
university at Eugene, Oregon. Mr.
Paine is the man "who invented the
enlarging machine which practically
all sculptors use for making the suc
cessively largel models which char
acterize the growth of a statue from
the original sketch to the completed
work.
