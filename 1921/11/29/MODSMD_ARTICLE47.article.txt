and has tied two. The San Erancisco
Olympic Club is running the Cards a
close second with five games won, one
tied, and one lost.
California slid down to third place
when the Olympics defeated them for
the second time this season. The game
was the clubmen's meat from the very
start, and although it was played on an
exceedingly muddy field, they succeeded
in running up a five to one score on the
Blue and Gold players. California's sin
gle score, came in the second period, a
corner kick making it, possible.
The local American Legion suffered
another defeat when the Barbarians
kicked three goals to the American Le
gion's one. The Legion secured their
only score in the first half. The Bar
barians received all their scores in the
second period when they staged a come
back on the soldiers.
Both sides were handicapped by the
slippery turf and a low fog, which made
it impossible to distinguish players
across the field.
The Stanfoid team did not play its
scheduled game with Italia Virtus Club
due to the poor condition of the turf
and the fact that a good many players
on the varsity were away for the.
Thanksgiving holidays.
