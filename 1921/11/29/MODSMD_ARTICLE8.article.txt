### 
Seat drawing for the sophomore play,
George Bernard Shaw's "You Never Can
Tell," will be held at the Administration
building tomorrow at 1 o'clock. Tickets
will be obtainable at $1 and $1.25. In
addition to these seats, which are avail
able for students and the community at
large, a special block of seats has been
reserved for faculty members. These
may be procured at the Associated Stu
dents' Office in the balcony of the Ad
ministration building, or may be re
served by phoning Local 134. These
seats will be held for faculty members
until two days before the play.
Responsibility for one of the vital ele
ments of comedy in "You Never Can
Tell," rests on the heads of a pair of
twins, Dolly and Phillip Clandon, played
by Helen Whitney and John Vaughan,
who romp through the play with a spon
tane.nous spirit of deviltry which even
the gruff sputterings of the irrascible
Mr. McComas (Daniel Gage) or the
vigorous protestations of their newly
discovered parent (John Richer) arc
powerless to subdue.
Having spent the entirety of their re
spective eighteen years in an island re
treat in the Mediterranean, and edu
cated along the most highly advanced
lines of modern twentieth century
thought, the pair are the incarnation of
youthful savagery. Conventions and the
ways of select English life are nothing
to these young barbarians, who proceed
to adopt as their father one William, a
waiter at their sea-side hotel.
William, played by Samuel Menden-
Ha.ll. is one of Shaw's best loved char
acters. He is a man of many surprises
—a kindly, affable, benevolent old gen
tleman, who immediately inspires per
fect trust and confidence. His direct
opposite is his son, an eminent barrister
—not bartender—he is ejiger to explain.
This son, Bohttn, taken bv David Man
noccir. enters later in the play to clear
up certain difficulties arising in the
Compton household. Thereto hangs an
other tale in the developments of "You
Never Can Tell."
