# FIFTY MEN OUT FOR FIRST PRACTICE OF BABE COURT SEASON
## 
### 
Freshman basketball practice started
yesterday afternoon with about tifty of
the lirst-year men on the court. Coach
Scay put them through some basket
shooting practice and, while the candi
dates displayed their prep school skill at
piercing the magic circle, he took a line
on the material at hand.
Freshman gridmen who donned the
trunks and jerseys yesterday were
Wheat, Hooper, Sliipke, Macrorie, and
Harris. In basketball regalia, the husky
Sliipke stands out as the Roman gladia
tor type and his appearance on the court
is not unlike that of "Swede" Righter,
varsity star who was a strong factor in
the Cardinal success of the past two
years.
Coach Seay hopes to have seventy
five candidates'by the end of the quarter,
and he announces that there will be no
cut in the squad until then. The first
game, scheduled with Mountain View
High, will be. played here January 7,
and this leaves plenty of time for all
promising material to be uncovered.
For the rest of this quarter freshman
practice will begin at 3:30, the varsity
coming on the court at 5 o'clock. It
will be five times a week, and all candi
dates are expected to be present at every
practice.
