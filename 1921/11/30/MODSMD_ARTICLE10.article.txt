# Stanford to Compete in Coast Conference Swim
## 
### 
Corvallis, Oregon, will be the scene
of the Pacific Coast Conference swim
ming meet, the banner event of the- year
in the intercollegiate aquatic world, in
the early part of 1922. The Oregon Ag
ricultural College will play host for the
first time to teams from most of the in
stitutions of the Coast.
Although no official action has yet
been taken, it is more than probable
that a group of Cardinal swimmers will
be sent north for the event. Stanford's
well-balanced team should have, an ex
cellent chance of winning the Pacific
Coast Conference championship, even
with Pinkston ineligible for intercol
legiate competition.
Reports from the north indicate that
although swimming is as yet in its in
fancy as a recognized sport at O. A. C.,
its popularity is second only to that of
football. There are more candidates out
for the team than can easily be taken
care of, and there is some sentiment al
ready for recognizing it as a major
sport.
Swimming Manager Schmeider has
received several offers from the Los An
geles Athletic Club relative to a meet
with the Stanford swimmers in the
spring. The outlook at present seems
to point toward a southern invasion by
Brandsten's charges in the spring vaca
tion.
The fact that most of the important
swimming events occur in the winter and
spring, works a hardship on Coach
Brandstcn. Many of the swimmers arc
now engaged in other activities and are
not in their best condition.
