# J. STITT WILSON TO SPEAK AT STANFORD
## Former Socialist and Nationwide Speaker Will Address Students and Community 
### 
J. Stitt Wilson, best-known of na
tion-wide speakers, will be presented
before Stanford University and the
people of Palo Alto in a series of talks
according to an announcement made
yesterday.
January 8, 9, 10, and 11, are the
dates which have been set aside for
Wilson's speeches. The first day of
his visit, Sunday, he will talk in the
Memorial Church, and during the three
days following, the Assembly Hall will
be provided to hold the crowds that
are expected.
Wilson came into prominence over a
decade ago when, as a member of the
Socialist party, he figured prominently
in the political circle of Berkeley. He
was elected mayor of Berkeley on the
Socialist ticket in 1910, and his meth
ods of governing the city and giving
it an enviable administration caused
his name to become well-known over
many sections of the country.
After an interval of eight years,
there came a time when Wilson broke
with his party, explaining that he was
entirely out of sympathy with the Bol
shevistic spirit that seemed to control
the organization after the war was
ended and the revolution in Russia
had gained full sway. He has never
since rejoined the party.
During the last two years, Wilson
has spent his entire time speaking in
many different colleges throughout the
country. He has made an extensive
tour of the east and middle-west, ad
dressing the students and faculty on
important issues of the day. He has
been working under the International
Committee of the Y. M. C. A., under
whose auspices he is coming to Stan
ford.
When the war was at its height, and
the camps of the country were filled
with newly recruited soldiers, W'ilson
spoke continuously before the soldi
ers, at the behest of the authorities;
and his speeches gained prominence
throughout the country. He has been
the chief speaker at various student
conventions in the United States, and
has been in demand by such organiza
tions as the Red Cross, the Chambers
of Commerce, and the Rotary Clubs of
the cities he has visited.
