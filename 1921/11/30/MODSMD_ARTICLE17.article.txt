# HERTZ CONCERT OPENS STANFORD MUSICAL SEASON
## Symphony Orchestra Players Present Artistic Numbers In Assembly Hall Program 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
To hear a program prepared and
directed by Alfred Hertz is to hear
music not only read with technical
precision as to score but interpreted
with the supreme artistry of a master.
The eighty-five members of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra are a
group of perfectly trained musicians,
responding with instant accord to the
slightest whim or most vigorous de
mand of the master magician.
The opening concert of the Sym
phony Orchestra last evening was an
occasion for grateful appreciation on
the part of those who have heard the
notable organization before, and an
inspiring experience to those previ
ously unfamiliar with the achieve
ments of Alfred Hertz. Each number
was received with immediate response
and it was difficult to center interest
on any particular selection, so ideally
balanced and variously appealing was
the program.
The opening number, however, Dvo
rak's "New World Symphony," with
its four movements, each in a differ
ent mood, the "Adagio," "Largo,"
"Scherzo," and "Finale," possibly at
tained the farthest heights in the even
ing's program, combining as it does
high lights and somber shadows, deli
cate rythms and intense volleys of
sound —a wide range of emotional ex
pression revealing clearly the very es
sence of the symphony. Dvorak has
caught the true spirit of "new world"
music and has woven it into a series of
themes beautifully appealing and
combined with perfect orchestration.
Dukas' "The Scorcerer's Appren
tice," full of delightful imagery was
interpreted with a keen appreciation
of its whimsical nature. Intensely
pictorial, one could follow step by step
the mischievous young apprentice, as
he tip-toed about, chanting the charm
he had learned from his master.
When the broom which he had en
chanted began to carry water, one was
completely captivated by the spirit of
the piece, could hear the swish and
swirl of the water and was in abso
lute sympathy with the predicament
of the poor young apprentice; could
breathe with him a true sigh of relief
when his cry for help brought relief
at the crucial moment. It was an in
triguing piece, full of rythmic charm
and delightful melody, played with
captivating spontaneity.
An unusual number was "A Sketch
of the Steppes of Central Asia," by
Borodin. The movement was full of
rich oriental strains, and was inter
preted with a certain impressive re
straint which emphasized its desert
atmosphere and was picturesquely
suggestive of Arabian Nights legends.
Weltzer's Overture to "As You Like
It" was an interesting composition in
volving vigorous bursts of tone and
delicate romantic suggestion. It is fill
ed with captivating conceits and fan
cies, moving and ingenious, and the
various characters of the drama to,
which it is an introduction are de
picted with engrossing precision. It
formed a most satisfying close to a
unique program.

inspiring experience to those previ
ously unfamiliar with the achieve
ments of Alfred Hertz. Each number
was received with immediate response
and it was difficult to center interest
on any particular selection, so ideally
balanced and variously appealing was
the program.
The opening number, however, Dvo
rak's "New World Symphony," with
its four movements, each in a differ
ent mood, the "Adagio," "Largo,"
"Scherzo," and "Finale," possibly at
tained the farthest heights in the even
ing's program, combining as it does
high lights and somber shadows, deli
cate rythms and intense volleys of
sound —a wide range of emotional ex
pression revealing clearly the very es
sence of the symphony. Dvorak has
caught the true spirit of "new world"
music and has woven it into a series of
themes beautifully appealing and
combined with perfect orchestration.
Dukas' "The Scorcerer's Appren
tice," full of delightful imagery was
interpreted with a keen appreciation
of its whimsical nature. Intensely
pictorial, one could follow step by step
the mischievous young apprentice, as
he tip-toed about, chanting the charm
he had learned from his master.
When the broom which he had en
chanted began to carry water, one was
completely captivated by the spirit of
the piece, could hear the swish and
swirl of the water and was in abso
lute sympathy with the predicament
of the poor young apprentice; could
breathe with him a true sigh of relief
when his cry for help brought relief
at the crucial moment. It was an in
triguing piece, full of rythmic charm
and delightful melody, played with
captivating spontaneity.
An unusual number was "A Sketch
of the Steppes of Central Asia," by
Borodin. The movement was full of
rich oriental strains, and was inter
preted with a certain impressive re
straint which emphasized its desert
atmosphere and was picturesquely
suggestive of Arabian Nights legends.
Weltzer's Overture to "As You Like
It" was an interesting composition in
volving vigorous bursts of tone and
delicate romantic suggestion. It is fill
ed with captivating conceits and fan
cies, moving and ingenious, and the
various characters of the drama to,
which it is an introduction are de
picted with engrossing precision. It
formed a most satisfying close to a
unique program.
To hear a program prepared and
directed by Alfred Hertz is to hear
music not only read with technical
precision as to score but interpreted
with the supreme artistry of a master.
The eighty-five members of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra are a
group of perfectly trained musicians,
responding with instant accord to the
slightest whim or most vigorous de
mand of the master magician.
The opening concert of the Sym
phony Orchestra last evening was an
occasion for grateful appreciation on
the part of those who have heard the
notable organization before, and an
inspiring experience to those previ
