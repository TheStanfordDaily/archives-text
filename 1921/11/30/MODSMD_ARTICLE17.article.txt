# HERTZ CONCERT OPENS STANFORD MUSICAL SEASON
## Symphony Orchestra Players Present Artistic Numbers In Assembly Hall Program 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
To hear a program prepared and
directed by Alfred Hertz is to hear

occasion for grateful appreciation on
the part of those who have heard the

music and has woven it into a series of
themes beautifully appealing and
combined with perfect orchestration.
Dukas' "The Scorcerer's Appren
tice," full of delightful imagery was
interpreted with a keen appreciation
of its whimsical nature. Intensely
pictorial, one could follow step by step
