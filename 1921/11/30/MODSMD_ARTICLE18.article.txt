# HANDBALL SQUAD IS PRACTICALLY CHOSEN FOR BRUIN CONTEST
## 
### 
Stanford's representatives in the
handball tournament with the Uni
versity of California next Saturday,
on the Berkeley Y. M. C. A. box courts
have practically been selected. Try
outs have been held every afternoon
on the box courts of the Peninsula
Club in Palo Alto.
Many of the candidates have had
experience on the single face type of
court only, and this has eliminated
them from cosideration. Fletcher, Col
vin and Sidway, are among those who
are not at home on the box courts.
The singles candidates have been
narrowed down to three, and possibly
four, men as a result of the tryouts.
Lowenstein, on account of his win
over his California opponent last year,
is the favorite for one of the positions.
In the other singles either Koba or
Rutter will represent the Cardinal.
Mark Cohen may decide to play sing
les, and that will make four capable
performers.
Stanford's chances in the doubles
will be handicapped somewhat by the
absence of Reticker, who was forced
to take out a leave of absence. Re
ticker and his team-mate, Rutter,
were figured to form one of*the two
doubles teams. Mark Cohen and
Aaron Cohen may form one of the
teams, and for the other pair there
are Sansone and Landweer.
Members of the faculty are the lat
est recruits to the ranks of handball
enthusiasts. An entry list has been
opened for a faculty handball tour
nament in which every member of the
teaching staff is eligible to take part.
