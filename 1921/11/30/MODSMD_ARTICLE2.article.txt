Athletic Director Walter Powell has
announced that interclass wrestling
tournament lias been inaugurated, which
will begin today at 4 p. m., and will be
continued 011 Friday and on the follow
ing Monday. Great interest is being
displayed in this branch of the minor
sports this year, according to both
Powell and Hosepian, the wrestling in
structor, and a lively tournament is an
ticipated.
While the lighter weights are well
represented, there is need for more
heavyweights, and it is hoped that with
the close of the football season some
heavy wrestlers will turn out. Instruc
tor Hosepian makes the statement that
everyone in any of the four University
classes is eligible for participation in
this tournament, and that it is not merely
confined to those men taking wrestling
at the present time.
The juniors are figured to have an
edge on the tournament, as they have
a good turnout of thoroughly expe
rienced men, among whom are D. John
son, Hosepian, Lane and Smith. Proc
tor and Bailard for the sophomores are
expected to put up a stiff fight for their
cla-s. Among the seniors, Mercer and
Baer have the best chance of coming
through with a win for their class. Mc-
Kree, Londrell and Pallette fox the
freshmen have shown up well in prac
tice this year, and may spring some sur
prises.
