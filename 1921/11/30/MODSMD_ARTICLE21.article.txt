# Cutting Out Cutouts
## 
### 
Sentiment against the student with the automobile
is always appearing in one place or another around
the campus. Sometimes it is on hearsay about what
the powers that be are going - to do with regard to
the moneyed youth who sports about in his racer,
and then it comes again when some particular act
of indiscretion has been committed by a member of
the student body in connection with an auto.
There is one thing that stands out plainly, how
ever, when the operation of a machine is a distinct
nuisance to everyone on the campus who hears the
passage of an offender. This is running in the
night with the cutout open. The University has
rules against this just as it has speed regula
tions on the campus. They are the same as those
existing in any closely built-up community, and the
difference here is that they are less rigidly en
forced than in a municipality due, perhaps, to the
kindheartedness of the University officials in regard
to the vagaries of the—"well, he's a student." One
thought of the trouble and annoyance that is caused
by a burst of speed up the side of the.Quad past the
library in the evening, when several hundred people
are trying to study in the library, or by the dormi
tories or houses of the living group, will make
anyone realize that a roar going up the street will
detract the attention of most of those who are trying
to get their work done for the evening.
This is not mere thoughtlessness in a good many
cases. There are among* the student body members
who take a delight in demonstrating the "bark" of
their motors to the suffering dwellers. Every time
one of these comes up the street he causes annoy
ance to many, and a conviction in the minds of
some that the auto is a bad thing for the college
man to have on the campus. We, as a unit can, by
a word to those who are making the noise, put them
right at the time, and then the authorities can and
will set the lid on them for good if they don't take
the hint and stop making the disturbance.-W. C. E.
