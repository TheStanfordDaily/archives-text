# Intramural Athletics
## 
### 
A score or more of organizations are battling
this week and will continue to fight for the next
month or so to determine which is the strongest
and can take more falls out of the others in the race
for the title to the University basketball trophy.
Spirit is running high in all groups and each one is
backing its entry with all the enthusiasm that ac
companies a varsity game, in many cases there is
more of down-right interest because the men who
play on the various teams are right from the groups
to which the rooters belong.
Intramural athletics bring out varsity material
that otherwise might not feel the urge to try for a
berth on a varsity or freshman team. Also, the ath
letic interest of non-participating- members of the
group is kept up and the habit of going to the gym
nasiufti is more solidly formed. Besides, intramural
sports furnish exercise for the big percentage of
the masculine members of the student body who
would not otherwise indulge, and is the thing
at which the instigators of the system aimed.
Healthful exercise is the best tonic for keeping
the mind open so that when the brain is given its
workout at the study table it may grasp the prob
lems which are put before it. The strenuous phys
ical effort that is put into a hard-fought game of
rough and tumble sport is given with a will, and as
such it is a great spirit-builder. If it were given in
some compulsory system of calisthenics it would
work harm. Thus, the benefits of intramural sports
are heightened by the interest born of close associa
tion both of the players and the supporters on the
sidelines.

MANY UNSIGNED COMMUNICATIONS come
to the Daily Palo Alto in the course of each week.
It should be known by now that these cannot be
published unless they are matters of news interest.
Most of them are student expressions of ideas about
the University, or about an activity that the writer

thinks is not being conducted properly. Most of
them are real works of art in the line of composi
tion, but they cannot be published without the iden
tity of the writer being known to the editor of the
Daily.
The only need for knowing the identity of the
communicant is to safeguard the paper in publish
ing opinions of a prejudiced nature. Any nom de
plume may be signed for publication, but it is neces
sary that the name of the writer should be known to
the editor.
If this is done most of the viewpoints may be
published unless they are of such type as to be of
interest only to a restricted number of readers, in
which case the right to publish them is reserved.
