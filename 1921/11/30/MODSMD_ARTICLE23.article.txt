"Kissing, like psychology, is a science of the mind,
instincts and emotions," declares Floribel Foureyes, in
structor in psychology. "To make it more scientific,
however, one must go through a process of elimination,
made most effective by prolonged experimentation."

The Last Straw
"It makes me mad," the co-ed said, "the way some
people do.
They're never satisfied with things, but always fuss and
stew,
They tell us how to eat, and sleep, and walk, and even
talk,
But there's one thing we can't be told, the place where
women balk,
Artistic kisses are all right, in any movie plot
BUT WE REFUSE TO THINK OF ART, OUT
SIDE THE MOVIE LOT.
If education's needed, you can give it to the men,
I know of some who'd like advice, on how, and where,
and when,
But let me tell you one thing—that the good old
fashioned way,
While maybe not artistic, is the best one, any day.

KISMET!
