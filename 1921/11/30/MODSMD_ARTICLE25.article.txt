"The Little Man With One Shoe," by
Margery Bailey. Boston: Little, Brown
& Company:
I flatter myself that I am a not al
together incompetent person to review
a hook of stories for children, for these
reasons: 1 was once a child myself, I
have a number of children of my own,
and in my time I have written several
children's tales. There is only one dis
qualification which concerns the present
volume, and that is that Miss Bailey is
a good friend of mine, as of all of us
at Stanford, and my conscience, there
fore, forbids my writing anything as
flattering to her work (because too much
praise may not be, good for her) as her
book would tempt me to do otherwise.
This is the second of her collection of
tales for small folks, the publisher hav
ing been, like the rest of us, so well
pleased with the first volume, "Seven
Peas in a Pod," that he clamored for
more. Like the stories in that group,
these told by the "Little Man With One

Shoe," combine in a very unusual way
the simple elements of effective narra
tive, which must be the basis of suc
cess for young readers, with subtlety
and distinction of style. To some ex
tent this combination is due to the
writer's familiarity with medieval ro
mance, the great store-house and stand
ard of fiction which deals with beauty
and wonder, and in particular to that of
the Irish, who have a finer natural sense
of style than any other modern people.
But while Miss Bailey has imitated, and
very wisely, lore of this sort, her method
is in a number of ways charmingly orig
inal. She has quaint philosophy and hu
mor to spare—some of her child read
ers and not a little of the sort that
passes lightly over their heads to please

their elders. "In a house where there
is the beauty of sunrise, and the wisdom
of sunset, and the patience of life, and
the faithfulness of death—and a baby,
too —why, there is nothing lacking at
all." Some might wish to simplify this
sort of thing, or to expurgate it, for
small listeners; but I fancy that Miss
Bailey is one who believes that children
should learn to listen to what they will
understand only hereafter, blended with
what they grasp at the moment. There
is much to be said for that principle.
Anyhow, I have tested this book with
an audience of big folks and little folks
mixed, and it worked with us all.
Therefore it is a jolly good Christmas
gift for a whole household.

and wonder, and in particular to that of
the Irish, who have a finer natural sense
of style than any other modern people.
But while Miss Bailey has imitated, and
very wisely, lore of this sort, her method
is in a number of ways charmingly orig
inal. She has quaint philosophy and hu
mor to spare—some of her child read
ers and not a little of the sort that
passes lightly over their heads to please

their elders. "In a house where there
is the beauty of sunrise, and the wisdom
of sunset, and the patience of life, and
the faithfulness of death—and a baby,
too —why, there is nothing lacking at
all." Some might wish to simplify this
sort of thing, or to expurgate it, for
small listeners; but I fancy that Miss
Bailey is one who believes that children
should learn to listen to what they will
understand only hereafter, blended with
what they grasp at the moment. There
is much to be said for that principle.
Anyhow, I have tested this book with
an audience of big folks and little folks
mixed, and it worked with us all.
Therefore it is a jolly good Christmas
gift for a whole household.
