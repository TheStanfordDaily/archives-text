## DAILY CALIFORNIAN TRIES PRINTING NEWS OF OUTSIDE 
### 
Berkeley, Nov. 30. —(P. I. N. S.) —
A column headed "Significant Eventa
of World's News" has been added to
the front page of the Daily Californi
an, the student newspaper of the Uni
versity of California. It is composed
of the important events of the day,
which are presented in tabloid form.
Many students, it is thought, are
too much absorbed in University pur
suits for a careful reading of the
world's affairs each day. As the Daily
Californian reaches practically every
one in the University, the students
will get the news of real significance.
