# W. A. A. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE APPROVED BY BOARD
## 
### 
Regulations for the eligibility of
women to enter athletic competitions
which were drawn up by the Eligi
bility Committee of the W. A. A. were
approved by the faculty board and
returned to the Association in a meet
ing held last evening in the Women's
clubhouse. The W. A. A. wants all
women to notice the requirements so
that there will be no misunderstanding
when registering for work on teams
next quarter. They stand as follows:
A student shall be eligible to play
on the class team corresponding to the
academic year on which she enters the
University. The summer quarter shall
be considered as belonging to the fol
lowing rather than the preceding aca
demic year.
Students transferring from other in
stitutions shall be granted the stand
ing on athletic teams corresponding
to the academic standing for which
they apply at the Registrar's office.
Provided that: A student shall par
ticipate one quarter only in a given
sport witk a given class, except that
graduates shall be eligible for Senior
teams. This is understood to apply
to sports having only one season in
a given year.
An advanced class in tennis will be
offered next quarter to facilitate the
organization of material for competi
tions in the spring quarter. Only
women who enter this class will be
eligible for teams. Arrangements will
be made so that Juniors and Seniors
can enter into practice for both tennis
and basketball teams. Due to the com
pulsory course on theory gymnasium,
the underclass women will be handi
capped making it practically impos
sible to enter both sports.
Preliminary arrangements are be
ing made for the Pacific Coast W. A.
A. conference which will be held in
Eugene, Oregon. Stanford will be the
treasurer at the session.
