There are several examples of very
early American school textbooks on the
library's New Book shelf this week.
The oldest of these is a copy of "The
American Spelling Book," by Noah
Webster, which was printed in 1783.
Thin, wooden laths form its binding.
This volume, generally known as "The
Old Blueback Speller," was still in use
in some of the southern states until ten
years ago, and at the present time is
brought out for spelling matches held
in the schools of those states. The book
was presented to the library by Mrs.
I. S. Oldroyd.
"The Scholar's Guide, to Arithmetic,"
published in 1819 by Phinenas Merrill,
is another of these books. Besides the
usual subdivisions of arithmetic, it has
sections given to barter, tare and trett,
fellowship, alligation, and vulgar frac
tions.
"A Grammar .of the English Lan
guage," in a series of letters, written in
1818, by William Corbett, has the state
ment on the. title page that it is intended
for use in schools, "but more especially
for the use of soldiers, sailors, appren
tices and plough boys." Another gram
mar of the period which is with this
collection is "Conversations on English
Grammar," 1821, by Charles M. Inger
soll.
