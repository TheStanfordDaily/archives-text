# $1,000 SUBSCRIBED IN RED CROSS CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
With reports from Encina not yet in,
the totals for the Red Cross drive, held
on the campus last week, have reached
$1,000. This amount includes money
collected from students, faculty and all
other campus residents.
Although the response to the roll call
was far from 100 per cent, there were,
more subscriptions this year than ever
before. Professor Fairclough, who is
the Stanford representative to the Palo
Alto Red Cross chapter, expressed him
self as being very well pleased with the
results of the campaign.
