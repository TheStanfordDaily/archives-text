# THREE FAST COURT GAMES PLAYED BY INTRAMURAL TEAMS
## 
### 
El Campo, Phi Delta Tlicta, and the
Japanese Club emerged as victors in the
intramural basketball contests held last
evening and this morning.
El Campo's quintet won by three
points over Beta Tlicta Pi, the final
score being 9 to 6. The game was close,
El Campo leading 2 to 1. Cunningham
and Larson piled up the necessary points
in the last part of the second half. The
Beta aggregation made three shifts of
teams, in a vain attempt to find the win
ning combination. Dole, of the loosers,
looked very good in action. Lack of ac
curacy, not lack of shooting for baskets,
was responsible for the low scores by
both teams.
The first half of the Phi Delta Theta-
Breakcrs' contest was almost an even
break at 5-2. In the next period the
Piggott, Fletcher, Logan combination
developed a high-class brand of team
work, and dropped the'ball through the
net consistently, the final score, being 21
to 8. These three tall players showed
rather conclusively that playing the ball
instead of the man produces winning
results. Rapid passing and short shots
were characteristic. The Phi Delta The
ta forwards were much aided by the
efficient guarding of the O'Hara broth
ers. The victors seem to have plenty
scintillating stars and claim to be out
after the. intramural bacon. Last year
they were defeated in the finals by Al
pha Delta Phi.
The 6 o'clock game this morning was
played by the Japanese Club and Alpha
Chi Sigma, and ended in a goose-egg
defeat for the chemistry majors, 28 to 0.
The Japanese players far outclassed
"Swede" Larson's proteges. Coach-Lar
son appeared in the last half 'but was
unable to discover the right formula for
the chemistry wizards. Koba, last year's
flee.t-footed forward on the 135-pound
team, threw live baskets for the Japa
nese quintet. His good work was nearly
equalled by that of Kitow, Mizota, and
Murata, who divided up a total of eight
more baskets.
Tonight at 7 o'clock Sigma Nu will
play the Commuters, and at 8 o'clock
Phi Gamma Delta is scheduled to play
El Toro.
