# UNIQUE STAGE SETTINGS TO BE FEATURE OF PLAY
## 
### 
Sets representing the most recent ten
dencies in stagecraft will be. used a> the
background for the various acts of "You
Never Can Tell." Scenic arrangements
are under the direction of Chrysilla
Dunker, C. E. Coakley, and A. E. Cur
tis, and some novel effects have been
planned, carrying out the latest ap
proved theories of modern stage art.
The setting of the second act will be.
particularly striking. In constructing
the scenery for this act the new model
stage, a recent innovation in Gordon
Davis' "Green Room" was used. The
miniature theater is an exact reproduc
tion of the Assembly Hall stage, and
scenery and furniture were designed in
detail to fit this stage, before the work
of actual execution was begun.
The set represents the exterior and
terrace of an English seaside resort.
On one side is a high wall with a heavy
gate of typical English design. Opposite
this is the hotel, with a wide square
flagged platform. In the background is
a parapet of jar pilasters supporting a
broad stone coping on the outer edge.
This parapet stands up over the sea like
a cliff, and suggests vistas of sea stretch
ing beyond. The center of the stage
represents the hotel terrace.
Another effective scene will be that of
the third act, the sitting room of the
Clandon's apartment in the hotel. This
has been developed in the very latest
color schemes and represents the usual
kind of expensive apartment, with im
pressive furnishings usually found in the
guest suite of a modern summer hotel.
In the fourth act this set becomes more

striking. The scene is the same. When
the curtain rises, a costume ball is in
progress in another room of the hotel.
It is 9 o'clock. Lamps are lighted. The
French windows at the back of Clandon's
apartment stand wide opeji, and strings
of Chinese lanters are glowing among
the trees outside, with the starry sky
beyond. The band is playing dance mu
sic in the garden, drowning the sound of
the sea, and from time to time dancers
in costume saunter in from the masque
ball.
The setting for the opening act is the.
result of much ingenuity. It is the newly
equipped operating room of an aspiring
young dentist. Complete dental equip
ment, including the revolving chair, cab
inets of instruments, and laughing
apparatus have been secured. The scene
will be complete even unto a bright, new
diploma hanging on a conspicuous wall.
The furnishings are those associated
with the. profession—wall paper de
signed with the taste of an undertaker,
in festoons and urns, carpet with its
symmetrical plans of rich cabbagy nose
gays—ornamental glass chandeliers, a
generous scattering of ornamental gilt
on furniture and mantel, the fireplace
of black marble, vaguely suggestive of
the family vault. In a word, the set will
create immediately the atmosphere of
the "dental parlor" of the typical small
town. •
A preliminary dress rehearsal for the
play will take place tonight. The seat
sale for the performance opened today
at Crandall's Book Store in Palo Alto
and at the box office in the Administra
tion building.
