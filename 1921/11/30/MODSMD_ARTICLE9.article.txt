# IMPRESSONISTIC DESIGNS TO PREVAIL AT COTILLION
## 
### 
Impressionism will feature the
Sophomore cotillion, December 2. It
will pervade the atmosphere, regulate
the lights, characterize the drapery
and guide the design of the program.
Color, life, brilliance in splotches,
streaks and kaledioscopic jumbles will
crop up apparently without plan in
the cotillion decorations, says Chair
man John Richer.
* The programs will be something en
tirely new in the line of partner in
dices according to Robert Nourse who
is attending to them. The cover will
be hand-painted. Quad arches, palms,
soph hats, perhaps a bit of cactus, a
co-ed or two and the class numerals,
together with other characteristic
tokens of Stanford are pictured in a
seemingly aimless design on the front.
The inside pages will be engraved in
stead of printed with the titles of the
dances. The back of the program will
be covered with black striped figure
and the whole thing will be bound
together with a black cord. To every
woman's program-cord will be attached
a small ivory favor.
East Indian spirit will prove the

keynote to the decorations themselves.
Orange, yellow and violet are the
chief colors whcih will be used. Stripes
of the bright colors will run the length
of the gymnasium, doming over in a
large arch from one side of the floor
to the other and giving a larger ap
pearance to the hall. The retreats
between the girders will be draped in
deep violet and discreetly lighted.
Here and there, indiscriminate bits of
color will break into the scheme carry
ing out the impressionistic idea.
Ernest Greppin who has arranged
the decorations and lights says that
he is going to attempt something new
with the lights for the cotillion. A
man will be managing the dimmers on
all the spots throughout the dance,
regulating the intensity of the lights
and blending them in a way that will
reflect the spirit of the dance, be it
slow, dreamy, light, spirited, or the
like.
The lights will not be directly beam
ing on the floor but will illuminate by
reflection. When it falls upon the de
corations the light will be diffused and
easily blended into the effects which
Greppin hopes to obtain.
