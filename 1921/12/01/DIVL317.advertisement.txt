How do they get that way?
ASK the man with the big income his "secret of
jf\ success," and you will generally find that it is
some copy-book maxim known to everybody.
"Jse sure you are right, then go ahead."
"It* anything is in your way, go over it."
"Learn something about everything and every
thing about something."
Trite! Anybody could give you as good advice.
It simply means that success is not a problem of
discovering some obscure short-cut. The path is
plain enough, but only alertness, energy and self
discipline will push you along it.
All this holds a special force for you because
what you do at college will influence what you do
afterwards. If you start right, the chances are you
will finisji right.
You can begin now to earn your place in the high
salaried class. Each honest day's work in laboratory
and lecture hall will bring you nearer. It will help
tyou to master the fundamentals of your profession
â€”so that later on you may handle problems more
easily and make decisions more quickly and surely.
Then and only then, in proportion as you clear
your mind of detail, can you give time and energy
to those larger questions of policy in engineering,
selling, management and finance, which fix the execu
tive's market value.
