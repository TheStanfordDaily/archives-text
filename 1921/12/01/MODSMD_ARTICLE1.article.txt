# PROFESSOR WING GIVES FUND FOR CIVIL ENGINEERS

Professor C. B. Wing, head of the
Department of Civil Engineering, and
designer of the Stanford stadium, will
create a fund to help pay for the educa
tion of civil engineering students at
Stanford with the fee which the Board
of Athletic Control desired to pay him
for his expert services. The fund will
amount to more than $3,000.
This was determined at a meeting of
the Board of Athletic Control last night.
At the time the Board requested Pro
fessor Wing to aid it in securing plans
for the stadium, their idea was that he
would receive the usual fee for such
services, which is ordinarily two per cent
of the cost of the structure. Professor
Wing, however, declined to accept any
fee, preferring to contribute his time
and skill, as a Stanford man, to the en
terprise.
Recently the Board, feeling under spe
cial obligations to Professor Wing,
since the. method of construction which
he devised and which is a new idea in
such undertakings, had made it possible
to build the stadium at the surprisingly
low cost of $210,000, brought the sub
ject up again in a more insistent way,
with the final agreement between it and
Professor Wing that his contribution
should be regarded in the same light as
other gifts to the stadium project, and
that the money value of his expert serv
ices be withdrawn from the gate re
ceipts of the stadium, and as with all
other contributions devoted to some
University purpose, according to the
choice of the donor.
Professor Wing has chosen to have
the amount of his fee added to the
scholarship fund of the Stanford Stu
dent Chapter of the American Associa
tion of Civil Engineers.
