# CHEMISTRY CLUB TO EXHIBIT FILMS ON EXPLOSIVES TONIGHT
## 
### 
The manufacture of dynamite, zinc
oxide, and the smelting of iron will be
shown in moving pictures at the Little
Theater this evening at 7:30. The pic
tures were produced under the direc
tion of the Bureau of Mines of the
United States government, and have
been secured by the Chemistry Club, un
der whose auspices the meeting is to be
held. As the pictures are shown, Pro
fessor W. J. Crook, Dr. Franklin, and
Professor N. W. Rakestraw will explain
the processes.
The pictures will begin with the very
elementary steps in making dynamite,
and will carry it through to where the
finished product is placed on the mar
ket. These pictures will be of special in
terest to engineering, chemistry, and
geology majors. The films have been
produced so that they are of interest to
people who have had very little training
along chemical lines of study. This
meeting is open to anyone who desires
to attend. The Chemistry Club plans to
have events of a similar nature next
quarter.
