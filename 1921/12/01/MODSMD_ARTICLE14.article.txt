# SHORTAGE OF CLOTH PREVENTS COTILLION DECORATION SCHEME
## 
### 
Rube Goldberg will be out of a job
yet!
If the cotillion decorations get any
more impressionistic there will :be
no more chance for competitibn. The
plan is overshadowed. The latest
dream is guaranteed by the official
decorator to puzzle even Freud.
It was calculated that it would take
1300 yards of twenty-seven inch muslin
to form the canopy of yellow and
orange which was planned. But as the
yards began to accumulate, the neces
sary amount stopped far short of the
requirement. Whereupon the first
idea is slain and the distress signal
is hung upon the door of a theatrical
supply house and their stock-rooms the
final scheme is born.
It will take just as many men to
arrange the new decorations as the
old, however, and the call for all sopho
mores to report at the gymnasium at
7:00 o'clock tonight, still holds, ac
cording to John Richer, chairman of
the cotillion committee.
