# PENINSULA MUM SERIES OPENS WITH CONCERT NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The Peninsula Musical Association
will open its series of concerts for the
present season next Tuesday evening,
December 6, in the Assembly Hall, when
a combination violin and piano program
will be presented by two young Rus
sian artists, whose names are probably
unfamiliar to most western music-lov
ers, Mishel Piastro and Alfred Miro
vitch.
Piastro has been heralded and praised
by his great confrers of the violin, Hei
fetz, Kreisler, Zimbalist, and Ysaye, as
the best of the younger generation of
violinists, and by far the most promis
ing of the great crop of European art
ists that invaded New York last season.
His sterling artistry has established him
already in this country as one of the
significant musicians, on .his showing
made in New York and other eastern
cities last year.
Alfred Mirovitch, a cousin of Ossip
Gabrilowitsch, the famous Russian pia
nist now acting as conductor of the De
troit Symphony, shares the native talent
of a distinguished family. In his piano
programs, Mirovitch has shown a keen
perception of the inner meaning of mod
ern composition, with especial talent for
interpretation of the modern Russian
school. Cortot, the celebrated French
virtuoso, said in San Francisco last year
that he considered Alfred Mirovitch "an
artist to his linger-tips."
A limited number of season tickets
for the Peninsula course still remain,
and some single reserved seats are also
on sale at Crandall's Book Store in Palo
Alto.
