# OLYMPIC CLUB CALLS OFF STANFORD MEET
## 
### 
Olympic Club swimming stars will
not meet the Stanford varsity aggrega
tion in the return match at the Encina
pool on Saturday afternoon. Louis Mc-
Lane, swimming commissioner, noticed
Coach Brandsten this morning that it
would be impossible to send a team to
Palo Alto.
McLane assigns as his reason for can
celling the meet the fact that two of his
star performers, and several more of his
entries, are forced to work on Saturday
afternoon. His action was entirely un
expected here. Swimming followers had
looked to see one of the most closely
contested meets of the season.
Brandsten had a strong aggregation
lined up in an e.ffort to defeat the Olym
pics. The fresh water of the Encina
tank was counted on as an advantage to
the Stanford swimmers.
The Cardinal forces would have been
weakened by the absence of Captain
Austin, who broke his ankle last night
playing basketball. Austin is regarded
as one of the fastest 100-yard men on
the Coast.
