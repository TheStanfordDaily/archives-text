# SCHEDULE FOR VARSITY QUINTET NOT COMPLETE
## Stanford Basketball Season Is Under Way But Meeting of P. C. C. Holds Up Games 
### 
With only two more weeks of real
practice remaining for the Stanford
varsity basketball squad before final
examinations this quarter, it is prac
tically certain that the first game of
the season will not be played until
after the first of the New Year.
Graduate Manager W. D. Fletcher
and Director of Athletics Walter
Powell will leave the campus before
December 8 to attend the meeting of
the Pacific Coast conference.
Definite schedules for basketball,
track and football will be adopted at
this conclave. Although the graduate
manager's office has tentatively ar
ranged the court' games for the 1922
may arise after the
coast conference has decided on its
dates and the Stanford schedule will
probably not be released for that sea
son until about December 10.
It is believed, however, that the
Cardinal varsity will make trips both
to the north to play Oregon and the
Oregon Aggies, and to Los Angeles to
meet U. S. C. and the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, which is arranging to
gather a strong basketball team for
the season.
Coach Van Gent at present has
close to seventy candidates reporting
for practice each night and the list
includes several men from the foot
ball varsity. It is probable that no cut
will be made in the squad until after
the Christmas holidays.
The varsity candidates take the En
cina gymnasium courts at 5 o'clock
each evening and work out for an
hour. The work thus far has con
sisted mainly of basket-shooting and
passing the ball. Inter-squad games
are expected to start within a few
days.
