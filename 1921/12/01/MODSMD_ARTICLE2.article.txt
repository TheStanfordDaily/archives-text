# KAPPA SIGMA WINS FAST COURT GAME FROM D. U. QUINTET
## 
### 
Kappa Sigma's basketers defeated
the Delta Upsilon quintet this morn
ing. by a score of 25 to 17, in the hard
est fought game played so far in the
first round of the intramural leagues.
A real court battle was staged from
start to finish, although the Delta Up
silon contingent failed to be very ef
fective until the second half. Both
teams showed splendid basketball ma
terials. Several of the men are fresh
men and varsity candidates. Last
year Delta Upsilon stood third in the
championship league, and Kappa Sig
ma was also the winner of league
plaque.
Kappa Sigma spells teamwork as
far is basketball is concerned. Short
passing and basket-shooting above the
average in accuracy completed their
scoring effectiveness. Shipke, for
ward, played a fast and aggressive
game, throwing baskets that netted
ten points. Middleton was consistent
at center and gained six points. Hood,
the third member of the Kappa Sigma
scoring combination, made an equal
number of tallies.
Lacey played a hard and steady
game at forward on the Delta Upsilon
five and tossed the largest number of
baskets. In the last half, Black went
into the contest and proved to be an
excellent partner for Lacey. Most of
the points were gained by this combi
nation. This game was the last to be
played during the present week on
account of the sophomore cotillion.
