# Once More--the "Hello" Habit.
## 
### 
We hear a great deal, usually at the beginning of
the quarter, about that most valued of valuable
Stanford customs, the practice of exchanging some
form of greeting in passing fellow students on the
campus. There is usually little difficulty in instilling
this spirit among the entering men, who slip easily
into the habits of a cheerful "hello" or "hello gents"
when encountering other members of the larger divi
sion of the student body.
But what of this spirit among the women? We
have waited in vain for the custom to take root
among the women of the freshman class. The feel
ing is prevalent that if they "don't know" women
whom they are passing on Quad, if they haven't "met
them formally or officially they are not constrained
to greet them.
Perhaps the fault is on the part of women who
have been at the University longer, and who have
failed to realize, the importance of carrying on this
tradition. The women are a small unit and can make
of Organized Women a group in which there is a
feeling of good comradeship and intimacy.
It is time to correct this obstacle in the develop
ment of the social relations of the women of the
University and to reestablish a worthwhile tradition
among them. Whether you know a woman only by
sight, or even though her face is entirely unfamiliar,
you have in common the bond of college life which
makes you intimately related. Besides, this cheer
ful recognition of fellow students gives you a feeling
which is well worth trying.
Old and new women should co-operate in preserv
ing and encouraging in their midst the "hello tradi
tion" before it slips from them. M. J. C.
