# Facilitating Honor.
## 
### 
It is interesting to learn of the methods used in
installing and maintaining the Honor System in
other universities. At Willamette University several
innovations have recently been advocated and a heat
ed discussion has resulted over a proposal to adopt
them.
The northern students propose to warn the entire
class that cheating is going on during an examination
by tapping on the floor. Obviously such a practice
will be more detrimental than it will be benefiicial.
If forty or fifty students are busy writing an exami
nation and some one student conceives' the idea that
some other member of the class is cheating he im
mediately begins a hubbub that disturbs the rest of
the class, who join in. Certainly but one or two will
know who is doing the cheating, and in case there are
several sensitive people in the room they are apt to
appear uncomfortable and direction of the tapping
will be at them rather than at the guilty party. Then,
too, such a practice will prove fertile field for the so
called practical joker who will start the tapping to
promote the discomfiture of a friend or to see if. it
worksâ€”just as the shepherd boy cried "Wolf!
Wolf!" to see what the response would be.
Honor, in the ordinary use of the word, is a matter
of principle and is based upon ideals that are thought
to exist in the hearts of every true American. To
give publicity by means of tapping, or to serve such
a warning is obviously a weakening of the Honor
System.
