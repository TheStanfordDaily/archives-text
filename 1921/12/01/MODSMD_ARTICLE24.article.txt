Quite a storm recently... Coeducational elements were
electrified with shocks and rained objections on North
western methods.
* * *
Only one way to settle it. An East-West debate.
Make it a regular thing. The forensic battle of the
century. Bids are expected hourly from the Santa Ana
Tournament of Lettuce. And there ought to be a fund
started to bring Lydia Pinkham west for the clash.
* * *
Teams will be chosen immediately, so that actual
practice and collection of data can go forward without
a hitch... Entire squad will go into intensive training at
once.
The topic for debate is the big question. At time
of going to press the following questions had been
challenged by the Roble watchman:
"Should you struggle too much while being- kissed?"
"Should you struggle at all?"
"Why?"
"Do you prefer the Sheik kiss, or will it rub the color
off?"
♦ * *
The dope indicates that the West will score an over
whelming victory. A rebuttal such as the following
offered by a Cal co-ed would clinch any debate: "f have
no thoughts at a 11... It is a strange subject."
* ♦ #
Hugo, the midnight moth, fouled the lampshade, when
he remarked that, with sixty men starting the open
season on baskets, Stanford ought to bag the limit.

CABBAGES' CONCERT CRITIC
The technique of "The Second String Beanery" had
as its panoramic basis the epic by the same name, who
wrote it in freehand verse as a lyric dirge. The com
position centers on a long drawn-out not from the trom
bones, suggestive of the vast Japanese steppes at the
soup hour. A melancholy strain hinting at the futile
attempts to assimilate the fluid with chopsticks is in
troduced as a minor theme. This introduction is fol
lowed by the main prologue, which opens in a* xylo
phone overtone typifying the brilliant sweep of the
cracker crumbs into the diner's lap.
* * *
The next measure conveys a triumphant fortissimo
with the flfes thrown into high, as brooms whisk the
rice from the bowls to its destination. The chopstick
motif is again symbolized by symphonic dischords, and
the whole picture rises to glorious heights of exuberant
reminiscence in the persistent notes of the kettle drum
mer.
* * *
At the end of the overture the sprightly funeral theme
is again seen by the listener.

War—ls hereby declared on that guy that cops Wed
nesday's stuff.

We announce the opening of that stirring drama by
Professor Springs X. Daly: "Three Weeks." Thrills!
Chills! Bills!

Dear Head of Cabbage: —
Unable as I am to withstand the public pressure, I
hereby submit to you a pome written over a year ago
for and of the many Bills now in the alumni:
There's a girl on the Quad you may possibly see,
And we'll call her just Betty, the Betty for me,
She's a smile and a nod,
As you pass on the Quad.
And says Billie, she's Betty, she's Betty, oh me.
There are co-eds that frown, there are co-eds that stare,
And there are damsels with noses high in the air,
But this girl is a pal,
Democratical gal,
And says Billie, she's Betty, a Betty for fair.
There are girls that you never can ever can know,
There are co-eds that always will hunt a new beau,
But the co-ed please send
Who is simply a friend, •
Just a Betty you see with a pleasant HELLO.
• * *
Famous Phrases of Famous Reporters:—(Worth Wil
son, of a Cheeri-o beauty), "She is tall, yet graceful."
As if the pine is not more graceful than the scrub oak!
* * *
I would say to Susan, the Cal Co-Ed Colyumnist, that,
as the story said, a wolf in lamb's clothing may be ter
rifying, but Little Red Riding Hood is very fond of
Bears with sheepskins!
» * «
As Cal views it: The redoubtable Dink, '98, is dead,
Patrick, '07, is passee, but Art Wilcox, '0&i/ 2 still sur
vives!

While on the subject of headlines, it might interest
you to know that, to aid print paper standardization

ago today reduced the width of their columns from a

The technique of "The Second String Beanery" had
as its panoramic basis the epic by the same name, who
wrote it in freehand verse as a lyric dirge. The com
position centers on a long drawn-out not from the trom

attempts to assimilate the fluid with chopsticks is in
troduced as a minor theme. This introduction is fol

Dear Head of Cabbage: —
Unable as I am to withstand the public pressure, I
hereby submit to you a pome written over a year ago
for and of the many Bills now in the alumni:
There's a girl on the Quad you may possibly see,
And we'll call her just Betty, the Betty for me,
She's a smile and a nod,
As you pass on the Quad.
And says Billie, she's Betty, she's Betty, oh me.
There are co-eds that frown, there are co-eds that stare,
And there are damsels with noses high in the air,
But this girl is a pal,
Democratical gal,
And says Billie, she's Betty, a Betty for fair.
There are girls that you never can ever can know,
There are co-eds that always will hunt a new beau,
But the co-ed please send
Who is simply a friend, •
Just a Betty you see with a pleasant HELLO.
• * *
Famous Phrases of Famous Reporters:—(Worth Wil
son, of a Cheeri-o beauty), "She is tall, yet graceful."
As if the pine is not more graceful than the scrub oak!
* * *
I would say to Susan, the Cal Co-Ed Colyumnist, that,
as the story said, a wolf in lamb's clothing may be ter
rifying, but Little Red Riding Hood is very fond of
Bears with sheepskins!
» * «
As Cal views it: The redoubtable Dink, '98, is dead,
Patrick, '07, is passee, but Art Wilcox, '0&i/ 2 still sur
vives!

There are girls that you never can ever can know,
There are co-eds that always will hunt a new beau,
But the co-ed please send
Who is simply a friend, •
Just a Betty you see with a pleasant HELLO.

Quite a storm recently... Coeducational elements were

Only one way to settle it. An East-West debate.
Make it a regular thing. The forensic battle of the
century. Bids are expected hourly from the Santa Ana
Tournament of Lettuce. And there ought to be a fund
started to bring Lydia Pinkham west for the clash.

Teams will be chosen immediately, so that actual
practice and collection of data can go forward without
a hitch... Entire squad will go into intensive training at
once.
The topic for debate is the big question. At time
of going to press the following questions had been
challenged by the Roble watchman:
"Should you struggle too much while being- kissed?"
"Should you struggle at all?"
"Why?"
"Do you prefer the Sheik kiss, or will it rub the color
off?"

The dope indicates that the West will score an over

CABBAGES' CONCERT CRITIC
The technique of "The Second String Beanery" had
as its panoramic basis the epic by the same name, who
wrote it in freehand verse as a lyric dirge. The com
position centers on a long drawn-out not from the trom
bones, suggestive of the vast Japanese steppes at the
soup hour. A melancholy strain hinting at the futile
attempts to assimilate the fluid with chopsticks is in
troduced as a minor theme. This introduction is fol
lowed by the main prologue, which opens in a* xylo
phone overtone typifying the brilliant sweep of the
cracker crumbs into the diner's lap.
* * *
The next measure conveys a triumphant fortissimo
with the flfes thrown into high, as brooms whisk the
rice from the bowls to its destination. The chopstick
motif is again symbolized by symphonic dischords, and
the whole picture rises to glorious heights of exuberant
reminiscence in the persistent notes of the kettle drum
mer.
* * *
At the end of the overture the sprightly funeral theme
is again seen by the listener.

S. G. Trimble, Thursday Section Boss.
Dear Head of Cabbage: —
Unable as I am to withstand the public pressure, I
hereby submit to you a pome written over a year ago
for and of the many Bills now in the alumni:
There's a girl on the Quad you may possibly see,
And we'll call her just Betty, the Betty for me,
She's a smile and a nod,
As you pass on the Quad.
And says Billie, she's Betty, she's Betty, oh me.
There are co-eds that frown, there are co-eds that stare,
And there are damsels with noses high in the air,
But this girl is a pal,
Democratical gal,
And says Billie, she's Betty, a Betty for fair.
There are girls that you never can ever can know,
There are co-eds that always will hunt a new beau,
But the co-ed please send
Who is simply a friend, •
Just a Betty you see with a pleasant HELLO.
