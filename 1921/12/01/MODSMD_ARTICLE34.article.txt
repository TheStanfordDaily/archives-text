# HEATED DISCUSSION OVER HONOR SYSTEM IN NORTH
## 
### 
WILLAMETTE UNIVERSITY, Sa
lem, Ore., Dec. 1 (P. I. N. S.) â€”The tap
idea in the Honor Code is the center of
heated discussion on the campus. A tap
on the floor to notify classroom students
that cheating is going on, a written hon
or tradition that will inveigh against dis
honesty in examination, against note
book cheating, and against the -"open
book" policy, and a publicity committee
to actively encourage the propagation of
the honor tradition, were the recommen
dations of the Honor System committee
in its report to the associated student
body Monday. The. "tapping system"
provides that any student upon ob
serving cheating going on the classroom,
should tap upon the floor to notify the
class.
It is the claim of the advocates that
this will have a strong prohibitive in
fluence over the tendency to cheat.
