# University of Paris Is Lecture Feature Before Cercle Francais
## 
### 
Last evening at an unusually large
gathering of the Cercle Francais, at
the Sigma Kappa house, Professor
Johnston spoke on some of the inter
esting features of the University of
Paris, especially its beautiful art gal
leries and fine libraries. Many sports
which before the war were almost un
known, have now begun to come into
prominence, such as tennis, hockey
and baseball. "Before the war, most
of the Americans had a mistaken no
tion," said Professor Johnston, "that
the French people were all small, had
black hair and eyes, and spent most
of their evening in cabarets. They
found, upon going over there, that
many Frenchmen were over six feet
and that they study harder than stu
dents from almost any other nation.
Frances Willis, '20, who recently
returned from Belgium, where she has
been studying, told the club some of
her experiences there. She spoke of
the fact that the tennis champion of
all the Belgian universities last year,
was an American who had a Belgian
scholarship. There is no campus life
as practically all universities are
situated in a city, and the students
live in the various homes nearby.
