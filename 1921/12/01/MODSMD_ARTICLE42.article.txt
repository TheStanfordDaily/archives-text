# TAYLOR IS BACK FROM CONFERENCE
## Secretary of Food Research Institute Believes Session Will Succeed in Object 
### 
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, who attended the
Paris Peace Conference, and who has
just returned to the Stanford campus
from an eastern trip during which he
spent several days in Washington, and
visited the Disarmament Conference
there, believes that the present confer
ence will succeed in the two main
questions which it is considering.
"In Washington," he says, "one has
the feeling that Secretary Hughes has
placed his proposition of naval dis
armament upon such a plane that it
will be accepted without material
modification. Similarly I believe a
formula for the Pacific Ocean and
China will be adopted and that under
this formula international relations in
China during the next decade will be
developed."
Dr. Taylor went East on work of
the Stanford Food Research Institute,
of which he is executive secretary, and
while in Washington heard Briand's
speech at the conference. Dr. Taylor
attended the sessions of the Paris
Peace Conference as an expert cdn
nected with the Supreme Economic
Council, and says that the difference
in the atmosphere of the present con
ference and that of the former im
presses one immediately.
"The striking thing about the Con
ference in Washington, to one who
was conversant with conditions in
Washington," he says, "is the differ
ence in atmosphere. Paris had the at
mosphere of trading; Washington has
the atmosphere of proselytizing. A
new doctrine has been propounded by
the American government. The Con

ference looks forward rather than
backward.
"These two accomplishment attain
ed, I take it that the Conference will
adjourn. 1 do not believe the Con
ference will take up the subject of
land aramament in Europe as it is
taking up the subject of naval arma
ment. I do not believe the Conference
will take up the subject of economic
conditions in Europe as it is taking
up the subject of the open door in

China.
"I interpret the address of Briand —
that was a remarkable forensic effort
irrespective of content —as indicating
that Europe expects at this time no
specific consideration in the agenda
of this Conference, but that at some
future time the subject of disarma
ment in Europe and reconstruction of
economic conditions may form the sub
jects of a future international confer
i ence."
