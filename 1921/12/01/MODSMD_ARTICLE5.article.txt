# ROLL OF YEARLING COURT SQUAD NOW NEAR HUNDRED MARK
## 
### 
Coach Seay's hopc.s of having seventy
live candidates out for the freshman
basketball squad by the end of this week
were more than realized yesterday aft
ernoon, when over eighty of the first
year men appeared in trunks and ;er
seys.
As the men lined up in groups to take
their turns at shooting baskets, it ap
peared to an observer on the sidelines
that the whole freshman class had
turned out to answer basketball roll
call. If quantity of material has any
thing to do with the making of a good
court squad, Seay's young army should
carry everything before them.
Judging from what little basket shoot
ing was done yesterday, the yearling as
pirants are a rather rough and motley
crew. Several of them had the form
and poise which several years of expe
rience alone can give, but on the whole
it looks as though Coach Seay has a big
job ahead of him, especially for the rest
of this quarter.
Scrimmage will be started this after
noon and each man will be given about
five minutes to show what he can do in
actual play. These practice games will
be continued during the rest of this
quarter, and it is Seay's plan to give
every man a chance to prove his merits.
At the end of the quarter the first cut in
the squad will be made.
The freshman schedule is not entirely
confirmed as yet, and will he given out
later. Mountain View is the first ag
gregation to invade the campus, and this
game will be January 7.
