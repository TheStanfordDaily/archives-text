# "YOU NEVER CAN TELL" PROMISES REAL TREAT
## 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
The Sophomore class has in store
for us a rare and promising treat, dis
closed in a pre-view of the pre-dress
rehearsal of last evening. It is abso

to the highest degree.
No opportunity is missing for mak

comedy available. Perhaps you like
the dry subtle kind of. humor —sar-
castic, satiric thrusts —or maybe the
sauve, careless, off-hand comments of
an aspiring young professional gentle
man. Then there is the ridiculous, un-
