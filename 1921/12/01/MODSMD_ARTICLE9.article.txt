# "YOU NEVER CAN TELL" PROMISES REAL TREAT
## 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
The Sophomore class has in store
for us a rare and promising treat, dis
closed in a pre-view of the pre-dress
rehearsal of last evening. It is abso
lutely safe to prophesy that when "You
Never Can Tell" is presented to the
campus public on Saturday evening
the class of 1924 will introduce to us
a truly remarkable constellation of
new dramatic stars.
One's first impression, discounting,
of course, the naturallv-to-be-expected
enjoyment of a Shaw play itself, is
that the dramatis personnae is ex
tremely well cast. It is the players
that make the play. To watch the
cast members of "You Never Can
Tell" step into their respective parts
would make you think they had been
performing in such roles all their lives.
It is really surprising to see a set of
characters, picked from a limited
group in university life fit so perfectly
into their characterizations. The cur
tain goes up and you expect to view

the faces of familiar campus associ
ates. But no. Immediately their
every day identity vanishes, and one
beholds a group of characters trans
planted to merry England, completely
immersed in their parts and playing
them with a degree of professionalism
that is nothing if not startling for a
preliminary dress rehearsal.
Perhaps the far-seeing eye of Coach
Gordon Davis is not a little respons
ible for the perfect sympathy of the
members of his cast with their vari
ous parts. At any rate, they are a
group of- people who can appreciate
eomedy situations and put them over
to the highest degree.
No opportunity is missing for mak
ing the most of all the brands of
comedy available. Perhaps you like
the dry subtle kind of. humor —sar-
castic, satiric thrusts —or maybe the
sauve, careless, off-hand comments of
an aspiring young professional gentle
man. Then there is the ridiculous, un-
conscious form of wit —a combination
of sublime and ridiculous —as well as
numerous and novel almost slap-stick
kinds. If you prefer good rollicking
fun, pure and simple, there are the
antics of two barbarian youngsters
who keep up a constant play of effer
vescent deviltry.
"You Never Can Tell" is a play of
many surprises. There is always a
turn which you won't expect. In-

wardly you will laugh at the expedi
encies of Norris James in his dental
establishment. You can feel the s,ubtle
interplay of liumor in the affairs of
the McComas household, smile at the
appealing drollery of Samuel Men
denhall as the delightful and benevol
ent old waiter, and just as you begin
to sense the approach of the tragic,
in the hopelessness of the young den
tist's love affair to feel sorry for John
Richers, the grouchy old father who
cannot understand his twentieth cen
tury children —Helen Whitney comes
dancing across the stage, followed
by John Vaughan as her irrepressible
twin, and the situation is saved for the
spirit of comedy.
Evidently the cast is bent on giving
us all the genuine comedy (and there
are quantities of it) which it is pos
sible to extract from the play and one
can be assured of nothing but per
fect enjoyment to be had from "You
Never Can Tell."

Gordon Davis is not a little respons
ible for the perfect sympathy of the
members of his cast with their vari
ous parts. At any rate, they are a
group of- people who can appreciate
eomedy situations and put them over
to the highest degree.
No opportunity is missing for mak
ing the most of all the brands of
comedy available. Perhaps you like
the dry subtle kind of. humor —sar-
castic, satiric thrusts —or maybe the
sauve, careless, off-hand comments of
an aspiring young professional gentle
man. Then there is the ridiculous, un-
conscious form of wit —a combination
of sublime and ridiculous —as well as
numerous and novel almost slap-stick
kinds. If you prefer good rollicking
fun, pure and simple, there are the
antics of two barbarian youngsters
who keep up a constant play of effer
vescent deviltry.
"You Never Can Tell" is a play of
many surprises. There is always a
turn which you won't expect. In-

wardly you will laugh at the expedi
encies of Norris James in his dental
establishment. You can feel the s,ubtle
interplay of liumor in the affairs of
the McComas household, smile at the
appealing drollery of Samuel Men
denhall as the delightful and benevol
ent old waiter, and just as you begin
to sense the approach of the tragic,
in the hopelessness of the young den
tist's love affair to feel sorry for John
Richers, the grouchy old father who
cannot understand his twentieth cen
tury children —Helen Whitney comes
dancing across the stage, followed
by John Vaughan as her irrepressible
twin, and the situation is saved for the
spirit of comedy.
Evidently the cast is bent on giving
us all the genuine comedy (and there
are quantities of it) which it is pos
sible to extract from the play and one
can be assured of nothing but per
fect enjoyment to be had from "You
Never Can Tell."


HELEN WHITNEY
The mischievous twin, one of the
main reasons for the sparkling
comedy of, "You Never Can Tell"
The Sophomore class has in store
for us a rare and promising treat, dis
closed in a pre-view of the pre-dress
rehearsal of last evening. It is abso
lutely safe to prophesy that when "You
Never Can Tell" is presented to the
campus public on Saturday evening
the class of 1924 will introduce to us
a truly remarkable constellation of
new dramatic stars.
One's first impression, discounting,
of course, the naturallv-to-be-expected
enjoyment of a Shaw play itself, is
that the dramatis personnae is ex
tremely well cast. It is the players
that make the play. To watch the
cast members of "You Never Can
Tell" step into their respective parts
would make you think they had been
performing in such roles all their lives.
It is really surprising to see a set of
characters, picked from a limited
group in university life fit so perfectly
into their characterizations. The cur
tain goes up and you expect to view

the faces of familiar campus associ
ates. But no. Immediately their
every day identity vanishes, and one
beholds a group of characters trans
planted to merry England, completely
immersed in their parts and playing
them with a degree of professionalism
that is nothing if not startling for a
preliminary dress rehearsal.
Perhaps the far-seeing eye of Coach
Gordon Davis is not a little respons
ible for the perfect sympathy of the
members of his cast with their vari
ous parts. At any rate, they are a
group of- people who can appreciate
