# SOPHOMORES TO START FESTIVITY WITH COTILLION
## Big Canopy of Orange, White and Violet is Hoisted; 265 Admission Tickets Sold

"Hey, you on the center girder! Drop
that ice cream cone and jerk up a few
yards of slack. Move on, you birds who
aren't doing anything and give those
women a chance to sew that roof to
gether. Hey—Oh, it's no use! Let's
all go home. Can't have a dance. No
body'll work. Cant—well, for the sake
of—can't you see that that is nailed—?"
The speech might have been from any
of the bosses, imbued with the same
spirit of impressionism as they all were.
At this point the fresh shift of cotillion
decorators saved the day, and the relief
was sent to ascend the gymnasium raf
ters.
Last evening's work consisted chiefly
in hoisting the big canopy of orange,
white and violet stripes into place. To
fasten the cloth roof took most of the
night. Large wires are strung from one
side of the gymnasium to the other sup
porting the false top. These wires are
held in place by smaller ones attached
to the ceiling. The walls are hung in
brown and violet, and look well as a
base for the colorful top. All that re
mained to be done this morning was the
installation of the lights and the appli
cation of the finishing touches. All is
ready.
Cloth was used this year to avoid the
possibility of fire from the heat of the
liglUs which threatened to burn up the
room decorations last year. The con
nection of the ten spots was finished this
afternoon. All is in readiness for the
sympathetic display. Dimmers are con
nected to each spotlight which will al
low them to be reduced or intensified
to the correct blend to express the mood
of the music.
There are about 265 tickets out, in
cluding complementaries, which indi
cates that the dance will be much larger
than last year's cotillion and perhaps
larger than any of last season's parties.
A good representation of sophomores
turned out from all the living groups to
help decorate for their big dance this
evening. The work proceeded rapidly
and in a well organized fashion. This
is most graphically shown by the amount
accomplished.
Chairman John Richer asks that
queeners observe the old tradition in re
spect to flowers. It is hoped that no
body will be conspicuous and wear a
cor-age.
