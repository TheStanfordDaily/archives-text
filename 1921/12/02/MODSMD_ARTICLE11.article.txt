# RUSSIAN ARTISTS WILL GIVE JOINT CONCERT TUESDAY
## Mishel Piastro and Alfred Mirovitch Are Well Received In Tour 
### 
Alfred Mirovitch and Mishel Piastro,
the two Russian artists who will be pre
sented by the Peninsula Musical Asso
ciation in the opening concert of the or
ganization on next Tuesday evening, are
considered by many critics to be among
the foremost younger musicians of the
day.
A number of favorable criticisms
have been expressed in cities whe.re the
two previously almost unheralded art
ists have appeared. Of Alfred Miro
vitch, pianist, the New York Times

said: "He displays rare musical quali
ties. A player of almost uncanny clear
ness, revealing dynamic values that
range from inner voices of orchestral
chords to vanishing melodies. His
Chopin funeral march sent shivers down
the listeners' backs, as if they were
listening to a ghost story."
The New York Tribune made the fol
lowing comment on his playing: "He
scored in his first recital. He has fin
gers of steel and technic of the. first
rank," while the Evening Telegraph
called him "one of the too few artists of
the first grade."
After the first concert given in the
metropolis by Mischel Piastro, Henry
E. Krehbiel, a well-kinown authority,
pronounced his tone "something in which
to rejoice. He may write his name
large upon the long list of virtuosi."
Another critic, William B. Murray, in a
lengthy article in the Brooklyn Eagle,
on violinists of this clay, sad : "At the
present writing, we believe that only one
of the newcomers has a chance for suc
cess in America. He, of course, is Mi
shel Piastro."
Musical America ended a highly fa
vorable critique of his second New York
recital by saying: "There can be 110
question about Mr. Piastro being one of
the greatest violinists of our time. His
tone is voluminous and of a splendid
quality. Since the advent of Jascha
Heifitz and Toscha Seidel we have
heard 110 violinist of more conspicuous
attainment than this Russian, who is
certainly the most important new vio
linist the season has brought us."
