## Three Men New to Stanford Varsity To Uphold Cardinal's Position in Favor of Canal Toll Exemption 
### (By WORTH W. CALDWELL, '24 
Tonight at 8 o'clock In the Stanford Assembly Hall, the Cardinal debating
team will clash with the squad representing the University of California, in
the supreme forensic contest of the Pacific Coast. The two teams go into
the fray very evenly matched and it is a difficult matter at this time to fore
cast the probable outcome of the engagement.
Debating Coach Emerson, when interviewed last night, made the follow
ing statement in regard to the team which he has coached:
"I am certainly satisfied with results thus far and feel that the team will
put up a very strong fight."
Stanford is fortunate at this time in having four extremely capable and
talented men to represent it in the debate tonight. Every one of tho

argument.
Matthew Tobriner, '24, will open the
debate for the Cardinal. He has an
excellent delivery and a very soothing
manner. Tobriner has taken part in
several other important debates in the
University and has always acquitted
himself admirably. He is a student
in the Law department and a mem
ber of Euphronia deflating society.
Lowell High School in San Francisco
claims him as her product. Tobriner
is also a member of Encina Club.
The second speaker will be Knox
Miller, *23, a transfer here from the
University of Texas, and a strong
orator. He has a very animated, very
clear and very convincing style that
invariably wins the approval of all his
hearers. This will mark his first ap
pearance on the Stanford platform.
He has been chosen by the Coach to
make the only rebuttal for the team.
Miller is also an Encina Club man.
Richard Jenkins, '25, will close the
debate. He entered Stanford this Fall,
coming from Los Angeles, where he
distinguished himself in many high
school contests. He speaks, according
to those who have heard him, very
slowly and calmly, but with great
power and force.
The alternate, Bertrand Comparet,
'24, although one of the hardest work
ers on the team, will have scant op
