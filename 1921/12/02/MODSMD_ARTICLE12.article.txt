# STANFORD WILL CLASH WITH CALIFORNIA TONIGHT IN BIG ANNUAL FORENSIC CONTEST
## Three Men New to Stanford Varsity To Uphold Cardinal's Position in Favor of Canal Toll Exemption 
### (By WORTH W. CALDWELL, '24 
Tonight at 8 o'clock In the Stanford Assembly Hall, the Cardinal debating
team will clash with the squad representing the University of California, in
the supreme forensic contest of the Pacific Coast. The two teams go into
the fray very evenly matched and it is a difficult matter at this time to fore
cast the probable outcome of the engagement.
Debating Coach Emerson, when interviewed last night, made the follow
ing statement in regard to the team which he has coached:
"I am certainly satisfied with results thus far and feel that the team will
put up a very strong fight."
Stanford is fortunate at this time in having four extremely capable and
talented men to represent it in the debate tonight. Every one of tho

men on the team has had a large
amount of training and practical ex
perience and is consequently thorough
ly capable of upholding his end of the
argument.
Matthew Tobriner, '24, will open the
debate for the Cardinal. He has an
excellent delivery and a very soothing
manner. Tobriner has taken part in
several other important debates in the
University and has always acquitted
himself admirably. He is a student
in the Law department and a mem
ber of Euphronia deflating society.
Lowell High School in San Francisco
claims him as her product. Tobriner
is also a member of Encina Club.
The second speaker will be Knox
Miller, *23, a transfer here from the
University of Texas, and a strong
orator. He has a very animated, very
clear and very convincing style that
invariably wins the approval of all his
hearers. This will mark his first ap
pearance on the Stanford platform.
He has been chosen by the Coach to
make the only rebuttal for the team.
Miller is also an Encina Club man.
Richard Jenkins, '25, will close the
debate. He entered Stanford this Fall,
coming from Los Angeles, where he
distinguished himself in many high
school contests. He speaks, according
to those who have heard him, very
slowly and calmly, but with great
power and force.
The alternate, Bertrand Comparet,
'24, although one of the hardest work
ers on the team, will have scant op
portunity to share the approval of the
audience. Comparet is a good speaker
and a splendid research worker. The
assistance that he revered the team
in that respect will be invaluable in
the debate tonight. Comparet is a
Nestorian.
The four men who will uphold the
honor of the University wound up
their long and tedious preparation yes
terday afternoon. Research and
brief-making has occupied the major
part of their time this quarter. Their
final workout took up most of the day
ye terday and was held in the As
sembly Hall to enable the different
speakers to acquaint themselves with
the actual conditions under wliicli they
will talk. Today, they are enjoying
a brief respite as a means of relaxa
tion before entering the fray. Every
one of the men will go into the de
bate well prepared, carefully coached
and in the very best possible physical
condition, in an attempt to wrest a
victory from the over-confident Bears
from across the Bay. For some years,
California has' succeeded in defeating
the Stanford debaters and every ef-1
fort will be put forth this year to
prevent a repetition of the old jinx.
The student body committee on de-:
bating, headed by Ross Fisher, '22,
has been fortunate in securing repre
sentative San Francisco men to act
as judges tonight. Archbishop Hanna
of the Bay Diocese will be present.
The Archbishop is a prominent figure
in San Francisco's intellectual life and
is well qualified to serve as one of
the moderators in this contest. Percy
Long, member of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce and influential
attorney, is another one of the trio of
judges. Associate Justice Waste of
the California Supreme Court is ex
pected to arrive on the campus in time
to act as the third judge of the debate. |
All these men are students of inter
national problems and should be able
to look at the question from a broad,
unbiased standpoint.
Reports from Berkeley Indicate that
the students there are taking more in
terest in this battle royal than they
have shown in many years. Last night
for the first time in the history of the
institution, a student body debating
rally was conducted at which Presi
dent Barrows was one of the principal
speakers. Thus, the team was given
a fitting send-off on the eve of its de
parture for the Stanford campus. A
good deal of enthusiasm was created
at this- huge student-body rally.
As an interesting and somewhat
prophetic sidelight on the big event
of the evening. Coach Emerson em
phatically states that no red ties will
be worn by any member of the Stan
ford aggregation. When pressed for
the reason for this novel injunction,
the coach remarked that some years
ago a Cardinal team lost the decision
in what seemed to be a sure Stanford
victory. The judges were asked for
their grounds for what appeared to be
an unusual decision. They gave as
their only objection, the fact that the
Stanford debaters were each wearing
a bright red necktie. No such oppor
tunity will be given the judges tonight
as the team will all take pains to at
tire themselves in neckwear of a more
sombre hue.
The contest begins promptly at 8
o'clock and the public is cordially in
vited to attend. As there will be only
one rebuttal on each side, the time
consumed will be materially shortened.
