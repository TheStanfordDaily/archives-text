### 
The donation by Professor Wing, designer of the
Stanford stadium, and Professor of Structural Engi
neering, of the money, which is rightfully his for his
work and excrcise of skill in planning the howl, to the
fund for student scholarships, is noteworthy in sev
eral respects.
Here is the instance of a man who has exercised
all of the ingenuity acquired through years of study
and training; the sum of all of his experiences of his
years of teaching and planning of Structural projects
in the consummation and execution of plans for what
is undoubtedly the greatest engineering project of its
kind that the country has ever seen. As an expert, he
is rightfully entitled to two per cent of the entire cost
of construction, which, in this case, is a sum above
$.5,000. Yet he refuses payment for services which
he spent years of preparation to be able to render
and turns the money into a scholarship whereby needy
students in the Department of Civil Engineering may
be aided.
It is notable in another instance because Professor
Wing was never a student in Stanford, although he
is one of its builders.
Students ordinarily regard members of the fac
ulty as beings in another world. They are the drivers,
the persons who set hard tasks, persons who take a
selfish delight in making the life of the student diffi
cult. Yet here is a member of the faculty who has
the interests of the University so much at heart that
he gladly gives his time and knowledge to the fur
therance of a project that adds to the national pres
tige of Stanford and then returns his fee to the
University to be used in aiding students who are
acually working for an education.
This is not the only case of a service performed
by a member of the faculty for the University and
for the students. It is commented upon here be
cause of the publicity it has gained and because of
the circumstances out of which it arose. Faculty
members are doing things every day that are un
selfish and are doing them with the sole purpose of
building a greater University. Often these things
do not come to light because the quiet spirit which
prompts them does not permit.
There is a lesson to be drawn from this case. That
is, that the faculty of this University is doing all that
it can to further University enterprises, student en
terprises, and the welfare of the University as a
whole.
It is well to bear in mind when we are asked to
make some slight sacrifice of time, money, and
energy for the furtherance of some enterprise that
the members of the faculty, as well as the Board of
Trustees and the University officials, are doing all
that they can for the same purpose. They are all
Stanford men.
