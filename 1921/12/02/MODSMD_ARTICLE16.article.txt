# Are Students Interested?
## 
### 
Students have been accused time and time again
of knowing little of and displaying less interest in the
happenings of the world. Several times every year
the cry is made that students exhibit a woeful lack
of interest in the news of political, social, and intel
lectual developments in the outside world. This is
true to a very great extent, and the ordinary defense
is that the student finds all of his time taken up in
trying to keep abreast of the race of studies and ac
tivities which fill his daily life.
There is a very great reason why university stu
dents should keep themselves informed about things
that are happening in the contemporaneous world
about them. Mature men of today are wrestling with
problems, which, when determined, will affect the
safety and security of the world in years to come and
so vitally affect the future welfare of every stu
dent. The manner in which these problems are met
and dealt with should be known by the university
student today because he will be the mature man,
the thinker, and the builder of tomorrow.
Students as a general thing do not find time to
read the accounts of world happenings in the daily
newspapers. Reading of the metropolitan press re

quires a careful scanning and selection that the ordi
nary student does not find time for.
It is our belief that a short resume of the day's
news, written in a smart and concjse manner, will be
read by the students of Stanford University. Be
cause of this belief the Daily is introducing a new
column today which will contain in brief the impor
tant events in the political, social, and intellectual
\world. This column probably will be conducted in
conjunction with the Stanford History Club and
will be edited daily by members of that organiza
tion.
The colunln will be on trial for the balance of the
quarter, and students will be given an opportunity to
show that they are really interested in the things
that are going on about them and that the real reason
for ignorance on these subjects is a lack of time and
not of desire. If the column is found to be of real
value in disseminating world news among the stu
dents it will be maintained as a regular department
of the Daily.
