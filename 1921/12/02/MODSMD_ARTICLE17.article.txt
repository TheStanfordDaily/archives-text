Cabbages' special correspondent at the Peace Con
ference has sent in the following account via our Least
Wire. (The least said about it, the better.)
The Conference has met. It will soon meet again.
Japan sent representatives. So did England. So did
France. So did other nations.
They discussed several questions, among them the
disarming of the Peruvian navy. They decided to limit
it to one battleship. But the Peruvians obpect. They
said that this would be cutting the navy in two. The
final decision was that Peru could have a battleship and
two row boats.
The island of Yap came under consideration. Eng
land said it was hers. So did Japan. So did America.
So did everybody. The meeting broke up when France
called Japan a camel. England objected. So did Japan.
So did America. So did Peru. So did everybody. A
committee was appointed to consider the matter. Eng
land left. So did France. So did Japan. So did Peru.
So did everybody.

HOME, SWEET HOME.—I92I.
Oh, every song and every lay that we now chance to
hear,
They always sing of happy homes a thousand miles
from here,
They tell of going back to ma, way down in Alabam,
Of giving up their high class food, for good old
fashioned ham.
They chant of lonesome heroes who have strayed far
from the fold,
And how they miss their mammy, since they're out here
in the cold.
But me, I have no craving for to wander 'way back
home.
I'm having too much wicked fun out here upon my
own.
I'm seeing all the cabarets, nad learning how to smoke,
If I can stay another year. Sweet Daddy will be broke.
I have no craving for the food we had back on the
farm,
My clothes aren't means for service, nor yet to keep
me warm.
I comb my hair with slickest oil, and grease it to my
head,
And Saturday is Sunday, before I get to bed.
The height .of my ambition —you must admit it's
great—
I want to have somebody say, "Ain't he collegiate?"

Ye California Stadium Committee asks Cabbages the
greatest riddle of the year: Did you ever see a knot
hole in a Stadium wall? We looked over California's
mammoth concrete Stadium, and we didn't find a single
one. Conclusion reached: There are Noknotholes in
California's Stadium. —Q. E. D.

HOW OLD IS ANN?
Old Satan, he was angry, and he gnashed his teeth
with rage,
"How in Hades can a fellow ever hope to guess their
age?
With all those frills and furbelows, it's got me stumped
for fair.
Gee, women are a problem." Poor old Satan tore his
hair.
"I'd give one-half my kingdom, and the coolest place
in Hell,
To the person who informs me, how a woman's age to
tell."
This earnest proclamation, printed on asbestos board.
Was scattered thru the kingdom, from the Pit to
Styx's ford.
Yet, not a single devil, amonst all of Satan's clan,
Knew how to solve the riddle that has always puzzled
man.
One day some new arrivals came sliding to the Pit,
And in the group there was a youth, who said, "I'll
answer it."
"But as a prize I shall require my freedom from this
heat."
"You're on," cried Satan, in delight, "Now, .if you'll
just repeat
The formula, you may ascend to Earth's cool outer cup
The elevator's waiting—Press the button labeled 'Up.'"
With steady step and laughing face the youth approached
the cage,
"There's just one way". . . he winked his eye—"to tell
a woman's age."
He stepped inside, he closed the door with a loud, re
sounding boom.
"The only ones we're sure about —it's written on their
tombs."
