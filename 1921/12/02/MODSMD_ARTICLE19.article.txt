# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### (By R. C. B., '20 
It is reported today that naval ex
perts of England and America are in
clined to abandon the "naval holiday"
feature of the limitation of armaments
scheme on the ground that suitable
replacement would be difficult and
navy yards would fall to ruins. This
is not as dangerous a development as
might appear, for the essential fea
ture of a limilation on a 5-5-3 basis —
that is to say, giving Great Britain
and United States each a strength of
5 to Japan's 3—still remains.
Japan, however, continues to attack
the basis of the agreement, demanding
that her allotment of naval power be
increased to the rat,io of 10-10-7. The
crux of this dispute is that the Hughes
formula of 5-5-3 is based on a calcula
tion from present strength plus ton
nage laid down. Japan's % demand
seeks to introduce a new principle, for
she asks an increase in order to as
sure her safety. Such a principle, if
accepted, would wreck the Conference.
For every nation can argue that it
needs vast fleets on account tof its pe
culiar situation. England is depend
ent upon sea-power for food, and
America has two long coast lines upon
widely separated oceans. Yesterday,
however, the Japanese press agents
changed their tactics and put forth the
suggestion that Japan's present
strength had been understimated, and
that a ratio of 10-10-7 was justified
upon the original basis of the Hughes
allotment.
FOOD RIOTS IN VIENNA
Meanwhile Europe appears again
upon the front page. Food riots are
reported from Vienna. The disorders
are worse than any that have occur
red since the Hapsburgs made their
exit in 1918. The German mark rallies
from 980 to the pound sterling to 750
in the London exchange. The normal
exchange value of the mark is about
20 to the pound and four to the dollar.
The French have proposed that Ger
many be declared bankrupt and placed
under a receivership by the Allies, and
that the left bank of the Rhine be
made a permanently autonomous pro
vince. The British favor a moratori
um, that is to say, the granting of a
period of grace in which Germany
need make no payments.
MEAT PACKERS TO STRIKE
The union meat packers, numbering
45,000 and spread over half a dozen
middle-western cities, have called a
strike for December sth, on account
of a new wage cut.
