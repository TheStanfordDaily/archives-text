UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, Salt Lake
City, Dec. 2 (P. 1. N. S.) â€”In order to
enforce the ruling recently made by the
Board of Regents prohibiting the park
ing of automobiles on the circle, posts
and chains have been placed across the
entrances to the circle. The order came
as a result of a congestion and also to
take away the incentive to loaf in the
cars in good weather.
