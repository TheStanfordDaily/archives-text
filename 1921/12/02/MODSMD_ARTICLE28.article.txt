LEGE, Corvallis, Dec. 2 (P. I. N. S.) â€”
"What's the matter with the boys ?"
asks Dr. C. R. Matthis of the O. A. C.
health service- "The girls give com
paratively little trouble here at the hos
pital, and for every girl that enters this
office we have at least nine men."
One of the nurses in the health of
fice offered the suggestion that perhaps
the reason why so many more boys than
girls were, ill was due to the fact that
the girls took better care of themselves.
