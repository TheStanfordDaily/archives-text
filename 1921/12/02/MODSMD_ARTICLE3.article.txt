### 
Films depicting the processes of man
ufacture of dynamite, zinc oxide, and
the smelting of iron were shown Inst
night in the Little Theater under the
auspices of the Chemistry Club. Pro
fessors Rakestraw and Crook gave ex
planatory talks during the showing. Each
process was picturized from the elemen
tary steps with raw materials to the
placing of the finished product upon the
market.
Professor Rakestraw performed an
experiment with a small nitro-glycerine
hnmh, made hy allowing the explosive
to run up a capillary tube. He ran the
tube through a flame, and short, sharp
reports were given in rapid succession
as the substance became heated.
