LEGE, Corvallis, Dec. 2 (P. I. N. S.) —
Major General W. M. Wright, com
mander of the Ninth Corps Area, and
acting chief of staff in the World War,
who inspected the R. O. T. C. units,
paid a high compliment to the college,
saying it not only has a national repu
tation because of its educational achieve
ments but because of the efficiency of
the military training given. Colonel F.
C. Morrow, head of the R. O. T. C.,
Washington, D. C., told him some time
ago that O. A. C. had the "best and
most representative R. O. T. C." The
college is one of the "distinguished in
stitutions" from a military standpoint.
"Our work in carrying on the R. O.
T. C. units is a work for the future,"
said Major General Wright. "I am not
a militarist, but if I stood here and told
you there would be no more war I'd be
making a fool of myself, so let's be pre
pared for the next war. You are per
forming a very serious work and I am
speaking for the president and the sec
retary of war, and I know they thank
you for it. I firmly believe every man
is a better citizen for having been a
good soldier—for having had military
training.
"The morale of the army is but a re
flection of the people at home. If there
is a high morale at home there is a high
morale in the army. These young men
will have a good influence in their com
munities—will inject a spirit of service."
