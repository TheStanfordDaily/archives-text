# CARD HANDBALL MEN PLAY U.C. TOMORROW
## 
### 
Stanford's handball players will jour
ney to Berkeley tomorrow afternoon to
play the University of California team
in the annual tournament on the box
courts of the Berkeley Y. M. C. A.
The Cardinal and Blue and Gold rep
resentatives will meet in two singles and
two doubles matches.
Lowenstein, Koba and Rutter are the
Stanford entries in the singles, and two
of them will b chosen to play. Lowen
stein has done very little work on the
local courts this year, but has confined
his playing to weekly matches at the
Olympic Club. He is favored to start
in one of the singles because of his win
over his California opponent last year.
Koba, who played on the 135-pound
basketball team last winter, is just as
fast on the handball court as he is on the
basketball floor. Rutter is the winner
of the University championship singles
tournament.
Aaron and Mark Cohen, winners over
California two years ago, will make
their appearance in the doubles after a
year's absence. The other team is as
yet undecided. Colvin has shown to good
advantage in the tryouts and he will be
one of the pair. The other man will be
selected from Lowenstein, Koba, and
Rutter, and will depend upon the show
ings made by these men upon the box
courts at Berkeley.
The tryouts for places on the team
brought tt> light several promising play
ers who could not be considered for to
morrow's tournament because of lack of
practice. H. J. Cornish, Arnold Rum
wcll, and D. S. Atwood are as adept at
the game as any of the veterans. Cor
nish formerly wore the colors of the
Denver Athletic Club, while Rumwell
gained most of his handball experience
at the Olympic Club.
