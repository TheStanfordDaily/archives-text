### 
Encina's last smoker of the autumn
quarter was held in the Encina Club
rooms last night. The committee in
charge, consisting of Art Harzfeld,
chairman, Ward Evans, and Phil Ne
will, furnished an excellent program,
plenty of smokes and good eats. Dur
ing the program, huge barrels of cider
were hauled about the room on small
wagons in order that those present
might not become too "dry."
Throughout the evening, music was
furnished by the Encina orchestra, and
following the program a stag dance was
held.
Norman Nathanson gave several saxa
phone solos which were applauded heart
ily, and he was compelled to respond to
several calls for encores.
The Encina quartet, consisting of Dan
Evans, Reed Nesbit, Eddie Simpson, and
Harley Carter, gave some selections and

they were called back to render en
cores As usual, the freshmen fur
nished their part of the evening's pro
gram by doing various stunts. George
Morse, '23, gave a humorous monologue.
Jimmie Gillen, dressed as a woman, gave
a humorous playlet which brought a
great deal of laughter. George Papa
zian with his mandolin solos proved to
be a decided hit.
