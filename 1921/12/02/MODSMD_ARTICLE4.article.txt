# SOPHOMORE PLAY IS READY FOR CURTAIN
## SHAW'S "YOU NEVER CAN TELL" IS BRILLIANT COMEDY; PERSONNEL INSURES SUCCESS 
### (By MARY JANE CLARK, '22 
The last rehearsal has been held, the last artistic bit of paint has been
applied to scenery, the last "property" is in its place and the Sophomore Play,
"You Never Can Tell" awaits only the rise of the curtain tomorrow even
ing, to present to an expectant campus the crowning event of the 1924 week
end. — -
The combination of a thoroughly capable cast, perfectly staging and a play
which is acclaimed the funniest comedy from the pen of one of the best
liked of modern dramatists —George Bernard Shaw —promises a rare dramatic
achievement and an evening of perfect enjoyment.
As evidence consider the individual members of the cast. Valentine, the
hero of the piece, is in the capable hands of Norris James... He slips easily

into the of the role. As an
aspiring young dentist he is able to
put across an easy off-hand sort of
humor that always carries off the situ
ation. Somehow you just can't down
him. As the sixth victim of Miss
Gloria Clandon he is the perfect in
fatuated swain, and as the dentist he
has all the professional finish and
technique of the real off-stage dentist
of ten years experience.
Opposite him, as the heroine of the
play is Edythe Baylis, as Gloria Clan
don, the Twentieth Century Girl. Miss
Baylis has remarkable poise, and with
a delightful stage voice and an ap
pealing personality she should not
only captivate the ardent Valentine,
but her audience as" well.
One of the principal features of the
play will be the antics of Gloria's
younger brother and sister—Dolly and
Philip Clandon, who are played by
Helen Whitney and John Vaughan.
These two have a natural gift of jump
ing energetically into their parts and
are the incarnation of youthful ex
huberance. Having been reared along
ultra-advanced ideas of individual in
dependence they are self-willed and
obstinate, disrespectful to their eld
ers—nuisances in general. Neverthe
less their deviltry always comes in at
the right moment and they succeed
in being only generally lovable.
Mrs. Clandon, a champion of the
Women's Rights Movement and a di
sciple of advanced thought, the author
of "Twentieth Century Treatises" is
interpreted by Catherine Ulrich. She
is admirably suited to this part, which
she plays with a degree of restraint


A Tooth-Drawing Scene That is Expected to Draw Laughter From Those
Who See "You Never Can Tell"
and dignity that thoroughly individu
alizes the character.
Of the character parts there are
John Richer as the long-lost Mr.
Crampton, and Daniel Gage as the
protesting old ;family solicitor who
play these elderly parts with a
thorough conception of them. Then
there is Samuel Mendenhall as Wil
liam the waiter —one of Shaw's most
well-known characters. Mendenhall
puts into this part all the genial humor
and sympathy possible and makes of
the character one which is truly de
lightful.
In the last act comes the eminent
Mr. Dohun, Q.C., by David
Mannoccir. From the time of his ent
rance, Mannoccir dominates the en
tire scene. He has good stage pres
ence and an admirable speaking
voice. Constance Tamplin, as the
maid has a small part, but makes the
most of the performance of her defer
ential duties in the first act.

and dignity that thoroughly individu
alizes the character.
Of the character parts there are
John Richer as the long-lost Mr.
Crampton, and Daniel Gage as the
protesting old ;family solicitor who
play these elderly parts with a
thorough conception of them. Then
there is Samuel Mendenhall as Wil
liam the waiter —one of Shaw's most
well-known characters. Mendenhall
puts into this part all the genial humor
and sympathy possible and makes of
the character one which is truly de
lightful.
In the last act comes the eminent
Mr. Dohun, Q.C., by David
Mannoccir. From the time of his ent
rance, Mannoccir dominates the en
tire scene. He has good stage pres
ence and an admirable speaking
voice. Constance Tamplin, as the
maid has a small part, but makes the
most of the performance of her defer
ential duties in the first act.
The last rehearsal has been held, the last artistic bit of paint has been
applied to scenery, the last "property" is in its place and the Sophomore Play,
"You Never Can Tell" awaits only the rise of the curtain tomorrow even
ing, to present to an expectant campus the crowning event of the 1924 week
end. — -
The combination of a thoroughly capable cast, perfectly staging and a play
which is acclaimed the funniest comedy from the pen of one of the best
liked of modern dramatists —George Bernard Shaw —promises a rare dramatic
achievement and an evening of perfect enjoyment.
As evidence consider the individual members of the cast. Valentine, the
hero of the piece, is in the capable hands of Norris James... He slips easily

into the of the role. As an
aspiring young dentist he is able to
put across an easy off-hand sort of
humor that always carries off the situ
ation. Somehow you just can't down
him. As the sixth victim of Miss
Gloria Clandon he is the perfect in
fatuated swain, and as the dentist he
has all the professional finish and
technique of the real off-stage dentist
of ten years experience.
Opposite him, as the heroine of the
play is Edythe Baylis, as Gloria Clan
don, the Twentieth Century Girl. Miss
Baylis has remarkable poise, and with
a delightful stage voice and an ap
pealing personality she should not
only captivate the ardent Valentine,
but her audience as" well.
One of the principal features of the
play will be the antics of Gloria's
younger brother and sister—Dolly and
Philip Clandon, who are played by
Helen Whitney and John Vaughan.
These two have a natural gift of jump
ing energetically into their parts and
are the incarnation of youthful ex
huberance. Having been reared along
ultra-advanced ideas of individual in
dependence they are self-willed and
obstinate, disrespectful to their eld
ers—nuisances in general. Neverthe
less their deviltry always comes in at
the right moment and they succeed
in being only generally lovable.
Mrs. Clandon, a champion of the
Women's Rights Movement and a di
sciple of advanced thought, the author
of "Twentieth Century Treatises" is
interpreted by Catherine Ulrich. She
is admirably suited to this part, which
she plays with a degree of restraint
