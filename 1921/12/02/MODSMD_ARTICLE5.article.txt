# STANFORD GOLFERS WILL PLAY U. C. ON BERESFORD COURSE
## Comparative Practice Scores Seem to Give Stanford Players the Edge 
### 
Stanford golfers will meet the Uni
versity of California team in a five-man
tournament on the links of the Beres
ford Country Club tomorrow. Both
squads went over the course in a final
preparation yesterday, and practice
scores gave Stanford the edge for the
contest.
Two matches which are expected to be
closely fought are those between Mil
lard Rosenblatt, Stanford captain, and
Stanley Haight of California; and be
tween B. J. Frankhenheimc.r, Cardinal
player, and Jerry Villain. All of these
men are veterans of last year's meet, in
which both the California players won
their matches. Putnam, of Stanford, has
shown to advantage in trans-bay tourna
ments at the Sequoia Country Club, and
was winner of the Wowona Tourna
ment of the Sierras. Rosenblatt, head
ing the Stanford aggregation, was chosen
as one of the first eight in the northwest
at a tournament in Vancouver, B. C.,
two years ago.
In the other matches, B. J. Franken
heimer, Stanford, will play Walter Glea
son; George Kleiser will meet Ed Ly
man, captain of the Berkeley team; and
L. VV. Miller of Stanford will meet a
California man not yet decided upon.
The Nassau System of scoring is to
be used. This allows a player a three
point score, one for the first nine holes,
one for the second, and a third for the
total eighteen.
