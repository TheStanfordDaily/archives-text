# BIG GAME RECEIPTS TO EXCEED $210,000 MARK
## Returns From Concessions Shows Wisdom of Board in Handling Food and Drinks 
### 
The preliminary estimate of the re
ceipts of the Big Game between Cali
fornia and Stanford in the Stanford
Stadium on Nevember 19, indicates
that each of the universities will re
ceive somewhere between $103,000' and
$105,000. There are still some un
settled items which make it impos
sible to give the exact amounts at this
time.
The total receipts from the game
were somewhere in excess of $210,000,
but the preliminary estimate indicates
that they will not exceed $213,000 at
the outside. The total expenses to
be shared by the two universities in
putting on the game amount to less
than $4,000.
The value of unsold tickets at the
game somewhat exceeds $27,000.
Stanford by itself made a profit of
several thousand dollars on enter
prises connected with the game which
were designed not primarily to make
money but to add to the comfort and
convenience of the crowds. From the
booths which sold various kinds of
foods and drink at as nearly net cost
as possible the final accounts show a
profit of something like $500. The
sale of programs, which were disposed
of at $25 cents a copy, yielded a profit
of more than $3,000.
The Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol this year managed all these en
terprises itself under the direct super
vision of Graduate Manager W. D.
Fletcher instead of following the cus
tom of farming out various conces
sions to individuals. The Board took
this action in order to make sure that
all these enterprises, the primary pur
pose of which is the convenience of
those attending the game, should he
conducted with that purpose always
kept in mind. On this account no
thing was permitted to be offered for
sale within the enclosure of the stadi
um and all the sales outside the en
closure were managed in such a way
as to avoid confusion or difficulty to
ticket holders in reaching the entrance
gates.
