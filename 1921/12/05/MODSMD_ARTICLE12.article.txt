# GALA EFFECT AT 1924 COTILLION
## Sympathetic Lights Merciful to Decorations; Program Design is Impressionistic 
### Hal Rorke, '24 
With even the lights sympathetic Fri
day evening, the sophomore cotillion was
a huge success. Everybody, including
the one person whose corns weren't
crushed under another's heel, realizes
that "huge" is advised. There were
about 250 couples 011 the gymnasium
floor most of the time. The decoration,
although announced under the formida
ble title "impressionistic," turned out to
be very effective. As fuel the drapes
were fortunately not so good, and the
tire caused by the flashlight was prompt
ly put out.
The long, low ceiling of orange, white
and deep violet stripes gave an appear
ance of considerable length to the floor.
At the ends, green and yellow paper
was hung in relief to the violet and
patchwork side-walls. Whether it was
the dim richness of the lights or the
blend of the colors themselves, the ef
fect of the combination was well bal
anced and satisfying. Considering the
fact that the whole plan of decorating
had to be changed two days before be
cause enough cloth could not be ob
tained in San Francisco to carry out
the original scheme, Ernest Greppin,
who had this in charge, deserves com
mendation as an emergency worker.
The program was the only feature of
the party which could properly be called
impressionistic. The design suggested
a tour of the campus marking the pro
gram as standing for Stanford. The
central figure showed the embodiment
of the class striding among familiar to
kens of the campus. Red-roofed arches,
the cactus and geranium hedges, the
dink underfoot, the stadium and the like
were pictured round about, in a general
way suggesting the progress of the
walker.
One feature of the evening which
compared in novelty to the program was
Bachelor's eight-piece orchestra. The
Berkeley pianist's octette did things to
the stock melodies which kept sympa
thetic lights in a nervous flicker. It was
something new for the "harm.
Refreshments had the tang of variety,
too. Not too elaborate, the. non-dupli-
cated ice cream figures were shortly dis
posed of and the main business of the
evening was delayed but shortly.
Chairman John Richer pronounced the
evening a success as far as the financial
end was concerned. He estimates that
several hundred dollars was made by
the class. Tickets for the dance were
disposed of almost immediately after
being put on sale, and unlike last year's
cotillion, almost universally stood for a
cash return.
Headed by John Richer, the committee
was made up of Robert Nourse, refresh
ments ; Ernest Greppin, A1 Lowenstein,
Alice Roth, Helen Whitney, Christine
McFarlane, and Eunice Biddle, decora
tions; Lester Dills, publicity; Orion
Clark, Fred Ludeke, properties; Willis
Bennett, financial.
