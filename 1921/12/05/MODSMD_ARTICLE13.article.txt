# Polo Teams to Clash in Last of Series Matches
## 
### 
The last match of the finals of the
polo tournament will be played this aft
ernoon, when the Whites meet the Reds,
and the Blues play the Browns. In a
practice game on Friday, with only three
men on each side, the Brown squad held
the Blues to a tic. This was partly due,
however, to the wet field. The Brown
team will lie crippled tomorrow by the
loss of Worden's spectacular riding. His
place is expected to he taken by Drys
dale. The Whites, rated as the. crack
team of the campus, will go into the
match against the Reds with "a two
handicap to overcome, and the heady
playing of Major Collins to block.
