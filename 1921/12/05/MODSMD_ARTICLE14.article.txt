# STANFORD TEAM LOSES TO GOLD, BLUE DEBATERS
## Contest Marked by Excellent Delivery and Clear Thinking; Teams Match Evenly 
### Worth W. Caldwell, '24 
The Stanford varsity debating team
went down to defeat, by a unanimouH
decision of the judges, in the annual
forensic contest with the University
of California, on the question "Resolv
ed, That Congress Should Pass a Law
Exempting American Coastwise Ship
ping from Payment of Panama Canal
lolls."
The arguments on both sides were
presented in a clear-cut and definite
manner. The one-rebuttal system,
which made its debut in this contest,

well-balanced, well- coached Stanford
team.
Matthew Tobriner ,'24. opened the
debate for the Cardinals in an eager
and enthusiastic manner. However,
his voice was pitched a little too high,
and that detracted somewhat from his
otherwise excellent talk. Richard Jen
kins, '25, the second Stanford man to
take the floor, was held in a rather
peculiar position. His chief function
was to elaborate upon the principles
first stated by Tobriner and this fact
tended to make his speech less sensa
tional than it otherwise might have
been. He spoke slowly and deliber
ately, but with a force and polish ouite
contrary to that shown by his col
league. Knox Miller, '23, the final
speaker for the affirmative and also
the rebuttal speaker, displayed an all
round ability and professional-like
finish which made his work remark
able. Considering him from all angles,
