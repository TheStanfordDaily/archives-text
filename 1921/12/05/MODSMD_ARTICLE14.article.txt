# STANFORD TEAM LOSES TO GOLD, BLUE DEBATERS
## Contest Marked by Excellent Delivery and Clear Thinking; Teams Match Evenly 
### Worth W. Caldwell, '24 
The Stanford varsity debating team
went down to defeat, by a unanimouH
decision of the judges, in the annual
forensic contest with the University
of California, on the question "Resolv
ed, That Congress Should Pass a Law
Exempting American Coastwise Ship
ping from Payment of Panama Canal
lolls."
The arguments on both sides were
presented in a clear-cut and definite
manner. The one-rebuttal system,
which made its debut in this contest,
seemed to give sufficient promise to
warrant its employment more often in
the future. Stanford undoubtedly led
in the form and delivery of the vari
ous affirmative arguments. On the
other hand, California excelled in
logic and in the construction of an
almost unbreakable chain of reason
ing. To this, the Bruin debaters owe
their success in triumph over a strong,
well-balanced, well- coached Stanford
team.
Matthew Tobriner ,'24. opened the
debate for the Cardinals in an eager
and enthusiastic manner. However,
his voice was pitched a little too high,
and that detracted somewhat from his
otherwise excellent talk. Richard Jen
kins, '25, the second Stanford man to
take the floor, was held in a rather
peculiar position. His chief function
was to elaborate upon the principles
first stated by Tobriner and this fact
tended to make his speech less sensa
tional than it otherwise might have
been. He spoke slowly and deliber
ately, but with a force and polish ouite
contrary to that shown by his col
league. Knox Miller, '23, the final
speaker for the affirmative and also
the rebuttal speaker, displayed an all
round ability and professional-like
finish which made his work remark
able. Considering him from all angles,
every requisite of an excellent debater
seems to be embodied in his technique.
Miss Olive Pressler, prominent ad
ministrator of women's affairs at Cali
fornia, was the first speaker for the
Blue and Gold. Her arguments were
good, cleverly arranged, and her man
ner of delivery was pleasing at all
times. But she lacked the vigor and
force that is so indispensable in a
contest of this kind. Paul Murphy,
the second member of the Berkeley
trio, devoted practically his entire
speech to rebuttal. He adopted an
extremely conversational attitude in
his delivery and put all his facts over
well. Murphy is often referred to as
California's best debater. His appear
ance on the Stanford campus this
week-end was not his initial one here
as he participated in the Joffre debate
last year. Robert Bohnet was the
final speaker on the negative. He is
the president of the California Debat
ing Council and prominent at the uni
versity across the bay in public speak
ing and debating. He achieved some
very fine climaxes in the course of his
talk, and, although his delivery was
not particularly effective, he made a
very go?Sd showing.
The judges for this debate, who are
all prominent men in public life, in
cluded Archbishop Hanna of San Fran
cisco; Percy Long, San Francisco at
torney; and the president of St. Pat
rick's Seminary, at Menlo Park. Pro
fessor A. M. Cathcart of the Law de
partment acted as the chairman of the
evening.

all prominent men in public life, in
cluded Archbishop Hanna of San Fran
cisco; Percy Long, San Francisco at
torney; and the president of St. Pat
rick's Seminary, at Menlo Park. Pro
fessor A. M. Cathcart of the Law de
partment acted as the chairman of the
evening.
The Stanford varsity debating team
went down to defeat, by a unanimouH
decision of the judges, in the annual
forensic contest with the University
of California, on the question "Resolv
ed, That Congress Should Pass a Law
Exempting American Coastwise Ship
ping from Payment of Panama Canal
lolls."
The arguments on both sides were
presented in a clear-cut and definite
manner. The one-rebuttal system,
which made its debut in this contest,
seemed to give sufficient promise to
warrant its employment more often in
the future. Stanford undoubtedly led
in the form and delivery of the vari
ous affirmative arguments. On the
other hand, California excelled in
logic and in the construction of an
almost unbreakable chain of reason
ing. To this, the Bruin debaters owe
their success in triumph over a strong,
well-balanced, well- coached Stanford
team.
Matthew Tobriner ,'24. opened the
debate for the Cardinals in an eager
and enthusiastic manner. However,
his voice was pitched a little too high,
and that detracted somewhat from his
otherwise excellent talk. Richard Jen
kins, '25, the second Stanford man to
take the floor, was held in a rather
peculiar position. His chief function
was to elaborate upon the principles
first stated by Tobriner and this fact
tended to make his speech less sensa
tional than it otherwise might have
been. He spoke slowly and deliber
ately, but with a force and polish ouite
contrary to that shown by his col
league. Knox Miller, '23, the final
speaker for the affirmative and also
the rebuttal speaker, displayed an all
round ability and professional-like
finish which made his work remark
able. Considering him from all angles,
every requisite of an excellent debater
seems to be embodied in his technique.
Miss Olive Pressler, prominent ad
ministrator of women's affairs at Cali
fornia, was the first speaker for the
Blue and Gold. Her arguments were
good, cleverly arranged, and her man
ner of delivery was pleasing at all
times. But she lacked the vigor and
force that is so indispensable in a
contest of this kind. Paul Murphy,
the second member of the Berkeley
trio, devoted practically his entire
speech to rebuttal. He adopted an
extremely conversational attitude in
his delivery and put all his facts over
well. Murphy is often referred to as
California's best debater. His appear
ance on the Stanford campus this
week-end was not his initial one here
as he participated in the Joffre debate
last year. Robert Bohnet was the
final speaker on the negative. He is
the president of the California Debat
ing Council and prominent at the uni
versity across the bay in public speak
ing and debating. He achieved some
very fine climaxes in the course of his
talk, and, although his delivery was
not particularly effective, he made a
very go?Sd showing.
