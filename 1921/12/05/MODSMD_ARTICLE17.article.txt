# A 						Neglected Activity
## 
### 
The evening drew toward the close. For two
hours the contest had been waging. In a battle
which was hot and whose thrills had animated the
audience more than once, the representatives of
Stanford and California had met. Masterfully,
each had striven for the advantage; now, the result
of the contest was to be acclaimed. All eyes turned
to the tellers. The spokesman arose.
"We find," he said, "the decision unanimously in
favor of the negative."
Thus ended another Stanford-California intercol
legiate debate. Undauntedly, the Cardinal debaters
had maintained a question which from the first had
been regarded as untenable. They had done their
best. They met honorable defeat.
A swarm of people mounted the stairs to the stage
to congratulate the victors, and to pay tribute to
the ability of the unsuccessful contestants, whose
worthy fight commanded admiration. The swarm
passed on. and as the auditorium gradually emptied,
there came a feeling that something was wrong
In all that crowd, in all the great number that
swarmed upon the stage, there was one thing notice
able, and that thing was that there were scarcely
any Stanford undergraduates in the hall, and that
barely a dozen came upon the stage to tell the men
who had fought for the Cardinal that they had done
well.
Debating is less spectacular than an athletic con
test. There is not that frenzied appeal that comes
from the sight of human meeting human in an en
deavor for physical supremacy. Yet the battle where
mind meets mind, where one man pits his quickness
of thought and the coordination of memory and
speech against those of another has its moments of
suspense; of animation, of strategy, as well as the
contest upon the athletic field. It has its rules and
penalties, even as a football game or a baseball game.
It requires time and patience and ability to become
a good debater, just as it requires time and patience
and ability to become a good athlete.
The reputation of a university whose debating
teams are uniformly successful is furthered, just as
it is furthered by a good athletic team. If in one
case the degree it is advanced seems greater than
in the other, it is simply a matter of the relative
importance attached to the activities by the college
students. Debating may seem trivial, but the af
fairs of the world hinge upon the debaters of the
world.
There is no collegiate activity, with the possible
exception of journalism, that has more practical
value than debating; and those who show their in
terest in debating through their attendance at fo
rensic contests, if nothing else, will be given a better
view of the problems and the questions which are
confronting people in the world, . . . problems
the like of which all students will be called upon
to solve in after-college days.
In the next quarter, there will be another chance
to show interest in debating. Let us remember
that it is a worth-while activity and let us remember
that our debaters are not representing themselves,
but are representing Stanford in these contests, (iive
debating the support that it deserves, and do not let
people think that Stanford students are not inter
ested in the achievements of those who represent
the Cardinal because of a lack of attendance at the
debates which may be held, I- T. D.

best. They met honorable defeat.
A swarm of people mounted the stairs to the stage
to congratulate the victors, and to pay tribute to
the ability of the unsuccessful contestants, whose
worthy fight commanded admiration. The swarm
passed on. and as the auditorium gradually emptied,
there came a feeling that something was wrong
In all that crowd, in all the great number that
swarmed upon the stage, there was one thing notice
able, and that thing was that there were scarcely
any Stanford undergraduates in the hall, and that
barely a dozen came upon the stage to tell the men
who had fought for the Cardinal that they had done
well.
Debating is less spectacular than an athletic con
test. There is not that frenzied appeal that comes
from the sight of human meeting human in an en
deavor for physical supremacy. Yet the battle where
mind meets mind, where one man pits his quickness
of thought and the coordination of memory and
speech against those of another has its moments of
suspense; of animation, of strategy, as well as the
contest upon the athletic field. It has its rules and
penalties, even as a football game or a baseball game.
It requires time and patience and ability to become
a good debater, just as it requires time and patience
and ability to become a good athlete.
The reputation of a university whose debating
teams are uniformly successful is furthered, just as
it is furthered by a good athletic team. If in one
case the degree it is advanced seems greater than
in the other, it is simply a matter of the relative
importance attached to the activities by the college
students. Debating may seem trivial, but the af
fairs of the world hinge upon the debaters of the
world.
There is no collegiate activity, with the possible
exception of journalism, that has more practical
value than debating; and those who show their in
terest in debating through their attendance at fo
rensic contests, if nothing else, will be given a better
view of the problems and the questions which are
confronting people in the world, . . . problems
the like of which all students will be called upon
to solve in after-college days.
In the next quarter, there will be another chance
to show interest in debating. Let us remember
that it is a worth-while activity and let us remember
that our debaters are not representing themselves,
but are representing Stanford in these contests, (iive
debating the support that it deserves, and do not let
people think that Stanford students are not inter
ested in the achievements of those who represent
the Cardinal because of a lack of attendance at the
debates which may be held, I- T. D.
The evening drew toward the close. For two
hours the contest had been waging. In a battle
which was hot and whose thrills had animated the
audience more than once, the representatives of
Stanford and California had met. Masterfully,
each had striven for the advantage; now, the result
of the contest was to be acclaimed. All eyes turned
to the tellers. The spokesman arose.
"We find," he said, "the decision unanimously in
favor of the negative."
Thus ended another Stanford-California intercol
legiate debate. Undauntedly, the Cardinal debaters
had maintained a question which from the first had
been regarded as untenable. They had done their
best. They met honorable defeat.
