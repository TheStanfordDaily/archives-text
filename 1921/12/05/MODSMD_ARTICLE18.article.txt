# A 						Coveted Scholarship
## 
### 
Further proof of the high scholarship standard
here is given in the appointment of a Stanford stu
dent as the Rhodes scholar from California, for the
second time in two years. Competition for the ap
pointment to the Rhodes Scholarship is state-wide
and very intense. Every university in the state has
one or more candidates for the honor. The appli
cants are judged on three counts, strength of char
acter, scholastic standing, and athletic ability.
Appointment to the scholarship is made by a
board on which there are some former Rhodes

scholars. The award entitles the successful candi
date to three years in Oxford University in Eng
land, with an emolument of Â£350 annually.
Obviously a man who meets the requirements of
the successful Rhodes scholar must be of the highest
moral and intellectual character.
The appointment of a Stanford student as the
Rhodes scholar to Oxford for the second time in
two years is but another recognition of the high
standard of education and training that is acquired
here.
