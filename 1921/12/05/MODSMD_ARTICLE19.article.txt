This all-star selection of watermelon chasers that is
going on all over the country has gone to Cabbages'
head. Why is it? And who? ir you're going to make
a really all-star selection, take nothing but the best.
For instance —
« » »
The following all-moon Kabbage line-up is the best
in the country. Everey man's a cheese. Joshibe is re
sponsible for many of the ideas contained below.
* * *
Center —Walt (Gasoline Alley College).
Right guard—Captain Katzenjammer (Pinochle Uni
versity).
Left guard—Mrs. Katzenjammer (Same).
Right tacke —Boob McNutt (Goldberg Institute).
Left Tackle —Barney Google (College of Hard
Knocks).
Right end —Andy Gump (Min University).
Left End —Mutt (Spivis College).
Quarterback —Krazy Kat (Feline Institute of Mouse
Technique).
Left half —Jeff (Also of Spivis College).
Right half —Maud (The Mule with the Boot).
* * «
Notice the way each player fits into his position. The
center is good and heavy. Both guards are used to
being on the lookout every day in the year, including
Armistice Day, and the Fall of the Bastile.
* * *
The tackles are foolish enough to tackle anything.
The ends —oh. Aunt Mariah, but they're fast! And
when they hit, they hit hard. Ask Chester and Jeff,
they know.
* * *
For a quarter there can't be a better selection than
Krazy. He also keeps his head in a cool dry place
it's never with him. The half backs don't care at all
for a heavy line —they string one themselves.
♦ ♦ *
And for kicking power, even Brick Morse must ad
mit that Nisbet, Morrisan and Witter combined would
stand a poor show against Maud, the mule with the' edu
cated hoof.
* * *
We haven't mentioned a coach or water-boy. There
are some things that even Cabbages is not capable tc
handle.
* * »
Fair co-ed (blonde) requests that we start a "favored'
few" section, containing the deep jokes and high-brow
stuff that doesn't get over to the multitude. Why, we
ask, should we do that as long as Friday keeps on the
job.
* * •
But it's a good suggestion. Jokes liJie the prof pullfc;
in Philosophy lor Geography 45y 2 should go in that:
section.
• m •
* * *
After all that trouble they're been having over aiv
East vs. West game, it seems that now is the time
to submit a few more good suggestions. Such as:
* * *
Heinze Pickle Works vs. Libby McNeil & Libby_
Neither of these are distinctly East and West, so it
ought to be a good game. Nobody's feelings will be
hurt if the game ends in a tie.
* • *
Long Island Car Conductors vs. Pal® Alto Motormen..
We're betting on the latter. They may not be so fast,,
but their line is held up better (or more).
« * *
West Virginia Gooseneck Point School for Overbed;
Invalids vs. Oscar Wow-wow Military Academy, M&nlOi.
The former bunch have not lost a game yet this sea 1 -
son. The latter team has not started playing yet.
* ♦ »
Stevedores' Local No. 999 vs. Stevedores' Local H3".. A
bang-up battle. Both elevens know how to strike- withi
effect, and their line would stop anybody, where they
get the old vocal chords loosened up.
• w «
WAR! WAR!! WAR!!!—Is hereby declared; on the
guy who insinuates that we steal anything frcicn Tues
day, Wednesday. Thursday, or Friday.
* • •
"THAT'S AWL," SAID THE CARPENTER. "THAT'S
PLANE," REMARKED HIS MATE.

This all-star selection of watermelon chasers that is
going on all over the country has gone to Cabbages'
head. Why is it? And who? ir you're going to make
a really all-star selection, take nothing but the best.
For instance —
« » »
The following all-moon Kabbage line-up is the best
in the country. Everey man's a cheese. Joshibe is re
sponsible for many of the ideas contained below.
* * *
Center —Walt (Gasoline Alley College).
Right guard—Captain Katzenjammer (Pinochle Uni
versity).
Left guard—Mrs. Katzenjammer (Same).
Right tacke —Boob McNutt (Goldberg Institute).
Left Tackle —Barney Google (College of Hard
Knocks).
Right end —Andy Gump (Min University).
Left End —Mutt (Spivis College).
Quarterback —Krazy Kat (Feline Institute of Mouse
Technique).
Left half —Jeff (Also of Spivis College).
Right half —Maud (The Mule with the Boot).
* * «
Notice the way each player fits into his position. The
center is good and heavy. Both guards are used to
being on the lookout every day in the year, including
Armistice Day, and the Fall of the Bastile.
* * *
The tackles are foolish enough to tackle anything.
The ends —oh. Aunt Mariah, but they're fast! And
when they hit, they hit hard. Ask Chester and Jeff,
they know.
* * *
For a quarter there can't be a better selection than
Krazy. He also keeps his head in a cool dry place
it's never with him. The half backs don't care at all
for a heavy line —they string one themselves.
♦ ♦ *
And for kicking power, even Brick Morse must ad
mit that Nisbet, Morrisan and Witter combined would
stand a poor show against Maud, the mule with the' edu
cated hoof.
* * *
We haven't mentioned a coach or water-boy. There
are some things that even Cabbages is not capable tc
handle.
