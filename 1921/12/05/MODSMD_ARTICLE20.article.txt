# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
The important questions which are
engrossing public interest this week
are the proposed understanding be
tween the United States, Great Bri
tain, France and Japan; the Chinese
demands; and the Irish question.
THE FOUR-POWER AGREEMENT
The proposed four-power alliance is
to be based on a declaration of prin
ciple and not on treaties. The import
ant features are the adoption of the
5-5-3 naval ratio for the United States,
Great Britain and Japan, a guar
antee of the integrity of the Pacific
possessions of the participating na
tions, scrapping of the Anglo-
Japanese Alliances, and non-fortifica
tion of the Pacific Island possessions.
This proposal will be submitted to
,Tokio by the Japanese delegates this
week, and until their reply is receiv
ed the conference will practically
suspend work.
.CHINA'S DEMANDS
The demands of China have been
hiet in part by the agreement of Eng
land, France and Japan to relinquish
certain leased territories. Japan has
agreed to give up a part of the Shan
tung lease, but not Port Arthur nor
jDaireu. England will give up Wei
hauvai, but not Kowloon; and France
will give up Kwangehan if the other
powers will relinquish their lease
holds. The terms on which these
'restorations will be made have not
been published and the Chinese are
not particularly satisfid with the of
fers.
IRELAND'S SITUATION
The Irish situation is again serious.
News is uncertain, but the' Sinn Fein
delegates are reported to have refused
the British offer bcause of the allegi
ance clauses and the fact that Ulster
would remain outside the scheme.
The government is understood to
liave refused the Sinn Fein counter
proposals and to have declared that it
will make no further concessions.
GERMAN FTNANCES
The efforts in Germany and in Great
Britain to re-establish Germany com
mercially and enable her to meet her
obligations are arousing considerable
interest in financial circles. For this
purpose a three-year moratorium lias
been proposed and there may be an
attempt to float small loans and formi
a consortium to finance the industries.
