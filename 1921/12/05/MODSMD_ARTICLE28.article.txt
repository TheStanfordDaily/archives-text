# SIGMA CHI TAKES MEASURE OF DELTA TAU DELTA QUINTET
## 
### 
A two-point lead enabled the Sigma
Chi quintet to take a basketball victory
from Delta Tau Delta this morning, the
final score being 11 to 9.
The usual winning combination of
better teamwork in passing and more ac
curate basket shooting gave Sigma Chi
the edge in playing. Cleveland threw
nine points of the eleven total. Meeken
and MacCrorie, forward and center, kept
the ball in their opponents' territory, but
played faster than they could handle the
ball. At the end of the first half, they
had established their two-point lead, 6
to 4.
Delta Tau Delta's men played a de
fensive, individual game. The final
score, might easily have been reversed if
they had possessed slightly more team
work, which no doubt will be acquired
by additional practice.
Hereafter, a standing broad-jump con
test will be held before the basketball
games, the purpose being to discover
the best jumpers, besides offering a pre
liminary warming-up event.
