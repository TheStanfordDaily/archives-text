# EUROPEAN FUND TO BE ASSEMBLY TOPIC
## Dr. Alonzo Taylor, Dr. Anna Cox Brenton Will Tell of Needs of Foreign Colleges 
### 
To prepare the way for the European
Student Fund campaign, which will be
held on the campus this week, and to
acquaint the student body with the con
ditions and circumstances which make
it so urgently necessary, comes the as
sembly which has been announced for
10 o'clock on Wednesday morning.
President Wilbur will preside, Dr. Alon
zo Taylor of the Food Research Insti
tute at Stanford, and Dr. Anna Cox
Brinton, Stanford. '09, professor of
Greek Latin at Mills College, will
tell from intimate experience of the con
ditions existing in the involved terri
tory, while Dan Evans, '21, student body
president, will represent the student at
titude in relation to the coming cam
paign.
Dr. AlonzQ Taylor has four times sur
veyed Eastern and Central Europe to
form a basis for the work of the Ameri
can Relief Administration. The A. R.
A. is one of three organizations engaged
in giving material aid to the suffering
student classes, the others being the. So
ciety of Friends and the World's Stu
dent Christian Federation, under which
latter this European student fund is be
ing raised. Although relief to the "In
telligensia" is only a branch of the A.
R. A., whose efforts are devoted mainly
along the lines of child welfare, it ad
ministers together with the Friends, to
both students and faculty, while this
drive reaches only students, both in con
tribution and distribution. Dr. Tayloi
made his last survey, covering Germany,
Austria, Poland, and surrounding coun
tries, in May, and will make as the
basis of his talk the condition in the
university centers as they existed at this
recent date.
Having bee.n for over a year con
nected with active relief work in Eu
rope, Dr. Anna Brinton will be able to
tell of the actual service rendered in
the stricken areas. Dr. Brinton draws
her experience from two sources, hav
ing been first with the Society of Friends
in Germany and later in Poland, under
the American Relief Administration.
The campaign on the campus, carried
out under the direction of Professor
Fairclough, will not attempt to solicit
more than an average of $1 from each
student. Since the money raised is not
used to send the students through col
lege, this they do themselves by engag
ing in every available employement, but
in ekeing out their barren existence with
food and clothing supplies, opportuni
ties for self-help, and the maintenance
of and co-operation with existing stu
dent hostels, a relatively small but uni
versal contribution will prove immensely
effective. And counting for fully as
much as the material aid given is the
expression of encouragement and friend
liness which is one of the chief fea
tures of international student relief.
Captains for the drive have been
appointed from several living groups
and are to meet with him Tuesday
afternoon, at 5:30, in Room 12, of the
Law Department. The students se
