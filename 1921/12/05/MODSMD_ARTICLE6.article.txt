# SHOW PLAY IS VEHICLE FOR CLEVER CAST WORK
## "You Never Can Tell" Succeeds Through Artistic Presentation 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
"You Never Can Tell," was a George
Bernard Shaw comedy, well done â€”
which implies much. For the success
of a Shaw play depends not so much
011 unusual plot or rapid action, but
upon the ability of a cast to appreciate
and put across every bit of humor and
every fine point of characterization
provided by the dramatist. It was
finished, intelligent acting which held
the interest of the audience, especially
in an otherwise rather slow and
lengthy third act, Saturday evening.
The comedy was a distinct de
parture from the usual type of Sopho
more dramatic offering and congratula
tions are accordingly due the Sopho
more Class for producing a Shaw play
successfully, and for introducing to us
a group of unusually promising actors.
No more fortunate casting could
have been made, and the thoroughness
with which the parts were handled is
a tribute to the direction of Gordon
Davis. Several slips were there, of
course, and at times a character would
betray the amateur, but discounting
these, the work of the cast was de
cidedly far above the average.
For instance, there was Norris
James in the leading part as Valen

tine, the aspiring dentist, whose love
affair with Gloria, a very modern
young lady, formed half the plot. The
young professional man was ably im
personated. James, at times, took
himself too seriously, but for the most
part gave a clear-cut characterization
of the affable, care-free, self-possessed
young theorist and carried off his situ
ations with marked familiarity with
stage technique.
Edythe Baylis had a part which did
not offer too much opportunity for dis
playing a delightful stage personality
and a lovely speaking voice. She
played Gloria, the twentieth century
girl who tries to follow her mother's
advanced-thought theories, with a
poise that indicated excellent sense
of dramatic values, and her work was
especially appealing in the scene with
her father. Miss Baylis' acting left
nothing to be desired. She was al
together captivating as the charming
heroine.
Undoubtedly the stars of the even
ing were Helen Whitney and John j
Vaughan as Dolly and Philip Clandon, |
the incorrigible twins from the Island !
of Madeira. This bright constellation j
enlivened and electrified the entire
