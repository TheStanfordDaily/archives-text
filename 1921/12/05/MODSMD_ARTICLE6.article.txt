# SHOW PLAY IS VEHICLE FOR CLEVER CAST WORK
## "You Never Can Tell" Succeeds Through Artistic Presentation 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
"You Never Can Tell," was a George
Bernard Shaw comedy, well done —
which implies much. For the success
of a Shaw play depends not so much
011 unusual plot or rapid action, but
upon the ability of a cast to appreciate
and put across every bit of humor and
every fine point of characterization
provided by the dramatist. It was
finished, intelligent acting which held
the interest of the audience, especially
in an otherwise rather slow and
lengthy third act, Saturday evening.
The comedy was a distinct de
parture from the usual type of Sopho
more dramatic offering and congratula
tions are accordingly due the Sopho
more Class for producing a Shaw play
successfully, and for introducing to us
a group of unusually promising actors.
No more fortunate casting could
have been made, and the thoroughness
with which the parts were handled is
a tribute to the direction of Gordon
Davis. Several slips were there, of
course, and at times a character would
betray the amateur, but discounting
these, the work of the cast was de
cidedly far above the average.
For instance, there was Norris
James in the leading part as Valen

tine, the aspiring dentist, whose love
affair with Gloria, a very modern
young lady, formed half the plot. The
young professional man was ably im
personated. James, at times, took
himself too seriously, but for the most
part gave a clear-cut characterization
of the affable, care-free, self-possessed
young theorist and carried off his situ
ations with marked familiarity with
stage technique.
Edythe Baylis had a part which did
not offer too much opportunity for dis
playing a delightful stage personality
and a lovely speaking voice. She
played Gloria, the twentieth century
girl who tries to follow her mother's
advanced-thought theories, with a
poise that indicated excellent sense
of dramatic values, and her work was
especially appealing in the scene with
her father. Miss Baylis' acting left
nothing to be desired. She was al
together captivating as the charming
heroine.
Undoubtedly the stars of the even
ing were Helen Whitney and John j
Vaughan as Dolly and Philip Clandon, |
the incorrigible twins from the Island !
of Madeira. This bright constellation j
enlivened and electrified the entire
play. They were completely at home
in their parts from beginning to end,
always appearing at the opportune mo
ment with some fresh bit of deviltry.
Miss Whitney was a positive joy. Not
only does she know how to act, but
she has a roguish personality which
captured her audience at her first ap
pearance. John Vaughan, the pre-po
sessing brother, with his impressive
conclusions based on his "knowledge
of human nature" took his part with
assurance and his performance was
satisfying in every respect. Both
showed marked talent.
The best piece of character work
was contributed by Sam Mendenhall
as William, the waiter at the sea
side hotel. William is a delightful old
character, a philosopher, "the most
tactful of men." Mendenhall slipped
into this part with more than ordinary
ability, appreciating its comedy values
and ending by installing himself in
the regard of all the characters and
in the sympathy of his audience as
well.
In the other division of the plot—
the complications of tlje Crampton
household —there were Katherine Ul
lich as Mrs. Clandon, the author of
'Twentieth Century Treatises' and her
estranged husband, Fergus Crampton,
played by John Richer. Miss Ulrich
was the dignified matron, which she
played with admirable restraint. She
thoroughly understood her part, but
her interpretation tended to become
somewhat monotonous and colorless.
Richer competently handled the diffi
culties of his role as the irascible
father, deprived of his children for
eighteen years. Although his acting
seemed a trifle insecure in the begin
ning, his characterization became so
convincing that towards the close of
the play one's sympathies instinctively
went out to the disagreeable old man,
longing for the affection of his chil
dren and shocked by their indiffer
ence. It was clever character work.
Daniel Gage, in the role of Mc-
Comas, the family solicitor, displayed
a sense of comedy demands and com
bined an effective speaking voice with
an impressive personality. Desjtite
a few lapses in characterization his
work was consistently good.
The Mr. Bohun, Q.C., of David Man
noccir, was a definite success. As the
eminent barrister who is called to ef
fect adjustments in the last act, Man
nocclr was the dominant force in the
entire scene. An excellent voice was
a distinct asset to his vigorous charac
terization.
The Scenic work was most interest
ing and the audience S was immediately
responsivee to the beauty of the vari
ous sets, particularly those of the ex
terior and interior of the Marine Ho
tel. Attractive costumes combined to
carry out the general artistic effect.

satisfying in every respect. Both
showed marked talent.
The best piece of character work
was contributed by Sam Mendenhall
as William, the waiter at the sea
side hotel. William is a delightful old
character, a philosopher, "the most
tactful of men." Mendenhall slipped
into this part with more than ordinary
ability, appreciating its comedy values
and ending by installing himself in
the regard of all the characters and
in the sympathy of his audience as
well.
In the other division of the plot—
the complications of tlje Crampton
household —there were Katherine Ul
lich as Mrs. Clandon, the author of
'Twentieth Century Treatises' and her
estranged husband, Fergus Crampton,
played by John Richer. Miss Ulrich
was the dignified matron, which she
played with admirable restraint. She
thoroughly understood her part, but
her interpretation tended to become
somewhat monotonous and colorless.
Richer competently handled the diffi
culties of his role as the irascible
father, deprived of his children for
eighteen years. Although his acting
seemed a trifle insecure in the begin
ning, his characterization became so
convincing that towards the close of
the play one's sympathies instinctively
went out to the disagreeable old man,
longing for the affection of his chil
dren and shocked by their indiffer
ence. It was clever character work.
Daniel Gage, in the role of Mc-
Comas, the family solicitor, displayed
a sense of comedy demands and com
bined an effective speaking voice with
an impressive personality. Desjtite
a few lapses in characterization his
work was consistently good.
The Mr. Bohun, Q.C., of David Man
noccir, was a definite success. As the
eminent barrister who is called to ef
fect adjustments in the last act, Man
nocclr was the dominant force in the
entire scene. An excellent voice was
a distinct asset to his vigorous charac
terization.
The Scenic work was most interest
ing and the audience S was immediately
responsivee to the beauty of the vari
ous sets, particularly those of the ex
terior and interior of the Marine Ho
tel. Attractive costumes combined to
carry out the general artistic effect.
"You Never Can Tell," was a George
Bernard Shaw comedy, well done —
which implies much. For the success
of a Shaw play depends not so much
011 unusual plot or rapid action, but
upon the ability of a cast to appreciate
and put across every bit of humor and
every fine point of characterization
provided by the dramatist. It was
finished, intelligent acting which held
the interest of the audience, especially
in an otherwise rather slow and
lengthy third act, Saturday evening.
The comedy was a distinct de
parture from the usual type of Sopho
more dramatic offering and congratula
tions are accordingly due the Sopho
more Class for producing a Shaw play
successfully, and for introducing to us
a group of unusually promising actors.
No more fortunate casting could
have been made, and the thoroughness
with which the parts were handled is
a tribute to the direction of Gordon
Davis. Several slips were there, of
course, and at times a character would
betray the amateur, but discounting
these, the work of the cast was de
cidedly far above the average.
For instance, there was Norris
James in the leading part as Valen

tine, the aspiring dentist, whose love
affair with Gloria, a very modern
young lady, formed half the plot. The
young professional man was ably im
personated. James, at times, took
himself too seriously, but for the most
part gave a clear-cut characterization
of the affable, care-free, self-possessed
young theorist and carried off his situ
ations with marked familiarity with
stage technique.
Edythe Baylis had a part which did
not offer too much opportunity for dis
playing a delightful stage personality
and a lovely speaking voice. She
played Gloria, the twentieth century
girl who tries to follow her mother's
advanced-thought theories, with a
poise that indicated excellent sense
of dramatic values, and her work was
especially appealing in the scene with
her father. Miss Baylis' acting left
nothing to be desired. She was al
together captivating as the charming
heroine.
Undoubtedly the stars of the even
ing were Helen Whitney and John j
Vaughan as Dolly and Philip Clandon, |
the incorrigible twins from the Island !
of Madeira. This bright constellation j
enlivened and electrified the entire
play. They were completely at home
in their parts from beginning to end,
always appearing at the opportune mo
ment with some fresh bit of deviltry.
Miss Whitney was a positive joy. Not
only does she know how to act, but
she has a roguish personality which
captured her audience at her first ap
pearance. John Vaughan, the pre-po
sessing brother, with his impressive
conclusions based on his "knowledge
of human nature" took his part with
assurance and his performance was
satisfying in every respect. Both
showed marked talent.
