# WORK IS BEGUN ON HIGH DUG TOWER IN LAKE LAGEINITA
## 
### 
Work oil a high-diving tower, located
near the men's boathouse in Lake La
gunita, has been begun under the direc
tion of Ernst Brandsten. The structure,
when completed, will be the finest in the
world, aquatic experts declare, not even
excepting the tower at the Olympic
games in Antwerp.
Plans for the tower were drawn up by
Brandsten and Clarence Pinkston, cham
pion diver of the world. Three plat
forms will be erected at standard heights
to comply with the international high
dive regulations.
The first platform will be. three feet
above the water, 12x19 feet in dimen
sions, and will have a projecting spring
board. Sixteen feet will be the middle
height, and the platform there will be
12x21 feet. The top of the tower, which
will be 27 feet above the water, will
have a surface 12x24 feet.
When the lake is full, the water sur
rounding the diving tower will be 15
feet in depth. The deepest water below
other towers in the world, so far as is
known, does not exceed 12 feet.
Lumber used in the construction will
be furnished largely from the old bleach
ers, and the cost will be a nominal one.
As the amount appropriated is not large,
Brandsten has found rt necessary to call
for volunteer help. All men students in
the University are asked to report at
the lake whenever they have spare time
in the afternoons.
The diving-tower will be completed
in time for the spring swimming sched
ule. Stanford divers will no longer go
to Alameda to practice, and Brandsten
will use the structure extensively in an
effort to turn out more divers of cham
pionship caliber. Clarence Pinkston will
do all of his training at Lagunita when
the tower is finished.
