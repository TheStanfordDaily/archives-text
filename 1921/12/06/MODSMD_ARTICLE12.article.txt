# Professor Anderson Talks On City-State Movement
## 
### 
"Men have in three instances at
tempted to build a government with
out any foundation on which to start,"
said Professor Frederick Anderson of
the Romanic Languages Department in
his address to the Renaissance Club
in the Women's Clubhouse last night.
"The three examples to which I refer
are Iceland, the Italian City-states, and
the French Revolution. I had hoped
the Russian Revolution would be such
an attempt, with a return to the city
state idea, but it has developed into
a despotism with Lenine and Trotsky
on the throne of the Czar."
Professor Anderson characterized
the Renaissance as a tendency, not an
epoch; a tendency that at first af
fected only a small number of people,
and which was aristocratic through
out. "Modern times," he said, "are a
prolongation of the Middle Ages."
