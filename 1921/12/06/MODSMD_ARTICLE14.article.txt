# SPEAKERS TO APPEAL FOR EUROPEAN FUND
## Conditions in Foreign College Centers to be Assembly Topic 
### 
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, of the Food Re
search Institute at Stanford, and Dr.
Anna Cox Brinton of Mills College, will
describe from intimate personal expe
rience the present conditions in Euro
pean universities, at the Assembly which
will be held tomorrow at 10 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall. This Assembly opens
the one-day campaign for the European
Student Fund, which is being carried
on throughout the world by the World's
Student Christian Federation.
President Wilbur will preside, and Dan
Evans, '20, will give the Stanord view
point in its relation to the coming drive
on the campus.
Under what circumstances 12 cents a
day, which is the average budget of the
Central European student, is made to
provide for all expenses, will be ex
plained by Dr. Brinton, who had person
al contact with the university popula
tion during more than a year's work in
the stricken areas. Part of this time
was spent in Germany, with the Society
of Friends, and the latter part in Po
land, under the direction of the Ameri
can Relief Administration.
Dr. Alonzo Taylor will givp an ac
count of the conditions existing through
out Eastern and Central Europe at the
time of his last survey in May of this
year. Dr. Taylor is considered one of
the men in this country who is most
competent to speak on the subject, hav

ing surveyed the area four times to form
a basis for the work of the American
Reuef Administration.
Funds are being raised for the aid of
European students from the students of
every country not left in complete eco
nomic ruin by the ravages of the war.
Included in the contributing nations are
England, France, Italy, China, Japan,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The
distribution area reaches Asia Minor,
the Balkans, France, Germany, Poland,
Latavia, and Turkey.
In order to safeguard against the pos
sible development of pauper students,
all help during the coming year will be
given to upperclassmen. The money col
lected will not be sufficient to send stu
dents through college; it is able only to
help out those who are already earning
their way by employment of every avail
able sort. The relief schemes include
improvement of housing conditions, op
portunities for self help and self sup
port, procuring of books with the help
of other agencies, and the administra
tion of medical relief.
Universities over the entire country
are taking elaborate measures to answer
the call for funds. Johns Hopkins has
placed its campaign in the hands of a
prominent alumnus, and expects to raise
even more than last year. The Univer
sity of Redlands, in Southern California,
numbering only a few hundred students,
has raised approximately $750. Yale
has subscribed $9,000; Oberlin College,
Ohio, pledged itself for $2,800. In Ore
gon, ten colleges and three universities
are engaging in the campaign, and in
Washington there are eight universities
and colleges interested. Stanford raised
$4,000 last year. The amount raised in
various institutions so far average about
$2 a person.
The national committee in charge of
the drive have adopted the following
formula:
Work this out for yourself. Your ex
penses for the year 1921-22. Tuition,
board, room, clothing, travel, social af
fairs and amusements, candy, smokes,
etc. Totalâ€”.
Divide by the number of days in a
school year, $250, and get your expenses
per day. Then give it to a European stu
dent. To you it means only one day. To
the world it means the drawing together
of those student classes in whose hands
lies the fate of the democratic ideals of
Europe, and the strength of internation
alism.
