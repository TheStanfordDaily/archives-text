### 
Delta Kappa Epsilon won a 17 to 13
basketball victory over Chi Psi s quintet,
and Alpha Tau Omega defeated Se
quoia 2 and 4 by a score of 12 to 4, in
the intramural contest last night. Zeta
Psi turned out en masse to play Omega
Chi Alpha but received a forfeit; two
Zeta Psi teams practiced for almost an
hour.
Delta Kappa Epsilon and Chi Psi
played an ordinary first round contest.
The game was not fast, poor dribbling
slowing down the play. Shlaudemann,
running-guard for the winners, cov
ered the court effectively and also tossed
two baskets. George Hays, the running
guard for Chi Psi, carried off consider
able sintillating honors by making half
of his team's scores. Lytle, D. K. E.
forward, made a good combination with
Fuller.
The winning five retained the lead
throughout the game, having a two-point
advantage at the end of the first half,
8 to 6.
The intramural athletics department
of the University of California has sent
a challenge to Stanford for a basketball
series of two out of three games be
tween the intramural championship
teams of each university.
