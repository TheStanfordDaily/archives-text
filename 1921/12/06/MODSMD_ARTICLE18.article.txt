# NEW UNION WILL BE OPERATED BY BOARD AS UNIVERSITY CLUB
## 
### 
A men's University Club, having rules
and regulations regarding qualifications
of members, is the basis on which the
Board of Governors of the new Stan
ford Union, for which nominations for
student members are printed in another
part of this issue, is to run the $250,000
plan to be completed in January. The
Board, for which all officers are chosen
except the student representatives, will
start operations at once, and make plans
and formulate policies for the organiza
tion. A steward or general manager will
be appointed by this body.
The Board of Governors is made up
of three men elected by the alumni, three
faculty members appointed by President
Wilbur, and three A. S. S. U. represen
tatives. The Dean of Men, the Comp
troller, and the President of the Asso
ciated Students will act as ex-oflicio
members.
