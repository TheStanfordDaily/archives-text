# SENIOR WOMEN WIN SECOND TOURNAMENT IN HOCKEY SERIES
## 
### 
Although the senior women won the
second hockey tournament of the final
series yesterday afternoon, they had a
strong defense to fight against in the
freshman team. The freshmen showed
particularly good work in the halves and
fullbacks. Their play was accurate and
swift, guarding well and breaking up
passes. Caroline Strouse, center half,
and Laura Webb, right fullback, are
strong on the '25 team.
Not until the end of the first half were
the upperclass women able to shoot a
goal. Maria Merrill, left wing, caught
a pass and struck the ball into the cage.
The second half was more successful for
the seniors when Josephine Moore scored
within a few minutes after the whistle.
The freshman left wing, Margaret Wat
son, brought the ball down the field
with some fine dribbling, but was inter
cepted within shooting distance of the
goal. Myrtle Klahn, senior center for
ward, scored another point after receiv
ing a fast pass from Carey Bjilard.
Again the freshmen tried a goal but the
'22 women broke up a pass and the
whistle blew with the ball in their hands.
The final score was 3 to 0 in favor of
the seniors.
