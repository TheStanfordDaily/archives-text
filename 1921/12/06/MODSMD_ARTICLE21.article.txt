# Living Up to Agreement.
## 
### 
Word comes from the University of California
that the person who attempted to bomb the Stanford
bonfire from an airplane before the Big Game has
been dealt with by the Student Affairs Committee,
ile is now cognizant of the agreement existing be
tween Stanford and California in regard to the inva
sion of campuses, according to the President of the
Associated Students at Berkeley.
The dispatch with which this matter was handled
by the California student officials indicates that they
are doing everything possible to see that the agree
ment is lived up to. The trouble, as many thought
when the attempt was made to destroy the bonfire,
arose out of ignorance on the part of one student,
a freshman, of the existence of the agreement. It is
not difficult to understand how one person out of
such a large student body could be ignorant of the
principles governing relations between the two uni
versities.
California showed by its careful handling of this
matter that it is doing everything within its power
to see that the full letter of the agreement is lived
up to.
