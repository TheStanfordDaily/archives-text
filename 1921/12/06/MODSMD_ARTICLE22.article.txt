# A 						Helping Hand.
## 
### 
The world is in the throes of a great crisis. Blind
ly, stunihlingly. great peoples are surrounded by a
pall which seems impenetrable, • an intellectual, a
moral, an economic fog which hangs on as if it
would never lift. The cry, the need in the hour of
their distress, is for leaders, leaders who have vi
sion keen enough to bring them out of the dark
canyon of despair.
VVe in America have felt the need; how much more
poignant is that need in Europe, where every insti
tution totters on war-blasted foundations!
From where will the leaders come? The hope of
Europe rests upon the trained men and women of
her universities. And yet the universities of Europe
and their students are face to face with a problem,
which, without the aid of their fellow-students in
America, will mean that learning in Europe will
come to a standstill.
"Why do they need aid?" is the most common
question. The first answer is undoubtedly tliat the
war has deprived over 20,000 European students
from support upon which they depended to keep
them while in the universities. A man who works
sixteen and eighteen hours a day in Europe has a
hard time at present supplying his own need of food
and clothing, to say nothing of the university stu
dent with little time for self-support at his disposal.
Another reason is that thousands of students are
refugees. Students who were studying away from
their own countries have had their communications
with home cut off; many have been on the losing
side of revolution and civil war and have had to
flee from their native countries; others are prison
ers of war who have been permitted to enter uni
versities through the intervention of the Student
Friendship movement; and added to these are stu
dents, who though in their own country, are never
theless refugees. These are found in territories
transferred under the peace treaty from Hungary
to Roumania, Czechoslavia, and Jugoslavia.
One-fifth to one-third of the entire student pop
ulation in Europe is made up of women, dependent
upon meager earnings to stave off starvation and
death, until they can complete their studies.
European students are making a splendid fight to
secure an education. They are up against huge odds.
We should encourage them by every means within
our power.
Our brotherly and sisterly cooperation extended
to our struggling fellow-students across the water
means a great deal to them. Nothing promotes in
ternational friendship and understanding so much as
a helping hand, extended by college men and women
of America through the medium of the World Stu
dent Christian Federation, of which President Wil
bur and Herbert Hoover are advisers.
On Wednesday, an assembly will be held at which

we will learn further what odds our fellow-students
are up against, and how we may help them to se
cure the education which we prize. L. T. D.

The world is in the throes of a great crisis. Blind
ly, stunihlingly. great peoples are surrounded by a
pall which seems impenetrable, • an intellectual, a
moral, an economic fog which hangs on as if it
would never lift. The cry, the need in the hour of
their distress, is for leaders, leaders who have vi
sion keen enough to bring them out of the dark
canyon of despair.
VVe in America have felt the need; how much more
poignant is that need in Europe, where every insti
tution totters on war-blasted foundations!
From where will the leaders come? The hope of
Europe rests upon the trained men and women of
her universities. And yet the universities of Europe
and their students are face to face with a problem,
which, without the aid of their fellow-students in
America, will mean that learning in Europe will
come to a standstill.
"Why do they need aid?" is the most common
question. The first answer is undoubtedly tliat the
war has deprived over 20,000 European students
from support upon which they depended to keep
them while in the universities. A man who works
sixteen and eighteen hours a day in Europe has a
hard time at present supplying his own need of food
and clothing, to say nothing of the university stu
dent with little time for self-support at his disposal.
Another reason is that thousands of students are
refugees. Students who were studying away from
their own countries have had their communications
with home cut off; many have been on the losing
side of revolution and civil war and have had to
flee from their native countries; others are prison
ers of war who have been permitted to enter uni
versities through the intervention of the Student
Friendship movement; and added to these are stu
dents, who though in their own country, are never
theless refugees. These are found in territories
transferred under the peace treaty from Hungary
to Roumania, Czechoslavia, and Jugoslavia.
