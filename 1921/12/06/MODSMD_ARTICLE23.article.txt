How about somebody returning the comb to the three

In common with all Parrots, Purple one has told lot

Wonder if "Shiek" publicity agent had anything to do

Lydia Peruna will soon be picking All-Star Kissing

Applications for game with team will be received by

Said party is conscientious penalizer.

Question is, who taught Purple Parrot to use that

Since it is apparently becoming the form to somehow
be embroiled in Cabbage warfare, Tuesday wishes to put
up his dukes in defense of the insinuation that the

A FABLE
Once upon a time there was a maiden living in Hog
hollow. She attended the Hoghollow Onion Educational
Institute and was the pride and joy of her poor, but
honest, parents.
Even though she had a face that would throw a
switch, she was neatly dressed according to the Searr.-
Roebuck manual, which hung at her right-hand side.
In fact, it would be fair to say that she was fairly fair
and had a kinda kind face.
The townspeople (both of them) looked with pride
upon her as she delivered the valedictory address at the
Hoghollow Onion. (Florist, a bunch of cabbage roses).
Father was so moved that he rented the farm on the
outskirts of Hoghollow and moved across the street into
a modest shack in the city proper. The difference would
send daughter to college so what's the difference!
Being very studious, a brilliant hockey player and
comparatively homely, she had no trouble in getting the
registrar to take her ninety-five dollars. Alas, she did
not hesitate in spending the first year's rent in a snappy
layout to attract the varsity snaking squad, which had
been in training all summer working up effective lines
at the summer beaches. Her bucolic simplicity, her
full blooming cheeks and her bovine eyes melted all
their hearts although they had had their iron every
day.
The President's Reception at the Imperial Palace
offered her an opportunity to interpret the Hoghollow
Ingersoll which had a movement which was a decided
improvement on the obsolete shimmy. From that mo
ment the snakes had her. She received several rings
a day on the telephone and many offers of gold rings
by night but all she took was the opportunity to get
darker rings. Popularity plus, but she made no or
ganizations!
After two quarters and a nineteen seventy-nine debit
on the third, had passed, the weekly rattles puffed into
Hoghollow and the ex-coed lightly tripped off of the
last car, and hence, after dusting herself off, to home
and the family's waiting arms. Although the arms were
waiting they were not aimed straight and she got to
the modest shack in Hoghollow proper in safety.
Several months later she started to live happily ever
after with Jan Peterson the son of the county plumber
and saving the Sunday supplement to spread on the
kitchen floor after scrubbing.
After three years she returned to the old Quad again
with her husband who had registered in the Russian
department to prepare for his life work of developing
his father's business. At least, the moral victory for
the heroine!
Moral: —There is more than one way of becoming a
Stanford Dame. —AESOP KEM.
* * *
We are inclined to favor the suggestion of the fair
co-ed (blonde) who would like to see the Cabbage head
with a higher brow. However, it's anything the cor
respondents say.
» *■ 4
The Linotyper on the end machine says he has noticed
lately that the herring isn't the only poor fish who got
a smoke-up.
♦ * *
Mrs. "Wizard" Schaefer says that she knew the pres
ent champion had the billiards in him. Sounds like the
lead of a Tanlac ad.
* * *
The news columns proclaim that the coming Student
Body Dance will be chaperoned by the members of the
Board of Athletic Control and their wives. Bill wants
to know what arrangements have been made to marry
Patrick, Betts and Evans on time. Call out the Dames!

Friday Night
New moon light
But nothing to do for me.
Get a girl

Still nothing to do for me.

Nothing to do. —Hot Dagger!

A FABLE
Once upon a time there was a maiden living in Hog
hollow. She attended the Hoghollow Onion Educational
Institute and was the pride and joy of her poor, but
honest, parents.
Even though she had a face that would throw a
switch, she was neatly dressed according to the Searr.-
Roebuck manual, which hung at her right-hand side.
In fact, it would be fair to say that she was fairly fair
and had a kinda kind face.
The townspeople (both of them) looked with pride
upon her as she delivered the valedictory address at the
Hoghollow Onion. (Florist, a bunch of cabbage roses).
Father was so moved that he rented the farm on the
outskirts of Hoghollow and moved across the street into
a modest shack in the city proper. The difference would
send daughter to college so what's the difference!
Being very studious, a brilliant hockey player and
comparatively homely, she had no trouble in getting the
registrar to take her ninety-five dollars. Alas, she did
not hesitate in spending the first year's rent in a snappy
layout to attract the varsity snaking squad, which had
been in training all summer working up effective lines
at the summer beaches. Her bucolic simplicity, her
full blooming cheeks and her bovine eyes melted all
their hearts although they had had their iron every
day.
The President's Reception at the Imperial Palace
offered her an opportunity to interpret the Hoghollow
Ingersoll which had a movement which was a decided
improvement on the obsolete shimmy. From that mo
ment the snakes had her. She received several rings
a day on the telephone and many offers of gold rings
by night but all she took was the opportunity to get
darker rings. Popularity plus, but she made no or
ganizations!
After two quarters and a nineteen seventy-nine debit
on the third, had passed, the weekly rattles puffed into
Hoghollow and the ex-coed lightly tripped off of the
last car, and hence, after dusting herself off, to home
and the family's waiting arms. Although the arms were
waiting they were not aimed straight and she got to
the modest shack in Hoghollow proper in safety.
Several months later she started to live happily ever
after with Jan Peterson the son of the county plumber
and saving the Sunday supplement to spread on the
kitchen floor after scrubbing.
After three years she returned to the old Quad again
with her husband who had registered in the Russian
department to prepare for his life work of developing
his father's business. At least, the moral victory for
the heroine!

A FABLE
Once upon a time there was a maiden living in Hog
hollow. She attended the Hoghollow Onion Educational
Institute and was the pride and joy of her poor, but
honest, parents.
Even though she had a face that would throw a
switch, she was neatly dressed according to the Searr.-
Roebuck manual, which hung at her right-hand side.
In fact, it would be fair to say that she was fairly fair
and had a kinda kind face.
The townspeople (both of them) looked with pride
upon her as she delivered the valedictory address at the
Hoghollow Onion. (Florist, a bunch of cabbage roses).
Father was so moved that he rented the farm on the
outskirts of Hoghollow and moved across the street into
a modest shack in the city proper. The difference would
send daughter to college so what's the difference!
Being very studious, a brilliant hockey player and
comparatively homely, she had no trouble in getting the
registrar to take her ninety-five dollars. Alas, she did
not hesitate in spending the first year's rent in a snappy
layout to attract the varsity snaking squad, which had
been in training all summer working up effective lines
at the summer beaches. Her bucolic simplicity, her
full blooming cheeks and her bovine eyes melted all
their hearts although they had had their iron every
day.
The President's Reception at the Imperial Palace
offered her an opportunity to interpret the Hoghollow
Ingersoll which had a movement which was a decided
improvement on the obsolete shimmy. From that mo
ment the snakes had her. She received several rings
a day on the telephone and many offers of gold rings
by night but all she took was the opportunity to get
darker rings. Popularity plus, but she made no or
ganizations!
After two quarters and a nineteen seventy-nine debit
on the third, had passed, the weekly rattles puffed into
Hoghollow and the ex-coed lightly tripped off of the
last car, and hence, after dusting herself off, to home
and the family's waiting arms. Although the arms were
waiting they were not aimed straight and she got to
the modest shack in Hoghollow proper in safety.
Several months later she started to live happily ever
after with Jan Peterson the son of the county plumber
and saving the Sunday supplement to spread on the
kitchen floor after scrubbing.
After three years she returned to the old Quad again
with her husband who had registered in the Russian
department to prepare for his life work of developing
his father's business. At least, the moral victory for
the heroine!

We are inclined to favor the suggestion of the fair
co-ed (blonde) who would like to see the Cabbage head
with a higher brow. However, it's anything the cor
respondents say.

Friday Night
New moon light
But nothing to do for me.
Get a girl
Head a whirl
Still nothing to do for me.
Babbling brook
Find a nook
Nobody there to see.
Trading lies
For tender sighs
Nothing to do. —Hot Dagger!
—Rich and Burns, Not Inc.
