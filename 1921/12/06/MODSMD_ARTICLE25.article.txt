## 
### 
"The class of 1923," said Howard
Brown, president, today, "has the op
portunity to hack one of the best year
books that lias ever been published in
the history of Stanford University. 1
feel that we will do it in typical 1923
fashion."
This statement by the junior president
was made in reference to the drive that
will start today and run until Wednes
day. for the collection of junior class
dues. Prompt payment of dues will
greatly facilitate the work of the Quad
staff, said Brown. "The work being
done by the staff at present constitutes
the most vital effort that can be made
for the success of publication, and the
backing of the class is desired."
