# VARIOUS SIDELIGHTS UPON CAPTAIN E. L. BEACH, U.S.N. "JUST AN EVERYDAY MAN"
## 
### 
"Just a plain, everyday man, who
spejit thirty-seven years in the navy, and
after much thought and prayer decided
to come here to realize a long cherished
desire to deal intimately with naval his
tory."
Captain Edward Latimer Beach, U. S.
! N., retired, lecturer in Naval History at
Stanford, would prefer to be character
ized by that statement alone. Though a
man of distinction and particular attain
ments, he would prefer to have them
overlooked, and to be judged solely in
I the light of an ordinary commonplace
\ man.
To those who enjoy acquaintance with
I him, his quiet dignity, his genial per
; sonality and his democracy make him
I stand out as a man among men. To
| those who can call Captain Beach
I "friend," these qualities are even more
apparent. He is a live, virile man, be
: lieving in the Golden Rule as the pri
j mary rule of life; he is an active Chris
| tian gentleman, practicing the principles
I which he professes.
As a man, we can best take the ver
j diet of the many who have served with
[ him in the navy, and the men who
! worked under his direction at the second
largest U. S. Navy Yard. At Mare Isl
j and, where he served as commandant
from 1919 until a few weeks ago. when
: lie left to come to Stanford, thousands of
i men worked in the shops of which he
j was the head. In two years spent among
; these men, the writer never heard a sin
gle remark concerning Captain Beach
which was not complimentary.
On the other side of the channel from
the navy yard, stands Vallejo, whose
30,000 people are one in their respect
for him. He was the first commandant
since the days of Admiral Farragut to
interest himself in a constructive man
ner in the affairs of this city, in which
an average of 8,000 of his workmen
lived.
Captain Beach was born in Toledo,
Ohio, shortly after the Civil War, his
parents later moving to Minnesota. From
an early age he determined to enter the
navy, and in 1884 his wish was realized
when he was appointed to the Naval
Academy. From Annapolis he entered
the naval service as an assistant engi
neer.
As engineer officer on the U. S. S.
Baltimore, he saw action under Dewey
at Manila Bay. During the Philippine
insurrection, he was captured by Agui
naldo's men, and carried to' the leader

himself, who in lieu of shooting Beach
presented him with ail autographed photo
and turned him loose.
In 1889, Beach was promoted to a
lieutenancy. In 1910, he was promoted
to commander, and in 1914 was given
the rank of captain. When he retired
to take over the chair of Naval History
at Stanford, he was one of the ten rank
ing captains in the navy.
Captain Beach served as engineer of
ficer at the Boston Navy Yard in 1910.
He was in command of the U. S. S.
Vestal at the occupation of Vera Cruz-
Later, he was placed in the command
of the Fortress of Don Juan de Ulloa at
the harbor entrance. He saw further
service as chief of staff to Admiral Ca
perton.
When in 1915 the affairs of Haiti and
Santo Domingo became so involved that
intervention was necessary, Captain
Beach as the commanding officer of the
U. S. S. Washington, took an active
part in the pacification. Later, he took
command of the ill-fated Memphis,
which was engulfed without warning by
a Carribean typhoon in 1916. In 1917,
he was sent as commandant to the New
port Torpedo Station, after which he
was transferred for active service in the
North Sea.
Here the drcadnaught New York was
under his command. When the van
quished German fleet crept down the
lane formed by the triumphant allied
ship, at Scapa Floa, Captain Beach wit
nessed the spectacle, the most momen
tous in naval history.
Captain Beach has the right to wear
several medals, given in recognition of
his service. "Who's Who" has seen fit
to list him among great American men
of affairs.
But aside from his service as an offi
cer in charge of important ships, and as
an executive directing the activities of
great naval establishments, Captain
Beach has successfully demonstrated his
versatility.
One proof of this is found in his writ
ing, a hobby with him. Many of us have
read, no doubt, of the trials of "Roger
Paulding' and "Ralph Osborn" at An
napolis and in the active navy life, as
Captain Beach has depicted them in his
excellent series of juvenile works. As
a naval expert, he has contributed papers
to 'American periodicals. He now in
tends to satisfy the great ambition of
writing a naval history, there being few
written treatises on this phase of our
national life. His lectures will form the
basis of the hook.
Shortly after Captain Beach left Mare
Island to present the course in Naval
History at Stanford, Captain Knox, a
close Mare Island associate, was called
to Harvard to present a like course
there. Stanford thus stole a march on
the oldest college in America, being the
first in the United States to establish a
chair of Naval History. In filling that
chair, Stanford has undoubtedly picked
the best man in America, who through
deep study and personal observation has
a fund of knowledge on naval history
that is unsurpassed.
His broadness of mind, his high prin
ciples. and his personality commend him
to Stanford men and women, who are
here, taught to develop those qualities
which are evident in Captain Beach.
Stanford will find in him a ready friend,
a learned instructor, and a real man.
