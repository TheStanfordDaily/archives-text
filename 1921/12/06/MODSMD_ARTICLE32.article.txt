# PROFESSOR TREAT'S LATEST BOOK IS ON JAPANESE AND U. S.
## 
### 
A new book by Professor P. J. Treat
on "Japan and the United States," has
just been received from tht. publisher.-
by the Hoover War Collection at the
library. Ihe work consists for the most
part of a series of twelve lectures on the
relations of Japan and the United States
from 1853 up to the present time., which
Professor 1 reat has been delivering at
four of the leading Japanese universities
this fall.
Professor Treat has paid special at
tention throughout the lectures to mat
ters' which have had an influence upon
the formation of public opinion in Japan,
and has made an attempt to account for
prevailing views of the Japanese and
American peoples toward each other at
different times in the period considered.
The present friendly attitude of Ameri
cans toward the Japanese is revealed,
and at the same time reasons for the
lessening of enthusiasm for them in the
United States are given.
The special topics which Professor
Treat has taken up in the lectures suc
cessfully are: "Peace and Friendship,"
"Commercial Intercourse," "The Treaties
in Jeopardy," "The Restoration of the
Emperor, "The Rise of New Japan,"
"The Revision of the Treaties," "Japan
and Her Neighbors," "The Open Door
in China," "After the Russo-Japanese
War," "Japan, America and the World
War," "The New Far East," and "The
Japanese in America."
Some of the statements made by Pro
fessor Treat in the last lecture are of
special significance in relation to the
Japanese question in California. In it he
has said, "The so-called Japanese prob
lem in America is simply one phase of
an age-long and world-wide problem, the
adjustment of human relations," and he
has gone on to explain that "The last
adjustment which the. human family is
called upon to make is that between the
races of different color, for the rank
and file of mankind still classify men by
color rather than by mental or moral
attainments."
"The Japanese question in California
and in other western states, consists of
two elements, which should not be con
fused," according to Professor Treat.
These he has stated to be. the question
of immigration and the treatment of
Japanese who are lawfully residents in
the United States. "In considering this
problem of immigration we must be
guided by practical rather than theoreti
cal considerations," said he, and stated
that there should be little occasion for
resentment on the part of the. Japanese
for the treatment of their nationals in
the American states in the future. "As
the years pass by, and Americans un
derstand the Japanese residents better,"
said Professor Treat, "it is reasonable
to believe that the desire for political or
economic restrictions will cease." He
has concluded his work in the following
optimistic statements: "Time is the
great solvent of present problems. And
contact between the races presents no
insoluble difficulties, none which time
and a mutual desire to be reasonable
and fair cannot remove "
