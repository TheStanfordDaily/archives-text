# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
THE IRISH SITUATION—
The most encouraging item of to
! day's news is in connection with the
j Irish situation. After tedious con
i ference of the Government officials
and Sinn Fein Representatives at least
a tentative agreement has been reach
ed. The terms have not yet been pub
lished but the agreement will be sub
mitted to Parliament and the Dail
Eireann. A copy has been sent to Sir
James Craig, the Ulster Premier, and
he was to confer today with Lloyd
George.
THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
Reports seem to indicate that Lloyd
George will not attend the Arms Par
ley, due to the critical developments
of the Irish negotiations.
The idea if a Four-Power Entente
has developed to the point where the
tentative draft of a treaty is being
considered by some of the delegates.
There has been no definite action,
however, committing the American
government to the Entente plan. Mak
ing the reduction of naval armaments
dependent, on political rearrangements
in contrary to the American view
point and would be resisted by the
United States, wheres there is some
feeling among the British and Japan
ese delegates that the issues are so
closely allied that separate settle
ments would be impossible.
The work of the Conference is at
present mainly in the hands of sub
committees. Japan has made further
concessions in the committees deal
ing with Chinese demands. On the
other hand Philip K. C. Tyan, the
secretary general of the Chinese dele
gation, has resigned because of his
personal conviction that there is to be
no satisfactory solution of the ques
tion raised by China.
CONGRESS AGAIN IN SESSION
Congress reassembled yesterday.
President Harding's first annual mes
sage to Congress was to be delivered
today. The incident of most interest
in yesterday's session was the pre
sentation in a message by President
Harding, of the Federal Appropriation
Estimates prepared under the New
Budget Law. The interest on the pub
lic debt is the largest single item,
amounting to $975,000,000, which is
only $25,000,000 less than the total
annual expenditure of the Federal gov
ernment before the war. The total ex
penditures for the fiscal year 1923 is
estimated at $3,505,745,727.
THE PACKERS' STRIKE
The M£at Packers' Strike in the
centers of that industry throughout
the Middle-West began yesterday.
The union officials who appeared be
fore the Kansas Court of Industrial
Relations maintain that the strike is
the result of dissatisfaction with the
recent cut in wages, decreed by the
Plant Assemblies on which, they claim,
the employers are not justly repre
sented.
There was some violence during the
first day of the strike in St. Paul, and
in Kanasas City, where the mayor
threatened to ask Governor Allen to
send in the State Militia unless the
crowds before the factories were dis
persed.

THE IRISH SITUATION—
The most encouraging item of to
! day's news is in connection with the
j Irish situation. After tedious con
i ference of the Government officials
and Sinn Fein Representatives at least
a tentative agreement has been reach
ed. The terms have not yet been pub
lished but the agreement will be sub
mitted to Parliament and the Dail
Eireann. A copy has been sent to Sir
James Craig, the Ulster Premier, and
he was to confer today with Lloyd
George.
THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
Reports seem to indicate that Lloyd
George will not attend the Arms Par
ley, due to the critical developments
of the Irish negotiations.
The idea if a Four-Power Entente
has developed to the point where the
tentative draft of a treaty is being
considered by some of the delegates.
There has been no definite action,
however, committing the American
government to the Entente plan. Mak
ing the reduction of naval armaments
dependent, on political rearrangements
in contrary to the American view
point and would be resisted by the
United States, wheres there is some
feeling among the British and Japan
ese delegates that the issues are so
closely allied that separate settle
ments would be impossible.
The work of the Conference is at
present mainly in the hands of sub
committees. Japan has made further
concessions in the committees deal
ing with Chinese demands. On the
other hand Philip K. C. Tyan, the
secretary general of the Chinese dele
gation, has resigned because of his
personal conviction that there is to be
no satisfactory solution of the ques
tion raised by China.
CONGRESS AGAIN IN SESSION
Congress reassembled yesterday.
President Harding's first annual mes
sage to Congress was to be delivered
today. The incident of most interest
in yesterday's session was the pre
sentation in a message by President
Harding, of the Federal Appropriation
Estimates prepared under the New
Budget Law. The interest on the pub
lic debt is the largest single item,
amounting to $975,000,000, which is
only $25,000,000 less than the total
annual expenditure of the Federal gov
ernment before the war. The total ex
penditures for the fiscal year 1923 is
estimated at $3,505,745,727.
THE PACKERS' STRIKE
The M£at Packers' Strike in the
centers of that industry throughout
the Middle-West began yesterday.
The union officials who appeared be
fore the Kansas Court of Industrial
Relations maintain that the strike is
the result of dissatisfaction with the
recent cut in wages, decreed by the
Plant Assemblies on which, they claim,
the employers are not justly repre
sented.
There was some violence during the
first day of the strike in St. Paul, and
in Kanasas City, where the mayor
threatened to ask Governor Allen to
send in the State Militia unless the
