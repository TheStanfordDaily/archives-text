can Journalists' Association tomorrow

"There are many people who are pre
paring for journalism as a life work,"
Professor Smith said, "who do not know
whether it would be better to first work
on a small city daily or to go directly
into metropolitan reporting. Others
consider a small city as the best field
for activity. Dallas Wood has had ex
perience in reporting for both large and
small papers, and will doubtless be able
to throw a great deal of light on the
subject."

for the Panama-Pacific International
Exposition in 1916, and has had other
experience reporting for large papers.
Since then he has worked for smaller
