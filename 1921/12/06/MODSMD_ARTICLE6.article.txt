The World Publishing Company, of
Yonkers, New York, announces that
Professor Melville Best Anderson's
translation of the Divina Commedia is
now ready for distribution. Selections
from this translation were read at the
Dante sexcentennial celebration held at
Stanford this fall, by Professor Bassett
of the English Department. Dr. Ander
son was formerly professor of English
at Stanford, retiring from active teach
ing several years ago. He has spent
about eighteen years on the work of this
translation, and has made several trips
to Italy in the interest of this work.
Professor Anderson has been in New
York since early summer, supervising
the publication of his translation, and ex
pects to return some time after Christ
mas.
A special edition which comprises 390
copies, numbered and autographed, will
be issued first. This edition will be
printed on hand-made paper with full
deckle -edges. Drawings of coats-of
arms referred to in the poem will com
pose the illustrations; the whole will be
beautifully bound in Italian boards, with
vellum back and gilt top, and stamped
in gold leaf on the backbone. Dr. An
derson last retained all of Dante's simple
directness by avoiding the addition of
epithets to preserve the rime and the
meter and which consequently weaken
the impressiveness of the original. The
translation is in tcrsa rima, or triple rime
which is the meter of the original.
