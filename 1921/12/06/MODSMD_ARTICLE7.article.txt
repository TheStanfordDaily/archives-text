# FAST CONTESTS FEATURE CLASS FISTIC MATCHES
## Coach Maloney Looks Forwards to successful Season Next Quarter in Bouts 
### 
Five fast bouts featured the first
round of the interclass tournament held
in the gymnasium yesterday afternoon.
Coach Harry Maloney is highly pleased
with the showing made by the men, and
is very optimistic over the chances of
the Cardinal pugilists for the coming
season. The intercollegiate tournaments
will start in the early part of the winter
quarter, and it is expected that by the
time of the tournament with the Uni
versity of California, the latter part of
March, there will be a strong team rep
resenting Stanford in the roped arena.
There were two bouts in the light
weight division yesterday afternoon.
Jack Fishburn and Earl Collins gave the
prettiest exhibition of boxing seen in the
local ring for some time. These men
boxed the regulation three two-minute
rounds, and were called upon to go an
extra round in order to decide the win
ner. The bout was finally called a draw
and the decision was well received. Both
of these men are willing mixers and
with a little more experience should de
velop into first-class lighters. Perritt
and Penwell, also lightweights, boxed
a rather slow match which was won by
Penwell because of his better condition.
In the featherweight class, two rather
one-sided matches were held. K. Sa
pero won from D. Rowland without
much difficulty owing to his aggressive
tactics. K. Shipp easily won over E. T.
Smith. Shipp is fast and aggressive,
and follows up his advantages. He
looks like good varsity material.
The feature bout of the day was in the
welterweight division. William Neill
and Stuart Van Hook, freshmen foot
ball stars, donned the gloves and an ex
cellent exhibition of give and take box
ing resulted. Little science and a great
deal of wild swinging resulted in a slam
bang bout which was highly satisfactory
from the spectators' standpoint.
Howard Brown, '23, refereed the
matches.

first round is as follows: Tuesday, 4
