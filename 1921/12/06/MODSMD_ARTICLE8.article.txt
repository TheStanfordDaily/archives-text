New swimming stars, whom Coach
Brandsten is inclined to think will rank
among the top-notchers of the Coast
with a little more experience, have been
uncovered in fall practice.
Hi Wooster, '22, is the one who start
led Brandsten the most. He has been
devoting most of his time to water polo
until last week he took a fling at the
220-yard free style. His time was noth
ing short of sensational considering the
few times he had swam the race. Woos
ter possesses a strong stroke, and he is
counted on to score many points for the
Cardinal in the coming meets.
Fred Fisher, '24, Don Greenwood, '24,
and R. M. Hirschman, '25, have prog
ressed rapidly under Brandsten's tute
lage in the back stroke. This event is
the weakest spot in Stanford's well-bal
anced aggregation. Fletcher has been
entering it and doing well, but Brand
sten wants to concentrate him hereafter
upon the breast stroke.
