# MUSICIANS GIVE PERFORMANCE OF TECHNICAL SKILL
## Violinist and Pianist Please In Variety of Numbers In First Peninsular Concert 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
By Mary Jane Clark, '22

The joint recital given by Alfred Mi
rovitch, pianist, and Mishel Piastro, vio
linist, last evening, was a brilliant dis
play of musicianship and of technical
mastery. Both artists established them
selves immediately by their assured
methods of execution, and the many en
cores demanded were an evidence of
the quality of their exhibition. The pro
gram, ranging from Chopin to original
numbers by the two artists, was one most
fortunately adapted to reveal their tech
nical accomplishments.
Mirovitch, together with faultless exe
cution, possesses the gift of deep in
sight into the beauty of his music. Even
under the most exacting demands of
technique, in the most intricate passages
of crashing chords or in the softest
pianissimo effects, lie keeps the sig
nificance of his music apparent. He plays
with breadth of tone, his phrasing is pre
cisely accented and he has every re
source at his finger tips.
Such a rendition as that of the Chopin
Sonata, and particularly the original in
terpretation of the "Marche Funebre"
movement of this number is one not to
be forgotten. Mirovitch fulfilled all the
exactitudes of the Chopin "Fantasia,"
"Nocturne," "Mazurka," and "Valse" of
the first group with perfect ingenuity.
The "Valse," a rapid, lyrical composi
tion, was a particularly acute test of
technical powers.
Mirovitch's closing group contained
a "Minuet," composed by himself, a
most appealing and delightful number,
as well as Schubert-Lizst's "Hark, Hark,
the Lark," and a beautiful Lizst Rapso
dy, admirably executed.
Really remarkable dexterity and con
trol characterized the playing of Mishel
Piastro. He is capable of technical ac
complishments that are nothing short of
dazzling and which give to his work an
unusually distinct style. He is ingen
ious. The mechanical aspect of his play
ing is truly unique in this respect.
Lola's "Symphony Espagnole" afford
ed opportunity for the display of many
phases of the violinist's artistry. The
"Allegro" was delightfully pleasing for
its intricacies of sound and in the "Ron
do" Piastro exhibited most interesting
flexibility.
His second group included an "Ave
Maria," a "Hungarian Dance," his own
arrangement of the "Lonely Wanderer,"
and a most engrossing piece, the "Rus
sian Carneval," the interpretation of
which was a revelation of the power and
control of the artist. The "Ave Maria"
was notable for great clearness and
beauty of tone, preserved in the highest
notes.
