# STUDENT ASSEMBLY HELD FOR AID FUND
## PROMINENT SPEAKERS PRESENT CONDITIONS IN FAMISHED EUROPEAN DISTRICTS 
### 
"In contributing to the European Stu
dent Fund, we are availing ourselves of
an opportunity to give where it is des
perately needed, and to bind closer to
us the fellow students who will be the
democratic leaders of the future." With
these words, Dan Evans, '20, president
of the studenty body, giving the pith
of Stanford's attitude in relation to the
problems of relief in Europe, summar
ized the assembly which was held at 10
o'clock this morning in the Assembly
Hall.
"Students of America," he continued,
have but lately left their policy of pro
vincialism for a definite stand in world
affairs. We have sent resolutions to the
armament conference favoring peace
measures. Here is a movement which
will testify to our concrete efforts to
ward a true international fellowship.
Dr. Wilbur, who presided at the as
sembly, in his opening speech, struck the

same note of the inherent brotherhood of
college students the world over.
An account of conditions based on a
year's experience in Poland under the
A. R. A. was the subject of the first
address by Dr. Anna Cox Brinton of
Mills College. The startling lack of
food was to Dr. Brinton the most poig
nant phase of the situation.
"A large majority of students are ex
isting every day on what is equivalent
to our breakfast," she stated. "Scholar
ships and stipends offered to students
have taken the form of a guarantee of
one or perhaps two meals a week. Lab
oratories are filled every noon with stu
dents who are trying to forget their hun
ger in work."
Speaking of possibilities for employ
ment, she said that they were denied to
most students, due to lack of available
work. Those who are earning money,
do so in mines, or as policemen on night
duty, and at other unskilled labor."
In conclusion, Dr. Brinton said: "The
crowded living conditions, the lack of
soap, hot water, nourishment, and rest
have produced conditions which are to
us unthinkable. Students feed them
selves on thoughts of our comfort. Our
luxury is their amazement. Let our gen
erosity be their astonishment."
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, who has four times
surveyed the relief area under the A. R.
A., gave his analysis of the political sit
uation in its bearing on university prob
lems.
"Conditions in European student
bodies," lie said, "are not their fault,
but the results of the war. Before the
war they were directed and provided for
by the ruling class, and the students
were drawn from this same class. Now
it is the old middle-class on whom must
rest responsibility for them. And it is
this class which has been most injured
by the war. Original revenues no longer
exist, and governments are threatened
with the need to abolish universities al
together.
"Aid must be given in three directions:
to the faculty, to the students, and to the
institutions themselves. The Common
wealth Clubs and Allied donations have
for one year kept the professors from
starvation. Governments will maintain
the universities as far as possible. It re
mains for outsiders to undertake the
more difficult task of helping the stu
dents. And this is a work which is fully
as vital as the relief of little children,
and will do as much for the peace of
the. world as armament conferences. In
five years the contributions made by the
United States will be a vital factor in
establishing, through intelligent leader
ship, the relations of the countries of
the world."

Dr. Wilbur, who presided at the as
sembly, in his opening speech, struck the

same note of the inherent brotherhood of
college students the world over.
An account of conditions based on a
year's experience in Poland under the
A. R. A. was the subject of the first
address by Dr. Anna Cox Brinton of
Mills College. The startling lack of
food was to Dr. Brinton the most poig
nant phase of the situation.
"A large majority of students are ex
isting every day on what is equivalent
to our breakfast," she stated. "Scholar
ships and stipends offered to students
have taken the form of a guarantee of
one or perhaps two meals a week. Lab
oratories are filled every noon with stu
dents who are trying to forget their hun
ger in work."
Speaking of possibilities for employ
ment, she said that they were denied to
most students, due to lack of available
work. Those who are earning money,
do so in mines, or as policemen on night
duty, and at other unskilled labor."
In conclusion, Dr. Brinton said: "The
crowded living conditions, the lack of
soap, hot water, nourishment, and rest
have produced conditions which are to
us unthinkable. Students feed them
selves on thoughts of our comfort. Our
luxury is their amazement. Let our gen
erosity be their astonishment."
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, who has four times
surveyed the relief area under the A. R.
A., gave his analysis of the political sit
uation in its bearing on university prob
lems.
"Conditions in European student
bodies," lie said, "are not their fault,
but the results of the war. Before the
war they were directed and provided for
by the ruling class, and the students
were drawn from this same class. Now
it is the old middle-class on whom must
rest responsibility for them. And it is
this class which has been most injured
by the war. Original revenues no longer
exist, and governments are threatened
with the need to abolish universities al
together.
"Aid must be given in three directions:
to the faculty, to the students, and to the
institutions themselves. The Common
wealth Clubs and Allied donations have
for one year kept the professors from
starvation. Governments will maintain
the universities as far as possible. It re
mains for outsiders to undertake the
more difficult task of helping the stu
dents. And this is a work which is fully
as vital as the relief of little children,
and will do as much for the peace of
the. world as armament conferences. In
five years the contributions made by the
United States will be a vital factor in
establishing, through intelligent leader
ship, the relations of the countries of
the world."
"In contributing to the European Stu
dent Fund, we are availing ourselves of
an opportunity to give where it is des
perately needed, and to bind closer to
us the fellow students who will be the
democratic leaders of the future." With
these words, Dan Evans, '20, president
of the studenty body, giving the pith
of Stanford's attitude in relation to the
problems of relief in Europe, summar
ized the assembly which was held at 10
o'clock this morning in the Assembly
Hall.
"Students of America," he continued,
have but lately left their policy of pro
vincialism for a definite stand in world
affairs. We have sent resolutions to the
armament conference favoring peace
measures. Here is a movement which
will testify to our concrete efforts to
ward a true international fellowship.
