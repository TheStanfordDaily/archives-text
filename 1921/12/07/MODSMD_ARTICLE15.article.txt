# CLASS RING BATTLES REACH SECOND ROUND
## 
### 
Interclass boxing advanced one step
nearer the semi-finals yesterday after
noon, when three bouts were held in
the gymnasium. The matches were
slower and less interesting than those
of Monday, lack of condition and ex
perience showing plainly on nearly
all the contestants.
A. Charles and N. McKee gave the
best exhibition of the afternoon. These
men are both hard hitters and a rapid
exchange of blows at close quarters
resulted in a fast bout. Charles car
ried the fight to his opponent during
most of the battle and he scored a
knockdown in the second round. Mc-
Kee made a whirlwind start in the
last round but he was too late and
CharleV superior condition gave him
a well-earned decision.
B. Adams won a featureless match
from O. J Grover. Repeated,clinches,
slow footwork, and lack of experience
combined to make this match a rather
slow one.
Miller and Graham fought a rather
slow match. Both men clinched re
peatedly and wasted many wild blows.
Lack of condition was miin'y icspons
ible for the slowness of this bout,
which finally ended in a clinch. Gra-
Inm was given the decision.

be completed when the following
matches are held: Robertson-- vs.
