# FOOTBALL MEN MAY GET MILITARY CREDIT
## 
### 
That the Military Department will co
operate to the fullest extent in making
it possible for R. O. T. C. members to
participate in university athletics was
made clear today in a statement by Ma
jor Collins, head of the Military De
partment.
"Many men." he said, "have, hesitated
joining the R. O. T. C. because they
think that it will interfere with their
participation in football, it being impos
sible for them to put in time on both
our practical military instruction, for
which physical training credit is given,
and football as well. We stand ready,
however, to accept time put in at foot
ball in place of our practical work. The
omission of the practical work will make
it harder for the student, but much of
it may be reviewed in later parts of the
course and learned in that manner.
"The R. O. T. C. needs men who arc
active in athletics, who arc leaders, and
the unit here at Stanford will do every
thing it can to aid them in sport."
