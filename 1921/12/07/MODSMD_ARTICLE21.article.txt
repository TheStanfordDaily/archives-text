The modern trend of college dances seems to be

essential parts of a successful dance, it is wise

< past few public dances given by class and other
anizations is to let the provision of the various
sntial accessories out on contract. There is in
first place no necessity for doing so. Every class
every organization that undertakes to give a
ce contains enough members with talent to attend
hese things. Enough people with artistic ability
d will do the decorating for the bare cost of their
e and the materials used can be found to do the
•k. Their profit will come from the compliments
t always accompany a successfully planned affair,
in the personal satisfaction of a job well done,
s same is true of the lighting, the programs, and
refreshments-. Why, then, do organizations sub
these details to contractors whose sole idea is to
ke as much money as possible? We are leaving
question of whether elaborateness is a thing to
desired or not to those with opinions on the sub
t. The fact remains that those who attend cam
x s dances are willing to pay for elaborateness if it
is well done. Organizations which charge an un
usually large amount for their dances and then let
the work out on contract are not standing behind the
promise made with each ticket sold if the accessories
which go to make the dance a success are poorly
executed.
The practice of awarding contracts for practically
everything connected with these campus functions
is a recent one, and therefore it will not be hard to
discontinue. No organization on the campus has
practiced it long enough to make it difficult for them
to go back to the old practice of co-operation and the
use of talent within its own ranks.
