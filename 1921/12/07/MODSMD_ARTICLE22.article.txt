# Now Is the Time.

Through the columns of student publications and
in assemblies we are reminded constantly of existing
traditions that are almost purely local. Sometimes
we are urged to observe these customs and prac
tices that are backed by years of observance. There
are two traditions that are not local and the observ
ance of which is never urged, yet they are undoubt
edly the oldest and most carefully observed traditions
of all universities.
The first is the tradition of cramming. Two or
three times every year, according to whether the

quarter or semester system is the one used, the stu
dent inadvertently turns to burning the midnight
sperm. Just as punctually, the editor of the college
publication turns to and exhorts his fellows that it
is now time to start the practice, and that only a few
days remain. Merchants urge the buying world to
do their Christmas shopping early, and the editor
urges students to do their periodical cramming early.
And so, we exhort you to utilize the midnight
hours from now on to the finish of the quarter, for
these are days and nights that count. The fall quar
ter is probably the hardest for the student. The
whirl of activities contingent with beginning the
new college year keep him from his. studies for the
greater part of the period. The last two or three
weeks then are the hardest. But several days remain
for the little busy bee to improve each shining hour,
and those that are dark can be made to shine, thanks
to Franklin, Edison, et al.
