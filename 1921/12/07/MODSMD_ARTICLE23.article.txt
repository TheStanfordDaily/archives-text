Realizing the competitive power of Cabbages, one
of our contemporaries has sought to undermine our
prestige as the abhorrer of snakes and the champion
of roughs, by sending in the following contribution. The
significance of the deed speaks for itself. The author
never will.

The Terrible Triad
I have a permanently stiff knee, my front teeth are
gone, I have a tin ear and every one of my ribs has been
broken. My heart leaks in every valve, my right arm
is almost useless and I have pulled the ligaments of
my left leg beyond repair. I never enjoy a good smoke
and eat only the coarsest of food. . . I am an athlete.
m * *
I am always in terribly bad health.
My shoulders are narrow and round.
my arms and legs are puny and
have little strength. My eyes are
practically gone but with the aid of
the heaviest lenses available I
manage to distinguish between light
and shade. My appearance is,
moreover, unkept and ragged. . . .
my pride has flown as my college
days have progressed. My lungs are
In bad shape, I sleep poorly and I
seldom can eat more often than
once a day. . . I am a Student.

I am happy and carefree. Life is a garden of joy,
always, and never do I let a dull moment enter my
days. I am good-looking and possess unusual person
ality. I dress well and am seen a good deal around
the campus. I drink and smoke freely and enjoy both.
I laugh at trouble and devote most of my time to youth
ful love and the study of the opposite sex. They, in
turn, are interested in me. I have health and position
... I am always in demand. . . I am the Campus Snake.

The above description appear to refer to a dual per
sonality. The article in itself has one. . . hit and run.

The contributor of the above is perhaps responsible
for the anonymous offering we received the other day
which read as follows: I am cold so cold. I
shiver shake shim—. Ahhhh, the icy chill
I am a frost What shall I dew? ... I am
freezing. I am below freezing I am Zero
I am a co-ed."

Sophomore cotillion breaks out with barber-pole effect.
Impressionistic of three-ball store after Fourth of July.
Decorations sympathetic with most of soup and fish.

Sartorial scheme was unexcelled. Let's make it a tra
dition. Something for coming generations to look back
at. We recommend moustache comb motif for Junior
Prom. Have bright green shrubbery, suggestive of
pea soup.

Senior Ball should be done in bandoline? stream lines,
with glazed paper; mouthed seals'-heads decorating wall.
Programs to be hand painted in carmine (kind that
won't rub off) showing fantasy of Djer Kiss dryads in
play, (or other suitable costume).

Question before the house: —Does a centipede keep
step with himself.

Loud and prolonged cheers. More contribs.

Another Fable
A gang of sophs were feeling right (20 hours) one
Wednesday after the show. When they saw a stude.
with a dink on, sporting a swell dame on the Avenoo
—a week night, too—they compared notes and agreed
that life was joyous. The Terror of '25 was picked to
do the rough stuff. He approached the wayward frosh,
and with all his five feet three inches of sophomoric
dignity, growled: "What's the idea of this queening
on week nights?"
* * »
The frosh looked sick. Then: "Er—rr—meet my
wife." —LITTLE JOE.

We darn near forgot the moral. Here it is: Moral —
a quick reply is better than a swift foot.

Hugo, the midnight moth, was highly impressed by
the light when he remarked that parts of the gym floor
had a rough time Friday night.
