As members of the Stanford Varsity
Debating team we feel that the work of
one of the reporters of this paper de
serves censure. After we had all done
our best and given the greatest portion
of our time to the rece.nt Stanford-Cali
fornia debate, after every member of the
team had done his utmost to uphold the
honor of his Alma Mater and had ne
glected everything else in order to win
an intellectual victory for Stanford, we
were surprised and chagrined at the at
titude displayed by the reporter who was
assigned to our debate. Not only did
his absence at the debate prove his utter
incompetency and careless indifference,
but his account of the event was per
forated with inaccuracies and unjust
criticisms. The things lie wrote, he
would not have written if he had taken
the trouble to come and hear the de
bate. While the critic of the contest
was dancing merrily away at the sopho
more cotillion, the members of the team
were doing their best for Stanford, and
it seems to us quite unjust that any one
of them should be compelled to accept,
without a note of protest, the criticisms
and condemnations that this wily re
porter concocted after he returned from
his pleasure. This method of reporting
through liberal use. of the imagina
tion is'quite new to us; and this idea of
passing cutting criticisms on speeches
that the critic has never even heard is
quite annoying and quite discouraging.
We hope it will never occur again.
