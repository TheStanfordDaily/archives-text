# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF

### 
Iceland Peacc Treaty Signed
A formal peace treaty between Eng
land and Ireland has at last been signed.
The Emerald Isle now has the same
status as the other British dominions,
having a constitutional place in the em
pire with a constitution planned along
the lines of that of Canada. The rep
resentative of the English crown shall
be selected in the same way as the vi
ceroy in Canada.
"The Irish Free State' is the official
name of the. new dominion thus created,
and it will have the right to. an army
and coastal defense of its own, with fi
nancial independence. The treaty must
be ratified by parliament and Ulster, but
not much difficulty is anticipated through
the latter, and none at all through the
former.
Harding Causes Comment
President Harding, in a message to
Congress, has stirred up all kinds of
conflicting feeling through means of a
program of legislation which he sub
mitted, designed to remedy some of the
existing evils throughout the country.
He proposed a labor court to prevent
strikes, urged that the farmers get to
gether in their marketing, and use or
ganization, and said that 20,(X)0,(XX) acres
of areable land, along with 79,()00,(XX)
acres of swamp land, should be re
claimed for ex-service men and others.
Strikes Become Serious
The National Guard has been called
out in Chicago and St. Paul to curb the
violence that is already showing its head
in the big meat packers' strike that
started a few days ago.
The union officials claim that 6,000
more men joined the strike yesterday,
while the packers declare that between
90 and 95 per cent of their force are
still at work. They say that there is no
difficulty in hiring men to take the strik
ers' places.
Japan's Decision Due
Japan's final decision on the Hughes
disarmament plan is due today, and in
the meantime the question of the An
glo-Japanese alliance is causing consid
erable brain-trouble among the dele
gates assembled at Washington An ac
ceptable substitute for that treaty seems
to' be hard to find, but the general con
census of opinion seems to be that such j
a detail will not be allowed to hold up j
the work of disarmament.
Some of the minor Chinese officials j
"resigned" from the conference as a
means of expressing their disapproval i
of the attitude of the conference in re
gard to Japan, but such an action does
not mean much, being more of a "ges
ture" to attract attention than anything
else. C. S. S., '24.
