UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eu
gene, Dec. 7 (P. I. N. S.) â€”A week's
rest is being enjoyed by the Oregon
football squad before practice will be
resumed for the games to be played in
Honolulu during the Christmas vacation.
The team sails from San Francisco De
cember 13 for the island.
The first game will be with the Uni
versity of Hawaii on December 26, and
the second will be with an all-star isl
and team on January 2. Little is known
about the strength of either team ex
cept that the university team is com
posed of veterans from last year and
that they won their first game. A six
game conference is in existence in the
islands, the other teams being made up
of various athletic clubs, the army and
navy teams and similar elevens.
Eighteen men will make the trip to
Honolulu, which is the best ever offered
an Oregon football team from the geo
graphical standpoint. Possible effects
of seasickness on the condition of the
players is a question to be settled by
the voyage,
