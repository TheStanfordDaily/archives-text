# SOPH JUNIOR TEAMS TIE IN THIRD GAME OF WOMEN'S HOCKEY
## 
### 
In the hardest-fought game yet staged
in the final women's hockey tournaments,
the sophomore and junior teams played
a 2-all tie yesterday afternoon on the
Roble field. Jt looked as if the '24 team
had the game until the la-t minute and I
a half, when the juniors made a spectac
ular drive down the field ending in a
goal by Joyce Robson. The whole game
was featured by attempts at goals, first
at one end of the field and then at the
other, the teams being too evenly
matched to permit continued play at
either junior or sophomore goals.
The sophomores were put 011 the de
fense at the beginning of the game when
the junior forwards made a fast pass
down field. Ruth Jameson shot the ball
out of danger, stopping a junior score.
The teams see-sawed up and down the
field in fast, hard play until the juniors
finally succeeded in scoring by a shot
from Dorothy Ward. Ruth Jameson
made a goal for the sophomores at the
end of the half.
Grace Strobel, '24, made some swift
passes and ended in shooting the ball
j into the netting at the beginning of the
I second half. The teams showed line
teamwork throughout.
The second teams of the senior and
freshmen classes played a 2 to 2 tie also
in a fast, close game.
