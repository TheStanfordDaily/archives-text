"The Way Men Dress" is the title of
the first charge of the co-educational de
baters at the Wranglers -Euphronia joint
session. Five evils, insufferable and un
excusable, will be charged against the of

"The Law Steps," where the air rises

vitriolic tirade from one who has to
walk around, or jump. "The Engineer
ing Corner," abode of the wily rough,
who peers from behind his bush and
catches maidens unawares, is to be ex
posed. "Assembly Hall Traditions" will
be squashed flat and tossed to be breeze,
when the gallery comes down on the oc
cupants of the lower floor.
"The Attitude of Men Towards
Women," summing up in all its "iniquity
the entire shameful list of shortcomings,
will be the subject of the final sensa
tional charge.
