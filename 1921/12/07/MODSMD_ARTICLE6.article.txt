# TEAM WORK MARKS CONTEST OF S. A. E.- EL CAPITAN FIVES
## 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi, Sigma Alpha Ep
silon, and Encina Fourth Floor, were
victors in the intramural basketball
contests held last night and this morn
ing.
The Sigma Alpha Epsilon and El
Capitan quaintets put on one of the
hardest fought first-round intramural
games. One basket was the margin
by which the winners led when the
final whistle blow, El Capitan was
going strong and might have reversed
the results if given a little more time.
Ray Doughty, running guard for S.
A. E., showed up as the best player.
He threw four baskets and dribbled
the ball within striking distance re
peatedly. Dickey generaled the team
and played a good game at forward.
White, El Capitan forward, resembled
a small whirlwind in action, and he
shared equally with Walker, the other
forward, twelve of the fifteen points.
Alpha Delta Phi, with practically
the same team which won the cham
pionship last year, swamped the Alpha
Sigma players by a score of 27 to 5.
Gerson made fourteen of the total
number of points. His game was de
cidedly too individual, being too fast
to permit much passing. Neer played
steadily, while Crains demonstrated
special speed and accuracy. Loomis,
at guard, looked like excellent var
sity material. Alpha Sigma Phi's best
bet was Welsh.
Encina Fourth Floor won more or
less of a practice game, only two of
the regular off-campus players being
on the opposing pick-up team. The
score was 8 to 2.
