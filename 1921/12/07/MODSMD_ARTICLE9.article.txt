Members of Nestoria Debating So

three-man team to meet Euphronia
next quarter, this evening at 7:36 in
Room 12, of the Law Building. This
debate, scheduled for January 21, will
be first contest in the Intercollegiate
Debating Society League. Every Nes
toria member is urged to be present
to take part in the try outs. Each try
outee will be given five minutes.
The subject is, "Resolved, that Con

same as that chosen for the tri-state
debate in the spring quarter, and on
this account Debating Coach Emerson
suggests that everyone wishing to try
out for Stanford's team in that con
test be present to hear the discussion
this evening.
