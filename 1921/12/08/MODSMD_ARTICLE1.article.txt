# JUNIORS LEAD IN INTERIM MAT TEAM CONTESTS
## D. Johnson Throws Londell in Best Match of Afternoon, Bailard Beats Melchronian 
### 
'J lie finals in the interclass wrestling
tournament were reached yesterday
when twelve men met to decide the
class winner this year. The Juniors lead
by virtue of three victories, but two
more bouts have to be settled before any
body can be acclaimed winner.
Both Vaughn Hosepian, wrestling in
structor, and Coach Harry Maloney,
who has taken temporary charge of
wrestling in the absence of Athletic Di
rector Walter Powell, expressed them
selves as being well pleased with the re
sults of the tournament. According to
Hosepian, the team this year is stronger
than that of last, for there are more men
out and these men are more experienced.
Already a match with the Olympic Club
has been arranged for the beginning of
the winter quarter. This preliminary
match will give the varsity a chance
to show its metal before the final contcst
with the Bruins, which is scheduled to
take place the last of the quarter.
The contest between D. Johnson, '23,
and Londell, '25, was probably the best
yesterday, for action was fast and
furious and for a time it was a question
as to who would emerge the victor.
Johnson settled this point when he se
cured an arm scissors hold and forced
Londell to quit. As D. Johnson and
Mercer, '22, could not settle their dis
pute in the regular time appointed, it
was extended to five minutes. At the
end of the tussle neither man had thrown
the other, but Johnson, because of his
greater aggressiveness, was awarded the
decision.
Tomorrow two bouts, one between, '23,
and Montgomery. '22, in the 145-pound
class; and the other between McKee, '22,
and Boyle, '24, 168-pounders, will close
the tournament. The last mentioned
bout promises to be unusually interesting
for both men are thoroughly experi
enced, McKee having captained the box
ing and wrestling teams at Annapolis,
and Boyle having had experience in an
eastern prep school.
The first match yesterday between
Rothchild, '25. and Sturm, '23, Im
pounders, resulted in an easy victory for
the latter. Sturm had the bout his own
way from beginning to end, and was at
no time threatened by his less experi
enced opponent. Somebody must have
been feeding him raw meat, for he, not
being satisfied with this victory, tackled
the winner of the 125-pound class, Pal
lette, '25, who defeated Holbrook, '25.
Sturm forced Pallette to give up by
means of a half-nelson and scissors hold.
"Bevo" liailard, '24, and Melchronian,
'23, tussled for the three full minutes
before the former threw his opponent
with the aid of an arm lock. The men
are 135-pounders. Montgomery, '22, by
means of his aggressiveness, won a vic
tory over Proctor, '24. A chancery hold
put the quietus on Proctor. Montgomery
will be required to meet Lane, '23, before
he can claim championship to "the 145-
pound class.
