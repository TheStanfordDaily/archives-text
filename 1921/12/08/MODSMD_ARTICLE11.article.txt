# DR. A. D. BROWNE TO REPRESENT WEST AT FOOTBALL MEETING
## 
### 
Dr. A. D. Browne, vice-president of
the National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion, will attend the annual conference
in New York City, December 28 and 29.
Dr. Browne was recently re-elected to
the Executive Committee of the Associa
tion.
The Executive Committee of three
men has the power of choosing all mem
bers of the Rules Committee of fifteen
members from various sections of the
United States. Dr. Browne's election
to this committee last year was the re
sult of five years' labor as the repre
sentative of the western states to secure
recognition of the Pacific Coast in na
tional football circles. After he became
a member of the Executive Committee,
Walter Powell, coach of the 1920 team,
was appointed as the Pacific Coast rep
resentative on the Rules Committee. As
all other sports already had representa
tives, the appointment of Powell made
the west a factor in all sports.
This year Dr. Browne again hopes to
secure the appointment of a Pacific
Coast man on the Rules Committee,
which will secure the recognition of
Pacific Coast football permanently, it is
believed.
California and some of the northern
colleges are planning to have representa
tives at the convention, but Dr. Browne
is the official representative of the west
ern states, because of his membership
on the Executive Committee.
The men at present representing the
Pacific Coast in various sports are:
Track and field, A. D. Browne, Stan
ford; basketball, Fred Bohler, Washing
ton State; American football, Walter
Powell, Stanford; soccer, W. Dyment,
Oregon University; boxing, H. W. Ma
loney, Stanford; fencing, M. Trieb, Cali
fornia; swimming, E. Brandsten, Stan
ford; wrestling, J. Arbuthnot, Wash
ington University.
