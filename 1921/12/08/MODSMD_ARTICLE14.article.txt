# TELEGRAM URGES NEED OF EUROPEAN RELIEF
## 
### 
"The attempt to raise funds on the
campus for the benefit of the Europe
an students comes in answer to a tele
graphic call which is urgent and piti
ful in its desperate need," Professor
Fairclough, the local treasurer, said
in an interview today.
"At Stanford," he continued "we
wanted to defer the campaign until
after Christmas, realizing the over
whelming number of appeals which
have already been made this quarter.
A telegram from David R. Porter, the
New York secreteary, urged the abso
lute necessity of collecting funds be
fore the first of the year. So string
ent are the needs of the World Stu
dent Christian Federation, which is
carrying on the work of student relief,
that its chairman, John R. Mott, was
forced to cable to foreign representa
tives to discontinue active work until
enough contributions had come in to
insure against the Incurrence of debt.
Last year Herbert Hoover sent a
similar call for $1,000,000 to be used
by the American Relief Administration
for universities and colleges. Stan
ford answered with $4,000. This year
the demand is only for half that
amount, but it must be collected lest
the value of previous work be lost
Gradually America will be able to
withdraw from European Relief, but it
cannot be done too suddenly, and it
can not be done yet.
In speaking of the assembly of yes
terday, Professor Fairclough said
that he though the situation in Eu
rope and its relation to Stanford had
been admirably brought out, and that
the actual donations were needed now
to demonstrate the sincerity of our
efforts. "At Yale," he said, "the stu
dents have pledged themselves and
are averaging $15 per student. Great
Britain, where government taxation
alone is more than $100 per capita,
they are yet able to donate for Eu
ropean student relief.
"They feel, as every nation must
feel, that unless the universities are
kept alive for their work of preparing
teachers, doctors, and other pro
fessional men, reconstruction will not
only stop but will go backwards. One
of the greatest difficulties confronting
new governments, is the lack of train
ed, intelligent men to fall back on."
Professor Fairclough asks that not
only the students, but the faculty and
friends of the University should con
tribute to the fund. Pledges are ac
ceptable for those who feel that they
can not give actual money now. All
subscriptions may be broughe in, both
by individuals and by living group
captains, to his office, Room 257, op
posite the Library. Deposits for the
fund may also be made at the Palo
Alto Bank.
