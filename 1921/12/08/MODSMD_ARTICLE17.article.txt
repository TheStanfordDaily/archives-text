# VARSITY COURT SQUAD TO STOP PRACTICE FRIDAY
## Final Examinations Put Stop to Workouts This Quarter; Anderson Showing up Well 
### 
Varsity basketball practice will not
be continued this quarter after Fri
day's workout on account of final ex
aminations, Coach Gene Van Gent has
announced.
The Cardinal mentor has made two
cuts in his squad and last night had
his forty candidates running through
formations on the court at the En
cina gymnasium.
Van Gent had not figured to make
any cuts in his squad before the end
of the quarter but with such a large
number of men reporting for prac
tices. he found such a move necessary
in order to follow the work ol' the
men more closely.
Captain Jimmy Davies watched the
practice last night from the side-lines.
He will be ready to get into suit and
work out with the squad after the holi
days.
Indications are that Van Gent will
depend on a fast and tricky offensive
in his games this year as he had his
men shooting the ball in long passing
rushes last night.
Fred Anderson, a substitute last sea
son, has impressed the basketball
fans already by his showing in prac
tice. He looks to be a real contender
for one of the forward positions or
else running guard. Anderson is fast
and he was shooting baskets in mid
season form last night.
"Dud" DeGroot, captain-elect of the
football team next season, is another
man who has been showing up well
in the varsity workouts. DeGroot is
big and rangy and has had plenty of
experience at the court pastime.
At present "Lefty" Rogers and Dick
Richmond are the only letter men out
for practice. Both men were going
good last night.
Hint Howell who played center on
his freshman team, has reported for
practice and looks like a condender
for the team.
Alabaster, a member of last year's
freshman organization, showed up
well in the workouts last night.
Stanford will be weakened by the
loss of Righter, Mills and Adams, from
last year's championship five. That is
admitted. But those who have watch
ed Van Gent's squad in practice be
lieve that there is excellent material
on hand for a winning combination
this year.
