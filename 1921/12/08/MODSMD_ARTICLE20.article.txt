The United States Government has placed at Stan
ford a field artillery unit of the Reserve Ofticers'
Training Corps. As the name implies, the organiza
tion of these units throughout the colleges of the
United States is designed to give college men the
training which will enable them to serve as officers
of the military forces of our country in time of na
tional need.
The R. O. T. C.is distinctly a democratic institu
tion, carrying out the American ideal that we should
never maintain a large standing army, one of the
greatest enemies of world peace, but should instead
maintain only a minimum force, providing for pro
tection through the establishment of a reserve in
which men engaged in peaceful avocations might yet
he fitted for the defense of their country, should the
agression of any other power make that necessary
The Stanford Unit is maintained at the cost of
many thousands of dollars each year. Three army
ofticers have been detailed to instruct those enrolled
in the course. Ninety horses and a most complete
assemblage of equipment are maintained for instruc
tion purposes.
While primarily designed to train men as reserve
officers, the military course is replete with instruc
tion which is of benefit to men in any walk of life.
Hygiene, sanitation, and first aid, as taught in the
theoretical course, are of immense personal value to
anyone. Horsemanship, with accompanying instruc
tion in the care of the animals, is of use to many,
especially those who will take agriculture as their
profession. The course in the construction, care,
and operation of tractors and gas engines is one
which can not fail to commend itself to any who will
ever be called upon to operate motor vehicles in civil
life, or who are mechanically inclined.
The practical work in the field is invaluable for its
physical training, and the disciplining of the body
so that it will give instant response to the commands
of the mind.
Some perhaps have passed the R. O. T. C. by, be
lieving that its activities would conflict with partici
pation in University athletics. The military depart
ment in the case of football has ruled that men on
the football squad who were enrolled in the R. C).
T. C. might substitute football in lieu of the practical
military course. Major Collins stands ready to ex
tend this co-operation to other forms of athletics.
Polo, and rifle and pistol shooting are being fos
tered by the military department. The summer
camps, conducted at Camp Knox, Tenn., to which
Stanford men of the R. O. T. C. unit are sent at
government expense every year, is a worth-while ex
cursion and offers an opportunity to those who wish
to see more of the United States, and who desire a
good vacation.
Upon completion of the full course in the Stan
military course are furnished by the government.
Those who take the advanced course are paid by the
government, and student officers in addition receive
a salary from the University.
Upon completion of the full cousre in the Stan
ford R. O. T. C. unit, the student may be commis
sioned as a second lieutenant in the reserve forces.
He will be in the reserve for a period of five years
after his commission is granted. Renewal of the
commission after this period is optional. It is pos
sible to be commissioned in the regular army, if the
student desires.
Men of Stanford who wish to gain knowledge of
practical value in every-day life, who wish to have
fun in outdoor activities, and who have a patriotic
desire to fit themselves for the service of their coun
try if occasion demanded would do well to investi
gate the possibilities of the Stanford Unit of the
R. O. T. C.
