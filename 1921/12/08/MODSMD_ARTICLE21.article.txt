Dear Head of Cabbages:—The time has come, your
Thursday says, to talk of many things. Because I wrote
a little ditty in this column about the value of using
Fords for kissing and have made considerable, if I may
put it that strongly, mention of the short-end of the 22-5
campus ratio I have been the target of jealousy and
envy. By an insidious, persistent campaign my fellow
colyumnists would have the public believe I speak from
experience, albeit the true nobility of my character
was revealed last week when I declined to take up
with such a low-brow celebration as that conducted by
the Purple Parrot.
But don't think, Monday and Tuesday, you frighten
me off the subject. I know my character is safe and
so today in revenge will discuss the kissing topic de
termined to give the final word, the most expert ad
vice. My character is safe because anybody with a
grain of sense knows the fellows who talk about such
subjects are not the active ones. Any girl knows from
experience that fellows who write poetry are as slow
as Hamlet. If Carl ever caught me in a game of "Post
office" he'd be so surprised he'd lose 98 honor points
before he'd recover from the shock, and Hal would be
so ossified all the Camelline in the world wouldn't help.
The make-up man of the D. P. A., your Thursday Sec
tion Boss, has learnt from the printing trade the follow
ing about the kissing game:

(Credit four to exchanges, last to Boss.)
TYPOGRAPHICAL
To print a kiss upon her lips
He thought the time was ripe;
But when he went to press she said,
"I do not like your type."
A kiss he printed on her lips
And showed her no contrition.
Because the artful minx inquired
"Well, when's the next edition?"
A kiss he printed on her lips
And she made this oration:
"Please, please, continue doing that!
It boosts my circulation!"
A kiss he printed on her lips,
A little time to take up;
But she repulsed when she said:
"I do not like your make-up."
"Your make-up seemea an ngnt," said she,
But when you went to press'
I felt it 'binding' and so we
Must try again, I guess."
* * *
Finally, the Boss confesses authorship of the most
valuable hint on kissing yet presented at Stanford, his
pome in the October, 1919, Chaparral:
* * * ———■
HOW TO MAKE A DAUGHTER OF STANFORD RED
Ah, she had dazzling golden hair.
Her eyes were wondrous blue,
She made a U. C. maiden fair
But I'm L. S. J. U.;
Ah, then I spied a cupid's bow,
The color I love so well,
I kisser her, and what do you know? —
She turned to Cardinal.
* » *
Whaddyuhsay, Hal and Carl? Come one, come all, the
rouge shall fall on your sweet lips before on mine!
• * *
No, I am not a member of Euphronia.
• • *
How he scolded the women, this gent from Euphronia,
"Oh, whither," he ranted, "are Law Steps goin' to."
Then he sipped him his tea, ate marshmallows three,
and murmured, "Great where the Dames' Club grow
in' to!"
* ♦ *
California is looking for competition in horseshoe. We
can't play 'em that. We'd have about as much chance
as we'd have in a cross-country run in search of four
leaf clovers.
• • *
Anyway, it is to be hoped that tne University Press
will take up the challenge. Those lucky birds could
play rings around Cal.
• * *
Let's send the Cal symbol to the blacksmith. In other
words, shoo the Golden Bear.
• • *
Humor for high-brows:—Saw Foch Saturday. First
impression: Looks just like he did in the 'Daily' cigar
ette ads. Second Impress: That's a low-brow reaction.
Third Imp: Well, it'll make a Cabbage, anyway.
• • *
"Lawd, man, when he done hit dat line dere's a hole
like dem Jack Johnson's used to make on de French
front and if he hits yourn you sure got shell shock an'
maybe worse. And den, lawdy, massa, dey call him
'Dud.' If he am a 'dud' Stanford must flgger a high
'splosive oughta send de Campanile in one lick like
Flint Hanner's javelin thru dis her Betelgeuse."
* * *
Last summer, tennis Captain Phil Neer, won the na
tional intercollegiate title, so there was nothing left for
Captain Bates of Cal to do but to go up and grab off
the Canadian national title. This fall Cal takes the
national football gonfalon from us by winning the con
ference race, so i suppose in return it's up to us to
send our rugby footballers up and take the Canadian
chapionship.

Dear Head of Cabbages:—The time has come, your
Thursday says, to talk of many things. Because I wrote
a little ditty in this column about the value of using
Fords for kissing and have made considerable, if I may
put it that strongly, mention of the short-end of the 22-5
campus ratio I have been the target of jealousy and
envy. By an insidious, persistent campaign my fellow
colyumnists would have the public believe I speak from
experience, albeit the true nobility of my character
was revealed last week when I declined to take up
with such a low-brow celebration as that conducted by
the Purple Parrot.
But don't think, Monday and Tuesday, you frighten
me off the subject. I know my character is safe and
so today in revenge will discuss the kissing topic de
termined to give the final word, the most expert ad
vice. My character is safe because anybody with a
grain of sense knows the fellows who talk about such
subjects are not the active ones. Any girl knows from
experience that fellows who write poetry are as slow
as Hamlet. If Carl ever caught me in a game of "Post
office" he'd be so surprised he'd lose 98 honor points
before he'd recover from the shock, and Hal would be
so ossified all the Camelline in the world wouldn't help.
The make-up man of the D. P. A., your Thursday Sec
tion Boss, has learnt from the printing trade the follow
ing about the kissing game:

(Credit four to exchanges, last to Boss.)
TYPOGRAPHICAL
To print a kiss upon her lips
He thought the time was ripe;
But when he went to press she said,
"I do not like your type."
A kiss he printed on her lips
And showed her no contrition.
Because the artful minx inquired
"Well, when's the next edition?"
A kiss he printed on her lips
And she made this oration:
"Please, please, continue doing that!
It boosts my circulation!"
A kiss he printed on her lips,
A little time to take up;
But she repulsed when she said:
"I do not like your make-up."
"Your make-up seemea an ngnt," said she,
But when you went to press'
I felt it 'binding' and so we
Must try again, I guess."
* * *
Finally, the Boss confesses authorship of the most
valuable hint on kissing yet presented at Stanford, his
pome in the October, 1919, Chaparral:
* * * ———■
HOW TO MAKE A DAUGHTER OF STANFORD RED
Ah, she had dazzling golden hair.
Her eyes were wondrous blue,
She made a U. C. maiden fair
But I'm L. S. J. U.;
Ah, then I spied a cupid's bow,
The color I love so well,
I kisser her, and what do you know? —
She turned to Cardinal.

No, I am not a member of Euphronia.

"Oh, whither," he ranted, "are Law Steps goin' to."

California is looking for competition in horseshoe. We
can't play 'em that. We'd have about as much chance
as we'd have in a cross-country run in search of four

Her eyes were wondrous blue,
She made a U. C. maiden fair
But I'm L. S. J. U.;
Ah, then I spied a cupid's bow,
The color I love so well,
I kisser her, and what do you know? —
She turned to Cardinal.

A GOOD END-LINE: "A" IN THE FINALS.

Carl Shoup, Monday Conductor,
Hal Rorke, Tuesday Dispatcher.
Phil Newill, Wednesday Engineer.
S. G. Trimble, Thursday Section Boss.
Henry Mack, In Friday Caboose
Dear Head of Cabbages:—The time has come, your
Thursday says, to talk of many things. Because I wrote
a little ditty in this column about the value of using
Fords for kissing and have made considerable, if I may
put it that strongly, mention of the short-end of the 22-5
campus ratio I have been the target of jealousy and
envy. By an insidious, persistent campaign my fellow
colyumnists would have the public believe I speak from
experience, albeit the true nobility of my character
was revealed last week when I declined to take up
with such a low-brow celebration as that conducted by
the Purple Parrot.
But don't think, Monday and Tuesday, you frighten
me off the subject. I know my character is safe and
so today in revenge will discuss the kissing topic de
termined to give the final word, the most expert ad
vice. My character is safe because anybody with a
grain of sense knows the fellows who talk about such
subjects are not the active ones. Any girl knows from
experience that fellows who write poetry are as slow
as Hamlet. If Carl ever caught me in a game of "Post
office" he'd be so surprised he'd lose 98 honor points
before he'd recover from the shock, and Hal would be
so ossified all the Camelline in the world wouldn't help.
The make-up man of the D. P. A., your Thursday Sec
tion Boss, has learnt from the printing trade the follow
ing about the kissing game:

(Credit four to exchanges, last to Boss.)
TYPOGRAPHICAL
To print a kiss upon her lips
He thought the time was ripe;
But when he went to press she said,
"I do not like your type."
A kiss he printed on her lips
And showed her no contrition.
Because the artful minx inquired
"Well, when's the next edition?"
A kiss he printed on her lips
And she made this oration:
"Please, please, continue doing that!
It boosts my circulation!"
A kiss he printed on her lips,
A little time to take up;
But she repulsed when she said:
"I do not like your make-up."
"Your make-up seemea an ngnt," said she,
But when you went to press'
I felt it 'binding' and so we
Must try again, I guess."
