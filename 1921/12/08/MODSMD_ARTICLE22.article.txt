Dear Editor:
As one who has always been inter
ested, an active participant and a firm
believer in the merits of debating as a
college activity, I must voice my dis
approval of the sentiment of the article
which appeared in yesterday's issue un
der this column in regard to the write
up of the Stanford-California debate of
December 2d.
The article was signed "The Debating
Team/' but I should be disappointed to
think it represented the sentiments of
and was really written by the whole
team. Having attended the debate my
self, I submit to you that it was a fair
and accurate write-up and I cannot
avoid a feeling that the article was the
expression of the sentiment of a single
member of the team, whose avarice for
self-praise is so strong as to arouse, his
antagonism toward any one who might
not share his sentiments, and who is not
a good enough sport to face what I con
sider a very fair statement as to his per
formance and go on to the next debate
to profit by the criticism of his work in
the last one.
I certainly believe that due credit
should be given to participants in all
forms of college activity through the.
medium of the "Daily," but I do not
believe in a policy of its reporters de
parting from fair statements of the case
in order to cast personal bouquets to
participants in any contest or sport.
As to the absence of the reporter from
the debate, and the article having been
written from imagination, I have only
to say that if this was the case his imag
ination was strangely accurate, for I
heard the debate and as a whole I con
sider the article a very accurate account
and in my judgment, due credit was
given to the work and showing of the
team. The comparison of the two teams
was timely and the characterization of
the work of the individual speakers rep
resented the opinion of the majority of
the audience. As to the presence of the
reporter at the Sohpomore Cotillion, a
glance down the column of the cotillion
ticket purchasers should have recom
mended itself to the writer, as a good
debater, before making such an imagina
tive assertion.
I sincerely trust that the staff and re
porters will not take that article as a
representation of the attitude, of the de
baters or of those interested or sponsor
ing debating in general. All we ask of
you is a just recognition of our activity
as such, a fair and creditable comment
on the work of our representatives, when
such is deserved, and we do not ask that
you lend your columns as ii medium of
personal aggrandizement of individual
members in contravention of fair and
meritorious comment.

which appeared in yesterday's issue un
der this column in regard to the write
up of the Stanford-California debate of
December 2d.
The article was signed "The Debating
Team/' but I should be disappointed to
think it represented the sentiments of
and was really written by the whole
team. Having attended the debate my
self, I submit to you that it was a fair
and accurate write-up and I cannot
avoid a feeling that the article was the
expression of the sentiment of a single
member of the team, whose avarice for
self-praise is so strong as to arouse, his
antagonism toward any one who might
not share his sentiments, and who is not
a good enough sport to face what I con
sider a very fair statement as to his per
formance and go on to the next debate
to profit by the criticism of his work in
the last one.
I certainly believe that due credit
should be given to participants in all
forms of college activity through the.
medium of the "Daily," but I do not
believe in a policy of its reporters de
parting from fair statements of the case
in order to cast personal bouquets to
participants in any contest or sport.
As to the absence of the reporter from
the debate, and the article having been
written from imagination, I have only
to say that if this was the case his imag
ination was strangely accurate, for I
heard the debate and as a whole I con
sider the article a very accurate account
and in my judgment, due credit was
given to the work and showing of the
team. The comparison of the two teams
was timely and the characterization of
the work of the individual speakers rep
resented the opinion of the majority of
the audience. As to the presence of the
reporter at the Sohpomore Cotillion, a
glance down the column of the cotillion
ticket purchasers should have recom
mended itself to the writer, as a good
debater, before making such an imagina
tive assertion.
I sincerely trust that the staff and re
porters will not take that article as a
representation of the attitude, of the de
baters or of those interested or sponsor
ing debating in general. All we ask of
you is a just recognition of our activity
as such, a fair and creditable comment
on the work of our representatives, when
such is deserved, and we do not ask that
you lend your columns as ii medium of
personal aggrandizement of individual
members in contravention of fair and
meritorious comment.
