Dear Editor: With all due reverence
to the dramatic abilities of the gentle
men who composed the wicked superla
tive in your columns last evening, permit
one of lowly station and unbiased view
to remark that the attack on the "wily"
D. P. A. reporter was wholly unjustified.
The "surprise and chagrin" of the mem
bers of the illustrious forensic trio
could be experienced, as well as mani
fested, in more ways than one. Al
though one is forced to agree that in
order to give the most truthful report
of an event, the press representative
should be present, it is at the same time
apparent to the casual observer that the
reporter need hear no more than pre
liminary presentation of argument to
gain his views. In other words, once is
enough. If sheer flattery is what the
trio desires, it never entered the "intel
lectual contest" in the proper spirit. A
reporter who signs his name has the
right to present his opinions as he sees
fit. Had he been present at the debate,
the "criticisms and condemnations con
cocted by the wily reporter after he re
turned from his pleasure," would prob
ably have not been so generously inter
spersed with praise; nor would he have
been in any frame of mind to make a
written concession.
It makes little difference what activity
one participates in, criticism is to be ex
pected. There was no indication at the
debate in question that all speakers
were above reproach. The reporter
drew his conclusions from his knowl
edge of the criticized parties and from
the views of his assistant who covered
the contest. He would have needed no
assistant. The judges' decision and his
own convictions as to the abilities of
the respective orators were enough. He
could have gone much further in his
really scanty criticism and still have
stuck with the truth. It would not be
amiss for the disgruntled, somewhat
startled, and admittedly "chagrined"
trio to give credit to the critic.
SAUREY I. WENTT.
