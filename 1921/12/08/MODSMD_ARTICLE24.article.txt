## 
### 
Dr. Girl L. Alsbcrg, director of the
Stanford Food Institute, spoke before
the Classical Club in the Women's Club
house last evening. He compared agri
culture methods of classical times with
modern ideas.
Greeks and Romans had a more
limited diet than we have today, the
speaker explained, due to their primi
tive methods of farming and lack of
crop variety.
