# STANFORD'S VARSITY SOCCER TEAM NOT TO TAKE CANADIAN TRIP
## 
### 
That the Cardinal varsity soccer squad
will not invade Canadian territory this
season was definitely decided when
Coach Harry Maloney received a tele
gram from "Kon" Jones, a Canadian
promoter, which stated that while he
was prepared to offer a guarantee, he
was unable to arrange a schedule for the
Stanford team.
He gave no reason for his inability
to arrange for the games, but Harry Ma
loney believes that it was due to the fact
that the Cardinal rugby team be
playing in the same territory in which
the soccer team would play and that the
Canadian officials did not wish two in
ternational games there at the same
time. Maloney stated that if this was
the objection, he would arrange to meet
the Canadians in the English sport in
the spring vacation.
The soccer games that were to have

been playe/1 with "the University of Ore
gon and Oregon Agricultural College
will have to be called off or be post
poned. O. A. C., by virtue of its two
wins over Oregon this season, is ex
trcmely anxipus to meet Stanford for
the Coast championship, but feels un
able to meet the expense of bringing the
Cards north. The Aggies are now try
ing to arrange a schedule for the Stan
ford team, and it is yet possible that a
Cardinal eleven will journey up to Cor
vallis.
