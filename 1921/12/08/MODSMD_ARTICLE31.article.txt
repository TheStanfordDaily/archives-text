UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
BERKELEY, CAL., Dec. 8. (P. I. N. S.)
â€”Final plans have been completed
here for the Interfraternity Market
Association. This is a system of co
operative buying among organized
houses for the purpose of economy in
marketing, by which the contracts for
supplying all the organizations on the
campus with food stuffs are let to the
lowest bidder. Each house thereafter
orders from this wholesaler, through
the market association.
