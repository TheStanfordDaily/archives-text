WHITMAN COLLEGE, WALLA
WALLA, WASH., Dec. 8. (P. I. N. S.)
—That another agitation for sorority
houses at Whitman will be made this
spring is evident, as the matter was
brought up at the Pan-Hellenic Coun
cil this week for their discussion. It
is contended that the co-eds will be
able to live just as cheaply in sorority
houses as in the college dormitories.
It haß always been a rule of the col
lege administration that the women
could have sororities, but that they
must live in the regular dormitories.
This rule has been very unpopular
with the women.
