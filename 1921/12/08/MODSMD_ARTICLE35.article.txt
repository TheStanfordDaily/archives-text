UNIVERSITY OP CALIFORNIA,
BERKELEY, CAL., Dec. 8. (P. I. N.
S.) â€”Superficial attraction for a "white
collar" job was given by Professor J.
H. Hildebrand of the chemistry depart
ment, as one of the greatest failings
of students In their choice of their life
long careers. He believed that young
people choose their lives on too ob
jective a basis and is convinced that
many have taken up their work upon
some unconscious logic as: "Many
physicians have made a great deal of
money; I will be a physician, there
fore I will make a great (leal of
money'.
"The best thing that the University
can do for a student is not to give
him training for a single trade, but to
train him to think and act."
