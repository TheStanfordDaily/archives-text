IRISH PEACE NEAR
The Irish situation shares the front
page with the Disarmament Confer
ence. Moves looking toward ratifica
tion of the treaty are going forward.
The King is preparing to summon
Parliament for a session of several
days, and Dail Eireann has already
been convoked. Little opposition is
expected to ratification, either in Ire
land or England. The King has fed
the spirit of reconciliation by releas
ing four thousand Irish political pri
soners.
"FOUR POWER" AGREEMENT
At Washington it is reported that
Japan has consented to the "four
power" agreement which is to super
sede the Anglo-Japanese treaty. This
agreement will provide for acceptance
of the Hughes limitation of arma
ments scheme and for the cessation
of all further work upon fortifications
in Pacific Islands. The United States
insists, however, on the right to
further develop the fortifications of
Hawaii, although she is willing to
abandon the project for a fortified
naval base at Guam. An important
phase of the four power entente pro
posal is that it will help to conciliate
France, who fears isolation. It is
understood that no definite treaty of
alliance could pass the Senate, and
therefore the American delegation
cannot be prepared to offer such a
treaty, but will rather suggest an un
derstanding through the exchange of
notes.
VIOLENCE IN PACKERS' STRIKE
The strike of packing house employ
ees increases in bitterness. A number
of casualties occurred when the police
fired upon strikers and sympathisers
who were surrounding the packing
plants at Chicago. Injunctions against
picketing have been issued in Omaha
and other cities.
GERMAN REPARATIONS
European papers contain discussions
of the proposal of Hugo Stinners and
other great capitalists to offer their
credit and assistance to the German
Government in the payment of Repa
rations. Stinnes demands that the
railways, now owned by the Govern
ment undertake to keep its hands off
the conduct of industry and give him
free play. The Socialist and Labor
groups offer desperate resistance to
this proposal.
RHENISH PROVINCES
A movement is on foot in the Rhen
ish Provinces looking toward separa
tion from Germany and the creation
of an autonomous State. A conference
of the "Republican Separatist Party
of the Rhineland," held at Mayence,
was attended by 534 delegates. The
creation of such an autonomous buffer
state between France and Germany
would be in line with the desires of
France, as put forth at the Peace Con
ference and blocked by President Wil
son.

RHENISH PROVINCES
A movement is on foot in the Rhen
ish Provinces looking toward separa
tion from Germany and the creation
of an autonomous State. A conference
of the "Republican Separatist Party
of the Rhineland," held at Mayence,
was attended by 534 delegates. The
creation of such an autonomous buffer
state between France and Germany
would be in line with the desires of
France, as put forth at the Peace Con
ference and blocked by President Wil
son.
