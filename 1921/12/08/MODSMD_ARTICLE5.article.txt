# D.E. WOOD ADDRESSES JOURNALISTS' SOCIETY
## 
### 
"There is more life in metropolitan
reporting than in small-town journal
ism," Dallas E. Wood, '08, editor of
the Daily Palo Alto Times told the
American Journalists' Association last
night at Professor Everett W. Smith's
home. "Opposed to the thrill and ex
hiliration a reporter gets from the
realization that he is part of some
thing big, is the knowledge that he
is only part of it.
"In a small town, however, a news
paper man has a chance to amount to
considerable in the community. A vil
lage journalist is looked up to. Be
sides, the experience gained on a
small sheet is much broader. Carl
Anderson of the Chronicle told me
that his paper recruited the depart
ment heads from country newspapers
because they had a far wider vision
than the city-trained man. On a
small paper there is a chance to be
everything.
"The wages of a small-town reporter
has equalled that of the average city
man's in many cases. Furthermore,
the country reporter is in closer touch
with the community. His paper is
part of the social fabric whereas the
city paper is an individual institu
tion."
Wood said that the reason for the
low standard held by the rural p-ipers
is three-fold. In the first piace, the
editors are often in their positions
not because they are journalists, but
because they are printers. Then, it is
too easy to get by in a small town.
People are indulgent, possibly out of
local loyalty. Lastly, he said, too
many editors lack the backbone to re
ject unsuitable material which is
handed them in the form of contri
butions.
"College men, editors say, turn out
to be among the best rural journal
ists." Mr. Wood said, "After they
have learned to respect small news
items and have finally grasped the
exact thing the community wants,
they are usually successful."
A small daily can compete with an
imported city paper to great advant
age if it keeps on the right track, Mr.
Wood pointed out. The essential thing
that puts the country paper behind the
city edition, is the press service. The
rural communities do not want the
so-called "human interest" and feature
service but the essential telegraph
news. This, coupled with a volume
of small, local items is a formula
which, not only holds out against, but
even digs into a city paper's circu
lation.
