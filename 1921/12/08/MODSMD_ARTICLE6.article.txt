# NESTORIA TRY-OUTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN CHOOSING SQUAD
## 
### 
After speeches lasting an hour and a
half, Nestoria Debating Society last
night failed to agree on a team to rep
resent it in its clash with Euphronia
next month. The entire matter was put
over until Thursday, January sth, when
further try-outs will be held. The chief
difficulty was that, owing to pressure of
final examinations, some men were so
much better prepared than others that
fair comparison of ability proved diffi
cult.
B. L. Comparct, '24, alternate on the
varsity debating team, and Leland Stan
ford, '24, member of the second varsity,
showed such ability in rebuttal that their
places on the team are said to be almost
assured. R. R. Manger, '25. proved a
speaker that must be considered. B. E.
McCaffcry, '24, will be particularly val
uable if Nestoria is to debate the nega
tive. However, D. C. Webb, '24; H. W.
Dryden, '25, and S. R. Dows, '22, may
break up the slate at the next tryout.
Arrangements were perfected for the.
end-quarter banquet next Wednesday.
Rumor has it that the most sensational
criminal case of the century will be held
in the court chamber of Tagawa.
