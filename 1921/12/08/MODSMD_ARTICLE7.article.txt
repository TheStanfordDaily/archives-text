# GLEE CLUB MEMBERS WILL POSTPONE TOUR
## 
### 
Because only a limited time would be
available for the proposed trip of the
Glee Club to Chico, Sacramento, Stock
ton, Napa and Vallejo during the Christ
mas holidays, it has been practically de
cided to postpone the tour until later.
Some of the concerts may be given in
dividually on short week-end trips
throughout the year, as these places are
readily accessible.
The first public appearance of the Glee
Club this year will be Saturday, when a
short program will be given at the
alumni luncheon at the Stanford Union.
