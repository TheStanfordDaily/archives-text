# INTERCLASS BOXING TOURNAMENT REACHES SEMI-FINAL ROUND
## 
### 
Fast bouts marked the finishing of the
first round and beginning of the semi
finals in the interclass boxing tournament
at Encina gymnasium yesterday after
noon.
The matches were the best seen thus
far in the tournament and the schedule
for today and tomorrow promises even
better competition.
The first round closed with two fast
bouts. Bill Paine and Brad Simmons
fought a mean battle which was won by
Simmons. The milling was furious dur
ing the entire three rounds. Simmons
pressed the fight all the way and re
ceived a well-earned decision. He was
a varsity boxer last year and looks to
be in the best of condition for the com
ing season.
Hal Rorke and "Red" Bell tangled in
a match which was anybody's battle un
til the last round, when Bell's superior
condition allowed him to pile up a lead.
He got the decision.
Competition in the semi-finals was
keen. Earl Collins and Lewis Penwell
gave an excellent exhibition of toe-to-toe
fighting and the score was so even at the
end of the third round that they were
compelled to go another round. Pen
well, with a better wallop and in better
condition, won the decision. This was
the best bout of the day.
Kenny Shipp and Kalmen Sapero were
matched in a pretty exhibition of fast
footwork. The first two rounds were
fairly even, but in the final round Shipp's
wicked right found its mark so many
times that the bell alone saved Sapero
from a knockout. Shipp looks like good
varsity material. He is fast, carrier him
self well, is hard to hit, and packs a
dangerous blow in either mitt. His
right is especially wicked.
H. H. Wright and A. C. Becker, in
the last match of the day, clinched re
peatedly, but gave a good exhibition of
give and take fighting. Wright was
given the decision.
Bill Burkhardt and Jack Fishburn
boxed a one-round exhibition match.
Both men seem to be in the prime of
condition and ready to give battle, to the
best of them.
Howard Brown acted as referee in all
of the matches.
Tomorrow afternoon the semi-finals
will be continued with the following
matches: Shipp vs. Bell; Penwell vs.
Fishburn; Charles vs. Graham; and
Neill vs. Wright.
