# 'DREAM OF MARY' TO BE PRESENTED SUNDAY EVENING
## Horatio Parker's Oratorio to Be Presented First Time In West by a Local Cast 
### 
"The Dream of Mary" by Horatio
Parker, will be given for the first time
in the West, Sunday evening at 7:45
in the Stanford Memorial Church.
This beautiful oratorio is being pro
duced chiefly for the students (al
though the public will be admitted
after 7:30) and Dr. Gardner urges
every student to avail himself of tho
opportunity to witness it. Presenting
as it does, he says, a dignified and
reverent subject with a distinctly
spiritual appeal, it is a most approp
riate offering for the Christmas sea
son.
The work of the cast, which has
been selected to impersonate the bib
lical characters seen in the tableaux
of the mortality play, is being directed
by Coach Gordon Davis. Last night
at the close of the dress rehearsal he
expressed himself as quite pleased
with the progress made by the cast
so far. The final dress rehearsal will
be held next Sunday afternoon at 3
o'clock.
"The Dream of Mary" was first pro
duced at the Norfolk Music Festival
in Connecticut in June, 1918. It was
given in New York by the Columbia
Festival Chorus under Walter Henry
Hall, in August, 1919, and repeated
in Brooklyn in March, 1920. The work
was given recently at Yale University
as part of the memorial services for
Dr. Parker, who for many years was
head of the Music Department in that
institution.
Mrs. Guy S. Farrington will take the
part of the angel; Mrs. Ruth May
Friend and Mr. Redfield Sears, the
solos; and the Misses Maria Anderson,
Ruth Davis and Frances Phillips, the
trios. Dr. Gardner, Chaplain of the
University, has with the co-operation
of Mr. Gordon Davis selected a cast
of thirty people.
The whole work is said to be most
dignified, reverent, and beautiful, with
a spiritual appeal which makes it
most appropriate for the Christmas
season.
The children's chorus of seventy
voices is composed of children from
Miss Lockey's school and the Presby
terian Church, and will be under the
direction of Mrs. Armor and Miss Huff
