# JUNIOR WOMEN HOLD SENIORS TO TIE GAME
## 
### 
Although the senior women's hockey
team holds a record clear of any de
feat, the juniors through expert team
work and consistently fast play, held
it to a 1 to 1 tie, yesterday afternoon,
on the Roble field. The junior wom
en showed marked improvement bound
to result from the stiff workouts in
the practices staged on the hockey
fields every day this week. Team
work, the essential factor which marks
abundant knowledge of the technique
of the game, was as highly developed
on the part of the 23's as by the seni
ors.
For the duration of both halves the
teams came through with the strong
est play and most highly concerted
action ever displayed on Roble field
this season. No one player can be
singled out from either of the two
squads for conspicuous work, as every
woman played an important part in
the fine action of the teams. No
score was made in the first half, the
teams coming through with such
strong defense that neither could ring
a goal.
The second half was marked by par
ticularly fast play. The referee call
ed a goal for the seniors when Carey
Bailard shot for the netting at the
beginning of the half. The '23 wom
en piqued by the score, brought their
full fighting strength to the fore and
by the end of the second interval made
a goal in one of the prettiest plays
of the game. Hazel Churchman, left
inside, for the '23 squad, showed some
fast dribbling and shot the ball past
the senior defense into the cage.
About twenty-five women from San
Mateo High School were among the
rooters for the '22 team. Two games
will be played next week to decide the
championship. The senior-sopohomore
contest, on Tuesday, promises to be
one of the keenest of the season,
both teams having won or tied every
game so far and it will be to the ad
vantage of every woman in the Uni
versity who desires to see a good
game to come out and root at 4 o'clock.
