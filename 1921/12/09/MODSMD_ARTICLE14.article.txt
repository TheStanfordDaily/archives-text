# WOMEN ACCUSE MEN ON FIVE COUNTS IN JOINT DEBATE FRAY
## Wranglers-Euphronia Session Discusses Dress, Politics, Observation Posts of Men 
### 
Five accusations against men students
of Stanford were brought by women of
Wranglers Debating Society, and an
swered by Euphronia representatives, at
a joint meeting held in the Women's
Clubhouse last night. No decision was
rendered, but it was generally conceded
by both sides that Wranglers had the
best of the debate.
"Assembly Hall Traditions," dis
cussed by Mary Wildman, opened the
charges. Miss Wildman said that the
lirst few rows on the main floor should
be reserved for the women, this position
being chosen to give inspiration to the
speakers at assemblies. "We are even
willing to jump onto the backs of our
chairs at the Big Game rally in order
to gain our point," she declared.
S. S. Grossman, replying for the men,
stated that the women of the. University
were placed in a superior position by
the present arrangements, as they were
able at all times to look down upon the
male element.
Ruth Merrill began the talk 011 "The
Engineering Corner" by saying that men
were just as given to gossip as women.
"The major part of a college education,"
she said, "is the development of obser
vation. The Engineering Corner is the
best point of vantage for the purpose,
and we want to have the opportunity of
viewing the men from it, on an equal
basis." Women students will be pro
vided the wicker chairs, cretonne, cush
ions, and green and pink parasol- used
for the observation purposes, she de
clared.
E. V. Smith said in rebuttal that when
a group of men were seen gathered in a
knot, they were not necessarily gossip
ing, but might be discussing some deep
problem, such as the power of the. sun's
rays. There is nothing to keep women
from coming to the Engineers' Corner,
he said, but the Engineers should not be
deprived of their post of observation.
Speaking on "The Law Steps," Doro
thy Webster announced that it was
highly embarrassing to be applauded for
walking down the steps, and very in
convenient for those wishing to go to
the Library to walk around. John Field
said in refutation that the idea of the
applause was to give the newcomers a
cordial welcome, and that it would be
very simple to get to the Library by
nimbly jumping off,the walk, or by the
installation of a chutes.
"The Way Men Dress" was next
brought up for discussion by Kathryn
Donald. The reason women students
are accused of snubbing men, she said,
was because their three-day beards and
unkept costumes made them unrecog
nizable. "Cords contain the entire his
tory of the wearers," she stated, and
enumerated a few of the symbols which
appear on them, and thus add to the
chaos, E. D. Landels argued in rebut
tal that the men are worked so hard
they have to put on work clothes, and
that it is the natural primitive instinct
for self-decoration which gives rise to
the puzzle pictures.
The final subject, "The Attitude of
Men Towards Women,' 'was taken by
Ruth Jameson. Two points were made,
to the effect that women students were
practically excluded from politics, and
that men do not support women's ath
leticsâ€”such as turning out for hockey
matches.
L. B. Minsky replied to these argu
ments by suggesting that a suffragist
party be formed at once, and by accept
ing the invitation to be present at
women's sports. He added, "if the
women want a place of observation from
which to view men students, nothing
could be better than the Library steps,
which have a broad walk in front, where
jacks, hopscotch, and other sports could
be played."
The speakers for each side were intro
duced by Frances Sheldon, president of
Wranglers, and Ellis Hirschfeld, presi
dent of Euphronia.
At a business meeting of Euphronia
held previous to the joint session, Ellis
Hirschfeld was re-elected president, Her
bert Alexander re-elected vice-president,
and Mathew Tobriner made, secretary
treasurer in place of Louis Minsky, who
refused re-nomination.
