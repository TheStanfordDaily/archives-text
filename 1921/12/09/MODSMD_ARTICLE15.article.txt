# Cardinal Rugby Team Plays All-Stars On Local Field Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby team will play an
all-star combination from Palo Alto on
the turf field tomorrow afternoon at
2:30 o'clock.
This will be the first and last rugby
contest played at Stanford this year and,
consequently, will present the only op
portunity for those interested in the
game to witness the Cardinal team in
action. A special invitation to attend
the game has been issued to Stanford
alumni who will be on the campus Sat
urday.
After the game a committee com
posed of Dave Wallace, Captain "Teny"
Lynn, and Coach Harry Maloney will
select the team which will play at Van
couver, B. C., during the Christinas holi
days. Since the players will be chosen
largely according to their showing in
the game Saturday, a hot battle is ex
pected. Fifteen players and three sub
stitutes will probably make up the squad
on the northern trip.
