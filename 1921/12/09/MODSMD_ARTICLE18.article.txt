# INTERCLASS BOXING BOUTS FAST; FINALS TO BEGIN ON MONDAY
## 
### 
A1 Charles defeated Graham in the
only bout of the interclass tournament
held yesterday afternoon. The match
was fast and well fought. Both men
exhibited some fast footwork and a wil
lingness to mix, which made the bout
an exceedingly interesting one. Graham
led the bout during the first two rounds,
but Charles made such a showing in the
third round that an extra round was
fought, and the decision given to
Charles.
The schedule for this afternoon was as
follows: Shipp vs. Bell; Penwell vs.
Fishburn; Neill vs. Wright; L. H. Dills
vs. A. J. Mason; B. Adams vs. Shoen
i hair.
Monday will see the beginning of the
finals in the tournament. Murphy, who
was a welterweight at Annapolis, and
who is in his first year at Stanford, will
be matched against the winner of the
Wright vs. Neill bout. Murphy looks to
be a dangerous man with the mitts, and
is promising varsity material.
