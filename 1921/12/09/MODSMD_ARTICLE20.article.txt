# Returning Alumni.
## 
### 
Forty alumni, among whom are presidents of
Stanford Alumni Clubs from all sections of the
United States and members of practically every class
in the history of the University, have returned to the
campus. They have made a tour of inspection of the
Lane Medical School and of the local campus; they
will be dined by the Board of Trustees during theiv
short stay; but these are not the reasons for their
return to Stanford.
They have been called into conference with repre
sentatives of the Board of Trustees. President Wil
bur, and members of the faculty for the purpose of
formulating and discussing future policies of the
University. They will discuss the matter of salaries
for the teaching staff of the University. Other
problems of import will be discussed and future ac
tion mapped out.
Their return at this time entails a sacrifice of both
time and money on the part of practically every one
of the forty. They have left business and families
to make a long journey to the campus at the behest
of their Alma Mater.
The undergraduate body as well as the Board of
Trustees, the officers of the University, and the fac
ulty is host to them. They return at a time when
there are no athletic contests, no social affairs or
other functions to entertain them. They have re
turned on a matter of University business. We owe
a debt to these forty alumni members as well as all
alumni whose advice and aid is being constantly
sought in the direction of University affairs.
The* have returned on a matter of business. It
is ou duty to show them and tell them about the
Stanford of today. This is the same University that
they knew, but conditions have changed with the
time, and we have many things to tell our older
brothers who have returned home.
