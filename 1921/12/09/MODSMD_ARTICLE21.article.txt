# Christmas Concert.

"A man who hath no music in his soul is fit for
treasons, strategems, and spoils."
We see that even in Shakespeare's day the value
of an appreciation of music was recognized. Through
all the history of mankind there seems to be some
thing in the effect of music which expresses a need
or desire of the human being. Hence, we here at
Stanford from time to time are accorded opportuni
ties of listening to the compositions of worthy com
posers.
These have taken the form of organ recitals in the
Memorial Church, in choral work by the choir and
the Glee Club, and in concerts by outside organizar
tions, such as the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra.
An art akin to music in its humanizing value is
that of dramatic expression, and the campus has de
veloped many promising dramatists.
On Sunday evening at the Memorial Chapel, Stan
ford students and friends will have an opportunity
of hearing all these agencies, musical and dramatic,
combined in a presentation of a famous oratorio and
play. It is an unusual opportunity, and the produc
tion is sufficiently unusual to command the attention
of every Stanford student and music lover.
Students are to be given the preference in admis
sion to the chapel at 7 :30 Sunday evening. It will
be a sad evidence of a "don't care" spirit which will
keep any Stanford student away from the presenta
tion of the "Dream of Mary."
