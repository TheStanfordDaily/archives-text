# Paid For.

Stanford's stadium has been paid for, and it did
not cost $210,000 as was at first estimated. The
announcement by the Hoard of Athletic Control that
the total cost to date is $204,639.32 comes as an
other surprise. We are all well acquainted with the
story of the stadium and how it was constructed. It
developed as an immense project that would take a
number of years to complete. Following upon the
heels of this came the word that a stadium would be
built for the 1921 Big Game that would seat 65,000

and would cost $210,000. In some quarters this was
regarded as preposterous.
The stadium was built and the first game of
American football has been played in it to the won
derment of 59,000 visitors. Now comes the an
nouncement that the stadium has been paid for at a
figure that is almost $6,000 below the estimated cost.
The original cost was to include the bare construc
tion of the stadium, yet a drinking water system,
ticket booths, information bureaus, a scoreboard,
flagpoles, and the planting of the slopes of the bowl
have all been provided in the last total cost, which is
less by several thousand dollars than the original
figures.
Another item will lessen even this last cost. Baker
and Carpenter, the engineers in charge of the work,
who are both Stanford graduates, will return to the
stadium fund as a gift in accordance with their
pledges at the beginning, two per cent of their fees.
This will amount to about $600. Their donation is
in line with the gift of Professor Wing, who de
signed the stadium.
It is a source of satisfaction to know that the sta
dium has been paid for. WÂ£ have all admired and
wondered at the project and its rapid consummation,
but the news that it has been paid for within the year
is one thing we had not looked for from the Board
of Athletic Control.
