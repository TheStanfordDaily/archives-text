Haw! Haw!!
Laugh, and the world laughs with you,
Laugh, and you laugh alone.
The first when the joke's the teacher's,
The last when the joke's your own.

WAR! WAR!! WAR!!—Is hereby declared on the
Thursday section boss, for copping off our perfectly good
idea about printing kisses. However, as the barber
remarked when he sliced his customer, "That's no skin
off my nose."

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday are all for

Taking the Wait Out of Waist
People talk of reducing their sixty-four waist.
To a half of that figure, or so.
And losing their weight with precision and haste.
Is really "quite easy, you know."
More books have been written about this one thing,
Than most any subject you'd name,
Anyone who is "heavy" vHU try it a fling.
As if they were playing a game.
The papers are crowded with helps for the fat.
And just how to eat and get thin,
But what in the deuce is the good of all that.
To a fellow as than as a pin?

....Popular Superstitions: That you can talk a professor
out of a condition.

Did you ever go to a banquet where the chairs are
crowded close together? And did you ever sit down
and begin eating? And then you found that the guy
on your right is LEFT-HANDER.

WAR—Is hereby declared on the laundry that starches
our handkerchiefs.

Our National Grubstake
Oh, every land it has its cooks, of dishes quite a number,
But there's one dish in every land, for satisfying hunger.
The Chinese have Chop Suey, its Tortilla, though, in
Spain.
It's Goulash for the Servians, and deadens hunger's
pain.
The Germans call it Suppe, and the Irish, Mulligan,
And Stew is chefly eaten by the bally Englishman.
But here in our America, from Maine to Calabash,
We call our week-end dishes simply by the name of
Hash.

He: (next day)— Yes, I had a wonderful time, too,
only my leg went to sleep
She —The idea! We only sat out one dance.
