Editor of the D. P. A.: â€”
For the benefit of future Stanford
debates and debaters, and with a genu
ine desire to preserve the Stanford
spirit of mutual accord and co-opera
tion, 1 beg to recommend that the odi
ous and somewhat personal raillery
printed in the last two editions of the
D. P. A. regarding the California De
bate, be immediately terminated, and
to offer the opinion that this wrang
ling is not representative of those
earnestly interested in debating at
1 Stanford. Incidentally I wish to dis-
I claim all connection with or knowl
edge of any of these articles, despite
the fact that the first bore the signa
ture of the debating team.
This suggestion is made in all sin
cerity and earnestness, by
KNOX MILLER.
