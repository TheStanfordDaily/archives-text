Dr. Valera Attacks Treaty.
The prospects for complete peace in
Ireland were somewhat dimmed today
when DeValera ) announced jthat he
could not support the treaty, and that
two members of the Cabinet agreed
with him. The five members of the
Cabinet who signed the treaty will
continue to support it. The responsi
bility for accepting or refusing it will
rest with the Dail Eeireann, which
will meet next Wednesday.
It is expected that the Irish Free
State will assume liability for the
$6,000,000 loan raised in America by
the Irish Republic through the sale
of certificates. These not3s will prob
ably funded into 5% bonds.
Irish Success Expected to
Affect India.
Ireland's success in securing recog
nition for her nationalistic aims will
doubtless have a great effect upon the
Indian political situation, where a far
more unwieldy and perhaps less in
tense nationalist movement is in pro
gress. The British seems to have add
ed another blunder to their record in
India. Nearly a hundred Moplah rebel
prisoners were placed in a freight car
without sufficient ventilation, so that
all but six died.
This incident, following upon the
massacre of natives by the British
military at Amritsar in 1919, will make
conciliation in India more difficult. Dr.
Ghandi, the semi-religious leader of
the nationalists and prophet of pas
sive resistance to the British will soon
have an opportunity to test his great
strength, for the Prince of Wales, at
a rather ill-chosen moment, is on his
way to India ,and his official visit will
give the non-co-operators" a chance
to make themselves conspicuous.
Root Resolution to Help China.
The Chinese have scored another
small point at Washington. At the
opening of the. conference the Root reso
lution was adopted by which the pow
ers agreed to help China build a stable
government.
Now a resolution offered by the Brit
ish delegate has been adopted by the
Committee on Far Eastern Affairs, ac
cording to which the powers agree not to
be enticed into any treaty which would
impair the purpose of the Root resolu
tion. Hughes has announced, further
more, that no secret treaties shall be
e.ntered into as regards China. But this
still leaves China's main demand unsat
isfied, for China insists that no treaties
shall be made regarding her without con
sulting her government.
Japan Demands a Stable China.
A semi-official report from Tokio sug
gests that Japan will not accept the
"Four Power Entente" as a substitute
for the alliance with England until it is
clear that the conference will stabilize
conditions in China. At the insistence
of Japan, China has been bound not to
get herself into fresh trouble by giving
away her rights.
