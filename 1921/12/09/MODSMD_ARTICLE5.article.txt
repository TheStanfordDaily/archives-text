# TEMPLETON UNCOVERS GOOD TRACK MATERIAL
## 
### 
In accordance with the belief of Coach
"Dink" Templeton that fall track is the
foundation for competition in the spring,
a large squad of varsity and freshman
candidates are training on the track oval
every night.
Templeton says: "Fall training is an
invaluable foundation for work in the
spring. A good workout, not too strenu
ous, will start to build now the endur
ance needed later in the year. When
spring practice arrives, the track man
can do more, and will like his work
better."
Sudden, Coinstock, Clark. Carrey, and
Falk have been burning up the cinder
path in the sprint events. Eddie Sud
den, last year's freshman captain, es
tablished new records in the Stanford-
California meet by winning the 100-yard
dash in ten flat and the 220-yard event
in 22 seconds. Comstock finished third
in the century last year, with Kirksey
and Hutchinson leading. Thurman Clark
is another 100-yard runner who hovers
around the 10:1 mark. Lane balk won
his letter last year against California by
following a close second to Williams of
Stanford, in the low hurdles.
It is not certain whether or not Kirk
sey will return for spring track. How
ever, Captain Kenneth Wright is ex
pected to be on hand to run the quar
ter-mile, in which he staged a big sur
prise last season by reaching the tape a
scant two feet behind "Oxy' Hendrix
son. Roy Williamson and Bob Wright
are preparing for the 440. 880, and relay.
Tauzer and Sampson, who placed sec
ond and third in the discus with "Brick'
Muller first, have been tossing the plat
ter regularly. Mint Howell has re
turned and has cleared the high-jump
bar at six feet three inches. Harlan
Dykes, '18, has been going about an
inch lower than Howell. Robinson, 24,
also looks good in this event.
Although Glen Hartranft, '24, has
been out for football until lately, he
heaved the shot nearly forty-three feet
in intramural track. Hanner, of Olym
pic games fame, hurls the javelin occa
sionally. Bill Black, who sprang a sur
prise last year by tying Norris of Cali
fornia for first place in the pole-vault,
has been limbering up recently.
Everett Home, winner of the half
i mile in the 1918 Cardinal-Blue and Gold
meet, has been getting an early start
after another victory. Eddleman and
Ronsselott have been training hard for
the distance events. Many others are
working in the various divisions of the
track art.

"Dink" Templeton that fall track is the
foundation for competition in the spring,
a large squad of varsity and freshman
candidates are training on the track oval
every night.
Templeton says: "Fall training is an
invaluable foundation for work in the
spring. A good workout, not too strenu
ous, will start to build now the endur
ance needed later in the year. When
spring practice arrives, the track man
can do more, and will like his work
better."
Sudden, Coinstock, Clark. Carrey, and
Falk have been burning up the cinder
path in the sprint events. Eddie Sud
den, last year's freshman captain, es
tablished new records in the Stanford-
California meet by winning the 100-yard
dash in ten flat and the 220-yard event
in 22 seconds. Comstock finished third
in the century last year, with Kirksey
and Hutchinson leading. Thurman Clark
is another 100-yard runner who hovers
around the 10:1 mark. Lane balk won
his letter last year against California by
following a close second to Williams of
Stanford, in the low hurdles.
It is not certain whether or not Kirk
sey will return for spring track. How
ever, Captain Kenneth Wright is ex
pected to be on hand to run the quar
ter-mile, in which he staged a big sur
prise last season by reaching the tape a
scant two feet behind "Oxy' Hendrix
son. Roy Williamson and Bob Wright
are preparing for the 440. 880, and relay.
Tauzer and Sampson, who placed sec
ond and third in the discus with "Brick'
Muller first, have been tossing the plat
ter regularly. Mint Howell has re
turned and has cleared the high-jump
bar at six feet three inches. Harlan
Dykes, '18, has been going about an
inch lower than Howell. Robinson, 24,
also looks good in this event.
Although Glen Hartranft, '24, has
been out for football until lately, he
heaved the shot nearly forty-three feet
in intramural track. Hanner, of Olym
pic games fame, hurls the javelin occa
sionally. Bill Black, who sprang a sur
prise last year by tying Norris of Cali
fornia for first place in the pole-vault,
has been limbering up recently.
Everett Home, winner of the half
i mile in the 1918 Cardinal-Blue and Gold
meet, has been getting an early start
after another victory. Eddleman and
Ronsselott have been training hard for
the distance events. Many others are
working in the various divisions of the
track art.
