# DREAM OF MARY ORATORIO GIVEN BY LARGE CAST
## S. F. Symphony Orchestra, Choir, Children's Chorus, and Cast Present Cantata 
### 
"1 lie Dream of Mary," Horatio Par
ker's inspiring cantata, was presented
last night in the Stanford Memorial
Church. One of the largest congrega
tions which has ever assembled in the
church witnessed this beautiful produc
tion, which tells the story of the life of
Christ from the cradle to the grave.
After the opening hymn, and a brief
prayer by Dr. Gardner, the Stanford
Glee Club sang "The First Nowell," a
traditional English folk-song. Then the
lights flashed up disclosing a rude
thatched stable in the center of the chan
cel. Mary, the mother of Jesus, was
seated by the side of the lowly manger.
Three shepherds were lying on the
ground to the left of the hut. The angel
of the Lord appeared and conversed with
the shepherds.
Then in rapid succession the main
events in the life of Christ were repre
sented. Three wise men came bearing
their gifts of incense and myrrh. The
next episode, the miracle of faith,
showed the healing of the blind, the
lame, the deaf, and the raising of the
dead. Three chief priests of the syna
gogue entered and covenanted with Ju
das for the betrayal of Christ. Pilate
cleansed himself of the blood of the in
nocent man. The rugged cross was
brought forth by Simon, the Cyrene.
Joseph of Arimathea appeared bearing
the grave clothes which Christ is des
tined to wear. In the next episode, the
angel informs the weeping women that
Jesus has risen and a flash of light
showed the empty tomb. In the last
episode, which is entitled "Christmas
Once More," the entire cast of thirty
persons gathered on the stage for the
final tableau. The living picture below
surmounted by the three wonderful pic
tures above representing the birth, the
crucifixion, and the resurrection of Jesus
Christ made an unforgettable image on
the minds of the spectators. Dr. Gard
ner pronounced the benediction and thus
closed a most impressive production
which certainly succeeded in its motive,
to provide the students with a serious
view of the spirit of the coming Christ
mas season.
The Stanford choir, under the direc
tion of Warren D. Allen and assisted
by the University Glee Club, sang sev
eral numbers during the intermissions
between the episodes. They were sup
ported by seventeen members of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, who
played the orchestral prelude. Mrs. Ruth
