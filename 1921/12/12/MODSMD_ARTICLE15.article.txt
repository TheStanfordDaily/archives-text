# Freshmen To Give Dance On Registration Night
## 
### 
The first freshman dance of the year
will be held in Enclna Gym. Tuesday
night, January 3. Whitmer's five
piece orchestra will furnish the music.
Tickets, $1.10, may be obtained on the
Quad, Registration Day, next quarter.
Tod Weil, chairman of the decoration
committee, announces that there will
be simple decorations so that, the
greater amount of the proceeds may
be returned to the class treasury.
The freshman class treasurer will
be at the Engineering Corner every
day this week, to receive clas√ü dues.
Many of the commuting first-year men
have failed to pay their dues.
