# IDAHO AND U.S.C. ARE ADMITTED TO P.C. CONFERENCE
## Tennis and Swimming New Conference Sports; Eligibility changes are Made 
### 
Director Powell, who returned last
night from the north, with Graduate
Manager Fletcher, Stanford's represen
tatives to the meeting of the Pacific
Coast Conference, states that there was
no opposition to the admission of U. S.
C. and University of Idaho to the P.
C. C.
Tennis and swimming were included
as Conference meets and these will be
held annually. Conference tennis will
be run on the same plan as that used by
the National Association, with cups and
trophies.
Two changes were made in the eligibil
ity rules. Hereafter all transfers will
be compelled to go a full calendar year
before they will be eligible for Confer
ence sports. A transfer coming to Stan
ford at Christmas time would not be
eligible for football the next year, even
though he went through the summer
quarter and completed the three quarters
required under the old ruling and would
have to wait until the second fall before
playing. This rule does not affect fresh
men, and the old rule of three com
pleted quarters still applies to freshman
eligibility.
The second eligibility ruling is that a
transfer coming from one university to
another becomes a bona-fide student
upon registering. He is a student of the
University as soon as his fees become
due and regardless of their payment or
non-payment.
A ruling was passed that the invitation
sent east for the New Year's game at
Pasadena must hereafter come only from
the Conference itself, and Pasadena
shall have nothing to do with it beyond
the renting of her field for the game.
In the future the meeting of the grad
uate managers will be held in the spring
and not in connection with Conference
meeting as it was this year.
