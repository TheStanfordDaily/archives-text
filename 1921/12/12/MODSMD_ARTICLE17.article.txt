# JACK FISHBURN, '24, SHOWS UP WELL IN INTERCLASS BOXING
## 
### 
Jack Fishburn and Lewis Penwcll
fought the best bout of the intercla?s
tournament at F.ncina gymnasium Fri
day afternoon. The men were evenly
matched and they showed a willingness
to mix which made the bout an excellent
one to watch. A furious exchange of
blows at close range featured the first
round, neither man having the advan
tage. Penwell pressed the fight in the
second round and got an edge on his op
ponent. In the third round the going
was fairly even with Penwell leading by
a shade. Coach Harry Mayoney, who
refereed the matches, was unable to de
cide the winner and the men fought an
other round. Again the battle was hotly
contested, Fishburn making a wonderful
come-back and earning a draw decision.
Adams and Murphy fought another
extra round bout which Murphy won
by piling up a lead in the fourth round.
Hard blows and fast footwork in th
first two rounds resulted in Adams pil
ing up a slight lead. In the third round,
Murphy evened matters up, and in the
fourth, his punches to the body were so
effective that he was given the decision.
Kenney Shipp won his match from
"Red" Bell without much trouble. Bell
put up an excellent fight in the first
round, but in the second and third,
Shipp's superior condition told on his
inexperienced opponent. Shipps wicked
right to the head and body was work
ing well during the entire bout. Me i>
a hard man to hit, and packs a lot of
punch in either mitt, which should make
him a hard man to beat in his class.
Some good matches are expected thi
afternoon when the scini-fmals end and
the finals'begin. Fishburn, Shipp, Pen
well, and Murphy look to be the most
likely contenders for the championship
of the campus, and when these men get
together a great deal of action should re
sult.
