# Alumni Support.

Stanford ilumni are backing the University in its
campaign to raise funds to aid in the necessary
growth of this institution. The willingness and en
thusiasm of the alumni is contained in the resolutions
drawn up and unanimously adopted by the represen
tative group of more than fifty alumni who gathered
here last Friday and Saturday for a conference with
the Trustees, President Wilbur, and Comptroller
Roth.
These fifty and more representatives of the older
brothers and sisters of the University came from all
points of the country to be informed as to the exact
financial condition of Stanford University and its
plans for the future. They were shown about the
campus and through the Medical School in San
Francisco. Conditions were explained to them that
hitherto have been obscured by the aura of "the rich
est endowed institution of learning in the country."
It was pointed out to them that Stanford now uses
all of its income in maintaining itself under the
present requirements. Stanford needs were pointed
out and they fall under three heads. First, there is
an immediate need for more money for professors'
salaries. Secondly, more living quarters and eating
accommodations are a necessity on the Stanford
campus. Thirdly, additional hospital buildings must
be constructed in San Francisco to keep up with
public demands on the Medical School there.
Coming in their order, the first effort will be to
raise $700,000 to complete the fund for one million
dollars for the increase of professors' salaries in the
letters and sciences departments. The General Edu
cation Board will contribute the other $300,000 when
the $700,000 has been assured. Following this the
money will be raised for the construction of new
buildings.
All universities depend upon public donations for
the construction of new buildings. To date Stan
ford has received, aside from the Medical School
plant, but one gift of this kind from any but the
family of the founders â€”that of the anonymous
donor for the construction of the new Stanford
Union, which is now nearly completed. The loss of
more than a million and a quarter dollars' worth of
buildings in the earthquake of 1906 has set the
building schedule of the University back more than
fourteen years. It is just now on an even basis with
construction in 1906.
Consideration of the above facts shows that Stan
ford University has come to a point in its affairs
where it must either lower its standards or increase
its resources. The latter course is the only one that
can be adopted, and it is in support of a plan to raise
the necessary funds that the alumni have pledged
themselves through their representatives.
The alumni have recognized the immediate need.
They have pledged themselves to see that the neces
sary funds are provided.
Stanford University, through their efforts, will
contine to advance as all institutions must if they
arc to continue to fulfill the purposes for which they
are founded.
