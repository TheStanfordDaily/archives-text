Do you realize: —
That Christmas is not so very far away?
That the annual output of wampus-cat wool in
Australia is greater than the number of Mead
cafeterias in San Francisco?
That the total number of finals this quarter, if placed
end to end, would reach from bad to worse?
That Christmas is closer than when you read the
first question.
* *
That being the case, as the prohibition sleuth re
marked, we should take time by the timeclock and get
in training for our Christmas dinner. As for any ath
letic event, the guy that sees a good turkey dinner in
the offing, should be prepared.

Cabbages, Monday section, offers below a few rules for
food-enthusiasts to observe between now and the morn
ing of the 25th. Follow these carefully and you'll be
able to overeat even little Willie, the 14-year old phenoin,
who shattered all existing records last Christmas.
♦ * *
1. Lay off all turkey, mince pie and hard sauce. Don't
even dream about it.
2. For breakfast, eat salt horse with a few fried
shoestrings. For lunch, the same, with a little Sears
ville added. For dinner, have thoughts of breakfast.
3. Get up before breakfast every morning, and never
go to bed until you have finished your dinner.
4. Take plenty of exercise by chewing your food
slowly.
5. The day before Christmas, pretend you're a hundred
dollar bill and chase yourself all over town. Go to bed
early and dream of the Dinner Party.

This is the last chance we have this quarteer to speak
through this Monday column and assorted Durham, so
we hate to waste space by printing the atrocity below.
But we've rated a razz, and can't help being proud of it:
* * *
Our query dep't rec'd the following epistle yesterday:
"Dear Kabs: If I should suddenly find myself on the
ground floor of a coffee factory, in a locked room, and
there were both a wild bull and a wild cat in the same
room, what should I do?" —Signed, Double Cross.
Our reply: "Dear Sir: —Make a noise like smallpox
and break out."
* * *
We have secured, at enormous expense, the South
San Francisco Sympathy Orchestra •to give a series of
noises next Monday night, to refresh the boys in the
midst of finals.
* * *
The leader, Alfred Wurst, is one of the famous Wurst
musicians of the country. He received his early educa
tion beating time to the lockstep march.
* * *
The first number will be the "Epiglottis Casaba," from
Meddlesome's "Overtime."
The second number will be drawn in the lottery.
The third number will be 130013. The motif will
be laid on the mantlepiece, over the ash-tray. The at
mosphere will be stifling.
• • •
A score-board on the center of the stage will record
the yardage and at the same time give you the proper
numbers. The hat will be passed between halves for the
quarters.
* • *
Anyone wishing to leave before the concert is finished
must make a public apology first. The doors will be
closed after the concert is over.
• * *
Intercollegiate shooting matches will start soon. The
job of field umpire is still open.
* * *
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
Dear Sir: —I can not see why all the argument about
the debating story in your paper has been allowed to
go on. I was present at the debate, and can say truth
fully that I never saw one like it. I am a little deaf,
so am absolutely unprejudiced. If one of the members
of the team thinks he was done an injustice, he should
turn the other cheek and do likewise. As for looking
at the Cotillion list, every body did that. It was too
dark to see at the same time who was at the dance.
As for being absent from the debate, the writer of
the story has a perfect right to be. My grandfather
never even saw Egypt in the atlas, but he wrote one
of the most vivid accounts of Mark Anthony's week-end
visit that was ever refused publication. It is discourag
ing and annoying to see such oblosity.
(Signed) TAINT WRIGHT.

And here we have another puzzled soul:
* * *
Dear Monday:—The following questions are puzzling
to a new student at Stanford. I wonder if they can
be answered in your Monday column—the half-sister
of corned beef.
(1) —When they serve the food at the Cotillion should
you line-up with the others and begin calling signals
to rush the source of food?
(2) —Should the lady take the gentleman's arm, or his
watch ?
(3) —If the "hello" fails, can bricks be used?
— (Also Signed)—JOE.

So that Tuesday won't get a chance to fill up space,
we'll answer these queries right here.
* * *
(1) —Use the Statue of Liberty Pose. (2) —Yes. (3)
—If you haven't been introduced to her, yes.
+ * »
Farewell till next year. And don't let Tuesday or
Wednesday put anything over on you. (Watch their
snappy come-backs on this one).
