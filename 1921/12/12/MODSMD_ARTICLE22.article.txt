A City of Caprice. By Ncnll Compton
Wilson. San Francisco. The Metro
politan Press. 1921.
This book of poems is all about San
Francisco. It would be difficult to find
a more intrinsically romantic and poeti
cal milieu. The beauty of the city by
the Golden Gate is not so much of the
set-piece kind as of the transient and
ritful; for the traveler shall look there
in vain for boulevards and fountains and
palaces and cathedrals to rival those of
Paris, or Venice, or Rome. And, as
may be in these lines with which
the book opens, our author, who, by the
way, is a Stanford student of the class
of 1912, is well aware of this fact.
Can, within a mirror, live
Scenes already fugitive?
Can, in oils and canvas, thus
Cling a sunset luminous?
Or, though sweet the corsage, yet
Flourish, plucked, a violet?
Then, oh city of caprice,
Shall / capture you with these!
Many cities have their special qualities
of light and form and color; and among
these, because of its blue skies, the bur
nished floor of its bay. its drifting mists,
its enveloping fogs, the flowers at its
street-corners, its cosmopolitan popula
tion, and many another characterizing
feature, none other has a more secure
place than San Francisco. Where else,
for instance, shall one look for so pic
turesque a mingling of orient and Occi
dent, of men from ice-bound shores of
the north and others from islands of the
sleeping southern seas, as one can find,
on almost every hand, in this "outpost
of Cathay"?
The evanescent and the unprehensible
are the chief elements in the alluring
charm of San Francisco. Who has not
noticed the conflict of its lamps with the
deepening blue of the sky that makes its
twilight hour, in street and square, more
beautiful than dreams?
From eight to.twelves so swiftly fade
The hues along this promenade.
And over and over again these things
are not only hinted in thisMiook before
us, but, as far as may be, described.
One more truth, too, has our poet
learned and loved about San Francisco.
He knows that the city is what she,is
because in the past she was all that her
lovers have told us she was. Of this
romantic character of her past let the
poem entitled Mardi Gras, of which we
have space for only a single stanza,
speak.
Senorita, breathless flirt,
Close your fan and gather skirt.
Hither strides a miner
By Itis boots and colored shirt
dearly Forty-niner.
Come! from pages of romance
Step, and show how Spain could dance.
Yes! The city is self-haunted.
street, and hill, and wharf, and square
are wafted vague whispers of a town
that has now largely fled into the irre
vocable past.
You shall find the authentic spirit of
the place in A City of Caprice; and there,
too, shall you come upon the spirit of
poetry. For those who love the city we
know of no other book, in prose or verse,
that could be more welcome. It is im
pregnated with what, perhaps, we may
venture to call Sattfranciscanismus. And
every reader of it will hope that the
author, whatever may be the round of
his daily occupation, will long continue
to find in his heart the imperative neces
sity of singing.

the Golden Gate is not so much of the
set-piece kind as of the transient and

palaces and cathedrals to rival those of
Paris, or Venice, or Rome. And, as
may be in these lines with which
the book opens, our author, who, by the
way, is a Stanford student of the class
of 1912, is well aware of this fact.

Scenes already fugitive?
Can, in oils and canvas, thus
Cling a sunset luminous?

Flourish, plucked, a violet?

Shall / capture you with these!
Many cities have their special qualities
of light and form and color; and among
these, because of its blue skies, the bur

tion, and many another characterizing
feature, none other has a more secure
place than San Francisco. Where else,
for instance, shall one look for so pic
