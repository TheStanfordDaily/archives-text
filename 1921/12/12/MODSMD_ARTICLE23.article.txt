Dear Editor:
Not long ago the vacillating inaction
of the inter-fraternity conference was
condemned in the columns of the. Daily
Palo Alto. The criticism brought to
mind the primary function of that body
regulation of rushing activities. Rush
ing activities: a freshman, a "Big Game"
of competitive squabble enveloped in a
smoke-screen of bunk, an armistice, a
tired and trembling frosh. a lawyer—
then joys and sorrows, triumphs and
despairs, charges and counter-charges.
That is rushing.
Permit a proposal of construction:
"That no freshman shall be rushed or
pledged by any fraternity until he is in
his SECOND quarter of University
work." In which event would not the
fraternities rush themselves in order to
impress their prospective rushees with
the tremendous force of their concerted
ability? Would not the frosh get on the
boat and demonstrate that he is an ac
tive Stanford man as well as a high
school hero? For it would be very evi
dent. even fo a frosh. that the boys on
the row would rather have a mc.mber of
the freshman team than the best snake
from "X. 11. S."
The argument that this scheme would
not work because such an extended pe
riod of non-rushing would invite viola
tion of the rules by the house is met
with the observation that "It couldn't
be much worse than it is!"
Is the inter-fraternity conference
open-minded to ne.w ideas?
