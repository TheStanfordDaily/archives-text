WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
The Washington Conference seems
to be drawing to a successful conclu
sion. Opposition to the 5-5-3 naval
ratio and the ten years naval holiday
has disappeared. A four-power treaty
embodying the understanding between
the United States, Great Britain, Japan
and France will be submitted to the
Senate very soon, and there is a gen
eral expectation on the part of Demo
crats and Republicans alike that it
will be ratified with little opposition.
The latest work of the Conference is
the drafting of a nine-power under
standing by which China will be given
the opportunity to re-establish herself
as a full-fledged member of the
family of nations.
IRELAND
The proposed Irish settlement
awaits the action of the Dail Eirann on
Wednesday. Just now, rumor is busy
with the comparative strength of the
DeValera and the Arthur Grif
fith group, and the possibilty that the
Irish Labor Party may decide the
balance between them.
EUROPEAN SITUATION
Secretary Hoover has just issued a
very encouraging statement on Eu
ropean conditions. He declares that
since the Armistice, the combatant
states with the exception of Russia
show steady gains in social, economic
and political stability. The dangers
of Bolshevism have disappeared and
even in Russia extreme communism
is slowly boiling to death in the cal
dron of starvation.
The German situation is the most
critical. The outcome of it depends
upon the method and volume of the
reparation payments. Until this is
settled upon a sound economic basis
by Europe, American cannot enter in
to constructive consideration of the
situation in other states.
In the field of international rela
tions, war has ceased except in Tur
key to treaties of peace are effect
ive throughout the world. The econ
omic pressure of taxes and unbalanced
budgets, is slowly disarming Europe,
and will continue to do so to an even
greater extent.
