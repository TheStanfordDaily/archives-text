"There has been no definite schedule
drawn up for track as yet," said Coach
"Dink" Templeton, in regard to the va

issued. "Nothing has been decided upon,
and no announcement can be made until
after the Coast Conference meeting in
Portland."
Only two tentative dates are so far
known to Stanford authorities. The
meet with California will probably be
held either on April 14 or 22, while the
Pacific Coast Conference is expected to
be May 6 or 13.
