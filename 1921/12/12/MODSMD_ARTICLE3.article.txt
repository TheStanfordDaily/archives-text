# Scholarship Handicaps Will Be Considered by Committee On Standing
## 
### 
Students who have been ill during the
present quarter or who have otherwise
been interrupted in their work and who
fear that their marks will be such as to
cause some scholarship action, may re
port the special circumstances to Miss
McKendry, the secretary of the Commit
tee on Scholarship this week between
1:30 and 4:30. Miss McKendry may be
found in room 1 of the Law Building.
The committee will meet on Saturday,
December 17, and all excuses must be in
by Friday afternoon at 4:30 for them to
be considered.
