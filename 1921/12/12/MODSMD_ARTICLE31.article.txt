### 
The Southern Pacific Company has an
nounced that a reduction of one-fourth
will be made, beginning December 22, on
round-trip tickets having a one-way fare
of $25 or less. Thus students who are
planning to travel any great distance for
the holidays can make a saving of one
fourth on their total transportation costs
by waiting one day after the finals.
This reduction can only be secured by
purchasing the ticket at the starting
point of the transportation for which it
is to be used.
