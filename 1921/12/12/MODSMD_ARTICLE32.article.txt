# Personal Numbers Will Be Rung Up in January Edition of Chaparral
## 
### 
You'd never believe it. The most
scandalous thing! I promised not to
mention a word, so don't te.ll a soul I
told you. Last night—
And then the conversation got per
sonal. Really, it was just too thrill
ing. How he ever found the right
number —
The "Personal Number" of Chapar
ral, to be issued in January, will be
the right number to confide all con
fidential thrillers to. Country corre
spondent columns, 'sketches of freak
characters, as well as eveything of a
personal nature which can be aired
in public (B. V. D. jokes barred) is
acceptable for the coming issue.
Contributions will be received by
Editor Tom Carskadon until 6 o'clock,
December 21. Nothing, however, can
be accepted about actual people; gen
eral types only are to be set up for
satire by campus scribes.
