# ALUMNI WILL HACK EFFORT TO INCREASE PRESENT ENDOWMENT
## Fifty Representatives Meet on Campus To Confer with University Officials And Pledge Fund Campaign Support 
### 
Stanford's alumni will back the Uni
versity in its efforts to obtain additional
endowment needed to maintain its pres
ent standards. The fifty representative
alumni called to the campus to confer
on the University's situation and needs,
have pledged themselves to support a
campaign for funds and have, returned
to their homes prepared to enlist all
other alumni in the campaign.
These alumni, invited to the campus
from all over the United States, after
inspecting the plants on the Palo Alto
campus and of the Medical School in
San Francisco, and having the whole
financial situation of the University pre
sented to them in detail, closed their
sessions by drawing up and unanimously
passing a set of resolutions pledging
their enthusiastic and united efforts in
the following words :
"Whereas, Stanford University has
reached the point in its affairs where it
is necessary to lower the standards or
increase its resources; and
"Whereas this condition has been
clearly demonstrated to us after a care
ful examination of the University and
its financial affairs;
"Now Therefore Be It Resolved, That
the representation of the alumni organi
zations throughout the country here as
sembled unanimously endorsed the plan
outlined by the Trustees and University
authorities to secure the required re
sources, and pledge our enthusiastic sup
port of the same."
The alumni whom the University in
vite to the conference are the men and
women elected by alumni organizations
in all parts of the country as their rep

resentatives, as presidents of local Stan
ford clubs, secretaries of permanent
class organizations and members of the
Alumni Executive Committee and of the
Alumni Advisory Board. To this group,
numbering more than fifty, the Trustees,
President Wilbur, and Comptroller A.
E. Roth gave in detail the whole situa
tion in which Stanford now finds itself,
as well as their plans for the future.
Stanford now uses every cent of its
income in maintaining itself with pres
ent requirements, and faccs the, imme
diate need of more money for profes
sors salaries and for more buildings for
living quarters and eating facilities on
the campus and for additional hospital
buildings in San hrancisco to keep up
with the public demands in connection
with the Medical School there.
The first effort will be to raise $700,-
000 which Stanford has undertaken to
secure in accordance with the offe.r, the
General Education Board to contribute
$300,000 of a million-dollar endowment
for the increase of the salaries of pro
fessors in the letters and sciences de
partments. Next will come the raising
of the money needed for buildings.
The plan for securing these funds, as
proposed by the Trustees and President
\\ ilbur, is that the whole body of for
mer students at Stanford shall definitely
assume the responsibility for raising the
money, not only through their own con
tributions but by enlisting the support of
all friends of the University in all parts
of the country. By organizing such a
widespread and well-informed body it is
felt that the money needed can be gained
in a comparatively short time through
a quiet and intensified campaign.
The alumni who participated in the
two-day conference are convinced that
the funds the University needs can be
raised in this way and have returned to
their own districts prepared to get a
campaign under way as soon as details
of the organization of the work are com
pleted.
