# TUSSING AND DE BACK DEFEAT LEEDS, LOGAN
## 
### 
Ford Tussing and Norman Deßack
defeated Barclay Leeds and William Lo
gan, 6-3, 6-2, Saturday morning in the
open doubles tennis tournament.
The match was much closer than the
straight set scores indicate. Leeds and
Logan used teamwork effectively. The
consistent driving of the former and
the net playing of Logan forced Tussing
and Deßack to do their best. Many
seemingly impossible gets were made by
both doubles teams.
