# NEW CONSTITUTION IS ADOPTED BY MAJORITY OF CAMPUS FRATERNITIES
## Five Members Temporarily Refuse Ratification of Agreement 
### 
Eighteen fraternities represented in
the Interfraternity Conference last
night ratified the new constitution
which will govern the actions ot' the
fraternities in matters ot' rushing and
general conduct during the ensuing
quarters. Five fraternities refused
temporarily to ratify the new consti
tution because of certain disputes
which arose over passages in the con
stitution. The constitution as it stands
has the sanction of President Wilbur.
The five dissenting members. Al
pha Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, and Phi
Kappa Psi, withheld their approval of
the constitution because disputed sec
tions of the old constitution had not
been strengthened and changed in the
new body of rules. The main objec
tions to the new constitution are in the
matter of the length of the rushing
season, and the subject of penalties
for violations of the rules.
The status of the new members of
the conference who failed to ratify
the new constitution is undecided at
present. Their case rests largely with
the settlement of the disputes that
have arisen over the passages in the
new constitution.
"There shall be a period of formal
rushing which shall extend until 12
o'clock midnight of the thirteenth day
after registration day. Formal rush
ing shall be considered to mean that
there shall be no talking on fraternity
matters."
"No fraternity shall be allowed
more than one date in advance. No
date with one fraternity shall be con
secutive. No fraternity shall have
more than one date per day. No fresh

! man shall be allowed to spend the
night at any fraternity house during
I formal rushing periods."
"Each freshman shall be provided
with an official date card which shall
be open to inspection by any frater
nity at any time. Interfraternity rules
will be printed on the back of each
I card. A freshman violating these rules
shall be subject to action by the In
terfraternity Conference." It is em
' phasized that freshmen must live up
| to these rules, under the penalty of
being prevented from pledging. The
| card system is instituted to do away
j with undue deference by fraternities
j to freshmen.
An amendment to the new constitu
| tion was made last night which pro
| vides that a pledge must have a C av
j erage before he may be initiated. Pres
j ident Wilbur regards this rule as put
ting fraternities on a higher plane and
giving them a better chance to main
! tain the necessary scholarship stand
ards.
Conference rules concerning the
manner of pledging, the restriction of
I rushing, and the breaking of pledges
are substantially the same as before.
Heaton Wrenn, '21, Phi Delta Theta,
was elected president of the confer
ence for the next two quarters. F. S.
Turner, '21, Zeta Psi, will be the next
secretary and treasurer. Hereafter
the terms of office for these two offices
will be one year.
President Wrenn intends to thor
oughly acquaint the new men with
rushing rules, particularly by means
of freshman assemblies and the fresh
man bible, in order that fewer misun
derstandings will result.
