some for boys and some, for girls, some
heavy and some light, have been dist
ributed among the women of the cam

25 ccntÂ« a pair, as the. Women's Ser
vice Board has bought them at whole
sale price and is covering over half the
cost itseelf. In filling the stockings, the

the other, and to fill only one. so that
there will be no danger of pairs being
separated. Toys, nuts, raisins, and
candy are suggested as gifts.
All stockings must be turned in to the
