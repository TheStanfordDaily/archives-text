# CARD 1922 GRID SCHEDULE GIVEN OUT BY P. C. C.
## All Games With Exception of Contest With the Aggies to Be Played in new Stadium 
### 
With one exception, all of Stanford's
football games of the 1922 conference
season, including that with the Uni
versity of California, will be played
in the Stanford stadium.
That announcement was made pub
lic following a meeting of ihe coaches
and graduate managers of the Pacific
Coast Conference, which just finished
its session at Portland.
According to the schedules arranged
at the northern conclave, the Stanford
varsity will meet every opponent on
the Cardinal campus with the excep
tion of the game with the Oregon Ag
gies, which will be played at Corvallis
on October 28.
The annual big game witli Califor
nia will be played here on November
25. It is practically certain that the
stadium at Berkeley will not be com
pleted in time to hold the game there
next year where it would have been
played under the old rotation system.
It is believed that the schedule ar
ranged for the Stanford team next sea
son is the hardest that a Cardinal or
ganization has ever had.
The University of Southern Califor
nia will send a team here for the first
time since Stanford resumed American
football. The University of Washing
ton, Oregon Aggies, Santa Clara, Ne
vada, and St. Mary's are on the list of
games.
The schedule for the season follows:

Mary's at Stanford; October 28, Ore
gon Agricultural College at Corvallis;
