# Tempering Ambition
## 
### 
Division of a student body into two groups—par
ticipants and non-participants in student activity—•
may he regarded by the casual observer as a com
plete classification. But to members of the groups,
l>oth the active and the inactive in student affairs,
there appears a need for a re-division of the former.
There exists in every body of humans, regardless
ol nature and purpose, those individuals who hold
personal aggrandizement above all else, even though
the betterment of the entire organization depends
upon a spirit of sacrifice and cooperation. To the
determined gratification of personal ambitions and
the satisfaction of selfish ends the unworthy aspirant
to envied heights of achievement may attribute his
eventual downfall.
Human life, society, all that is worth while, re
volves about the orbit of friendly cooperation. Po
litical, social, or economic rise by one member of an
organization means that someone else has been de
prived of the momentary opportunity. W here all
members are working toward a common end, namely,
the betterment of that organization and all other
organizations as a group, the manifestation of per
sonal desires can only spell one thing—the elimina
tion of the discordant cog in the machine. If such
a spirit does not exist within an organization, the
natural conclusion to be drawn is that the majority
membership of that group comprises a number of in
dividuals who are far more egotistical than altruistic.
The puny struggle for achievement on a personal
basis in college life is a practice, not only to be
frowned upon, but to be utterly wiped out by con
certed action of cooperating groups. The individ
ual who has built around himself a semblance of a
political machine designed to reach his own ends,
including what he may consider a means of avenging
himself upon others for supposed personal wrongs,
has failed to grasp the fundamental principles and
purposes of organized society. To an outsider, such
attempts, successful or not, are considered petty and
laughable; to every college student, regardless of
classification, they are unsafe and unworthy.
The task of every interested student is to strive
for unification of student organizations to achieve
ends of equal importance to all concerned. Temper
ing personal ambition is the first important step
toward reaching the goal for which we all presum
ably strive—a bigger, better Stanford.
