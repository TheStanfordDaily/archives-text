# The 						Diving Tower.

### 
'Vitli very little of the preliminary talk usually
•»anying such projects, a high-diving tower has
•inncd, and construction started, in Lake
The fifteen-foot depth of water to sur
')ase when the lake is full, together with
plan of the structure, will make it one of
/ers in the world.
e none in the United States better quali
,e charge of the work than those who are
-le for this latest edition to Stanford's ath
pment. Ernst Brandsten is not only recog
as a leading authority in everything pertaining
aquatic sports, hut he has also won international
nors in past Olympic games. Clarence Pinkston
, champion fancy high diver of the world.
I,t is distinctly Stanford enterprise that has made
il possible for the work to begin. Lack of adequate
finances seemed to form an insurmountable obstacle.
A large part of the problem, however, has been
solved by using the lumber from the old football
bleachers.
There remains still the question of labor. No
funds arc available with which to pay for the neces

sarv work on the tower. Jt is obviously impossible
for the few connected with instruction in swimming
to swing the job alone. The solution lies in volun
teer student help.
The call for volunteer help comes at a time when
every student is preparing for final examinations.
Very little else counts now. Yet too much concen
tration on studies is likely to do more harm than
good. Two hours' work in the open will break
the monotony of the day and freshen the mind.
Those who remain on the campus during the holidays
will find a use for the time which drags heavily upon
their hands.
It is to be remembered that the Stanford Stadium
was completed at so low a cost only through the co
operation of the students, the alumni, and other con
nected with the University. To put the present
project through, the students must show that same
spirit of cooperation. Those who do, will feel satis
fied in the thought that they have again done their
share to help make Stanford's athletic equipment the
best in the West.
