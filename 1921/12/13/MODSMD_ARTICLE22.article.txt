ANNA CONDA.
A Musical Show.
Manuscript by B. Lee Ache.
Score by A. Natural Sharpe.
Overture (Don't T're Tho You Lose the Pitch).
Scene I—Anna Conda, a live-wire, grounds herself
from the 10:30-10:50 at Roble Car-stop. Sees Akbar
driving his dogs toward somewhere else.
Anna: Where y' going?
Akbar: Cactus gardens.
Anna: Don't step on any spines.
Akbar: Where is it thrown after you get it out?
lately.
Anna: No. I have to get out the Roble Union's eor
respondence.
Abkar: Where is it thrown after you get it out?
Anna: Why, you—
Akbar: Stop! Remember, xhis is a conservative paper
Anna: I've half a mind to leave you after that.
Akbar: Well, there's George. He just got back from
a job in Colorado. He won't run.
Anna: Pretty lucky to get a job so soon out of college.
Akbar: Yes, he's been up there working over S.OOO
feet.
Anna: That's pretty heavy business for one bootblack,
isn't it?
Akbar: Ow! You'd better stay here where allowances
are made.
Anna: Darn right. I'm always after allowances. But
let's do those letters, it's as cold here as a banquet steak.
—Exeunt Omiies.
Last scene (register kicks with the chorus).
(Akbar trying to play ems from "Oliver" 011 Corona.
Motto 011 wall: "If you want to know what he was doing
the night before look at*his shoes, not in his eyes.")
Anna: Here's the form loiter.
Akbar: Never mind the form, I'll put it in shape.
Anna: I'll tell you how to change the names for the
rest.
S. N. Ache,
Zeke H?mse.
Dear Mr. Ache:
After th executive meeting of the Roble Coop
I am forced to ask you to excuse me from that date
I made with you for Wednesday. On the basis of
your last three dates with Carrie Herout you are
•onsidered "engaged." As a member of the Coop I
must inform you that the season is closed.
Sal. Ammoniac.
Akbar (hides his pin): Isn't that fine? Where am I
classed?
Anna: A snake is the lowest form we bother with.
Akbar: I bow. Let me sing.
Oh, the bards still scream
Of the Roble Queen
Of many years ago,
Who picked her band
Of snakes by hand,
Though she wore her dresses low.
Her ruby lips were natural,
And no powder touched her face;
And her legs were made for walking
When low heels were no disgrace.
Her eyebrows were uncultured
But her brain still functions well,
All hail the good old queen of Roble!
Anna: .What's that?
Akbar. That's Palo Alto, the Lonesome Pine.
Anna: Sounds like a debater.
Akbar: Another viewpoint?
Anna: Said "Debater" indignant and miffy,
There's a nasty, mean man on the "Dippy,"
'Tho my voice does seem high,
I'm a pretty nice guy
And I think he's decidedly lippy."
Akbar: The tune is good but you remind me of Thurs
day's section boss.
Pino gang!
From the uproar of kissing of late,
Wc see what a drop one can take.
Women cnce thought no treat
To have MEN at their feet,
Now Trimb's drool is the best they can rate.
(Defenestretion of Akbar.)
—Exeunt Omnes.
Roble: — Heavens! I've lost my bar pin!
Redwood: —Never mind, I know a place where you
can get it without one.

"Lost —in Cal rooting section —a steamer rug." E. I'.
wants to know if that person who lost that steamer rug
was on the boat.
Free dedication dance in pavilion now announced for
Friday the 13th. Knew there was a catch in it some
where.

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

Anna: No. I have to get out the Roble Union's eor
respondence.
Abkar: Where is it thrown after you get it out?
Anna: Why, you—
Akbar: Stop! Remember, xhis is a conservative paper
Anna: I've half a mind to leave you after that.
Akbar: Well, there's George. He just got back from
a job in Colorado. He won't run.
Anna: Pretty lucky to get a job so soon out of college.
Akbar: Yes, he's been up there working over S.OOO
feet.
Anna: That's pretty heavy business for one bootblack,
isn't it?
Akbar: Ow! You'd better stay here where allowances
are made.
Anna: Darn right. I'm always after allowances. But
let's do those letters, it's as cold here as a banquet steak.

Anna: I'll tell you how to change the names for the

Dear Mr. Ache:
After th executive meeting of the Roble Coop
I am forced to ask you to excuse me from that date
I made with you for Wednesday. On the basis of
your last three dates with Carrie Herout you are
•onsidered "engaged." As a member of the Coop I
must inform you that the season is closed.
Sal. Ammoniac.
Akbar (hides his pin): Isn't that fine? Where am I
classed?
Anna: A snake is the lowest form we bother with.
Akbar: I bow. Let me sing.
Oh, the bards still scream
Of the Roble Queen
Of many years ago,
Who picked her band
Of snakes by hand,
Though she wore her dresses low.
Her ruby lips were natural,
And no powder touched her face;
And her legs were made for walking
When low heels were no disgrace.
Her eyebrows were uncultured
But her brain still functions well,
All hail the good old queen of Roble!
Anna: .What's that?
Akbar. That's Palo Alto, the Lonesome Pine.
Anna: Sounds like a debater.
Akbar: Another viewpoint?
Anna: Said "Debater" indignant and miffy,
There's a nasty, mean man on the "Dippy,"
'Tho my voice does seem high,
I'm a pretty nice guy
And I think he's decidedly lippy."
Akbar: The tune is good but you remind me of Thurs
day's section boss.
Pino gang!
From the uproar of kissing of late,
Wc see what a drop one can take.
Women cnce thought no treat
To have MEN at their feet,
Now Trimb's drool is the best they can rate.
(Defenestretion of Akbar.)
—Exeunt Omnes.
Roble: — Heavens! I've lost my bar pin!
Redwood: —Never mind, I know a place where you
can get it without one.
