The Washington Conference.
Yesterday Secretaiy Hughes an- i
nounced that an agreement had been
reached between the United States
and Japan on the subject of Equal
Rights in the Island of Yap. The pact
is the culmination ol' negotiations bo
gun during Wilson's administration to
acquire the same rights for the United
States, being an associated nation, as
were acquired by the Allies who signed
the treaty of Versailles.
The United States is to have free
access to the Island of Yap, equal
rights with Japan or any other nation
in the use of the existing Yap-Guam
cable, and facilities for radio-tele
graphic service. America is granted
the right to buy additional cables and
establish other radio telegraphic sta
tions 011 the island, but promise to re
frain from doing so as long as the
Japanese furnish satisfactory service.
The four-power agreement is ready
for the signature of Hughes, Balfour,
Viviani, and Kato. The first attack
upon the work of the limitation of
arms conference came yesterday when
Senator Borah on the floor of the sen
ate denounced the tour-power pact. He
claims that Article 2, which provides
that a conference of the powers shall
decide on "the most efficient meas
ures" if their rights are threatened, is
a "war breeder."
The Irish Question.
Premier Craig of Ulster has de
j nounced the treaty of the English gov
j eminent with the Sinn Fein represen
; tatives, and claims that the "treaty
: does not fulfill solemn pledges made
to Ulster," but Ulster will neverthe
less remain loyal to the British Em
i pire.
President DeValera is continuing his
I opposition to the treaty and main

tains that Irish honor is not involved
in the ratification of the treaty. In a
speech yesterday he declared thai the
plenipotentiaries sent to London to ne
gotiate the treaty understood from the
first that the agreement reached \v >uld
have to be ratified by the Dail. or
failing that by the country. This would
seem to indicate that DeValera will
insist on a popular vote if the Dail up
holds the treaty.
