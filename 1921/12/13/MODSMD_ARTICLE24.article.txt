# Offices Will Be Moved in Administration Building
## 
### 
Several offices soon arc to be moved
in the Administration Building. The
Lower Division and the Dean of W omen
will take the space now occupied by the
Comptroller. The Accounting and Pur
chasing Department is to occupy all the
space on the west side of the second
floor except that now used by the Stu
dent Body. The Comptroller and his
secretary will move over to the rooms
now used by the Dean of Women, and
the Federal Board is to occupy the pres
ent office of Professor Mitchell.
This change will permit the consolida
tion of records of the Lower Division
and Registrar's office, thereby eliminat
ing considerable duplication.
