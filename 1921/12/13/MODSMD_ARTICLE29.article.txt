# MISS MARY YOST BRINGS WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE TO NEW OFFICE AS DEAN
## 
### 
In the three months that have elapsed
since her acceptance of the position of
i Dean of Women at Stanford, .Mis- Mary
Yost has won for herself the admiration
and affection of all with whom her office
brings her in contact. Through long ex
perience as student and teacher in
women's colleges and co-educational in
stitutions, she lias gained an insight into
the problems of student life which helps
| to qualify her for her position at Stan
I ford.
By birth iMiss Yost is a Virginian. She.
! was graduated from Vassar in 1904, and
after taking a year's advanced work in
English there, she became an assistant
| in the English department at Wellesley.
[ She returned the following year to Vas
sar where she became an instructor, and
jin 1912 received her Master's degree
j from that institution. In 1913, she be
came a teaching fellow at the Univer
sity of Michigan, but returned later to
I Vassar where she became an assistant
j professor. In 1917. she received her
degree of Doctor of Philosophy from
the University of Michigan.
While working for her Doctor's degree
at Michigan, Miss Yost made a com
j hined study of rhetoric and sociology
, as a broader foundation for the teach
ing of oratory and debate. She was
I especially interested in studying the ac
' tions of student groups, and the forma
j tion of student opinion.
j Since coming to Stanford, Miss Yost
j has been quick to grasp the problems
i which lie within her field and to lend

to them all the. zeal and enthusiasm
which is necessary to their solution".
In stating her conception of the obli
gations which devolve upon her office.
Miss Yost stated: "I consider that the
work of the dean of women lies pri
marily in co-ordinating the interests of
j women in the institution with the in
terests of the University at large. It
should be her effort to interpret to the
women students the ideals of the Uni
j versity, and in turn to interpret their
: standards, wishes, .and ideals, to the
University as a whole. Such co-ordina
tion is absolutely necessary to the elim
| ination of educational waste, not only
waste in the classroom but waste in the
whole student environment."
The housing, health, and social insti
! tution.s of the University deserve a
; great amount of consideration on the
j part of the dean of women, Miss Yost
maintains, and if there lie any undesir
able factor which militates against one
of these elements of student welfare, it
should he taken up with the student body
representatives or through them with
,the University officials, and its elimina
' tion secured.
It is by this clear understanding of
her relationship as mutual representa
: tive. between the women of the Univer
sity and the University at large that
Miss Yost has been able to take such
a decisive hold upon the problems which
have presented themselves, and has suc
ceeded in carrying out their solution to
the satisfaction and benefit of all con
cerned.
