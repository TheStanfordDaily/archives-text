## 
###

tion taken at the Conference meeting
in Portland. Oregon Agricultural Col
lege was originally granted the meet,
but it was forced to withdraw.
Arrangements for securing and ac
commodating teams from all of the
principal organizations of the coast are
now being undertaken by local swim
ming officials in cooperation with the
Graduate Manager's office. The date
is tentatively set for either April 15
or 22.
Oregon Agricultural College intend
ed to open its new swimming tank,
which is one of the best in the north
west, with the first Conference cham
pionships. O. A. C. officials decided,
however, that swimming is not as yet
upon a sound enough basis there.
Those universities which cannot
send a full team to Stanford are being
asked to be represented by two or
three of their best performers. Uni
versity of Southern California will
probably send Keuhn, who won the
spring-board diving at the Olympic
games.
With the completion of the high-div
ing tower at the lake, and with the
present pool at the Encina gymna

handle the big event.
