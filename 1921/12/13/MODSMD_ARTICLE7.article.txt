Although this team is strong and lias |
many brilliant players, Saturday's prac

ragged playing and slow passing. The I
redeeming features of the game were
a number of unexpected individual runs 1
from time to time that livened up the
otherwise, monotonous play.
The varsity will play the Palo Alto
All-Star Blacks, 011 Saturday, at 2:30(
o'clock in the Stadium. Ihe Palo Alto !
All-Star Blacks, coached by George
Green, is an organization of former j

will be the only opportunity offered
students to see the team play an out- i
side aggregation. There will be no ad- !
mittance change..
