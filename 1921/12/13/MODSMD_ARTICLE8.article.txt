### 
Christmas greeting cards, and a selec
-1 tion of seals, tags, and enclosure greet-
I ings, which are being sold in assorted
I boxes for the benefit of the social ser-
I vice work, in connection with the Stan
j ford Clinics, have been sent to the Presi
j dent's office by Mrs. Timothy Hopkins,
j of the Auxiliary Board, and may be ob
j taine.d there at fifty cents each. A box
| of ten greeting cards, for mailing, each
I of a differenet design, makes up one of
j the sets, and the other is composed of
| forty seals, fourteen tags, and twelve en
j closure cards. The latter selection has
j been chosen to aid in distinctive dress
j ing of Christmas packages, and jthe
j newest forms of decoration are used.
The sets are put up in Cardinal color
ed boxes, on the front of which is the
gold seal of the Auxiliary. This em
blem is an adaptation of the Universi
ty's Palo Alto Tree seal.
The Auxiliary to the Stanford Clin
ics in San Francisco, which is recog
nized as doing some of the best charity
and social service work in this connec
tion, received several thousand dollars
last year by the sale of these boxes,
all of which was devoted to Stanford
! charity work.
