# SEAY CUTS BABE BASKETBALL SQUAB
## 
### 
Coach Seay has cut his yearling
court squad to twenty-one men, and
with the beginning of next quarter he
will start the hard, drilling practice
which wlil bring out the merits of the
! eight or ten men who are to uphold
| Babe basketball honors this season.
Because of the large number of men
1 out for the squad and the inadequacy
| of court facilities, the freshmen have
i not been able to practice to the best
I advantage as yet. For the last week
! many of the men have not been out
i because of approaching examinations.
| But with the opening of the new quar-
I ter and the move to the pavilion, real
j practice scrimmages will be started.
Thus far, Shipke, forward; Hoffman,
j forward; Miduleton, center; and Hoop-
I er at guard, have showed much prom
ise and these men will undoubtedly
be the nucleus with which Seay will
start to carve out his quintet. Mc
-1 Closky and Dole, two men who played
|on the Babe gridiron team this fall,
will be out next quarter as strong
contenders for positions. Mc,Closky
plays at guard and Dole at forward.
The following men made the squad:
Alexander, Aydelott, Driscoll, Grace,
Harlow, Harris, Hayes, Hoffman,
: Hooper, Lawrence, Logan, Macrorie,
McCandless, O'Hara, Oliva, Penne
packer, Shipke, Thede, Wisely, and
Wright.
