# FRATERNITIES TO MEET MINIMUM RUSHING RULES
## Five Fraternities Refuse to Restrict Rushing to Short Period; Stick to Old Plan 
### 
In regard to the five members of the
Interfraternity Conference which have
temporarily refused to sign the new con
stitution adopted by the majority, Pre si
dent Wilbur has stated that these fra
ternities must meet the minimum re
quirements provided by the new laws.
All of the dissenting members \lpha
Delta Phi. Delta Kappa Kpsilon, Hcta
Theta Pi, Kappa Sigma, and Phi Kappa
Psiâ€”do not desire to cause a disruption
of the conference, and have announced

he is a desirable man whose time is
divided among a large group of
houses, to get to know him the way
they should to ask him to live in close
association with the other men of tlie
house during a four-year college
period. It is true that President Wil
bur has sanctioned the new constitu

he approves of it. On the other hand,
it is merely another step away from
the policy he announced several years
ago which should be pursued by fra
ternities if they wish to remain at
