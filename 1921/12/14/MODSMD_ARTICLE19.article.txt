ran up the largest score of the intra
mural season, by defeating the Break
ers' team, 40 to 7, in a fast court
be.tie last night.
The success of the winners Avas due
largely to their teamwork. Howell,
Alexander, and Kolberg, formed a
smooth-working machine and showed
some of the best team-play that has
been seen on the court this year. The
short, accurate basket shooting of
Alexander, and Howell further added
to the effectiveness of this combina
tion.
Alexander kept his actions close to
the court, and was very good on side
shots by which he made a considerable
number of his ten baskets. Mint How
ell played fast ball and scored only
two less baskets than Alexander. How
ell is particularly able in receiving
â€¢passes close to and getting the toss
away quickly. Austin, D. T. D., played
a strong game as running guard, be
ing a very good dribbler.
Lowenstein with his steady playing,
was the main-stay of the Breakers'
quintet. Peavy showed planty of fight,
and threw his team's lone pair of
baskets, the other three points being
made by Lowenstein on free throws.

which was unable to score against the
Breakers. The return of the first
string men started the parade. This
game finishes the schedule for the
