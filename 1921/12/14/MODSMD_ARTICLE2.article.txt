## 
### 
A managerial plan, as outlined by W.
R. Gage, was adopted by the sophomores
at a meeting of that class, held yester
day afternoon in room 214. According
Id tlie plan, the office of class manager
will be created which will supplant the
treasurership. The manager, who will
be appointed by the. president, will have
as his duties to audit all committee ex
penditures, to liquidate his administra
tion's share of the class debt, which is
now in the neighborhood of $1,300. and
to make a complete report of his work
before retirement from office. The plan
also states that he is to become auto
matically a member of any committee
which has to deal with financial matters.
The first manager is to he appointed by
the next president, who will be elected
in the middle part of February. This
plan was promoted by the excessive ex
penditures of committees in the past. So
far the 1924 class has been the first to
adopt this scheme.
President F. W. Kauffman was an
thorized by the class to appoint a com
mittee to investigate the management
of the cotillion. Chairmans John Richer
and Mat hew Tobrincr of the cotillion
and play committees, respectively, gave
partial reports of their work, as so many
outstanding bills made a complete, re
port impossible. Treasurer Charles
Charles Chandler also made a report.
Beverley Bailliard was given a sweat
er for participation in freshmen wrest
ling last year.
