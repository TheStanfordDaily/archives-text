# Commendable Action.

### 
Five fraternities are to he commended upon the
stand they have taken in refusing to ratify the new
constitution of the I titer fraternity Conference. In
withholding their ratification they are acting upon
principles that should he widespread among all living
groups. Realizing that the new constitution differs
very little from the old one, which proved to be inef
fective, they have refused to sanction it, although
there were eighteen other votes against them.
These five fraternities realize that it is to the good
of the whole group, which comprises approximately
seven hundred men, to have a strong central gov
erning body, one that will enforce the rules which
should govern all and to which all have assented.
The Interfraternity Conference as it now stands is
like the spineless jelly-fish. What might have formed
a substantial spine has struck against the main gela
tinous body and has gone clear through and out the
other side, which in this case appears to be the right
side. They now stand apart from the main govern
ing body strictly upon principles which they believe
to be jnst.
There are two main points of disagreement be
tween the five and the eighteen fraternities. The
first one is in the matter of the length of the rush
ing period. The second, the matter of severe pen
alties for violations of the pact. We do not propose
lo enter into a discussion of these points here. The
obvious advantages and disadvantages of the short
and long rushing period, and the matter of penal
ties have already been thoroughly discussed by the
parties concerned. It all resolves itself into a mat
ter of strong organization. As long as pledging is
on a competitive basis there will be no end to the
dissatisfaction and accompanying petty factional
quarrels that tend to weaken the fraternity system.
Factions are formed which lead to the disintegra
tion of the main governing body. This is the un
derlying cause of the present trouble.
The remedy is a strong constitution backed up by
severe penalties for violation of the contract which
each fraternity enters into upon joining the Confer
ence. To be forceful, such penalties must be in
flicted which will cause the offenders who now break
the pact with impunity, by virtue of factional
strength, to observe the rules to the veriest letter.
A constitution, if it is to govern, must, in the
first instance, be judiciously formed. In the second
place, it must carry some means of enforcement.
Trouble like the present one will be recurrent until
lb fraternities forget their little petty factional quar
rels and get together for the good of the whole
system, and the promotion of the welfare of the
University, which should be the prime reason for
their existence.
The fi\e fraternities which have refused to ratify
the new constitution have realized this, and they are
now in a position to straighten up the whole affair.
They have declared themselves on principles which
are recognized as stringent but j'ust, and they form
the nucleus for a better organization.
These five fraternities will stand as the group that
will appeal to the most desirable entering men who
may wish to join fraternities, as organizations of
strong principle, and unless the others adopt the
rules for which this group stands they will be placed
in a position of secondary importance in the scale
of fraternities.

the nucleus for a better organization.
These five fraternities will stand as the group that
will appeal to the most desirable entering men who
may wish to join fraternities, as organizations of
strong principle, and unless the others adopt the
rules for which this group stands they will be placed
in a position of secondary importance in the scale
of fraternities.

Five fraternities are to he commended upon the
stand they have taken in refusing to ratify the new
constitution of the I titer fraternity Conference. In
withholding their ratification they are acting upon
principles that should he widespread among all living
groups. Realizing that the new constitution differs
very little from the old one, which proved to be inef
fective, they have refused to sanction it, although
there were eighteen other votes against them.
These five fraternities realize that it is to the good
of the whole group, which comprises approximately
seven hundred men, to have a strong central gov
erning body, one that will enforce the rules which
should govern all and to which all have assented.
The Interfraternity Conference as it now stands is
like the spineless jelly-fish. What might have formed
a substantial spine has struck against the main gela
tinous body and has gone clear through and out the
other side, which in this case appears to be the right
side. They now stand apart from the main govern
ing body strictly upon principles which they believe
to be jnst.
There are two main points of disagreement be
tween the five and the eighteen fraternities. The
first one is in the matter of the length of the rush
ing period. The second, the matter of severe pen
alties for violations of the pact. We do not propose
lo enter into a discussion of these points here. The
obvious advantages and disadvantages of the short
and long rushing period, and the matter of penal
ties have already been thoroughly discussed by the
parties concerned. It all resolves itself into a mat
ter of strong organization. As long as pledging is
on a competitive basis there will be no end to the
dissatisfaction and accompanying petty factional
quarrels that tend to weaken the fraternity system.
Factions are formed which lead to the disintegra
tion of the main governing body. This is the un
derlying cause of the present trouble.
The remedy is a strong constitution backed up by
severe penalties for violation of the contract which
each fraternity enters into upon joining the Confer
ence. To be forceful, such penalties must be in
flicted which will cause the offenders who now break
the pact with impunity, by virtue of factional
strength, to observe the rules to the veriest letter.
A constitution, if it is to govern, must, in the
first instance, be judiciously formed. In the second
place, it must carry some means of enforcement.
Trouble like the present one will be recurrent until
lb fraternities forget their little petty factional quar
rels and get together for the good of the whole
system, and the promotion of the welfare of the
University, which should be the prime reason for
their existence.
The fi\e fraternities which have refused to ratify
the new constitution have realized this, and they are
now in a position to straighten up the whole affair.
They have declared themselves on principles which
are recognized as stringent but j'ust, and they form
the nucleus for a better organization.
