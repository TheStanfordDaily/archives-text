# Enforcing the Honor System.

### 
There is evidently a great deal of uncertainty in
the mind of the average student as to the proper
thing to do when he someone violating the
Honor System in examinations. He naturally hesi
tates to take upon himself the job of tale-bearer, and
vet realizes that he can not be true to his university
and himself if he lets it go unnoticed.
The practical way that has worked best has been
the case, and they, as a group, may approach the
found to be this: Anyone who notices cheating may
confer with a few of his fellow students 011
guilty party and warn him that unless he stops his
practice they will bring the case before the Men's
Council. If this should have 110 effect, the group of
students, three or four or more, as the case may be,
should lay their complaint before the Council. In
this way the feeling of individual responsibility is
lessened and a greater effect is produced. This has
been found by the Council to have worked success
fully in many cases, and is probably the best way to
handle a difficult situation.
