Ad asks for three passengers to stop over night at
Paso Robles. Destination kept dark.
What's the use, if there's a chaperone along?

Cabbages' Christmas Suggestions:
For Pa —Handsome engraved check-book.

Hugo, the midnight mothfi made a high mark on the
wall when he remarked that since the honor system has
been imposed, we'll have to depend on hitting the line

Orator eagerly and enthusiastically declaims against
perforated criticism. Maybe high voice sent argument
over head of critic. Maybe reporter was annoyed and
discouraged at altitude, and returned to his pleasure.
Maybe we can settle it yet. Have surprised debater and
chagrined but wily reporter meet in intellectual con
test, with assorted steeplejacks as audience to follow
arguments. Judges to render decision on violin.

The following questions for debate have been taken
up with the elevator boy:
Food vs. Drink As a Means of Living. Ten minutes
for the affirmative, five for the negative.
Who will be the Next President? Hughes or Hard
ing? Five minutes for the affirmative, five for the
negative, and five for the referee.
Resolved, that the 801 l Weevil Blues are Worse Than
the Song by That Name. Four minutes for the affirma
tive and a meat axe for the negative.
Why Does Lloyd George Spell His First Name with
Three L's? No time limit. (Twelve o'clock Saturday
nights).

We wonder, what were the names of those valiant
men who got caught trying to steal chickens from the
president's hen-coop last week?

But of course we wouldn't print that information if
we received it. Generally, though, our motto is "All

Weather reported to favor Cardinal. Many red noses
on the Quad. Sounds suspicious. Page the Men's

It's fun to read the column called "Cabbages and
Things,"
And think what rotten humor creeps in this page for
kings.
It's fun to see your name here, and rate a razz so
fine,
By no less than a conductor on the Cabbage railroad
line.
But when said wop clod-heaver starts heaving bricks
at fact,
It's time to call a halt, boys, and go back mending
tracks.
How could a mere road worker be sure that height is
grace,
Or whether quite the opposite is true? —that states the
case.'
And scj, boys, just this warning, before you queer your
line so punk,
With campus roughs and co-eds; don't mix intelligence
with bunk! —W.W.C.
* * *
The art craze is again upon us. Not to be behind the
times, we publish below a list of select views that may
be seen at the Cabbage Art Gallery:
* * *
"Study in Still Life" —Done in oil by the painter of
"Moonshine Blues." Background of bottles, interspersed
with more bottles.
"Afloat on a Custard Pudding"—Done intentionally
by Horace Horsehide, famous depicteur of Western
Pacific scenes.
"Not Guilty"— A scene at the bar, by the same artist
that made the first mistake.
"Tax Collector, with Tacks" —Done in water colors.
in a trance, by a retreaded sea-captain.
* * #
"Your Ford Deserves a Willard" —Ad. From the way
some of 'em look, they've just had a Dempsey.
* * *
Household hints:—Never eat crackers in bed.
