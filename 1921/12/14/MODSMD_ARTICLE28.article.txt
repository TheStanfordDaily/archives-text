Dear Editor:
Is it wise for the people of the
United Stat® to foster a spirit of de
pendency upon us on the part of cer
tain European countries? It seems
that there is hardly a small European
country hut that feels called upon to
draw from the coffers of this nation
whenever it finds that it is in an un
fortunate situation due to the corrup
tion and mismanagement of its affairs.
In the springs and summers of the
years that have followed the war, in
stead of getting down to work and at
tempting to sow crops that would make
for comfort during the coming winter,
many of these people have fought
their small neighbors over the title to
a couple of acres of land, or if such a
quarrel was not to be found, they
started to overthrow their own gov
ernment. Some more sober member
of their nation would, perhaps, in
quire whether such an attitude was
wise. He would point to the nearby
winter and its terrors. But those who
craved action and were unwilling to
settle down to hard labor could al
ways reply, "Why work? The United
States will educate and feed us this
winter. They are rich and ought to
have the care of us. Let's fight and
he merry—for when winter comes we
will be provided for." If the United
States refuses to furnish free education,
free, food awl free clothes to these peo
ples, they feel aggrieved. In short, in
order to keep their good will we must
pay their bills This is "International
Fellowship." These little nations for
get that this country is now helping
them out of kindness, and they consider
that it is the DUTY of our Republic
to pay their expenses. When e.x-Presi
dent Wilson supported Italy in this just
claim, they sang his praises. But when
he would not support their selfish claims,
they did not remember his kifid acts, but
wanted to kill him. That is "Interna
tional Fellowship." Likewise this con
stant year after year cry on the part of
representatives of the small European
countries for help every winter is apt
to result in the same attitude 011 their
part, if we e.ver find it unwise to respond.
I read an article not long ago by a !
newspaper man who had just finished '
a tour through some of these little |
countries and he stated that the United j
States was regarded as the )>reat Inter- I
national Sucker by the natives over \
there. In other words, arc we not by !
giving help making the object of our j
charity unfit to grasp the daily problems I
that confront him, and solve them by i
hard work ? France suffered most dur- J
ing the war —yet she is working. Ger-;
many is working, and is according to '
reports going to be a mighty commercial j
power in the near future. If work will
accomplish such wonders —why not let j
these other appreciate the ;
necessity and value of more work and {
less war. Is it not about time that j
these continual cries for help cease? i
This nation does not have to go outside
its borders to find those who need food j
and clothing. It does not have to hunt |
up some Furopean to find an individual |
who needs an education, but due to high |
tuition or some unfortunate financial •
condition cannot make the most of his !
abilities. We have helped and for that
help let no one object. Rut when will '
this ever-increasing demand stop? In
America, is it not time that we clean
up our own backyard, and let England
for example sing the International for a i
while.

Dear Editor:
Is it wise for the people of the
United Stat® to foster a spirit of de
pendency upon us on the part of cer
tain European countries? It seems
that there is hardly a small European
country hut that feels called upon to
draw from the coffers of this nation
whenever it finds that it is in an un
fortunate situation due to the corrup
tion and mismanagement of its affairs.
In the springs and summers of the
years that have followed the war, in
stead of getting down to work and at
tempting to sow crops that would make
for comfort during the coming winter,
many of these people have fought
their small neighbors over the title to
a couple of acres of land, or if such a
quarrel was not to be found, they
started to overthrow their own gov
ernment. Some more sober member
of their nation would, perhaps, in
quire whether such an attitude was
wise. He would point to the nearby
winter and its terrors. But those who
craved action and were unwilling to
settle down to hard labor could al
ways reply, "Why work? The United
States will educate and feed us this
winter. They are rich and ought to
have the care of us. Let's fight and
he merry—for when winter comes we
will be provided for." If the United
States refuses to furnish free education,
free, food awl free clothes to these peo
ples, they feel aggrieved. In short, in
order to keep their good will we must
pay their bills This is "International
Fellowship." These little nations for
get that this country is now helping
them out of kindness, and they consider
that it is the DUTY of our Republic
to pay their expenses. When e.x-Presi
dent Wilson supported Italy in this just
claim, they sang his praises. But when
he would not support their selfish claims,
they did not remember his kifid acts, but
wanted to kill him. That is "Interna
tional Fellowship." Likewise this con
stant year after year cry on the part of
representatives of the small European
countries for help every winter is apt
to result in the same attitude 011 their
part, if we e.ver find it unwise to respond.
I read an article not long ago by a !
newspaper man who had just finished '
a tour through some of these little |
countries and he stated that the United j
States was regarded as the )>reat Inter- I
national Sucker by the natives over \
there. In other words, arc we not by !
giving help making the object of our j
charity unfit to grasp the daily problems I
that confront him, and solve them by i
hard work ? France suffered most dur- J
ing the war —yet she is working. Ger-;
many is working, and is according to '
reports going to be a mighty commercial j
power in the near future. If work will
accomplish such wonders —why not let j
these other appreciate the ;
necessity and value of more work and {
less war. Is it not about time that j
these continual cries for help cease? i
This nation does not have to go outside
its borders to find those who need food j
and clothing. It does not have to hunt |
up some Furopean to find an individual |
who needs an education, but due to high |
tuition or some unfortunate financial •
condition cannot make the most of his !
abilities. We have helped and for that
help let no one object. Rut when will '
this ever-increasing demand stop? In
America, is it not time that we clean
up our own backyard, and let England
for example sing the International for a i
while.
