# HOOF LEADERS SET SEASON'S PACE FOR INTRAMURAL FIVES
## 
### 
Comparative strength of the teams in
the four intramural basketball leagues
is beginning to be apparent. However,
the quintets which show the greatest
promise now may be materially weak
ened next quarter by the loss of men
to the varsity and freshman squads.
In league one, Phi Kappa Sigma and
| the Japanese Club are the strongest
contenders, each having won two games.
The Japanese combination of Koba, Ki
-1 tow. and Mizota offer a brand of team
' work hard to beat. Delta Kappa Ep
' silon won its first-round contest with
J Phi Kappa Psi, and has a perfect per
centage so far. El Cuado, Chi Psi, and
Alpha Chi Sigma have lost both first
and second round contests.
League two is headed by Theta Chi.
! The stellar playing of Dwight Roberts
i was an important factor in Theta Chi
large score victories over Sequoia and
: Sigma Xu. Sigma .Alpha Fpsilon and
i Zeta Psi follow with no defeats. The
S. A. E. five will lose Doughty, their
i best player, to the varsity squad next
J quarter. Zeta Psi has not played yet,
1 but has shown up well in practice. Sig
ma Nu has won and lost a game. Se
quoia One, El Capitan, Commuters, and
Omega Chi Alpha dropped their lir>t
round games.
Alpha Lambda has made the best bid
so far for the honors of the third league.
The team plays as a unit and the indi
viduals are in fine basketball condition.
Cornell. Rawlins, and Home form the
scoring combine. El Toro and Alpha
Tau Omega captured their games. 011
the El Toro team, Hoffman stands out
as a star, while Neill and Phelps are
the point winners for the A. T. O.
quintet. Kappa Alpha, also, maintains
an unmarred record in this yeague. Se
quoia Two, Phi Gamma Delta, and Un
attached have lost games.
In league four, Kappa Sigma has won
three games and lost none. After the
freshman squad has recruited from this
team, the present strong combination of
Shipke, Middleton, and Hood will be
broken up. El Campo has won both its
court battles, defeating Beta Theta Pi
in the second. Encina Four has a 1,000
percentage. The Delta Upsilon and Beta
Theta Pi teams have lost two and three
games, respectively.
Perhaps the two best teams in all the
leagues, Phi Delta Theta and Alpha
Delta Phi. are in the fifth league. How
ever, Phi Delta Theta will lose Logan
and O'Hara to the freshman squad, and.
perhaps, Fletcher to the varsity. Alpha
Delta Phi will miss Gerson and prob
ably others. Delta Chi defeated Theta
Delta Chi in the first round. Delta Tau
Delta has won and lost once. Theta
Delta Chi, and Alpha Sigma Phi have
lost one game, and the. Breaker- two.
