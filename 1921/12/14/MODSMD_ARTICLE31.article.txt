# EDWARD MASLIN HULME, '97, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, IS AUTHOR AND HISTORIAN
## 
### 
Stanford is exceedingly fortunate
j this year in having added to its His
tory Department Professor Edward
Maslin Hulme, a man of world-wide
i reputation as a scholar, a professor,
| and a writer. Professor Hulme comes
to Stanford from the University of
Idaho, where he was professor of his-
I tory for nineteen years. He is a Stan
ford man, and his acceptance of the
associate professor's chair in the His
j tory Department is in reality a return
to the "Farm."
Professor Hulme's early life was
I spent in hard work in the business
: world. He was always fond of books
and spent much of his spare time
reading. A fortunate circumstance
| made it possible for him to come to
j Stanford. While yet a boy, lie was a
I shipping clerk in a large wholesale
firm in Portland, Oregon, spending his
leisure hours writing musical and dra
■ matic criticisms for Portland news
j papers. A Portland business man
whose son had entered Stanford when
j the institution first opened its doors
took a great deal of interest in the
| young man's literary work, and insisted
| that he should come to Stanford. Ac
i cordingly, in September of 1892, he en
tered Stanford without a single en
i trance requirement, without a high
I school education and less than £40 in
I his pockets. Earning his way through
college, he gradually made up his en
trance requirements, and in five years
graduated with the class of 1897. While
in college he was editor of the Quad
| in '97, and in his senior year he was
j editor-in-chief of the Sequoia, the liter
ary magazine of the University. Will
! and Wallace Irwin, writers who have
! since acquired national fame, were
j members of the staff of the Sequoia
j at the time he was editor. During his
i first year in University he lived in a
' clubhouse in Palo Alto with a group
j of men which included Herbert Hoo
[ ver. His last four years were spent
in Encina Hall.
"I remember the life of those days 1
verv vividly," says Professor Hulme. '
! "The inner quadrangle and a few en
gineering buildings behind it were the
only college buildings, aside from the
j dormitories. We all knew each other
j in those days. Life on the farm was ■
(very simple and democratic. Dr. Jor- !
! dan was in the prime of his physical
| vigor, and he was a great inspiration.
I We were all proud of him and looked
up to him. knowing him to possess un
mistakably the elements of greatness." 1
After leaving college, Professor
Hulme taught for three years in the
high school in Portland, Oregon, going
from there to Harvard, Cornell, anrl
Paris for graduate work. Finishing
his graduate work, he went to the
1 University of Idaho to teach and re
mained there for nineteen years. He
t-aught at the University of Chicago,
the University of California, and one
quarter at Stanford before becoming
| an associate professor at Stanford. He
has recently returned from a year's
trip to Europe.
His book on the "Renaissance and
Reformation" was published in 1914.

I Since then, it has been adopted as
| the text in its subject by some eighty
'colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Chi
cago, Princeton, Pennsylvania, and Co
lumbia. The book was also published
jin London. Newspapers and maga
zines in Europe and America hailed it
as the most comprehensive book on
the subject in existence, the London
Times, the Pall Mall Gazette of Lon
don, and the Atlantic Monthly devot
ing a great deal of space to a favor
, able criticism of the work and the au
thor. President Nicholas Murray But
ler of Columbia University, refers to
the book as an "Educational Review."
I Professor Hulme's position as an au
thority on the Middle Ages is so firmly
established throughout the United
States that he has been asked to write
a book covering that period for a new
series of historical works which is to
, be published in the near future.
He has just finished a translation of
j Gebhart's "L'ltalie Mystique," a book
, dealing with the intellectual and spirit
j ual life of Italy in the last two cen
turies of the Middle Ages. The trans
lation is prefaced by a study of the
\ life and work of Gebhart, and will
probably be published in the spring of
i 1022.
The esteem in which Professor
Hulme was held at the University of
1 Idaho is well illustrated by the fol
' lowing editorial which appeared in
| the student newspaper when it be
| came known that he was to come to
'Stanford: "Dean Hulme has endeared
himself to students and alumni, and
to the entire state of Idaho, by his
many years of service in the univer
: sity. He is a rare combination of
scholar and public man, and is an in-
I spiring figure in the classroom and on
the public platform. He is known, re
spected, and loved throughout the
state." —President Upham.
In but one quarter at Stanford, Pro
fessor Hulme has endeared himself to
] all those who have come into contact
i with him in the classroom and on the
Quad. He has come here as a Stan
ford man and has been received as a
Stanford man; and his stay will un
doubtedly be of great benefit to him
self and to Stanford.

Hulme was held at the University of
1 Idaho is well illustrated by the fol
' lowing editorial which appeared in
| the student newspaper when it be
| came known that he was to come to
'Stanford: "Dean Hulme has endeared
himself to students and alumni, and
to the entire state of Idaho, by his
many years of service in the univer
: sity. He is a rare combination of
scholar and public man, and is an in-
I spiring figure in the classroom and on
the public platform. He is known, re
spected, and loved throughout the
state." —President Upham.
In but one quarter at Stanford, Pro
fessor Hulme has endeared himself to
] all those who have come into contact
i with him in the classroom and on the
Quad. He has come here as a Stan
ford man and has been received as a
Stanford man; and his stay will un
doubtedly be of great benefit to him
self and to Stanford.
Stanford is exceedingly fortunate
j this year in having added to its His
tory Department Professor Edward
Maslin Hulme, a man of world-wide
i reputation as a scholar, a professor,
| and a writer. Professor Hulme comes
to Stanford from the University of
Idaho, where he was professor of his-
I tory for nineteen years. He is a Stan
ford man, and his acceptance of the
associate professor's chair in the His
j tory Department is in reality a return
to the "Farm."
Professor Hulme's early life was
I spent in hard work in the business
: world. He was always fond of books
and spent much of his spare time
reading. A fortunate circumstance
| made it possible for him to come to
j Stanford. While yet a boy, lie was a
I shipping clerk in a large wholesale
firm in Portland, Oregon, spending his
leisure hours writing musical and dra
■ matic criticisms for Portland news
j papers. A Portland business man
whose son had entered Stanford when
j the institution first opened its doors
took a great deal of interest in the
| young man's literary work, and insisted
| that he should come to Stanford. Ac
i cordingly, in September of 1892, he en
tered Stanford without a single en
i trance requirement, without a high
I school education and less than £40 in
I his pockets. Earning his way through
college, he gradually made up his en
trance requirements, and in five years
graduated with the class of 1897. While
in college he was editor of the Quad
| in '97, and in his senior year he was
j editor-in-chief of the Sequoia, the liter
ary magazine of the University. Will
! and Wallace Irwin, writers who have
! since acquired national fame, were
j members of the staff of the Sequoia
j at the time he was editor. During his
i first year in University he lived in a
' clubhouse in Palo Alto with a group
j of men which included Herbert Hoo
[ ver. His last four years were spent
in Encina Hall.
"I remember the life of those days 1
verv vividly," says Professor Hulme. '
! "The inner quadrangle and a few en
gineering buildings behind it were the
only college buildings, aside from the
j dormitories. We all knew each other
j in those days. Life on the farm was ■
(very simple and democratic. Dr. Jor- !
! dan was in the prime of his physical
| vigor, and he was a great inspiration.
I We were all proud of him and looked
up to him. knowing him to possess un
mistakably the elements of greatness." 1
After leaving college, Professor
Hulme taught for three years in the
high school in Portland, Oregon, going
from there to Harvard, Cornell, anrl
Paris for graduate work. Finishing
his graduate work, he went to the
1 University of Idaho to teach and re
mained there for nineteen years. He
t-aught at the University of Chicago,
the University of California, and one
quarter at Stanford before becoming
| an associate professor at Stanford. He
has recently returned from a year's
trip to Europe.
His book on the "Renaissance and
Reformation" was published in 1914.

I Since then, it has been adopted as
| the text in its subject by some eighty
'colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Chi
cago, Princeton, Pennsylvania, and Co
lumbia. The book was also published
jin London. Newspapers and maga
zines in Europe and America hailed it
as the most comprehensive book on
the subject in existence, the London
Times, the Pall Mall Gazette of Lon
don, and the Atlantic Monthly devot
ing a great deal of space to a favor
, able criticism of the work and the au
thor. President Nicholas Murray But
ler of Columbia University, refers to
the book as an "Educational Review."
I Professor Hulme's position as an au
thority on the Middle Ages is so firmly
established throughout the United
States that he has been asked to write
a book covering that period for a new
series of historical works which is to
, be published in the near future.
He has just finished a translation of
j Gebhart's "L'ltalie Mystique," a book
, dealing with the intellectual and spirit
j ual life of Italy in the last two cen
turies of the Middle Ages. The trans
lation is prefaced by a study of the
\ life and work of Gebhart, and will
probably be published in the spring of
i 1022.

Stanford is exceedingly fortunate
j this year in having added to its His
tory Department Professor Edward
Maslin Hulme, a man of world-wide
i reputation as a scholar, a professor,
| and a writer. Professor Hulme comes
to Stanford from the University of
Idaho, where he was professor of his-
I tory for nineteen years. He is a Stan
ford man, and his acceptance of the
associate professor's chair in the His
j tory Department is in reality a return
to the "Farm."
Professor Hulme's early life was
I spent in hard work in the business
: world. He was always fond of books
and spent much of his spare time
reading. A fortunate circumstance
| made it possible for him to come to
j Stanford. While yet a boy, lie was a
I shipping clerk in a large wholesale
firm in Portland, Oregon, spending his
leisure hours writing musical and dra
■ matic criticisms for Portland news
j papers. A Portland business man
whose son had entered Stanford when
j the institution first opened its doors
took a great deal of interest in the
| young man's literary work, and insisted
| that he should come to Stanford. Ac
i cordingly, in September of 1892, he en
tered Stanford without a single en
i trance requirement, without a high
I school education and less than £40 in
I his pockets. Earning his way through
college, he gradually made up his en
trance requirements, and in five years
graduated with the class of 1897. While
in college he was editor of the Quad
| in '97, and in his senior year he was
j editor-in-chief of the Sequoia, the liter
ary magazine of the University. Will
! and Wallace Irwin, writers who have
! since acquired national fame, were
j members of the staff of the Sequoia
j at the time he was editor. During his
i first year in University he lived in a
' clubhouse in Palo Alto with a group
j of men which included Herbert Hoo
[ ver. His last four years were spent
in Encina Hall.
"I remember the life of those days 1
verv vividly," says Professor Hulme. '
! "The inner quadrangle and a few en
gineering buildings behind it were the
only college buildings, aside from the
j dormitories. We all knew each other
j in those days. Life on the farm was ■
(very simple and democratic. Dr. Jor- !
! dan was in the prime of his physical
| vigor, and he was a great inspiration.
I We were all proud of him and looked
up to him. knowing him to possess un
mistakably the elements of greatness." 1
After leaving college, Professor
Hulme taught for three years in the
high school in Portland, Oregon, going
from there to Harvard, Cornell, anrl
Paris for graduate work. Finishing
his graduate work, he went to the
1 University of Idaho to teach and re
mained there for nineteen years. He
t-aught at the University of Chicago,
the University of California, and one
quarter at Stanford before becoming
| an associate professor at Stanford. He
has recently returned from a year's
trip to Europe.
His book on the "Renaissance and
Reformation" was published in 1914.

I Since then, it has been adopted as
| the text in its subject by some eighty
'colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Chi
cago, Princeton, Pennsylvania, and Co
lumbia. The book was also published
jin London. Newspapers and maga
zines in Europe and America hailed it
as the most comprehensive book on
the subject in existence, the London
Times, the Pall Mall Gazette of Lon
don, and the Atlantic Monthly devot
ing a great deal of space to a favor
, able criticism of the work and the au
thor. President Nicholas Murray But
