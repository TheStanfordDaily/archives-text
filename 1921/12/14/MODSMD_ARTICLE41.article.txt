Day Parade, in Santa Ana." said Mrs.
Wilhelmina Jacobs, '20, in a letter re
ceived by J. E. McDowell, Alumni Sec
retary.
Mrs. Jacobs continued tlifit 15 by 30
foot Stanford banner was carried chil
dren wearing white dresses and red
crepe paper hats. The banner was pre
ceded by a car decorated with red and
white pompoms and a large block "S"
