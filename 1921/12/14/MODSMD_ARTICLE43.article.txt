# TWO ARTISTS DISPLAY WORK AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
Examples of the work of Mrs. J. 1
Vennerstrom Cannon and W. H. Clapp
form the exhibit in the small galleries
at the Art Gallery.
Mrs. Cannon's picture display is
composed of a number of studio paint
ings and interspersed with a number
of field sketches. Her style is a broad,
free us of the brush, with the paint
strokes at a slight distance falling into
land and sky and water areas, to give
vibrating light and color. This is
shown especially in her marine
sketches.
The pictures of W. H. Clapp consist
of oil paintings, monotypes, and chalk
drawings The paintings include im
pressionistic types and examples of
other school methods. Pedro Lemos,
curator of the museum, characterizes
him as an artist who is a student of !
technique and seems able to follow j
any style and follow it well. His mono- :
types are excellently produced and his
individual studies are unusual in di
rectness and appeal." The collection
illustrates the versatility of the artist.;
showing as well a good collection of j
subjects.
