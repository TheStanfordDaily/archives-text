# PECAN NUTS PROVEN TO BE SUBSTITUTE FOR DIET OF MEAT
## 
### 
Pecan nuts have been proven to fur
nish a perfectly adequate protein nu
trition in place of meat, as a result of
experiments recently* completed by Flo
rian A. Cajori, instructor in physiolo
gical chemistry. Rats were used by Mr.
Cajori in conducting his investigations,
which started last winter. Some of the
animals were kept on a pecan nut diet
from the time they were very small un
til they were completely matured, and it
was found that they grew just as nat
urally as those who were fed upon meat.
The discovery of the food properties
of pecan nuts is felt to be of great value,
since the pecan is one of the most im
portant of American nuts. It is grown
extensively in the southern states, espe
cially Texas, and is being used more
and more for food. Pecans will be ex
tremely important as a possible substi
tute for meat, if the diminishing of
meat production, due to taking up of
range lands, continues to increase.
The use of rats in conducting the ex
periments was chosen because the re
sults on these animals may usually be
applied at once 011 human nutrition, and
because they are easiest to care for.
