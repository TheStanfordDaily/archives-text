# INTERCLASS BOXING TOURNAMENT CLOSES WITH FAST BOUT
## 
### 
Interclass boxing wound up with a fast
bout Monday afternon. Charle- defeated
Murphy in a well-fought match which
| was anybody's until the final round. 1 he
i first round went to Charles by a shade,
j and the second was about even, but in
the final round Charles was able to pile
I up a big lead owing to his superior con
dition.
Five men won their class numerals in
; the tournament. Some high class var
| sity material was developed in the
matches, and Coach Maloney is highly
\ pleased with the showing made by the
men.
In the bantam weight class, Brad Sim
mons, '23, defeated all comers. Simmons
: was a varsity boxer last year and looks
to be in the best of shape for the com-
I ing season. Kenny Shipp, '23, fought
I his way to the top in the featherweight
[class through stiff competition. Shipp
I is a promising prospect for the varsity
this year. He packs a wicked punch in
either hand, and is a very hard man to
hit. Penwe.il, '23, and Jack Fishburn.

24, fought a draw in the finals, light-
I weight division, and both w ill be granted
I their numerals. Both of these men are
promising material and with a little
more experience should develop into
jdangerous men with the mitts. Charles,
i'2s, by defeating Murphy in the welter
weight division won his numerals.
! Several trips have already been planned
t tor the boxing squad in the winter quar
ter, and indications point to a success
; fill season for the Stanford pugilists.
; Coach Maloney will devote a great ileal
| of his time next quarter to coaching the
boxers, and he expects to develop some
men who will be strong contender- for
| the intercollegiate honors.
