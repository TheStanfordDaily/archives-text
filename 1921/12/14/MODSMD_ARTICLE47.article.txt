Contained in the. last issue of the
| j American Relief Administration Hullo
| tin is an article by John P. Gregg. '15,
jon "Conditions in the Tartar Socialist
Soviet Republic of Russia." Mr. Gregg
who was a member of Alpha Delta Phi
i lon the campus, was a captain in the army
| j during the war, and immediately after
i ward joined the American Relief Ad
! ministration. Under this organization
he went first to Belgrade., then to War
: saw. Poland, and is now in the famine
stricken Volga district of Russia. Of
! the ghastly difficulties under which tin
government is laboring and of the reliei
[ measures being taken, he writes :
''The need for relief in this country is
j beyond anything I have ever seen, and
every step taken to speed up action on
food will save lives. The River Volga,
usually the mosf fertile valley of Ku
rope, has so long been seeded without
rotation or rest that an unprecedent
drought this year resulted in a com
! plete failure of crops. The consequence
1 of this calamity has been, primarily,
starvation in the villages and its ap
proach in the cities."
In speaking of relief measures taken
by the government, Gregg says:
"The government is at present direct
ing all its efforts to supplying the seed
grain to plant next year's crops. In or
der to facilitate planting, and the trans
portation of some 150,000,000 poods of
grain which have been received from Si
i beria, the government has ordered all
! migration to cease under pain of severe
j penalties.
"The government has informed its em
\ ployees that all food must hereafter be
purchased, and has warned the Republic
that it must face the probability of an
j absolute lack of supplies this winter.
"The attitude of the peasant is one of
j resignation to the situation and to death
if necessary; they are still hopeful of
' some form of relief."
Two other Stanford men are among
the personnel of the Russian mission.
They art Professor John Sellards of the
Romanic Languages Department and
j Frank Golder of the History Depart
j ment. Professor Golder is also collect
j ing in Europe for Stanford's War Me
; morial Fund.
