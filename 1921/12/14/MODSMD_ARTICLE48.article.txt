# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
The disarmament conference, due to
close before Christmas, still holds the
j main part of center stage, despite such
| things as prohibition raid* and suicide
aftermaths. The United States, Great
Britain, Japan, and France have at last
signed a four-power agreement which
! gives promise, at least, of easing the sit
uation in the Pacific. It was recognized
that question* such as the famous Yap
controversy would have to be settled
before this could be done, and an agree
ment reached a few days ago made the
final signing of the treaty possible.
But trouble is expected when the
treaty comes before the Senate for rati
fication. It does not seem improbable
that the necessary two-thirds vote will
be forthcoming, so that the agreement
may be ratified at once; but some of the
same group that opposed the Versailles
treaty so bitterly have served notice that
they do not like the idea of the United
States getting involved in a four-power
agreement.
Ratio Not Yet Settled.
The well-known "5-5-3" ratio has not
yet reached a comfortable resting place.
Japan is reported to be still holding out
on its end of the agreement, particularly
in regard to its battleship Mitsu, which
it dislikes to do away with. Perhaps
the United States and Great Britain
will let her do this, and for their part,
keep two additional battleships each.
Next Year's Conference Planned.
In the meantime, President Harding
is said to be anxious that a similar con
ference be held next year, perhaps in
Tokio. This would be to dispose of
those matters not finally settled by the
present one.
Of immediate interest to Californians
is the fact that the Pacific fleet will lose
800 men by the new order passed by
Congress, which cuts down the person
nel of the navy 10,000. This seems to
indicate that the government is taking
disarmament seriously, and is beginning
now to make the road easier when the
big cut comes.
Two thousand men will be released
from the Atlantic fleet, and several bat
tleships will probably be junked Jjecause
of lack of crews to handle them.
Irish Parliament Meets.
Dail Eireann, the Irish Parliament,
meets today to determine whether or
not it will adopt the peace proposals
agreed to by representatives of Ireland
and England a week ago ( . At the same
time the Imperial Parliament of Eng
land will meet to consider the same
question. It seems certain that the treaty
will pass the English Parliament at once,
but how the Irish body will act is still
a mystery, especially while deValera re
mains opposed. It is rumored that Ul
ster has made concessions, so that trou
ble from that part is not as great as it
might be.
