# LIST OF PLAY CANDIDATES IS POSTED TODAY
## Davis Will Hold Preliminary and Second Tryouts For Play Tonight, Tomorrow 
### 
Second tryouts for Masquers' play
; will be held tonight from 7 to 1(1 o'clock
| and from .? to 6 tomorrow afternoon in
j the Assembly 11 all. Preliminary tryouts
I will also be held at these times for all
' those who have not yet tried out and
J still wish to do so.
The cast of characters includes not
only a number of parts for women, but
j there are also some exceptionally good
i opportunities for men dramatically in
| dined, and Coach Davis is particularly
| desirous of securing material for these
| parts. Special attention is being given
!to the matter of casting, and a wide
range of talent is therefore necessary.
The play was chosen by Masquers'
I Society because it offers a wide diver
-1 sity of characters, including sixteen
parts. It is a new play, one of the most
| popular of the present season, and Mas
quers was to secure the manu-
I script in advance of any theater or dra
matic organization in the west. It has
I been played in several eastern cities
! where it proved immensely successful,
and is soon to be presented in San Fran
I eisco.
The name of the play and the cast of
characters will be announced the first of
| next quarter. The production will be
given in slightly more than two weeks
'after the quarter starts.
