# 'CHARM SCHOOL' IS CHOSEN FOR MASQUERS' PLAY
## Cast Selected as Result of Tryouts Held Last Quarter To be Named Tomorrow 
### 
" The Charm School," Robert Milton's
stage adaptation of the Saturday Eve
ning Post story by Alice Duer Miller, is
the play selected by Masquers Society
for presentation on the evening of Fri
day, January 20, it was announced by
Coach Gordon Davis today. The entire
cast, selected as a result of tryouts held
last quarter, will be made known tomor
row.
The play is one of the newest of
the present season, its production by
Masquers will mark the first appearance
of the play in the West, as the society
was able to secure the manuscript in ad
vance of any theater or organization on
the Coast. It is soon to be given in San
Francisco.
The story has won instant popularity
both in story form, as it appeared in the
Saturday Evening Post, and on the
screen, Wallace Reid having played the
lead in the moving picture version. As
originally presented at the Thirty-ninth
Street Theater in New York the cast
included such Broadway favorites as
Margaret Dale, Sam Hardy, and Marie
Carroll.
The theme of the play is clean and
wholesome, its lines are infectious in
fun producing qualities, the characters
are all interesting and the central idea
is one out of the ordinary. The plot is
one which should appeal especially to
campus audiences. It centers about a
young man who unexpectedly inherits a
fashionable finishing' school for young
ladies. He starts in with many re
forms. The young ladies at the insti
tution begin investigating the nature of
the new owner and there follows a
series of good, wholesome fun* that is
irresistible. Throughout the comedy
there is a vivacious atmosphere of youth
and charm that should make it a de
lightful entertainment. The recipient of
tlie school believes that Greek, Latin,
and all other more or less decadent lan -
guages are not essential to the education
(if the modern young woman and that
she should rather be coached for the
best possible catches when she reaches
the catchable age. Sound as his theories
may be, the result is chaos and a series
of the most laughable complications
imaginable and a wind-up that leaves
everybody happy and thoroughly satis
tied.
Preparation of the sets for the play
has already begun and rehearsals will
start this evening. Gordon Davis ex
pects to make the work intensive, as the
play will be given in an unusually short
time.
