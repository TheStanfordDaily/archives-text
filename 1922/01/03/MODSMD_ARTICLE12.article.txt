# CARDINAL BASKETBALL TEAM FACES HARDEST SCHEDULE IN HISTORY
## Eighteen Games in Eleven Weeks, Including Oregon Trip, Will Give Van Gent's Five Plenty of Work 
### 
Stanford s varsity basketball five, with
eighteen games scheduled to be played
in less than two months, faces one of
the hardest seasons in the history of
the court game here. The schedule, now
practically complete, was drawn up In
the Graduate Manager's office, acting
through Basketball Manager Ernest
Wilson.
For the greater part of the eleven
week season the Cardinal quintet will
engage in at least two games a week.
On the northern invasion, which will
take place in the last part of January,
Stanford will play two-game series with
both Oregon and O. A. C. Van Gent
will take his charges north about Jan
uary 22 and will return a week later.
Santa Clara, emerging from a few
months' retirement from the intercol
legiate sport field, will provide the first
test for the varsity basket shooters on
January 11 in the Encina gymnasium.
I he tilt with the College of the Pa
cific on January 14 will he the lirst
played in the new basketball pavilion.
The Methodists from San Jose almost
stopped the works of the Cardinal ma
chine last year in one of the best played
games seen on the Stanford court, but

lost out in the last half. "Swede"
Righter, star forward on the Cardinal
quintets of 192(1 and 1921, and named
as All-Coast forward for 1921, is coach
ing the College of the Pacific cage team.
Stanford and California are to clash
in the first game of their annual series
on February 4 in the new pavilion. They
will not meet again until three weeks
later, when they play the second game
in the Oakland Auditorium.
Arrangements for three of the games
have not as yet been brought to a con
clusion. An attempt is being made to
bring the U. S. C. Trojans north on
February 14. Other tentative games are
with the University of Nevada and St.
Mary's.
Among those teams that will not
square off against the Cardinal varsity
this year is the University of Washing
ton quintet. The Sundodgers, with seven
veterans back in the fold ,are being
picked bv many followers of the cage
game as the "team to beat" in the race
for the Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship. The Seattle five will play four
games with the University of California.
