# He-Made College Traditions

### 
It is interesting; to note that Will Irwin, who is
out here now lecturing on the same topic as that of
his famous hook. "The Next War," which is the
necessity of avoiding any "next war," is celebrated
in some of the newspapers as a man who, along with
two or three others of his generation at Stanford,
made a good deal of the "traditions" of the uni
versity. This comment is contained not in the un
dergraduate publications but in the papers for
grown-up people, the general public who do not live
on the campus, and indicates, therefore, a belief that
the public will find such matters interesting—which
is a belief that is justified. People are interested
in college escapades, and "Bill" Irwin certainly did
5 that serve to
in in the item,
is probably the
.elative signifi
cance of the activities which years ago gave him a
reputation much admired by his undergraduate fel
lows and much deplored by the faculty of his time
when those activities are measured against those
which have occupied him since those more or less
irresponsible years." Most assuredly he would not
like to have his chief claim to public recognition
based on those activities. In other words, Will
Irwin has never lived in the past. Some people do.
and some people probably estimate Will Irwin more
by the measure of what he did as an undergraduate
to "make college tradition" than of what he has done
since then to influence the trend of the history of
civilization.
Irwin probably enjoys remembering some of his
college tradition-making escapades; it is doubtful if
a man with his abounding vitality and good sense
would ever reach the time when he could not spend
an enjoyable half-hour recalling them in company
with his boon companions in college, but it would
be hard to imagine him regarding them as achieve
ments to be recorded as highly important founda
tions for permanent fame.
I le made college tradition because he was living
then with all the exuberance of his originality; that
same originality and vitality has kept him going ever
since. Devising and executing college pranks, some
times spontaneous and sometimes carefully elab
orated. absorbed a good deal ot his attention then;
other matters have seemed more interesting to him
since he grew up to maturity, and he has thrown
himself into them with equal enthusiasm and with
results far more worth remembering.
Irwin has been given the title, "Ace of Corre
spondents," and the title has been earned, l ie is,
in the opinion of many whose judgment deserves
respect, today the best reporter in the world. He
is a man who has done his full share to hold the pro
fession of journalism to the high standards of re
sponsibility and professional ideals of public service
which it should maintain. This is because he has
thrown himself honestly into his reporting, written
earnestly what he actually saw and perceived. Thus
he produced the finest single piece of journalistic
writing of this generation, probably, in his "The City
That Was," written for the New York Sun after
the San Francisco fire, a newspaper story written
under the pressure of newspaper urgency that be
came at once a permanent contribution to literature.
One of the best pieces of reporting ever per formed
in this country was that done by Irwin when he
traveled over the United States and studied the news
papers of the country at first hand and then pub
lished his findings in Collier's Weekly. Ibis scries,
"The American Newspaper," written a decade ago,
is still in some wavs the best historv of American

journalism yet written, and in other respects is
unrivaled.
. During the (ireat War he wrote what he himself
saw in such sincerity of purpose and with such .skill
of execution that more than any other probably,
especially during the early stages, he aroused his
countrymen to a realization of the terrible facts.
Thus now, after the war, having seen the horrors
of international warfare and studied its causes, he
is telling his countrymen through the written and
the spoken word, what he knows in order that they
also may appreciate war and avoid war.
It may lie amusing to remember that W ill Irwin
made college tradition at Stanford, but those who
place undue emphasis on that bit of success expose
themselves to the suspicion that they stopped grow
ing along about the time that the Twentieth Century
was ushered in. Will Irwin did not. —Daily Palo
