We might make this the condolence number of Cab
bages, extending our sympathies toward, as it were,
those unfortunates who suffer the stroke of the invin
cible academic lethal weapon. We might also wring
handkerchiefs with the Golden Blue, but we ain't going
to. We'd rather chortle a couple of times and poke an
equal number of fun at 'em.
* * *
That is, poke fun at the latter. The victims of the
hatchet have been poked enoukh. But as far as that's
concerned, the former got a pig in a poke.
* * *
We might make this a welcome number for the festive
vegetable. We might welcome our recent and succu
lent additions to the latest class. We might hail with
acclaim all the Cal. transfers who have at last awaken
ed. We might,greet with the goodly glad hand all the
old boys returned to the fold. But we ain't going to.
The Committee on Studentship wants a crack at 'em
first.
* * *
Rumor has it that a lot of people are coming down
with the whooping cough. Sc is the Golden Grizzly, but
not with the whooping cough. It's terrible to have
someone kick the crutches from under you.
* * f
Speaking of hard luck, all the engineers are growling
yet because that hurricane occurred during vacation,
if: * *
To date only 9,999,888,606 New Year's resolutions
have been broken. The other one is pretty old.
si: * *
For the benefit of tnts uow, wo publish the following
information on kampus karakters in combination salad
style. The author just now invited us up to the room
for a snoot full, but we weren't able to walk that far
after a whiff of the guy's breath.
* * *
THE SNAKE
The snake, with slick and shining hair,
Attempts to make the co-eds stare.
With pleasant face he seeks to please—
He cultivates a grace and ease —
Knows what to do with hands and feet —
He has a manner, soft and sweet.
And now my son. you know the snake,
The rough will now our interest take.
* * *
THE ROUGH
His ink-bespattered corduroys
To clean his pen, the rough employs.
Unshaven face and battered hat,
What cares the rough for such as that?
The C. E. Corner, where be stays, ,
The co-eds shun, on windy days.
With pipe or homemade cigarette,
What cares the rough for etiquette?
* * »
MORAL:
Two different men have met our view.
The snake and rough may seem to you
As far apart as East and West.
But hark, my son. When shaved and dressed,
With hair that shines with bandoline,
The Rough stands forth, the Snake supreme.
* * #
The following is LABELED comedy. We reserve
judgment.
SCENE: Engineering Corner.
A rough approaches, who is one of the institutions of
the corner. He is sliclced-up in his "great savings in
suits, this week only."
Roughs on Corner (CHORUS) My Gawd. Lookit
Devans. All dressed up in his best clothes.
Rough number one. Queener.
All roughs. (Chorus) Snake. Doormat.
Rough number two. Hay, Devans. What the —have
you done —turned Queener?
Devans : —Hell, no. I tore my other pants.
(Curtain).
(Cries of "Awful, awful.")

From the Cornell Sun's Berry Patch
Father Love
I stared at his hands so cold and blue,
I gazed at his pale small face,
I wondered if the angels, too.
Could rest with him in place.
I thought of his noise and wild alarm
As he ran the livelong day,
So fearless of all kinds of harm
Which ever came liis way.
F clasp li is form now close to mine.
No moi'e can he repeat—
The music of his voice so fine
Can ne'er my poor ears greet.
() cruel fate! O, can it be
That 1 will ne'er again
Give my blessings sweet to thee,
My Baby, Baby—Ben!

We might make this the condolence number of Cab
bages, extending our sympathies toward, as it were,
those unfortunates who suffer the stroke of the invin
cible academic lethal weapon. We might also wring
handkerchiefs with the Golden Blue, but we ain't going
to. We'd rather chortle a couple of times and poke an
equal number of fun at 'em.
* * *
That is, poke fun at the latter. The victims of the
hatchet have been poked enoukh. But as far as that's
concerned, the former got a pig in a poke.
* * *
We might make this a welcome number for the festive
vegetable. We might welcome our recent and succu
lent additions to the latest class. We might hail with
acclaim all the Cal. transfers who have at last awaken
ed. We might,greet with the goodly glad hand all the
old boys returned to the fold. But we ain't going to.
The Committee on Studentship wants a crack at 'em
first.

Rumor has it that a lot of people are coming down
with the whooping cough. Sc is the Golden Grizzly, but
not with the whooping cough. It's terrible to have
someone kick the crutches from under you.

Speaking of hard luck, all the engineers are growling
yet because that hurricane occurred during vacation,
if: * *
To date only 9,999,888,606 New Year's resolutions
have been broken. The other one is pretty old.

For the benefit of tnts uow, wo publish the following

for a snoot full, but we weren't able to walk that far

THE SNAKE
The snake, with slick and shining hair,
Attempts to make the co-eds stare.
With pleasant face he seeks to please—
He cultivates a grace and ease —
Knows what to do with hands and feet —
He has a manner, soft and sweet.
And now my son. you know the snake,
The rough will now our interest take.
* * *
THE ROUGH
His ink-bespattered corduroys
To clean his pen, the rough employs.
Unshaven face and battered hat,
What cares the rough for such as that?
The C. E. Corner, where be stays, ,
The co-eds shun, on windy days.
With pipe or homemade cigarette,
What cares the rough for etiquette?
* * »
MORAL:
Two different men have met our view.
The snake and rough may seem to you
As far apart as East and West.
But hark, my son. When shaved and dressed,
With hair that shines with bandoline,
The Rough stands forth, the Snake supreme.

The following is LABELED comedy. We reserve
judgment.
SCENE: Engineering Corner.
A rough approaches, who is one of the institutions of
the corner. He is sliclced-up in his "great savings in
suits, this week only."
Roughs on Corner (CHORUS) My Gawd. Lookit
Devans. All dressed up in his best clothes.
Rough number one. Queener.
All roughs. (Chorus) Snake. Doormat.
Rough number two. Hay, Devans. What the —have

Father Love
I stared at his hands so cold and blue,
I gazed at his pale small face,
I wondered if the angels, too.
Could rest with him in place.
I thought of his noise and wild alarm
As he ran the livelong day,
So fearless of all kinds of harm
Which ever came liis way.
F clasp li is form now close to mine.
No moi'e can he repeat—
The music of his voice so fine
Can ne'er my poor ears greet.
() cruel fate! O, can it be
That 1 will ne'er again
Give my blessings sweet to thee,
My Baby, Baby—Ben!
