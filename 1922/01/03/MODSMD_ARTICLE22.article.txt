Japan entered the Conference by gen

Were the Conference to close today the
Japanese position among the great pow
ers would be greatly improved by their
participation. I' - ranee, on the other
hand, entered the Conference, with the
very greatest popular backing. Her
course lias run in the other direction
ever since Premier Briand addressed
the full session on the matter of land
armaments. The Franch statement of
December 19th on the matter of the
naval ratio brought the Conference to
a deadlock, and subsequent statements
of* the French delegation, although they
contained slight recessions from the
original demands, yet have not served to
decrease the feeling of irritation and in
some cases of open hostility. The
French now occupy the least favorable
position.
The announcement of the alleged
agreement between France and Japan
dated September 2, 1921, and purporting
to deal with the problems of the Con
ference is a vivid illustration of the
difficulties at Washington, so far hidden
for the most part from the public. There
are seven different Russian delegations
as well as representatives from such un
recognized states as Korea, India, and
South China, all and each of whom
would have much to gain from the en
largement of the Conference agenda
which would probably follow upon a
serious deadlock as among the great
powers.
