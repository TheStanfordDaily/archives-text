Stanford's varsity swimming tes
will be strengthened by the additi
of several swimmers who have d
j eloped during the fall quarter, urn
the tutelage of Ernst Brandsten.
Hi YVooster, '22, is the most promis
ing man in the group which Brand
sten has been grooming for varsity
competition. He is training for the
220-yard free style and lias cut fifteen
seconds off his time in approximately
j two weeks. Wooster swam the dis
: tance Monday in two minutes and tiftv j
1 seconds, without competition. His j
j powerful, easy stroke, coupled with a i
| great power of endurance, gives him [
: almost unlimited possibilities.
J. W. Hawley, '22, is another addi
tion to the ranks of the star perform
ers at the Encina Pool. He has been
doing 68 feet consistently in plunge
for distance. Hawley is comparative i
ly inexperienced as a diver, and has |
improved rapidly in the past two
j months. Brandsten expects him to I
shatter the Pacific Coast intercollegi- !
ate record of 71 feet, which has stood
I for five years.
There is no lack of material in the
j 220 free style. M. C. Morsead, '22, has |
I been swimming the event in fast time. 1
He formerly competed for the Uni- j
j versity of California. Greppin, who i
j has been the mainstay of the varsity,
is hard at work developing endurance,
i When right, he is a hard man to beat, i
