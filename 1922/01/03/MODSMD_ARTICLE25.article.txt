# LOS ANGELES NEW
## 
### 
dreds of thousands of dollars are be
ing spent in securing grounds and in
I erecting the stadiums.
Southern California will soon have
another huge athletic field and stadi
um in addition to the one used for
the New Year's game at Pasadena. The
new stadium will be at Exposition
J Park, in Los Angeles, and will seat
I from 60,000 to 70.000 people. It is re
ported that the main idea behind this
plan is to pave the way for bringing
the Olympic Games to Los Angeles in
1928, or, if possible, in 1924. The
Olympic Games for 1924 were to be
held in Paris, but the French have
been unable to get under way in build
| ing a suitable place, and the games
I may be held elsewhere in 1924.
An eleventh hour gift has enabled
! Columbia University to obtain the
i $700,000 Dyehman tract on upper
! Broadway, in New York, for athletic
| purposes, just before the option ex
| pired. A huge stadium and several
1 athletic fields will be constructed.
The University of Detroit has jump
i ed into (he limelight by the announce
ment that they will construct an ath
letic stadium with a seating capacity of
| an athletic stadium to hold 70,00>0.
