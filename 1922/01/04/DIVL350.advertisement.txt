All our skill, facilities, and lifelong knowledge of
the finest tobaccos are concentrated on this one
cigarette—CAMEL.
Into this ONE BRAND, we put the utmost qual
ity. Nothing is too good for Camels. They are as
good as it's possible to make a cigarette.
Camel QUALITY is always maintained at the
same high, exclusive standard. You can always
I depend on the same mellow-mild refreshing smooth^
Iness —the taste and rich flavor of choicest tobaccos
—and entire freedom from cigaretty aftertaste.
And remember this! Camels come in one size
package onty—2o cigarettes—just the right size to
make the greatest saving in production and packing.
This saving goes straight into Camel Quality. That's
I one reason why you can get Camel Quality at so
moderate a price.
Here's another. We put no useless frills on the |j
Camel package. No "extra wrappers!" Nothing
just for show!
Such things do not improve the smoke any more
| than premiums or coupons. And their added cost
must go onto the price or come out of the quality.
One thing—and one only—is responsible for
Camels great and growing popularity— i!
