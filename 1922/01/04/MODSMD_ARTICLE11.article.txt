### 
Will Irwin, '99, journalist and lec
turer, addressed Encina Club, uf which
lie was a member while in college, and
gave an informal talk to Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalistic fraternity,
at the home of Professor Everett W.
Smith last night during a short visit to
the campus. Charles Is. Field, '95, editor
of the Sunset, accompanied Irwin and
gave a short talk at Encina Club.
Both Irwin and Field were editors of
the Daily Palo Alto during their col
lege careers and took active parts in
other campus journalism and in play
writing. Irwin is now on a lecture tour
of the Pacific Coast, speaking on "The
Trade of Writing" and "The Next
War," the subject of his latest book.
He will lecture in San Francisco to
morrow night.
While on the campus, both Irwin and
Field visited their old rooms and told of
many of their experiences while in col
lege. During the discussion at Profes
sor Smith's home, Irwin talked about
his first days on the New York Sun and
the circumstances surrounding the writ
ing of "The City That Was." For eight
days after the San Francisco lire, he
said, he wrote from eight to fourteen
newspaper columns a day from tele
graphic scraps. The Sun was not a
member of the Associated Press, the
only press bureau in New York to re
ceive the telegraphic news because of
an oversight by the filing San Francisco
correspondent.
Irwin expects to leave for Russia soon
after the completion of his lecture tour,
to study and write of conditions there.
