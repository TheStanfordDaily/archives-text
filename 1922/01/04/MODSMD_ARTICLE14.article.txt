# MOST CAGE MEN BACK FOR FIRST PRACTICE
## Captain Davies Coaches First Practice of Year; Van Gent at Conference for Catches 
### 
Most of the lirs; string candidates for
positions on the varsity basketball quin-
U't appeared on the Encina gym floor
yesterday afternoon and went through
a short work-out. Captain Davies put
the players through their paces in the
absence of Coach Gene Van Gent.
\ an Gent attended the annual meet
ing of the .National Association of Foot
ball Coaches in New York in the Christ
mas holidays. He is expected on the
campus today and will start immediately
on the task of putting a formidable live
on the uoor for the first game with
Santa Clara on January 11.
esterday's work-out consisted for
the most part of basket shooting and
passing, with the majority of the men
taking it easy. A few have been plav
ing basketball during the holidays and
are in good condition.
Davies appears to he but little affected
by the appendicitis operation which lie
underwent last quarter. The little for
ward was found in all parts of the
court, making hard shots- with little
effort. He looks to be in mid-seasort
form.
"I.efty Rogers, regarded by many as
tlie one who will be Davies' running
mate at the forward position, is a mem
ber of the Stanford'rugby team which
invaded British Columbia during the
holidays. Rogers, who alternated with
Davies in most of the games last year,
appeared to good advantage in the pre
liminary work-outs held at the end of
last quarter under the direction of Van
Gent. He will probably report for bas
ketball practice again Friday afternoon.
I lie Santa Clara live, under the tute
lage of Joe (Sneeze) Aurreoeocchea,
on Mission quintets of live years
ago, is making trouble for all comers.
I lie Missionites took advantage of the
holidays and toured southern California,
engaging in live contests.
Los Angeles Athletic Club fell a vic
tim to tlie Santa Clara team in the first
game, but the clubmen turned the tables
on the Missionites in a return match.
Santa Clara is directing all her ef
forts toward winning the contest from
the Cardinals on January 11. They will
be going at top speed and the Stanford
machine will just be getting under way.
Van Gent realizes that Santa Clara is
no "set-up," and will drive his charges
hard to have them fully prepared when
they open the season.

Los Angeles Athletic Club fell a vic
tim to tlie Santa Clara team in the first
game, but the clubmen turned the tables
on the Missionites in a return match.
Santa Clara is directing all her ef
forts toward winning the contest from
the Cardinals on January 11. They will
be going at top speed and the Stanford
machine will just be getting under way.
Van Gent realizes that Santa Clara is
no "set-up," and will drive his charges
hard to have them fully prepared when
they open the season.
