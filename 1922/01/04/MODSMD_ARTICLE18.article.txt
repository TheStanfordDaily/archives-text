# RESULTS OF RECENT DRIVES ANNOUNCED BY SERVICE BOARD
## 
### 
Results of the European Student Fund
drive which was launched on the campus
December 7th show a total of $535 in
cash raised, and an additional amount of
$55 in pledges yet to be paid. Due to
the fact that the drive came almost di
| rectly after the annual Red Cross roll
call the sum is only a fourth of the
amount raised by the students during
j a similar drive last year. The Women's
Service Board was in charge of the
campaign for funds.
The Board also reports that the total
amount raised in Red Cross member
ships during the Christmas Roll Call
was $1139.02, which is approximately the
same as was raised among the residents
of Palo Alto, during the same roll call.
