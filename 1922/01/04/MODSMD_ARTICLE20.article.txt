# ALPHA DELTA PHI, DELTA KAPPA EPSILON AND BETA THETA PI CHANGE RUSHING
## President Wilbur Approves of More Lengthy Rushing Season and Signs New Proposal of Three Fraternities 
### 
"I believe that the new constitution
as drawn up by representatives of the
Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
and Beta 1 heta Pi houses is a step in
the direction in which fraternities should
ultimately go, and is in accordance witli
an agreement made with me by the In
terfraternity Conference in 1919," said
President Wilbur in ratifying the con
stitution and by-laws as drawn up by
the above named houses this morning.
The new constitution comes as a re
sult of the attempt on the> part of the
three houses to draw up a constitution
which will meet the points of dissension
arising in connection with fraternity
rushing. The principal differences
which are provided in the new constitu
tion are as follows: Rushing shall ex
tend over a period of one quarter, no
formal rushing parties shall be given,

and men being rushed shall ho out of the
fraternity houses by 2 o'clock in the
afternoon and 8 o clock in the evening.
The objects of the Fraternity Council
as set forth in Article 1, Section 1 of
the new constitution are as follows;
(a) To create from the selection of
new members for the individual fra
ternities, an orderly, dignified process,
based upon principles of friendship and
true worth, such as will insure a high
standard of membership throughout the
fraternities at Stanford, (b) To make
the process as simple and inexpensive as
possible, and to remove all influences
which tend to be a drain upon the re
sources of the parties concerned, (c) To
promote a greater spirit of harmony
between the various individual fraterni
ties, and between the fraternity group as
a whole and the faculty of the univer
sity.
Jt seems to me that the new constitu
tion is a step toward the type of rushing
which permits the freshman to become
well established in the university, before
he makes a decision as to what lie wishes
to do, and this will make it more safe
for the incoming student to make his de
cision." said B. C. Wohlford, '18. the
representative from the Delta Kappa
hpsilon house. "The penalties for in
fraction of any rules as provided in the
by-laws is the forfeiture of the privilege
of bidding during the quarter in which
the violation occurs, and T believe that
this is a step forward."
1 hat the whole object of the new
constitution is to reach the ultimate so
lution of the fraternity problem in an
amicable way is the opinion of H. H.
Darling, '21, Alpha Delta Phi's repre
sentative.
"1 do not believe that we are reaching
an absolute and final decision on the
subject, but I do believe that we are
making a step to better the existing con
ditions." said T. .1. Hamlyn, '21. who
represents Beta Theta Pi-. "Suggestions
such as a two-quarter rushing season
will be received with favor and given
the most careful consideration."
Although the constitution has not been
ratified by the three houses it is ex
pected that ratification will come very
*oon as the new plan meets with the
approval of representatives from each
of the houses.

and men being rushed shall ho out of the
fraternity houses by 2 o'clock in the
afternoon and 8 o clock in the evening.
The objects of the Fraternity Council
as set forth in Article 1, Section 1 of
the new constitution are as follows;
(a) To create from the selection of
new members for the individual fra
ternities, an orderly, dignified process,
based upon principles of friendship and
true worth, such as will insure a high
standard of membership throughout the
fraternities at Stanford, (b) To make
the process as simple and inexpensive as
possible, and to remove all influences
which tend to be a drain upon the re
sources of the parties concerned, (c) To
promote a greater spirit of harmony
between the various individual fraterni
ties, and between the fraternity group as
a whole and the faculty of the univer
sity.
Jt seems to me that the new constitu
tion is a step toward the type of rushing
which permits the freshman to become
well established in the university, before
he makes a decision as to what lie wishes
to do, and this will make it more safe
for the incoming student to make his de
cision." said B. C. Wohlford, '18. the
representative from the Delta Kappa
hpsilon house. "The penalties for in
fraction of any rules as provided in the
by-laws is the forfeiture of the privilege
of bidding during the quarter in which
the violation occurs, and T believe that
this is a step forward."
1 hat the whole object of the new
constitution is to reach the ultimate so
lution of the fraternity problem in an
amicable way is the opinion of H. H.
Darling, '21, Alpha Delta Phi's repre
sentative.
"1 do not believe that we are reaching
an absolute and final decision on the
subject, but I do believe that we are
making a step to better the existing con
ditions." said T. .1. Hamlyn, '21. who
represents Beta Theta Pi-. "Suggestions
such as a two-quarter rushing season
will be received with favor and given
the most careful consideration."
Although the constitution has not been
ratified by the three houses it is ex
pected that ratification will come very
*oon as the new plan meets with the
approval of representatives from each
of the houses.
"I believe that the new constitution
as drawn up by representatives of the
Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
and Beta 1 heta Pi houses is a step in
the direction in which fraternities should
ultimately go, and is in accordance witli
an agreement made with me by the In
terfraternity Conference in 1919," said
President Wilbur in ratifying the con
stitution and by-laws as drawn up by
the above named houses this morning.
The new constitution comes as a re
sult of the attempt on the> part of the
three houses to draw up a constitution
which will meet the points of dissension
arising in connection with fraternity
rushing. The principal differences
which are provided in the new constitu
tion are as follows: Rushing shall ex
tend over a period of one quarter, no
formal rushing parties shall be given,

and men being rushed shall ho out of the
fraternity houses by 2 o'clock in the
afternoon and 8 o clock in the evening.
