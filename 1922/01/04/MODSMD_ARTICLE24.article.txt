# Two Rushing Contracts
## 
### 
Eighteen fraternities are now engaged in rushing
under the new contract embodied in the constitution
of the Inter fraternity Conference adopted at the close
of the autumn quarter. This contract provides for
a concentrated rushing period of thirteen days, after
â– Which pledging will take place. Incoming men have
thirteen days to decide where they will live during
the four years they will he in the University. The
necessity for a decision after thirteen days, coupled
with the greater task of becoming settled in the ways
of Stanford University is almost certain to prove
to be too large a task for the average entering stu
dent.
Engagements at the various houses will be regu
lated by a card system, and the card of each rushee
is open to inspection by any fraternity. Under this
system a much-sought-after student will have but
one or two dates with a fraternity. Following these
visits he will be asked to select the group with which
he will live during the time he is here. Obviously
this is unfair to the entering man and will tend to
weaken the fraternities in the long run.
There is one bright thing about the fraternity sit
uation at present. Three fraternities have drawn
up a constitution which will govern their actions dur
ing the coming quarter, and it has been approved by
President Wilbur. Under the provisions of this con
tract there will be no formal rushing. There are to
be 110 dances, parties, or any of the functions that
accompany formal rushing. Entering men will be
invited to these fraternities during the entire quar
ter with the strict proviso that they be out of the
houses by 2 o'clock in the afternoon and 8 o'clock in
the evening. Pledging will be done on the Sun
day before final examinations, and the week preced
ing this date will constitute a closed period, during
which rushing will be banned.
This is a step in the right direction. While the
ideal plan would ban rushing during the entire
fiscal year, this radical change can not be made at
once. If the idea of informal rushing is carried out
the men will meet under ordinary circumstances
without the hubbub and excitement that accompanies
concentrated rushing. After almost a quarter of this
type of rushing the entering student will know
whether or not he wants to join a fraternity, and
which one he wants to affiliate with if he does.
There probably will be 110 regrets on either side.
tr The three fraternities are pursuing the right
course, and their stand under present conditions is a
good one.
