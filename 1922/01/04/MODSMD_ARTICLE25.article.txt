# Enter Basketball

With the opening of another quarter a new ath
letic season is ushered in. Football for the 1 (, 21-
1922 season ended with the New Year, and the col
lege athlete, and Mr. Ordinary Student as well, turn
to the winter pastime, basketball.
For the past two seasons Stanford has had the
champion cage team of the Pacific Coast Conference.
Despite the fact that last year Stanford and Califor
nia both finished with the same percentage in the final
standing of the conference, the Cardinal five was
ajdudged the better team because of its two vic
tories over the Bear in the annual three-game series.
Spaulding's Annual Basketball Guide publishes Stan
ford as the strongest team on the Pacific Coast.
This year, however, it is going to be difficult to
repeat the successes of the last two seasons. Three
of the members of last year's quintet are 110 longer
in Stanford, and it will be necessary for Coach Gene
Van Gent to rebuild the team with but two veterans
as a nucleus. Practice workouts before the holidays
showed that the material for another winner is here,

and indications point to a very successful basketball
season.
The team that can negotiate the schedule mapped
out for the Stanford basketball squad will have to be
a very strong one. Four hard games have been
scheduled for the opening two weeks of the season,
and in the third week the Cardinal quintet will in
vade the northland to play four games in five days
against the Oregon universities. Returning home,
they will rest up for live days before encountering
California in the first game of the annual series.
Between the first and second contest with the Bruins
several other university teams will be imported to
provide competition. Sixteen games will be played
by Van Gent's squad.
It looks like a difficult season ahead, but Stanford
teams like it difficult, and from present indications
the basketball team will go far toward the champion
ship.
