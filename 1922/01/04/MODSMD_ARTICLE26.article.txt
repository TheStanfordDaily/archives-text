Our idea of a good New Year's resolution is to de
termine not to make any. It's the only one we ever
heard of that was kept. They're about as perishable
as the proverbial snow sphere.
* *
Our brush league friend, ye ed. has expressed his
sentiments along these lines, in the following lines.
Read by spasms: >
* * *
PROLOGUE
Now that Christmas cheer is over
And the old year's of the past
And the frost is on the pumpkin
And the critic stands eghast,
I,et us give a merrie yodel.
Let us lilt a loud refrain,
Of the New Year's resolutions
That are cropping out again.
** * \
SONG
There's the snake who's quit his queening,
There's the rough who's quit his quid.
There's the crip who's quit his cramming,
And the Soph who's quit his lid.
There's the dolt who's dropped his dancing.
There's the dunce who's dropped his dink,
Such resolutions all will last
A long time. . . we don't think.
i|S * *
EPILOGUE -
The howls of the reformer.
The pleadings of the throng.
Won't help a resolution,
So doggone far along;
If the multitude seeks action,
If the purist squad would gain,
They might do well to harken.
To this poet's howl of pain.
T * * »
AFTERTHOUGHT
Don't throw your cigarettes away.
Don't toss the plug aside.
Don't drop your bottle on the bricks,
But long and loud deride
The guy who makes a promise
And throws it in the heap;
Who makes a resolution. \
The kind that he won't keep.
* * *
"?v P. S.
* So rally round the beerkeg. boys
T ? And drink the darn thing dry,
T And smoke and chew and swear right on.
And watch the hours roll by.
But if you're a reformer.
And our creed you won't accept.
Then try to practice what you preach
And see your vows are kept.
• * •
These prohibitionists will be pinching the proverbial
"bull in the china shop" pretty soon for being in his
cups.
♦ * *
Since that Pasadena game we all ought to declare
open season on the festive alibi hound. They'll be
thicker than North Pole molasses in a freshman's head.
* * *
The Golden Brewin' got a snoot-full of Native Son
hide bui;ner and scared the kids on the Athletic Coast
with his growls last year, but a fervently applied anti
dote of W-J Sauce with a goalpost background, seems to
have reduced the swelling.
* # «.
It has been left for an obscure artist to discover that
Cardinal is the complementary color of the Gold and
Blue combination which is supposed to make green.
All the compliments they get from now on will be sea
soned with appropriate remarks.
* » *
The Passing Show
The premiere of that extravagant extravaganza,
"Writers' Cramp." impressed us deeply, not to say
heavily. The force of the gigantic struggle crushed our
emotions. Booked as a three-hour performance with a
new line every minute, it stood up to all expectations.
Raving beauties met the eye on every hand. Each
scene gave the impression of vast spaces being filled
with dancing figures. No expense was spared.
Taken as a whole, the plot was very deep. Taken
apart, it was a conflict from start to finish. The part
ing scene at the window was particularly touching. Al
together, it may be said without hesitation that every
act of the play was work requiring a genius.

Method of Picking a Course
(As expended by Noah Lott, ex-'2l, a rising young
ditch-digger)- First look in back of schedule. Find list
marked "Finals Not Held in These Courses." Then cross
off all of these falling in first and last columns of
schedule. Cross off all in syllabus free list. Choose your
course from those remaining. Take course to major
prof. Buy ticket home.

Let us lilt a loud refrain,
Of the New Year's resolutions
That are cropping out again.
** * \
SONG
There's the snake who's quit his queening,
There's the rough who's quit his quid.
There's the crip who's quit his cramming,
And the Soph who's quit his lid.
There's the dolt who's dropped his dancing.
There's the dunce who's dropped his dink,
Such resolutions all will last
A long time. . . we don't think.
i|S * *
EPILOGUE -
The howls of the reformer.
The pleadings of the throng.
Won't help a resolution,
So doggone far along;
If the multitude seeks action,
If the purist squad would gain,
They might do well to harken.
To this poet's howl of pain.
T * * »
AFTERTHOUGHT
Don't throw your cigarettes away.
Don't toss the plug aside.
Don't drop your bottle on the bricks,
But long and loud deride
The guy who makes a promise
And throws it in the heap;
Who makes a resolution. \
The kind that he won't keep.
* * *
"?v P. S.
* So rally round the beerkeg. boys
T ? And drink the darn thing dry,
T And smoke and chew and swear right on.
And watch the hours roll by.
But if you're a reformer.
And our creed you won't accept.
Then try to practice what you preach
And see your vows are kept.

The Passing Show
The premiere of that extravagant extravaganza,
"Writers' Cramp." impressed us deeply, not to say
heavily. The force of the gigantic struggle crushed our
emotions. Booked as a three-hour performance with a
new line every minute, it stood up to all expectations.
Raving beauties met the eye on every hand. Each
scene gave the impression of vast spaces being filled
with dancing figures. No expense was spared.
Taken as a whole, the plot was very deep. Taken
apart, it was a conflict from start to finish. The part
ing scene at the window was particularly touching. Al
together, it may be said without hesitation that every
act of the play was work requiring a genius.
