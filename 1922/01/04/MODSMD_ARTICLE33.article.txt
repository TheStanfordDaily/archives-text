# VARSITY SWIMMING SQUAD HANDICAPPED FOR SPRING WORK
## 
### 
Cold weather keeps the swimming
team out of the water for the most
part at the outset of this quarter.
Coach Brandsten, however, is planning
to put his charges to work again soon
and will begin forming his team to
compete in the spring Intercollegiate
meet, held here in the early part of the
spring quarter. This is the lirst year
that a general intercollegiate meet
will be held and considerable interest
is centered in the sport as a result. ;
Swimming is taking on a more im-1
portant aspect as a sport every day j
among the colleges and in many of the
universities of the East has been rated
as a major sport on account of the all
around benefit that a man gets out of
the exercise.
The end of the last quarter put sev
eral of the stars of the line-up of last
year out of the running when they
failed to garner enough grade-points
and this will leave the mermen con
siderably weakened. The casualties
are mostly among the members of the
varsity and will make it hard for the
aggregation to show the class that it
did last quarter in the meets in San
Francisco but there are men left in
the line-up who will be sure of annex
ing points in coming meets.
With yesterday's registration, men
from San Francisco were expected to
enter who have been the main strength
of Lowell High School's team in the
past year and these will add consider
ably to the chances that the babe
squad will have in the scheduled meet
for the coming season.
The disqualification of the members
of the varsity squad has upset the dope i
to such an extent that the meets to
be held have not been absolutely
settled as yet. There will be likely
an interclass meet at an early date
to bring out the customary crop of
new material and from this turnout
may be culled some good men who
have not hitherto showed up.
With the filling of the lake a good
chance for the distance men to prac
tice is coming and warm weather will
soon see the swimmers out for the
spring sport there.
