"Most of the senior pictures have
been taken already, hut some of the '22
class who have not visited the Franklin
studio, ahout one-third, will have to be
taken care of during January." Quad
Editor Wylie Kilpatrick said today.
I here will he no closing date announced
for a couple of weeks, hut about the
last of January Kilpatrick expects to
(ill the section.
As this is the first senior class to have
their pictures in the Quad, the editors
are especially anxious to have a com
plete section. The Franklin studio, on
the Circle, has asked that as many as
possible come to be photographed this
week in order to relieve the congestion
which will probably hold up the last
weeks.
