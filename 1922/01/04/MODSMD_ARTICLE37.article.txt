## 
### 
i The Chinese have asked Arthur Bal
four and Secretary Hughes to arbi
trate their difficulty with Japan over
Shantung. At present a deadlock ex
ists between them and their communi
cation on the subject has been dis
continued, presumably that the Japa
nese delegation might obtain further j
instructions from home.
