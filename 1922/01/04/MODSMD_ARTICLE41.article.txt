# STANFORD-BARBS OPEN SECOND HALF OF SOCCER LEAGUE
## 
### 
Stanford starts the second half of the
j soccer schedule in the University and
I Club Soccer League when the Cardinal
I eleven goes up against the Barbarian
j team on Saturday, January 21. This
j allows the soccerites plenty of chance to
get into condition, and Coach Harry
Maloney has announced his intention of
putting the team through extensive
work-outs.
The Cardinals lost few if any men
last quarter, and the prospects for the
future are very good. The Olympic
Club is running the Stanford team a
tight race, and it will take all of the
strength of the Cardinal squad to du
plicate the records of the last few
years. Some of the men have bepn
I practicing during vacation, and several
! men who were not eligible last quarter
have signified that they will once more
| lie ready for competition.
