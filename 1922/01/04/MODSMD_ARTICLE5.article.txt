# FROGS AND QUEENERS REJOICE AS LAGUNITA BEATS FORMER RECORD
## 
### 
Lagunita is beating the record of last
year in tilling if it keeps up the way the
water has been rising for the past few
days. Last season was considered a wet
one when the lake had water in it before
the end of the winter quarter, but now
the frogs are chortling with joy at see
ing their old haunt till so early in the
season. The climate is too frigid about
the vicinity of Lagunita jo permit much
indulgence in the art "of aquatics, but
the denizens of the basin look for better
times soon.
