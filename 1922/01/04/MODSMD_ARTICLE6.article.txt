# WINTER ENROLLMENT ABOVE LAST YEAR'S
## Slight Decrease From Autumn Quarter Registration; Less New Students Than in 1921 
### 
Registration for this winter quauter
shows an increase of 73 over that of
the winter quarter last year, according
to figures issued by the registrar's office
today, i lie number of new students en
tering the university for the winter
quarter, however, has dropped i\om 124
(1921) to 96 (. 1922).
1 lie total registration comes to 2229.
This time a year ago 21/6 students en
rolled. /
J he men outnumbe/the women among
the new students \(y nearly 2 to 1.
Sixty-two of the pew students are men
and 34 are women. At this time last
year the proportion of men to women
was even greater â€”85 to 39.
The present total enrollment figure is
expected to increase within the next few
days, as there are many old students
that have not yet enrolled; so the in
crease over last year's total will soon be
greater than it is at present.
In line with the general tendency of
winter quarters to be slightly lower in
total registration than autumn quarters,
the present one is no exception. The
enrollment for this quarter is 270 less
than last quarter's enrollment.
