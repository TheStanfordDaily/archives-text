# San Francisco Orchestra Will Give Last Symphony Concert Tuesday Evening
## 
### 
The second and last concert of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
will be given on next Tuesday evening
in the Assembly Hall. This will mark
the final appearance of Alfred Hertz
and his eighty-five artists during the
present musical season.
For this concert, Alfred Hertz will
give one of his "popular" programs,
similar to the "pop" concert series he
has been giving in San Francisco every
week. The numbers will all be of a
light nature.
