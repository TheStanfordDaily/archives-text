PILAR INCLINE
CITY OK BAHI A, BRAZIL
ViAHtA is divided into an Upper and
-*-* a Lower City. One section is on the
top of a cliff—the other extends bet ween the
foot of the cliff and the waterfront.
Four Otis Electric Elevators in two large
vertical towers and the Otis Incline Railway
pictured here, carry the people and freight
up and down the cliff. The Incline Railway
is huilt at an angle of 40 degrees; there are
two cars working alternately, each with a
capacity of 20 people and 1500 pounds
freight and the trip is made in 90 seconds.
Otis engineering has successfully linked these
two parts of Bahia. This achievement, big
as it is, is but one significant detail of the
world-wide service given by Otis.
Most of the famous structures of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators.
