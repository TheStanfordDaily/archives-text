# Athletic Board Defies Apostles Of Superstition
## 
### 
Is Friday the thirteenth an unlucky j
day? "Yes," say the superstitious and i
weak-minded, "nothing but ill can hap
pen on that fatal day."
"Nay! not so!" protests the Board of!
Athletic Control, and in open defiance I
of the fortune-teller and the sorceress, it!
sends forth the glad tiding that on l-'ri
day, January 13, the new basketball pa- !
vilion will he opened with one of the
largest dances that the campus lias ever I
seen.
And snakes. Unfurl your ears that j
you may hear â€”your meagre bankrolls
are safe. "Come one and all," says the
fioard.
Incorrigible Roughs! Do not think I
that it is to he a jolly-up. On the con-1
trary, it is to l>e a program dance with |
magnificently-groomed men, gorgeously-1
gowned women, punch, and everything. I
Paul H. Davis, and his two assistants.
Carey Bailard and Jim Clark, propose to
have the best orchestra that can be se
lected from campus talent. There will
lie ten pieces: Ambrose Whitmer and
Mai ion Grinstead, pianos; Ted Mertz,
Norman Nathanson, and Lewis Alabas-!
tor, saxophones; A1 Carrey, drum; Jim j
Kelly, cornet; Luke Jackson, trombone;
Donald Hutton, violin; Charles Way
land, banjo.
11" such an orchestra would be
effective on the ordinary dance floor, it
will lie thrice so on the spring floor of
the pavilion. This floor is constructed
in such a way that no part of it rests on
a solid contact. Polished to glassy
smoothness, 175 feet by 110 feet of un
broken surface, it will make the heart
of every campus snake wriggle with joy.
