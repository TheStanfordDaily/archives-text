# VAN GENT BACK FROM TRIP EAST
## 
### 
C. E. (Gene) Van Gent, varsity foot j
ball and basketball coach, returned to I
the campus yesterday from New York,}
where he represented Stanford at the
annual meeting of the National Associa
tion of Football Coaches. He also at
tended the gathering of the National
Collegiate Association, at which Dr. A.
D. Browne, director of the department
of physical education, was present.
Van Gent was impressed by the
amount of interest shown at the football
coaches' meeting. "Never before have!
I seen so large a gathering of the asso
ciation, ' he said, "or so much of en- j
thusiasm displayed. Almost everybody '
of any importance connected with foot- j
ball instruction was there."
Coaches from every section of the •
country were in attendance, and from
all of them came the opinion that tlie*
great American sport had never enjoyed
a more successful year.
The coaches as a body expressed their
disapproval of professional football, ac
cording to Van Gent. All attempts of j'
professional football to gain a foothold j
in the country will be strongly resisted i
bv the coaches, both individually and as ■
a body. They oppose it on the ground I
tllat professional football would severely J
injure popular interest in the amateur,
sport.
One measure advocated by the mentors I
was not to employ any official for ama- |
tour games who is in any way con-1
nected with professional football.
Van Gent brings word that some!
changes in the existing rules will be!
recommended to the rules committee of j
tlie A. A. U. by a committee of foot- j
ball coaches. Several minor changes j
were discussed at the meeting, but final
recommendations will lie inade by the
committee. Any changes suggested by
such a body as the National Association
of Football Coaches are given great
consideration by the rules committee.
Another suggestion which received fa
vorable comment was the proposal to
establish a national substitute for
American football for boys under 15
years of age. The proposed game is j
similar to regular football, but elimi- j
nates much of the roughness which often j
proves harmful to young boys.
The coaches take the view that the j
new game would benefit the boys' plivsi-1
cal development and would be excellent i
training leading to the regular Anieri- [
can game in later years.

such a body as the National Association
of Football Coaches are given great
consideration by the rules committee.
Another suggestion which received fa
vorable comment was the proposal to
establish a national substitute for
American football for boys under 15
years of age. The proposed game is j
similar to regular football, but elimi- j
nates much of the roughness which often j
proves harmful to young boys.
The coaches take the view that the j
new game would benefit the boys' plivsi-1
cal development and would be excellent i
training leading to the regular Anieri- [
can game in later years.
