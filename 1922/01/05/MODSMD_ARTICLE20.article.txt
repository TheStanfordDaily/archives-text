# The
						Passing of the Old Field
## 
### 
The new year marks the passing of a landmark.
That the old order changeth is proven again in the
wrecking of the old football bleachers. When the
football field was built in 1 *>05 it was regarded as
among the best of modern gridiron plants. Since
that time the popularity of football has increased to
sue!i an extent that the once commodious field has
become iuadequate.
Stadiums are now the fashion, and Stanford, well
up in the van of college progress, has built the first
great stadium in the state. With the construction
of the bowl.'the football bleachers have ceased to be
of any use. and they are now being torn down.
What a story those bleachers could tell 'f they had
the power of speech. Many times have the masses
seated upon them felt the thrill of the contest being
waged on the field below. Many times have they
reverberated to the cheers of the rival rooting sec
tions.
Prior to 1904 all Rig Games were played in San
Francisco. In that year Stanford and California
determined to bring the games to their own campuses.
California led off with the construction of its pres
ent playing field, which was dedicated in 1904 with
a Stanford victory. The following year. 1905. Stan
ford dedicated its own field with another victory over
the Bruins. In 1906 both universities changed to
rugby football and four of these games were played
on the Stanford turf field during the succeeding
nine years. Of the four Stanford won two and lost
two.
Following the break in relations between Stan
ford and California the Big Games of American
football were resumed in 1919, when the Bears won
a 14 to 10 victory. That was the last Big Game that
will ever be staged on the turf field, and it evened
up the games won and lost by the two rivals there.
In the interim the Cardinal defeated Santa Clara
two games out of three in Rugby.
When the bleachers have been removed a fence
will be built around the field and it will be used as
a practice lot in the years to come. All that will be
left of the original plot will be the immutable goal
posts over which many a ball has been kicked, bring
ing gladness to one faction and sadness to the other.
Three times have the Blue and (}old rooters tossed
their hats over the cross bar, and as many times
have the Cardinal rooters traced a joyful dance be
tween the white posts.
In the future the stadium will be the scene of all
Big ( lames played on this campus, but the old field
will still perform a function for it is there that the
teams that will carry the Cardinal to victory will be
trained.
