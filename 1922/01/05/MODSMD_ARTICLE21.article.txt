# Resolve to Study
## 
### 
Students return to the University this quarter with
many good New Year resolutions. The spirit of the
incoming year has imbued them with high and
mighty ideals, and they make their consciences many
fine promises.
Probably the commonest resolve is to do today's
studying today. They remember, possibly with
some regrets, the last examination period when they
were not prepared as well as they might have been.
Those long hours of intensive cramming still linger
in the memory and serve to heighten the resolves
for the beginning of the quarter.
After a few days, or at best, a few weeks, all of
the New Year resolutions are broken. Hut if the
resolve to study daily lasts even for a short period
of time it will be valuable because it is during the
first few days that the basic principles and thoughts
governing a course are learned.
So make an effort to keep your good resolutions.
The energy expended in trying will prove valuable
even if you can not preserve them for very long.
