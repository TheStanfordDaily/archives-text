Dear Head of Cabbage:
Gone is the famous Mayfield road,
Of which alumni boast,
But still Bill Irwin's holding up
The Saturday Evening Post.

Sa. Tow Irwin, for one quarter more I'll help hold up
the cabbage colyum. This week I got something to say
about the January frosli now on the campus, Frinstance,
there's*tliisS frosh outburst:
* * *
I come from New York City. Years ago I first dream
ed of coming to the premier university of the West. I
saw the Stanford '15 crew, the giants of the Pough
keepsie, the most powerful specimens of manhood ever
assembled in an eastern athletic contest. I heard they
were all such giants because they were products of the
Stanford Farm, nourished by its food, raised in the
California sunshine. 1 resolved some day 1 would go
to that Farm of the West where they grow athletes.
My vision beheld a wonderful Palo Alto stock farm and
dairy ranch. I saw students fed on the finest dairy
products, the most luscious Truit that ever the Golden
State produced. I beheld acres of truck gardens on that
great 7,000 acre farm, with the best crops. I knew now
why Stanford athletes are supreme —the University
feeds them, and only the best. Stanford produced
Hoover, who fed the world.
Last Monday I began as a freshman at Stanford. I
find 1 can do one of two things, eat at the UNION or
at the INN.
* * *
I arrived a month ago and looked for clear, sparkling
Lake Lagunita, where the famous crews came from, and
beheld a pasture, but the shock was nothing compared
to the debris for food I've gotten. Back to the tene
ments of New York.

Cheer up, buddy, the darkest gloom is just before the
dawn. Our Alma Mater feeds us at her Commons soon.
"Doc." Angell says we grow athletes on the Farm but he
ain't heard nothing yet.
* * *
In honor of such new freshman, I give advance ex
cerpts of a translation into modern English I am mak
ing of Gray's Elegy. He took seven years. I'll get
more than that for mine:
* * *
Can bubbling urn, in which Sophs put their trust,
Bring forth a man all free from first-year bosh?
Can wat'ry tubs take off his coat of rust?
Can paddles teach the dull, dead brain of Frosh?
For Knowledge to their eyes her mystic page.
Rich with Skull and Snakes, will not unroll,
The Sophs' chill tubs repress their noble rage.
And freeze the genial current of their soul.
Full many a Frosh, once too serene,
The seemingly unfathomed tublets bear.
E'en tho they're flowers they should blush unseen.
Nor waste their sweetness on a damsel fair.
*
Far from the Engineering Corner's strife.
Their sober wishes should have learned to stray,
Along a cool, sequestered vale of life.
They'd better keep the even tenor of their way.
For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
Has queened upon the Quad, has spoke his mind
To Sophs, and hoped to go for all the day
Without the dink that he had left behind.
\
On such poor hides the paddles quickly fly,
Some pious drops the Soph for him requires.
E'en from his tub the voice of Froshes cries,
E'en in their soreness live revengeful fires.

Be sure to get your next Thursday's Daily. Cabbages
will expose the methods of coast football coaches and
foretell the future. Magnificent, thrilling, but not for
sale at all newstands.

Tomorrow try-outs are held for Tri-state debating
teams. That activity deserves lots more interest here.
Wouldn't it have been great if instead of a handful at
the last U. C. debate we could have had the following
write-up:
* * *
It was an ideal night for the Big Debate. Sixty-five
thousand people jammed into the great Stanford Bowl.
The moon shone big and full on the big "S" formed by
the rooters with white pajamas and red flannels. Cali
fornia used candles to form a burning yellow "C." Amid
the deafening din of the rooters the refree's whistle
sounded. Mr. Soupstreener, for Stanford, stepped to
the Magnavox. "Varsity on the throat-clearing" came
the voice of Bob Connolly. "Shoot 'em an Oski," com
manded Saylor, who ruled the "C." "There is but one
conclusion," began Mr. Soupstreener, "to this debate
and that is the side we intend to present on the af
firmative." The Stanford sector roared its approval. A
prolonged demonstration followed. "We want a touch
down." "Score, Stanford," yelled the leatherlungs. Cali
fornia came back equally strong when Miss Press
mounted the platform. "We'll win." chuckled the
Bruins, "We've got the best line." Richard Jangles then
continued the offensive. When A. E. Murfee took his
place on the rostrum the Bruin Golds were jubilant.
"How can we lose; our second line is as good as our
first." Knocks Filler showed uncanny skill at running
back California's boots. Soupstreener furnished excel
lent interference. But Murfee broke thru for a vicious
tackle. He earned his place on Walter Vamp's All-
Mexican outfit. He is beyond doubt the greatest talker
in the history of his institution, with the exception of
"brick" Morse of '98. Stanford fought desperately but
could not turn the tide. California dashhunded the
field. Aftnr the bull-throwing contest the California
Varsity was the guest of Coach Blemerson at all-night
ball and cabaret at the President's Mansion on Lagunita
Knoll. The freshman's aeroplane was then used for
n sight-seeing trip, the Californians returning home via
New Orleans and Ravenswood. Stanford swears revenge
in the big spring event, when the Domino and Lotto
tennis meet.
