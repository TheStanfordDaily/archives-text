# Do You Know The Largest Elevator Installation in the World?
## 
### 
The efficiency achieved at the huge
United States Army Supply Base in
Brooklyn, N. Y., is largely attributable
to the use of Otis Push Button Con
trol Self-Leveling Elevators —in con
junction with tractor trains.
This is the largest elevator installa
tion in the world, consisting of ninety
six elevators, ninety of which are 10,-
000 pounds capacity Otis Freight Ele
vators of the self-leveling automatic
type.
Th§ elevators in the warehouses are
operated in banks of ten and seven, by
means of simple dispatch boards, so
that one dispatcher operates an en
tire bank of elevators. No operators
are needed on the elevators them
selves.
Due to the elimination of operators'
salaries alone, this Otis installation
saves about $ltio,ooo a year in operat
ing expense.
The same efficiency and proportion
ate savings will be obtained through
the use of Otis Push Button Automatic
Elevators in any industrial building
of two or more floors. —Adv.
