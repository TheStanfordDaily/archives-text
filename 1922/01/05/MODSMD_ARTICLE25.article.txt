# Harvard Business School To Admit Selected Group
## 
### 
In rder to give men who finish their
colK-ye course in the middle of the aca
dem: â€¢ year ;i chance to begin their busi
ness training at once, the Harvard Busi
ness School will adopt experimentally
this,year a new policy of admitting a
limited group of carefully selected col
lege graduates on January 3D, 1922. Dean
Wallace B. Donhain announced last
night.
The program of work for men enter
ing in January will be so adjusted that
they will be able to complete the regular
course for the degree of Master of Busi
ness Administration in the usual time of
tun years, graduating in January, 1924.
"'I bis plan is distinctly an experiment,"
explained Dean Donham. "Two years
ago we allowed a few unusually able
students to enter in the middle of the
year, with very satisfactory results, but
we have never admitted any considerable
number at that time. Whether we shall
ultimately have two groups in the school,
one shift entering in September and the
other in January, depends on the work
ing of this experiment. It is entirely
possible, for our larger courses are al
ready divided into sections, and it may
prove :,s convenient to. start some sec
tions in September and others in Jan
uary a- to start them all simultaneously.
The school is obliged to limit numbers
each year, but by dividing the group into
two parts we can take care of more men
than would otherwise be possible.
"Many men of unusual ability finish
their college course in three and a half
years, and it is such men as these that
we wish to accommodate with this new
arrangement, so that they will not have
to wait until September to begin their
business training. The plan was sug
gested by a number of such men, who
fell that under existing business condi
tions they had no other opportunity to
use this period profitably.
"We shall make our seletcions with
particular care, considering the applica
tions in the order in which they come

in. We should like to get in January a
small group of men as nationally repre
sentative as the class which entered in
September. This class included 46 men
i from Harvard College, 16 from tlie Uni-
J versity of California, 10 each from Yale
| and Leland Stanford, and smaller groups
I from each of 103 other colleges and uni-
I versities all over the country."
