and Switzerland, collecting material for
the Hoover War Collection. He trav
eled through these countries in uniform
and with credentials from Herbert
Hoover which gained him easy admis
sion to the places he desired to go. In
the various towns in which he stopped,
he stayed at the local headquarters of
the. American Mission, to which com
fortable homes or palaces had been
turned over, or in rare instances' he was
billeted out in the town. Most of this
journey was made by train and auto
mobile, but from Budapest to Belgrade,
Professor Lutz went down the Danube

capitals of the countries through which
he passed, he visited the foreign minis
ters and obtained promises of the de
sired material, most of which has been
or is being sent to Stanford and which
