# VAN GENT MAKES FINAL CUT IN BASKETBALL SQUAD
## Varsity Coach Names Eighteen Players on Return to Campus 
### 
Coach Gene Van Gent today named
! the eighteen men from the squad of
! forty basketball candidates upon whom
efforts will be concentrated to turn
out a championship cage team.
Those on the first squad are: Cap
tain Davies, Janssen, Rogers, Rich
mond, De Groot, Anderson, Campbell,
Pollard, Pitts, Hood, Neer, Gerson,
Larson, Clouthurst, McHose, Cleve
land, Howell, and G. Smith.
The names of but three full-fledged
veterans appear in the list. Berth
Davies and Richmond were members
of the championship quintets of 1919
and 1920. Rogers played at one of the
forward positions off and on last year,

alternating most of the time with j
Davies.
New suits have been ordered. The
jerseys will be red with a small white
block "S" in the center, and the
trunks will be khaki color.
Although the personnel of the first
squad may be changed later, Van Gent
will devote most of his time in teach
ing the above named eighteen the fine
points of the game.
Stringent training rules went into ef
fect for the squad yesterday. The one
thing that \an Gent is insisting on is <
that every man be in the best possible !
condition for the opening game January J
11. A training table will probably be.
established next week so that the squad j
will eat the evening meal together.
I lungs began to take shape rapidly
when \ an Gent appeared on the Enciua
court to take up the reins where he
dropped them two weeks ago on ac
count of the holidays.
From 5 o'clock until nearly 7 the Dig
blond coach had the first string players
going at top speed with very little let
up. First came random basket shoot
ing, then Some short passing, and the
close of the practice found Van Gent's
charges drilling on a few of the more
simple plays of the court game.
\ an Gent is carefully laying the foun
dation of the tive that is to represent
the Cardinal. His men are being
grounded in the fundamentals of the
game, and up to the present no time has
been given to anything save the essen
tials.
I here was no practice game yester
day, Van Gent drilling the squad on ]
several plays, and none of the squad
had an opportunity to show what he!
could do in action.
The one big task in developing the
team this year is to find some one to
fill the vacancy left by the graduation |
of Fred Adams, captain of the 19201
quintet. Adams' work at standing guard |
was nothing short of phenomenal, and
lie was named as All-Coast guard for
1920. Dud De Groot. the big center on
the 1921 football eleven, has an ideal
build for the standing guard position.
Glenn Pollard, of last year's squad, is
another possibility for Adams' successor, j

Coach Gene Van Gent today named
! the eighteen men from the squad of
! forty basketball candidates upon whom
efforts will be concentrated to turn
out a championship cage team.
Those on the first squad are: Cap
tain Davies, Janssen, Rogers, Rich
mond, De Groot, Anderson, Campbell,
Pollard, Pitts, Hood, Neer, Gerson,
Larson, Clouthurst, McHose, Cleve
land, Howell, and G. Smith.
The names of but three full-fledged
veterans appear in the list. Berth
Davies and Richmond were members
of the championship quintets of 1919
and 1920. Rogers played at one of the
forward positions off and on last year,

alternating most of the time with j
Davies.
New suits have been ordered. The
jerseys will be red with a small white
block "S" in the center, and the
trunks will be khaki color.
Although the personnel of the first
squad may be changed later, Van Gent
will devote most of his time in teach
ing the above named eighteen the fine
points of the game.
Stringent training rules went into ef
fect for the squad yesterday. The one
thing that \an Gent is insisting on is <
that every man be in the best possible !
condition for the opening game January J
11. A training table will probably be.
established next week so that the squad j
will eat the evening meal together.
I lungs began to take shape rapidly
when \ an Gent appeared on the Enciua
court to take up the reins where he
dropped them two weeks ago on ac
count of the holidays.
From 5 o'clock until nearly 7 the Dig
blond coach had the first string players
going at top speed with very little let
up. First came random basket shoot
ing, then Some short passing, and the
close of the practice found Van Gent's
charges drilling on a few of the more
simple plays of the court game.
\ an Gent is carefully laying the foun
dation of the tive that is to represent
the Cardinal. His men are being
grounded in the fundamentals of the
game, and up to the present no time has
been given to anything save the essen
tials.
I here was no practice game yester
day, Van Gent drilling the squad on ]
several plays, and none of the squad
had an opportunity to show what he!
could do in action.
The one big task in developing the
team this year is to find some one to
fill the vacancy left by the graduation |
of Fred Adams, captain of the 19201
quintet. Adams' work at standing guard |
was nothing short of phenomenal, and
lie was named as All-Coast guard for
1920. Dud De Groot. the big center on
the 1921 football eleven, has an ideal
build for the standing guard position.
