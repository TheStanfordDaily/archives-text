# LAST FIXTURES OF NEW PAVILION NOW BEING INSTALLED
## First Plate Glass Backstops on Coast Will Be Put in; Indirect Lighting is Used 
### 
Construction of the basketball pavilion h
has entered the final stages. The ex
terior has been completed, except fori
landscaping, and the last of the interior j
fixtures are being installed, so that the j
i building will present a finished appear- !
ance when opened to the public in the j
dedication dance January 13.
Backstops of plate glass, the first of
this kind to be used on a Pacific Coast
court, have arrived and will be set in
place at once, i hey are to be suspended
from the ceiling by an elaborate steel
: frame, which can be swung up out of the
I way when the baskets are not in use.
i The glass backstop provides a surface of
! uniform resilience and smoothness.
Owing to the swelling of the maple
boarding composing the spring floor, due
j to water let in when several windows
I were broken in the recent storm, the
floor will not be quite even for some
j time. As soon as practicable it is to be
! dried out thoroughly by a machine blow-
I ing hot air underneath the maple sur
' face. It will be gone over thoroughly
! with a sandpapering machine, and then
treated with hot, boiled linseed oil. As
J soon as the building has thoroughly
j dried out, the irregularities may be re
moved without the necessity of planing.
All lighting is to be indirect, thus
eliminating the glares which often con
fuse players. Twenty-two flood lights
with reflectors to the ceiling will rang
along each side, and the lights under the
I balcony will be concealed from direct
! view of the players. Half of the reflec
i tors are already installed, and were tried
j out successfully Tuesday evening.
The balconies, which will run the en
| tire length of the building on both sides,
( will be completed by the end of the
{ week. Plastering work was finished to
j day.
The ventilating system has been de-
I signed especially for this type of build-
I ing, to insure a maximum circulation of
; air without subjecting the crowds to
| drafts. A row of windows runs along
j the top of the pavilion on both sides.
34 feet above the surface. This height
j will eliminate the breezes characteristic
! of most pavilion ventilation systems.
With the spring floor, lighting system,
j and ventilating system, tlie Stanford pa
i vilion will, in the opinion of Comptroller
I Roth, take its place as the finest court
|on the coast. It is said to be the only
! building of any size in the country de
-1 voted primarily to basketball, with the
l fixtures arranged to give the greatest
i possible advantage to the players. It
I was planned to hold 3000 people, but
Graduate Manager Fletcher said on
I looking over the constructiont hat it 1
j would take a capacity crowd of 3700.
