# Excavation by Boathouse To Replace Diving Tower
## 
### 
Immediately following the cata
strophe to the diving tower, experi
ments proved that it was feasible to
make an excavation next the boat
house, and thus give the needed depth.
A four-foot excavation has been dug,
i and now awaits further rise of the
water. The clay in which the excava
tion is made was shown to be able to
hold water, and with the new hole the
water will be deep enough for all
S diving purposes.
It is estimated that at the present
; rate the Lagunita will be full within
I three weeks.
