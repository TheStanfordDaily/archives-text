# Spring Sport Tryoutees Asked to Report to Gym
## 
### 
Due to the fact that several of the
spring sports are starting the new
sport manager system for the first
time, the tryouts are to be opened for
both juniors and sophomores. Those
wishing to try out will report to the
sport manager as indicated elsewhere
in this issue. Hereafter a tryoutee
must select one branch of sport from
which he can not be transferred.
