## 
### 
Nestoria's team for the yearly de
bate with Euphronia, chosen as a re-!
suit of tryouts last night, consists of
Leland Stanford, '24, captain; Bert-,
rand Comparet, '24, and Howard W.,
Dryden, '24. Stanford was a member;
of the second varsity team, and Com- \
paret alternate on the first squad, in ;
the debate with California. Dryden
is a transfer from O. A. C., and was
active in debating there.
Nestoria has submitted the quest
tion of the sales tax, the subject of the
trl-state debate, to Euphronia, but has I
not as yet heard which side their de
baiing rivals have chosen. The names
of ten prospective judges of the con
test, from which Euphronia is to pick
three, have also been submitted by
Nestoria.
The date for the contest has been |
changed by mutual consent from Janu
ary 21 to 25. so as not to fall on a ;
week-end. The rules formulated by
the California Debating Societies'
League will be used in conducting and
judging the debate.
