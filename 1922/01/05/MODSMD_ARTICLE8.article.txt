Candidates for Euphronia's debating!
team to meet Nestoria, January 25,1
will try out this evening in the law
lecture hall, Room 113. The subject of
the debate, on which the tryoutees will
contest, is: "Resolved, That the United
States should impose a tax on manu

The Euphronia-Nestoria debate, j
which will take place this year as part
of the schedule of the California De
bating Societies' League, is an annual
event between the two societies. The
subject chosen this year is the same
as that of the tri-state debate, and it
is expected that the winner of the
league contest will largely make up
the Stanford intercollegiate team, be
sides representing Stanford in con

bating league.
