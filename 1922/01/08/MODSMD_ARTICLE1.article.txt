# REPORT SHOWS LARGE NUMBER TO HAVE FAILED
## Incomplete Figures Give 113 Failures, 323 Probations; Larger Than Ever Before 
### 
Statistics released by Professor C. B.
Whittier, chairman of the Scholarship
Committee, today show a greater per
centage of disqualifications for the au
tumn quarter than for any other quarter
in the past. One hundred and thirteen
students were disqualified. This consti
tutes 4 per cent of the student body, in
contrast to the usual 2% per cent hereto
fore. According to Professor Whittier,
these figures are not surprising in view
of the raised scholastic standards.
Three hundred and twenty-three stu
dents were placed on probation. This
also is a considerable increase over the
figures of other quarters. According to
the new regulation which went into ef
fect last quarter, a student is put 011
scholastic probation if he makes less than
22 counts or falls materially below a
"C" average. Students making less than
10 counts during their first or second
quarters in the university are subject to
disqualification, and those failing to make
15 counts or falling far below a "C"
average in succeeding quarters may also
be disqualified according to the new
ruling. These rules and figures vary
from quarter to quarter.
Under the new system, probation
amounts to a serious warning, as any
student remaining on probation for three
successive quarters may lie disqualified.
The results of this new provision will
not be felt until the spring quarter, how
ever, as it was first put into effect in the
autumn quarter.
The number of disqualifications may
be reduced during the next few
days, owing to reconsideration of some
cases. The Scholarship Committee is
meeting frequently to go over records,
and correct errors. Due to this fact
and to the lateness of some reports these

figures are only temporary, and may be
materially changed. The number of
probations, particularly, may be reduced.
