# NEW DEBATE SUBJECT ASKED BY EUPHRONIA
## 
### 
Owing to a misunderstanding oil the
selection of the question for the Xes- i
toria-Euphronia debate, no tryouts were j
conducted by Euphronia Society at its
meeting last night. Fuphronia officials
claim that under the rules of the Cali
fornia Debating Societies League, two
questions are to be submitted, while Nes
toria only turned in one, tiiat of the sales
tax. This question was also held to be
unsuitable on account of the shortness
of time allowed for preparation. A con
ference will be sought between officers !
the two societies as soon as possible, in !
which subjects satisfactory to both will j
be determined. It is expected that the j
date of the contest will be postponed |
also.
