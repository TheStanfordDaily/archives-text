### 
There are many Denipseys, Ruths, j
Johnsons, Mathewsons, Smiths, and
Midlers—hut there is only one Aurreo
cocchea. Some people are horn Slando
vitch and,come out Smith, hut the new
coach ot the Santa Clara basketball live j
' was born Aurreococchea and lias stayed j
Aurreococchea.
Recause liis name is as hard to write!
as it looks, and because it is harder still ■
for the unaccustomed tongue to pro- j
nouncc, sport writers on the city dailies j
have dubbed him Joe Sneeze.
The particular kind of sneeze that it ;
is proper to execute when referring to !
the Mission coach is largely a matter |
of individual taste, according to the |
writers.
In keeping with his uncommon name, j
Joe seems to have developed a basket !
ball team that is also uncommon. The
combination of two basket shooters from
the Livermore Cowboy live and three
veterans of Santa Clara athletics, plus
Joe's coaching, has made the Santa Clara
quintet one of the most feared cage
teams in the state.
So, after all, what's in a name?
