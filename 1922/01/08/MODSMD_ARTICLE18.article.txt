### 
J. Stitt Wilson will make his 1922 ap
pearance on the Stanford campus Sun
'day evening, January 8, at what is
j expected to be one of the largest all
university assemblies held within recent
j years, when he addresses the Stanford
students and all others who care to be
j present, on world problems and the so
| lution as lie sees it. Ihe Assembly
j Hall will be the scene. Seven forty-live
I has been the time set for the address.
Wilson, well known all over the
I nited States, and in other countries as
well, for bis speaking prowess and the
personal grip he gets on bis audience
i while discussing vital problems of the
day, is coming to Stanford to deliver
i a series of five talks on "Constructive
C hiistian Democracy." His first ap
pearance on the campus will be on Sun
day morning. He will take charge of
the services at the Memorial Church at
II o clock, and deliver the sermon of
the morning. All people from Palo Alto
as well as from Stanford who are in
terested in the opportunity to hear Wil
son have been invited to attend.
How to control wealth for the benefit
oi the many—that is one of the most
important problems facing the world
today, as Wilson sees it, and bis way to
a solution of the problem is an interest
ing one. He believes in the democratiz
ing of industry, but is strongly against
any form of sabotage or I. W. W. men
ace. The concentration of wealth in
the hands of the few is one of the ques
tions confronting every country today,
and Wilson, during his talks on "World
Problems'' lays perhaps the greatest
stress upon the economic phase.
Wilson has been talking during the
last two years especially to college au
diences, and he has made a reputation
for getting his audience interested and

! word. Recently be has been to Prince
ton, Northwestern, and other prominent

upon which Wilson will touch is the
personal problem of the student who is
leaving the university in a short time
and is uncertain as to what he will do.
Wilson, during his talks, will develop
this subject along with the others which
lie will present.
On Monday night lie will make his

! sembly held for the fourth of bis series.

I campus organizations, including the Y.
| M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A., and the
j Junipero Serra Club.
