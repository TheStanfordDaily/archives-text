# ST. SAENS NUMBERS TO COMPOSE ORGAN RECITALS NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
All of next week, beginning with
Sunday, Warren D. Allen, University
Organist, will play compositions by
Oamille St. Saens, the French com
poser who died last month. This
great musician who is called the
"Grand Old Man" of French music,
during his eighty-six years of a very
busy lifetime, came into contact with a
world of events more thoroughly than
any other artist of his time. He was
a great traveler, a savant, a writer on
many subjects, and equally successful
as a composer, organiser, and pianist.
His activity was amazing, even until
his death, 011 December 16, in Algiers.
Hia last visit 'to .America was in
1915. St. Saens was under contract
for a tour of his country in 1922. In
all his work he reflects his personality
of composer, revealing a character of
suave urbanity, polish and exquisite
refinement.
During his youth, the great com
poser was condemned for his modern
istic tendencies. Later he held aloof
from the modern school of composers
led by France, such as Debussy, Ravel
and d'lndy. Therefore his music has
seemed somewhat old-fashioned. Ex
tremely fond of Mozart, much of the
lafter's charm, freshness and spontane
ity creep out in the work of St. Saens.
The following program is announced
for Sunday, January S, in Memorial
Church, at. 4:00:
In Memoriam:
Prelude and Fugue in E major
Benediction and Nuptiale
Le Cygne (The Swan)
(Transcribed for organ by Alexander
Guilmant)
Fantaisie in D flat
Tuesday, at 4:15, Sunday's program
will be repeated.
