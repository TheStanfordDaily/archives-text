# What's in a Nickname?

### 
A professor at the University of Washington
has discovered that a "Sun-Dodger" "is a person
who stays up all night and sleeps during the day;
in other words, a sort of rounder. The Graduate
Manager therefore thinks it unwise to call the
Washingtonians by that appellation and tells the
press that hereafter they shall be known as the
"Vikings. I hit the student leaders dissent and
ask the press to wait a few days before making
the change until the students can vote on it. Which
procedure raises the question, "What's in a nick
name ?"
Stanford has, in the past, had very little trouble
in finding a suitable nickname. Since all of the
tigers, bears, and bulldogs were monopolized at
the time this institution was founded the name of
the dominating Stanford color, Cardinal, was
adopted through usage, and it has grown to have
a peculiarly sentimental feeling attached to it. Jt
is a good round word with a meaning distinctly
its own, and like the Crimson of Harvard, this
appellation and its connection has come to be known
all over the country.
True, Stanford once sought an emblem and adopt
ed the now laughable "Wahoo Bird," but this verte
brate was short lived. The historic Stanford axe
which the "Waho'o Bird" was to replace is still safely
guarded by the University of California, and since
the Bird incident no effort has been made to find a
substitute for it.
This is what would likely occur if an effort were
made to call a wearer of the Cardinal by any other
name.
There is, then, quite a meaning in a nickname,
•especially it" it is a good one. We sincerely hope the
Washington students vote to retain "Sun-Dodgers"
•as their by-word, for after all the average college stu
dent is a night hawk to some extent as instructors
of eight-o'clock classes can testify.
