# Four Major Sports
## 
### 
Four of the five majbr college sports will occupy
the spare time and the efforts of Stanford students
during the winter quarter. Basketball is already
under way in many institutions, and the season will
he opened here on January 11. Baseball is next on
the calendar, and the diamond season will begin in
February. March finds the first of the track meets
scheduled. Tennis will be going continually, as it is
an all-year-round sport. *
Besides these four major sports there are more
than twice that number of minor sports. As a con
sequence students are going to be rather busy dur
ing this and the succeeding quarter, but particularly
during this quarter.
The major purpose in coming to college, of course,
is to secure an education. 1 he first essential, then,
is to study in order to gain the knowledge necessary
to pass in the courses taken. But every red-blooded
student wants to get into an activity, and the com
monest and most alluring activity is athletics. Many
men make the mistake of going into an activity in a
half-hearted manner. They will choose one sport
and then shift to another within a short time with the
result that they benefit neither themselves nor the
institution.
With so many things to choose from, a great deal
of judgment is necessary before making a selection.
Once the selection is made the student should stick to
it and give everything lie has toward making himself
a success. Even if he fails to make a team he will
derive a great deal of benefit from the effort he has
put forth. If he does make a team he will be aiding
Stanford as well and will earn the greater satisfac
tion of being a member of a successful team.
The object then should be to pick one activity and

stick to it. If you make the team you are helping
Stanford, as well as yourself; if you do not make the
team, you at help yourself, and the efforts you
have put forth will have caused someone else to work
harder.
