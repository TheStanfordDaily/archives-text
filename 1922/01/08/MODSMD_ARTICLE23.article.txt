Carl Shoup, Monday Conductor,
Hal Rorke, Tuesday Dispatcher.
Phil Newill, Wednesday Engineer.
S. G. Trimble, Thursday Section Boss.
Henry Mack, lit Friday Caboose
Now that the annual struggle is over, and Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday have used up the New Year
Resolution jokes, Cabbages is once more free to start
the education of the masses in real, applied humor.

You never know real innocence until you see it in
print. Thursday's outburst is put to shame by this:

Idols of Clay
Here's to the dearest of all things on earth,
Here's to the sweetest, and yet of full worth,
One who lays siege to susceptible hearts,
Pocketbooks also —that's one of her arts.
Drink to her, toast to her, your bankroll unfurl —
Here's to our idol —'the sweet Stanford girl.

Needless to say, this Freshman has never queened
on the campus.

Horace—procure the blister-stick.

(Special K. I. N. M. A. Flash)
Stanford University, California, Jan. 1. —Delta Beta,
honorary student fraternity, announces a heavy enroll
ment since the end of last quarter. The D. B.'s say
that before long they will enroll the entire campus in
their organization. Rumor has it that they are being
encouraged to a great extent by the faculty.

Choose Your Exit —or —A Post-Christmas Tragedy
Gone are the days of my innocent childhood.
Gone are the days of my fanciful years,
Fled to the maze of mind's tangled wildwood.
Seeking a rest from my doubts and my fears.
Gone are the thoughts of the fairies and goblins,
Elfins who peopled my sweet youthful dreams,
Gone are the thoughts of a free-giving Santa —
My bills are arriving for Christmas, it seems.

Popular superstitions—That you can walk down the

Friday has the original hard-luck story. After months
of hard work, we finally secured one lone contributor —
and then the committee gave him the air.

Struggle—But Not Too Much
There was a young lady from Siam,
She had a bold lover named Hiram.
"I don't want to be kissed,
But if you insist,
Gawd knows —you are stronger than I am.

A Seedy Story
There was a young fellow from Leeds,
Who swallowed a package of seeds.
The darned silly ass
Broke all out in grass,
And now you can't see him for weeds.

Foiled!
Her eyes tare blue,
Her hair is black,
She wears it hanging down her back.
Her lips are red,
Each tooth a pearl,
I surely wish she was my girl.
Her clothes are fine.
Her name is Moll —
BUT she's my sister's baby doll.

L' Envoi
Two men were stumbling homewards in the early, chilly
morn,
They walked a bit unsteady, and they seemed a bit
forlorn.
They traveled thru the darkness of the early Sabbath
day.
And as they came near home and wife, they could be
heard to say:
* * *
Chorus:
There's a bright shining light guiding me home tonight.
And I know that my wife waits for me.
But her thoughts are not tented, or loving—you're right.
Yesterday—it was pay-day, you see!

In the Colloquial
Bertie —Do you want to see a rubberneck buss?
Gertie —Don't you dare!

If the Malthusian theory was accepted in the days of
Methuselah, there must have been plenty of war and
famine.

At the Aquarium
Miss Oyster—A luminous pearl lies between these
two. . . .
Mr. Eel (too slick) —Go on, you can't pull that shell
game on me.

Breath of Spring
She —Breathe hard, John, there's alcohol on your
breath 1

Lagunita Lake is filling.
And the birds with joy are thrilling.
And the silver lining's showing thru the sky.
In the East the sun is glowing,
In my heart new hope is flowing
And the world seems pretty good to such as I.
But one fly is in the ointment,
It is bitter disappointment,
It's the thing that fills the college full of strife.
If I didn't have a lesson,
It would truly be a blessin'
Then I really could enjoy my colloge life!

YOURS TILL THE CANDLE STICKS.
