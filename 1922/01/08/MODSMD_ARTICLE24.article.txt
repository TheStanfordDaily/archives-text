WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
An agreement was reached in the
conference committee on Limitation of
Naval Armaments, whereby the use of
submarines against merchant and pas
senger ships was to be outlawed. This
will ultimately bind the five great
naval powers to refrain from sub
marine warfare in any war between
any of them. The French delegates
agreed after the British failed to ob
tain the inclusion of aeroplanes as
commerce destroyers, terminating in
an entire re-establishment of Franco-
British harmony. This provision
would not interfere with a reconsider
ation of the naval treaty owing to po
litical changes or development of in
ventions.
CHINA
The nine powers at the Washington
Conference, sitting as the committee
on Far Eastern affairs, came to an
agreement whereby Chinese tariff
rates will he increased to an effective
5 per cent. This will provide for the
eventual, though gradual, increase of
the Chinese revenue by $4,600,000.
Also a resolution passed providing
for the eventual withdrawal of foreign
troops from China. The solution pro
vides for a commission of the eight
i powers' ministers at Peking, to ascer
■ tain the facts and recommed action.
It. is expected that the committee will
have completed the nine power treaty
in regard to China and be able to re
} port the same to the Conference next
l week.
IRELAND
It is generally supposed that the
| treaty between the Irish factions
! would be defeated in the vote taken
last night at Dublin. The Peace Com
mittee of the Dail Eireann is endeavor
ing to bring about an agreement be
tween the factions opposed and in
favor of the proposed treaty. This is
supposed to he based upon an effort
to allow the treaty to pass, while safe
guarding tho Republican position in
the future.
