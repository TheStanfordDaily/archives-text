"When you come into your student |
I association, look beyond it to the big!
i world movement of which you are a 1
| pah. You will find the Y. W. C. A. on j
! evt.-y continent: t here are 800 student
j associations in the United States which
| are divided into eleven Ileitis. This na
i tional organization is a big machine
| which cannot function properly unless
every part of it is in good working or
, der,
"The purpose of the Y. W. C. A. is
; service, and every member should take
, an active part in Y. W. work now; don't
wait until you are out of college to
i realize what the Y. W. C. A. means."
j Dorothy Marston, '22. described the
aims and purposes of the different com
mittees of the local association, con
! eluding with an appeal to every new
woman to join the committee in which
: she is most interested.
The freshman cabinet of Y. W. C. A.

i " I he Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight."
Following the stunt, tea was served.
The Y. W. C. A. meets regularly on I
j the first and third Thursdays of every
i month unless special arrangements are
made for another date. The finance
I committee asked that every woman de
i posit her Bookstore receipts in the box
for that purpose in the Bookstore to go
I toward paying the debt on the Women's
Clubhouse.
Miss Hopper, national students'
traveling secretary, who spoke at the
Y. W. C. A. meeting Thursday after
noon, said that tho funds from this
drive will be used to promote the work
of the Y. W. C. A. in some of the fol
j lowing ways:
"There are 4000 paid Y. W. C. A. sec
retaries scattered in the cilies, towns,
and country districts of the United
States. '! hev are working among the
Tndians on our national reservations, the
negroes in the southern states, and
among the foreigners in our large cities.
The Industrial Department of the Y. W.
C. A. maintains recreation centers in
factory cities for the benefit of the girls
who work in the factories and lack a
normal home life. The C.irls' Clubs in
| null towns work with the children, and
through them, reach the parents. The
big citv asosciations have boarding
homes for working girls and clubs for
business and professional women.
"In continental countries, the Ameri
can secretaries train the native secre
taries and when an association is firmly
established, the Americans withdraw
from active part in the work. The Y.
W. C. A. now has associations in France,
Ttalv, Czecho-Slovakia, China, Japan.
India, and Turkey."
The local Y. W. C. A. through its so
cial service committee does work at the
Base Hospital, the Stanford Children's
Convalescent Home. Five Points, among
the grammar and high school girls in the
towns around the University, and at
Lane Clinic in San Francisco.
