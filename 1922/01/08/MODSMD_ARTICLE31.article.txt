# Y. W. C. A. HANDLES ANNUAL DRIVE ON PERCENTAGE BASIS
## 
### 
The annual Y. W. C. A. drive for
$450 which was started last night on the
campus will l>e on the percentage basis
and results from the women's living
groups will be printed in next Monday's
Daily Palo Alto. Last night speakers
went to each of the women's living
groups to explain the need of the funds
and left one woman in each group to
take charge of the drive. One hundred
dollars from the total of $450 will be
given to the work of the Y. W. C. A. in
foreign countries, $150 will go to the
national association, and $200 for use
on the campus. As the aim is to have
every living group contribute 100 per
cent, the committees in charge hope that
each woman will give something, how
ever small the donation may be.
