# ZOOLOGY CLUB PLANS TO HAVE UNIVERSITY BUILD ANIMAL REFUGE
## 
### 
Plans for creating a game preserve
out of llie 80(H) acres comprising the
Stanford barm have been submitted to
President Wilbur by the Zoology Club.
The petition • outlines two plans: first,
for tlie president and trustees of the uni
versity to declare the campus a wild
animal refuge and take steps to give
full protection to wild life, through post
ing of signs, patrolling, and planting of
shelters; second, for the conversion of
the campus, with the exception of the
university community proper and the
arboretum, into a state game refuge, as
provided by an act of the legislature in
1903.

Under the plan for a university game
refuge, rules suggested include the for
bidding of hunting and possession of
guns on the campus, except under permit
from the university, the issuing of per
mits to lessees of farm property author
izing them to kill commonly recognized
injurious species, and the permitting of
responsible persons taking specimens re
quired for scientific study.
The members of the Zoology Club
have volunteered to furnish the labor
necessary for making and posting signs,
have pledged themselves to render all
possible aid in detecting and reporting
violators of the refuge, and otherwise
aiding the university in any conserva
tion plans that may be adopted.
The chief advantages resulting from
state control of the preserve will he a
lessening of expense to the university,
and the somewhat greater weight the
name of the state will carry on the signs
with which the property is posted.
If a state game preserve is made of
the property, conservation measures
would still have to be applied to the
arboretum. The Zoology Club has out
lined a program of conservation under
which it will erect bird houses and bird
baths in the arboretum, will strive to
eradicate tramp dogs and cats and will
conduct an educational campaign among
the school children of the surrounding
communities.
This portion of California possesses
a very rich and varied animal life, it is
pointed out in the petition. This life is
being rapidly depleted and in great need
of protection, as many birds and mam
mals formerly abundant are now only
represented by a few scattered individ
uals, while some kinds have disappeared
altogether. This diminishing of wild
life is due to some extent, it says, to
the development of large areas on the
campus for agriculture, but the most im
portant cause is the illegal hunting and
wanton killings, mostly by people from
off the campus. There is a great deal
of the hilly part of the farm which is
unsuited for agriculture, and formerly
gave shelter to many kinds of animals.
It is to restore these sections to their
former condition that the plan has been
submitted to President Wilbur.
