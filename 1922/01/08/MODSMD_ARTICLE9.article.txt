# Washington and Jefferson Football Team Visits Campus
## 
### 
I he Washington and Jefferson foot
hall team, which arrived in San Fran
cisco late last night, spent this afternoon
on the Farm, and were shown about the
campus.
Coming in machines, they reached
Stanford at 1:30, and had lunch at the
Sigma \u house with Director Powell,
Coach Van Gent, J. E. McDowell, Dean
Culver, Coach Seay, Graduate Manager
Fletcher, and the captains of the major
sports teams.
Ihe team was then taken about the
campus and shown the new stadium, the
basketball pavilion, the Union, and the
gymnasium. They returned to San
Francisco late this afternoon, and will
leave for the Fast tomorrow morning.
The "Presidents" were met in San
Francisco by Graduate Manager W. I).
Fletcher this morning, and were taken
down the peninsula in automobiles.
The squad wis in charge of Earle
"Greasy" N'eale. Neale's rise into
prominence as a football coach this
season has been phenomenal. Taking

charge of football at the Pennsylvania
university in 1919, he turned out
elevens that made good, but not ex
ceptional. but he drilled his men in
the fundamentals of the game, and as
a result his team this year was con
sidered one of the strongest defensive
elevens in the United States. They
were only scored upon once in the
entire season.
Captain Stein of W. and J., named
by Walter Camp as All-American
tackle, was one of the visitors. Stein
amazed the crowd at Pasadena last
Monday by playing almost every po
sition on the team at different times,
besides calling the signals. Erickson,
who proved the most elusive halfback
the Hears have tried to stop this year,
and Brenkert. who did the kicking for
the Presidents, are both quiet chaps.
The visitors were surprised at the
size and unique plan of the Stanford
Stadium. It seemed doubtful to most
of them that the big bowl could have
been completed in less than six
months.
