# J. STITT WILSON TALKS TO CROWD IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## World in Danger, Says Wilson, Unless Struggle for Self Ceases to Be All-Powerful 
### 
"The world today—the entire civiliza
tion—is doubtless facing a very critical
and crucial period."
"It has already entered it, and lias

revolt. Egypt, with eleven millions, is
also in revolt, with the possibility, if the
Rritish withdraw, of an attack by the
Sudanese."
In laying out the plan of his lectures
here, Wilson grouped the problems to
be discussed under four heads: Inter
