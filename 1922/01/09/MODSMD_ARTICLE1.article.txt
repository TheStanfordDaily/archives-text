# J. STITT WILSON TALKS TO CROWD IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## World in Danger, Says Wilson, Unless Struggle for Self Ceases to Be All-Powerful 
### 
"The world today—the entire civiliza
tion—is doubtless facing a very critical
and crucial period."
"It has already entered it, and lias
passed through one phase, one of the
most terrible epochs mankind has ever
known."
"A man should not 'have' an educa
tion ; lie should 'be' an education."
"Science tells us that the reptiles had
possession of the earth for 10,000,000
years, lint these creatures were long
on struggle for self, and short on strug
gle for others. They are gone."
"There are looming upon the horizon
of twentieth century history, black
clouds of racial conflict. No man can
look on the map of the world today
with placidity."
"If we can find the secret of genius,
we are on the trail of the secret of the
universe."
These are samples of the verbal shots
which J. Stitt Wilson, noted lecturer on
the world problems of today, fired at
the crowd of University students and
others who crowded into the Assembly
Hall last night to hear the first of his
four talks before a Stanford All-Uni
versity assembly.
Wilson devoted the greater part of his
talk to the discussion of what he called
"the two great aspects of the life prin
ciple; first, the struggle for self; and
second, the struggle for others." He
traced the evolution of these two as
pects down through the ages and showed
how the predominance of the former
over the latter was at the root of all
the serious trouble that is facing the
world today.
"I am not pessemistic," lie declared,
when touching on the present state of
things in the world today; "but there is
nothing on the face of civilization that
is on a stable equilibrium. India is in
revolt. Egypt, with eleven millions, is
also in revolt, with the possibility, if the
Rritish withdraw, of an attack by the
Sudanese."
In laying out the plan of his lectures
here, Wilson grouped the problems to
be discussed under four heads: Inter
racial, International, Economic, and
Spiritual. "The fundamental bone of
contention among the nations of the
' world today," he said, "is the economic
j problem.
"There are live great streams,' he
| continued, "that flow into the river of
| truth, that will help us to solve the
j world's problems. They arc.: Science.
! History. Philosophy, Art (created by
| geniuses), and Revelation." By means
| (if a "chalk talk" on a blackboard. Wil-
I son traced the influence of these
5 "streams." and also showed how in the
conflict between the "struggle for self"
| and the "struggle for others" the crea
tures who had adhered to the latter
! principle were the one* who had sur
vived and lived in peace and plenty upon
| the earth.
"Who is it." he said, "who have sur
jvived? Is it the sabre-toothed tiger
| or the sheep? Is it the jackal, or the
cattle;e Is it the hyena or the horse?
The sheep and the cattle, and the horse
i have survived because, with them, the
struggle, for others took, precedence
over the struggle for self. They strug
gled with others for the common good.
They are the mammals who have beaten
jb:.ck the doctrine that might is right.
They have established a principle of mit
; tual aid—and they have survived."
Wilson's next lecture will be delivered
tonight in the Assembly Hall at f*
o'clock. The time, formerly set at 7 :30,
has been changed to allow men whose
living vroups have meetings tonight an
opportunity to hear the talk.
