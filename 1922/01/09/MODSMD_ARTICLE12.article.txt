# HOOP SQUAD STARTS SCHEDULE WEDNESDAY
## Opening Game of 1922 Season Will be Played in Encina Gym With Santa Clara Five 
### 
Santa Clara, with the best five that
has represented the Mission college in
| several years, will provide the opposition
for Van Gent's Cardinal varsity in the
{opening game of the 1922 basketball
] season Wednesday night.
I he game will be played on the En
cina gymnasium court, as the new pa
vilion will not be ready until the contest
| with the College of the Pacific next
; Saturday night.
Van Gent has been driving his men
j hard to have them in shape for the Mis
i sionites. Numerous interruptions have
| hindered the Cardinal squad up to the
present time, but now practice, is going
| at top speed every afternoon at the En
j cina court. The final cut in the squad
| marked the last step in the necessary
; preliminaries, and these over, rapid
j progress is being made in developing
i and drilling a capable five.
No mistake is being made in under
| rating Santa Clara. Every college or
â–  university is bound to have its success
i ful year, and Santa Clara's seems to
have arrived in basketball. The Mis-
I sionites always have a fighting quintet
! on the floor, and this year Joe "Sneeze"
j Aurreocochea, their coach, appears to
j have combined a good knowledge of the
court game with the already present
; "fight."
Although Santa Clara's basketball rec
ord to date is good, the Saints are by
no means invincible. The Los Angeles
Athletic Club quintet took two falls out
of them during the Christmas holidays.
Aurrecochea's five took the first tilt, but
I the. Mercuries won the last two by
' scores of 31 and 29 to 19. respectively.
I Outside of the two games with L. A.
j A. C., Santa Clara preserved a clean
I record on its southern tour, winning
| from Whittier, rated as the best in the
j southern conference, 31 to 20.
Three Mission court veterans will ap
| pear on the court here Wednesday night
! for the first time since the temporary
j retirement of Santa Clara from inter
collegiate sport activity. Hal Toso, cap
tain; Jimmy Logan, and Caesar Manelli
I have all worn the colors of the red and
j white against Stanford fives before.
John Vukota, erstwhile member of the
Livermore cowboy five that reached the
semi-finals in the national tournament at
: Kansas City last year, is one of the new
comers on the Santa Clara squad. Vu
kota, according to reports, is well worth
i watching when he starts tossing the ball
toward the basket.
A few changes have been made in the
Cardinal basketball schedule, according
I to Basketball Manager Frnest Wilson.
The University of Southern California,
which was asked to till the date on Feb
ruary 14, will not come north. I he
cancellation of the game with the Tro
jans will give the varsity six days' rest
before the two games with the Univer-
I sity of Oregon here on February 17
and 18.
Arrangements have been completed
! with St. Mary's, and the Phoenix bas
! keters will visit the campus on February
II to square off with Van Gent's five.
