# THREE MILLION DOLLARS SET AS GOAL IN CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED TODAY FOR ADDITIONAL UNIVERSITY ENDOWMENT
## Drive Will Mark One of Greatest Steps in History of Stanford 
### 
With three million dollars as the ultimate goal, the most vital campaign
for the financial support of Stanford University in its history began this
morning. Headquarters were opened in the Administration Building from
which the campaign for "The First Million For Stanford" will be managed.
In making the epochal decision to launch the campaign, the University
authorities did so only after a most careful and searching analysis of the
financial situation confronting Stanford. President Wilbur declares that "it
j is one of the most significant events in the history of Stanford," significant
j because upon its success depends the continuance of the present high standard
of instruction maintained by the University.
To explain the full significance of this financial program, a student

assembly has been called for January
30th, at which time the campaign
and its meaning to the University will
be outlined.
President Wilbur, Lyman L. Pierce,
the director of the campaign, and Dan
Evans, student body president, will
speak.
Student leaders have expressed the
ambition that the campus shall not
follow, but shall lead in this campaign.
Therefore at a recent conference held
by university authorities and student
leaders, it was decided to confine the
stages of the campaign to the campus.
Plans are being worked out whereby
every person living on the campus
will have a chance to cooperate in the
program which promises to be of such
import to Stanford.
Following the conclusion of the
campaign on the campus, the- appeal
will be carried abroad in an ever
widening circle, with the university
as the permanent center of operations.
The success of this appeal will depend
primarily on the response of the stu
dents here on the campus.
The causes of the present need
stretch back over a period of years,
and the "First million" campaign be
came inevitable during the period of
the war, when the dollar almost lost
its purchasing power. This handi
capped Stanford and many other
American universities in carrying out
their educational programs.
From a constructive standpoint, the
present movement for endowment
dates from the report of President
Wilbur for 1918-1 !)19 in which he
pointed out the need for an enlarged
program, including among other things
a readjustment in the salary roll of its
college of Arts and Sciences, giving
the faculty members adequate com-
pensation; the development of a much- j
needed water supply, and the addition j
of certain necessary buildings.
The acid test of the University's j
needs was made when the trustees j
applied to the General Education Board '
for a thorough investigation which
after exacting and painstaking study!
resulted in an offer of $300,000 from
them towards "the First Million."
This finding of the General Educa
tion Board was followed by the recent j
conference of the president of alumni j
associations and class secretaries,
tailed by the trustees. After two
days spent on the campus, going over
the University property, the confer
ence unanimously endorsed the three
million dollar program.
The result of the formal, decision |
of the trustees to launch the program
marked today by the opening of cam-,
paign headquarters and the definite i
formulation of campaign plans.

applied to the General Education Board '
for a thorough investigation which
after exacting and painstaking study!
resulted in an offer of $300,000 from
them towards "the First Million."
This finding of the General Educa
tion Board was followed by the recent j
conference of the president of alumni j
associations and class secretaries,
tailed by the trustees. After two
days spent on the campus, going over
the University property, the confer
ence unanimously endorsed the three
million dollar program.

of the trustees to launch the program
marked today by the opening of cam-,
paign headquarters and the definite i
formulation of campaign plans.

financial organization.
With three million dollars as the ultimate goal, the most vital campaign
for the financial support of Stanford University in its history began this
morning. Headquarters were opened in the Administration Building from
which the campaign for "The First Million For Stanford" will be managed.
In making the epochal decision to launch the campaign, the University
authorities did so only after a most careful and searching analysis of the
financial situation confronting Stanford. President Wilbur declares that "it
j is one of the most significant events in the history of Stanford," significant
j because upon its success depends the continuance of the present high standard
of instruction maintained by the University.
To explain the full significance of this financial program, a student

assembly has been called for January
30th, at which time the campaign
and its meaning to the University will
be outlined.
President Wilbur, Lyman L. Pierce,
the director of the campaign, and Dan
Evans, student body president, will
speak.
Student leaders have expressed the
ambition that the campus shall not
follow, but shall lead in this campaign.
Therefore at a recent conference held
by university authorities and student
leaders, it was decided to confine the
stages of the campaign to the campus.
Plans are being worked out whereby
every person living on the campus
will have a chance to cooperate in the
program which promises to be of such
import to Stanford.
Following the conclusion of the
campaign on the campus, the- appeal
will be carried abroad in an ever
widening circle, with the university
as the permanent center of operations.
The success of this appeal will depend
primarily on the response of the stu
dents here on the campus.
The causes of the present need
stretch back over a period of years,
and the "First million" campaign be
came inevitable during the period of
the war, when the dollar almost lost
its purchasing power. This handi
capped Stanford and many other
American universities in carrying out
their educational programs.
From a constructive standpoint, the
present movement for endowment
dates from the report of President
Wilbur for 1918-1 !)19 in which he
pointed out the need for an enlarged
program, including among other things
a readjustment in the salary roll of its
college of Arts and Sciences, giving
the faculty members adequate com-
pensation; the development of a much- j
needed water supply, and the addition j
of certain necessary buildings.
