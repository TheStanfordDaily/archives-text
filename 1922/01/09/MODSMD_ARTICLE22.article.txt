It is a generally recognized fact that a person goes
to a university to secure an education. Primarily,
then, his first and most constant task must be study.
But a person who studies all the time soon becomes
a sort of moss-back whose entire world is found in
books. He loses another phase of modern education,
that of co-operation with others in the promotion of
some common project. For this reason as much as
for any other, college activities exist.
Usually the best fitted pupils in preparatory schools
come to a university. They are welcomed because
of recognized ability and are made much of during
the first few weeks. They are buoyed up by the
swirl of activities and attentions which are show
ered upon them. Following a week or two of glori
fication these social attentions ftase. The newcomer
has made a decision as to where he will live during
his college life, and he is left alone socially. Then
house duties, and freshman duties are thrust upon
him. He goes into some activity. He is called upon
to decorate for a dance, to clean up the backyard of
the house, to wash the windows, to build a bonfire.
His time is divided between the athletic fields, his
duties, and his studies. Some one of these must
suffer, and usually it is his studies. As a conse
quence. the mortality list at the end of the quarter
shows the names of four or five first-year men
who if they had been given the proper chance would
have become important units in the college commu
nity.
Certainly the present system is woefully inconsis
tent. Selected men who are sent here by the alumni
are diverted from the purposes which should govern
their lives here. Instead of utilizing the energies
of the new comers in the lines that will promote the
greatest good to the University, we dissipate them
under the guise of duties for senseless purposes that
result in the disqualification of the men, and end their
careers and deprive the university of their usefulness.
Obviously a system of duties that distracts the
first-year students does not exist in institutions like
Center College and other small universities whose
successes in lines of collegiate endeavor are so
marked. When we are reminded of these successes
attained by universities with four or five hundred
students it must be brought home to us that there is
really something radically wrong with the system at
.Stanford University.
