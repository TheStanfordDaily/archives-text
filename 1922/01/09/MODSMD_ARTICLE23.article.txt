# The 						All- Women's Assembly
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning the first assembly ever held
by the women of the University—as the Organized
Women, a definite division of the student body—will
be held.
The fact that the women are granted a University
assembly at the same time one is to be held by the
men is significant of increasing recognition of •them
as an active unit in University life. The women of
the University no longer represent a decorative
fringe on the edge of University activity, but are
now an essential factor of it. As such they have
responsibilities and problems of their .own which
they are called upon to meet.
The importance of the presence of every woman
at the Assembly tomorrow is obvious. W omen en
tering the University for the first time will be offi
cially welcomed to their new life and will be given
an introduction to the opportunities and duties which
lie before them. They are to be given the essential
"good start" in the customs, traditions, and institu
tions that mean Stanford.
In addition to the formal greeting of new students,
the main purpose of this official gathering of old
and new members of the five hundred is to present
and explain to them the new modifications of the
motor rule, one of the most important Undertakings

of Women's Conference last quarter, as well as to
outline the revised rushing rules in order to insure
a complete mutual understanding of the regulations.
The first meeting of the Organized Women in
their own assembly is therefore doubly important
and will be of interest to every individual woman
member of the student body. M. J. C.
