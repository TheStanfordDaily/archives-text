Basketball is looming up, and the ferret-eyed (that's
a good word) reporters are sitting up nights lining up a
new vocabulary to do the varsity justice. We way ex
pect any time now to see something like this:
♦ * m
"The casaba tossers trotted onto the court in great
trim, taut and shipshape. Captain Davy's shot a few
baskets from the center of the board-walk, and McGlub
massacred a few more with ease if not accuracy. The
game opened with a passing rush by the opponents'
body goard, and when they untangled the referee from
the heap declared the ball dead.
"For a few succulent moments the hoop artists snap
ped back and forth across the desert of pine, but Bung,
the star middleman, thought he had water 011 the knee
and tried to float across the floor. The jumping guard
cracked him 011 the head with the ball, and the half
ended.
"The basket maulers pranced out at the start of the
second cantata with fresh vaseline 011 their faces and
grim but deadly smiles. For several eons nothing hap
pened, and the Blarney Mcßlarney, playing dead, jumped
up and located the basket, and before any one could stop
him, he shot three and wounded two more. As the
timekeeper's train was due to leave in five minutes,
the spasm was declared over. Final reports on who
won will be available from the cholarship committee
tomorrow."

"The casaba tossers trotted onto the court in great

baskets from the center of the board-walk, and McGlub
massacred a few more with ease if not accuracy. The
game opened with a passing rush by the opponents'
body goard, and when they untangled the referee from
the heap declared the ball dead.
"For a few succulent moments the hoop artists snap
ped back and forth across the desert of pine, but Bung,
the star middleman, thought he had water 011 the knee
and tried to float across the floor. The jumping guard
cracked him 011 the head with the ball, and the half
ended.
"The basket maulers pranced out at the start of the
second cantata with fresh vaseline 011 their faces and
grim but deadly smiles. For several eons nothing hap
pened, and the Blarney Mcßlarney, playing dead, jumped
up and located the basket, and before any one could stop
him, he shot three and wounded two more. As the
timekeeper's train was due to leave in five minutes,
the spasm was declared over. Final reports on who
won will be available from the cholarship committee

Will often land you in the pen;
Beware the curse
Of all free verse
Or you'll be riding in a hearse.
And there'll be flowers all around.
But you won't smell 'em; not a sound
Will thenceforth slip from off your lip.s.

Basketball is looming up, and the ferret-eyed (that's
a good word) reporters are sitting up nights lining up a
new vocabulary to do the varsity justice. We way ex
pect any time now to see something like this:
♦ * m
"The casaba tossers trotted onto the court in great
trim, taut and shipshape. Captain Davy's shot a few
baskets from the center of the board-walk, and McGlub
massacred a few more with ease if not accuracy. The
game opened with a passing rush by the opponents'
body goard, and when they untangled the referee from
the heap declared the ball dead.
"For a few succulent moments the hoop artists snap
ped back and forth across the desert of pine, but Bung,
the star middleman, thought he had water 011 the knee
and tried to float across the floor. The jumping guard
cracked him 011 the head with the ball, and the half
ended.
"The basket maulers pranced out at the start of the
second cantata with fresh vaseline 011 their faces and
grim but deadly smiles. For several eons nothing hap
pened, and the Blarney Mcßlarney, playing dead, jumped
up and located the basket, and before any one could stop
him, he shot three and wounded two more. As the
timekeeper's train was due to leave in five minutes,
the spasm was declared over. Final reports on who
won will be available from the cholarship committee
tomorrow."
