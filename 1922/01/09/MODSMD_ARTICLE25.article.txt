Important Developments at
Cannes.
Following the example set by the dis
armament conference, the Allied Su
preme Council, sitting at Cannes, has
finally decided to rush business. To
Lloyd George go the honors for this
innovation in the working system of the
Council. Stating that "the public opin
ion of the world demands that the Al
j lies take wider responsibilities to revive
I Europe," he proposed the calling of an
international financial conference, early
in March, to which Germany and Rus
sia were to be invited. This was unani
mously approved by the Council, and
Genoa, Italy, was designated as the
meeting place. An important announce
ment following this resolution was that
Lenine had accepted the invitation, and
would meet the allied statesmen in per
son. Lloyd George threw another bomb
in the Council when he announced that
Britain would sacrifice her share, 22 per
cent, of this year's reparations in favor
of France, Italy, and Belgium, if those
countries would agree to cut down the
total amount Germany must pay in 1922.

Following the example set by the dis
armament conference, the Allied Su
preme Council, sitting at Cannes, has

ion of the world demands that the Al
j lies take wider responsibilities to revive
I Europe," he proposed the calling of an
international financial conference, early
in March, to which Germany and Rus
sia were to be invited. This was unani
mously approved by the Council, and
Genoa, Italy, was designated as the
meeting place. An important announce
ment following this resolution was that
Lenine had accepted the invitation, and
would meet the allied statesmen in per
son. Lloyd George threw another bomb
in the Council when he announced that
Britain would sacrifice her share, 22 per
cent, of this year's reparations in favor
of France, Italy, and Belgium, if those
countries would agree to cut down the
total amount Germany must pay in 1922.
