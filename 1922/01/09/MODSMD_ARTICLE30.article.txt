# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY OPENS READING ROOM FOR RESEARCH WORK
## 
### 
A reading room for the Hoover War
Library has been opened this quarter in
tlie library in the formerly unoccupied
space opposite the reference room. It
is open from 1 to 5:30 and from 7 to 10
on week days, and from 8:30 to 12 on
Saturday mornings. This room lias a
separate library staff with Miss Xina
Almond at its head. The other members
will be a reference librarian, a cata
loguer and several student assistants.
The room is intended mainly for the
use of students doing special research
work and not for popular use. At pres
ent there are two students working for
doctor's degrees and eight for master's
degrees in the History Department who
are using this collection for material.
A very small part of the Hoover War
Library has been catalogued up to this
time. Tt'is considered as the most im
portant collection of its kind on the Pa
cific coast, and in the United States it is
second only to the Library of Consrress.
It contains many specimens which the
Congressional Library does not because
of the fact that it was started by Herbert
Hoover and he was able to obtain tinny
documents and promises of documents
from the European countries which were
not available to others.
