### 
Earl \\ ight, coach of the Blue and
Gold basketball team, has little worry
ing to do over the coming season, ac
cording to reports coming from across
the bay.
The Bruin mentor is so well fixed for
cage veterans that he could afford to
drop two of his first string men off the
squad and still he would have enough
material left to turn out a creditable
team. Only one man, Symes, captain of
last year's quintet, is missing from the
1921 team, and there are two or three
capable men ready to step into his place.
I he California squad took advantage
of the holidays to make a tour of south
ern California, playing about ten games.
They will return to Berkeley in several
days, ready to start their schedule.
Results of the games played by the
Blue and Gold team indicate that Cali
fornia will be represented by a fairly
heavy and fast quintet. Wight's charges
dropped a game to the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, 18 to 14.
