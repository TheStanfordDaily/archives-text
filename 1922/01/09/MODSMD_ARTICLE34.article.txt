# SENIOR SECTION FOR QUAD TO CLOSE SOON
## 
### 
January 25th will be the closing
date for senior photographic records
in the Quad. Due to the increased
difficulty incurred in placing senior
photographs and records together, the
editorial management desires the co
operation of every senior in seeing
that his or her picture and record is
in before the date set.
As only sixteen more days remain
before the senior section will be closed,
the Quad management urges all seni
ors who have not reported to Frank
lin Studio, to do so this week.
