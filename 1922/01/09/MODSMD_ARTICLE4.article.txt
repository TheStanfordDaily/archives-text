# What Ho! Art For Art's Sake; Cheers From the Barbers
## 
### 
Art makes great demands. It culls
for sacrifice. One Stanford woman ha*
heard this call and in answer lias given
up her crowning glory—lias suffered
her flowing treesses to be shorn, cut,
snipped from head. What greater sac
rifice could woman make?
There is a role in "The Charm School"
which Masquers will present a week
from Friday calling for coquettishness.
The woman to whom that part has been
assigned realized that kittenish actions
are more effective with bobbed hair.
Hence the sacrifice —which is only an
other indication that those connected
with the play are not drawing narrow
limits in preparation for a successful
presentation.
