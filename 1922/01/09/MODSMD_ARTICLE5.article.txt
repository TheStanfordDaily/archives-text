# HERTZ ORCHESTRA PLAYS TOMORROW
## Symphony Program Includes Beethoven Selection and Two Operatic Overtures 
### 
The nucleus of the program to be
given by the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra in its last concert tomorrow
evening will be Beethoven's "First
Symphony," and two of the most popu
lar operatic overtures ever written,
namely, "Der Freischutzer" (the "free
shooter"), by Weber, and "The. Merry
Wives of Windsor," by Nicholai.
The former opera was lirst produced
in 1821, and is unique in that it is the
lirst of the school known as the romantic
opera.. The scene is laid in Bohemia.
The music is noted for the atmosphere
of romance and mystery which pervades
the whole work, and the melodies are of
such fine imaginative power that it gave
much inspiration to the young Richard
Wagner.
The story is founded on the tradition
that whoever chose to seek the aid of
Zamiel, the demon huntsman, might, by
selling his soul to him, receive seven
magic bullets which would hit every de
sired mark with unerring accuracy. If
he succeeded in gaining another victim
for the 'lemon, bis own life was ex
tended. Tf lie failed, his life was for
feited. The overture contains many
themes of the opera, including stirring
human hunting choruses, the incanta
tion scene and the beautiful prayer
which opens the overture.
The opening of the "Merry Wives of
Windsor" is based on Shakespeare's
well-known comedy. The number was
played bv the University orchestra in
the Washington's birthday program given
last year.
