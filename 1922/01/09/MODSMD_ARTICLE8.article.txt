# FACULTY APPROVES MINOR CHANGES IN ADMISSION RULES
## High School Students Enabled to Take Advantage of Good Records in Later Courses 
### 
The Stanford faculty has approved
several minor changes in the regulations |
governing admission to the University
and to the Upper Division within the
University which will eliminate some
minor difficulties that have been en
countered in practice.
One of these regulations permits high \
school students to take advantage of
particularly excellent records made in j
the latter part of their high school work
as off-setting earlier work of a poorer !
grade, in entering Stanford 011 the basis
of high school certificates of recommen
dation.

There has been some complaint that ;
Stanford took 110 account of the fact j
that some students who did only fair j
work in the earlier part of their high 1
school course later 011 showed that they I
had developed ability and habits of in- :
dustry which indicated that they would j
make excellent college students. 'I he j
new regulations provide that even if a I
high school student in the first year of :
a continued subject falls below the rec
ommending standard he may be credited
with work of a recommending grade
for all his work in that subject pro
vided he does well enough later to bring
the average for both years up to the
recommending grade.
Furthermore, Stanford, by this new
provision, will acct.pt credentials upon
the basis of a student's record during
his last two years in high school pro
vided all the unites of these two years
are of recommending grade and not
more than three of the units in the first
two years are below recommending
grade and the average of the last two
years is at least live per cent higher
than the recommending grade. Hitherto
a student lias been required to present
the full fifteen units of recommending
grade to secure admission to first-yeai
college standing on the basis of high
school recommendat ion.
Another change in the regulations is
designed to overcome the difficulty which
resulted from the difference between tin 1
number of units of college work re
quired of transfer men students for ad
mission to Stanford in the nc.w re
stricted group and for admission to the
Upper Division. The previous rule has
been that men students who had ad
vanced standing amounting to sixty
seven hours of college work, which is
practically a year and one-half, would
be admitted without restriction with re
gard to numbers, while only 450 men
students with less, than that amount of
work to their credit would be admitted
in the autumn quarter and fifty each for
the other quarters. Men transferring
from other colleges were admitted to
the Upper Division at Stanford only if.
in the judgment of the Committee on
Lower Division, they had met all the
Stanford Lower Division requirements
Hereafter such transfer students will
be automatically admitted to the Upper
Division if they have eighty or more
units of advanced credit or if, in the
opinion of the. Committee on Advanced
Standing, they have completed courses
equivalent to Stanford's Lower Division
requirements, and likewise, the line of
demarkation for admission of men stu
dents from other universities outside
the numerically restricted group is
placed at eighty hours instead of sixty
seven. By inspection of the records of
past years it is found that this increase
of required hours will affect an exceed
ingly small number of prospective can
didates for admission under these regu
lations. Last year the total number
who might have been affected was only
five.
The faculty has removed the restric
tion which prevented any students from
taking more than eight edn hours of
work in a quarter without special per
mission by the Committee on Registra
tion. Hereafter any student with an
average record in the University, of a
grade of B or better, may register for
as many units in excess of eighteen as
shall be approved by the Lower Division
Committee, if he is in the Lower Divi
sion, or by his major department if he |
is in the Upper Division. For students j
with less than a B average the old regu- j
lation is retained. This regulation is |
designed to remove any hindrance upon
superior students who have showed
their ability to carry more than the
eighteen hours which is regarded as a
normal maximum for average students.
