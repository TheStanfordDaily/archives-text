# COACHES ISSUE CALL FOR DIAMOND SQUAD
## Seven Veterans Are Out For Places on Varsity Nineâ€” Draper and Green Return 
### 
Baseball Manager Ford M. Tussing
has sent out the first call for baseball
candidates, and the men will sign up
with Coaches Seay and Kallam at the
gym this afternoon.
With this announcement the Cardinal
baseball season is under way. As a nu
cleus for his varsity squad, Coach Seay
has a number of his veterans to lead
off with. Guy Draper, Seay's best bet
last year 011 the pitching mound, is back
on the job and in good condition. Nef
and Kelly, men who gave creditable ac
counts of themselves last season in the
heaving position, are ready to put 011
the uniforms.
Captain George Green, a man who
demonstrated his ability last season as
pitcher, catcher, and outfielder, is prob
ably the headiest and mo-t finished
player 011 the squad. Green's work
with the stick is above the 300 mark,
and lias been a life-saver in the pinches.
For the inner lot, Coach Seay has
Patterson. Heekendorf. Peavy. Maillot,
and Ratner. Last season Patterson had
little trouble in holding his berth around
the initial sack area. With the return
of Ratner. first-sacker on the 1920 squad,
there will undoubtedly be some keen
competition for the job.
"Lefty" Heekendorf is the nifty little
third-sacker who handled his territory
last season with all the ease and grace
of a veteran. Peavy took care of the
keystone last year and seldom failed to
deliver the goods when the occasion de
manded. Maillot is the man who will
run any new candidates a hard race for
the shortstop territory. His stick work
is a little weak and i? the one count
against him.
In the outfield. Carver and Wayland
are the only last year men to return.
Mort Kline, the best outfielder on the
1921 squad, has graduated and will not
answer the roll call.
From last year's freshman squad,
Seay will draw Woodward, Bonner,
Lowenstein, Smurr, Colvin, and prob
ably several others.
Floyd Kallam, captain of the 1920
squad, and one of the best second base
men of Cardinal diamond history, i- to
direct the destiny of this year's freshman
squad. There is no way of guessing
how many of the first-year men will
answer Tussing's call this afternoon, but,
given a creditable number of men to
work with, Kallam is capable of turn
ing out a team which will give a good
account of itself.
Men not signing up on either of the
squads this afternoon should see Tus
sing tomorrow or as soon as possible.
The Hoard of Athletic Control has
arranged with Johnny Couch, formerly
a member of the Stanford baseball
team and now pitcher of the San Fran
cisco Seals, to help in the coaching of
the Stanford pitchers this season.
Couch will spend a month or more
with the squad before he joins the
Seals for their preliminary practice. .
