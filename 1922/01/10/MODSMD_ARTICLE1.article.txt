# NEW MOTOR RULE IS PRESENTED BY DEAN MARY YOST
## New Women Welcomed at Assembly; Mary Mathews and Carey Bailard Speak 
### 
Ihe tirst all-women's assembly that
has been held at Stanford for several
years was called this morning and the
response on the. part of the live hundred
was almost uanimous.
Dean Mary Yost was the principal
speaker at the meeting and put before
the women students a number of new
and helpful ideas regarding their or
ganization as a body and its part in the
activities of the University. She de
clared that the success of the work car
ried on by the Associated Women could
only result from considering the Uni
versity as a vital, growing organiza
tion, which embodies comradship and
co-operation as well as class room work,
and involves every interest of student
life.
Dean Yost read to the women the new
version of the highway motor rule as
it stands since its revision in December,
and explained its various clauses and
the reasons why Women's Council and
the Committee on Student Affairs de
cided that this wording of the rule was
most satisfactory.
The provisions of the rule as read by
Miss Yost, are as follows:
"There shall be no motoring unchap
eroiled after dark by any undergraduate
woman student who has been in resi
dence at Stanford less than three quar
ters, except as a means of conveyance
directly between her home and the cam
pus or Palo Alto and the campus.
"Tn case of undergraduate transfers
who have completed one year or more
in some other university this rule shall
apply for one quarter.
"Stanford women, unless they are un
der the immediate jurisdiction of their
parents or guardian, shall not attend off
campus public dances except in Palo
Alto nor enter places of public resort."
Tt is necessary, in adopting this motor
rule, that those whom it affects should
realize the spirit of it and work toward
its success, in order that at the end of
the three-year trial which it is to be
given, its merits or deficiencies may be
realized and its evils remedied, said Miss
Yost. In this way the student organi
zation will be successful in building up
for itself standards of conduct that will
regulate its actions in the most satisfac
tory and effective manner.
Mary Mathews, president of the As
sociated Women Students, spoke for a
few moments regarding the fostering of
group activity among the five hundred.
After setting forth the various branches
of activity in which the women students
have, an opportunity to take part, she
brought out the importance of inter
ested group action on their part in or
der to accomplish what every branch
of work they may undertake. Strength
of organization is the basis of all group
progress, and Miss Mathews pointed out
that this must he the first and outstand
ing fact for Stanford women to re
member. Then, and then only, may they
hope to make a lasting and impression
able contribution to the life of the Uni
versity.
Carey Bailard. president of Women's
Athletic Association, was the. conclud
ing speaker of the assembly. She rep
resented to the students the various
forms of athletics which are open to
women at Stanford, and voiced the ne
cessity of enlisting the entire interest
of the five hundred in this field of ac
tivity in order that the women may
make athletics as important and as vital
a part of their student life as do the
women of other universities. She also
spoke of the pageant which is being
planned by the women students to he
given sometime during the spring quar
ter, and in which there will be afforded
an opportunity for every member of the
five hundred to contribute her share of
interested effort.

versity as a vital, growing organiza
tion, which embodies comradship and
co-operation as well as class room work,
and involves every interest of student
life.
Dean Yost read to the women the new
version of the highway motor rule as
it stands since its revision in December,
and explained its various clauses and
the reasons why Women's Council and
the Committee on Student Affairs de
cided that this wording of the rule was
most satisfactory.
The provisions of the rule as read by
Miss Yost, are as follows:
"There shall be no motoring unchap
eroiled after dark by any undergraduate
woman student who has been in resi
dence at Stanford less than three quar
ters, except as a means of conveyance
directly between her home and the cam
pus or Palo Alto and the campus.
"Tn case of undergraduate transfers
who have completed one year or more
in some other university this rule shall
apply for one quarter.
"Stanford women, unless they are un
der the immediate jurisdiction of their
parents or guardian, shall not attend off
campus public dances except in Palo
Alto nor enter places of public resort."
Tt is necessary, in adopting this motor
rule, that those whom it affects should
realize the spirit of it and work toward
its success, in order that at the end of
the three-year trial which it is to be
given, its merits or deficiencies may be
realized and its evils remedied, said Miss
Yost. In this way the student organi
zation will be successful in building up
for itself standards of conduct that will
regulate its actions in the most satisfac
tory and effective manner.
Mary Mathews, president of the As
sociated Women Students, spoke for a
few moments regarding the fostering of
group activity among the five hundred.
After setting forth the various branches
of activity in which the women students
have, an opportunity to take part, she
brought out the importance of inter
ested group action on their part in or
der to accomplish what every branch
of work they may undertake. Strength
of organization is the basis of all group
progress, and Miss Mathews pointed out
that this must he the first and outstand
ing fact for Stanford women to re
member. Then, and then only, may they
hope to make a lasting and impression
able contribution to the life of the Uni
versity.
Carey Bailard. president of Women's
Athletic Association, was the. conclud
ing speaker of the assembly. She rep
resented to the students the various
forms of athletics which are open to
women at Stanford, and voiced the ne
cessity of enlisting the entire interest
of the five hundred in this field of ac
tivity in order that the women may
make athletics as important and as vital
a part of their student life as do the
women of other universities. She also
spoke of the pageant which is being
planned by the women students to he
given sometime during the spring quar
ter, and in which there will be afforded
an opportunity for every member of the
five hundred to contribute her share of
interested effort.
Ihe tirst all-women's assembly that
has been held at Stanford for several
years was called this morning and the
response on the. part of the live hundred
was almost uanimous.
Dean Mary Yost was the principal
speaker at the meeting and put before
the women students a number of new
and helpful ideas regarding their or
ganization as a body and its part in the
activities of the University. She de
clared that the success of the work car
ried on by the Associated Women could
only result from considering the Uni
versity as a vital, growing organiza
tion, which embodies comradship and
co-operation as well as class room work,
and involves every interest of student
life.
