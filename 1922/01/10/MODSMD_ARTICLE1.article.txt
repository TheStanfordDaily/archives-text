# NEW MOTOR RULE IS PRESENTED BY DEAN MARY YOST
## New Women Welcomed at Assembly; Mary Mathews and Carey Bailard Speak 
### 
Ihe tirst all-women's assembly that
has been held at Stanford for several
years was called this morning and the
response on the. part of the live hundred
was almost uanimous.
Dean Mary Yost was the principal
speaker at the meeting and put before
the women students a number of new
and helpful ideas regarding their or
ganization as a body and its part in the
activities of the University. She de
clared that the success of the work car
ried on by the Associated Women could
only result from considering the Uni
versity as a vital, growing organiza
tion, which embodies comradship and
co-operation as well as class room work,
and involves every interest of student
life.
Dean Yost read to the women the new
version of the highway motor rule as
it stands since its revision in December,
and explained its various clauses and
the reasons why Women's Council and
the Committee on Student Affairs de
cided that this wording of the rule was
most satisfactory.
The provisions of the rule as read by
Miss Yost, are as follows:
"There shall be no motoring unchap
eroiled after dark by any undergraduate
woman student who has been in resi
dence at Stanford less than three quar
ters, except as a means of conveyance
directly between her home and the cam
pus or Palo Alto and the campus.
"Tn case of undergraduate transfers
who have completed one year or more
in some other university this rule shall
apply for one quarter.
"Stanford women, unless they are un
der the immediate jurisdiction of their
parents or guardian, shall not attend off
campus public dances except in Palo
Alto nor enter places of public resort."
Tt is necessary, in adopting this motor
rule, that those whom it affects should
