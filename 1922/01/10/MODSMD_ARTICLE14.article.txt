# Nestoria Declines to Offer New Subject For Inter-Society Debate
## 
### 
Nestoria voted to decline submitting
a new question to Fuphronia for the
annual debate, at a special meeting last
night. The present question is the sales
tax, the subject of the tri-state debate,
and because of this Nestoria members
of the team chosen for this contest did
not vote.
Speakers at the meeting expressed the
hope that Kuphronia would accept the
present question, so that a high-class de
bate between men of varsity caliber
could be given. They said that Nestoria
was fully justified morally and legally
in refusing to offer another question,
and added that if Fuphronia refused
the subject Nestoria will claim a for
feit under the rules of the California
Debating Societies League.
Announcement was made that there
will be no meeting tomorrow because
of the basketball game.
