# TRAINING TABLE FOR BASKETBALL VARSITY STARTS
## Eighteen Men to Eat Evening Meal at El Toro; Cardinal Squad Prepares for Saints 
### 
Eighteen members of the Cardinal
varsity basketball squad will take tin.ir
evening meal hereafter at the training
table established at El Toro Club, ad
joining Encina Hall, Coach Gene Van
Gent announced last night.
1 The men on the training table at pres
lent are: Captain Da vies, Rogers, Rich
niond, Janssen, I )<j Groot, McHo-e,
Neer, Gerson, G. Smith, Pollard, Cul
thurst, Pitts, Cleveland, Campbell, llo
well, Hood, Larson, and Anderson.
The varsity squad is putting two
hours Of stiff practice every day from
14:30 to 6:30, and the evening meal at
lEI Toro will be served at 6:45. Later
I in the evening Van Gent will probably
devote some of the time to discussion
of the theoretical -ide of basketball, out
lining various plays for the Cardinal
five.
The Cardinal mentor lost no time l.'st
night in starting a fast game between
two fives picked from the first squad.
The contest lasted about an hour and a
quarter, and every man on the squad
I got in the fray for at least a few min
| utes. Van Gent kept interchanging
j players, and the original fives were soon
replaced by others.
The combination that seemed to work
the best, however, was the one Van
Gent started as the varsity quintet. Cap
tain Davies and Rogers held down the
forward positions, with Janssen, lanky
skipper of the 1924 basketers, at center.
Richmond was in his old position at
running guard, and De Groot played
| standing guard.
Rogers, who has just returned from
British Columbia with the rugby fifteen,
doesn't seem to have hit his stride of
last year yet. With a few more days'
practice, lie should round into form and
ought to make a good running mate for
the fast and elusive Davies.
"Kip" McHose and Fred Anderson
appeared to good advantage in last
night's workout, lioth .McHose at for
ward and Anderson at running guard
show promise, and with a little more
coaching they ought to be making bids
for places on the first live. McHose is
light, but be is fast and is one of the
surest shots on the, squad.
Dick Faville, guard on the 1921 foot
ball team, lias turned hi> hand to the
court game, and got a chance to play
standing guard in'the practice game. He
is inexperienced, but lias the height,
weight, and reach necessary for the po
sition. It may be that he is the man who
will find Fred Adams' old place, al
though De Groot seems to have the
call on the job now, with Pollard and
Campbell also in the running. Adams,
who had never played basketball until
Rob Evans took him in charge, de
veloped into the best standing guard on
the coast in 1921.

evening meal hereafter at the training
table established at El Toro Club, ad
joining Encina Hall, Coach Gene Van
Gent announced last night.
1 The men on the training table at pres
lent are: Captain Da vies, Rogers, Rich
niond, Janssen, I )<j Groot, McHo-e,
Neer, Gerson, G. Smith, Pollard, Cul
thurst, Pitts, Cleveland, Campbell, llo
well, Hood, Larson, and Anderson.
The varsity squad is putting two
hours Of stiff practice every day from
14:30 to 6:30, and the evening meal at
lEI Toro will be served at 6:45. Later
I in the evening Van Gent will probably
devote some of the time to discussion
of the theoretical -ide of basketball, out
lining various plays for the Cardinal
five.
The Cardinal mentor lost no time l.'st
night in starting a fast game between
two fives picked from the first squad.
The contest lasted about an hour and a
quarter, and every man on the squad
I got in the fray for at least a few min
| utes. Van Gent kept interchanging
j players, and the original fives were soon
replaced by others.
The combination that seemed to work
the best, however, was the one Van
Gent started as the varsity quintet. Cap
tain Davies and Rogers held down the
forward positions, with Janssen, lanky
skipper of the 1924 basketers, at center.
Richmond was in his old position at
running guard, and De Groot played
| standing guard.
Rogers, who has just returned from
British Columbia with the rugby fifteen,
doesn't seem to have hit his stride of
last year yet. With a few more days'
practice, lie should round into form and
ought to make a good running mate for
the fast and elusive Davies.
"Kip" McHose and Fred Anderson
appeared to good advantage in last
night's workout, lioth .McHose at for
ward and Anderson at running guard
show promise, and with a little more
coaching they ought to be making bids
for places on the first live. McHose is
light, but be is fast and is one of the
surest shots on the, squad.
Dick Faville, guard on the 1921 foot
ball team, lias turned hi> hand to the
court game, and got a chance to play
standing guard in'the practice game. He
is inexperienced, but lias the height,
weight, and reach necessary for the po
sition. It may be that he is the man who
will find Fred Adams' old place, al
though De Groot seems to have the
call on the job now, with Pollard and
Campbell also in the running. Adams,
who had never played basketball until
Rob Evans took him in charge, de
veloped into the best standing guard on
the coast in 1921.
Eighteen members of the Cardinal
varsity basketball squad will take tin.ir
evening meal hereafter at the training
table established at El Toro Club, ad
joining Encina Hall, Coach Gene Van
Gent announced last night.
