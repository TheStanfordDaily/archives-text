# PHI KAPPA PSI IS WINNER FROM CHI PSI FIVE, 24-10
## 
### 
Phi Kappa Psi defeated Chi Psi last
night in the first intramural basketball
contest of the winter quarter season.
The winning five piled up a 24-10 score.
Roth teams showed high-class ability
in the court game, and Phi Kappa Psi
has an especially strong aggregation,
several of the players looking like, var
sity material. A fast, hard-fought battle
was staged from start to finish. The
contest was featured by short, snappy
passing, with Art Wilcox of the Chi Psi
quintet starring in this department of
the basket game. Wilcox had excellent
form in both passing and receiving the
ball.
Wittenberg, Fish, and Heater formed
the strong combination for Phi Kappa
Psi. Wittenberg was the star player
of the winners and scored half their
total number of points. Fish, who
comes from the Washington and Jef
ferson varsity basketers. played a steady
game at center. Heater was a clever
running-guard.
Wilcox and Ankley <lid most of the
basket-shooting for the Chi Psi live.
The Hays brothers distinguished them
selves as an efficient pair of guards.
Delta Kappa Epsilon and the Com
muters won by forfeit. As soon as the
new pavilion is completed the intramu
ral games will be played in the after
noon, and it is probable that very few
forfeits will occur.
