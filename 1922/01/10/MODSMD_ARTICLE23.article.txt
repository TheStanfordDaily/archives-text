# Decorating for Dances
## 
### 
Campus dances are coming in for a large share of
criticism of late, and rightly so. Elaborateness in
decoration and expensive accessories seem to be the
prime requisites for a successful dance. Unless a
dance is beautifully decorated, unless costly pro
grams are provided, and the lighting is low and vari
colored the dance is not a success.
One result of this tendency in the modern campus
dance is an exorbitant charge; another is the letting
of contracts for the provision of these seemingly
useless accoutrements. The first is usually defended
on the grounds that those who attend dances are will
ing to pay the tax even though it is high. There is
110 defense for the second because there are several
phases of it that do not work to the best interests of
the University.

When a contract is given by the organization put
ting on the dance it immediately opens a way for
graft. If the dance does not measure up to some
other fine affair that preceded it a cry goes up to the
high skies that some one lined his pockets at the ex
pense of the followers of terpsichore. The most ob
jectionable element comes from the use of freshmen
in decorating. The organization while letting the
contract still holds it a matter of duty for the first
year men to aid in the preparation. The freshman is
<1 ragged away from his studies, and he alone is
made to suffer.
The average first-year student never really gets
his feet on solid earth during his first quarter in
Stanford, an A some of them never have a second
chance to.
ft is enough to ask of the entering student that lie
shall accustom himself to the ways of his new life
without piling a multitude of senseless labors upon
him that prevent him from beginning to fulfill the
purposes which brought him to the University.
