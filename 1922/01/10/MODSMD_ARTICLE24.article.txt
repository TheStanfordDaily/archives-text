# The 						Motor Rule Modified
## 
### 
Women's Council and Conference today presented
to the women of the University the result of their
legislative efforts for last quarter —the modification
of the Motor Rule.
This action is not only an important step in stu
dent self-government but is also one which was
brought about only by the combined working of all
individual members of the Organized Women with
the governing bodies to which they had delegated the
responsibility of making and enforcing their regula
tions.
The present Council and Conference have effected
a reform the need for which has long been felt, and
the new regulation speaks for the ability of the
women to meet and deal with their own problems.
The sane course taken by the governing bodies in
meeting the situation is commendable. Initiative in
the reform came, as it should, from the student body.
The old regulation was not working, and Council,
by securing all possible facts in the case and through
a careful and deliberative process of preparation,
formulated and submitted for University approval
the new modification.
The success of collecting the data and securing
important recommendations was possible only
through the individual effort of all those concerned.
The women last year cooperated as a unit in this
respect, and the spirit in which they attempted to
effect better student legislation and control is an in
dication of the way in which they will accept the
Motor Rule and work together for its success.
The spirit in which the letter of their law is re
garded by the women will be a further test of the
success of student government as well as proving the
value of the new regulation which enters its three
year period of probation today. M. J. C.
