As a railroad official we highly approve of the Zoology
Club's idea, which appeared in Friday's Daily, about
making the campus and inmmediate vicinity a preserve
for wild life. Since the Hoo Hoo House has changed
its policy and Babylon has started with so bum a road,
there ought to be some nearby resort for campus parties
and the immediate vicinity might as well be acknowl
edged now as later.
* * *
The women ought to be for it. With action so near
home the percentage of the wild lifers who could be
tamed will be greatly increased.
* * *
Who belongs to the Zoology Club, anyhow?

Letters have been flooding the office from worried
readers. Here's one:
Dear Cabbages:—l view with alarm the suggestion of
the Animal Association that the campus be a preserve
for wild life. It is hard enough lor a girl to stay in
college as it is. I wish to go on record as opposing
the movement strenuously. With tuition and other ex
penses steadily on the increase, how is a poor Los Altos
bootlegger's daughter ging to stay in school if people
insist on passing laws like that?
Distressedly,
DEMI JOHNS.

Look at this:
Dear Things—They're crazy, I tell you. It's uncon
stitutional. How can they provide for a place to pre
serve the shy, wild things here on the campus when it
is the inalienable right of mankind to get pickled where
it will?
Kindly see that this is called to the attention of the
Men's Council. Heatedly,
"RED" RACER.

Pretty soon we will feel able to run some of the good
jokes we know. After correcting all of the grammatical
errors we feel that this one deserves space:
Dear Sir:—l wish to express myself as a firm backer
of the Zoology Club's movement to make a nearby pre
serve for wild life. Not only will that science be greatly
benefited, but the philosophy department will be directly
affected, as well as many other schools, no doubt.
My class is at present involved in a very difficult
problem, which, for lack of opportunity for reasoning
from the inductive viewpoint, is causing much trouble.
It would be very simple to solve the problem if there
were such a preserve near at hand.
Mean while, I refer the question to you, "What makes
the Wildcat wild."
Sincerely,
PROFESSOR SOAR.

We will lay that on the table for the present and con
sider the following excerpt from Yakima Republican:
* * »
Yakima's annual observance of "Own
Your Own Toothbrush" week, a nation
al health movement, will begin on Jan
uary 9. Mrs. Georgana O'Brien, school
nurse, is taking the lead in directing the
campaign, during which all children in
the public schools will be taught some
of the fundamental facts of dental hy
giene.
"Many Yakima merchants consider
that the family toothbrush has long ago
disappeared." Mrs. O'Brien says, "but
unfortunately this is not the case. This
forenoon I was in a school room and
as a preparation for next week, asked
all the children who had their own
toothbrush to hold up their hands. One
girl put hers up, but explained that she
used her mother's toothbrush, which
she considered quite as good.
"We aim, during the coming week, to
interest children in dental hygiene and
to provide, if possible, a toothbrush for
every child in the Yakima school sys
tem."
—Yakima Republican.

Next week Cabbages will give the details of an "Own
Your Own Mustache-Cup" campaign. That ought to be
popular with the Engineers, at least. Yes. James, wom
en may register in engineering.
* * *
It looks as if there ie lots of embarrassment due in
Yakima. If .every child is to have a private brush lots
of families will no doubt have to buy a new one for the
shoe-blacking. It ain't right.
• • •
Don't forget: "A Cup For Every Mustache in Stan
ford."

THAT'S A WISE CRACK SAID THE NUT.
