THE FIVE-POWER NAVAL
ARGUMENT DRAFTED
The Five-Power Naval Limitation
Treaty has been drafted and is ready
for publication with a few exceptions
in regard to details and phraseology.
The first article, according to the
resume printed in the San Francisco
Journal, sets forth the "agreement
limiting capital ships to 525,000 tons
each for Great Britain, and the United
States, 315,000 i tons for Japan, and
175,000 tons each for France and for
Italy, establishing a basic ratio of
5-5-3, 1.75, 1.75, respectively.
Two articles provide that the na
tions may assemble and consider a
joint course of action in case of new
scientific and political developments.
This is the portion of the Treaty
which Senator Johnson attacks as the
parallel or Article X of the Covenant
of the League of Nations, and which,
therefore, in his estimation, involves
us in an entangling alliance. This
argument has been ably answered by
Chester Rowell. who said:
"The spirit of suspicion which Sen
ator Johnson seeks to revive would,
if he could instill it in the American
people, make war more inevitable than
a dozen offensive entangling military
alliances."
But there is nothing in the pact
which can be interpreted fairly as an
"entangling military alliance," be
cause the treaty does not obligate us
to go to war under any circumstances
unless we choose to.
The Pact further provides for a ten
year holiday in naval construction.
Certain exceptions to this principle
are made in allowing (1) the United
States to complete two battle-ships
now under contruction; (2) Great
Britain to build two more dread
noughts; (3 and 4) France and Italy
to begin their replacement program
in 1927.
Submarine contruction is not limited
by the pact; but the size and equip
ment of all auxiliary crafts and the
transformation of merchantmen into
war ships are regulated in detail.
Limits are also placed on the aircraft
carrier tonnage and provisions made
for the scrapping of 68 capital ships.
