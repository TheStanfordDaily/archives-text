Congratulations on your splendid edi
torial of Friday, "What's in a Nick
name?" in which you speak of the folly
of calling a wearer of the Cardinal by
any other name. Various futile ',at
tempts have been made to have Stan
ford follow strange gods. The re'eent
Indian suggestion, which has taken hold
|in some quarters, despite the absence
jof official sanction from the Stanford
public, is as ridiculous as the Wahoo
j Bird. Wildcat and Red Lion that pre
i ceded it.
"Stanford —Cardinal —Rah" is all we,
need. By all means let ns advance the
Cardinal as peculiarly symbolical of the
Quad with the red-tiled roofs and the
sunset tires. In this we have been neg
ligent. How many Stanford students
distinguished Cardinal red from crimson
or vermillion? Wc should insist on a
true Cardinal for all athletic equipment,
pennants and regalia. Ihe Stanford
stickers for baggage are even magneta.
some of our athletic sweaters are crim
son. Our one and only, color, our svm
! hoi. is the Cardinal—keep it waving!
