## 
### 
The Stanford Stadium will be the
scene of contests between rugby teams
representing British Columbia and
Stanford within a month or two, if
present plans materialize. The yearly
invasion of Canada by the Cardinal
ruggers has aroused the desire for
the northerners to reciprocate with a
trip here, to see what they can do on
foreign soil.

The Board of Athletic Control has
already taken steps to arrange for
the Vancouver Rugby Union, which is
instrumental in handling rugby affairs
in British Columbia, to send a repre
sentative group of British Columbia
rugby players to Stanford to meet the
Stanford team at some time during
the latter part of February or the
first of March. This would come after
mid-quarter examinations, and a suf

ficient time before finals to allow
planty of time for preparation on the
part of the Cardinal team.
During the trip of the Stanford rug
gers during this Christmas vacation,
when they invaded British Columbia
on their annual tour, the subject of a
trip south by the Canadians was
broached. The Stanford men and the
British Columbians agreed that they
would like to meet again, this time on
the Stanford campus, and Stanford
athletic authorities have authorized an
invitation to the northerners if details
can be arranged.
