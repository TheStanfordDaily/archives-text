# ANDY SMITH, BRUIN FOOTBALL MENTOR, CLOSES SIXTH YEAR
## 
### 
The football season just closed by the
game at Pasadena, on January 2, marks
the end of the sixth year of the Smith
regime at the University of California.

Andy Smith, formerly head coach at
his Alma Mater, the University of
Pennsylvania, and later at Purdue Uni
versity, was secured for the Berkeley
institution mainly through the efforts of
Johnnie Stroud, then graduate manager.
California was reverting to the Ameri
can game in 1910, and Stroud was sent
East to look for a coach.

The first four seasons were lean years
for the man now hailed as one of the
greatest football coaches in the country.
Smith's teams always mjet some set
back, and they went down to defeat reg
ularly at the hands of at least one of
the elevens from the North.

It was 1920 before Smith really put
out a team that was anything phenomi
nal; the predecessors had been more or
less mediocre. The Bruin varsity of
1920 was oue of the best, if not the
best, in the country.
Fortune smiled upon the lanky Bruin
mentor again in 1921, although not to so
great a degree. His team of the past
season hardly reached the heights at
tained by the varsity of 1920. The ten
dency from the day when California
beat Ohio State, 28 to 0, lias been down
ward rather than upward.
Smith has no easy task ahead of him
in 1922. All that will remain of the
line of the "wonder team" will be Mid
ler and Rerkey. and perhaps Clark. The
seventh year for Andy Smith will be
harder than any of the first six. for
this time he has a reputation to maintain.
