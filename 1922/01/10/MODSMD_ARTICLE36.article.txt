OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, Corvallis, Jan. 9. (P. I. N. S.) —
A pennant contender is the prediction
of basketball fans at O. A. C., for the
varsity team this season. The team
showed up well in winning all five of
its holiday barnstorming games and
good material is certainly available.
Although only three lettermen are
contenders for varsity berths the new
men seem to be filling the vacancies
in great shape. Hjelte, the elongated
center, who proved the outstanding
star of the barnstorming games, is
counted on for doing much towards
keeping the Aggie team in the run
ning.
The showing made in the barnstorm
ing trip was considered remarkable.
Never was the five in danger of defeat
and furthermore with but one excep
tion the opposing teams were held
scoreless in the first half when the
regular quintet was on the floor. Later
in the contest substitutes were put in
so that the coaches could look over
additional material. The hardest game
was with the team of the Columbia
Athletic Club of Astoria, the result
being a 30 to 16 victory. The Astoria
five, considered an especially fast
group, defeated the University of Ore
gon varsity team 30 to 18 the night
before the Aggie game.
