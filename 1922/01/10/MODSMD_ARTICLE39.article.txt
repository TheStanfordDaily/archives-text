Returns from the Y. W. C. A. drive
show only one house with a 100 per
cent contribution, although the low
standing of several houses is due to
their inability to reach their commuters.
About 100 commuters have not been
heard from. The Y. \V. C. \. asked
for $450. ;m(! to date the. contributions
amount to approximately $.300: $50
more is expected, bringing the total to
$350. If the full quota is not raised the
Y. W. C. A. will have to operate 011 a
much smaller budget than the work re
quires. The percentages of the women'*
living groups arc:
