### 
"There is a red line to history. There
I is a meaning in history."
| "Summon your own history. Make
I your own heroism."
"There are some people, to whom
much lias been given—and much shall
be required."
"There is practically nobody in this
| audience who is more than a few hun
-1 dred years this side of serfdom."
".Men can afford to be exceedingly
j humble in the face of the perplexities
i that confront the world today."
J. Stitt Wilson, in the third of his se
! ries of five talks on the Stanford cam
pus. delivered last night in the Assembly
' Hall, dwelt especially upon how the
! misuse of control and administration
I pertaining to religious institutions, gov
ernmental institutions, persons, and,
lately, property, by selfish people, for
i their own pride and ambition, has
brought the affairs of the world to a
crisis.
"I am not sure," said Wilson, "but
that the world is facing a dark age.
; Science, history, art, philosophy, and
| revelation —no one of them can solve
alone the world problems; they must
!be taken all together. The church can
j not solve the problem of the world by
I dealing exclusively with the religious
j side. I don't believe politics will solve
the problem."
"Mutual aid instead of mutual assas
j sination," he gave as the priniiple that
! should guide the world (nit of its trou
bles today. "The idea that there is
nothing but a tierce struggle for ex
istence is a misreading of the life of
| every living creature. The struggle for
j and with others for the common good
is the principle that overcomes the mere
struggle for self. That is the gospel
of science, and 1 defy its contradiction."
Unless we revise our idea of the rules
jof nature, he continued, "we are get
ting ready for another leap into a
chasm of human horror."
Wilson outlined the various forms
which abuse of religious institutions,
governmental institutions, persons and
property, have taken in the past. "The
essence of governmental tyranny," he
said, "has been the seizure of the use
of the governmental principle by in
dividuals for their own use, and pride,
and extravagance, and ambition." Wil
son pointed out how, although anti
slavery agitation started far back in the
world's history, it could make no prog
ress until religious and governmental
liberty had been established.

".Men can afford to be exceedingly
j humble in the face of the perplexities
i that confront the world today."
J. Stitt Wilson, in the third of his se
! ries of five talks on the Stanford cam
pus. delivered last night in the Assembly
' Hall, dwelt especially upon how the
! misuse of control and administration
I pertaining to religious institutions, gov
ernmental institutions, persons, and,
lately, property, by selfish people, for
i their own pride and ambition, has
brought the affairs of the world to a
crisis.
"I am not sure," said Wilson, "but
that the world is facing a dark age.
; Science, history, art, philosophy, and
| revelation —no one of them can solve
alone the world problems; they must
!be taken all together. The church can
j not solve the problem of the world by
I dealing exclusively with the religious
j side. I don't believe politics will solve
the problem."
"Mutual aid instead of mutual assas
j sination," he gave as the priniiple that
! should guide the world (nit of its trou
bles today. "The idea that there is
nothing but a tierce struggle for ex
istence is a misreading of the life of
| every living creature. The struggle for
j and with others for the common good
is the principle that overcomes the mere
struggle for self. That is the gospel
of science, and 1 defy its contradiction."
Unless we revise our idea of the rules
jof nature, he continued, "we are get
ting ready for another leap into a
chasm of human horror."
Wilson outlined the various forms
which abuse of religious institutions,
governmental institutions, persons and
property, have taken in the past. "The
essence of governmental tyranny," he
said, "has been the seizure of the use
of the governmental principle by in
dividuals for their own use, and pride,
and extravagance, and ambition." Wil
son pointed out how, although anti
slavery agitation started far back in the
world's history, it could make no prog
ress until religious and governmental
liberty had been established.
