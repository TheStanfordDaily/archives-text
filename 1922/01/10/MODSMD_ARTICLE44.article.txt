# LIGHTWEIGHT COURT SQUAD WILL START PRACTICE AT ONCE
## 
### 
Lightweight basketball practice started
yesterday afternoon under the direction
of VV. W. Young, '23, who was respon
sible for the successful showing of la-t
year's team. The regular coach lias not
been finally agreed upon yet and in the
meantime Young will do the bossing.

All of last year's team have returned.
.Milt Hogle, '23, is ready to take his place
at center again. Joe Silviera. '22, and
YV. VV, Young, '23, are working out in
the guard berths, and Fred Koba, '24,
the fast forward whose dribbling was
one of the features of the Cal games
last year, is playing with the varsity
squad for the time being. Hollings
worth, '23. at the other forward position,
will be out tonight in a suit.

Fifty other candidates were signed up
for lightweight basketball at the end of
last quarter. The team plays under a
130-pound limit, but men weighing more
than that are asked to come out in the
hope that they may be able to reduce
their weight. .Manager J. 15. Sansome is
working for athletic awards for the
lightweight tossers, and as the possibil
ities for an even more successful sea
son than last year's develop, lie says that
he grows confident of sweaters.

A schedule is in the making which
includes but one sure game besides the
California series. The team will meet
the Palo Alto High School as a pre
liminary to the Washington State clash.
There are possibilities for arranging
with San Mateo and St. Ignatius before
long.
If a satisfactory schedule can be fixed
by the Pacific Athletic Association, the
130-pounders will probably enter the
championship tournament in San Fran
cisco along toward the end of the season.
