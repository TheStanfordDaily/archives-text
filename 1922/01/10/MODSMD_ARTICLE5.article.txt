# BABE BASKET TEAM TO PLAY PALO ALTO WEDNESDAY EVENING
## 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay's freshman court
team will face the Palo Alto High
School live in the first game of the. sea
son Wednesday evening in the Encina
gymnasium. The game will serve as
a preliminary to the varsity game and
will begin at 7:15.
Although Palo Alto does not rank
very, high in peninsula basketball cir
cles, they are a fast, accurate aggrega
tion, and should furnish some close
competition for the first-year men. They
are coached by Howard Ray, who was
a star forward of the Oregon Aggies'
five in 'IS and '16.
Coach Seay has been holding short
practice games every afternoon for the
purpose of training the men in playing
together. At present he is seriously
handicapped by the size of the squad,
but a final cut will be made at the end
of next week, and from then on team
work can be developed in a much larger
degree than is now possible.
The average height and vyeight of
this year's squad is greater than last
year's, and the men arc fast, but inac
curacy in basket-shooting nullities most
of this advantage.
Alexander. Hoffman, and Driscoll
appear the most likely candidates for
the forward positions. At center, Mid
dleton, with a successful high school
record, stands out as 'the most expe
rienced player of the squad. "Red'
Macrorie and Dole are showing more
aggressiveness at the guard position
than the other candidates, but there is
no certainty of their filling these po
sitions.
Student body cards will admit to both
the freshmen and varsity games.
