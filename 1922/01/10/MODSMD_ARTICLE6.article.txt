# WILSON SPEAKS TO MEN ON CHANCE TO BENEFIT WORLD
## 
### 
"We are living in an age that may be fraught with great weal or great
woe to the human race."
"You may witness terrific racial conflicts. You will witness some of the
most tragic struggles between labor and capital that this country has ever;
seen."
"We are passing through a period of minor spiritual eclipse in the
world."
"You will be expected to be not merely 100% per cent American, but
100% men."
"What shall it profit a man if he has all the back-push of modern
civilization behind him, and adds nothing to it?"
Speaking to an assembly of all university men, with many people from

outside the campus scattered through
out the audience, J. Stitt Wilson de
livered this morning the fourth of his
series of five talks at Stanford. He
emphasized especially the opportunity
of college students today to he of some
real benefit to the world in helping
to solve its problems.
"All the big things in the world
have been done by young men, or by
old men who were developed when
they were young," Wilson said. "Most
of you will be able to make a great
contribution to the hour in which you
I live."
Wilson showed how the world since
i the coming of Christ has taken on a
j different attitude towards human be
ings than that which it had in pagan
times. "Paganism," he declared, "dis
respected human beings, disregarded
human rights, and then heaped upon
the back of humanity an untold op
pression of toil. Jesus of Nazareth
took the back of History and broke
it. He looked through the unprepos
sessing exterior of human beings that
were left when power got through with
them, and saw â€”what? That the mean
est specimen! of humanity was of in
finite, unparalleled, transcendent con
cern.
"There could be nothing more ap
palling," Wilson continued, "than if

I the keen sensitiveness of the differ-
I ence between right and wrong should
become so blurred that multitudes
would be on shifting sands instead
of on firm grounds.
"Civilization, instead of being a
; progress to exalt the struggle of in
dividual selfishness for its own ends,
irrespective of common good, has been
a steady effort by inekns of revolutions
and uprisings to utilize all possible
means to give a standing ground and
a breathing place for the humblest
human being to evolve his destiny."
The last appearence of Wilson on
the campus in this series of talks he
has been giving comes Wednesday
night, at 7:30, in the Assembly Hall.
At 5:00 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Wilson will hold an open discussion
group for anyone who cares to attend.
It. will be held in the vestry of the
Memorial Church.
