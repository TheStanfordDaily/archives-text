# FRATERNITIES TO MAINTAIN TWO WEEKS' RUSHING
## Proposals Advanced for One or Two Quarters of Rushing Prove Unacceptable 
### 
After a lengthy discussion of the re
lative merits of a rushing season of two
weeks and that of one quarter, the In
terfraternity Conference last night voted
to abide by the present constitution and
to retain the two weeks' period of rush
ing now in effect.
The arguments presented for each
system were substantially the same a
those voiced last week. Those -up
porting the present season said that a
short period would give both the fresh
men and fraternity men an opportunity
to get down to studying. They feel
that a long period of rushing lowers
scholarship standards and caused un
necessary expense. If the freshman is
undecided as to his choice at the end of
two weeks, he need not accept a bid
but may hold out until he has made A
decision.
B. C. Wolford, '18. the representative
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, and H. 11.
Darling, '21. Alpha Delta Phi, did most
of the speaking for the quarter system.
They consider this system as a step to
ward the, type of rushing which permits
the freshman to become established in
the University, before he makes a de
cision as to what he wishes to do.
Heaton Wrenn, president of the con
ference. and representing Phi Delta
Theta, favored a two-quarter system
with pledging in the spring. This plan
he thinks would remove the present in
tensive rushing and would give the
freshman an opportunity to substantiate
himself in the University before he is
bid by a fraternity. Tn case this sys
tc mis deemed inadvisable, renn ap
proves of the two weeks' period of rush-
ing rather than the quarter system,
freshman must take a C average before
he may be initiated was interpreted to
mean that the freshman might make this
average in any quarter before initiation.
This was brought upon account of com
plications arising from summer quarter
work.
Concerning the card system the gen
eral opinion was that it is the privilege
of a house to take, any date that is open.
If a freshman refuses to give an open
date, the house may interpret this to
mean that the freshman will not con
sider pledging such a house.
