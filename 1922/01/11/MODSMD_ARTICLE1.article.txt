# RAM'S HEAD TO INCLUDE UNIQUE IDEAS IN SHOW
## Tryouts Thursday and Friday Give Opportunity for Many Impersonators of Women 
### 
The annual Ram's Head "show next
month will be unusual in every as
pect—plot, lines, cast, settings, music,
lighting. Because of this and the large
number of characters which the play
calls for, the society is extremely anxi
ous that a large number of men, par
ticularly freshmen, appear at the try
outs, which will be held Thursday and
Friday afternoons, from 3 to 5, in the
Assembly Hall, and Thursday evening
from 8 to 10 in the Women's Club
house. About half the cast of forty
are women, providing ample opportun
ity for campus female impersonators.
The action opens in a cubist studio
where are gathered the chief charac
ters —people of the Latin quarter in
a small country of southeastern Eu
rope. The plot, which is 1 woven full !
of mystery and contains three love j
"themes running side by side, ranges !
from the poverty-stricken attic studios |
of the temperamental artists to the |
sumptious palace halls of the reigning!
monarchs.
Everything about the production will !
be unconventional. Modern ideas in j
line with the popular Greenwich Fol-;
lies are introduced. There will be new j
and exotic costumes. The most weird '
stage sets in campus dramatic history
and extraordinary lighting are promis
ed. Even the music will be different.
Cubistic tunes will be introduced to
the Stanford audience. Specialty dan
cing will be a feature, and men light
on their feet will be particularly in
demand.
Les Seib. '22, who will direct the
production, emphasizes the advisability
of appearing early and in large num- j
bers for the first tryouts tomorrow
