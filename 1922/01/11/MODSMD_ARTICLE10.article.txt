# VIVID NUMBERS ARE PRESENTED BY SYMPHONISTS
## Hertz Orchestra Plays "First Symphony" and Overtures In Last Concert of Season 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
It was a mystic spell which Alfred
llertz. tlie wizard conductor of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, cast
over his audience in the last appear
ance of the noted orchestra on th» i
campus for this season. Clearly the
program presented was one arranged by
the ingenious director with a view to
w:irds leaving his hearers in i state of
c.ckantment unr : l his next appearance I
•.o renew tin* c' - arm.
F:om the bright,, intriguing move
men > of Beethoven's "First Sv.npliony"
lo 'he penetiating climax of sot ml in
the final notes of the "Merry V-'i\es of
Windsor" overture, the music was all
of romantic, graceful and frequently
mischievous appeal, imaginative in its
very essence. There was no attempt
to detract from this effect by including
any heavy or complicated element of
composition whatsoever. Kvery selec
tion was entirely in keeping with, the
spirit of the program. The high lights
wc.re gay and scintillating, tlie shadows
impressive, but never too sombre.
The four movements of the Beethoven
"First Symphony" formed the first half
of the program. Full of rythmic charm
and splendid climaxes the number cal'ecl
out a wide range of orchestral ability.
It was played with care as to instrumen-!
tal effect, but with emphasis on the
whimsical, fantastic melodies and the
fascinating gaiety of a central theme,
which led up to a spirited, merry finale.
Hertz handled it in a way to bring out
all the exuberant spirit and graceful
fancies of the work, at the same time i
obscuring none of the intricacies of
j symphonic orchestration.
The second half of the program be
igan vividly with Weber's romantic "Der
I'reischutz" overture. The number is
| one of intriguing originality, embodying
a variety of moods, and is highly pic
'turesque. The. orchestra was accord
ingly afforded opportunity for dexter
ity in interpretation, and the resulting
■ dramatic effect was particularly appeal
j ing. One of the most delightful num
bers was an arrangement by Arensky of
"Variations on a 1 scbaikowskv Theme
for string orchestra. Here a wider range
of treatment was possible in the va
rious moods of the piece. It was a
beautiful exhibition of the. resources of
string instruments as well as coinciding
in theme with the general tone of the
other numbers.
A number of short "dances" from the
"Nut Cracker Suite" of Tscbaikowskv
formed a series of charming and color
ful pictures, and proved one of the
most enthusiastically received numbers
of the evening. F.acli of the dances was
individualized and the more striking for
that reason. The number included a
stirring march, a "Dance of the Pee
Dragee," a Russian, an Arabian, and a
Chinese dance, and a concluding "Dance
of the Mirlitons." Every movement had
its own characteristic melody, each con
trasting in treatment. Novelty was add
ed to the. "Fee Dragee" by the use of
the "celeste." an unusual instrument pro
ducing bell-like tones, which carried the
melody.
Nicholai's overture 1o the "Merry
Wives of Windsor" formed a pictur
esque and spirited close to the program.
It is excellent in orchestration and
abounds in graceful turns and captivat
ing melody. The music reflects the
spirit of the famous comedy and the.
leading theme is developed step by step
through a maze of inventive melodies to
an exhilarating finale in which the en
tire orchestra combines to create a pow
erful crescendo.

It is excellent in orchestration and
abounds in graceful turns and captivat

spirit of the famous comedy and the.
leading theme is developed step by step
through a maze of inventive melodies to
an exhilarating finale in which the en

It was a mystic spell which Alfred

the final notes of the "Merry V-'i\es of
Windsor" overture, the music was all
of romantic, graceful and frequently
mischievous appeal, imaginative in its
very essence. There was no attempt
to detract from this effect by including
any heavy or complicated element of
composition whatsoever. Kvery selec

spirit of the program. The high lights

impressive, but never too sombre.
The four movements of the Beethoven
"First Symphony" formed the first half
of the program. Full of rythmic charm
and splendid climaxes the number cal'ecl
out a wide range of orchestral ability.
It was played with care as to instrumen-!
tal effect, but with emphasis on the
whimsical, fantastic melodies and the
fascinating gaiety of a central theme,
which led up to a spirited, merry finale.
Hertz handled it in a way to bring out
all the exuberant spirit and graceful
fancies of the work, at the same time i
obscuring none of the intricacies of

a variety of moods, and is highly pic
'turesque. The. orchestra was accord

"Variations on a 1 scbaikowskv Theme
for string orchestra. Here a wider range
of treatment was possible in the va

string instruments as well as coinciding

other numbers.
A number of short "dances" from the
"Nut Cracker Suite" of Tscbaikowskv
formed a series of charming and color

most enthusiastically received numbers
of the evening. F.acli of the dances was
individualized and the more striking for
that reason. The number included a
stirring march, a "Dance of the Pee
Dragee," a Russian, an Arabian, and a
Chinese dance, and a concluding "Dance
of the Mirlitons." Every movement had
its own characteristic melody, each con
trasting in treatment. Novelty was add
