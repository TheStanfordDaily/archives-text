son will address the university stu
dents and faculty and all others who
care, to attend at an all-univenuty
meeting tonight in the Assembly Hall,
at 8:00.
Wilson has delivered" four of his
series of five talks, starting with his
address in the Memorial Church last
Sunday, and continuing with speeches
Sunday night, Monday night, and Tues
day morning, in the Assembly Hall.
All of his talks have drawn crowds,
not only from among the students, but
from people outside the campus.
The five talks he gives are corre
lated to each other, each one develop
ing further the fundamental ideas with
which he started the basis of his dis
cussions. These lectures are in effect
the same that he has delivered with
success throughout more than a hun

United States. During the last two
years, Wilson's time has been taken
up mostly with addresses that he has
delivered to college students all over
the country.
For those who wish the opportunity
to acquire a more intimate acquaint
ance with him, Wilson is holding the
last of his "open forum sessions" this
afternoon, in the Chapel of the Me
morial Church. The time has been
changed from 4 o'clock to 5 o'clock.
All who are interested are invited to
come for a short informal discussion.
