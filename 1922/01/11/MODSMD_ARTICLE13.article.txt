# BABE BASKET TEAM PLAYS FIRST GAME OF SEASON TONIGHT
## 
### 
Basket shooting and a few simple
! plays occupied the attention of Coach
i Duffy Seay and his freshman basket
squad, yesterday afternoon. Practice
games were abandoned in order to con
dition the men for their first game
of the season with Palo Alto High
| tonight on the local court.
Coach Seay divided the squad into
I two groups, and devoted most of the
! afternoon in selecting the two best
j teams, and the men who will start
I the game tonight. At present J. D.
Middleton, who registers from Phoe
; nix, Arizona, seems to be the fastest
and most accurate man on the floor.
| He will undoubtedly start at center,
j Steele and Logan are also good men
i who show promise of developing into
I speedy centers, and both have a
! chance to play before the evening is
| over.
Tom Alexander, who received his
training from A. A. Kelleher, of Prin
ceton. and William Hoffman, have
i developed an ability to work together
at forward position, and they will
' probably start the game. Driscoll,
Shipke and Soleman were selected to
complete the list of basket men.
The Palo Alto team will ha*ve the
disadvantage of being outweighed
heavily, but Howard Ray, who play
, ed forward on the Oregon Aggie team
i in '15, is coaching them, and Ray has
a reputation for taking every advant
age of his material. He has turned
J out a fairly fast team, but as they
have been playing on an outdoor court,
ihe slippery condition of the Encina
1 court may hinder them to some ex
| tent.
The freshman game will begin
| promptly at 7:15, and student body
I cards are good for admittance.
A change in the freshman schedule
has been announced by Earnest Wil
son, '22. basketball manager. The
game on Saturday, January 14, could
not be secured with San Jose High
] School, but Commerce High has been
I scheduled for that date.
