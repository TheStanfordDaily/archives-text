# PLANS FOR THREE MILLION DOLLAR ENDOWMENT FUND CAMPAIGN ARE ANNOUNCED
## Executive Committee Will Take Leadership in Drive on Campus 
### 
Characterizing the endowment campaign as "the most significant and
most important thing Stanford has ever done," Lyman L. Pierce, director of
Stanford's three million dollar endowment campaign outlined plans for the
drive at the regular meeting of the Executive Comittee last night.
According to the plan as set forth by Mr. Pierce, the campaign is to
start with, and hinge around the drive on the campus. Immediately follow
ing the opening of the drive on the campus, Santa Clara County will be can
vassed. Next, San Mateo and San Francisco counties will be reached, and
from there the campaign will proceed south to Los Angeles and San Diego.
The drive on the coast will close in Washington and Oregon, and will then
be carried eastward by states. More than 11,000 alumni will be reached dur
ing the progress of the campaign.
Mr. Pierce pointed out the extreme need for an increase of the present
endowment, traced the beginning of the shortage back to the time of the
late war when Stanford was in a very poor financial condition. "The institu-

tion of tuition was a severe test of the
loyalty of the undergraduates of Stan
ford," he said. He showed that the
I tuition system lias not entirely solved
the problem by pointing to the fact
I that in the last two years, the Comp
| troller's Records show a $200,000 de
| fleit.
"Stanford's entire future program is
endangered by the present shortage of
| funds," said Mr. Pierce. "Harvard,
| with an endowment approximately the
j same size as Stanford's, raised $18,-
| 000,000, and we are attempting to raise
, only $3,000,000. The alumni of Stan
ford need to be jarred, and the best
place to start the awakening is light
here on the campus."
Mr. Sarcka who is assisting Mr.
Pierce in the campaign also spoke to
the Committee, emphasizing the neces
sity of intensive organization on the
campus, and referring to the campaign
as a part of college curriculum.
In accordance with Mr. Pierce's sug
, gestion, the campaign on the campus
I will be handled by the Executive Com
mittee. Dan Evans, '20, President of
! the Associated Students, is taking
charge of the drive here and has ap

Characterizing the endowment campaign as "the most significant and
most important thing Stanford has ever done," Lyman L. Pierce, director of
Stanford's three million dollar endowment campaign outlined plans for the
drive at the regular meeting of the Executive Comittee last night.
According to the plan as set forth by Mr. Pierce, the campaign is to
start with, and hinge around the drive on the campus. Immediately follow
ing the opening of the drive on the campus, Santa Clara County will be can
vassed. Next, San Mateo and San Francisco counties will be reached, and
from there the campaign will proceed south to Los Angeles and San Diego.
The drive on the coast will close in Washington and Oregon, and will then
be carried eastward by states. More than 11,000 alumni will be reached dur
ing the progress of the campaign.
Mr. Pierce pointed out the extreme need for an increase of the present
endowment, traced the beginning of the shortage back to the time of the
late war when Stanford was in a very poor financial condition. "The institu-

tion of tuition was a severe test of the
loyalty of the undergraduates of Stan
ford," he said. He showed that the
I tuition system lias not entirely solved
the problem by pointing to the fact
I that in the last two years, the Comp
| troller's Records show a $200,000 de
| fleit.
"Stanford's entire future program is
endangered by the present shortage of
| funds," said Mr. Pierce. "Harvard,
| with an endowment approximately the
j same size as Stanford's, raised $18,-
| 000,000, and we are attempting to raise
, only $3,000,000. The alumni of Stan
ford need to be jarred, and the best
place to start the awakening is light
here on the campus."
Mr. Sarcka who is assisting Mr.
Pierce in the campaign also spoke to
the Committee, emphasizing the neces
sity of intensive organization on the
campus, and referring to the campaign
as a part of college curriculum.
In accordance with Mr. Pierce's sug
, gestion, the campaign on the campus
I will be handled by the Executive Com
mittee. Dan Evans, '20, President of
! the Associated Students, is taking
charge of the drive here and has ap

Characterizing the endowment campaign as "the most significant and
most important thing Stanford has ever done," Lyman L. Pierce, director of
Stanford's three million dollar endowment campaign outlined plans for the
drive at the regular meeting of the Executive Comittee last night.
According to the plan as set forth by Mr. Pierce, the campaign is to
start with, and hinge around the drive on the campus. Immediately follow
ing the opening of the drive on the campus, Santa Clara County will be can
vassed. Next, San Mateo and San Francisco counties will be reached, and
from there the campaign will proceed south to Los Angeles and San Diego.
The drive on the coast will close in Washington and Oregon, and will then
be carried eastward by states. More than 11,000 alumni will be reached dur
ing the progress of the campaign.
Mr. Pierce pointed out the extreme need for an increase of the present
endowment, traced the beginning of the shortage back to the time of the
late war when Stanford was in a very poor financial condition. "The institu-

tion of tuition was a severe test of the
loyalty of the undergraduates of Stan
ford," he said. He showed that the
I tuition system lias not entirely solved
the problem by pointing to the fact
I that in the last two years, the Comp
| troller's Records show a $200,000 de
| fleit.
"Stanford's entire future program is
endangered by the present shortage of
| funds," said Mr. Pierce. "Harvard,
| with an endowment approximately the
j same size as Stanford's, raised $18,-
| 000,000, and we are attempting to raise
, only $3,000,000. The alumni of Stan
ford need to be jarred, and the best
place to start the awakening is light
here on the campus."
Mr. Sarcka who is assisting Mr.
Pierce in the campaign also spoke to
the Committee, emphasizing the neces
sity of intensive organization on the
campus, and referring to the campaign
as a part of college curriculum.
In accordance with Mr. Pierce's sug
, gestion, the campaign on the campus
I will be handled by the Executive Com
mittee. Dan Evans, '20, President of
! the Associated Students, is taking
