# EL CAPITAN SCORES 15-5 ON ZETA PSI
## 
### 
El Capitan's basket quintet scored a
15 to 5 victory over Zeta Psi in last j
nights intramural contest.
I
Superior ability on the part of the
El Capitan men made the outcome
evident from the first. At the end of
the first half, the score was 13 to ,1. i
In the next period, however, the Zeta |
Psi players allowed their opponents
to make only one basket.
Fehren, Strauss, and Walker formed J
Iho scoring combine for El Capitan.!
They displayed consistent teamwork |
and tossed some good shots. Fehren j
dropped the ball *hrough the net four j
times. Strauss made a pair of baskets
and one free throw, while Walker;
hung up two tallies. Wright demon-1
strated more than average ability at
guard position.
Hazeltine, center, and Smith, for-1
ward, did the best work for the Zeta
Psi five. However, the team was out
of condition and did not perform as
well as it was capable of doing.
El Toro and Sigma Alpha Epsilon ]
won their games by forfeit. Several !
forfeits recently have caused the com-1
mittee on intramural athletics to send j
letters to the various organizations in I
order to find out which ones do not in- j
tend to enter teams. Forfeits are ex-!
ceedingly disliked by both players and
the athletic department, and it is plan
ned to cut down the number in the
present intramural leagues so that |
only active organizations will be j
formed in which members of all or-1
ganizations may play. This idea is j
similar to the old baseball "peanut" |
league.
Until the varsity and freshman i
squads are able to practice in the new j
pavilion, a definite schedule for the
rest of the quarter cannot be made |
out.
El Toro and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
played a practice game which was
won easily by the latter by 19 to 8.
The S. A. E. aggregation has one of >
the best teams in its league and will
no doubt make a strong bid for cham
pionship honors.
