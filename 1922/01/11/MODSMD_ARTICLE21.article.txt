# Distracting the Freshmen
## 
### 
If Stanford is to retain the men who will do the
most to heighten the prestige of this institution in the
scholastic and athletic worlds entering students must
not only he allowed, but must he urged to get into
their studies and into athletics or other worth-while
activities. Nothing else should interfere during the
first two quarters they are here.
Probably a thing that upsets the new student more
than anything else is fraternity rushing during the
first two weeks and the consequent wave of house
duties that follow. These duties are not confined to
fraternities, but the dormitories as well inflict cer
tain tasks on the freshman that distract him from
his studies and make it exceedingly difficult for him
to stay here.
A step has been taken by the newly formed Fra
ternity Council that will ultimately confine rushing
to the third quarter of the new student. Phone du
ties have been done away with in the dormitories by
the hiring of men to do the work. There still re
mains the decorating of dances, which can be over
come by a return to simplicity. Because it is possible
for organizations putting on dances to secure palms
and other potted trees from the University nursery,
and these, coupled with an ordinary system of light
ing, are all that are really necessary, relief looms in
that direction.
The fraternity problem still remains a large one, as
but three of the twenty-three Greek-letter societies
have agreed to do away with formal rushing and to
pledge at the end of the quarter. Ultimately the
other twenty will fall in line, and the goal, which is
pledging during the third quarter, will be attained.
When that goal is reached and these other distract
ing features of freshman life have been done awav
with, new students will have a chance to remain here
long enough to show their true mettle, and the bene
fits to them and to Stanford will be incalculable.
