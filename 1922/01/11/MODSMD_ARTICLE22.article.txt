# Honor in the Library
## 
### 
"A student has had five hours added to his grad
uation requirements for taking a hook from the
Library without signing for it." This is the text
of the latest decision by the Men's Council, and it
brings to light a different violation of the honor sys
tem.
According to the librarian, books have been taken
from the library indiscriminately during the past
quarter, but especially during the week preceding
final examinations. By taking a book from the Li
brary at any time, but particularly during that period
one student deprives many others of the use of that
text.
The penalty in this case is regarded as extremely
light and the reason advanced is that this is the first
instance of an infraction of this kind. It is only
a question of time until the Men's Council will refuse
to accept ignorance of the honor code as an excuse
and will begin making these penalties more severe.
It is difficult to understand how a student in the Uni
versity who is credited with having the ordinary con
ceptions of right and wrong and of the Golden Rule
ingrained in his mental makeup would take a book
that he knew he was not entitled to. Nevertheless,
these unauthorized borrowings occur regularly, and
often as many as forty books are missing from the
Library at one time.
The Men's Council has been lenient in a number
of cases because it believed that the particular of
fense had not been clearly defined as such in the
honor code. This attitude can be maintained indefi
nitely since 110 two cases will ever be exactly alike,
but it is certain that it will not be.
To define every offense that might be a direct in
fraction of the Honor System would be an impossi

bility, and moreover, it is entirely unnecessary. If
we bear in mind the ethical and moral principles
which govern man in his relation to modern civili
zation and establish the line which, if overstepped,
would volate these principles, we may be reasonably
sure that we are not violating the honor code.
