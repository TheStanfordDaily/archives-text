"Well, I dunno," said Hugo, the midnight moth, re
gistering his opinion a week late, "but if this Aurre—eh
—bless me —lives up to evpectations, his cold methods

The Demon Interviewer
So this was it! The place where he worked, thought,
came, and went! At last I was on the threshold of the
stronghold. Should I enter. Or shouldn't I? Ah, that
was the question. Or was it?

The pervading personality of the great man unstrung
me; I felt at loose ends. Pulling myself together, I
stepped forward... Then 1 stepped back... He was talk
ing; his redundant voice awoke the echoes. By this I
knew that he was asleep. .'I entered confidentially.
Hanging my hat, coat, and collar, on the floor I ap
proached his desk. What a desk! It was square, with
rounded corners, and had four limbs extending as far
as the floor. On top it was completely flat. How like
its owner! My glance fell on the floor.
* * #
Startled by the noise, he glanced up. I don't know
why he smiled.
* * *
"Have a seat," he murmured heartily... But I had one,
so I took a chair.
* # *
"Are you—" I began. Then something in my throat
caught. I choked.
* *
"No," he replied, "are you?"
* * *
And with this unequivocal thought, I vended my way
homeward through the magenta murk of evening, satis
fied that Eustace L. Fish was every inch or two a man.

In a stirring speech concocted last night before the
entire number present, X. Straw DeNary made the fol
lowing impassioned remarks:
* * *
"Now is the day and age when men and women want
first and foremost to have and to hold. As for me,
give liberty or give me death."
"My friends, it is up to us to keep the world safe for
democracy."
"The problem of the day is the question of the hour."
"What's the use, anyway, of passing on the fourth
down?"

It is with a feeling of deep and abysmal pride that
Cabbages presents to a waiting world the fully emanci
pated verse.. Attend!

"No corrections Made After Food Has Been Eaten" —
printed in bold red ink on the face of Leighton's Cafe
menu, Oakland. Very unaccommodating, to say the
i least. They probably figure it's useless to bother about
a dead man.

Speaking of newfangled medicine men and chiropo
