# LOCAL FIST ARTISTS SHOW PROMISE OF NIFTY MITT SHOWS
## 
### 
With the California tournament sched
uled for March 11, boxing has started
in earnest here. More tlian 150 pugilists
are working out daily under the direc
tion of Coach Harry Maloney, and pros
pects for a banner year in the roped
arena look to be very bright.
In the heavyweight class, Vern Ken
nedy is showing up well. There are but
few men in thi ~ class at present, how
ever, and there is a chance that new
material may develop. In the light
heavyweight class, Mark Evans, star of
last year's squad, is back and seems to
be going at top speed. Husky Was
sum, another veteran from last year, is
again seen wielding the mitts and is a
favorite for the. middle weight class.
Mike Hodges, Jimmie Ross, and Jack
Fishburn from a trio of lightweights
which is hard to beat. Hodges is going
in mid-season form.' Ross is another
veteran and is fully as dangerous with
bis mitts as he was last year when he
proved himself to be one of the best
on the coast in his class. Jack Fish
burn, with less experience than the
other two, is proving himself a danger
ous man and a contender for honors.
Shipp looks to be the class in the
feather weight division. He. is fast and
packs a mean punch in either mitt. But
few men have been able to stand up un
der his wicked right jabs, and he will
undoubtedly Kive a good account of him
self when the season starts.
Simons in the bantam weight and L.
Bell in the fly weight class are show
ing up best at present.
Mill Burkhard, Walter Bihls. and
Johnnie Lane, will fight it out in the
welter division. * Burkhard and Bihls
are veterans and both arc going in good j
style. Lane is new. but promises to give j
the best of them a tussle.
Bill Williams, '20, boxing manager, is j
considering several trips which will put I
Stanford pugilists on a plane with any j
other college boxers in the country. J.
I). (Don) Flint, former Stanford box
ing coach who is now in Honolulu, and i
lias been refereeing bouts there, is at-1
tempting to line up a trip for the Stan- !
ford pugilists which will take them to
Honolulu. March 25 has been set as
a tentative date for a tournament with
the Univer-ity of California, Southern
Branch. If this date is accepted, the |
squad will accompany the track team to,
Los Angeles, and a tournament with the
L. A. A. C. will probably be arranged.

favorite for the. middle weight class.
Mike Hodges, Jimmie Ross, and Jack
Fishburn from a trio of lightweights
which is hard to beat. Hodges is going
in mid-season form.' Ross is another
veteran and is fully as dangerous with
bis mitts as he was last year when he
proved himself to be one of the best
on the coast in his class. Jack Fish
burn, with less experience than the
other two, is proving himself a danger
ous man and a contender for honors.
Shipp looks to be the class in the
feather weight division. He. is fast and
packs a mean punch in either mitt. But
few men have been able to stand up un
der his wicked right jabs, and he will
undoubtedly Kive a good account of him
self when the season starts.
Simons in the bantam weight and L.
Bell in the fly weight class are show
ing up best at present.
Mill Burkhard, Walter Bihls. and
Johnnie Lane, will fight it out in the
welter division. * Burkhard and Bihls
are veterans and both arc going in good j
style. Lane is new. but promises to give j
the best of them a tussle.
Bill Williams, '20, boxing manager, is j
considering several trips which will put I
Stanford pugilists on a plane with any j
other college boxers in the country. J.
I). (Don) Flint, former Stanford box
ing coach who is now in Honolulu, and i
lias been refereeing bouts there, is at-1
tempting to line up a trip for the Stan- !
ford pugilists which will take them to
Honolulu. March 25 has been set as
a tentative date for a tournament with
the Univer-ity of California, Southern
Branch. If this date is accepted, the |
squad will accompany the track team to,
Los Angeles, and a tournament with the
L. A. A. C. will probably be arranged.
With the California tournament sched
uled for March 11, boxing has started
in earnest here. More tlian 150 pugilists
are working out daily under the direc
tion of Coach Harry Maloney, and pros
pects for a banner year in the roped
arena look to be very bright.
In the heavyweight class, Vern Ken
nedy is showing up well. There are but
few men in thi ~ class at present, how
ever, and there is a chance that new
material may develop. In the light
heavyweight class, Mark Evans, star of
last year's squad, is back and seems to
be going at top speed. Husky Was
sum, another veteran from last year, is
again seen wielding the mitts and is a
favorite for the. middle weight class.
