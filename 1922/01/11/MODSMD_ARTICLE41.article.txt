# UNIVERSITY GIVEN VALUABLE COPY OF THE DIVINE COMEDY
## 
### 
Stanford University has just received
las a gift of the Italians of the United
' State-, upon the initiative of Luigi Car-
I novale of Chicago, a magnificent color
reproduction of the original manuscript
of Dante's Divina Commedia.
This manuscript, known as the Co
i dice Trivulziano, was by
| Ser Francesca di Ser Xardo da Bar i
berino of Florence in 1337, sixteen years)
j after the death of Dante. There is not !
| a line of Dante's handwriting known to
|be in existence—not even his auto
graph. This beautiful illuminated maini
script is therefore the oldest in exist- j
ence. It is said to have been copied di- i
j rectly from the poet's own writing and
I hence must form the last court of appeal
for all later readers.
The reproduction brings out the tex
ture of the original parchment and col
ors of the ink and beautiful illuminations
| tions with startling realism. The vol-
I ume is bound in brown leather which is
hand-tooled and lettered in gold. Only
350 copies were struck off of which only j
i seventy will lie distributed in the United
i States. One of these has been presented j
Ito President Harding for the White]
i House Library of Congress. Most of
| the others, through the suggestion of
I Mr. Carnovale. have been given by the
j Italians of the United States to the lead- |
I ing American universities. The copy
j received by Stanford is valued at $S(X).
The volume was published by Ulrico
I loepli of Milan, under the supervision
j of the Dante Society of Italy in com
| memoration of the bOOtli anniversay of
the death of Dante. There is a pecu
liar appropriateness in Stanford's re
ceiviny one of these copies on account
of the recent publication of the Fnglish
metrical translation of the Divine Com
edy bv Dr. Melville Best Anderson of
j Stanford, who has devoted a quarter of
I a centurv to this work.
