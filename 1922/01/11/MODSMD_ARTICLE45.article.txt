# TENTATIVE SWIMMING SCHEDULE RELEASED
## 
### 
As a result of the faculty scholarship
axe and the loss of both George Drake
and Clarence Pinkston, prospects for
the varsity swimming team were given
a setback.
Pinkston won the world's champion
ship in fancy high diving at the Olympic
games and is considered one of the
greatest divers in history of aquatics.
George Drake was a member of the
water polo team and also swam the. 50
and 100-yard races on the varsity squad.
Harry Austin, a member of the relay
team, and also a participant in the 50-
yard event, did not return to college
this quarter, and his loss will also
weaken the team.
Coach Ernst Brandsten believes, how
ever, that lie has discovered a number
of new men at Stanford who. with the
veterans of last year and the members
of last year's freshmen team will de
velop a team that will rank with any
that has ever worn the Cardinal colors.
With the entrance of many former
nier high scjiool swimming Mars at the
beginning of this quarter, Stanford's
prospects are very bright for a fast
freshmen team. Don Young, a star
back-stroke swimmer, is the* only mem
ber of the freshmen that did not re
turn to college. There is a possibility
that he might return at the opening of
the spring quarter.
Lowell high school of San Francisco
contributes two new swimmers of known
ability to the freshmen squad : Kalm, a
breast-stroke swimmer, and Rosenbaum,
a plunger. Triest, formerly of Los An
geles high, will aid the 1925 team in
water polo and the breast-stroke events.
Bowers, a diver from San Diego, gives
promise to worry the opponents of the
freshmen team in his event.

Coach Ernst Brandsten believes, how
ever, that lie has discovered a number
of new men at Stanford who. with the
veterans of last year and the members
of last year's freshmen team will de
velop a team that will rank with any
that has ever worn the Cardinal colors.
With the entrance of many former
nier high scjiool swimming Mars at the
beginning of this quarter, Stanford's
prospects are very bright for a fast
freshmen team. Don Young, a star
back-stroke swimmer, is the* only mem
ber of the freshmen that did not re
turn to college. There is a possibility
that he might return at the opening of
the spring quarter.
Lowell high school of San Francisco
contributes two new swimmers of known
ability to the freshmen squad : Kalm, a
breast-stroke swimmer, and Rosenbaum,
a plunger. Triest, formerly of Los An
geles high, will aid the 1925 team in
water polo and the breast-stroke events.
Bowers, a diver from San Diego, gives
promise to worry the opponents of the
freshmen team in his event.
