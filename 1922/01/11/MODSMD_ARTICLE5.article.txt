# PROFESSOR J. B. SEARS RETURNS TO STANFORD
## 
### 
Professor J. B. Sears of the Educa-!
! tion department has just returned
! from Minneapolis, Minn., to resume
! his work at Stanford after an absence
jof a year and a half. Last year,
! which was his sabbatical leave, he
' spent at the University of Minnesota,
where he was professor of food ad
! ministration.
On September first, the State Legis
lature of Minnesota called Professor
I Sears to do some educational survey
work at the university. Although he
' had intended to return to Stanford to
i resume bis classes for the fall quar
ter, in view of the importance of this
| work, his leave of absence was re
i newed.
The committee wanted information
J regarding the university which could
be utilized as a basis for legislation
'in the future. As the survey was
I largely concerned with the financial
; conditions of the university, it was
j felt that the report which Professor
j Sears had prepared would prove of
unlimited value, furthering the inter
j ests of future educational efficiency.
