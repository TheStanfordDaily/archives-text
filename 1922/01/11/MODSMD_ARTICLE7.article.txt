# MISSION QUINTET TO BATTLE VARSITY IN SEASON'S OPENER
## Tonight Marks Passing of Encina Gym as Scene of Court Contests; Pavilion to be Ready by Saturday 
### 
Intercollegiate basketball, headliner on
the program of winter sports, makes its
entrance for 1922 tonight in the En
cina gymnasium.
Gene Van Gent's varsity live, appear
ing for tlie first time, will test its strength
with the rejuvenated quintet from the
University of Santa Clara.
Tonight's game marks the passing of
the Encina court as the scene of inter
collegiate basketball contests. On next
Saturday night its hard floor and in
adequate facilities for handling the large
crowds will give way to the spring floor
and comfortable, arrangements of the
new basketball pavilion.
Of the two teams that take tlie floor,
one will be comparatively inexperienced,
fairly light but fast â€”a combination that
is still in the experimental stage. That
will be the Stanford varsity.
Opposing them will be a live com

posed of three letter men and two mem
bers of the 1921 Livcrmore Cowboy live,
Vukota and McClinchey, a quintet with
a list of victories to its credit already.
Such is the aggregation from the. Mis
sion college.
When the two meet the result should
Jjc one of the hardest fought opening
games ever seen on the local courts.
Van Gent declined to make any an
nouncement as to the make-up of the
team that will wear the Cardinal colors
tonight. The quintet that will start the
contest will probably be Captain Davies.
McHose. forwards; Janssen. center;
Richmond and De Groot. guards.
If Davies takes up his work where
he left off last year, the Mission guards
will rind him a hard man to stop. The
Cardinal captain was responsible for 17
of Stanford's 25 points in the final and
deciding Stanford-California game last
year.
"Lefty" Rogers, forward on the 1921
team, will not start the game. Rogers
wrenched his knee in practice two nights
ago, and although the injury is not se
rious,- it will keep him from going at top
speed.
Two of the Stanford five, Janssen and
McHose, play their first varsity contest
tonight. Janssen fits in nicely at cen
ter, and will go a long distance toward
filling the vacancy left by "Swede"
Righter. McHose and Davies form a
pair of fast forwards, and in practice,
they work together well.
Dick Richmond, whose specialty is
bringing the spectators to their feet
with sensational long range -hots, is
back at his obi position of running
guard. De Groot, at standing guard,
played on the 1923 freshmen live, lie
will probably interchange with Janssen
during the game to allow the latter to j
recover his wind.
Van Gent drilled his men behind
closed doors yesterday afternoon, put- j
ting the first five through a stiff prac- J
tice. There was no workout tbi- aft
ernoon.
