# Wrestling Team To Tangle With Olympics on Feb. 15
## 
### 
Athletic Director Walter Powell has
arranged a match between the Stan
ford matmen and the Olympic Club
team, for February 15, at the Club
men's gymnasium.
Not much is known about the
strength of the Winged "O" team,
other than the fact that they have
several experienced nlen. It is believ
ed, however, by local wrestling fans,
that the affair will bo much more than
a set-up hefore the big bout with TT.C.
