——————————————————-» Our Motto: "We give all we can for what we net** —
#]T As people come to know us, they learn that this is a close
knit cooperative group of people intensely interested in in
terpreting the highest ideals of service.
OWe have fostered this spirit of servicb not only to our cus
tomers, but among ourselves. Promotion has come to those
who do their work so well that it lightens the work ot others.
Here we have no room for jealousies nor shirking.
f Every person in our organization is ambitious to win the
friendship and good will of every customer. That is why the
atmosphere here is so different from the usual. It is simply a
matter of higher standards.
