Ibis is the scene which will open the

j in the play.
I he buggy scene was not in the orig

j absolutely necessary to the plot and it
I was only recently that Coach Gordon
Davis decided to include il in the Stan
ford presentation. Undoubtedly, the in
terlude showing the return of the recal
citrant to her school, adds decidedly to
the effectiveness of the show. Every de
tail of the setting has been worked out
so that the audience will be given the
impression of a buggy driving straight
out towards the audience amid the down
pour, thunder, and lightning of a stormy
night in the woods.
