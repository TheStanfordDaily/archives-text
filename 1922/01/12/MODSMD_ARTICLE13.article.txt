# BABES OPEN COURT SEASON WITH WIN
## Defeat Palo Alto High Squad By Score of 42-13, in Game Featured by Ragged Play 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Stanford s freshman court team de i
fcated I lie Palo Alto High School live by i
a score of 42-13 at Eneina Gym last |
night.
The game, which was the first of the '
freshman schedule, was featured by |
great inaccuracy both in basket-shooting]
and in passing. Palo Alto was com- [
pletely outplayed : all four of their goals j
were made from long random shots from
the middle of the floor. They have a'
light team, that, against men of the j
same size, would ha\je been effective, but!
the weight and size of the Italics swept
them off their feet. After the first five [
minutes they devoted themselves to
breaking up plays and to long shots from
center court. The slippery condition of,
the floor also handicapped the high ;
school players, as they have been prac- i
ticing on an outdoor court.
It is too early in the season to expect \
teamwork or consistent playing 011 the
part of the freshmen. Except for rare
flashes, the entire game was every man
for himself, with a consequent confusion :
and many fouls.
Alexander and Hoffman started the
game at forward; Middleton started at
center. ancT Wisely and Houck held j
down the guard positions. At present
this combination appears to be able to
work together better than any other.
Alexander showed flashes of good play
ing. scoring three field goals in five j
minutes. He made a total of six goals, I
in the time be played. Hoffman scored -
four licld goals and made four out of]
nine tries at shooting fouls. Harry !
Shipke scored four field goals in the)
time that he played, but failed to show ,
as great ability in handling himself on ;
the flwor as Hoffman or Alexander.
Middleton scored three field goals, and ,
played a consistent game at center.
Scotield did most of the basket-shoot- j
ing for Palo Alto, completing three goals
and one foul shot.

great inaccuracy both in basket-shooting]
and in passing. Palo Alto was com- [
pletely outplayed : all four of their goals j
were made from long random shots from
the middle of the floor. They have a'
light team, that, against men of the j
same size, would ha\je been effective, but!
the weight and size of the Italics swept
them off their feet. After the first five [
minutes they devoted themselves to
breaking up plays and to long shots from
center court. The slippery condition of,
the floor also handicapped the high ;
school players, as they have been prac- i
ticing on an outdoor court.
It is too early in the season to expect \
teamwork or consistent playing 011 the
part of the freshmen. Except for rare
flashes, the entire game was every man
for himself, with a consequent confusion :
and many fouls.
Alexander and Hoffman started the
game at forward; Middleton started at
center. ancT Wisely and Houck held j
down the guard positions. At present
this combination appears to be able to
work together better than any other.
Alexander showed flashes of good play
ing. scoring three field goals in five j
minutes. He made a total of six goals, I
in the time be played. Hoffman scored -
four licld goals and made four out of]
nine tries at shooting fouls. Harry !
Shipke scored four field goals in the)
time that he played, but failed to show ,
as great ability in handling himself on ;
the flwor as Hoffman or Alexander.
Middleton scored three field goals, and ,
played a consistent game at center.
Scotield did most of the basket-shoot- j
ing for Palo Alto, completing three goals
and one foul shot.
