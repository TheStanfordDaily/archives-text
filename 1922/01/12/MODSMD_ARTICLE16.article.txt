# VARSITY QUINTET SHOWS TOP FORM WINS HARD GAME
## Basket by McHose in Final Three Minutes Wins Game For Cardinal Five; 23-22 
### G. H. Elmore, '23 
On a single point hinged the out
come of the Stanford-Santa Clara
; basketball game last night.
That one point rested on the Stan
j ford side of the score board, and the
'Cardinal varsity quintet, by a 23 to
22 score, sent home a team from the
j Mission college trailing a defeat for
| the fourth time in as many years.
Stanford led at half time, 15 to 11. *
About 1200 spectators, jammed into
the Encina gymnasium, saw a game as
full of excitement as a mid-season
s championship contest.
The first thrill came when Bob Jans
! sen, Cardinal certer, on the first jump
; off, tapped the ball to Davies, who
I took a step forward and tossed the
I ball through the basket from mid
court.

The Deciding Play

The spectators got their last thrill
three minutes before the final gun.
With the score tied at 20-20. Referee
Penaluna called a double roul. Va
kota, Santa Clara forward, converted
the point. Davies, almost exhausted
after three quarter's of hard playing,
walked coolly to the other end of the
court, and threw a clean basket, tying
the score again. A moment later Mc-
Hose put in the winning goal. That
ended the scoring, except for a foul
goal by Vakota.

Cardinal Team Is Surprise

There were two big surprises last
night. The first was the strength of
the Cardinal quintet. Regardless of
what has been said regarding lack of
material, Van Gent has put upon the
floor a five that will measure up to
the standards of Stanford teams of
recent years. The five-man defense,
with the short-passing game, effectu
ally stopped Santa Clara's attack, and
the Mission forwards were confined to
long-range shots.
The second surprise was DeGroot.
It was a forgone conclusion that
Richmond would make the spectators
cheer with his ability to throw goals
from the middle of the floor, and that
Davies, McHose, and Janssen would
play sensational basketball. But few
imagined that the big football player
would show up so well. He was prac
tically. impassable at the standing
guard position, and got the ball out
from under the Stanford basket in
good shape.
Van Gent crossed up the knowing
ones by starting Cleaveland at forward.
McHose went in near the end of the
