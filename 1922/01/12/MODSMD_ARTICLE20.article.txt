# The
						Coming of Warner
## 
### 
Glenn Warner is coming to Stanford to talk
over the possibility of his becoming coach here in
and to see what ought to be done during the
1 ( >22 and 1923 seasons if he is going to take charge.
The coming of Warner indicates that the Board
of Athletic Control, which shapes our athletic poli
cies,-is bent on securing the best possible coaching
for the team with the purpose of re-establishing a
Stanford system that will ensure our athletic success
in the future.
Warner is coming west upon the invitation of the
University. We will have a chance to meet the
man who is recognized as the foremost football
coach in the United States and will hear his views
011 the Stanford athletic situation. If we prove to
ourselves that Warner can give us the coaching
we desire and can re-establish a Stanford system,
and if he is willing to come to Stanford, an agree
ment will doubtless be reached that will do a great
deal toward the promotion of successful athletics
here.
