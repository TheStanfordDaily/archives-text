# A
						"House-warming" Party
## 
### 
Every student in Stanford University has had a
part in the Imilding of the new basketball pavilion,
and everyone will be welcomed at the "house-warm
ing" party which is being sponsored by the Board
of Athletic Control tomorrow night.
The construction of the pavilion was made possible
through a tax, self-imposed by the students of the
University, and the voluntary donation of sums of
money from their annual budgets by President Wil
bur and Comptroller Roth. It is, therefore, a local
enterprise, and every member of the student body
should feel that lie is part owner in the building
and be on hand for its dedication.
The idea has grown that the dedication party ar
ranged by the Board of Athletic Control was in
tended primarily to attract those who dance. A
large proportion of people get the greatest enjoy
ment out of dancing, so most of the evening will be
devoted to that, but entertainment will be provided
for those who do not care to stay through the whole
evening. To many it will be the first opportunity to
inspect the new building.
There are several features that should attract the
curious. It is the largest building that is devoted
primarily to basketball in this section of the country
an'd possibly in the United States. Special construc
tion arrangements were made to aid the players of
the court game.
The largest feature is that it marks the consum
mation of another project that was fostered and sup
ported by the students and officials of Stanford
University.
The Board of Athletic Control says that the latch
string is out for every member of the student body
and the faculty.
