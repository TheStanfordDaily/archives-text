# The
						Basketball Team

### 
Another intercollegiate athletic season has been in
augurated successfully. Last night the Stanford
basketball quintet, with but two veteran players in
the line-up, won the opening game from a team that
has already completed a fair-sized schedule and is in
mid-season form.
Even the most hopeful of Stanford supporters re
fused to hope for a victory for the Cardinal cage
team under the conditions governing the game last
night. Yet an untried Stanford team earned a well
timed victory over an experienced and well-balanced
opponent.
The victory indicates several things. Stanford has
the material for another well-balanced court team.
Stanford has a well-coached basket fall live. Stan
ford's team will be a strong contender for chain

1 pionsip honors in the Pacific Coast .Conference.
One game does not make a season any more than
one student makes a university, but the results of
that contest last night certainly knocked the notion
that Stanford will he a weak sister in basketball
circles this season, and served to awaken the stu
dent body to a realization of the possibilities in the
| team.
