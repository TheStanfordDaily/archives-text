Dear Head of Cabbages:—The following item from
the San Jose Mercury-Herald of December 17th, isn't
of any use to me so I send it to you in hopes my col
leagues can get some good from it:

CABBAGE GROWERS
FIGHTING PESTS
Agriculturists Have Succeeded
In Raising Variety That
Is Immune to Disease
Racine, Wis., Dec. IS. —Dr. L
It. Jones, University of Wis
consin, after a ten-year fight
has eliminated Yellows in cab
bages. Cabbage grows almost
everywhere in the U.S. but has
been an unsatisfactory crop be
cause after a few years of pro
ductions it would invariably be
come infected with Yellows and
henceforth for all time would
refuse to grow. Seed will be
shipped to other colleges to be
used by them in overcoming
their Yellow-infected cabbages.
* * #
Thursday intends publishing something each week
under the heading, "Humor for Highbrows" but for
this week the above should be more than sufficient.
* * *
To localize J. Sticky Wilson's remarks: "What shall
it profit a man if he has all the back-push of Stanford
behind him, and adds nothing to it."
* # *
Can't pick up a paper nowadays without reading how
1 Baggy of the Sun Dodgers has gathered unto himself
a couple dozen more young men "eligible for the var
sity next fall." Bagshaw says he's going to beat A.
Smith & Co. (not Ltd.) at its own game hereafter and
so if the Bruin Gold Varsity consists of three teams
his will have four.
# * *
Why stop at four, Baggy? Cal won't. President Wil
bur told the U. C. students at an assembly of theirs
over a year ago that Stanford was once frightened for a
while at the swift growth of California but soon realized
there was nothing to worry about —that the football
team was still the same size. Baggy and Andy have
come to believe, however, that the size of a football
team should keep pace with that of the institution it
represents. What does the future hold?
«• W * »
Meanwhile, the change proposed from Sun Dodgers to
Vikings seems appropriate, for with the Everett Hi team
plus the return of Peter Grimm and the fetching of
various eligibles U. of W. is determined to have "a place
in the sun."
*♦ * .
Now for the future. Letter from U. C. student to
parents, November 15, 1927: "Well, folks, I've made
| the eighteenth team and that means I'm pretty sure of
my big 'C'. Andy Smith Is going to use a whole new
team every five minutes and that means that all the
first-string men will get into the battle. Teams 13 to
24 are known as the second-string, from which Andy
will pick his substitutes as first-string men get tired.
In case of many injuries, cousin Charlie on String 3,
j team 25. will stand a good chance of breaking in."
w * »
Newspaper account of U.C.—U.W. 1923 game:
"Baggy" put over a clever one on the Bruins in their
.big battle yesterday. He threw in a whole new team
for every single play. The mastodonic Viking squad
was carefully rehearsed for months as to the part each
eleven was to play in the drama. Each team went thru
its act with that machine-like precision enemy Smith
has always depended on for success. Movie royalties
will be high because of the immense size of the cast,
outdoing any Italian film.
* * *
j Newspaper clipping, 1942:
Coach Smith of California wantS a new rule, per
i mitting a fresh team to take the field before the eleven
then out on the gridiron has completed its play. His
argument, which is deserving of the most careful con
j sideration, is that his end, Muller 11, throws such long
passes that by the time they are caught the public gets
tired of seeing the same team. Smith's scheme would
I speed up games, a matter highly desirable.

Newspaper item, 1952:
Little Stanford has only 4000 men but members of its
■ varsity gave an exhibition of foolhardy pluck in yes
terday's Big Game, unheard of since the messenger on
foot beat the 'bus line running from Marathon to the
city. Knowing how few good men were available, sever
al plays stayed in the game for almost an entire quar
ter, and one of them for 23 minutes. Officials and coach
! es deny guilt of barbaric brutality, but condemnation
! of such magnificently foolish stamina is widespread,
i '1 he Grand Jury will meet tonight to consider means
i of action. It is rumored that the Federal Government
may step in in case local authorities are not drastic
* * *
That game last night was Nip and Tuck until "Nip"
tucked it away with that last shot.

No, ladies, the fact that Thursday has not mentioned
i the co-eds yet this year is not a New Year's Resolution.
Next week ho will consider them when he goes crystal
gazing again and delineates the future in the colyura.

CABBAGE GROWERS
FIGHTING PESTS
Agriculturists Have Succeeded
In Raising Variety That
Is Immune to Disease
Racine, Wis., Dec. IS. —Dr. L
It. Jones, University of Wis
consin, after a ten-year fight
has eliminated Yellows in cab
bages. Cabbage grows almost
everywhere in the U.S. but has
been an unsatisfactory crop be
cause after a few years of pro
ductions it would invariably be
come infected with Yellows and
henceforth for all time would
refuse to grow. Seed will be
shipped to other colleges to be
used by them in overcoming
their Yellow-infected cabbages.
* * #
Thursday intends publishing something each week
under the heading, "Humor for Highbrows" but for
this week the above should be more than sufficient.
* * *
To localize J. Sticky Wilson's remarks: "What shall
it profit a man if he has all the back-push of Stanford
behind him, and adds nothing to it."
* # *
Can't pick up a paper nowadays without reading how
1 Baggy of the Sun Dodgers has gathered unto himself
a couple dozen more young men "eligible for the var
sity next fall." Bagshaw says he's going to beat A.
Smith & Co. (not Ltd.) at its own game hereafter and
so if the Bruin Gold Varsity consists of three teams
his will have four.
# * *
Why stop at four, Baggy? Cal won't. President Wil
bur told the U. C. students at an assembly of theirs
over a year ago that Stanford was once frightened for a
while at the swift growth of California but soon realized
there was nothing to worry about —that the football
team was still the same size. Baggy and Andy have
come to believe, however, that the size of a football
team should keep pace with that of the institution it
represents. What does the future hold?
«• W * »
Meanwhile, the change proposed from Sun Dodgers to
Vikings seems appropriate, for with the Everett Hi team
plus the return of Peter Grimm and the fetching of
various eligibles U. of W. is determined to have "a place
in the sun."
*♦ * .
Now for the future. Letter from U. C. student to
parents, November 15, 1927: "Well, folks, I've made
| the eighteenth team and that means I'm pretty sure of
my big 'C'. Andy Smith Is going to use a whole new
team every five minutes and that means that all the
first-string men will get into the battle. Teams 13 to
24 are known as the second-string, from which Andy
will pick his substitutes as first-string men get tired.
In case of many injuries, cousin Charlie on String 3,
j team 25. will stand a good chance of breaking in."
w * »
Newspaper account of U.C.—U.W. 1923 game:
"Baggy" put over a clever one on the Bruins in their
.big battle yesterday. He threw in a whole new team
for every single play. The mastodonic Viking squad
was carefully rehearsed for months as to the part each
eleven was to play in the drama. Each team went thru
its act with that machine-like precision enemy Smith
has always depended on for success. Movie royalties
will be high because of the immense size of the cast,
outdoing any Italian film.

Newspaper account of U.C.—U.W. 1923 game:
"Baggy" put over a clever one on the Bruins in their
.big battle yesterday. He threw in a whole new team
for every single play. The mastodonic Viking squad
was carefully rehearsed for months as to the part each
eleven was to play in the drama. Each team went thru
its act with that machine-like precision enemy Smith
has always depended on for success. Movie royalties
will be high because of the immense size of the cast,
outdoing any Italian film.

Dear Head of Cabbages:—The following item from
the San Jose Mercury-Herald of December 17th, isn't
of any use to me so I send it to you in hopes my col
leagues can get some good from it:

CABBAGE GROWERS
FIGHTING PESTS
Agriculturists Have Succeeded
In Raising Variety That
Is Immune to Disease
Racine, Wis., Dec. IS. —Dr. L
It. Jones, University of Wis
consin, after a ten-year fight
has eliminated Yellows in cab
bages. Cabbage grows almost
everywhere in the U.S. but has
been an unsatisfactory crop be
cause after a few years of pro
ductions it would invariably be
come infected with Yellows and
henceforth for all time would
refuse to grow. Seed will be
shipped to other colleges to be
used by them in overcoming
their Yellow-infected cabbages.

Thursday intends publishing something each week
under the heading, "Humor for Highbrows" but for
this week the above should be more than sufficient.
* * *
To localize J. Sticky Wilson's remarks: "What shall
it profit a man if he has all the back-push of Stanford
behind him, and adds nothing to it."
* # *
Can't pick up a paper nowadays without reading how
1 Baggy of the Sun Dodgers has gathered unto himself
a couple dozen more young men "eligible for the var
sity next fall." Bagshaw says he's going to beat A.
Smith & Co. (not Ltd.) at its own game hereafter and
so if the Bruin Gold Varsity consists of three teams
his will have four.
# * *
Why stop at four, Baggy? Cal won't. President Wil
bur told the U. C. students at an assembly of theirs
over a year ago that Stanford was once frightened for a
while at the swift growth of California but soon realized
there was nothing to worry about —that the football
team was still the same size. Baggy and Andy have
come to believe, however, that the size of a football
team should keep pace with that of the institution it
represents. What does the future hold?
«• W * »
Meanwhile, the change proposed from Sun Dodgers to
Vikings seems appropriate, for with the Everett Hi team
plus the return of Peter Grimm and the fetching of
various eligibles U. of W. is determined to have "a place
in the sun."

Now for the future. Letter from U. C. student to
parents, November 15, 1927: "Well, folks, I've made
