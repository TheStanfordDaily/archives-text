## 
### 
m
Small ornamental tiles are being fitted
on the two domes of the new Union.
The tiles are red, with a border of
jade. One dome is already completed,
and the other will be finished within a
few days.
Plastering of the remainder of the ar-
I cades is all that is left of the tinting
I on the outside of the building, while all
j that remains inside is the work on the
kitchen. As soon as this is coated, the
cooking equipment will be set in place
A tank for holding the oil for the stoves
is at present awaiting installation.
The third floor is now complete, with
all woodwork stained, the shower rooms
completed, and a telephone call system
