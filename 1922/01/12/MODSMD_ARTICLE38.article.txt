i BRIANO TO ASK FOR VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE.
The vote of today in the French
Parliament will decide whether Pre*
mier Briand will remain in power or
whether he will be forced to resign to
be succeeded by those who oppose liis
concessions at Cannes. M. Briand re
ceived a telegram from the Senate
Foreign Affairs Committee with the
signature of former president Poin
care, warning him that the proposed
treaty with Great Britain could not
become effective without the consent
of the French Parliament. His five
delegations were:
First —That the reconstruction of
France is essential to the reconstruc-
I tion of Europe.
Second —That the reparations award
ed France must remain unchanged
I without affecting the arrangement of
I May 5, 1921, and without disturbing
the priority of Belgium.
Third—That France can not accept
the invitation to attend the conference
at Genoa unless she has been given
previous assurance that her rights will
be respected.
Fourth —That the Franco-British al
liance must begin by confirming all
guarantees means of execution and
rights to inflict penalties on Germany
which France holds under the Versa
illes Treaty, and subsequent agree
j ments.
Fifth —That nothing concluded at
Cannes shall become effective without
| the collaboration of the French Parlia
ment.
It is reported that Briand faces in
terpellations from his own faction,
j the "Entente Republicaine Democra
i tique," as well as those of the Cle
! menceau Party and his position is con
sidered dubious. He may refuse to
answer interpellations because of lack
of time.
