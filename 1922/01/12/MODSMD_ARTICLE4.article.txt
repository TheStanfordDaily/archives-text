# EDUCATION BOARD'S OFFER FINAL PROOF OF ENDOWMENT NEED
## Lyman Pierce Tells of Steps in Securing $300,000 For Salaries From Foundation 
### 
"The $300,000 offer of the General Ed- I
ucation Hoard of the Rockefeller Foun
dation is final proof of Stanford's need
for an increased endowment," said Ly
man L. Pierce, director of "The First
Million for Stanford" campaign, in an
interview today. "Soon after the appeal
for help was made, the books and all
operations of the University were
thrown open to a corps of experts sent
out by the Board, which is recognized j
as the most exacting foundation in the
country, The offer was therefore the |
result of investigation by an entirely
disinterested group better equipped than j
anyone else to obtain the facts. This
process put to an acid test the Univer- !
sitv's right to ask for additional funds." !
The General Education Board is thej
branch of the Rockefeller Foundation
devoted to promotion of higher educa-1
tion. During the past four years, when j
every college in the country went I
through a period of great stress due to j
j advancing prices, practically all colleges 1
I appealed to this board for help. In de- ,
| ciding on the worth of each request, al
j though many were rejected in the i
j board's offices, representatives were al ,
| ways sent to make ;i searching analysis of j
the colleges whose appeals were thought j
|to have any worth. The board's experts'
came to Stanford to determine, not so!
| much if the University ,was worthy of!
I help, but if it really needed any.
Shortly afterward. President Wilbur i
was informed that the General Educa
tion Board found that Stanford's great |
est immediate need was for additions |
and readjustments in the salaries of pro- !
' fessors in the College of Arts and I
| Sciences, which includes all branches ex
cept the professional schools.
They therefore made an offer of 1
$300,000 toward a million-dollar increase
in endowment funds, the income from)
this Tnoney to be applied to faculty!
salaries.
The other two millions to be raised
will be devoted to building upkeep and
expansion to research work, as well a> j
aiding the Medical College in San Fran
cisco.
