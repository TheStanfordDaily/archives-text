# GLENN WARNER TO COME WEST NEXT WEEK; WILL LOOK OVER STANFORD ATHLETIC SITUATION
## Pittsburg Mentor May Arrange to Put Lieutenant on Job Until Opening of 1924 Season 
### 
Dr. T. M. Williams' announcement that Glenn Warner of Pittsburgh is
coming to California next week, strengthens the possibility of the eastern
I mentor's acceptance of a Stanford offer of the position of head coach, be
ginning with the 1924 season. It is known that Warner wants to come
west. His trip across the country to look over the Stanford athletic situa- '
tion points toward his probable acceptance of the job of making the Cardinals '
a winning combination.
The language of the issued statement does not say that Warner is seri
ously to be counted on as a prospect for the job as football mentor of the
University, but as he has been dickering with the Board for several weeks
and has at last decided to make the trip west, everything seems to point to
the fact that he is really counting upon making the change to Stanford if
his terms are acceptable to the Uni-1 tlie present time, install one of his

! versity. The fact tliat the University
j has invited him to make the trip west
j in itself makes it more than a mere
I conjecture that he is being consider-
I ed as a more or less sure thing for
the job.
What the system will be in regard
to the building up of the Warner j
method of football at Stanford, should '
"Pop" come to the farm, .remains in :
rloubt. The solution might lie reached
in several ways. He could, after look
ing over the situation as it exists at j

lieutenants on the job, and by bis
control, institute the Warner system
| for the next two intervening seasons
! with (he idea of getting it fairly un
! der way before he is able to take per
sonal charge of the work. A second
method would be to have the present
j mentor remain in charge under the
general instruction of Warner from
his eastern post.
In the latter case it will very likely 1
be the attempt of the Board of Ath-j
letic Control to have Warner here for ;
| the Spring practice in order that he j
may put his personality into the pre
liminary work of the eleven and ac-1
quaint the men with the Warner style
of play. In this case men would have ;
to be obtained who are versed in the j
Warner system to coach the freshman
team, because with the installation
of Warner it would be the aim of the |
Board to put in a complete system of
: instruction for the man entering col
lege so that he would learn but one
style of football, and that would be
the kind that he would play under the
famous mentor. This system of one
stylo of play from the first entrance
jas a freshman is' the kind that has
turned out winning teams for univer
sities that use it and will undobtedly
be followed if plans regarding Warner
mature here.

lege so that he would learn but one
style of football, and that would be
the kind that he would play under the
famous mentor. This system of one
stylo of play from the first entrance

Dr. T. M. Williams' announcement that Glenn Warner of Pittsburgh is
coming to California next week, strengthens the possibility of the eastern
I mentor's acceptance of a Stanford offer of the position of head coach, be
ginning with the 1924 season. It is known that Warner wants to come
west. His trip across the country to look over the Stanford athletic situa- '
tion points toward his probable acceptance of the job of making the Cardinals '
a winning combination.
The language of the issued statement does not say that Warner is seri
ously to be counted on as a prospect for the job as football mentor of the
University, but as he has been dickering with the Board for several weeks
and has at last decided to make the trip west, everything seems to point to
the fact that he is really counting upon making the change to Stanford if
his terms are acceptable to the Uni-1 tlie present time, install one of his

! versity. The fact tliat the University
j has invited him to make the trip west
j in itself makes it more than a mere
I conjecture that he is being consider-
I ed as a more or less sure thing for
the job.
What the system will be in regard
to the building up of the Warner j
method of football at Stanford, should '
"Pop" come to the farm, .remains in :
rloubt. The solution might lie reached
in several ways. He could, after look
ing over the situation as it exists at j

lieutenants on the job, and by bis
control, institute the Warner system
| for the next two intervening seasons
! with (he idea of getting it fairly un
! der way before he is able to take per
sonal charge of the work. A second
method would be to have the present
j mentor remain in charge under the
general instruction of Warner from
his eastern post.
In the latter case it will very likely 1
be the attempt of the Board of Ath-j
letic Control to have Warner here for ;
| the Spring practice in order that he j
may put his personality into the pre
liminary work of the eleven and ac-1
quaint the men with the Warner style
of play. In this case men would have ;
to be obtained who are versed in the j
Warner system to coach the freshman
team, because with the installation
of Warner it would be the aim of the |
