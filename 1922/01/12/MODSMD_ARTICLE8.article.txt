# STITT WILSON CALLS FOR ACTION IN TALK
## 
### 
" There are three things which are I
fundamental to the human race. No man ;
can get away from eating, sex, and the !
problem of how to make a just living,"!
J. Stitt Wilson told the assembly last
night. " I here are no three things of
which the human race is so ignorant to- i
day. Ihe world today needs determined j
and courageous men who will give their
lives to enlightening mankind on these
three great problems."
The speech last night was the last of
a series of live. It was the plea for
action. Ihe crowd was fairly large,
considering the fact that the lirst basket
ball game of the season was being plavcd
at the gymnasium.
"We must feel or care about the eco
nomic and spiritual conditions of the!
world today. The god of success has I
blinded our eyes! We must think about
these conditions in the light of all the
knowledge which we can gain from the
great cultures o) the world—science,
history, philosophy, art. and revelation,"
Wilson went on to say. "Then, if we j
are to carry out this process'to its logi
cal conclusion, we must act in such a
way that our lives will be definitely tied j
up in the task of serving humanity.
"One of the greatest tragedies of life |
is an educated man without a great, Cen- j
tral, moving moral purpose. Let every j
student here tonight resolve for him i
self, 'I am going to seek for and be i
loyal to the truth, both about the depth j
ot. my own being and in my relations to j
others.'
"Keep the springs of human kindness j
flowing in your life. Don't dam them -
up!"
Mr. Wilson closed his talk with a
strong appeal to students to take a deli ;
nite, decisive stand for human values,
as opposed to sellis* mid privileged in J
t crests.
A complete syllabus of J. Stitt Wil j
son's series of ten lectures, live of which
lie delivered at Stanford, is being pre
pared. This will be ready for distribu
tion soon and will be mailed for 10 cents
to those who want it.
