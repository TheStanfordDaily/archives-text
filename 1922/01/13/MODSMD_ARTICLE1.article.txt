# PLANS PREPARED FOR ENDOWMENT AID BY CAMPUS
## Canvasser Will Be Assigned to Each Ten Students; Force of Local Example is Cited 
### 
Complete organization of the en
dowment program on the campus,
which will lead off in "The First Mil
lion For Stanford" campaign, was af
fected last night in the Little Theatre,
at a meeting of all student body en
dowment committees- Representatives
of every living group on the campus
were present.
The plan adopted provides for a
campaign worker for every ten stu
dents, with a chairman in charge of
activities in each residence unit. The
group chairmen will be responsible to
the following general organization
heads: Encina, C. J. Tauzer; Sequoia,
A. R. Tyler; Roble, Kathryn Donald;
fraternities, Stoddard Atwood; sorori
ties, Dorothy Hare; men commuters,
T. M. Kleckner; women commuters,
Dorothy Cramer.
The Executive Committee of the
A. S. S. U. will direct the program
as a whole. The canvassers, to be ap
pointed at once by living-group chair
men, are to gather for instructions at
the next meeting of the working com
mittees, to be next Thursday, in the
Little Theatre.
Every student in the University is
to be seen personally, under the sys
tem outlined, so that some preliminary
idea of what each one is able to con
tribute may be found out. It was
especially emphasized that nobody was
to be forced to give. Presentation of
the appeal as a necessity which must
be met, with each student making only
what sacrifices for his University he
can reasonably afford, was urged.
Lyman L. Pierce, director of the
"First Million" campaign, said in ex
plaining the campus' place in the
movement: "Nothing will mean more
to the success of the enterprise than
the knowledge of what part the stu
dents have played in it —they are call
ed upon to set the standard. The first
question I have been asked by alumni
everywhere is, 'what is the attitude on
the campus?' There will be nothing
that Avill so completely commit them
to the cause as the news that the stu
dent body has taken on part of the
• burden, is also making sacrifices for
Stanford.
"This movement is the beginning of
a new policy for Stanford. Never be
fore the past year, In which the stadi
um appeal was confined to the athletic
end; this is the first opportunity given
for a real expression of loyalty
to the University. It was the start
made by the studonts which gave the
: tadium campaign its big impetus; the
same is true of the endowment, and
this campaign is fifteen times bigger.
"This necessity did not come about
by chance," he continued, in outlin
ing the background of the movement,
"it was forced oil University authori
ties as the only way out of financial
stress. As early as 1915 the presi
dent's report indicated that the then
great resources of Stanford would not
be adequate for future development.
Stanford has been planned with a view
1 o continual expansion, a plan which
wili eventually make it one of the
rrreatest universities in the country.
It was seen at that time that Stanford
was barely holding its own. When
the war came along, with its deprecia
tion of the dollar, Stanford, like every
other college in the country, had to
struggle under tremendous financial
difficulties.
"In 1919 President Wilbur's report
outlined the plan which the Trustees
had decided was necessary to relieve
the burden. This plan called for more
buildings, and for a readjustment in
faculty salaries. The next Step was
the call to the alumni organizations
throughout the country. Representa
tives sent from all over the country
met, and after looking over the situa
tion thoroughly, unanimously endorsed
the increase.
"Finally came the spontaneous offer
of the student body to take the lead
in the movement." Pierce concluded,
"In all university endowment activi
ties the student bodies have co-operat
ed to a great extent; but never in my
experience have the students actually
determined to take the lead "

were present.
The plan adopted provides for a
campaign worker for every ten stu
dents, with a chairman in charge of
activities in each residence unit. The
group chairmen will be responsible to
the following general organization
heads: Encina, C. J. Tauzer; Sequoia,
A. R. Tyler; Roble, Kathryn Donald;
fraternities, Stoddard Atwood; sorori
ties, Dorothy Hare; men commuters,
T. M. Kleckner; women commuters,
Dorothy Cramer.
The Executive Committee of the
A. S. S. U. will direct the program
as a whole. The canvassers, to be ap
pointed at once by living-group chair
men, are to gather for instructions at
the next meeting of the working com
mittees, to be next Thursday, in the
Little Theatre.
Every student in the University is
to be seen personally, under the sys
tem outlined, so that some preliminary
idea of what each one is able to con
tribute may be found out. It was
especially emphasized that nobody was
to be forced to give. Presentation of
the appeal as a necessity which must
be met, with each student making only
what sacrifices for his University he
can reasonably afford, was urged.
Lyman L. Pierce, director of the
"First Million" campaign, said in ex
plaining the campus' place in the
movement: "Nothing will mean more
to the success of the enterprise than
the knowledge of what part the stu
dents have played in it —they are call
ed upon to set the standard. The first
question I have been asked by alumni
everywhere is, 'what is the attitude on
the campus?' There will be nothing
that Avill so completely commit them
to the cause as the news that the stu
dent body has taken on part of the
• burden, is also making sacrifices for
Stanford.
"This movement is the beginning of
a new policy for Stanford. Never be
fore the past year, In which the stadi
um appeal was confined to the athletic
end; this is the first opportunity given
for a real expression of loyalty
to the University. It was the start
made by the studonts which gave the
: tadium campaign its big impetus; the
same is true of the endowment, and
this campaign is fifteen times bigger.
"This necessity did not come about
by chance," he continued, in outlin
ing the background of the movement,
"it was forced oil University authori
ties as the only way out of financial
stress. As early as 1915 the presi
dent's report indicated that the then
great resources of Stanford would not
be adequate for future development.
Stanford has been planned with a view
1 o continual expansion, a plan which
wili eventually make it one of the
rrreatest universities in the country.
It was seen at that time that Stanford
was barely holding its own. When
the war came along, with its deprecia
tion of the dollar, Stanford, like every
other college in the country, had to
struggle under tremendous financial
difficulties.
"In 1919 President Wilbur's report
outlined the plan which the Trustees
had decided was necessary to relieve
the burden. This plan called for more
buildings, and for a readjustment in
faculty salaries. The next Step was
the call to the alumni organizations
throughout the country. Representa
tives sent from all over the country
met, and after looking over the situa
tion thoroughly, unanimously endorsed
the increase.
"Finally came the spontaneous offer
of the student body to take the lead
in the movement." Pierce concluded,
"In all university endowment activi
ties the student bodies have co-operat
ed to a great extent; but never in my
experience have the students actually
determined to take the lead "
Complete organization of the en
