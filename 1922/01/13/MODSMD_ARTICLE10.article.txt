# ZOOLOGISTS HEAR DR. GRINNELL TELL OF BIRDS' HABITS
## 
### 
Dr. J. G. Grinnell of the University! l
of California spoke to the Zoology Club!
last night at the home of Professor and !
Mrs. Edwin C. Stacks in Palo Alto, j
Dr. Grinnell is acknowledged as an au
thority on vertebrate zoology. He spoke!
on the correlation of habits and feed- j
ing of various birds.
"The hermit thrush," said Dr. Grin-j
ne.ll, "assumes a statuesque position i
when it is about to feed. It stands per
! fectly still and, watching closely, seizes
j upon those living insects which it sees j
'moving about. On the other hand birds 1
like the wren are always active. They
hop about and feed largely upon still
! things."
Dr. Grintiell mentioned a very inter jesting
-esting fact about bird calls and sing
ling. "Birds do not sing for tlie pleas-j
tire of singing," he affirmed. "Each bird i
covers a certain amount of territory and j
its singing, and especially its calls, in- !
form the other birds of its whereabout*. j
| Dr. Grinnell lias studied bird habits very j
I closely and he said that in migrating. I
the male bird always goes ahead and se- ,
i lects the tree which will he his habitation j
| later.
It was announced that at the next j
| meeting Joseph Sleviu of the California i
i Academy of Sciences would speak on j
"The Earlier Work Done By the C ali-
I fornia Expedition to Galapagos Islands, j
| Mr. Slevin went on this expedition him-j
(self and is well able to talk on this sub-I
! ject.
This week-end the Zoology Club plans |
I a hike to Great Basin.
