# FORMAL RUSHING OF MEN TO TERMINATE NEXT MONDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Formal rushing of freshmen by Greek
letter fraternities will end midnight
Monday, January 16. Fraternity bids
must be turned in to Heaton Wrenn, '21,
president of the lnterfraternity Confer
ence, at the Phi Delta Theta House he
fore 12 o'clock Monday evening. Official
bidding cards will be distributed.
Under the new interfraternity consti
tution, the time, between the termina
tion of formal rushing and the day when
the freshmen go to the lawyer has been
shortened from three days to one day.
"From 12 o'clock midnight of the thir
teenth day until after the freshman con
sults with the interfraternity lawyer on
the fifteenth day there shall be a closed
period during which no fraternity shall
have any communication whatsoever
with a freshman."
The constitution of last year required
a second formal rushing period, imme
diately following the first pledging day,
at the end of which there was second
opportunity for houses to bid men
through the lawyer. There will be no
such period this quarter. The Inter
fraternity Conference constitution pro
vides that "after the consultation of
freshmen with the. Interfraternity Con
ference lawyer on the fifteenth day, there
will be informal rushing and bidding."
The five fraternities which have not
signed the conference constitution, Beta
Theta Pi, Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, and Phi Kappa
Psi, will be bound by the minimum re
quirements of the constitution. How
ever. according to the constitution re
cently formed by the first three houses,
these fraternities will not bid freshmen
until the end of the quarter.
