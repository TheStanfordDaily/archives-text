# CARDINAL COURT FIVE TO MEET COLLEGE OF PACIFIC IN PAVILION
## 
### 
Van Gent's varsity basketball team, with a two-day rest after the contest,
with Santa Clara, will face the College of Pacittc Tigers tomorrow night, in
Stanford's new $100,0(H) basketball pavilion.
It will be more than just an ordinary basketball game. The Cardinal
quintet will enter the fray determined to inaugurate the new building with a
clean-cut victory. The Methodists are invading the campus with the idea
of breaking up the program.
About a year ago "Swede" Righter, Cardinal basketball and gridiron star,
played forward on a surprised Stanford quintet that found itself outplayed by

the hitherto unheard of team from the
College of the Pacific. Righter and
his mates came back strong in the
last half, however, and beat the visit
ors.
Tomorrow night Righter will walk
on the basketball court, not as the
mainstay of the Stanford five, but as
the coach of the College of Pacific
Tigers. The Tiger five is the product
of Righter's first season as a basket
ball coach, and he has overlooked
nothing to turn out a strong team.
All of the Stanford basket shooters
came through Wednesday's contest un
scathed. Van Gent resumed his in
tensive drilling last night, running the
squad through plays and starting a
short practice game. There was a
light work-out today to put the men
on edge.
Just who will start against the Meth
odists is not yet determined. In all
probability the Davies-McHose com
bination at the forward positions
which worked well in the Mission
game will be used. Bob Janssen seems
to be the only one in the running at
center and the former freshman cap
tain is sure to play most of the game.
Richmond at running guard has started
off in mid-season form, and his shots
from the center of the court are find
ing the basket with regularity. De-
Groot, on account of his showing
against Santa Clara, has the call on
the standing guard position.
There are several promising players
who did not get a chance to play in
the opening fray, and if Stanford has
a comfortable lead. Van Gent will
probably send some of them in. Fred
Anderson who is making a great bid
for running guard is ready to go in
if anything should happen to Rich
mond. Van Gent has Smith, Pollard,
and Faville on reserve for standing
guard.
Cleaveland will probably relieve one
of the forwards for a time, and Howell
may be sent in for Janssen. "Lefty"
Rogers' knee will not. be in shape for
about a week. Van Gent said yester
day.
Little is known of the College of
Pacific team, save that two veterans,
Spoon and Captain Wagner, are back.

Pacific team, save that two veterans,
Spoon and Captain Wagner, are back.
Van Gent's varsity basketball team, with a two-day rest after the contest,
with Santa Clara, will face the College of Pacittc Tigers tomorrow night, in
Stanford's new $100,0(H) basketball pavilion.
It will be more than just an ordinary basketball game. The Cardinal
quintet will enter the fray determined to inaugurate the new building with a
clean-cut victory. The Methodists are invading the campus with the idea
of breaking up the program.
About a year ago "Swede" Righter, Cardinal basketball and gridiron star,
played forward on a surprised Stanford quintet that found itself outplayed by

the hitherto unheard of team from the
College of the Pacific. Righter and
his mates came back strong in the
last half, however, and beat the visit
ors.
Tomorrow night Righter will walk
on the basketball court, not as the
mainstay of the Stanford five, but as
the coach of the College of Pacific
Tigers. The Tiger five is the product
of Righter's first season as a basket
ball coach, and he has overlooked
nothing to turn out a strong team.
All of the Stanford basket shooters
came through Wednesday's contest un
scathed. Van Gent resumed his in
tensive drilling last night, running the
squad through plays and starting a
short practice game. There was a
light work-out today to put the men
on edge.
Just who will start against the Meth
odists is not yet determined. In all
probability the Davies-McHose com
bination at the forward positions
which worked well in the Mission
game will be used. Bob Janssen seems
to be the only one in the running at
center and the former freshman cap
tain is sure to play most of the game.
Richmond at running guard has started
off in mid-season form, and his shots
from the center of the court are find
ing the basket with regularity. De-
Groot, on account of his showing
against Santa Clara, has the call on
the standing guard position.
There are several promising players
who did not get a chance to play in
the opening fray, and if Stanford has
a comfortable lead. Van Gent will
probably send some of them in. Fred
Anderson who is making a great bid
for running guard is ready to go in
if anything should happen to Rich
mond. Van Gent has Smith, Pollard,
and Faville on reserve for standing
guard.
Cleaveland will probably relieve one
of the forwards for a time, and Howell
may be sent in for Janssen. "Lefty"
Rogers' knee will not. be in shape for
about a week. Van Gent said yester
day.
Little is known of the College of
Pacific team, save that two veterans,
Spoon and Captain Wagner, are back.
