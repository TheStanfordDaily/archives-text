# BABES DEFEAT PALO ALTO IN SOCCER, 1-0
## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon the freshman
soccer team sent the eleven from the
Palo Alto High School down to a 1-0
defeat in the first of a series of prac
tice games between the teams. Palo
Alto put up a good light and kept the j
Babes from scoring until late in the. last j
half. The freshmen showed form at j
times, but their lack of condition was :
evident.
After the game Ted Off was elected I
skipper of the squad for the coming sea
son. Off plays center-half and takes the
place of Ray ISaugh. who did not return
to school this quarter.
