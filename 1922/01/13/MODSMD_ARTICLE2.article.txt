# DR. ANDERSON GIVES TRANSLATION TO THE STANFORD COLLECTION
## 
### 
The first 390 editions of Dr. Ander
son'!- translation of the "Divina Corn
media" are out, and the thirty-lifth copy
lias been presented to the Library for
the Stanford collection. The volume is
beautifully bound in vellum and half
parchment, but the expense and value
of the book are rather due to the fact
that all the translation is 011 hand-made
paper. The price of this first edition is
$20. Each valume is signed by the au
thor.
The explanatory footnotes at the side
of the page, enable the reader to cover
the translation in a much shorter time
than would otherwise lie possible. As
J)r. Anderson himself states in his in
troduction the translation is written line
for line in the terza rima triple rime.
However, this does not mean that every
line of the original will be found in
the translation. He brings in a very in
teresting usage of the pronoun "though."
"I have spent a period of practically
twenty-one years at this work, but in
looking back over it the time seems very
-diort and I do not regret a single hour
of it." is the statement made by Dr.
Anderson in his introduction.
