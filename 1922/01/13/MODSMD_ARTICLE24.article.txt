# Duties and Discipline
## 
### 
Are duties a necessary part of freshman discipline?
Is it necessary to discipline a body of three or four
hundred men? These are questions that arise after
a survey of the present Stanford situation in regard
to entering students. Freshman discipline is strictly
forbidden by the rules of the University. That it is
still carried on surreptitiously is a generally recog
nized fact. ()rdinarily this curbing of the newcomer
is through physical punishments. Reason for anyone
wanting to discipline a freshman is found in the sys
tem.
The men who pass through their first year, sud
denly find themselves in a place of authority. The
upper classmen look to them to keep the freshmen in
line. This is because they went through the same
evolutionary process in their early college lives. Con
sequently, the sophomore finds himself in a position
where he can boss someone and get away with it
because he has the sanction of the older men. He
inadvertently drops into the groove in which so many
others have placed themselves before him.
On the other hand the freshman has a very good
point. Almost without exception the freshmen stand
ready to do anything reasonable that is asked of
them. But they do object to being bossed around by
someone who has no authority over them. It is a
case of "frosh do this" and "frosh do that." and
often the "this" and "that" is some errand for the
"master" sophomore.
Ridicule is one of the most powerful reducing
agents for a swelled head. If the freshman shows a
tendency to remark about his prep-school achieve
ments. if he has too much to say, if he doesn't show
the right attitude, he can easily be brought to his
senses if he is ridiculed properly. No man likes fc>
be made out a fool, and most of us dislike to have
our faults recalled or remarked upon. But it is often
a very efficient corrective, and in the case of the so
called "cocky" freshman it can well replace the duty
and discipline which tend to antagonize and increase
freshman headiness rather than to correct it.
