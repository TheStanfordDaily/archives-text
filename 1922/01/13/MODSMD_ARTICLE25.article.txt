# Not Being Done
## 
### 
Recognized rules of good sportsmanship were
broken by the spectators at the opening basketball
game last Wednesday night. It becomes a necessary
part of each baseketball season to remind those who
attend games that there are certain things that are
not countenanced at Stanford.
One rule is to refrain from smoking. There are
very good reasons why men should not smoke at a
basketball game. If the ordinary percentage of
smokers in a body of twelve or fifteen hundred spec
tators are to indulge, the air becomes so heavy with
the stale tobacco fumes that it affects the players.
The excessive smoking during the first game may
have had as much to do with the tired condition of
the players during the second period as the physical
efforts they were making. Basketball is more trying
to the wind of the participant than any other inter
collegiate sport. Yet the spectator unwittingly in
creases the difficulty for the players by filling the
auditorium with smoke. Many women attend the
games and out of courtesy to them the men should
refrain from smoking.
Several times during the course of the games
Wednesday the decisions of the referee were derided
and hooted. We are led to believe that the cat-calls
came from people outside the University. 1 he
vounger generation that attends the games is always
prone to "razz" the officials, but it is pretty generally
understood that Stanford students never take excep
tion to the decisions of officials. The officials are
human, and they are likely to make mistakes, but
good sportsmen always overlook them. Occasionally

a team does get a "raw deal." but when this occurs
the authorities who hire the official rarely employ
him a second time.
If one is close enough to the persons who is hoot
ing the officials, the offender should l>e reminded that
it is never done at Stanford. It is likely that he is
not a student in Stanford and therefore does not
know the ethics of Stanford sportsmanship. A quiet
word, well spoken, will cause the discontinuance of
both smoking and hooting.
