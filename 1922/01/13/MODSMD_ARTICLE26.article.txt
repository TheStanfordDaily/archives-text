Couldn't work that here. To many guys would try

Where History Fails
Since the days of old Columbus, in the time of Caesar,
too.
History has often told us of the things they used to do,
How the ancients had their battles, where they held
them, and how long.
Bards and poets have acclaimed them with much epic,
verse, and song.
But a little bit of doubting has been troubling me of
late,
In my studying of History, there's one thing they don't
relate.
And I think that I should mention it, to say the very
least,
How could these ancients be so bold without their daily
yeast?
If Alexander crossed the Alps, and captured fallen
Rome,
He could have done so many things, before returning
home,
If he had had a cake of yeast, each morning when he
rose,
He might have conquered all the world, and led it by
the nose.
And so I'm searching History, thru all its written
lines,
To find just where the ancients got their yeast-made
vitamines.

Life's Tragedies:—Alexius Caesar Napoleon Squibb
was heartbroken. As he stood in the cabbage patch,
looking down at the prostrate form of his seventh wife,
he wept bitter tears. He always did this when his wife
died. But he had only himself to blame. He should
liave known better! Bowed with grief and rheumatism,
he stood looking at her still form and the tears rolled
down his cheeks, and dropped splattering from liis chin.
This was a hard blow to a man of his years. As he
stood there, he thought back over the six months that
she had been with him. He thought of how he had
first been attracted to her by the garlic soup that she
was famous for. He thought of their life in the little
cottage; how she had gotten up at 4 a.m., cooked his
breakfast, cleaned the house, gone to market with the
vegetables, and then come back to cultivate the little
garden. It was sad! He would never get as capable
wife again. As she lies there among the cabbages and
turnips, how peaceful and motionless she looks. . .
what!. . . look! She breathes, she stands up, she speaks
in a dazed way! A-h-h-h-h-h-h!
"Oh, Alexius, I'm sorry. 1 was so sleepy I just had to
have a nap."

the following:
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
Poppies are yellow,
And so are dandilions.

Cabbages has prepared a list of rules for those hop
ing to attend the dance in the Basketball Pavilion,
tonight.
* * *
For the Snake:
Rule 1. —Better stay away. The shock of going into
a dance without parting with a dollar and a dime might
prove fatal.
Rule 2. —If you do go, wear your old clothes. It is
impossible to rush the food line to the best advantage
when wearing a dress suit. Ask any one at the Cot
tillion.
Rule 3. —Drink punch with moderation. If you haven't
any, use the ladle.
Rule 4.—See rule one.
For the Rough:
Rule 1 to 6 (inclusive). —Come! This will be the only
dance ever given in the Pavilion where it will he un
necessary to tear down the decorations in order to en
joy the evening.
Rule 7. All roughs will bo consigned to the balcony.
However, this hns its compensations. For example,
in case you see a hated rival below you. drop a cigar
ette on him. If he doesn't like it, give him a cold stare.
