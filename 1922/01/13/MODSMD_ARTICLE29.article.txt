# OK PROBLEMS ARE DISCUSSED BY BOARD

### 
At the instance of the Social Service
. Hoard representatives of various philan-
I thropic organizations which have con
ducted campaigns for money among the
students of the University, met yester
day afternoon and thoroughly discussed
the whole drive system as at present
utilized in such campaigns. Student rep
resentatives were present and through
Dan Evans, '20, president of the Asso
ciated Students, formulated their objec
tions.
It was the general opinion of all at
the meeting that, since Stanford is an
institution training students for service
to the world, care should be exercised
that students should not be trained to
indifference to world needs but that, on
the other hand, they should be encour
aged to weigh the merits of various ap
peals that come to them, to contribute
to such as they can, but to say no when
necessary with self respect though with
I regret. Practically all those /presenit
I condemned some of the evils which are
i the outcome of the war, including the
| house-to-house, intensive campaign
j methods with the competitive group sys
j tem, and the opinion was voiced that
such methods build up a habit of mind
! indiscriminately opposed to all charitable
efforts and produces an indifference
j which all desire to guard against.
