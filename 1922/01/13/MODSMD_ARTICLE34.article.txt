### 
Dt.lt a Upsilon basketballers staged a
strong comeback in the second half of
â–  their intramural contest with HI Campo
last night and won a 21-6 victory. The
five representing Sequoia 2 deft/tlcd
Kappa Alpha, 11-0.
In the first period of the game be
tween HI Campo and Delta Upsilon, the
latter team showed no signs of running
up a large score. At half time, HI Cam-
Ipo led by one point, 6-5. However, in
the last half, the HI Campo players were
I unable to make a tally.
The entrance of Lacey, D. U., for
ward, started the scoring parade in the
I second part of the contest. Delta L'p
I silon took the lead in the first minute
'of play when Lacey dribbled the ball
down the court and tossed it through
the hoop. This was followed in short
I order by another basket by Lacey and
i one by Black, giving the I). I . quintet
la five-point advantage. This flash seemed
|to demoralize the HI Campo men. and
j they were unable to offer effective op
position. The losing team had a rather
I weak defense.
Laccv. Reinhold. and Black worked
together and kept the hall in HI Campo
j territory most of the time. A constant
shooting for the basket was about as
much responsible for points as skill.
Lacey and Black threw three baskets
each, with the former adding three points
on free throws. The forwards were
aided by Atwill. who played a stellar
game as running guard. Atwill will re
covered the ball consistently and made
two baskets from mid-court.
Sequoia had a decided edge on the
Kappa Alpha team throughout the con
test. The Kappa Alpha were not in a
good condition as the winners, and the
Sequoia basketers clearly showed that
! they have improved considerably since
' their last game. Hvers. Kauffman. and
! Sumtnerfield formed the point-winning
combination for Sequoia.
Alpha Tan Omega advance into the
! next round by forfeit.
