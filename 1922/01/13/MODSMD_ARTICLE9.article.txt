### 
"There i.- a conspiracy on the part oi
the old to keep youth down Kvcn in
educating us they plot against us," says
Austin Bevans, six feet of Greek-god
: ishness, to his pals. "There's Dave, who
| wanted to be a farmer studying for the
bar. Look at George, whose parents
j made an accountant of him when he
1 wanted to be a violinist. Glance at thi
exhibit. 1 wanted to be a teacher. What
am I—an automobile salesman !"
It is a dark moment in "The Charm
School." the coming Masquers' produc
tion. George, has lost his job, the Simp
kins twins have had their allowance
stopped and Austin has not only lost
his fiancee but also an invitation to din
ner. The bachelor apartment, less tact
fully called "garret," is filled with woe
and very little food.
George, played by John Vaughn, 24,
is wholeheartedly in sympathy with any
plan to condemn families, which seem
to be generally considered in a bad way
at the time. His taught him no music
so he could scarcely play a violin and
encouraged his sleeping habit to such an
extent, in his youth, that he lias lost
what ability he had as an accountant. lie
| says. Such a condition complicated with
a sharp-pointed visor. This year the
men are receiving sliding pads, shoes. !
and gloves, something which has never ;
been done for Cardinal baseball squads j
before.
Floyd Kallam and his squad of about [
thirty-five yearling diamond men have
j been out this week and are laying the
| ground work for taking a scalp when
they open the season against Palo Alt')
I High on February 25. Kallam is dril
ling his men for the first week or so]
by the good old methor of "laying em j
down." He says their arms art.- not in
| condition for much throwing ve.t and I
the hunting practice will loosen up both
arms and hitting machinery.
The freshmen will not have new suits
j this season but will receive new socks ;
land caps. Kallam is of the opinion that
the money which would be spent on j
suits can be put to better advantage by j
getting a supply of halls. Work lias not
been started 011 the freshman diamond !
as yet, but it is to be started within a <
week or so and the plan is to skin the
turf from the infield and put it into j
equal condition with the varsitv diamond. 1
