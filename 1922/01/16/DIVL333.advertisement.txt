HUNGARIAN ROYAL PALACE
BUDAPEST. HUNGARY
Most of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators
EVERY part of this Beautiful Palace was
designed and built by Hungarians—
except one. This was the elevator
installation.
When they needed elevators in keeping with
this structure of white Hungarian marble
and sandstone, there was only one firm
considered —the international firm of Otis.
Two passenger elevators were supplied, and
in those days they were used by the Emper
or, members of the Royal Household, and
guests.
That was more than twenty years ago.
Otis was then the leader in the elevator
industry, as Otis is now.
In palaces of kings, in the greatest and the
tallest office buildings of the world, in resi
dences, ships, towers, theatres—everywhere
where vertical transportation is required, you
will find Otis Elevators—the safest and most
efficient of all.

HUNGARIAN ROYAL PALACE
BUDAPEST. HUNGARY
Most of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators
EVERY part of this Beautiful Palace was
designed and built by Hungarians—
except one. This was the elevator
installation.
When they needed elevators in keeping with
this structure of white Hungarian marble
and sandstone, there was only one firm
considered —the international firm of Otis.
Two passenger elevators were supplied, and
in those days they were used by the Emper
or, members of the Royal Household, and
guests.
That was more than twenty years ago.
Otis was then the leader in the elevator
industry, as Otis is now.
In palaces of kings, in the greatest and the
tallest office buildings of the world, in resi
dences, ships, towers, theatres—everywhere
where vertical transportation is required, you
will find Otis Elevators—the safest and most
efficient of all.
