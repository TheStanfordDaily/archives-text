# VARSITY QUINTET WINS FIRST BOUT IN PAVILION
## Davies-McHose Combination Takes Lead in First Minutes of Play; Pacific Held to Four Field Goals 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
It was no difficult task for the Stanford varsity basketball team to subdm
the College of Pacific Tigers last Saturday night, and the opening contest i:i

Davies-McHose Combination Stars

It fell to the lot of Captain Davies
to throw the first basket of the game,
a pretty shot after a hit of fast passing
under the Methodists' goal. It was
Davies also who tossed in a free throw
for the final point. In the meantime he
occupied himself by Jthrowing nine out
of eleven free throws, and by shooting
another field goal. The Cardinal leader
scored fourteen of the thirty points for
his team.
"Nip" McHose, at the other forward
position, with seven field goals, added
another fourteen points to the total. The
Davies-McHose combination made plenty
of trouble for the College of Pacific
guards, who spent most of the time try
ing to locate the lightning Cardinal for
wards.

Stanford Quintet Improved

There was marked improvement, both
on the offense and defense, in the play
of the varsity quintet. The. Four-man
defense stopped short the Methodist at
tack, and the Tigers chalked up only
four field goals during the whole game.
Three of these four were made on long
shots.
The short passing between Davies,
McHose, Janssen, and Richmond, on the
other hand, pierced the College of Pa
cific defense frequently. The Cardinals
made no attempt at long range shooting,
but waited until they were close to the
basket.

Wagner Has Good Eye

Most of the Methodist team except
Wagner, guard, and Keeney. forward,
might as well have stayed at home as
far as the scoring was concerned. Wag-
ner dropped in thirteen out of sixteen
free throws, and Keener scored three
field goals. Spoon, who we.nt in at guard
! in the second half, got one basket.

!
j Cardinal Takes Lead Early

McHose and Davies, with three field
goals and one free throw, put the Cardi- i
nal on the end of a 7 to .l score in j
the first three minutes of play. Mc- !
Hose dribbled the length of the court}
and added two more, and Davies put in I
another free throw. Wagner converted i
three, fouls for the College of Pacific,
bringing the count to 10 to 4. Keeney. I
Tiger forward, about two minutes be- j
fore the close of the period, made the
field goal for the Methodists. Jan-sen
broke into the point column a minute
later. The score at half-time was 18J
to 8.

Enter Mr. Spoon

The entrance of Eddie Spoon, star,
guard on the Methodist quintet of last j
! ye.ar, shortly after the second period;
| started, was the signal for a new lease
|of life on the part of the Pacific five, j
j The Cardinal offense was stopped for 1
the first time, and Wagner made count j
I the numerous technical fouls called on I
' Stanford. The play slowed up some
what with neither team able to score ex- j
cept by the foul route. McHose slipped
I over a tally and a moment later one of j
Spoon's long shots found the basket,
making the score 29 to 18. Keeney and
Wagner tallied three more for Pacific, j
and Davies made the final point for the
Cardinal.

Davies-McHose Combination Stars

It fell to the lot of Captain Davies
to throw the first basket of the game,
a pretty shot after a hit of fast passing
under the Methodists' goal. It was
Davies also who tossed in a free throw
for the final point. In the meantime he
occupied himself by Jthrowing nine out
of eleven free throws, and by shooting
another field goal. The Cardinal leader
scored fourteen of the thirty points for
his team.
"Nip" McHose, at the other forward
position, with seven field goals, added
another fourteen points to the total. The
Davies-McHose combination made plenty
of trouble for the College of Pacific
guards, who spent most of the time try
ing to locate the lightning Cardinal for
wards.

Stanford Quintet Improved

There was marked improvement, both
on the offense and defense, in the play
of the varsity quintet. The. Four-man
defense stopped short the Methodist at
tack, and the Tigers chalked up only
four field goals during the whole game.
Three of these four were made on long
shots.
The short passing between Davies,
McHose, Janssen, and Richmond, on the
other hand, pierced the College of Pa
cific defense frequently. The Cardinals
made no attempt at long range shooting,
but waited until they were close to the
basket.

Wagner, guard, and Keeney. forward,

lege of Pacific—Spoon for Spradley,
Stevens for Martin, Referee: Kerns.
It was no difficult task for the Stanford varsity basketball team to subdm
the College of Pacific Tigers last Saturday night, and the opening contest i:i
the new pavilion went to the Cardinal, 3' 1 to 21.
History failed to repeat itself in this particular instance, for the
crowd which have e.ver witnessed a basketball game here, estimated at 2,. r ;i!0.
saw none of the sensational plays.which marked the contest between the two
quintets a year ago.
Van Gent's proteges had the Tigers well tamed in the first half, holding

them to a lone field goal and to a 18
used the intermission to good effect,

o 8 score. Coach Righter must have
or in the final period the Tiger five
showed signs of ferocity, and gave the
varsity a hard light.

Davies-McHose Combination Stars

It fell to the lot of Captain Davies
to throw the first basket of the game,
a pretty shot after a hit of fast passing
under the Methodists' goal. It was
Davies also who tossed in a free throw
for the final point. In the meantime he
occupied himself by Jthrowing nine out
of eleven free throws, and by shooting
another field goal. The Cardinal leader
scored fourteen of the thirty points for
his team.
"Nip" McHose, at the other forward
position, with seven field goals, added
another fourteen points to the total. The
Davies-McHose combination made plenty
of trouble for the College of Pacific
guards, who spent most of the time try
ing to locate the lightning Cardinal for
wards.

Stanford Quintet Improved

There was marked improvement, both
on the offense and defense, in the play
of the varsity quintet. The. Four-man
defense stopped short the Methodist at
tack, and the Tigers chalked up only
four field goals during the whole game.
Three of these four were made on long
shots.
The short passing between Davies,
McHose, Janssen, and Richmond, on the
other hand, pierced the College of Pa
cific defense frequently. The Cardinals
made no attempt at long range shooting,
but waited until they were close to the
basket.

Wagner Has Good Eye

Most of the Methodist team except
Wagner, guard, and Keeney. forward,
might as well have stayed at home as
far as the scoring was concerned. Wag-
ner dropped in thirteen out of sixteen
free throws, and Keener scored three
field goals. Spoon, who we.nt in at guard
! in the second half, got one basket.

!
j Cardinal Takes Lead Early

McHose and Davies, with three field
goals and one free throw, put the Cardi- i
nal on the end of a 7 to .l score in j
the first three minutes of play. Mc- !
Hose dribbled the length of the court}
and added two more, and Davies put in I
another free throw. Wagner converted i
three, fouls for the College of Pacific,
bringing the count to 10 to 4. Keeney. I
Tiger forward, about two minutes be- j
fore the close of the period, made the
field goal for the Methodists. Jan-sen
broke into the point column a minute
later. The score at half-time was 18J
to 8.

Enter Mr. Spoon

The entrance of Eddie Spoon, star,
guard on the Methodist quintet of last j
! ye.ar, shortly after the second period;
| started, was the signal for a new lease
|of life on the part of the Pacific five, j
j The Cardinal offense was stopped for 1
the first time, and Wagner made count j
I the numerous technical fouls called on I
' Stanford. The play slowed up some
what with neither team able to score ex- j
cept by the foul route. McHose slipped
I over a tally and a moment later one of j
Spoon's long shots found the basket,
making the score 29 to 18. Keeney and
Wagner tallied three more for Pacific, j
and Davies made the final point for the
Cardinal.
