It was no difficult task for the Stanford varsity basketball team to subdm
the College of Pacific Tigers last Saturday night, and the opening contest i:i
the new pavilion went to the Cardinal, 3' 1 to 21.
History failed to repeat itself in this particular instance, for the

quintets a year ago.
Van Gent's proteges had the Tigers well tamed in the first half, holding

them to a lone field goal and to a 18

varsity a hard light.

Davies-McHose Combination Stars

It fell to the lot of Captain Davies
to throw the first basket of the game,
a pretty shot after a hit of fast passing
under the Methodists' goal. It was
Davies also who tossed in a free throw
for the final point. In the meantime he
occupied himself by Jthrowing nine out
of eleven free throws, and by shooting
another field goal. The Cardinal leader
scored fourteen of the thirty points for
his team.
"Nip" McHose, at the other forward
position, with seven field goals, added
another fourteen points to the total. The
Davies-McHose combination made plenty
of trouble for the College of Pacific
guards, who spent most of the time try
ing to locate the lightning Cardinal for
wards.

Stanford Quintet Improved

There was marked improvement, both
on the offense and defense, in the play
of the varsity quintet. The. Four-man
defense stopped short the Methodist at
tack, and the Tigers chalked up only
four field goals during the whole game.
Three of these four were made on long
shots.
The short passing between Davies,
McHose, Janssen, and Richmond, on the
other hand, pierced the College of Pa

made no attempt at long range shooting,
but waited until they were close to the
basket.

far as the scoring was concerned. Wag-
