# BABE COURT TEAM IS BEATEN BY COMMERCE
## Freshman Basketers Lose to High School Team 17-20 in Opening Game in Pavilion 
### Henry Mack, '24 
The Stanford freshman basketball five
was defeated by the Commerce High
School of San Francisco by a score of
; 17-20 in the basketball pavilion Satur
] day night.
Seemingly dazed by the responsibility
[of playing the first game in Stanford's
! new pavilion, the Babe team was unable
to demonstrate even the ability to pass
i the ball or to know what to do with it
after receiving it. Time after time the
lighter high school team took the ball
| from the bewildered freshmen, and poor
| shooting on their part was all that pre
: vented the score from mounting higher.
Only during the first five minutes did
j the freshmen exhibit any concerted ac
tion. During this period they scored
four field goals, three of them being
j made by Alexander. A long shot from
the side of the court by Lawless. Com
| merce High School forward, unbalanced
[ the Babes, and teamwork was forgot-
I ten. Two more field goals by Middle
| ton, Stanford center, were scored before
the end of the half. Lawless and Paynter
of Commerce scoring three. The half
ended 12-9 in favor of the freshmen.
The rest period seemed to disorganize
the Babes completely. The prep men
scored two goals in rapid succession, and
i were given ample opportunity to score
| more, but inaccuracy in shooting pre-
I vented them from adding to the score.
I During this period Middleton secured
j two goals from field, and Alexander
I scored one foul shot. Lawless and Payn-
J tc.r scored four field goals and Lawless j
i tossed three fouls.
The last five minutes of play found :
; the Babes .following the ball around the I
court, securing possession, and then
either passing to a Commerce High man j
or failing to attempt a shot until it was:
i too late.
i Lawless of Commerce was the out
standing player of the game, scoring lif
i teen of the visitors' twenty points, and
j proving himself a strong man on de
fense. Alexander was the only Babe
player who showed much ability to ban
die himself on the tloor. Although close
ly guarded, he scored seven points, and
I broke up many of the high school shots,
i Middleton was outjumped at center
by Paynter. and often failed to get rid
lof the ball when given opportunity to
shoot. Houck at standing guard was
prevented from playing the steady game
that he is capable of by the erratic sup
port he received from his team mates.
Hoffman, who played opposite. Alex
ander in the Palo Alto High School
game, and who seems better able to
work with Alexander than Sliipke, was
out of the running because of an injury
j to his leg.
The crying need of the Babe team is
'teamwork and accurate shooting. Alex
ander missed five fouls out of six tries
I and Sliipke failed three times in three.
The lineups : Stanford—Alexander
and Sliipke, forwards: Middleton, ceti
jter; Wisely and Houck, guards.
Commerce 11 it>h School—Kennedy and

The Stanford freshman basketball five
was defeated by the Commerce High
School of San Francisco by a score of
; 17-20 in the basketball pavilion Satur
] day night.
Seemingly dazed by the responsibility
[of playing the first game in Stanford's
! new pavilion, the Babe team was unable
to demonstrate even the ability to pass
i the ball or to know what to do with it
after receiving it. Time after time the
lighter high school team took the ball
| from the bewildered freshmen, and poor
| shooting on their part was all that pre
: vented the score from mounting higher.
Only during the first five minutes did
j the freshmen exhibit any concerted ac
tion. During this period they scored
four field goals, three of them being
j made by Alexander. A long shot from
the side of the court by Lawless. Com
| merce High School forward, unbalanced
[ the Babes, and teamwork was forgot-
I ten. Two more field goals by Middle
| ton, Stanford center, were scored before
the end of the half. Lawless and Paynter
of Commerce scoring three. The half
ended 12-9 in favor of the freshmen.
The rest period seemed to disorganize
the Babes completely. The prep men
scored two goals in rapid succession, and
i were given ample opportunity to score
| more, but inaccuracy in shooting pre-
I vented them from adding to the score.
I During this period Middleton secured
j two goals from field, and Alexander
I scored one foul shot. Lawless and Payn-
J tc.r scored four field goals and Lawless j
i tossed three fouls.
The last five minutes of play found :
; the Babes .following the ball around the I
court, securing possession, and then
either passing to a Commerce High man j
or failing to attempt a shot until it was:
i too late.
i Lawless of Commerce was the out
standing player of the game, scoring lif
i teen of the visitors' twenty points, and
j proving himself a strong man on de
fense. Alexander was the only Babe
player who showed much ability to ban
die himself on the tloor. Although close
ly guarded, he scored seven points, and
I broke up many of the high school shots,
i Middleton was outjumped at center
by Paynter. and often failed to get rid
lof the ball when given opportunity to
shoot. Houck at standing guard was
prevented from playing the steady game
that he is capable of by the erratic sup
port he received from his team mates.
Hoffman, who played opposite. Alex
ander in the Palo Alto High School
game, and who seems better able to
work with Alexander than Sliipke, was
out of the running because of an injury
j to his leg.
The crying need of the Babe team is
'teamwork and accurate shooting. Alex
