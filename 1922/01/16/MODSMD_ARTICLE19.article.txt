Stanford spirit, that indefinable something that
prompts the students of this institution to achieve,
is implanted in the minds and hearts of the freshmen
by duties and discipline, and its growth would be les
sened by a decrease in duties imposed on the fresh
man, according to the sophomores.
They £° 0,1 t° explain that freshmen who are
working are usually excused from work on the vari
ous'projects assigned to them or are required to
put in a very few hours. Since the class of men who
earn part or all of their money to stay in college
numbers approximately one hundred in each class,
there are at least one hundred men or more each year
whose training is neglected and who, as a conse
quence, go through their entire course without the
proper spirit.
The case for exaggerated discipline and duty then
does not hold. So long as the freshman wears his
dink, does not smoke cigarettes, turns out for ath
letic contests and participates in an activity of some
kind he shows that he has the proper attitude. If, in
addition, he enough to maintain passing
grades he will stay here long enough to be a real
Stanford man.
There are certain things that freshmen .are called
upon to do that are regarded as first-year enter
prises. One of these is the building of the bon
fire. The hours of co-operation in building the pyre
and the subsequent hours spent around the fires on
guard duty allow the freshmen to become acquainted
with each other and go far toward creating a spirit
of fellowship. The abuse in building the bonfire
comes from the efforts of each succeeding sopoho
more class, which has the supervision of its con
struction, to build a greater pile than the class that
preceded it. Some day a sophomore class will real
ize that a fire that will burn for twenty minutes or
more, long enough to allow the men of the Univer
sity to serpentine around it until they are exhausted
from their own enthusiasms, is all that is really
necessary, and the efforts to outstrip the class of the
year before in building will be stopped. A standard
for bonfires will be established that will require a
minimum ol hours from the freshmen who perform
the actual work, and the period of guarding, which
is regarded by many as one of the events of college
life, will be maintained and fellowship will be pro
moted.
The underclass fights, the tie-up, and poster fight
have this same effect of unifying the classes. The
freshmen usually find their places in the scale of
University life in these two encounters. Is it neces
sary to remind them constantly throughout the year
by making them servants of the sophomores?

preceded it. Some day a sophomore class will real
ize that a fire that will burn for twenty minutes or
more, long enough to allow the men of the Univer
sity to serpentine around it until they are exhausted
from their own enthusiasms, is all that is really
necessary, and the efforts to outstrip the class of the
year before in building will be stopped. A standard
for bonfires will be established that will require a
minimum ol hours from the freshmen who perform
the actual work, and the period of guarding, which
is regarded by many as one of the events of college
life, will be maintained and fellowship will be pro

The underclass fights, the tie-up, and poster fight

Stanford spirit, that indefinable something that
prompts the students of this institution to achieve,
is implanted in the minds and hearts of the freshmen
by duties and discipline, and its growth would be les
sened by a decrease in duties imposed on the fresh
man, according to the sophomores.
They £° 0,1 t° explain that freshmen who are
working are usually excused from work on the vari
ous'projects assigned to them or are required to
put in a very few hours. Since the class of men who
earn part or all of their money to stay in college
numbers approximately one hundred in each class,
there are at least one hundred men or more each year
whose training is neglected and who, as a conse
quence, go through their entire course without the
proper spirit.
The case for exaggerated discipline and duty then
does not hold. So long as the freshman wears his
dink, does not smoke cigarettes, turns out for ath
letic contests and participates in an activity of some
kind he shows that he has the proper attitude. If, in
addition, he enough to maintain passing
grades he will stay here long enough to be a real
Stanford man.
There are certain things that freshmen .are called
upon to do that are regarded as first-year enter
prises. One of these is the building of the bon
fire. The hours of co-operation in building the pyre
and the subsequent hours spent around the fires on
guard duty allow the freshmen to become acquainted
with each other and go far toward creating a spirit
of fellowship. The abuse in building the bonfire
comes from the efforts of each succeeding sopoho
more class, which has the supervision of its con
struction, to build a greater pile than the class that
preceded it. Some day a sophomore class will real
ize that a fire that will burn for twenty minutes or
more, long enough to allow the men of the Univer
sity to serpentine around it until they are exhausted
