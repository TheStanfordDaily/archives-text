first episode by thrilling out the motif with a long,
strained expression. This was caught up by the second
string violin, and the rest of the works opened up at

waves. Two fire alarms were turned in at the post
office, and it is rumored that three people in the front
row died of heart failure.
"Half time was called when they had finished the
'Life of a Fig Tree,' by Meddlesome, from his 'Under
tow,'' Vol. 7, p. 67. The 'Dance of the Lincoln Pennies'
was a charming little faux pas, illustrating the deep
romance of the strings. Gavionni Migotto, by way of
an added attraction, knocked the celeste for a few
-loops, and the program ended with grand burst as the
climax of a stirring Chinese Funeral Marc h was reached.
"This was the last concert A. Hurts will give here for
