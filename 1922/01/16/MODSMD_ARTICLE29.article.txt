# COMMENCEMENT WEEK PLANS TAKING SHAPE
## 
### 
Plans leading *ip to the formation of
the commencement program are already
I taking shape, among the members of sen
ior class. President Grant Corby and
; Robert Connolly, treasurer, are at work
| investigating possible means of swelling
j tire class budget, in order to cover the
incidental expenses which will be in
; curred between now and the end of the
spring quarter.
It is the.'hope of the senior class of
ficers that the interest and co-operatian
of every graduate member may be en
listed in carrying out the remainder of
the year's program, and that their sup-
I port may be unanimous in making pos
sible a successful senior week.
