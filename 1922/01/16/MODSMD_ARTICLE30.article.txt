The quantity of copper wire in an ;
elevator motor and controller?
It is interesting to know the amount
of wire in the motors and controllers |
ot two of the largest installations in
New York City—The Singer Building
and the Hudson Terminal Building.
I The former installation consists of
fifteen Otis Gearless Traction Ele- ;
i vators. The total length of wire in!
i the motors and controllers, not includ- j
j ing any of the hatchway wiring is 456
| miles, or about fourteen tons of copper i
j wire.
The latter installation consists of
thirty-nine Otis Gearless Traction Ele
j vators and the total length of wire in
the motors and controllers, not includ
ing any hatchway wiring, is 1118 miles,
'or about thirty-six tons of copper wire.
In other words, the wire in the
motors and controllers of these two
equipments, if in one continuous
length, would reach from New York
City to Chicago and almost back
again. —Advt.
