## 
### 
Twelve well known women painters of

has contributed from one to four pic
tures for the collection.
In speaking of the exhibit. Pedro Le
mos, director of the Art Gallery and
Museum, stated: "This is undoubtedly
the first time in California art history
that a prominent gallery has featured
the wofk of women painters alone, and
it has been so enthusiastically responded
by women artists, that favorable con
sideration is being given toward estab
lishing one month each year iyr a regu
for "Women Artists Annual Exhibition
of Paintings at Stanford."
The display this month includes paint
ings by Jessie Arms Botke, who is well
known in Chicago for her decorative
paintings, two of which received pur
chase prizes and now hang in the Chi
cago Art Institute. *Her five murals in
the Memorial Hall of the
University of Chicago have also iden
tified her as a prominent artist of Amer
ica. Mrs. Botke lives in Carmel and is
now devoting her time to California
subjects.
The portrait artist. Celia Seymour,
shows four subjects, among them being
a portrait of Otis Skinner, the actor, and
another of Senator Kahn. Miss Sey
mour's work has been characterized by
many as possessing attractiveness, spon
taniety. fidelity of likeness and charm.
Palo Alto is represented by the paint
ings of three of its artists. Elizabeth
Norton, the noted sculptress, has sent
three water colors of landscapes. The
other two women are. Mrs. J. V. Can
non and Mrs. W. H. Shockley. The
former, whose work was here last
month, is a depictor of outdoor sub
jects, and the latter has two still life
groups and a hollyhock screen on dis-

pi ay.
Miss deNealc Morgan, generally
known in tempera, is exhibiting oil
paintings in this collection. I!er work
shows a rugged, hold treatment and is
of subjects familiar to her—the old cy
press and rugged coast around Carmel.
Cora Boone, in her water-color still -
lifes. presents a group unusual and di
rect in arrangement and color.
Children playing in the sand or water
bv the waves are the subjects of • the
three Alice B. Chittenden paintings. The
vibrating out-of-doors is expressed.
These pictures are as distinctive, as Mrs.
Chittenden's flower sketches through
which she established her art ability in
the past.
