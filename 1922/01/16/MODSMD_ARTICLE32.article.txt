Lloyd George had a "conversation" re
garding the Anglo-French pact, at
which the British premier gave Poincare
to understand that Britain was especially
interested in reduction of France's naval
and submarine aspirations as a first con

EUROPE TO RECOGNIZE OBREGON
It was unofficially announced at the
Mexican embassy that Kngland. France,
and Italy had recognized the Obregon I
government. Opinion in this country j
has steadily grown that the present ;jov- j
ernment should be recognized. The j
business people fear that their European j
rivals will get a good start in Mexico i
unless the United States recognizes
Obregon government.
ANGLO-IRISH TREATY RATIFIED
The provisional government off Ire
land, with Collins at the head, -igned |
the ratifications, which were then im- |
mediately forwarded to Dublin Castle.
The Ulsterites are still refusing to put i
the Royal decree into force, but are send- j
ing the Sinn Fein political prisoners to |
the Britisli authorities in Southern ire
land for disposal. Preparations are j
proceeding rapidly to take over the Dub- j
lin Castle from the British at an early j
date.
NAVAL TREATY READY OR APPROVAL
The naval treaty was distributed to |
the Pacific ratifications clause omitted
tlie members of the conference, with
pending Japan's assent thereto. This
week's program includes approval of. I
naval disarmament treaty; the probable j
conclusion of the Shantung negotations, j
and the resumption of the Far Eastern |
sittings to complete the draft of the |
nine-power Far Eastern treaty.
SINO-JAPANESE DEADLOCK
CONTINUES
Despite attempts to sidetrack the is-I
sue China has intimated that she will
insist on the abrogation of the twenty
one demands of 1915, as they made
China a vassal state. Japan, on the
other hand, opposes this move on the j
ground of its being alien to the purposes '
of the conference. The Hughes-Bal- i
four suggestions for a compromise on j
the Shantung issue are expected today.
TROUBLE GROWS IN EGYPT
AND INDIA
Trouble in- Egypt which began by the
shooting of two Britisli soldiers in Cairo
has spread over the country. Heavy
casualties arc reported on both sides.
The government officials are reported to
have "struck work." The British mean
while have despatched naval units to
Suez, Port Said, and Alexandria, and
gunboats manned by the Royal Navy are
proceeding up the Nile.
In India, Gandhi is still in power, and ,
determined to carry out his program of
"civil disobedience." The Prince of
Wales is received everywhere by closed [
shops and empty streets. The Viceroy 1
has temporarily rejected the proposal for j
a round table meeting between the gov- j
eminent and the nationalists. Repres
sion meanwhile is in full swing; the ar- |
re-ts of the leaders have been like fuel !
to the discontent among the rank and j
file. The situation is tense.
