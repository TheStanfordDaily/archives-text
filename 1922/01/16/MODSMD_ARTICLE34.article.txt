That the desire for "willowy forms"
is leading many young women in Cali
fornia educational institutions to
starvation is the astonishing conclu
sion of A. C. Olney, State Superin-
I tendent of Secondary Education, who
has been called upon to investigate
j conditions in schools,- where, in the
midst of plenty, school girls are mal
nourished and are in a virtual state
jof starvation.
His investigation shows that the
"diet-craze" and the feminine desire
to be "willowy" have brought about
the present condition, many young
women omitting breakfast entirely, or
making a meal on an apple or an
! orange, believing that they are bene
-1 fiting their form thereby.
J "Better health habits are what the
school authorities want," states Olney.
These cannot be brought about if mal
nutrition exists. "Some girls are in
clined to be stout, but even in the
case of the stout girl, starvation meth
-1 ods are not necessary. What is re
commended is plenty of food and well
j balanced meals, with the proper
amount of exercise in between. Under
| this method the girl is scientifically
assured that she will obtain a full
measure oP health, rosy cheeks and
the charm which she seeks,
i "If anything," states Olney, "the
daughters of rich parents are more
susceptible to the starvation route to
beauty than are the daughters of poor
families, with the result that the lat
ter are probably the better fed now
a-days."
