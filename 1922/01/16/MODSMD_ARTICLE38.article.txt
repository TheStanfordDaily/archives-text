# LEGION TIES CARDS 2-2 IN A PRACTICE MEET ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
Couch Harry Maloney's soccer squad '
had a stiff workout Saturday afternoon!
when the American Legion, Post No. |
52, held the Stanford players to a 2-2
tie in a practice game on the Palo .\!to }
| Community House turf. This is the I
: second game in which the Cardinals j
j have been unable to outscore the sc.] |
dier-, and it puts the spot-light on or.<- 1
of the strong teams in the soccer league. '
, The Legion men play fast ball, many of j
the players being former Stanford stu-,
j dents who have made their letter in that [
sport.
The game showed two weakness in |
the Cardinal team, namely: the lack of i
j real team work, and a lack of strength
in the backiield. Hayes, who played in
one of the fullback positions during the
first part of the season, is not out for
soccer this quarter, and Mendonca, the
other fullback, has been temporarily
transferred to the position of center
j forward, taking the place of Pcavy, who ,
is out for varsity baseball. The for
wards, however, have been strengthened
by the addition of Green, a former var
! sity man who" has returned to Stanford
this quarter. Robinson has also re
turned to school and is out for the
| game. He fills up a gap in the half
back line, giving the Stanford team
probably the best set of halfbacks in
the University and Club Soccer League.
;The fullback positions are still open,
and Maloney is giving several men a
try for these defensive places. With
I these positions filled with the right men.
| the Cards should end up in the top po-
I sition in the league.
