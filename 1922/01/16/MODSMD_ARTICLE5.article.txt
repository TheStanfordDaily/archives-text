Oilers of assistance in the "First Mil
j lion for Stanford" endowment campaign
I are pouring into President Wilbur's of
| lice as a result of the announcement a
| few days ago. 1 his is the first time, the
: University has ever called for linancial
i aid, and friends and alumni of Stanford
are responding largely.
T he news of the University's pressing
need for funds has come, as a surprise
to the public generally. Stanford has
| long been regarded as an institution m>
| abundantly endowed as to be beyond any
! want whatsoever. But tlic University's
| adherents have been quick to point out
I that, while great universities of the
country have been built up around an
initial endowment, in almost every in
stance such endowments have been ac
cepted as the basis for others. The lirst
gift to Stanford has remained the only
source of revenue.
Stanford's wealth lias for a long time
been a myth. As far back as 1914, the
president's report showed financial limi
tations. President Wilbur, in bis report
lof 1918-1919, brought the matter to a
j crux, showed Stanford's necessities and
outlined a plan for the future. Follow
ing this came the General Education
Board's $300,000 offer last June, the
unanimous endorsement of the. plan by
alumni representatives, 'and finally the
students' offer to take the lead in the
campaign.
