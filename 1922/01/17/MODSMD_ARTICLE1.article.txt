# CARDINAL TEAM MEETS OLYMPIC FIVE TOMORROW
## Winged '0' Team Given Odds by Sport Followers; Last Team With Edge Was S.C. 
### 
The next barrier in the path of Gene
\ an Gent's Cardinal basketball live will
appear tomorrow night in the form of
the Olympic Club unlimited quintet.
For the second time in three games
tlie Stanford aggregation will go into
the game on the short end of the odds.
\ an Gent's charges surprised basketball
fans by winning from Santa Clara, and
they impressed the big crowd that filled
the new pavilion last Saturday night
with the ease with which they outplayed
the College of Pacific. The Cardinal
quintet is a combination that is liable to
do the unexpected, and for that reason
the fact that the Winged "O" men are
the favorites in the coming contest is
not taken seriously by followers of the
court game.
The Stanford five is developing by
degrees into a smooth-playing court ma
chine, and Van Gent lias been working
hard the last two days to polish off the
rough spots. Every afternoon there is a
short practice game, «nd the remainder
of' the time is taken up with basket
shooting and drilling on various plays.
"Lefty" Rogers is gradually rounding
into form, although his wrenched knee
is not entirely well. It is not probable
that he will get into the game tomorrow
night. Rogers will have to go at top
speed to break into the game as a regu
lar forward, for Nip McHose is going
great guns.
Experience and weight are the main
handicaps the varsity quintet will have
to contend with against the clubmen.
The unlimited aggregation from Post
street is well versed in all "the ins and
outs of basketball. Most of the team '■
were starring on the court when Davies, j
McHose, Janssen. et al, were still going
to high school.
Robbie Don, for instance, who occu-1
pies one of the guard positions, made his j
first appearance on a Cardinal court '
back in 1917, when he played forward
for the Santa Clara quintet. Since that j
time he has played every year, mostly 1
with the Olympic Cub. At present lie j
wears the colors of two teams. When !
he isn't representing the Winged "O,"
he may be found starring on John Con
nelly's Ignatian aggregation.
