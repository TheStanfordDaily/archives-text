# MOVE FOR FIRST MILLION RESULT OF GREAT NEED
## President's Report of 1913 Tells of Financial Stress And Foresees Alumni Help 
### 
"Stanford's endowment campaign is
by no means the result of a hastily
formed decision, although it has come
as a surprise to the great majority of
people," said Comptroller Roth in an
interview today. "It is the only logical
conclusion to a series of events extend
ing as far back as 1913. At this time
the President's report, which showed the
urgent need of increased revenue, ex
pressed confidence that the rapidly in
creasing alumni body would be the fac
tor which would make provision for ex
pansion, as lias been the case in practi
cally every great educational institu
tion."
