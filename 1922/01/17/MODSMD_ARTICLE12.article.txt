# BABE COURT SQUAD IN PRACTICE GAME WITH WEIGHT TEAM
## 
### 
Scrimmage with the 135-pound basket
hall team occupied the attention of
Coach Duffy Seay and his freshman
basket squad .last night. As the squad
is to be cut to a more workable size at
the end of this week, practice games
are being used to give the coach a better
line on the different members of his
squad.
A great deal of attention is being
paid at present to the developing of
passing and to accurate and fast shoot
ing of baskets. The freshmen have
become accustomed to the new pavilion
court and should find less difficulty in
making shots from now on.
The hour for freshman practice has
been changed from afternoon to 7 :.3()
p. ni., in order to give Seay the after
noon for baseball.
Salinas High School will meet the
Babes on the local court at 7:15 Wednes
day evening, as a preliminary to the
Stanford-Olympic Club game.
