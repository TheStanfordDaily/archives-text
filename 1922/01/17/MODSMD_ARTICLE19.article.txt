# PHI DELTA THETA DEFEATS THETA CHI IN COURT BATTLE
## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta and Sigma Chi staged
a basketball battle last night that was
fast and furious, resulting in a 21 to 7
victory for the former. The Phi Delta
1 licta quintet was superior in every de
partment of the game, and only the un
usual amount of fight shown by the
losers prevented a much higher score.
Some of the best passing work of the
intramural season was performed by Phi
Delta Theta. Piggott, Fletcher, and
Wrenn formed a strong passing combina
tion and carried the ball down the court
in varsity style. The winners possessed
plenty of good substitutes whose en
trance into the game did not seem to
lessen the team's effectiveness.
Piggott and Fletcher tossed most of
the baskets. Fletcher, center, played fast
and was accurate in throwing, making
five baskets. Piggott looped two field
goals and made three free throws.
Wrenn, running guard, seemed to be all
over the court at once, charging after the
casaba and recovering it consistently.
O'Hara alternated with Wrenn, and
Driscoll with Piggott. The men of both
the winning and losing fives were in very
good physical condition, and stood up
under the fast pace much better than the
majority of intramural basketball players.
On the Sigma Chi team, Meecken did
the best work at forward position, and
accounted for five of the seven points
scored. Crawford and Macrorie mixed
into the fast play and held down their
opponents' passing game to a consider
able extent. Parker as running guard
was another reason for the Phi Delta
Theta score not being larger. Had the
basket shooting of the Sigma Chi for
wards been better, the result of the con
test would probably have been close.
Encina won its game by forfeit.
