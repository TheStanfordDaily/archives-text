# As Others See Us

"Oli, wad power the giftie gi'e us,
To see oursel's as ithers see us."
To see ourselves as others see us is indeed a gift,
and for that matter, a power, hut whether the power
works as an advantage to its possessor, or to his dis
advantage, has always been a question to some of
Burns' readers. Many are inclined to believe that
the advantage of the power depends upon the extent
to which it is used.
He who always sees himself as his fellow men
.see him is inclined to act and speak as they would.
Whether he believes in a particular project or not,
he is prone to bow to the belief of the majority.
Whether his deed or thought is something for the
better or not, he is often unwilling to champion it in
the face of disbelief and opposition. Those who
possess the gift are not always so influenced. But
the fact that they are subjected to it is enough to
show that the possession of the "power" is a ques
tionable advantage. Many of the greatest thinkers
and inventors have been looked upon as fools by
"others." They were derided and chaffed. They
were eccentrics. They simply "didn't belong." But
even though they may have seen themselves as
others saw them, they refused to be influenced.
Their own consciences and personal convictions were
sufficient for them. Their initiative was not to be
affected.
After all, the man who always wonders what "peo
ple will say" is vain. Vanity could not exist if what
one person thought of another were a matter of no
consequence. Vanity is not always fed by a mirror.
It is not unknown to the mirror of human life, where
possessors of the "giftie" come to satisfy a really
selfish curiosity. As a matter of fact, the human
mirror is an artificial means by which mere physical
vanity is satisfied.
Man's reflection in the mirror of human life is a
valuable check. But it should not be an obstacle. He
who looks at himself in that mirror and is still con
vinced of the validity of his stand, has no further
use for the "giftie." His maxim is always, "Let thy
conscience be thy guide."
