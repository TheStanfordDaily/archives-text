Stanford University's superior scholarship stand
ards are brought prominently to the foreground in
the case of the Stanford Law School when compar
ing the requirements of that department with the
standards for legal education adopted by the Ameri
can Bar Association.
At the last annual meeting of the national associ
ation the standards approved by that body called for
two years of study in a college as an admission re
quirement for a law course, and a course of three
years' duration for the law work. Although this
was declared to be a notable advance in legal edu
cation. comparable with that made by the medical
fraternity some years ago. the requirements of the
Stanford Law School already are in excess of the
standards adopted by the national association.
Stanford is in a class which requires three years
of additional study for a law degree. Only nine law
schools in the United States, or 6 per cent of the
total, are in this class. Only 28 per cent of the law
schools are now complying with the standard re
quirements approved by the national association.
A degree from the Stanford Law School, it is
apparent, is indicative of much.—The Daily Palo
Alto Times.
