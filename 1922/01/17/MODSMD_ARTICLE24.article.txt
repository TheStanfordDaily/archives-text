# Tuesday Lecture Attendance
## 
### 
A valuable institution planned and carried on pri
marily for students of the University is the Tuesday
evening lecture series conducted by the Committee

on Public Exercises. These lectures are enthusiasti
cally and regularly attended by an audience of fac
ulty members and residents of Palo Alto. Hut ab
sence of student interest in these meetings is appar
ent and student attendance has been sadly lacking.
The Tuesday evening lectures are arranged with
a view toward presenting subjects which represent
a wide variety of interests. The Committee on
Public Exercises employs much time and expense
in obtaining interesting speakers and musicians each
week.
Students, however, have failed to realize and ap
preciate the worth of these Tuesday evening lectures,
the chief value of which lies in the opportunity to
gain first-hand information, to learn other points of
view and to come in contact with men who are in
touch with what is going on in the world—a matter
which the student mind is inclined to disregard.
Carelessness and lack of time, which fundamentally
are never an excuse, are the only reasons for the
general student neglect of the weekly lectilres. Each
lasts approximately an hour, which, if the habit is
once formed, will prove to be an hour well spent.
