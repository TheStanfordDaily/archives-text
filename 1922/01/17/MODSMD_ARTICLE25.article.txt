Oh, correspondents! Hearken unto this, our prayer.
Arid are the delightful gardents of laughter; dry is the
well of humor; quenched is the spark of wit; sterile is
the deep, rich soil upon which Cabbages once flourished.
Where there once were many palms there is nary a
date. Where there once were many dates there is not
one co-ed. Where there thrived many co-eds in days of
old there is never so much as one poor pun. Oh, cor
respondents, get off the dime!

Soon there will be some serious consideration of the
proposal to run "World News in Brief" as a subtitle.

Hi # #
The presidential race is done.
Its alibis are history.
Old Ireland has signed the pledge—
Valera's lost his mystery.
Terence must be in heaven now:
Unswelled is Muller's head.
And Prohibition! —not a chance,
Another joke that's dead.
Our Fatty's stock has far reduced;
Quite stale is Babie Ruth.
The co-eds fair —Oh, what a wear
On Engineers uncouth.
Tuition squibs are terrible.
The freshmen make one blue.
So sterile is the Cabbage Patch —
What's a poor guy to do?

Our lone exhibit today in the line of impressionistic
verse:—

No brick-layer ever laid the cubes like that.

Study, study, study, study. . . ! What sort of a senti

Yes, the w.k public is a Goliath but remember that it
was a round brick that knocked him out.

It is with great feeling that we remove the cubes
and sling this a while:

"Gleason recently returned from Washington, where
he was present as an unofficial observer at the arms
conference." —Times.

It seems that there is a rough situation even at
Washington.

Dear Cabbages: You advise people to "Get into things

on the boat inall i'us e little matters but there is a

would like to know the correct method for getting into
that.—DIANE.

Arid are the delightful gardents of laughter; dry is the

the deep, rich soil upon which Cabbages once flourished.

The presidential race is done.
Its alibis are history.
Old Ireland has signed the pledge—
Valera's lost his mystery.
Terence must be in heaven now:
Unswelled is Muller's head.
And Prohibition! —not a chance,
Another joke that's dead.
Our Fatty's stock has far reduced;
Quite stale is Babie Ruth.
The co-eds fair —Oh, what a wear

Tuition squibs are terrible.
