## 
### 
Appreciation of the courtesy extended
the Centre College football squad by
Stanford University was expressed by
J. B. MeGee, student manager at the
Kentucky college, in a letter to Water
Powell, director of major athletics here.
The "praying colonels" paid a flying
visit to the campus en rotue to San
Diego to play the Arizona eleven, and
went through a short workout on the
second varsity turf.
In his letter McGee attributes the de
feat of the Centre team at the hands of
the Texas Aggies to lack of condition.
The letter follows:
Dr. Mr. Powell—l want to take this
means of thanking you both for the foot
ball team and the scliool for the won
derful time you showed us while in Palo
Alto.
We were not only impressed with the
beauty of the university but also with
the warm reception that you gave us and
the fine treatment while there. Our
only regret was that we could not return
there on our way back to Kentucky.
We were given quite a shock in Texas
by our defeat at the hands of the Texas
Aggies; after defeating Arizona so de
cisively and with the knowledge that the
Aggies had a hard time winning from
Arizona by three points, the team let up
in their training without the thought of
losing. This only goes to show that you
must keep in first class shape to be
successful in college football, and that
you must not let your over-confidence
get the best of you.
Wishing you and your teams a very
successful New Year, I am
Very truly yours,
JOHN H. M'GEE,
Student Manager.
