THE GENOA CONFERENCE
The prospects of a successful econ
omic conference- at Genoa in March
are not too bright with Raymond Poin
care at the head of the French Cabi
net. Lloyd George had hoped in issu
ing the invitation to work out a plan
for an all-European commercial, in
dustrial, and financial revival. France
presents an almost insurmountable ob
stacle to the success of any scheme
which might be purposed in demand
ing that the last cent of the indemnity
from Germany be paid and by insist
ing on her right to occupy the Rhine
land until it is paid.
A conference between the new
French Premier and the British Min
ister of Foreign Affairs, Lord Curzon,
took place at Paris yesterday, but it
was merely a preliminary discussion
of the situation. If France remains
obdurate it is to be expected that the
United States will decline the invita
tion to the Genoa Conference and even
that Lloyd George will postpone it
until a more favorable times.
THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
At a meeting of the Far Eastern
Committee the American delegation
made one more demand with a view
to the maintenance of the open door
in China, namely the abolition of the
Spheres of Influence. Through ad
! journment came soon after this pro
posal was made it was -evident that
i it would be accepted with reserva
tion if at all.
The success of the last, or Chinese,
phase of the conference depends on
whether or not Japan and China can
agree on the Shantung question.
Japan, it has been suggested, may only
he holding off in order to get all she
can, such as recognition of her po
sition in Manchuria, intending then to
take the center of the stage and mag
| nanimously relinquish her holdings in
I Shantung. Or she may be procrasti
nating with the hope that she can
"hang on" until the end, for already
the delegates are anxious to leave,
reservations for sailing having been
made and then cancelled.
There is always the possibility to
be kept in mind that China may re
fuse to sink the nine-power treaty un
less there is a "fair settlement" of her
| Far Eastern questions.
