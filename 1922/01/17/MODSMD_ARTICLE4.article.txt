Stanford women can forget self fur
their art. This is being proved by the
actions of the characters in the "Charm
School,' which will lie presented in the
Assembly Hall, Friday evening.
On the heels of the news that one of
the characters had sacrificed her hair
to make the part more realistic, comes
the word that one of the most popular
of the 500 will bury her natural exuber
ance, vitality and charm under the char
acter of a typical old maid secretary in
a girls' boarding school. With hair
skinned back, severe clothes, and the
stiffness of disappointed maiden love
aspirations, her campus admirers will
scarcely recognize the real identity of
Miss Curtis.
However, in the last act, under the in
fluence of male presence, she blossoms out
a little and approaches ever so slightly
her natural self.
Seats for the show went on sale at 1
o'clock in the Administration Building
and at Crandall's in Palo Alto. Although
matiy tickets were sold, there is still a
quantity of good seats available at both
places, according to Masquers' Society.
