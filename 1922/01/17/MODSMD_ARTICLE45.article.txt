# G. T. CLARK, LIBRARIAN, ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN PLANNING NEW BUILDING
## 
### 
Gtoige 1 lioina.s Clark, whd been
head of the Stanford Library since 1907,
took a nactive part in planning the
j present building and in making it the
.model that it is. The new library, which
was opened in the fall of 1919, is con-
I sidered as an especially well lighted
! structure of this kind and unusually
j well arranged and convenient for the
! students, much of which is due to the
' work of Mr. Clark.
I ntil this building was completed the
present Administration Building was
| used for the library. Fur several years
! the 1 rustees had realized its inadequacy
; and in 1913 they decided to go ahead
with tliti erection of the new library,
j Mr. Clark was sent East to look over
the important libraries and tf> get sug
gestions from them. He was not inex
perienced in this line, for when he was
j the head of the San Francisco public
| library in 1904 he made a tour of the
I country to gather ideas for a new build
ing which was to be erected in that
j city. On this tirst trip he visited prac
tically all of the. well equipped libraries
of that time, so that his later tour was
a rounding out of the former inspection
land lie looked over only the buildings
' which had been put up in the mean
while. As a result of these trips, Mr.
! Clark took the good points of the other
j libraries and, adding some original fea
tures, planned the Stanford Library.
During the year 1920, Mr. Clark, dur
| ing a leave of absence from the Univer
; sity, made a journey around the world
on which, as a side issue, he visited fa
| mous libraries and purchased books . He
j went first to Japan where he was en
tertained by the Stanford Club which
is composed for the most part of Japa
nese graduates from Stanford. In Tokio
they gave a banquet for him at a, Japa
nese tea house during which, according
j to Mr. Clark, "they squatted around on
I matting and partook of native dishes for
two or three hours" in true Japanese
fashion.
From Japan he proceeded to the Ma
lay Settlements and India where he had
planned to meet Dr. Brainerd Spooner,
'99, who is the deputy director-general

of the Indian Archeological Survey; but
did not do this owing to the fact that
he did not reach Delhi, the capital, until
April, and the government had already
moved to the summer capital in the
hills at Simla. Mr. Clark, following
! this course of travel, finally came to
Europe.
On tliis trip he purchased over 10,000
volumes for the University Lfbrary.
| Most of them were out of the way books
j which had been ordered for several
I years and which had not been found in j
that time. On account of the low rate j
of exchange between foreign countries |
and America at that time, many of
these volumes were not as costly as they
j would have been under normal coudi
; tions.
Mr. Clark graduated from the Uni
versity of California in 1886 in science,
j He was an editor of the Blue, and Gold
j and in his senior year was the joint j
| editor of the Occident, then one of the 4
leading student publications. Imme
diately after his graduation he took up
library work and was assistant librarian
| at the University of California Library,
! which position he tilled for a year, re
j signing to become deputy state librar
ian at Sacramento. He was at the state
I library from 1887 until 1894. During
.this period he collaborated with another
I member of the library staff and prepared
the first comprehensive index to the laws
of California published up to that date. |
Mr. Clark was then made librarian of !
the San Francisco public library. It was J
! during his years there that the earth- |
quake and fire occurred which left only |
20,000 volumes where the library had
possessed 165,000.
