# SPRING SWIMMING MEETS MAY BE HERE
## 
### 
Invitations have been received by
Coach Ernst Brandsten from the Pacific
Athletic Association to hold several of j
the junior swimming championships of !
the Pacific Coast at the Encina pool dur- \
ing the spring. There is a possibility
that the junior diving title might be I
contested for in the Cardinal pool because |
of the excellent facilities that are of- j
fered. The breast stroke and 100-yard i
event may also take place here.
The holding of these races will bring j
to Stanford many of the best young |
swimmers of the coast and will also
offer a good opportunity for several of
Brandsten's aquatic stars to win titles
for themselves and Stanford. The
events that will be staged here and
their dates will be announced as soon
as final arrangements are carried out.
