# PROFESSOR SANFORD EXPLAINS THINKING
## "Success In Science Study" Is Theme of Address By Professor Fernando Sanford 
### 
There is only one way to study science j
successfully and that is to employ the i
! scientific method of thinking and work
| ing which has been used by all the sci
entists who have discovered the great
j truths of the universe, and which only
j a few men in each generation completely
! master. This is the point which Profes
| sor Fernando Sanford of the Physics
I Department stressed in his lecture on
"The. Study of Physics" at the Little
, Theater last night.
"All peoples have desired to compre
! hend the universe of which they are a
I part." said Professor Sanford. " This
desire is the beginning of scientific
study." The true study of science in
i volves first of all, in his opinion, orig
inal thinking and experimentation. "As
physics ;md other sciences are taught in
the school today, the rules of Xewton.
Galileo and Faraday are set forth for
the students to memorize and the stu
dents are given little or no opportunity
for independent work for forming their
own opinions. Most of the teachers who
introduce experimentation do it for il
lustration or to keep the pupils busy."
j In explaining what constitutes the
J scientific method of study. Professor
Sanford said that the scientists first ex
periments with his problem in order to
understand it better. Then, by inductive
reasoning, he forms an hypothesis to
j the effect that certain other phenomena
I must be true under certain given condi
tions which they have not seen. From
this he formulates a law and the later
tests it by further experiment to prove
its veracity.
"This method was originated in the
seventeenth century by William Gilbert
who may, for the English-speaking
world, be called the father of physical
science. 'I his discovery marked the
turning point of science study and has
proved to be the greatest force in mold
ing the civilization of the modern world.
Up to that time, men had spent their
time trying to find some general princi
ple from which all the phenomena of
the universe could be deduced and in
arguments over their theories. An oc
casional man during that period, such
as Roger Bacon, seemed to have an in
sight into the method of studying science
! but their ideas made no impression upon
! the scholars."
To elucidate further as to what he
meant by "the" method of scientific
! study, Professor San ford took - everal
■ great truths of physics and explained.
I step how they were arrived at.
j "This system of investigation leads to a
habit of thinking which is most benefi
cial in any line of work. It is, perhaps,
most useful in physics because, it is easier
ito apply it there than anywhere else. In
: fields where it cannot be applied to any
great extent, there, are not a large ntun
i her of unchangeable laws.
"The learner in science is likely to se
lect th.e problems which have not yet
'been solved for his investigations in
| stead of beginning with the simpler
ones. The most difficult task is to an- j
| alyze a complex problem into simple
! ones. Roth scientific knowledge and in
i sight are required for this. The begin
I ner must be led by one who knows his
I way about, and the teacher has not ac
, complished his work until lie has given
| his pupils at least the theory of the, sci
i entific method of thinking and working,
j for it is the work of all men of science
|to blaze new trails aiul to open them
for others."

To elucidate further as to what he
meant by "the" method of scientific

■ great truths of physics and explained.
I step how they were arrived at.
j "This system of investigation leads to a
habit of thinking which is most benefi
cial in any line of work. It is, perhaps,
most useful in physics because, it is easier
ito apply it there than anywhere else. In
: fields where it cannot be applied to any
great extent, there, are not a large ntun
i her of unchangeable laws.
"The learner in science is likely to se
lect th.e problems which have not yet
'been solved for his investigations in
| stead of beginning with the simpler
ones. The most difficult task is to an- j
| alyze a complex problem into simple
! ones. Roth scientific knowledge and in
i sight are required for this. The begin
I ner must be led by one who knows his
I way about, and the teacher has not ac
, complished his work until lie has given
| his pupils at least the theory of the, sci
i entific method of thinking and working,
j for it is the work of all men of science
|to blaze new trails aiul to open them
for others."
There is only one way to study science j
successfully and that is to employ the i
! scientific method of thinking and work
| ing which has been used by all the sci
entists who have discovered the great
j truths of the universe, and which only
j a few men in each generation completely
! master. This is the point which Profes
| sor Fernando Sanford of the Physics
I Department stressed in his lecture on
"The. Study of Physics" at the Little
, Theater last night.
"All peoples have desired to compre
! hend the universe of which they are a
I part." said Professor Sanford. " This
desire is the beginning of scientific
study." The true study of science in
i volves first of all, in his opinion, orig
inal thinking and experimentation. "As
physics ;md other sciences are taught in
the school today, the rules of Xewton.
Galileo and Faraday are set forth for
the students to memorize and the stu
dents are given little or no opportunity
for independent work for forming their
own opinions. Most of the teachers who
introduce experimentation do it for il
lustration or to keep the pupils busy."
