# PROFESSOR SANFORD EXPLAINS THINKING
## "Success In Science Study" Is Theme of Address By Professor Fernando Sanford 
### 
There is only one way to study science j
successfully and that is to employ the i
! scientific method of thinking and work
| ing which has been used by all the sci
entists who have discovered the great
j truths of the universe, and which only

! master. This is the point which Profes
| sor Fernando Sanford of the Physics
I Department stressed in his lecture on
"The. Study of Physics" at the Little
, Theater last night.
"All peoples have desired to compre
! hend the universe of which they are a
I part." said Professor Sanford. " This
desire is the beginning of scientific
study." The true study of science in
i volves first of all, in his opinion, orig
inal thinking and experimentation. "As
physics ;md other sciences are taught in
the school today, the rules of Xewton.
Galileo and Faraday are set forth for
the students to memorize and the stu
dents are given little or no opportunity
for independent work for forming their
own opinions. Most of the teachers who
introduce experimentation do it for il
lustration or to keep the pupils busy."
j In explaining what constitutes the
J scientific method of study. Professor
Sanford said that the scientists first ex
periments with his problem in order to
understand it better. Then, by inductive
reasoning, he forms an hypothesis to
j the effect that certain other phenomena
I must be true under certain given condi
tions which they have not seen. From
this he formulates a law and the later
tests it by further experiment to prove
its veracity.
"This method was originated in the
