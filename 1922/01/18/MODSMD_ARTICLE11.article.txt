# FRESHMEN TO PLAY SALINAS TONIGHT; SPUDS ARE HEAVY
## 
### 
I Salinas High School has been selected'
I to face the Babe court team in the. has- j
j ketball pavilion tonight at 7:15. as a
j preliminary to the Stanford-Olympic!
; Club game.
According to all reports, the high
school men have collected a fast and
heavy team that is hoping to defeat the
; Babe squad. They will be the first team
that the freshmen have, faced this year i
that will be equal in size and weight.
Coach Duffy Â§eay will probably start j
Hooper and Alexander as forwards, !
Middle-ton at center, and Wielej and ,
Houck at guards. With the exception i
of Hooper, this is the same team that j
| took the floor against Commerce. Hooper j
j has not been out in uniform for long,
j but he is playing in good form and j
i seems able, to work with the other mem- !
| bers of the team, and to place the ball j
j accurately and speedily. He and Alex-j
! ander should prove a more capable pair I
j of forwards than those that played the
j Commerce High School game.
Houck, at standing guard, is capable j
|of playing a good game, but at times j
1 lie becomes confused and allows plays [
! to proceed unmolested.
Coach Seay drilled the squad la*t night j
iii passing and in one of two simple j
plays for advancing the ball. Failure j
to pass accurately and swiftly was large j
: ly responsible for the defeat of the fresh- '
j men in game with Commerce High|
j School.
Student body cards will admit to both
v? >ntests.
