Can you imagine a starving Stanford

| often the case after many weary hours
i watching a basketball game. To remedy
j this terrible condition a group of the
j live hundred have assumed the great
1 responsibility of feeding such unfor-
I tunates. Will the food be fret.? Xot
quite. But only ten cents a piece.
Ihe World Fellowship Committee of
' the \ . W. C. A. will offer for sale the
; finest hot dogs that ten cents can buy
i any place in the country. This sale will
j start after the basketball game this even
j ing and continue until (everyone's appe
j tite has been appeased.
The proceeds of the sale will be placed
j in the fund that helps pay the salary of

j the Union College for Women in China.
