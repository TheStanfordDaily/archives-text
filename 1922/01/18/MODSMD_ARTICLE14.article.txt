# MOVEMENT STARTED TO REDUCE COSTS OF CAMPUS DICES

As the first step in Skull and Snakes' j
movement for reduction of dance ex- I
penditures, speakers will visit every liv
ing unit on the campus tomorrow noon
and night, and will present all details
of the plan for consideration.
A dance which shall be within reach j
of every student on the campus is the i
aim of Skull and Snakes. Representa- i
tives of the society point out that every \
one is eager to have dances placed upon
a sane level. In order to do this, the
present competitive basis, in which each
organization strives to outdo the other
in expense, must be eliminated. The
program initiated calls for the removal j
of seven adjuncts of the functions as 1
now given, which are said to be need- j
less for enjoyment of the occasion, Ka- i
vors, expensive placc cards, engraved
invitations, and flowers will be cut out j
entirely. Decorations will be reduced to j
the absolute minimum. One-leaf pro- j
grams, to be issued to women only, will
be substituted for the leather booklets
now given, and dinner dances, elaborate \
suppers, and other food expenses will be j
eliminated; punch, candy, cigarettes, etc.. j
may only be served. No reduction in '
the quality of the. music is advocated. ;
although the plan recommends securing j
campus orchestras whenever possible.
The money thus saved, providing the,
present assessments are retained, may i
be used for two purposes, according to
the program optlined. hirst, it may he ■
given t<» the endowment fund; when)
this is completed, the money may be '
turned into a Student Scholarship for |
freshman athletes.
There are only three real reasons why j
dances are given, say Skull and Snakes j
members: to get acquainted, to carry
out a social function, 'and for pure en
joyment. In none of these reasons is
there any element making for compeli- j
tion. The effort to outdo each other is I
simply a bad habit which has grown' upon j
student organizations, and deserves no j
recognition as a Stanford custom. Re- i
ports from the Dean of Men's office give J
$20,000 as the conservative estimate for i
dance expenditures for last year. Of j
this, over half was needless, say repre- |
sentatives of the society. As a proof i
that a successful dance needs no el a ho j
rate expenditures, the pavilion dedication '
is cited, which was declared to be the j
most enjoyable affair of the season.
Competition in itself is not condemned
by the proposed system, but will be j
placed on individual initiative and in- 1
genuity. Unique stunts may be devised i
for every dance, it is pointed out. which
will not add to the expenses.
Several evils besides that of useless j
competition are given as results of the :
present method. Among these is the
often-heard complaint of those who
have flunked out. that they were taken
away from their studies at critical time - |
