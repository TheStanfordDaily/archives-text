"Where have the good-time parties of days past
gone?" is the question asked often by the man who
craves the fun that came with the old-time party,
when the matter of finance was secondary and the
foremost thing to lie reckoned with was the good
time to he had by those present. The old-timers
tell us of the good parties that such and such an or
ganization used to throw in the "days that was."
and how the whole outlay amounted to a per capita
charge of six hits. Those were the days, all right.
fn the last few years, however, there has crept
into the local parties a spirit of ostentation that is
foreign to the principles upon which we base our
cherished democracy. The first thing, perhaps, that
started the tendency toward outside show was the
procuring of city music. This does not necessarily
mean an orchestra from San Francisco, but one
which no other group had had here and one which
would attract the attention of the roughs and dancers '
as something that made a better show for appear
ance's sake than the one that some other group had
had in the past. Next came the craze of outside
decoration. This has not taken hold to any large
extent in the dances of the smaller groups because of
the fact that it is absolutely prohibitive in price. To
hire an outside decorator requires 110 ingenuity, and
after all a little brains spent in tastefully decorating
a house or ballroom for a dance goes much further
at less cost than entrusting the business to an out
sider who brings in his ideas merely for the sake
<tf selling them to the hosts' fancy. Flowers and
favors are still more costly to the individual because
the former are an added burden on the guest or an
unnecessary expense to the entertaining group if it
furnishes them. It still remains an almost unbroken
custom for flowers not to be worn at campus for
mals, but the number of corsages and larger flower
pieces sent before each of the formal dances on the
campus is astonishing when it is supposed to be un
derstood that 110 flowers are to be sent.
this has led, through the competition for finery
that has developed, to a state where some of the
campus groups flatly refuse to give dances, as they
think that they can not compete in the extravagance
with their friends. Some may say this is false pride.
Perhaps; but if things have gotten to the place where
a group feels always called upon to go one step
further in wonderful decoration and expense as to
orchestra than the group which gave the last dance,
there is a limit which will soon be reached by all and
force a reversion to a less expensive type of party.
Skull and Snakes is sponsoring a plan for cutting
down the expenses of the parties that are to be given
in the future. The idea is not new. but is one
that has not been forcibly brought to mind before.
Skull and Snakes is the active pusher for the plan,
and, representing practically every group on the
campus, will make a personal canvass of all living
groups, explaining the advantages to be gained and
the good that the cutting down of the expense ac
count will do to all concerned.
The purposes of the movement is not to foist upon
the organizations a set of rules, for there are already
too many of those in regard to other things. Ihe
aim is to awaken a spontaneous response to the ap
peal which will come from flie interested organiza
tions themselves. The much-sought-after thing is
making the parties the real get-togethers that they
are meant to be, and not the social spectacles run on
;< competitive basi- that so many have come to be in
the past two or three years. The response from
campus groups will decide the success or failure of
the plan.
