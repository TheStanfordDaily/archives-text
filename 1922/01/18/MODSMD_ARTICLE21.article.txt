Cabbages takes this opportunity of publicly condemn
ing the women's honorary organization that includes
in its initiation program the policy of sitting on the
Engineering Bench. Some maiden composed herself
upon the sacred resting place yesterday morning before
the scandalized eyes of four lusty-lunged engineers, who
have since proceeded to expound at length upon the
penomenon. The worst of it all was the fact that the
offender voiced a defiant chortle upon her departure
and left the four worthies struggling with a temptation
to wreak vengeance.
Since the Corner is already a shocking place, the
enraged roughs now seek to connect the bench with
an electric current which they may turn on at will. Can
co-eds stand the joltage of voltage?

TOUCH-BACK OR SAFETY?
In Five Reels
(By I. Manaw Fulham)
Reel I.
Iris in—Footsteps are seen to be heard. SAMSON, a
handsome youth or 25 years, is discovered shaving off
mustache. He throws safety to the winds. First eleven
clipped from behind in initial rush. Play off guard
nets two. Center gets into close scrape, and is penal
ized for holding. Third down, ten.
Enter Delilah, negligee (Props turns on electric fan).
One minute, please, while the operator puts on his
glasses.—Delilah carries a can of beans. Attempts to
wrest razor from Sam's grasp. They wrestle.
# * *
Sub-title—"Down through the ages woman has felt the
desire for a close shave."
* T
Reel 2.
Allegorical—Delilah about to give Samson a college
cut. Highly interpretative dance. Delilah uses spiral
movement, suggestion of barber pole. (Props turns on
spot from rear; very artistic). She lures Samson to
tonsorial couch.
Close-up —showing Samson's combination locks. Com
bination reaper—binder-thresher unlocks Samson. De
lilah, once a barber, poses as genial oil magnate.
* * *
Sub-title—"That will be $1.75." Samson registers
despair. Loses all strength. Staggers out. Allegory
fades.
* # *
Reel 3
Enter David, a child (just too sweet). —David slings
a nuean voice, registering hunger. Samson yeilds, sur
rendering razor to Delilah. David declares flglit a draw.
Kisses both combatants. (Props turns small spot on
I back of David's neck, revealing arable land behind ears).
* * *
Sub-title—"A child shall lead them."
» m
Soft Focus —Sam wistfully contemplates right end of
mustache. Ghost of left end shows, flickers, is gone.
("Hearts and Flowers" on automatic piano.) Samson
heaves a long sigh. But it is incomplete. Cut.
* # #
Sub-titie—"When the purple shadows of dying day
crept thunderously over the smiling land."..

Reel 4
Long Shot —The evening meal is ready, the table is
j set. Samson is on the mark, waiting to go.
Enter Delilah—Bearing twin bowls of transparent
| liquid. Samson, who has taken the free courses in the
Union, is the first to recognize it. Bean soup! Gillette
j will have to be canned.
Close-up—Samson has been used to working under a
j strain. But his left flank is exposed. Giving a wild
I cry, Samson chokes on the unflltered fluid.
# # *
Sub-title—"While life hung in the balance." (Art
background, showing Fate, in sheet, balancing on pie-
I plate).
* * *
Reel 5
Fade-in —Delilah is wringing her hands. They don't
j answer. She begins searching t'6r safety, it cannot be
found. She registers thought.
Sub-title—"A thought!"
Cut-back —Before dinner. Delilah, without regard for
her husband's safety, lets it fall in soup.
Panorama —Tube of John Henry's Shaving Cream;
"Man, it makes your raxor slip like an oyster." Delilah,
in a big heat, seizes tube.
Close-up—Samson struggling violently. Enter Delilah.
She gives him assorted doses of shaving cream. Razor
slips down like an oyster. Slow fade.
Sunset —Sam, with mustache permanently waved, is
silhouetted against sky. Delilah approaches. They meet.
With tender passion, Samson gives Delilah a can-opener.
Fade out.
(Props slowly turns off sun.)

"It sure is an eye-ful," burst out Hugo, the midnight
moth; "The way this guy McHose rolls up the score."

Editorial.
It is with sincere regret that we call to attention a
flagrant over indulgence in Stanford spirit, a gross over
stepping of bounds. We cannot use words too strong to
smell out the culprit and bring him down to justice.
Can there be a greater drop in traditions, a more severe
let-down for the University as a whole?
We refer to the gentleman who, on the momentous
night of the Pavilion dedication, fell off the balcony onto
the spring floor. We feel he should have taken things
more for granted.

Victory!
II was the great moment. 50,000 spectators jumped on
their feet. The World's Championship was at stake.
The American candidate, after live months' practice in
his telephone booth, stepped into the arena. He rent
the air with a reverberant yodel. The sound bounded
and rebounded from top to bottom. Suddenly it hit a
large man on the rear seat, who was filled with the
j milk of human kindness, and turned him into a Swiss
cheese, winning the title for the United States.
