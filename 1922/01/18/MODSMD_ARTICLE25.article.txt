Agreement on China.
A way to remove the Chinese tangle
j from the path of the disarmament con-
I ference has been proposed by Secretary
; Hughes and seems likely to be accepted.
|By this plan "a board of reference,"
made up of representatives of the mosi
I important nations, would pas-, on all
j matters of the "open door" and like
question in regard to China, and would
endeavor to see that the door really
I kept "open" in fact as well as in name.
England, France, Belgium, and Italy
have made preliminary approvals of
this plan, while the Japanese delegates
j accept the "principle" of the thing, but
!do not commit themselves further.
France's Nationalist Program.
Raymond Poincare, new premier of
France, seems to be gradually swinging
toward his side all the support he needs
i from the French parliament to give him
! power to go ahead with his Nationalist
program for France, including a more
strict program toward Germany and as
surances of ample protection in the way
i of armament allowed by the conference.
The British Cabinet meets tomorrow
. ' to discuss some of the most serious prob
! lems that have come before it at some
| time. Lloyd George wants to see what
| British sentiment is about changing cer-
J tain clauses in the Anglo-French treaty
!—alterations that have been asked by
I Poincare. Also, Great Britain wants to
keep France's friendship to the fullest
extent, and is anxious that site should
| participate in the forthcoming Genoa
| economic conference.
U. S. and Russia at Genoa.
I The problem now before the United
States is whether or not to accept the
: invitation to the Genoa conference, an
invitation that would involve the recog
nition. of the Soviet government of Rus
sia, as the Allies have agreed to recog
nize Lenine and help in the rehabilitation
of Russia if the latter will make certain
; pledges. Payment of debts, security for
i ! foreign enterprises, establishment of a
I judicial and legislative system that is
' j adequate, and halting of all propaganda
■ are some of the things that Russia must
' | agree to if she is to receive any help.
I It has always been against the policy of
J! the United States to recognize the Soviet
| government ever since it came into pow
s er by violence several years ago, and
~ the question is, what shall the present
- j policy be?
