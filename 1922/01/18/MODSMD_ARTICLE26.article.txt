# FIRE TOTALLY DESTROYS PALO ALTO LAUNDRY
## 
### 
The explosion of a tank of gasoline
in the rear of the Palo Alto Laundry at
644 Emerson, last night, totally de
stroyed the property, valued at $10,-

of clothes on their backs like so many 1
ants struggling to remove eggs from
an endangered hill. Most of the
bundles removed were of soiled laun

fire was discovered had turned into a
mass of flames, in an attempt to save }
all the clothes in their charge, but

to drop their bundles inside and dash j
for the door. A great deal of the busi
ness was from the campus.
Hard luck seems to have pursued i
the enterprise lately. Only last week
the delivery trrn'k was smashed up in
a collision.lt had just been fixed
when the fire occurred.
Although there was no loss of life,
