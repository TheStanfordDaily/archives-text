# SEAY AND KALLAM TO MAKE CUT IN BASEBALL SQUADS ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
Preliminary cuts in both varsity anil
freshman diamond squads will he made
; the last of this week, according to an
i nouncements made yesterday afternoon
hy Coaches Seay and Kallam. At pres
ent the squads are so unwieldv that it i*
impossible for each man to get tlie. right
I amount of workout during a practice.
Coach Seay, in order to devote him
i self entirely to the new men, has sep
| arated his "letter" men from the re-
I
| emits, and the veterans are putting on
j a whirlwind practice of their own each
| afternoon. This "Old-Guard" workout
consists mainly of bunting, warming-up
j games of catch, long flies to the outer,,
lot for one. or two unfortunate fielders
j to "shag," and tobacco chewing.
The prospective candidates for berths
mi the squad have been going through j
! a series of practices so that Coach Seay j
' may have a chance to look each man i
over as he takes his turn. Ability in
fielding, hitting, bunting, base running, i
and general performance in a uniform, j
will all be taken into account, and Coach
Seay has declared that he wants no
man to be dropped from the squad with
' out feeling that he has had a chance to
! show what he can do.
Johnny Couch gives out the encourag
ing statement that the pitching staff is
: showing up even better than he ex
■ pectcd. It is too early yet for him to
| pick out any of the me nas "best bets,"
| for the next month of training will
I change them completely. Draper, Seay s
mainstay last season, lias the most expe
; rience to his credit, and Nef and Kelly
look good for pre-season form.
Down on the freshman lot, Floyd Kal-
I lam has been putting a rather motley
! crew of yearlings through the tirst rudi
ments of college baseball. Some of his
i men have suits and most of them have
not. With the cut of the varsity squad,
I the suits now used by last year s fresh
! man players will be available to Kal
; lam's men.
Kallam is not really under way yet,
I but he was a good deal more hopeful of
I future prospects yesterday afternoon
i than when he. tirst assembled his crew
I There is a lot of ground work to be
j done before any noticeable headway can
be made. Yesterday tlie Babes learned
j some of the fundamentals of the art of
i bunting. The proper form for fielding
' and hitting will be the next on the. list
! of acquired abilities.
Both squads will practice every Sat
urday afternoon at 2 o'clock and at this
j time on the coming Saturday the first
1 cuts will be made.

I the suits now used by last year s fresh

; lam's men.
Kallam is not really under way yet,
I but he was a good deal more hopeful of
I future prospects yesterday afternoon
i than when he. tirst assembled his crew
I There is a lot of ground work to be
j done before any noticeable headway can
be made. Yesterday tlie Babes learned
j some of the fundamentals of the art of
i bunting. The proper form for fielding
' and hitting will be the next on the. list
! of acquired abilities.
Both squads will practice every Sat
urday afternoon at 2 o'clock and at this
j time on the coming Saturday the first
1 cuts will be made.
Preliminary cuts in both varsity anil
freshman diamond squads will he made
; the last of this week, according to an
i nouncements made yesterday afternoon
hy Coaches Seay and Kallam. At pres
ent the squads are so unwieldv that it i*
impossible for each man to get tlie. right
I amount of workout during a practice.
Coach Seay, in order to devote him
i self entirely to the new men, has sep
| arated his "letter" men from the re-
I
| emits, and the veterans are putting on
j a whirlwind practice of their own each
| afternoon. This "Old-Guard" workout
consists mainly of bunting, warming-up
j games of catch, long flies to the outer,,
lot for one. or two unfortunate fielders
j to "shag," and tobacco chewing.
The prospective candidates for berths
mi the squad have been going through j
! a series of practices so that Coach Seay j
' may have a chance to look each man i
over as he takes his turn. Ability in
fielding, hitting, bunting, base running, i
and general performance in a uniform, j
will all be taken into account, and Coach
Seay has declared that he wants no
man to be dropped from the squad with
' out feeling that he has had a chance to
! show what he can do.
Johnny Couch gives out the encourag
ing statement that the pitching staff is
: showing up even better than he ex
■ pectcd. It is too early yet for him to
| pick out any of the me nas "best bets,"
| for the next month of training will
I change them completely. Draper, Seay s
mainstay last season, lias the most expe
; rience to his credit, and Nef and Kelly
look good for pre-season form.

! crew of yearlings through the tirst rudi
ments of college baseball. Some of his
i men have suits and most of them have
