# VARSITY BASKETERS FACE HARD CONTEST WITH OLYMPIC CLUB
## VAN GENT'S FIVE WILL MEET SPEEDY PLAYERS TONIGHT 
### 
Captain Jimmy Davies and his crew j
of varsity basket shooters will tackle j
|
the Olympic Club unlimited five, to
night, in the ne ,v puvllicn. The gams.
v/1 ich is the li'jx: to the la.st en the
Cardinal preliminary schedule, will bc
frln piomtly at 8 30.
j Competition of an even more i
strenuous sort than that furnis'.ie 1 by
Santa Clara a week ago, is promised
for Van Gent's quintet. A victory over
I the experienced clubmen will materi
j ally strengthen the growing belief that
j Stanford will be among the real con
tenders in the race for the Conference
I championship.
There is a considerable mix-up as to
whom Joe Ryan, commissioner of
basketball at the Olympic Club, will j
i send down tonight. Latest reports in
i dicate that last year's welterweight :
; aggregation, which was a better team
j than the unlimiteds, is now the Olym-!
j pic Club's first team. Ryan may mix
i the two line-ups bv adding Don or!
j Needles to give the welters more j
: weight, but it is more likely that the
same men who lost to Stanford a year
ago by a .39 to 34 score will take the
; floor tonight.
Prom start to finish it will be a j
| battle of speed against, speed. The
lightning Cardinal forwards, Davies |
; and McHose, will bump up against
i guards that are nearer their own j
weight, and who do some fast trav.el- :
ing on their own account.
The Olympians are veterans in the 1
real sense of the word. With one ex-1
[ception they have played together for j
i three years. In that length of time!
they have only met four defeats, one !
of them to the Los Angeles Athletic
Club by a single point in the national j
j championships two years ago. Nevada*
beat them twice and Stanford once.:
i Lauterwasser, Boyle and Gavin made ;
their entrance into "big time" basket
i ball more than half a decade ago.
The Cardinal combination is be- j
ginning to work together, and the!
newcomers—McHose, Janssen and De- 1
Groot —are just acquiring the mutual i
understanding that is essential in the j
rapid action of basketball. Van Gent |
