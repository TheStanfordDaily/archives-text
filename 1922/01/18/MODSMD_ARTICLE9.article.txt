# VARSITY BASKETERS FACE HARD CONTEST WITH OLYMPIC CLUB
## VAN GENT'S FIVE WILL MEET SPEEDY PLAYERS TONIGHT 
### 
Captain Jimmy Davies and his crew j
of varsity basket shooters will tackle j
|
the Olympic Club unlimited five, to
night, in the ne ,v puvllicn. The gams.
v/1 ich is the li'jx: to the la.st en the
Cardinal preliminary schedule, will bc
frln piomtly at 8 30.
j Competition of an even more i
strenuous sort than that furnis'.ie 1 by
Santa Clara a week ago, is promised
for Van Gent's quintet. A victory over
I the experienced clubmen will materi
j ally strengthen the growing belief that
j Stanford will be among the real con
tenders in the race for the Conference
I championship.
There is a considerable mix-up as to
whom Joe Ryan, commissioner of
basketball at the Olympic Club, will j
i send down tonight. Latest reports in
i dicate that last year's welterweight :
; aggregation, which was a better team
j than the unlimiteds, is now the Olym-!
j pic Club's first team. Ryan may mix
i the two line-ups bv adding Don or!
j Needles to give the welters more j
: weight, but it is more likely that the
same men who lost to Stanford a year
ago by a .39 to 34 score will take the
; floor tonight.
Prom start to finish it will be a j
| battle of speed against, speed. The
lightning Cardinal forwards, Davies |
; and McHose, will bump up against
i guards that are nearer their own j
weight, and who do some fast trav.el- :
ing on their own account.
The Olympians are veterans in the 1
real sense of the word. With one ex-1
[ception they have played together for j
i three years. In that length of time!
they have only met four defeats, one !
of them to the Los Angeles Athletic
Club by a single point in the national j
j championships two years ago. Nevada*
beat them twice and Stanford once.:
i Lauterwasser, Boyle and Gavin made ;
their entrance into "big time" basket
i ball more than half a decade ago.
The Cardinal combination is be- j
ginning to work together, and the!
newcomers—McHose, Janssen and De- 1
Groot —are just acquiring the mutual i
understanding that is essential in the j
rapid action of basketball. Van Gent |
has three dangerous men in Davies,
j McHose and Janssen, and if Ryan sets
I his men to watch any of them, the
other two are sure to do lots of dam
age.
The Stanford mentor has worked
wonders with DeGroot, and the big
fellow is appearing to better advant
age in each succeeding game. With
a few more of Van Gent's pointers,
by tlie time the California contest
comes around, he should feel at home
in the standing guard position, and
ought to make a lot of trouble for the
Blue and Gold scoring machine.
Dick Richmond went through the
College of Pacific game without get
ting a single basket and the veteran
guard is due to score some points
against the clubmen tonight. In case
Richmond cannot start, Van Gent will
probably send in Fred Anderson. An
derson's speed and accurate basket-
I shooting will fit in nicely with the
j Davies-McHose-Janssen combination.
I Howell is almost sure to relieve Jans
| sen before the game is over.
! Gavin and Lauterwasser are the
; main attractions on the Olympic five,
j and unless closely guarded, they are
liable to make considerable trouble
for the Cardinals.

age in each succeeding game. With
a few more of Van Gent's pointers,
by tlie time the California contest
comes around, he should feel at home
in the standing guard position, and
ought to make a lot of trouble for the
Blue and Gold scoring machine.
Dick Richmond went through the
College of Pacific game without get
ting a single basket and the veteran
guard is due to score some points
against the clubmen tonight. In case
Richmond cannot start, Van Gent will
probably send in Fred Anderson. An

j Davies-McHose-Janssen combination.

The probable line ups:
Stanford Pos. Olympics
Davies F Gavin
McHose F Lauterwasser
Janssen C Boyle
Richmond G Schweitzer
DeGroot G Belasco
Captain Jimmy Davies and his crew j
of varsity basket shooters will tackle j

the Olympic Club unlimited five, to

Cardinal preliminary schedule, will bc
frln piomtly at 8 30.
j Competition of an even more i
strenuous sort than that furnis'.ie 1 by

for Van Gent's quintet. A victory over

tenders in the race for the Conference
I championship.

i send down tonight. Latest reports in
i dicate that last year's welterweight :

j than the unlimiteds, is now the Olym-!
j pic Club's first team. Ryan may mix
i the two line-ups bv adding Don or!
j Needles to give the welters more j
: weight, but it is more likely that the
same men who lost to Stanford a year
ago by a .39 to 34 score will take the
; floor tonight.
Prom start to finish it will be a j

lightning Cardinal forwards, Davies |
; and McHose, will bump up against
i guards that are nearer their own j
weight, and who do some fast trav.el- :
ing on their own account.
The Olympians are veterans in the 1
real sense of the word. With one ex-1
[ception they have played together for j

Club by a single point in the national j
j championships two years ago. Nevada*
beat them twice and Stanford once.:
i Lauterwasser, Boyle and Gavin made ;
their entrance into "big time" basket

The Cardinal combination is be- j
ginning to work together, and the!

understanding that is essential in the j
