# DICK RICHMOND TO MAKE STAGE DEBUT IN "CHARM SCHOOL"
## 
### 
"I uever hoped before â€¢ray death to
see youth's vision thus made perfect."
Austin Bevans, the handsome youth
with ideas of his own upon education
which he tries to carry out in the
girls' boarding school he has inherit
ed, is the "vision made perfect" to
whom Elsie Benedotti refers in the
"Charm School," which will be pre
sented by Masquers' Society in the
Assembly Hall, tomorrow evening.
Dick Richmond, '21, takes the role
of BevanH in his first appearance as
lead in a campus play. His interpre
tation of the part has caused consider
able comment among the cast and
others who have been present at re
hearsals.
Donaldine Cameron, '23, is said to
be appealing as Elsie, woman's lead.
The delicate modulations of her voice
as she presides over the meeting of
her class-mates and in her pleadings
with Bevans. are expected to win the
admiration of her audience.
Full rehearsals of "The Charm
School" was held last evening and
Coach Gordon Davis will put in the
few finishing touches necessary at the
final rehearsal scheduled for this even
ing.
One of the most entertaining and
picturesque incidents in the play will
come in the second act when the girls
in the school gather around the piano,
sing the popular songs and practice
the latest dance steps. It is a scene
rivalling the chorus numbers in Junior
Operas of the past.
Although practically everyone on
the campus has availed himself of the
opportunity of seeing .one of the
brightest comedies ever offered here,
Masquers' Society has announced that
there are still a few good seats left
at the Administration Building and at
Orandall's in Palo Alto. .
