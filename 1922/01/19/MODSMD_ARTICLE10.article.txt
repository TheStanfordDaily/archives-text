# CARDINALS PROVE FORM BY DEFEATING OLYMPiCS ON PAVILION COURT, 25-21
## 
### (By Garrett Elmore, '23 
Cardinal fighting spirit, team work,
and good coaching—-plus Dick Rich
mond—guided the Stanford varsity
basketball team to a 25-21 victory over
the Olympic Club five, last night.
The more finished aggregation drew
tlie short end of the score, but the bet
ter team won. Van Gent's quintet met
the Winged "O" at their own game,
which was team work and speed, and
went them one better. The Cardinal
five-man defense, practically impene
trable. was the thing that turned the
tide toward Stanford, after the play
had see-sawed back and forth for two
thirds of the fray.
The Cardinal experienced a new sen
sation last night. They had gone into
contest on the short end of the odds,
but never before had they been de
finitely on the short end of the score.
Their reaction was to put on more
speed, wiping out the 8 to 4 lead of
the Olympics, and placing themselves
ahead, 12 to 9.
Richmond Emulates Hero
It was nothing new for Dick Rich
mond, veteran of two championship
teams, to star on the basketball court.
The shot from mid-court which left his
hands as the gun went off in the Wash
ington State game two years ago,
found the basket, and won for Stan
ford the Pacific Coast Championship.
But last night Richmond was two

j heroes. He was probably thinking of
the leading part he was to take in the
i dress rehearsal of "The ('harm School"
1 after the game, when he scored four
I field goals. Richmond was always in
j the right place at the right moment,
and it was he, together with DeGroot,
Jwho stopped the dangerous rushes of
! the Olympic forwards.
Olympic Vets Unvailing
Ryan injected Dick Berndt and
Wally Barnes, stars of past basketball
| contests, into the fray In the hope
that they could pierce the Cardinal de
fense. Berndt put up a good fight, but
the Cardinal five-man defense proved
| too much for the three-man attack of
; the Olympics.
DeGroot was a little unsteady in the
first half, but he came back with a
j vengeance in the final period. Janssen,
: too, didn't get started until the last
half, but the almost impossible plays
performed by the lanky center just
before Howoll relieved him saved more
i than one goal. Howell bolstered up
the Stanford defense, and worked
| nicely with Davies and MeHose, al
though he did not score.
Davies Scores Most of Points
i ITpon the shoulders of Davies and
j Richmond fell the burden of the scor
ing for the Stanford quintet. The
i Cardinal skipper put in four field
goals and converted seven out of ten
free throws. MeHose played a good
game, both on the offense and de
fense, but he failed to break into the
| point column.
Outcome Uncertain in First Half
; The first half contained both bitter
. and sweet for the Cardinal adherents.
It was after only two minutes of hot
playing that Davies broke the spell
with a field goal. Belasco, the Olympic
l guard, slipped in and threw a basket
that tied the score. There was a lull
in the play, and the game took the
> form of a contest in converting fouls,
; with Gavin and Davies as principals.
J With the score Bto4 in the clubmen's
; favor, Stanford tame with a rush,
Davies and Richmond rolling up eight
points. The Olympic rallied and long !
| shots by Boyle. Schweitzer and Lau- i
; terwasser, with a foul by Gavin, put I
I tliem ahead 15 to 12.
; "O" Outplayed in Final Period
Davies and his mates came back
| strong in the second half and quickly
I evened up the score. Not content with j
that, Richmond made a pretty basket
i from right center, and Davies, skillful
ly eluding the charging guard, added
two more points. The teams lined up
and Richmond took the ball from the
jump-off for another score, making
the count 21 to 15. The Winged "O"
i rallied and in two more minutes the
| scoreboard read 23 to 19. Richmond i
made the final Stanford goal. With a
minute to go, Schweitzer tallied for
j the Olympics, but the gun stopped
j the rally short,

five-man defense, practically impene
trable. was the thing that turned the
tide toward Stanford, after the play

The Cardinal experienced a new sen

contest on the short end of the odds,
but never before had they been de
finitely on the short end of the score.
Their reaction was to put on more
speed, wiping out the 8 to 4 lead of
the Olympics, and placing themselves

Richmond Emulates Hero
It was nothing new for Dick Rich
mond, veteran of two championship
teams, to star on the basketball court.
The shot from mid-court which left his
hands as the gun went off in the Wash
ington State game two years ago,
found the basket, and won for Stan
ford the Pacific Coast Championship.
But last night Richmond was two

j heroes. He was probably thinking of
the leading part he was to take in the
i dress rehearsal of "The ('harm School"
1 after the game, when he scored four
I field goals. Richmond was always in
j the right place at the right moment,
and it was he, together with DeGroot,
Jwho stopped the dangerous rushes of
! the Olympic forwards.
Olympic Vets Unvailing
Ryan injected Dick Berndt and
Wally Barnes, stars of past basketball
| contests, into the fray In the hope
that they could pierce the Cardinal de
fense. Berndt put up a good fight, but
the Cardinal five-man defense proved
| too much for the three-man attack of
; the Olympics.
DeGroot was a little unsteady in the
first half, but he came back with a
j vengeance in the final period. Janssen,
: too, didn't get started until the last
half, but the almost impossible plays
performed by the lanky center just
before Howoll relieved him saved more
i than one goal. Howell bolstered up
the Stanford defense, and worked
| nicely with Davies and MeHose, al
though he did not score.
Davies Scores Most of Points
i ITpon the shoulders of Davies and
j Richmond fell the burden of the scor
ing for the Stanford quintet. The
i Cardinal skipper put in four field
goals and converted seven out of ten
free throws. MeHose played a good
game, both on the offense and de
fense, but he failed to break into the
| point column.
Outcome Uncertain in First Half
; The first half contained both bitter
. and sweet for the Cardinal adherents.
It was after only two minutes of hot
playing that Davies broke the spell
with a field goal. Belasco, the Olympic
l guard, slipped in and threw a basket
that tied the score. There was a lull
in the play, and the game took the
> form of a contest in converting fouls,
; with Gavin and Davies as principals.
J With the score Bto4 in the clubmen's
; favor, Stanford tame with a rush,
Davies and Richmond rolling up eight
points. The Olympic rallied and long !
| shots by Boyle. Schweitzer and Lau- i
; terwasser, with a foul by Gavin, put I
I tliem ahead 15 to 12.
; "O" Outplayed in Final Period
Davies and his mates came back
| strong in the second half and quickly
I evened up the score. Not content with j
that, Richmond made a pretty basket
i from right center, and Davies, skillful
ly eluding the charging guard, added
two more points. The teams lined up
and Richmond took the ball from the
jump-off for another score, making
the count 21 to 15. The Winged "O"
i rallied and in two more minutes the

Richmond Emulates Hero
It was nothing new for Dick Rich
mond, veteran of two championship
teams, to star on the basketball court.
The shot from mid-court which left his
hands as the gun went off in the Wash
ington State game two years ago,
found the basket, and won for Stan
ford the Pacific Coast Championship.
But last night Richmond was two

j heroes. He was probably thinking of
the leading part he was to take in the
i dress rehearsal of "The ('harm School"
1 after the game, when he scored four
I field goals. Richmond was always in
j the right place at the right moment,
and it was he, together with DeGroot,
Jwho stopped the dangerous rushes of
! the Olympic forwards.
Olympic Vets Unvailing
Ryan injected Dick Berndt and
Wally Barnes, stars of past basketball
| contests, into the fray In the hope
that they could pierce the Cardinal de
fense. Berndt put up a good fight, but
the Cardinal five-man defense proved
| too much for the three-man attack of
; the Olympics.
DeGroot was a little unsteady in the
first half, but he came back with a
j vengeance in the final period. Janssen,
: too, didn't get started until the last
half, but the almost impossible plays
performed by the lanky center just
before Howoll relieved him saved more
i than one goal. Howell bolstered up
the Stanford defense, and worked
| nicely with Davies and MeHose, al
though he did not score.
Davies Scores Most of Points
i ITpon the shoulders of Davies and
j Richmond fell the burden of the scor
ing for the Stanford quintet. The
i Cardinal skipper put in four field
goals and converted seven out of ten
free throws. MeHose played a good
game, both on the offense and de
fense, but he failed to break into the
| point column.
Outcome Uncertain in First Half
; The first half contained both bitter
. and sweet for the Cardinal adherents.
It was after only two minutes of hot
playing that Davies broke the spell
with a field goal. Belasco, the Olympic
l guard, slipped in and threw a basket
that tied the score. There was a lull
in the play, and the game took the
> form of a contest in converting fouls,
; with Gavin and Davies as principals.
J With the score Bto4 in the clubmen's
; favor, Stanford tame with a rush,
Davies and Richmond rolling up eight
points. The Olympic rallied and long !
| shots by Boyle. Schweitzer and Lau- i
; terwasser, with a foul by Gavin, put I
I tliem ahead 15 to 12.
; "O" Outplayed in Final Period
Davies and his mates came back
| strong in the second half and quickly
I evened up the score. Not content with j
that, Richmond made a pretty basket
i from right center, and Davies, skillful
ly eluding the charging guard, added
two more points. The teams lined up
and Richmond took the ball from the
jump-off for another score, making
the count 21 to 15. The Winged "O"
i rallied and in two more minutes the
| scoreboard read 23 to 19. Richmond i
made the final Stanford goal. With a
minute to go, Schweitzer tallied for
j the Olympics, but the gun stopped
j the rally short,

Cardinal fighting spirit, team work,
and good coaching—-plus Dick Rich
mond—guided the Stanford varsity
basketball team to a 25-21 victory over
the Olympic Club five, last night.
The more finished aggregation drew
tlie short end of the score, but the bet
ter team won. Van Gent's quintet met
the Winged "O" at their own game,
which was team work and speed, and
went them one better. The Cardinal
five-man defense, practically impene
trable. was the thing that turned the
tide toward Stanford, after the play
had see-sawed back and forth for two
thirds of the fray.
The Cardinal experienced a new sen
sation last night. They had gone into
contest on the short end of the odds,
but never before had they been de
finitely on the short end of the score.
Their reaction was to put on more
speed, wiping out the 8 to 4 lead of
the Olympics, and placing themselves
ahead, 12 to 9.
