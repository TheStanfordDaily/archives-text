# BABE FIVE DEFEATS SALINAS HIGH, 35-10
## 
### 
Salinas High School went down to
a 35-10 defeat before the Stanford
j freshmen court team in the basketball 1
j pavilion last night.
Contrary to the general expectations, j
the high school aggregation was light,
| and, except on the defense, weak. On I
j the other hand the freshman squad!
played a much better game than was ex- I
pected, and both in passing and in team-1
work showed great improvement in the
last four days.
Coach Duffy Seay tried out his most
I effective combinations, intending to cut j
the squad at the e.nd of this week. Al- !
exander and Christentsen started tI.V j
game at forward; Thedc and Sliipke i
started at guard, and Logan at center.
Alexander was, as usual, the star of
the game, running a total of fifteen !
points and playing the entire game. 1
I larry Sliipke played at running guard
last night for the lirst time and showed
himself better capable of handling this
position than forward. Sliipke. pos
| esses enough light to keep him always
after the ball, and with a little training
|at this new position, he should be a
valuable man.
Logan, during the short time that he
played center, showed more ability in
getting the jump than Middleton.
At the start of the second half Coach
j Seay used a new combination. Alexan
der remained at forward with Driscolb
Jas his running mate. Houck and
Hooper took the. standing and running
guard positions, with Middleton at
I center. Of this new combination, Hoop
er was the outsanding player. Ile has
| not been in uniform for more than four
| or five days.
Salinas made only two field goals,
both of them by Muller. Most of the I
' efforts of the prep men were devoted to j
keeping the P>abe score as low as pos- j
. siblc.
