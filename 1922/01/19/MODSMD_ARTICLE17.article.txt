### 
"Skull and Snakes plans to substitute
J originality for expense in campus
j dances," said C. J. Tauzer, president of
| the society, in an interview today.
I "Dances should be made distinctively
\ University affairs, not imitations of
; hotel balls. The novelties which distinguish
'tinguish campus functions will, by this
program, be increased, with the cutting
j out of competition in expenditure; the
; ingenuity of each organization will be
â–  come the only basis of rivalry.
The proposed measures were formu
lated by Skull and Snakes. Tauzer ex
plained, to avert the tendency of exor
bitantly priced dances to bccome so
I deeply rooted in the life of the Univer
| sity as to be accepted as a custom.
The plan has been endorsed by stn
j dent representatives as follows:
i "The principle underlying the cutting
j down of unnecessary expenses in giving
! dances is one which is deserving of the
i utmost consideration and support.
"HRATON L. WRFNN.

Conference."
"This campaign to mould campus sen
timent against squandering monex oil >
1 dances i> a mighty good thing. Compe- '
! tition has forced the standard too high !
! and something must he done. Less time !
and money could he spent and still we
would get as much pleasure from the
! dances.
"SEYMOUR TURNER.
"President Circle S. Society."

leads to continually increasing expens

present movement, it can be done with
