# W. A. A. WILL GIVE PAGEANT MONEY TO ENDOWMENT FUND
## 
### 
Proceeds from tlv pageant to he
Riven Alumni Day under the auspices of
the Women's Athletic Association will he
turned over to the "First Million for
Stanford" endowment campaign. This
motion carried at a meeting of the W. A.
A. held last night in the Women's Club
house, along with a sentiment favoring
the presentation of a similar fete by the
Association every spring until the three
million quota of the campaign is reached.
The decision was made with the idea that
it is the duty of the members of the or
ganization to act as a whole, and lend
every effort in helping to put across a
movement that will be of such significant
aid in the development of the University.
In hopes that more players will turn
out for the spring tournaments, a revi
sion was made in the eligibility require
ment that only those who enter the ad
vanced tennis classes Mondays, Tues
days, and Thursdays, can play in the in
tercollegiate tournaments. The require
ment is revised to read: "All women
wishing to enter the intercollegiate
tournaments must practice three times a
week for two weeks or twice a week for
three weeks before the tournaments."
In preparing data for conferring ath
letic points it is necessary for every
woman to sign, if she lias not already
done so, slips distributed to the different
living groups, and post on the gymna
sium bulletin board the list of teams and
games she lias entered since her first
registration in the University. Friday
is the last day these notices can be made.
