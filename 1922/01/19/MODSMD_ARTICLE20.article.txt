# Upper class Laxity
## 
### 
Figures <lo not lie although they are often dis
torted out of all reasonable proportion. A set Of
figures compiled by one who is interested in the sub
ject reveals some peculiar things about the "hello
habit." Complaints are heard from time to time that
the custom of greeting fellow students on the campus
is falling into disuse. Ordinarily that is the motif
for an editorial in which underclassmen are reminded
that .it is a worth-while tradition that the}' should
observe. The "get-on-the-boat" tocsin is sounded
in the ears of the already overinstructed underclass
men, and he is told that the perpetuation of a cus
tom that is highly cherished here is entirely in his
hands. In how many cases is the blame for the non
observance of this tradition rightly placed?
Jt has been found by this interested student that
the upperclassmen are more lax about greetings than
the underclassmen. He spoke first to the older men
because he was a sophomore. In three days he spoke
to 198 and lie received 105 replies. Only 53 per
cent of the men to whom he spoke returned his greet
ing.
Ile encountered IS'' of bis own classmates. Some
times he spoke first and sometimes he waited for
them to speak. ()f the second year men he met 135
spoke, or approximately 65 per cent.
In passing freshmen he waited for them to take the
initiative. They did almost without exception. ( hit
of 20-1 freshmen he passed during the three days of
his experiment 1 () 2, or "4 per cent of them spoke.
The "hello habit" marks Stanford more than anv
other thing we do here as an institution that is demo
cratic. The obvious effects of such greeting upon
both parties in an encounter' have been retold time
and time again.
These figures show that men who have been here
long enough to become upperclassmen, men who
have learned to love Stanford and the practices in
vogue that typify Stanford and make it unique, are
the men who neglect to say "hello" to their fellows.
Saying "hello" is possibly the cheapest thing that
Stanford can do in point of energy expended.
On the other hand, men who are still in their first
year are almost unanimous in the practice of this
small courtesy. The older men know why the hello
habit is so cherished by Stanford men and women,
but the entering student is willing to adopt the prac
tice because he has been told that it is the thing to do.
This attitude on the part of the freshmen is but
one more indication of their willingness to abide by
the rules which govern our lives in Stanford and

tlie smaller rules which govern the relation of the
newcomer to Stanford.

observance of this tradition rightly placed?
Jt has been found by this interested student that
the upperclassmen are more lax about greetings than
the underclassmen. He spoke first to the older men
because he was a sophomore. In three days he spoke
to 198 and lie received 105 replies. Only 53 per
cent of the men to whom he spoke returned his greet
ing.
Ile encountered IS'' of bis own classmates. Some
times he spoke first and sometimes he waited for
them to speak. ()f the second year men he met 135
spoke, or approximately 65 per cent.
In passing freshmen he waited for them to take the
initiative. They did almost without exception. ( hit
of 20-1 freshmen he passed during the three days of
his experiment 1 () 2, or "4 per cent of them spoke.
The "hello habit" marks Stanford more than anv
other thing we do here as an institution that is demo
cratic. The obvious effects of such greeting upon
both parties in an encounter' have been retold time
and time again.
These figures show that men who have been here
long enough to become upperclassmen, men who
have learned to love Stanford and the practices in
vogue that typify Stanford and make it unique, are
the men who neglect to say "hello" to their fellows.
Saying "hello" is possibly the cheapest thing that
Stanford can do in point of energy expended.
On the other hand, men who are still in their first
year are almost unanimous in the practice of this
small courtesy. The older men know why the hello
habit is so cherished by Stanford men and women,
but the entering student is willing to adopt the prac
tice because he has been told that it is the thing to do.
This attitude on the part of the freshmen is but
one more indication of their willingness to abide by
the rules which govern our lives in Stanford and

tlie smaller rules which govern the relation of the
newcomer to Stanford.
Figures <lo not lie although they are often dis
torted out of all reasonable proportion. A set Of
figures compiled by one who is interested in the sub
ject reveals some peculiar things about the "hello
habit." Complaints are heard from time to time that
the custom of greeting fellow students on the campus
is falling into disuse. Ordinarily that is the motif
for an editorial in which underclassmen are reminded
that .it is a worth-while tradition that the}' should
observe. The "get-on-the-boat" tocsin is sounded
in the ears of the already overinstructed underclass
men, and he is told that the perpetuation of a cus
tom that is highly cherished here is entirely in his
hands. In how many cases is the blame for the non
observance of this tradition rightly placed?
