What conclusions are to be reached from the
results of the pledging of new men by the Inter
ernity Conference, representing nineteen of the
nty-three fraternities of Stanford, announced
terday? Twenty-one bids were mailed to the
lawyers and but eight of these were accepted.
The action by thirteen men who were bid in re
fusing to consider the bids at the end of the short
ened period may indicate several things. Some of
these men probably decided not to affiliate with any
fraternity. Others probably were undecided after
ten days of rushing which group they wished to af
filiate with. In either case the incoming men re
fused to be hurried in making their decisions as is
indicated in the fact that but one more than one
third of the bids extended were accepted.
It is plain that the shortened rushing period with
its card system for dates and other rules will not till
the bill. There is a strong argument in this case for
the method which the fraternities will ultimately
rdopt of not rushing until after two quarters of the
first year and of pledging at the end of the third
quarter after an informal period has been passed
through.
