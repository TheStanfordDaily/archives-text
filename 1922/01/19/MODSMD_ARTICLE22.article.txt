o
A PERSON AT THE BASKETBALL GAME
last night remarked that it was funny how the spon
taneous shouting increased when Stanford went into
the lead at the beginning of the second half. Be
fore that most of the noise in the pavilion was made
by the players in action. There is nothing particu
larly funny in that, rather it is sad. All the world
loves a wnner but it takes a mighty good sportsman
to keep rooting when his team is fighting for the lead.
Stanford students have something to shout for every
minute of every basketball game and they should cul
tivate the habit.
