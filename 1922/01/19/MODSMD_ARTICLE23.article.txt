Dead Head of Cabbages:—i agree with your pronunci
ameuto, inserted in Phil's colyum yesterday, that Cab
bages disapproves ot' co-eds on the senior bench, except
for one reservation: that if gents in this institution ever
go around in golf suits the women should be given their
full quota of seats on aforementioned bench.
* * *
If gents ever get that far, senior bench women might
expect, as the next step, for them to wear "knickers"
with silk hosiery.
** * #
Don't agree with Prof. LeClerg. California, along with
other western colleges, is building up a reputation in
the East for more than athletics and when she gets to
think she's something we don't want to see her western
hombres turn Johnny Bandolines any more than ours.
* *
And we don't want any silly $96 asses running around
this campus saying there are only three places in Amer
ica where a gentleman can condescend to send his son,
"Hawhvawd, Princetawn and Stawnfawd."
* H: *
Golf togs instead of cords would be a shadow cast be
fore and if necessary I'd like our old friend, General
Moral Suasion, who has rendered such yeomon service
for sophomores in bygone years, to take a hand.
lis V *
General M. Suasion, as you know, hits hard and makes
his downs.
* * *
After which they set 'em up in the other alley.

Curious enough, all that has nothing to do with what
was promised for this week's Thursday colyum, "The
Rough of '42."

Many a rough surmises it is only the force of social
convention, so largely molded by women, that induces
men to shave; that in a womanless world they wouldn't.
Well, with the increasing campus ratio it's getting to he
a womanless world for most of us. Suppose the roughs
should start a new tradition and shave only when they
have a date to queen. We might anticipate a few re
sults. What follows consists of extracts from the D.P.A.
of 11(42.

With the increase during the year of the Campus
Ratio from 54.3 to 5, to 55.1 to 5, beard-cutting for the
year is slightly below to date last year, and beards are
.38 inch per man longer than normal to date, according
to statistics released today by the Physical Education
Department.
* * *
One of the prettiest weddings in years took place in
the Memorial Church, yesterday afternoon, when Anna
Conda, '43, was wedded to N. Gin Neer, '42. Eight of
the bride's sorority sisters acted as beard-girls and
carried the long brush, 9 feet, 8 3-lfi inches in length,
of which the happy groom so recently shorn himself.
It was the biggest catch in years, surpassing the record
of Roble Queen, '37, who captured on 1 7-1G inches
shorter.
* m *
S. N. Ache, '42, drowned himself in Lagunita pasture
late yesterday afternoon, in grief over a severe attack
of barber's itch, which prevented him from shaving for
over three weeks. Ache, who always shaved twice a
day and whose face had one of the highest polishes in
peninsula society, brooded over the loss of his caste un
til, it is believed, he lost his mind.
« « *
M. E. and G. & M. Societies last night voted heavily
against clean beards. Complain had been made by uni
versity authorities that the many long beards trailing
in the dirt, six to nine feet long, were unsanitary and
objectionable. "A true rough today would no more think
of sending his beard to the cleaners than a rough of the
old days would his cords," declared I. Samson, presi
dent of G. & M.
Intramural sorority league standings released today
show the Gretas leading in number of beards this year
but the Phi Pi house has the greatest total by feet.
Iva Babie Stare, '44, O Alpha, with her junior opera lead,
gives her sorority the biggest gain in the last month.
In individual standings she is topped only by Stickina
Wilson, '43, Dri Telt.
* * *
Wow! 25-21. the same score as the last Cal game!
As the balcony rumbled above me methought I heard
tlio growl of the Bruin Gold. Don't say garrison finish
any more, it's trite, say Stanford finish.

the Memorial Church, yesterday afternoon, when Anna
Conda, '43, was wedded to N. Gin Neer, '42. Eight of
the bride's sorority sisters acted as beard-girls and
carried the long brush, 9 feet, 8 3-lfi inches in length,
of which the happy groom so recently shorn himself.
It was the biggest catch in years, surpassing the record
of Roble Queen, '37, who captured on 1 7-1G inches
shorter.
* m *
S. N. Ache, '42, drowned himself in Lagunita pasture
late yesterday afternoon, in grief over a severe attack
of barber's itch, which prevented him from shaving for
over three weeks. Ache, who always shaved twice a
day and whose face had one of the highest polishes in
peninsula society, brooded over the loss of his caste un
til, it is believed, he lost his mind.
« « *
M. E. and G. & M. Societies last night voted heavily
against clean beards. Complain had been made by uni
versity authorities that the many long beards trailing
in the dirt, six to nine feet long, were unsanitary and
objectionable. "A true rough today would no more think
of sending his beard to the cleaners than a rough of the
old days would his cords," declared I. Samson, presi
dent of G. & M.
Intramural sorority league standings released today
show the Gretas leading in number of beards this year
but the Phi Pi house has the greatest total by feet.
Iva Babie Stare, '44, O Alpha, with her junior opera lead,
gives her sorority the biggest gain in the last month.
In individual standings she is topped only by Stickina
Wilson, '43, Dri Telt.
* * *
Wow! 25-21. the same score as the last Cal game!
As the balcony rumbled above me methought I heard
tlio growl of the Bruin Gold. Don't say garrison finish
any more, it's trite, say Stanford finish.

Dead Head of Cabbages:—i agree with your pronunci

bages disapproves ot' co-eds on the senior bench, except
for one reservation: that if gents in this institution ever
go around in golf suits the women should be given their
full quota of seats on aforementioned bench.

If gents ever get that far, senior bench women might
expect, as the next step, for them to wear "knickers"

Don't agree with Prof. LeClerg. California, along with

the East for more than athletics and when she gets to

Many a rough surmises it is only the force of social
convention, so largely molded by women, that induces
men to shave; that in a womanless world they wouldn't.
Well, with the increasing campus ratio it's getting to he
a womanless world for most of us. Suppose the roughs
should start a new tradition and shave only when they
have a date to queen. We might anticipate a few re

with silk hosiery.

Don't agree with Prof. LeClerg. California, along with
other western colleges, is building up a reputation in
the East for more than athletics and when she gets to
think she's something we don't want to see her western
hombres turn Johnny Bandolines any more than ours.

And we don't want any silly $96 asses running around
this campus saying there are only three places in Amer
ica where a gentleman can condescend to send his son,
"Hawhvawd, Princetawn and Stawnfawd."

Golf togs instead of cords would be a shadow cast be

Moral Suasion, who has rendered such yeomon service
for sophomores in bygone years, to take a hand.

Curious enough, all that has nothing to do with what
was promised for this week's Thursday colyum, "The
Rough of '42."

Many a rough surmises it is only the force of social
convention, so largely molded by women, that induces
men to shave; that in a womanless world they wouldn't.
Well, with the increasing campus ratio it's getting to he
a womanless world for most of us. Suppose the roughs
should start a new tradition and shave only when they
have a date to queen. We might anticipate a few re
sults. What follows consists of extracts from the D.P.A.
of 11(42.

With the increase during the year of the Campus
Ratio from 54.3 to 5, to 55.1 to 5, beard-cutting for the
year is slightly below to date last year, and beards are
.38 inch per man longer than normal to date, according
to statistics released today by the Physical Education
Department.

One of the prettiest weddings in years took place in
the Memorial Church, yesterday afternoon, when Anna
Conda, '43, was wedded to N. Gin Neer, '42. Eight of
the bride's sorority sisters acted as beard-girls and
carried the long brush, 9 feet, 8 3-lfi inches in length,
of which the happy groom so recently shorn himself.
It was the biggest catch in years, surpassing the record
of Roble Queen, '37, who captured on 1 7-1G inches
shorter.

S. N. Ache, '42, drowned himself in Lagunita pasture
late yesterday afternoon, in grief over a severe attack
of barber's itch, which prevented him from shaving for
over three weeks. Ache, who always shaved twice a
day and whose face had one of the highest polishes in
peninsula society, brooded over the loss of his caste un
til, it is believed, he lost his mind.

M. E. and G. & M. Societies last night voted heavily
against clean beards. Complain had been made by uni
versity authorities that the many long beards trailing
in the dirt, six to nine feet long, were unsanitary and
objectionable. "A true rough today would no more think
of sending his beard to the cleaners than a rough of the
old days would his cords," declared I. Samson, presi
dent of G. & M.
Intramural sorority league standings released today
show the Gretas leading in number of beards this year
but the Phi Pi house has the greatest total by feet.
Iva Babie Stare, '44, O Alpha, with her junior opera lead,
gives her sorority the biggest gain in the last month.
In individual standings she is topped only by Stickina
Wilson, '43, Dri Telt.

Wow! 25-21. the same score as the last Cal game!
As the balcony rumbled above me methought I heard
tlio growl of the Bruin Gold. Don't say garrison finish
any more, it's trite, say Stanford finish.
