Hughes' "Open Door" Policy
Sanctioned
The eight states represented at the
Washington Conference have agreed
unanimously (o the first three sections !
of the Hughes proposals with regard
to the "Open Door" in China. The
fourth section provided that "any ex
isting concessions, which appear in
consistent with those of another con
i cession or with the principal of the !
above agreement, may be submitted,
by the parties concerned, to the board
of reference, for the purpose of en- !
deavoring to arrive at a satisfactory ;
j adjustment on equitable terms." This
was defeated by the combined opposi
tion of Japan and France. They fear- !
ed that many of the privileges which j
they had extorted from China in the 1
past might be taken from them by the i
1 "board of reference." Japan is par- [
ticularly solicitous about her famous |
"twenty-one demands" to which China
acceeded during the war. The repre
! sentatives of the United States say :
that the fourth section is unimport- ;
ant and is in general covered by the
third. It is their belief that post con
cessions can si ill. be brought before
the board. However, they appear t<
be alone in this belief China agreed
to the proposals as a step in the right |
direction and with the hope that some
thing better will be gained in the
future.
Poincare to Receive
Confidence 'Vote
It is expected that Premier Poincare i
! will receive a vote of confidence with j
little dissent when he outlines his i
policy before the Chamber of Deputies j
today. Apparently only the extreme
i left will oppose him and he will face j
but seven interpolations. He has ex- j
pressed his "desire to cooperate in the '
work of peace being carried on by the ;
Washington Conference."

Genoa Conference
The American bankers have advised j
that the United States accept the in
i vitation to send representatives to the
Genoa Conference. They argue that
since this country is the most prosper
! ous part of the world we should help j
in any great movement for the eco- j
; nomic reconstruction of the world.
The Genoa Conference will com
mence on March 8, and it is believed
that the Washington Conference will
have come to an end before that
time.
Leon Trotsky prophesies that, un
less the United States is represented,
the conference will be a failure.

was defeated by the combined opposi
tion of Japan and France. They fear- !
ed that many of the privileges which j
they had extorted from China in the 1
past might be taken from them by the i
1 "board of reference." Japan is par- [
ticularly solicitous about her famous |
"twenty-one demands" to which China
acceeded during the war. The repre
! sentatives of the United States say :
that the fourth section is unimport- ;
ant and is in general covered by the
third. It is their belief that post con
cessions can si ill. be brought before
the board. However, they appear t<
be alone in this belief China agreed
to the proposals as a step in the right |
direction and with the hope that some
thing better will be gained in the
future.
Poincare to Receive
Confidence 'Vote
It is expected that Premier Poincare i
! will receive a vote of confidence with j
little dissent when he outlines his i
policy before the Chamber of Deputies j
today. Apparently only the extreme
i left will oppose him and he will face j
but seven interpolations. He has ex- j
pressed his "desire to cooperate in the '
work of peace being carried on by the ;
Washington Conference."
Wall Street Favors
Genoa Conference
The American bankers have advised j
that the United States accept the in
i vitation to send representatives to the
Genoa Conference. They argue that
since this country is the most prosper
! ous part of the world we should help j
in any great movement for the eco- j
; nomic reconstruction of the world.
The Genoa Conference will com
mence on March 8, and it is believed
that the Washington Conference will
have come to an end before that
time.
Leon Trotsky prophesies that, un
less the United States is represented,
the conference will be a failure.
