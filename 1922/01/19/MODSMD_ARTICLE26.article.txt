# PROFESSOR BOEZINGER RELATES CONDITIONS AS ENCOUNTERED IN EUROPE
## 
### 
Bruno Boezinger, Associate Profes
fessor in the German Department lias
returned from a six month's trip to
, Europe, during which he visited his
| native land and spent many weeks
studying conditions there and all over
i Europe.
Professor Boezinger was born in
i Solothurn, Switzerland. He grew up
: and received his early education there,
graduating from the public school.
Leaving Solothurn, he went .to the
School of Theology at Frankfort on
the Main. Later he continued his edu
! cation at the University of Berlin.
He came to the United States thirty
live years ago, going first to New
Orleans, Professor Boezinger went to
Fort Worth College, taking his A.B.
degree there. After he had obtained
his degree, he taught at North Texas
Normal and the University of Texas.
He came to Stanford in 1906, acting
as instructor in German and attend
i ing classes at the same time. He re
ceived his Ph. D, here in 1910, and
has since been Associate Professor in
the German Department.
June 18th of last year. Professor
Boezinger set sail for Europe, going
first to Switzerland. In Switzerland
he found industrial conditions in a
very bad condition. The exchange
j value of money is so low there at the
) present time, that other countries
i whose money is at a lower exchange
j value have been able to compete suc
| cessfully with the Swiss in those lines
in which the Swiss have always been
j supreme. Watches, silks, embroideri
j es, and dyes no longer yield the pro
fits to Swiss manufacturers that they

• j used to, because other countries such
; as Germany and Austria where money
i and labor are cheaper are able to
i j under-sell them. The average skilled
laborer in Switzerland gets from $1.60
■ to $2.40 a day while in Germany the
average wage is but from forty to
eighty cents a day. Professor Boe
i zinger found political conditions nor
, rnal in Switzerland. He spent three
. months there.
In Germany, where he spent three
weeks. Professor Boezinger found in
dustrial conditions better but political
conditions much worse than in Swit
zerland. The conditions of laborers is
comparatively good. The peasants do
not suffer particularly from the high
cost of living. The middle classes,
however, where the vaerage income
before the war was from $5,000 to $10,-
; 000 a year are suffering most. They
would be able to exist at the present
j on these amounts, but their incomes
! have been materially cut down until
now they are suffering greatly from
' the lack of food. The German mark
which formerly had a value of 24 cents
!is now worth about one-lialf of one
I cent. The low value of money is il
lustrated by the fact that an Amer
ican, with American money can obtain
a good meal for fifteen cents. Al
though political conditions are com
paratively quiet, there is a certain
element of unrest. Professor Boe
zinger found that the people as a whole
are satisfied with the new form of
government. There is no thought of
| returning to the monarchy—no long
ing for the old days under the heel
of the emperor. Only the nobles who
i thronged the court of William are
i actually in favor of bringing back the
emperor. However, the peasants of
! Southern Germany and Bavaria do not
esteem the head of the new govern
ment. They consider him an upstart
I and would prefer a ruler from a noble
; family.
"In spite of the heavy indemnities
and the uncertainly of their govern
| ment which hangs over them like a
j cloud, the people go about their work
I cheerfully in an effort to bring things
I back to normal conditions," sand Pro
j
! fessor Boezinger. "The most encour
j aging thing, however, about the situa
| tion in Germany is that the coming
generation is devoting itself, not to
perfection in military lines as before,
but to athletics."
In France. Professor Boezinger
found less unemployment and better
conditions among the working classes
than in the other countries. The large
cities of France are lighted in a pre
war manner at nights while in Ger
many, the cities are practically dark
at nights owing to the shortage of
I coal. t
Speaking of Stanford. Professor
i Boezinger said, "Life here at Stanford
I tends toward a healthy development of
manhood and womanhood. As a for
j eigner, I consider those who are pri
| vileged to come here extremely fortun
la,e'"I a,e '"
