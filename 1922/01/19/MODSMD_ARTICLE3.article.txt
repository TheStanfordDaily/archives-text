# GLEE CLUB PLANS TO TAKE SEVERAL TRIPS
## 
### 
Plans are under way for a tour
through the San Joaquin Valley, dur
ing easter vacation, by the Stanford
Glee Club, as well as for several
shorter week-end trips.
As last year, advance arrangements
are being made by alumni secretary
J. E. .McDowell, who with Director
Allen will accompany the Glee Club
on all trips. In towns where there are
Stanford Clubs it is planned to give
the concerts under their auspices, and
where there are none, under the aus
pices of some local organization.
The only dates that have been de
rided on definitely thus far are Satur
day, Marth 4th, at Stanford, which
â€¢will be the first concert, and Tuesday,
March 7th, in the Scottish Rite Audi
torium in San Francisco, but besides
tht' tour south at the end of March
there will also be week-end trips to
cities in the north, and down the
coast.
