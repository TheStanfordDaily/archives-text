# NEED OF EXPANSION IN FUNDS URGED BY PRESIDENT WILBUR
## 
### 
"
President Wilbur traced the develop- j
mc.nt of Stanford from a financial stand-
I point and described the program of nec
essary expansion, tirst for the present
student body, and second, to allow for
! normal and healthy increase, in a nieel-
I ing of the faculty Tuesday afternoon.
J He told of the original method ot car
i ing for the Stanford trust which was,
j during the life of the donors, very
j largely a personal fund personally ad
i ministered. This traditional policy was
j continued for a number of years; in
j fact, there lias always been in connec
tion with the administration of the Stan
j ford Foundation great deference paid
, to the wishes of the donors.
"Not to grow is to die," said the Pres
| idem. "We can find a gradually nar
' rowing field or we can get the public
and alumni support and ke.ep fully
abreast with the best." In pointing out
! that the University has reached a crisis;
in its development, he said Stanford
finds itself handicapped by an income
which is definitely limited at a level far
| below that of many other institutions.
A large part of the unproductive ranches
formerly a part of the estate have been
sold under very fortunate conditions.
President Wilbur said. Despite this
fact, the rise of general costs has most
seriously handicapped the University.
Among the specific needs which were
outlined by the President was the neces
sity of adding to the salary roll so as to
increase the salaries of instructors to a
level where the best men may be ob
tained and retained as they develop in
the service of the University. At best
this plan will only permit the moderate
scale of living appropriate to academic,
! conditions. When the value of the dol
| lar was cut in half, he continued, many
i promising teachers and instructors were
j forced to go into other professions.
"The First Million for Stanford" will
be devoted to safeguarding the neces
sity of at least a moderately compen
sated teaching staff. We must think in
terms of centuries, said President Wil
1 bur, during which this million is doing
its work of providing improved faculty
i conditions and the best faculty ability
I that is obtainable.
The method by which the $3,000,000
t program will be pressed forward was
I outlined as follows: Ihe first million
i will be an addition to the permanent
endowments of the I niversity to be ap
! plied to improved conditions in the fac
! ulty salaries; the second million will be
a special fund to augment the money
that is now normally available for build
ing purposes: the third million will be
, a special endowment fund for the Stan-
I ford clinic and hospital. Ihe raising of
| this amount will probably be undertaken
! in San Francisco.
