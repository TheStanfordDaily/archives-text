# ST. IGNATIUS TO OPPOSE VARSITY IN BASKETBALL CLASH TOMORROW NIGHT
## Fremont High School will Furnish Strong Opposition to First-Year Quintet in Preliminary Contest 
### 
St. Ignatius, no longer the feared
quintet of years gone by, comes to the
campus tomorrow night, in an attempt
to check the onward rush of the Car
dinal varsity, in the last game of the
preliminary season.

For the first time since the open
ing of the basketball season, Van
Gent's men will go into the fray as
distinct favorites.

The standing of the Stanford team
has changed more in the short week
and a half since the first game with
Santa Clara, than it probably will the
rest of the season. Two weeks ago
basketball fans were wondering where
Van Gent would get three men who
would make a creditable showing. The
Santa Clara game served to introduce
Janssen, McHose and DeGroot. The
Pacific game a week ago founded the
belief that the 1922 Cardinal quintet
was a formidable one. A hard-earned
victory over the Olympic Club proved
that tl)e five Van Gent has developed
is among the leading teams on the
Coast.
Although the Cardinal is conceded
the advantage tomorrow night on the
basis of comparative scores, Van Gent
will probably start his ieguiar line
up of Davies, McHose, forwards; Jans
sen, center; Richmond and DeGroot,
guards.
If the first-string line-up piles up a
safe lead, several new faces will prob
ably appear on the varsity. Howell,
at center, and Anderson at running
guard, are substitutes who have gone
in before, but Van Gent has several
other promising candidates in reserve.
Santa Clara has contributed two
members to the Ignatian quintet. Don,
who is oue to start at center, although
he didn't play in the St. Ignatius-Santa
Clara contest two nights ago, is a Mis

Fremont High School and Coach Duf
fy Seay's freshman basketball squad
will play in the basketball pavilion to
morrow night at 7:15, as a preliminary
to the Stanford-St. Ignatius game.

Winner of the O. A. L. league last
season, Fremont High School has de
veloped a fairly fast team again this
year under the tutelage of Street. Ac
cording to those who have se.en the
high school men in action, they have a
pair of rangy forwards who are dan
gerous men under the basket, although
they are not particularly fast.

The addition of Hooper to the squad
has materially strengthened the playing
of the team, and Coacli Seay is grad
ually building up a team that is able to
play together and to pass and place
baskets with some precision.

He has been using all of his men in
different combinations in order to pre
pare for a cut in the squad at the end
of this week. At forward, Christensen,
Alexander, Driscoll, and Brace have all
been playing a good game, with the
first two men as the best prospects.

Shipke and Hooper at running guard
both play a fast game, with Hooper hav
ing the edge because of more, expe
rience at this position. Shipke played
center in high school and for a time was
used by Coach Seay as a forward, but
he seems to handle guard better than
either of his former positions.
It is at center that the most difficulty
will be experienced in selecting a man.
Logan, Steele, and Middleton are about
equally good, and it is possible that all
three may be retained on the squad.
Houck, Oliva, and Thede all play a
steady game at standing guard, with
Oliva showing more ability in getting
the ball away from the. basket than the
other two.
The names of the men surviving the
cut in the squad will appear Monday.

Regardless of the results obtained,
the Saints are represented by a team
of basketball thoroughbreds. They
may lack the dash and spirit of young
er players, but they do knok basket

John J. Connolly, St. Ignatius coach,
is more widely known as a sport writer
on a San Francisco paper than a bask
etball mentor. Connolly is a student
of the theoretical side of the gr*"' l
and his men probably have a trie!
two tucked away.
The Stanford varpity will leave
day for Oregon to play a twog
series with both the University of
Oregon and the Oregon Aggies.
