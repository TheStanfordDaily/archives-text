# ARTIST WILL MAKE FIRST APPEARANCE HERE TUESDAY
## 
### 
Although her concert in the Peninsula
Association series next Tuesday even
ing will be, Madame Helen Stanley's
first appearance at Stanford, she is not
a stranger to California audiences. Last
season she made a concert tour of the
coast, and was warmly received in all
the leading cities of the state.
An element in her programs con
sidered particularly noteworthy by crit
ics is her discrimination in the selec
tion of her programs.
Madame Stanley is constantly inter
ested in discovering and presenting new
song literature which is little, or not at
all known. For a single recital pro
gram of approximately twenty numbers,
she is said to have searched through
some three to five hundred compositions
in order to find exactly the type and
contrast of songs she. requires. Lead
ing authorities have called her a "con
sistent!/ satisfying concert artist."
During Madame Stanley's tour of the

west last year tlie Los Angeles news
papers viewed licr work with the Phil ]
harmonic Orchestra there with enthu
siasm, while Ray Brown, musical critic
of the San Francisco Chronicle, said of
her appearance in San Francisco:
"Her conquest of the audience was
made in her first group of songs and
approval waxed steadily in warmth
throughout the program. Madame Stan
ley has the individual charm that
awakens attention quickly and her vocal
loveliness is one that gives instant and
continued delight. Her flexible ease <>f
utterance, suavity of pianissimo shad-1
ings, delicate accuracy in attack and
purity of pitch arc admirable. Her low
est register contains several notes that
are pure, mezzo in quality, while her
uppermost tones are of the most chrys
talline lyric clarity. Tt is a voice de
lightful to hear, because of its absolute
reliability in placement and its grada
tions in timbre."
