Shortly before midnight last night the
cast of the Masquers' Society play, "The
Charm School," completed its final full
dress rehearsal. The characters have
fully adapted themselves to their roles,
the sets are all in order â€”everything is
ready for the rise of the curtain at 8:15
tonight upon what promises to be the
most genuinely popnlar three-act comedy
presented on the campus in some time.
Many good seats are still available
and will be on sale today in the. Ad
ministration Building and at the box
office this evening, according to Dick
Taylor. '23, president of the Dramatic
Council.
Last night's rehearsal proved that
Coach Gordon Davis showed almost per
fect insight in his choice of characters.
The cast offers almost unlimited oppor
tunities for individual interpretation.
The lead is played by Dick Richmond,
'21, as Austin Bevans, the automobile,
salesman with ideas of his own upon
how to run the girls' boarding school
which he has inherited from his aunt.
He resents the conspiracy of age to
limit youth's possibilities and endeavors
to teach the girls how to be charming,
[t is not until the last few minutes of
the play that he finally capitulates to the
charm with which he had wished to
instill the students.
Donaldine Cameron, '23, playing Elsie
Benedotti, president of the senior class,
causes the capitulation after pursuing
her idol through the three acts of
comedy.
Among the struggling young men
with whom Bevans lives, on the top
floor of a city rooming house, are Da
vid MacKenzie, a law student who
wanted to be. a farmer, and George
Boyd, an accountant who wanted to be
a violinist. MacKenzie's legal mind and
Boyd's unrequited love for Elsie are
among the many amusing features of
the charm school. David Lampson, '25,
is the law student, and John Vaughan,
'24, is the accountant.
The. antics of the self-opinionated
twins, whose allowance has been stopped
until they prove that the.y liave inten
tions of getting down to business more
serious than mastering the latest dance
steps, run through the entire play, liar
old Koike, '24, and Walter Alexander,
'23, are the Simpkins twins, Tim and
Jim.
Cecil Morris. '24, will appear as Ifo
mer Johns, choleric guardian of Elsie"
and divorced husband of Miss 1 laycs,
