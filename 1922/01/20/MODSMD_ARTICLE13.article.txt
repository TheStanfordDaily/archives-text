# EDUCATION WASTED UPON DULLARDS IS TERMAN'S BELIEF
## 
### 
A college education is wasted upon
a dullard, for it is useless to try to edu
cate him beyond his natural limits. This
is the conclusion which Professor Lewis
M. Terman of the Education Department
draws in an article in the current num
ber of the Scientific Monthly.
He bases his observations upon a se
ries of minute mental examinations
which he made of a student who, in
spite of apparent effort, failed to get
along in college. The student, who was
20 years old, proved by the tests to
have the mentality of a boy of twelve
and a half. He had managed to get
through a reputable high school in five
years and entered the university. But
he failed to succeed in his class work.
Professor Terman points out that it
is useless for this man to continue his
college work. By the Binet tests, which
Professor Terman has done much to
perfect, a situation of this kind might
be avoided and the student could be put
to some work which requires little men
tality and which he could do as well
as any one else.
This revelation of stupidity on the
part of a high school graduate does not
seem to Professor Terman as a menace
to America. He says that, if given the
same tests, 50 or 60 per cent of barbers
and teamsters, 70 or 80 per cent of un
skilled laborers, and 85 or 90 per cent
of American negroes would come out
with the same results.
