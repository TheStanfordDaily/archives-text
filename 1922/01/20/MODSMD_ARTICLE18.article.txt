The annual report of the President of the Uni
versity for 1918-19 contained an outline of the
plans and projects to he advanced during the ensuing
years. A review of that report shows that many of
the ambitions that President Wilbur outlined for the
Board of Trustees have become realities. The in
creasing of faculty salaries, the erection of a dam
to impound water for the campus and Palo Alto
farm, and the erection of a stadium for athletic sports
are a few of the things mentioned in the report which
have been accomplished. On the whole the Univer
sity has advanced according to the plan contained in
the report, but there is one phase in which retro
gression has taken place.
On June 5, 1919, the men of Encina Club sent a
message to President Wilbur in regard to student
conduct. ()ne sentence in that letter read : "The men
of Encina wish it to be known that freshman dis
cipline has been completely abolished."
On March 8, 1919, a message was received from
the then newly organized inter fraternity Conference
which contained a set of resolutions, of which the
third was as follows: "That the undersigned frater
nities- in full agreement will abolish freshman dis
cipline in our respective fraternity houses."
These resolutions and pledges were signed in each
case by men who had just returned from war serv
ice to leadership in their respective living groups.
Possibly their experiences in the service had made
them see how provincial and prep-schoolish the whole
system of freshman discipline at Stanford was. At
any rate, they, as representatives of the living groups
of which they were members, gave public notice that
they were done with freshman discipline.
These pledges have not been lived up to. There
are few specific instances to cite in support of that
statement, but anyone who is a member of the un
dergraduate body will be unable to deny it. Per l
haps it is because these older heads have finished
their courses and have gone into other fields that
we have slipped into the provincial attitude that
existed before the war. Are we of today less wise
than those men and are we going to continue to
perpetuate a system that is characteristic of a pre
paratory school ?
The answer to that question lies with the present
sophomore and freshman classes. There is probably
some truth in the adage, "You can't teach an old
dog new tricks." and the peculiar opinions formed
under the present system will be hard to dislodge
from upperclass minds. The present underclasses
have an opportunity to do away with the system of
freshman discipline and to substitute for it a system
of education for the incoming classes that will do
much more toward the promotion of the University.
