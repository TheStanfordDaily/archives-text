# Organized Assistance

The initial organized movement on the part of stu
dents to aid in the "First Million for Stanford" en
dowment campaign has been made by the Women's
Athletic Association, which has voted to turn over to
the endowment fund the proceeds from the pageant
which is to be given by the women on Alumni Day.
This may be taken as an indication of student
willingness to assist in furthering the best interests
of their University. The Women's Athletic Associ
ation has given a definite expression of readiness to
give first place to this new and important undertak
ingâ€”an expression which is of encouraging signifi
cance in denoting undergraduate attitude towards the
project. M. J. I .

THERE HAS BEEN SOME DELAY in starting
the basketball games promptly at the time for which
they are scheduled. Out of courtesy to the visiting

teams the Cardinal quintets should always l)e on the
floor a minute or two after the opposing teams come
out. Often there is a wait of fifteen or twenty min
utes between the preliminary game and the main at
traction. ' Most of this wait is not occasioned bv the
warming-up practice hut by the absence of one or
the other of the teams.
There is a point in starting the games on time,
especially the mid-week games, when students give
up part of their time to watch the contests and are
anxious to get back to their studies as soon as pos
sible.
