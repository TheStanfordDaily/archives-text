# THETA DELTA CHI NARROWLY DEFEATS ALPHA SIGMA PHI
## 
### 
One field goal and a free throw was
the margin by which Theta Delta Chi's
basket shooters defeated Alpha Sigma
Phi. 19 to 16, in last night's intramural
contest.
The game started out as a general
free-for-all, with poor passing and little
teamwork. After about five minutes,
however, each team acquired a more
systematic manner and played together.
Theta Delta Chi led at half time, 10 to 6.
Barliam, center, was the mainstay of
the winners. He scored most of the
baskets and followed the ball consistent
ly. After putting his team in the lead
during the last few minutes, Barnham
got cramps in bis legs and was forced
to leave the. game. Spurway, forward,
worked well with Barliam.
M,oore and Welch did the scoring for
Alpha Sigma Phi. Moore was the best
player and looped some pretty shots.
One of the weaknesses of both teams
was the lack of dribbling. In the last
half, when Theta Delta Chi was leading
by three points, two baskets in rapid
succession by Welch gave bis team the
advantage at 16 to 15.
Barham put Theta Delta Chi in the
le.ad again by tossing a field goal after
a fast passing play. For a considerable
period the game see-sawed back and
forth with neither team scoring, al
though several attempts at the basket
by the Alpha Sigma Phi forwards nearly
succeeded. Barham left the. contest in
the last three minutes, but another bas
ket by his team-mates put the game
on ice, 19 to 16.
