Too Late
In the dim and distant ages,
It is writ on History's pages,
Men were able to do almost as they chose,
But a social evolution,
That was almost revolution,
Changed our customs, and our habits, and our clothes.
» • *
Now at first a man could marry.,
There was none to holler, "Tarry,
You already have a dozen wives at home."
If you needed gold or treasure,
You could get it at your pleasure,
If you owned a pirate ship upon the foam.
If you had a hated rival,
Not for you the lawyer's drivel,
You could get your satisfaction from a fight.
If in trouble you were sinking.
You could always take to drinking,
Till your head was free from worries, and -hic-light.
But this long enumeration,
Is a useless dissertation,
For they've taken 'way our pleasures one by one.
E'en the good old gambling ticker,
Disappeared along with licker,
Now the Dumb Bellas have tobacco on the run,
And the latest legislation,
Makes a crime out of flirtation,
But it's useless on this question to debate.
But in ending this effusion.
There is only one conclusion,
Some of us were born a thousand years too late.

At last, after much expense, Cabbages has secured
the manuscript ot' Lucy Languor's latest novel, entitled
"The Most Thrilling Experience She Ever Had, or Her
First Proposal." This story contains a powerful appeal,
written by a woman with a keen insight into human
nature. Lucy Langour will be remembered by readers
of these pages as the one who was responsible for
"Married or Otherwise," "The Lover's Leap, or the Un
fastened Bar-pin," "Curtained Windows," and so on.

Chapter One. The Slip:—Mary Smith, called by her
friends Theodocria for brevity, was asleep. There was
nothing queer about this, as it was night. It was dark
outside. Wlfen Mary had turned out the candle, it was
dark inside.
As Mary lay there sleeping, a dark figure stalked tiny
the night and across the back yard, keeping close to
the ground. As it slank nearer and nearer to the win
dow which Mary lay inside of, it crouched, and stopped.
Ah-h-h-h-h! It was a cat. Its baleful blue eyes gleam
ed in the night and thru the window. With a snarl
resembling a baked potato, it lept thru the open window.
Mary awoke with a start, but stopped upon recognizing
the cat.
"Ah kitty, come to Theodocria," she purred. The cat
did. Feeling thru the intense darkness, she found it —
the note tied around the cat's neck. Eagerly she read
it aloud.
"Meet me in the alley near the ashcan. I am wound
ed.", —Herschel.
Slipping on her dressing gown, she dashed wildly
on tiptoes down the hall. As she went past her father's
room she slipped in and slipped on his overcoat and
derby hat. Then, as she went out the front door she
slipped on the bottom step. Thus disguised, she slipped
out the back gate.

Chapter Two. The Broken Bottle: —The darkness
in the alley was black as night, but Mary knew the
way to the ash-can from experience. Stumbling along,
she approached it. "Herschel," she called In a tremb
ling whisper.
"Theodocria," he answered. Daintily tripping over the
scattered tomato cans that had been thrown into the
alley, she fell into his arms.
"My Herschel," she gargled, "you are wounded.
Where? Who?
"'Tis nothing, dear," he answered, "I was opening a
bottle for some friends —the bottle-opener slipped and
I cut my finger."
"And does your finger hurt very much?" cooed Theo
docria.
"No, it isn't my finger. When the bottle-opener slipped
I dropped the bottle —it broke —my friends became very
angry—and when I woke up they had all gone."
Chapter Three. The Proposal:—As they stood there
by the ash-barrel, Herschel cried in an earnest tone:
"Theodocria, I can not bear to part from you. Marry
me, Theo!"
"All right," answered Mary, "but I must go now.
It's cold."
So they shook hands warmly, and parted.
Theodocria had her first proposal.
