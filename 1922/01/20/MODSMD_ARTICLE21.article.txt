"The $200,000 deficit, which the Uni
versity incurred within the past two
years, is in itself sufficient explana
tion of the pressure under which Stan
ford is operating," said J. E. McDow
ell. alumni secretary, in an interview
today. "This deficit, which has come !
even though a tuition fee was charged, I
Was caused not by expansion, but by j
the changed economic conditions
under which the University has been
forced to carry on its arranged pro- I
gram."
The Board of Trustees is at present '
concerned with two problems, Mc-
Dowell continued; first, to maintain
: the present high academic standard,
and second, to improve the present
conditions in the salary scale and to !
look forward to demands for more
building.
j "Stanford has one comfort," said
| McDowell, "practically every universi-1
I tv in the country is in identically the
, same condition. The efforts of the j
l alumni and students to maintain the
l standards, and actually to save the |
I lives of their institutions, lias brought'
I them into a closer partnership with 1
j the university officialsâ€”all working to- !
j gether for a common cause."
