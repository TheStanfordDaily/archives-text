## KANSAS HAS SPECIAL "HELLO DAY" FOR ALL 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS, Jan. 20.
â€”The annual and all-inclusive "Hello
Day" took place Wednesday, on the
U. of K. campus. On that day every
student and instructor was supposed
to greet whomsoever he met, whether
distant coed or haughty upperclass
man, with a cordial "Hello," and the
timid freshman thus has his chance
to throw a greeting at anybody any
where. This is an annual event at U.
of K., and is supervised by the Y. M.
C. A. and the Y. W. C. A.
