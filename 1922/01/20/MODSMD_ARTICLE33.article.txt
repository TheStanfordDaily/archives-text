# WEST CHINA TOPIC OF Y.W.C.A. TALK
## 
### 
West China with its strange customs
and clianging social conditions was the
subject of Miss Inez Marks' talk at the
Y. W. C. A. meeting Thursday at 5
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse. Miss
Marks returned last August after five
years' service in educational work in
West China. This section of China lies
next to Thibet, and is a country of limit
j less natural resources, held back from
economic development by the difficulty of
building railroads into the interior.
Chengtu, which was Miss Marks' head
quarters, was 1,000 miles from the near
! est railroad.
Quoting a modern writer as saying
! that the greatest of all China's undevelop
ied resources is her womanhood, Miss
j Marks continued:
"The present day Chinese girl is sec-
I ond to none when she lias the educational
advantages of her Occidental neighbor.
| Sue has a fierce patriotism that makes
her desire more than anything else to do
| something for her country. The Chinese
, girl is standing on the threshold, peering
j into an uncertain future.; she does not
want marriage but the opportunity to
| help her beloved China. y\t a recent
student conference in China attended by
( 2,000 women and 5,000 men, the women
! were treated with all the courtesy award
led their sisters 111 western lands. One of
, the chief speakers was a woman. This
! was a revolutionary thing in China,
j "It was the force of public opinion
j that drove the Japanese element from
i China and it rests with the students to
. bring their country out of its present up
heaval to sanity. China is merely going
i through the revolutions that have marked
the development of other nations."
Regarding her own work in China,
i Miss Marks said in part:
"Interior China is the safest place in
the world for an American girl to travel.
! Her nationality secures for her the fa
j vors and protection of all with whom
she comes in contact; China has the
i nicest robbers in the world and these men
j treat American 'victims' with much con
| sideration!
"To Occidentals, many Chinese beliefs
! seem naive to say the least. According
to the Oriental, all spirits move only in
| straight lines; therefore, in China, the
streets and roofs of the houses are curved
|to thwart the spirits. A son, to show his
j love and reverence for his father, buys
a coffin if the father happens to become
1 ill. When a person dies, firecrackers,
drums, and every available noise are used
to aid tile spirit in making its escape
1 from the casket.

"In the Chinese language, different
tones change the meaning of words, and
foreigners make many ludicrous state
! ments by using the wrong tone on the
right word. The principal of the
' Chengtu school thought that he was tell
| ing his Chinese boy to hang the Ameri
i can flag 011 the gate, but actually told
him to hang the wife of the principal 011

! the gate.
"Along with the coining of western
j education to China, has been introduced
many harmful influences. America al
lowed a $30,000,(100 brewery corporation
to establish a factory in China; China
had no cigarettes until the coming of the
J Americans; and Japan is increasing its
Chinese opium traffic.
"Contrary to general belief, the bind
j ing of girls' feet is still practiced in the
interior. This is in accordance with the
teachings of Confucius, who said, Ab
! sence of ability in a woman is a virtue.' "
Miss Marks showed the audience a
j three-inch shoe which she said was not
small according to Chinese sizes. She
| also had a small model of the sedan chair
used for travel in China, and a pig's
[ shoe made of woven grass fibre, l'igs
i are highly valued in China and must
| wear shoes in the rainy season to pre
| vent their slipping off the narrow stone
! paths into the rice fields and causing trou
ble to the farmer and damage to the rice.

The national Y. \V. C. A. is sending
Miss Marks to student associations all
over the states to discuss her work in
West China.
West China with its strange customs
and clianging social conditions was the
subject of Miss Inez Marks' talk at the
Y. W. C. A. meeting Thursday at 5
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse. Miss
Marks returned last August after five
years' service in educational work in
West China. This section of China lies
next to Thibet, and is a country of limit
j less natural resources, held back from
economic development by the difficulty of
building railroads into the interior.
Chengtu, which was Miss Marks' head
quarters, was 1,000 miles from the near
! est railroad.
Quoting a modern writer as saying
! that the greatest of all China's undevelop
ied resources is her womanhood, Miss
j Marks continued:
"The present day Chinese girl is sec-
I ond to none when she lias the educational
advantages of her Occidental neighbor.
| Sue has a fierce patriotism that makes
her desire more than anything else to do
| something for her country. The Chinese
, girl is standing on the threshold, peering
j into an uncertain future.; she does not
want marriage but the opportunity to
| help her beloved China. y\t a recent
student conference in China attended by
( 2,000 women and 5,000 men, the women
! were treated with all the courtesy award
led their sisters 111 western lands. One of
, the chief speakers was a woman. This
! was a revolutionary thing in China,
j "It was the force of public opinion
j that drove the Japanese element from
i China and it rests with the students to
. bring their country out of its present up
heaval to sanity. China is merely going
i through the revolutions that have marked
the development of other nations."
Regarding her own work in China,
i Miss Marks said in part:
"Interior China is the safest place in
the world for an American girl to travel.
! Her nationality secures for her the fa
j vors and protection of all with whom
she comes in contact; China has the
i nicest robbers in the world and these men
j treat American 'victims' with much con
| sideration!
"To Occidentals, many Chinese beliefs
! seem naive to say the least. According
to the Oriental, all spirits move only in
| straight lines; therefore, in China, the
streets and roofs of the houses are curved
|to thwart the spirits. A son, to show his
j love and reverence for his father, buys
a coffin if the father happens to become
