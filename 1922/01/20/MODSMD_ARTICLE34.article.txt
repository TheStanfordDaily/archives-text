### 
UNIVERSITY OF" CALIFORNIA,
Berkeley, Jan. 20. â€”The search for the
old college bell is being continued on
the California campus. There is a per
sistent report that the bell was spirit
ed away by Stanford students at the
time North Hall was demolished. The
alumni group does not give touch
credit to this report, however. If any
substantiation of therumor appears, j
President Barrows will be asked to
open negotiations with the Stanford
authorities looking toward the restora-;
tion of this priceless heirloom. The j
college bell is the oldest link connect- !
ing the U. C. of today with tha col- j
lege of fifty-five years ago.
