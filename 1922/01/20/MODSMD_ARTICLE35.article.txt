# Barbarians, Cardinals, Open Soccer League In Tomorrow's Game
## 
### 
Activities 011 the soccer field will once
more be under way when Stanford meets
j the Barbarians tomorrow in the first game
! in the second half of the University and
Club Soccer schedule.
The Barbarian team is one of the
strong teams in the league, and although
I it finished fourth in the first half of the
j schedule, it was not due to the fact that
the Barbs did not play real soccer. The
games they lost were hard fought battles,
and they were .the constant trouble mak
ers for the leaders of the league. They
have been going at top speed of late, and
a glance at their standing in the San
1 Francisco Sunday league shows that they
are making ,rapid strides towards the
| leadership of city soccer teams.
Coach Maloney's men will have to
work hard in order to send this squad
down to defeat again. Practice during
the week has shown the Cardinal squad
in good condition, although the team it
; self has a few roughs spots to polish off.
The trio of halfbacks are probably the
strongest in the league. Mike Mendonca
{ is playing in his old position at full, but
- 1 the chances are good that he will be
placed at center forward in case the
| Cardinal aggregation needs a couple of
' points. Dixon Clark, a new man this
) season, is showing his worth at left full
> back and is proving an apt team-mate
| ( for Mendonca. The addition of Carey
1 and Green to the forwards gives the Stan
ford men a better chance to break into
the scoring columns.
When Stanford takes the field, it will
be working under two difficulties. The
first handicap is that the members of the
team have had but very few games in
I which they have worked together, and
| the second is that an entire reorganization
| of the team was necessary due to the fact
j that several of the men who were 011
the varsity last quarter are now out for
baseball and track. This coupled with
the fact that the game is to be played in
San Francisco will make this meet ex
ceptionally difficult for the Cardinals.
The probable line-up for tomorrow
will be: Masters, gg; Mendonca, rf;
Clark, If; Taylor or Walthers, rh; Frank
lin, ch; Capt. Norman, lh; Green, or;
G. Clark, cf; Carey, ol; Mesa, il. Peavy,
Hayes, and Robinson will also be taken
along in case reinforcements arc needed.

and they were .the constant trouble mak
ers for the leaders of the league. They
have been going at top speed of late, and
a glance at their standing in the San
1 Francisco Sunday league shows that they
are making ,rapid strides towards the
| leadership of city soccer teams.
Coach Maloney's men will have to
work hard in order to send this squad
down to defeat again. Practice during
the week has shown the Cardinal squad
in good condition, although the team it
; self has a few roughs spots to polish off.
The trio of halfbacks are probably the
strongest in the league. Mike Mendonca
{ is playing in his old position at full, but
- 1 the chances are good that he will be
placed at center forward in case the
| Cardinal aggregation needs a couple of
' points. Dixon Clark, a new man this
) season, is showing his worth at left full
> back and is proving an apt team-mate
| ( for Mendonca. The addition of Carey
1 and Green to the forwards gives the Stan
ford men a better chance to break into
the scoring columns.
When Stanford takes the field, it will
be working under two difficulties. The
first handicap is that the members of the
team have had but very few games in
I which they have worked together, and
| the second is that an entire reorganization
| of the team was necessary due to the fact
j that several of the men who were 011
the varsity last quarter are now out for
baseball and track. This coupled with
the fact that the game is to be played in
San Francisco will make this meet ex
ceptionally difficult for the Cardinals.
The probable line-up for tomorrow
will be: Masters, gg; Mendonca, rf;
Clark, If; Taylor or Walthers, rh; Frank
lin, ch; Capt. Norman, lh; Green, or;
G. Clark, cf; Carey, ol; Mesa, il. Peavy,
Hayes, and Robinson will also be taken
along in case reinforcements arc needed.
