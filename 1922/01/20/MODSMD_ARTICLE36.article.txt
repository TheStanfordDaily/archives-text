## 
### 
• | Much interest is being evidenced in I
1 both Stanford and l'alo Alto comnumi- \
j ties regarding tlie concert which is to
be given by the well known Swiss yod
i lers, Frit/ Zimmerman, tenor, and Mar
• ! celle Grandville, soprano. Folk song*
t and yodels of Switzerland, both in solo
• ! and duet form, arc to be the main fea- j
, | turcs of the program. Zimmermann is |
• j considered the world's greatest yodler ,
• I and both of the artists who have full,
1 ! rich voices have been enthusiastically j
i ' greeted in all their appearances in this j
■ j country so far.
.• It is said, besides the wide range and
I pleasing quality of their voices, that
)1 both the singers have considerable dra
-1 matic ability.
? Following Mr. Zimmermann's appear
-1 ance in Portland, Oregon, this com
- ment was made in a review of the en
. j tertainment: "The attendance at the
Swiss concert was the largest recorded
i"j at the Auditorium since the concerts
I of John McCormick and Luise Tetraz
' j zini. Zimmermann came heralded as
' ! the greatest living yodler, and those
i j who heard him lure will gladly sup
» port that claim."
• j Miss Grandville and Zimmermann are
' said to appear to best advantage in
their duets. The common supposition
■ with regard to yodling is that it is a
' method of expressing music by tricks
of the voice, but the artists who are
' j to appear Saturday night will give evi
! dence of the fact that for every mood
i of the mountains there is a musical call.
1 j This concert is decidedly an innova
| tion in the line of music and one of the
1 j most unique ever given at Stanford.
