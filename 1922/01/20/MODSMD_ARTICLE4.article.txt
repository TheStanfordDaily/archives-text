# LIFE OF STUDENTS IN AMERICA AND EUROPE COMPARED BY HULME
## 
### 
European students have a great de-1
sire for study, but they do not care to
put their knowledge into practice; in j
America, students are more interested
in affairs outside college curricula, j
but they want to get out in the world j
at once and make practical use of
what they have learned. This was the j
contrast made by Professor Edward |
M. Hulme, who has spent the past
year studying in Europe, in his talk
to Euphronia Society last night on
"American and European Universi-1
ties."
"The European student," said Pro
fessor Hulme, "uses his knowledge of
art, science, philosophy, and religion,
merely as an intellectual background
for a life of leisure â€”the life of the j
'gentleman,' who does not take an j
I active part in the everyday affairs of
his community. In America there is !
a strong desire for reality, for a I
chance to make things better in the j
country.
"European colleges have no campus
es," he said, "but are usually set right:
in the midst of cities. The students \
are not restricted or cared for by Uni-!
versity authorities; each man is on
his own responsibility for his conduct.
There are no regularly organized ath
| letic programs, most colleges not go-1
ing in for any sport whatsoever,
j Scholarship and the social diversions '
j of the town make up the life of a uni- j
versity man in Europe."
