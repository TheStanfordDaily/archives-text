# BRITISH FIFTEEN FALLS BEFORE CARDS, 45-0
## Varsity Outclasses Sailors And Wins With Ease; Wilcox and Templeton Star 
### 
The Cardinal rugby fifteen outplayed
the H. M. S. Raleigh team in every
department of the 'contest yesterday
afternoon at the stadium and ran uo n
score of 45 to 0. The British sailors
fought hard but proved to be 110 match
for the Cardinals. Owing to the cold
weather a very small crowd was pre.
ent to witness the game.
The Stanford team had the ball in
their opponents' territory nearly the en
tire time and at no time were the sailors
near enough to the Stanford goal to be
dangerous. The Stanford team scored
practically at will.
Stanford played the entire second half
\yith only fourteen players, as the Eng
lish rule forbids the using of substi
tutes.
One of the. features of the game was
the kicking of "Dink" Templeton. He
converted nine touchdowns and time
after time sent the ball front forty to
sixty yards to touch.
The Englishmen had very little op
portunity to show what their backfield
could do as the Cardinal forwards broke
up every play or caught the half-back
before he could send the ball to his
backs. The sailors' greatest weakness
appeared to be in their tackling as they
hit their opponents too high with the
result that they could not bring the
men to the ground.
Lynn, Hazeltine, Wilcox, and Wrenn
were the stars for the Cardinal, while
Forrest stood out above his team-mates.
The H. M. S. Raleigh team was weak
ened slightly because of the absence of
its captain, who was unable to play due
to an injury.
The scoring began after the first four
minutes of play when Art Wilcox
slipped through the sailor's defensive
for a pretty 40-yard run to the goal
line. Templeton kicked the. goal.
Lynn marked the ball for a free kick
when the kick-off was made by the Eng
ish team. Templeton kicked to touch
on his opponents' 30-yard line. Stan
ford gained the ball on the line-out and
a passing rush was started which re
sulted in Hazeltine's crossing the line
for the second score. Temple.ton again
converted.
Hazeltine received the ball on the
kick-off and after a pretty exhibition
of open field running in which all the
Cardinal backs participated, the ball
was carried ove.r the line by Pat Carey.
The goal was converted.
For the next five minutes the for
wards of both teams were kept busy
dribbling back and forth about the cen
ter of the field, but soon the students
proved too much for the sailors and the
ball was kicked over the goal line. The
Raleigh fullback missed the pig-skin as
it rolled over the line and Lynn fell on
it for Stanford's fourth score.
The next score was made when the
forwards had advanced the ball to the
sailors' 10-yard line and Lynn received
the ball from the scrum and squeezed
his way to the line. The first half ended
soon rifter Templeton had made the con
version.
The second half opened with the score
reading 25 to 0, but it was soon evident
that the Cardinal squad would make
several more scores before the game
was over. On a free kick Templeton
again surprised the visitors with a 60-
vard punt to touch. The Stanford back
field started a passing rush which ended
with Hazeltine scoring.
The last three touchdowns were
scored bv Shlatideman, Hazeltine, and
Myers. The Stanford forwards took a
very active part during the entire game
in carrying the. ball. They outplayed
their opponents in getting the ball out
of the storm, thus giving the Stanford
backficlds a decided advantage on of
fensive play. The tackling of the win
ners was very good.

H. M. S. Raleigh—Grnndle, Hopper.

The Cardinal rugby fifteen outplayed
the H. M. S. Raleigh team in every
department of the 'contest yesterday
afternoon at the stadium and ran uo n
score of 45 to 0. The British sailors
fought hard but proved to be 110 match
for the Cardinals. Owing to the cold
weather a very small crowd was pre.
ent to witness the game.
The Stanford team had the ball in
their opponents' territory nearly the en
tire time and at no time were the sailors
near enough to the Stanford goal to be
dangerous. The Stanford team scored
practically at will.
Stanford played the entire second half
\yith only fourteen players, as the Eng
lish rule forbids the using of substi
tutes.
One of the. features of the game was
the kicking of "Dink" Templeton. He
converted nine touchdowns and time
after time sent the ball front forty to
sixty yards to touch.
The Englishmen had very little op
portunity to show what their backfield
could do as the Cardinal forwards broke
up every play or caught the half-back
before he could send the ball to his
backs. The sailors' greatest weakness
appeared to be in their tackling as they
hit their opponents too high with the
result that they could not bring the
men to the ground.
Lynn, Hazeltine, Wilcox, and Wrenn
were the stars for the Cardinal, while
Forrest stood out above his team-mates.
The H. M. S. Raleigh team was weak
ened slightly because of the absence of
its captain, who was unable to play due
to an injury.
The scoring began after the first four
minutes of play when Art Wilcox
slipped through the sailor's defensive
for a pretty 40-yard run to the goal
line. Templeton kicked the. goal.
Lynn marked the ball for a free kick
when the kick-off was made by the Eng
ish team. Templeton kicked to touch
on his opponents' 30-yard line. Stan
ford gained the ball on the line-out and
a passing rush was started which re
sulted in Hazeltine's crossing the line
for the second score. Temple.ton again
converted.
Hazeltine received the ball on the
kick-off and after a pretty exhibition
of open field running in which all the
Cardinal backs participated, the ball
was carried ove.r the line by Pat Carey.
The goal was converted.
For the next five minutes the for
wards of both teams were kept busy
dribbling back and forth about the cen
ter of the field, but soon the students
proved too much for the sailors and the
ball was kicked over the goal line. The
Raleigh fullback missed the pig-skin as
it rolled over the line and Lynn fell on
it for Stanford's fourth score.
The next score was made when the
forwards had advanced the ball to the
sailors' 10-yard line and Lynn received
the ball from the scrum and squeezed
his way to the line. The first half ended
soon rifter Templeton had made the con
version.
The second half opened with the score
reading 25 to 0, but it was soon evident
that the Cardinal squad would make
several more scores before the game
was over. On a free kick Templeton
again surprised the visitors with a 60-
vard punt to touch. The Stanford back
field started a passing rush which ended
with Hazeltine scoring.
The last three touchdowns were
scored bv Shlatideman, Hazeltine, and
Myers. The Stanford forwards took a
very active part during the entire game
in carrying the. ball. They outplayed
their opponents in getting the ball out
of the storm, thus giving the Stanford
backficlds a decided advantage on of
fensive play. The tackling of the win
ners was very good.
