# Hot Water Retails at Ten Cents the Ounce; Ice-Picks in Demand
## 
### 
Cold, colder, and coldest â€”but none
of the three seems to adequately de
scribe the sample of the glaciest age
that has hit the campus for two nights
running. The thermometer on Mt.
Hamilton hit the skids for a drop to
eight degrees above zero yesterday,
and the campus wind has been com
ing direct from Mt. Hamilton. Reports
from drygoods stores in nearby towns
report a run on the woolen socks
amounting to a panic.
Several ice companies may liquidate,
as enough puddles around the cam
pus froze solid to illustrate graphically
the nature of a mild winter on the
Matterhorn. Reliable statistics pre
not on hand as to how many falls said
ice-sheets took out of pedestrians who
carelessly left their spiked shoes at
home, along with their ear-muffs and
portable heaters. A sheet of ice along
the shores of Lagunita tied up canoe
transportation.
