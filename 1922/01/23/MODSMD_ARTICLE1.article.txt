# HIGH STANDARD SET By COMEDY MEETS APPROVAL
## Masquers Features Comedy of Wide Appeal Instead of Usual English Subtleties 
### Kenneth N. Stewart, '23 
There were only occasional traces
of the amateur in the Masqeurs' So
ciety presentation of "The Charm
School," by Al'ce Duer Miller, and
Robert Miller, in the Assembly Hall,
Friday night.
"The Charm School," was three acts
of purely popular, selfevident comedy,
as contrasted with the subtlety of the
last campus production. The authors
had included some intensely humor
ous incidents, but at times resorted
to trite means of procuring laughs.
There was nothing particularly heavy
and the final curtain left the audi
ence in a pleasant, light-hearted mood.
There was a wide range of characters
which gave opportunity for clever in
terpretation by a happily chosen cast.
"But you have got "charm"—Austin
Bevans' concluding sentence, was apt.
For Donaldine Cameron as Elise Bene
dotti did have charm in her appear
ance, in her manner and in her voice.
Miss Cameron apperaed to better ad
vantage Friday night than in any of
her previous campus roles. Genuine
dramatic ability was manifested in her
♦'••cntic, trembling confession of love.
A late entrance, unattractive postures
and an occasional subjection of the
personality of Elise Benedotti to that
of Donaldine Cameron, were only
minor flaws.
Dich Richmond had the appearance
essential to hi? role and his facility
of movement and expression seemed
to belie the fact that this was his first
appearance as lead in a campus play.
Richmond has an excellent stage voice
and presence but he marred these
slightly by breaks in his lines and
by difficulty in controlling his amuse
ment.
Ivo Copeland's characterization, that
of the old maid secretary, was the
best and the most consistent in the
play. She made the most of the best
comedy situations which "The Charm
School" offered. Her ludicrous walk,
j vocal and facial expressions were so
carefully sustained that even the most
exacting could find no unfavorable
j criticism and spontaneous applause on
| her first exit proved that she had won.
immediate favor with the audience.
After an ineffective entrance, Au
gusta Corey, as Sally Boyd, procured
| a laugh with her every movement and
; every word except the few that were
: lost when she lowered her voice. Her
j interpretation of the predominating,
'flippant and coquettish boarding school
1 girl was difficult and well done.
Harold Rorke as Jim Simpkins car
ried most of the comedy of the first
j act and carried it well. A contagious
and mischievous smile, a youthful con
| ceit and an agility of movement, to-
I gether with laughable lines effectively
i put over, won the instant affection of
the audience. It would have been
difficult to make a better selection
for the roles of the Simpkins twins
than that of Rorke and Walter Alex
ander. Although Alexander had fewer
lines and appearances, he had most of
the qualifications that made his part
ner's work so successful, being handi
capped only by a poor stage voice.
Cecil Morris showed study and care
in his impersonation of Elise's irasc
ible uncle. For only a moment in the
first act he failed to give the impres
sion that he was an elderly and in
fluential man of the business world
rather than a college student. It was
when angered when he was at his
best and it was there, particularly,
that Morris showed the advantage of
stage talent and previous experience.
From the moment Elizabeth Noyes
made her first appearance, it was dif
ficult to imagine her as any other than
the capable Miss Hayes—so perfect
was her make-up and her preservation
of matronly dignity. Slight signs of
uneasiness were readily forgiven when
it was learned that Miss Noyes had
] stepped into the part just a day or two
ahead.
John Vaughn was at his best Fri
day night in the earnestness with
which he impersonated George Boyd
and David Lamson as David MacKen
zie was perfectly at ease at all times.
So well did they portray the feelings
of the struggling bachelors that they
secured the sympathies of their audi
ence at the start.
All of the girls of the senior class
at the Fairview School added effect
ively to the brightness of the comedy
with their impersonations of varying
types of girlhood. Frances Merrill
was charmingly vivacious; Mildred
Hoover was charmingly coy; Mary
Jane Clark wag charmingly timid;
Norma Meads and Marion Pritchard
completed the aggregation of charm
ing femininity.
Long waits between acts, noticeable
breaks in the action and the leading
man's tendency to disclose his amuse
ment were the outstanding evidences
that "The Charm School" was being
presented bv amateurs.
The ease and poise of the charac
ters and the manner in which they
waited for laughter to subside before
they went on with their lines reflected
the careful coaching of Gordon Davis.
These qualities and the perfection and
beauty of the sets, which were design
ed by Chrysella Dunker and executed
by Eugene Curtis, rivalled the pro
fessional.
