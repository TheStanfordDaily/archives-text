## 
### 
Turned away cold from the doors of
the Assembly Hall during the last acts
of "The Charm School," over fifty
Roughs went home nursing a great
grievance.
It was learned that it was not the
chilly reception or the desire to see the
play, hut the fact that their presence was
not desired which hurt their feelings
most. While looking hard on the out
side, the "Rough" has a tender heart
within and to be subjected to deep in
sults tears his soul in shreds. It is
said that some of the less hardened went
home crying.
Cheer up—the weather might have
had something to do with the chilly re
ception !
