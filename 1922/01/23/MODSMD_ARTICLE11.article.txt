# MALONEY'S SOCCERITES TRIM BARBARIANS. 5-0
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's soccer var
sity started the steam roller again when
they went up to San Francisco and
downed the Barbarians 5-0 in the first
game of the University and Club Soc
cer League. In the first half neither
team scored, and it took ten minutes
of the second for the Stanford men to
get up steam. When they did they had
things their own way and the Barbs
could not stop their terrifiic onslaught
on the goal.
Perhaps one of the reasons why the
Cards piled up such a score in the. sec
ond period of play was due to "Pat"
Carey. He shot four of the goals, and
he only entered the game in the last
half. Carey was one of the men that
made the trip North with the rugby
team this year.
Another one of Coach Maloney's
finds this quarter is Dick Clark, ho
plays left full. He has a hard, long
boot and seems to be in the. play ex
actly at the crucial moment.
Captain Gorman played in his usual
style and was Johnny-on-the-spot when
needed. George Clark at center for
ward was responsible for the other
score. He was always smothering the
kicks of the enemy's fullbacks, and it
was through him that many of the. scor
ing plays came. Claude Peavy and iler
bert Dwight at inside right and outside
right played consistently, even though
they were unable to score. Garrett El
more in the left wing position had a
bard row to hoe as lie played against
the Barbarian backfield ace, Archie
Bartleman.
