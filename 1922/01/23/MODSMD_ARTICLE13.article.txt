# ST. IGNATIUS WINS FROM CARDINAL QUINTET, 31-24
## Cronin, Davies Star as Saints Catch Stanford Five Off Form 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
St. Ignatius, long overdue, "arrived" last Saturday night just as the Card
inal varsity basketball squad was leaving for the north, and the result was the
first set-back of the season for Van Gent's hopefuls, 31 to 24.
St. Ignatius, involuntarily, was the wolf in sheep's clothing. The means of
disguise were three decisive defeats suffered by Connolly's aggregation at the
hands of California, Santa Clara, and Los Angeles Athletic Club. HasketbalV

fans quickly stamped the Ignatius as a
meet team, disregarding the presence of
four veterans of proved worth.
The contest was not more than live
minutes old when the spectators real
ized the Cardinal varsity had a man
sized job on its hands, and that St.
Ignatius, for the tirst time, looked good
on the floor, as well as on paper. When
Cronin, Ignatian center, lying flat on bis
back on the floor, tossed the ball through
the basket, it became apparent that the
elusive thing known as "Luck" was to
be on the side of the visitor*.
Cards Off Form
For one night the Cardinal court ma
chine became a disorganized aggrega
tion of five players. There we.re flashes
of the form displayed in the lirst three
contests, but the organized effort seemed
lacking. The pace, set by the Ignatius
was a hot one, and the superior weights
of their gurads, Needles and Boyle, soon
began to tell.
Close guarding and fast play pre
vented the Stanford attack from being
effective. Van Gent sent in Pitts, Koba,
and Howell in an effort to pull the Card
inal from behind, but none of the. three
could pierce the St. Ignatius defense.
Cronin is Nemesis
Cronin, Connolly's center, was the
Stanford nemesis. All he did was to
supply the points for St. Ignatius when
the points were needed. Seven field
goals were his evening's work. Captain
Davies, for the Cardinal, put up bis
usual brand of basketball, but the con
centrated efforts of the saints were too
much for him. The Stanford skippe.r
converted eight out of ten throws, and
tallied two field goals.
Play is Close
There was nothing unusual in the
first ten minutes of the fray. Ihe count
ran up to 10-8. lirst one side scoring and
then the other. Cronin then decided it
was time to do something, so he broke
through with two sensational shots.
McHose got his second and last basket,
making it 10-14. Johnson and Davies
each made a paid of points on free
throws and Cronin scored from the
field. The half ended 18-12, the Saints
leading.
Cards Lack Final Punch
Stanford adherents got a real chance
to cheer after the opening of the second
half when Davies, unaided, brought the
score to 20-19 in favor of the Ignatius.
Pitts, substituting for McHose, threw a
