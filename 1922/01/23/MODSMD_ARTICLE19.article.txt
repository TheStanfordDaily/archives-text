# The
						Matter of Co-education
## 
### 
As regards the question of co-education and pres
ent methods ot the "higher education" of women in
particular, Stephen Leacock in a recent issue of Col
lier s launches two attacks against existing theories."
"The fundamental trouble." he says in his first
argument, "is that men and women are different
creatures with different minds and different apti
tudes and different paths in life. There is no need
to raise here the question of which is superior and
which is inferior (though 1 think, heaven help me.
that 1 know the answer to that, too)." LI is second
and main objection to co-education, however, is more
definite. " There is a deeper trouble still. The ca
reers of the men and women who go to college to
gether are necessarily different, and the preparation
is all aimed at men's careers. The men are going to
he lawyers, doctors, engineers, business men and poli
ticians. And the women are not."
Both of these arguments, upon analysis and appli
cation to the facts in the case are not as substantial
as they may seem at first glance. In the first place,
women are constantly disproving old contentions
against their ability to take part in affairs outside for
mer narrow limits. The progress they have made in
entering new fields opened to them by changing con
ditions and conventions is in direct contradiction to
Mr. Leacock's belief in the wide diversitv of the
paths men and women have to follow.
His second contention is not in line with what we
have come to accept as the ideal of a University—the
development and dissemination of that culture which
can come only through contact with a wide variety
of people and ideas.
This "broadening influence" is the true mission
of a university. It is not to serve as a training school
for doctors, lawyers, and merchants —a matter which
should be incidental to a true university education.
Viewed in this light a university training is just as
essential to the intellectual development of women as
men, and the system of co-education justifies itself
in that it places the highest cultural resources at their
disposal. M. J. C.
