WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
China in Straights
The "open door" is causing considerable comment in
the Peruvian Silver mines, according to a dispatch from
Madagascar yesterday. Whether or not Secretary
Hughes will let matters take their own course or some
body else's has not yet been determined. The situa
tion is admittedly serious, though not important.
Big Fight
The Boquet Wrapper's Union, Local No. 89, started a
fierce verbal battle yesterday in the streets of London,
and not until noon were they quieted by the arrival of
a crowd of yellowjackets. Lloyd George, when asked
whether they ought to be encouraged or restrained by
force, said. "Yes. 1 think so." The situation is admitted
ly serious, though not Important.
Wall St. in the Ditch
Woolen stocks hit an awful slump today with the ad
vent of hot weather. Shorts and longs alike went
broke, although brokers were not brokest The bears
threw the bull, and Imports Preferred took another rise.
Skirts were selling short at 9 a m., but a heavy load of
Amalgamated Lead, dumped on at noon, broke the
market again. The situation is admittedly serious,
though not important.
Genoa Conference on the Rocks
The situation is admittedly serious, though not im
portant.
* ♦ *
Not having had the opportunity of having our milk
of human kindness changed to cheese by the Swiss yod
lers, we shall let Tuesday let loose on thatj But just a
suggestion for a new song—"Leave Me With a Yodel."
* * *
You couldn't be blamed for leaving anybody with a
yodel, especially if they tried to show it off. Unless
you happen to be hard of hearing.
* ♦ ♦
Put a yodeling attachment on your automobile and
you'll have something that will put action into the most
sophisticated pedestrian. "Fine New Grape Nuts Eight,
With Yodel Attached—s4soo." There's a market for
something like that. ,
* * *
Can a Swiss Collie yodel? A dog that could yodel
would be a money-making proposition, unless he got
loose at night and gave somebody a chance to pop him
with a 30-30.
* # *
That's one organization that is lacking on the cam
pus today—a Yodlers' Club. The Glee Club might take
up this great indoor sport and see what a hit could be
made.

Big Fight
The Boquet Wrapper's Union, Local No. 89, started a
fierce verbal battle yesterday in the streets of London,

a crowd of yellowjackets. Lloyd George, when asked
whether they ought to be encouraged or restrained by

Wall St. in the Ditch
Woolen stocks hit an awful slump today with the ad
vent of hot weather. Shorts and longs alike went
broke, although brokers were not brokest The bears
threw the bull, and Imports Preferred took another rise.
Skirts were selling short at 9 a m., but a heavy load of

WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
China in Straights
The "open door" is causing considerable comment in
the Peruvian Silver mines, according to a dispatch from
Madagascar yesterday. Whether or not Secretary
Hughes will let matters take their own course or some
body else's has not yet been determined. The situa
tion is admittedly serious, though not important.
Big Fight
The Boquet Wrapper's Union, Local No. 89, started a
fierce verbal battle yesterday in the streets of London,
and not until noon were they quieted by the arrival of
a crowd of yellowjackets. Lloyd George, when asked
whether they ought to be encouraged or restrained by
force, said. "Yes. 1 think so." The situation is admitted
ly serious, though not Important.
Wall St. in the Ditch
Woolen stocks hit an awful slump today with the ad
vent of hot weather. Shorts and longs alike went
broke, although brokers were not brokest The bears
threw the bull, and Imports Preferred took another rise.
Skirts were selling short at 9 a m., but a heavy load of
Amalgamated Lead, dumped on at noon, broke the
market again. The situation is admittedly serious,
though not important.
