# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
AT THE CONFERENCE.
The American policy of keeping the
"open door" in China open was strength
ened by the resolution passed in the
conference that all the secret agree
ments existing between the Far Eastern
powers represented at the conference
and China must be made public. Pend
ing the agreement on Shantung ques
tion, which is expected soon, the Si
berian question will be taken up by the
conference.
UNION OF NORTH AND
SOUTH IRELAND SEEN.
The meeting of the two premiers. Sir
Craig and Collins, seemed to indicate
that an amicable settlement of differ
ences between the two sections would
not take long. They agreed on the ap
pointment of a commission to define the
boundaries between the two govern
ments. A tentative arrangement was
also made for the meeting of the two
premiers in Ireland which if carried out
would be tantamount to a recognition of
the Free State by the Ulster govern
ment. The English troops are, in the
meanwhile, fast evacuating Ireland.
ANGLO-FRENCH RELATIONS
STILL STRAINED.
Poincare is expected to explain his
policy in a note, to Lloyd Cieorge today.
It is said that he will demand that the
Genoa conference guarantee the repara
tions clause. Nothing definite is yet
known as to the fate of the Anglo-
French pact â€¢which was about to be
signed when Briand was suddenly re
called from Cannes. A showdown on
the. part of the French is expected early
this week, and it is hoped that the two
nations will arrive at some agreement
thus assuring the calling together of
the Genoa conference early in March.
U. S. TO ARBITRATE BETWEEN
CHILE AND PERU.
The long standing differences between
the republics of Chile and Peru are. to
be submitted to arbitration of the I'nited
States, it was learned today. The boun
dary dispute has long kept the two na
tions on the verge of going to war,
which would lie certain to embroil the
greater part of the American continent
in the struggle. The news of the ar
bitration is therefore hailed by all
America.
WORLD MOURNS THE POPE.
The death of Pope Benedict is todaj
mourned all over the world. The world
press is unanimous in prasing the ef
forts of the late Pontiff in the direction
of world peace and conciliation. The
election of a success is expected very
soon.
