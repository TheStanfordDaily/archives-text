# ENDOWMENT PLANS MADE BY COUNTIES
## 
### 
Representatives of the alumni associa
tions of Santa Clara, San Mateo, and
Santa- Cruz counties met on the cam
pus Friday afternoon for a tour of the
buildings and a council regarding the
endowment campaign in their localities.
The three counties represented are to
form the first district in the general
campaign over the nation, and will be
divided into two sections at Palo Alto.
The first section will extend from Halo
Alto to the outskirts of San Francisco,
and the second will be the San Jose
district, taking in everything south of
Palo Alto. President Wilbur was au
thorized to appoint a chairman and two
assistants for the district, who are. to
work out the program of the sectional
and logical campaigns.
W. W. Kempt, '98, president of the
State Normal School, San Jose, who at
tended the conference, said in regard
to the opening of the appeal for funds:
"Stanford will gain more through the
campaign than a million dollarsâ€”it will
develop the loyalty of the alumni in a
way that nothing else could. Until one
has made some sacrifice for his univer
sity he cannot know what real loyalty
is."
Dinner was served at President Wil
bur's house at the conclusion of the
tour of the campus, after which the nec
essity and method of securing "The
First Million for Stanford" was ex
plained.
