## 
### 
Miss Helen Bunting, director of
Women's Athletics, has been asked to
represent the west at a meeting of
women athletes and directors held in
Philadelphia, Penn., this week-end for
the. purpose of organizing a Women's
Field Hockey Association of the United
States. Eastern enthusiasts for the As
sociation hope to further the develop
ment and power organization of the
sport throughout the country. They
propose to select and finance an all-
United States team to play a Canadian
team, or to go to England for a series
there.
It is hoped that not only will existing
clubs enter this organization and many
new clubs will be formed, but also that
sectional associations may be formed in
the endeavor to foster more skilful play
and more inter-club and inter-city play.
