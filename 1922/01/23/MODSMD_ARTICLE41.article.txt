# GOLF TRYOUTS WILL BE ANNOUNCED SOON
## 
### 
Ihe knickerbockered club - wavers,
seen along the row noon and night,
will have an opportunity to demon
strate their skill in the tryouts for the
golf team whiqh will be held next week.
Captain Millard Rosenblatt has not
completed arrangements, but the time
and place of the tryouts will be an
nounced in a few days. It is hoped
that about thirty men will compete for
places on the team.
Ihe old faculty golf course along the
Portola road, which runs behind the
lake, was being fixed by some students
last Sundays, and about fifteen were
practicing on it. 1 his increased interest
in golf is taken as a favorable indica
tion that there will be better material
for the team this year.
The greatest obstacle to be met is "to
find a good course on which to prac
tice, as the faculty course is in a very
run-down condition. It is hoped that
if the graduate manager's office guar
antees the bills of a certain number of
men, permission will be obtained to use
the Menlo Country Club. Although the
members of last year's team all belong
to organizations possessing courses, it
will be necessary to find a place where
all. including the new men, can practice.
The University of California has not
yet set the date nor selected the course
on which the Stanford-California match
will be played, but it is probable that
either the Claremont or the Sequoyah
courses at Berkeley will be chosen.
Both are sporty courses, and either one
would test the ability of the players to
the utmost.
Although Stanford was outplayed by
California last year, the Blue and Gold's
showing was not phenomenal. The
Cardinal golfers hope to get enough
good men to defeat California this time,
despite the sudden interest in golf at
Berkeley, where indoor apparatus has
been installed, and a branch in golf of
the physical education department es
tablished.
Men winning their match from Cali
fornia will receive a circle "S."
