# CONCERT PROGRAM OFFERS VARIETY
## Madame Helen Stanley Selects Representative Numbers In Peninsula Recital, Tuesday 
### 
A group of old Italian and traditional
English songs, several Russian and
Spanish selections, including an operatic
arias, a group of French, and one of
modern English songs will be included
in the program to he given by Madame
Helen Stanley in her concert in the
Assembly Hall tomorrow evening. The
program has been selected with a vie.w
to making it as representative as pos
sible, and entirely unhackneyed.
This program illustrate the. artists'
discrimination in selection, one of the
reasons to which critics attribute the
prominence which she has attained be
fore concert audiences. She has al
ways been particularly interested in dis
covering and presenting new and un
known songs from different nations and
literatures.
Of Madame Etanley's New York ap
pearance in Carnegie Hall last autumn,
the Evening Sun made the following
comment:
"In this age of suppressed superlatives,
it is at least safe to say that there is no
more limpid voice in America than
Madame Stanley's. Much else of beauty
lies in it. and in her use of it; much
which discovered yesterday at her aft
ernoon recital in Carnegie Hall by those
not already aware. Why she is not the
chief star of either one or the other of
our operatic firmaments is only ex
plained by her expressed purpose of de
veloping exclusively the intellectual side
of her art."
