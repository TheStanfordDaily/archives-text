### Henry Mack, '24 
Duffy Seay's freshman basket team
defeated the Fremont lligh School
team, 37-11, in the basketball pavilion
Saturday night.
With the exception of Prelli, running
guard, tlie high school men were light
and unable to oppose the heavier and
faster freshmen. Many of the shots
made by the Bahe forwards were en
tirely free, the guards of the high school
team being particularly inffeective.
The freshmen, on the other hand,
played better than in any previous game.
Teamwork was in evidence for the first
time this season, and the passing ability
of most of the squad has also im
proved.
Hooper and Alexander have developed
into a paii: of accurate forwards who
are fairly fast and who have the advan
tage of experience. These two men
started the game, and together were re
sponsible for more than one-third of the
points scored.
Middleton started at center, and Ship
ke and Oliva at guard. Oliva plays a
game at standing guard that resembles

tliat of Fred Adams, and he s«s
promise of developing into a clever
player. At present he shows more abil
ity in getting the. ball clear of the bas
ket than the other men playing this po
sil ion.
Prelli, of Fremont High School, was
the only one who broke into the point
column to any extent for the prep men.
He scored seven points of the eleven.

of men on the squad to fourteen at the
end of last week. Those surviving the
cut are: Forwards—Grace, Alexander,
