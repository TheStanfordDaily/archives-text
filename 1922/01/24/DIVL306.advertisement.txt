Does it hurt much
to own one?
THERE is a campus saying that if a man has
won a I'hi Beta Kappa key or other honorary
fraternity emblem, he had better keep it out of
sight when he goes looking for a job.
Still there are men who ranked high at college
and who haven't turned out altogether failures in
life. Strange though it may seem, more and more
such men are winning positions pretty high up in
the commercial and industrial world.
Call it chance. Say they succeeded in spite of
their scholarship. But, seriously, is it too much to
trace a logical connection between a man's pro
ficiency in getting ready for his vocation and his
success in that vocation ?
Surely it is common sense that the better grip
you get on your work now, the more easily you
can handle the big jobs later on. .
This question of scholarship is far bigger than
whether you like a certain emblem and the men
twlio wear it. The value of the emblem is what it
stands for —knowledge and the ability to think
straight. (
Develop this ability where and how you will,
but develop it—because in the world of affairs they
3 .i i, i
reward it liberally.
