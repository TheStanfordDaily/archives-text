# HELEN STANLEY TO BE CONCERT ARTIST TONIGHT
## Soprano Will Present Program of Wide Range in Third of Peninsula Musical Series 
### 
Madame HeJen Stanley, soprano, and
former member of the Chicago Grand
Opera Company, will be heard in the
third of the Peninsula Musical Associa
tion concert series which will take place
in the Assembly Hall this evening at
8:15 o'clock.

Although she is widely known in this
country through her reputation gained
with the Chicago Grand Opera Com
pany, as well as through her work as
a recital artist and the wife of Louis
Charlton, manager of the Opera Com
pany, Madame Stanley comes as a com
parative stranger to local audiences.
Last season she made a concert tour of
the coast and was warmly received in
all the leading cities of the state.

One of the reasons given by critics in
accounting for the prominence which
she has attained before the critical con
cert audiences of America is the fact
that she is constantly discovering and
presenting to her audiences new song
literature. That her efforts in this di
rection are untiring may be appreciated
when one considers that for a single re
cital program of approximately twenty
numbers, Madame. Stanley has searched
through some three to five hundred
compositions in order to find exactly the
perfect type and contrast of songs
which she requires. For this reason
she lias been termed a "consistently sat
isfying concert artist."
While with the Chicago Opera Com
pany Madame Stanley created the title
role of Massenet's "Cindrella." This
was in 1912. During the next six years
she sang over twenty leading roles, in
four different languages, and was re
ceived as an artist of high rank, vocally
as well as histronically. However,
with demands for concert work making
inroads on her free time, she has since
1918 chosen to devote herself to recital
engagements, with the emphasis on the
intellectual side pf her art which such
programs demand.
The program which Madame Stanley
has selected for this evening consists of
Italian and traditional English songs.
I and grotips of Russian, Spanish, French,
i and modern English numbers. At the
