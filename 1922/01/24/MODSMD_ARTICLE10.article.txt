## 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay, with his freshman
basketball squad cut to fourteen men,
spent last night drilling his charges on
the execution oT simple plays, and pre
paring them for the contest with Oak
land Technical lligh tomorrow night.

! With the first game with the Califor-
J nia freshmen a little over three weeks
i away, much yet remains to be clone in
rounding out a team that is able to play
together well. The main need of the
squad is accurate forwards; Alexander
and Hooper, who have been showing
fair form, have still much room for
| improvement before approaching the
] form exhibited by the freshmen of last
year, who were beaten by California in
two games, 37-21 and 42-17.
Commerce High School fell before
the Babe, quintet of '24 by a score of
24-7. This year a Commerce High
School team that has lost three of last
i year's stars via graduation, defeated the
j first-year men 20-17.
However, much improvement was'
I shown in the last game with Fremont
'11 ivjli School. Tomorrow night the
j freshmen meet the team from Oakland
! Technical High School, which defeated
I tin- California freshmen 10 7. The show
| ing of the Stanford Babes against this
team will do much toward determin
! ing their chances of defeating the Blue
1 and Gold on February 17.
