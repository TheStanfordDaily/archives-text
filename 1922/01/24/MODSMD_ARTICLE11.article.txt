## 
### 
Phi Kajipa Sigma, Alpha Kappa
Lambda, and Theta Chi were winners
in yesterday's intramural basketball
contests. These were the first games
scheduled under the afternoon system
now in effect, in which two games are
played in the afternoon and two in the
evening.
Phi Kappa Sigma took the wind out
of the Japanese Club's sails by defeat
ing the Japanese court men, 20 to 9.
The result was a surprise since the
latter team has lost no previous games
and was doped to make a strong bid for
the league plaque. However, the com
bination of Coulthurst, Fnright, and
Thomas proved to be too accurate and
too big for their opponents to cope with.
When given a chance, Koba dribbled
the ball like the. usual streak of light
ning tjiat he is. But in the meantime
Coulthurst made four baskets, and Fn
right and Thomas three each.
Alpha Kappa Lambda showed a high
class type of teamwork and let F1 Toro
down with one point, while piling up a
34-point victory. Short passes .with all
the play directed to two very accurate
forwards. Rawlins and Cornell, are the
secrets of the Alpha Kappa Lambda
success. Rawlins made seven baskets
and his shooting partner totalled six held
goals and two free throws. llowe, cen
ter, and Sloan, running guard, did good
work in their positions.
Theta Chi disposed of the Commuters,
taking the long end of a 23 to 11 score.
At the end of the first half both teams
were playing about evenly, but I beta
Chi got the drop in the second period.
1 logic, Smith, and Hollingsworth of the
winners form a dangerous combination.
Kellev was the best player on the trol
lev-linc squad.
