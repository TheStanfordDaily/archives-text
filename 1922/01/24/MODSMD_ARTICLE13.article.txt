# D. U. FIVE BLOTS BETA CHANCES FOR INTRAMURAL HONORS
## 
### 
Delta Upsilon's live captured a fiery
court contest from Bc.ta Theta Pi's bas
ket shooters last night, 11-6.

The winning quintet had the edge in
teamwork and passing. During .the first
half. I '.lack. Delta Upsilon center, looped
in two baskets which gave his team the
advantage at half-time, 4 to 0. Black
and Lacey, who played consistently and
did the scoring, working together
smoothly with the aid of another alter
mating forward and Atwill, running
guard. Atwill mixed into all plays that
approached anywhere near him, and
was mainly responsible for the strong
defense of the D. U. live.
Both teams went into the second half
with malice aforethought, and varied
and personal remarks from a large
gathering on the sidelines added con
siderable spirit to the game. The spirit,
in fact, was the most pronounced in
this contest than in any so far during
the season. The Beta Theta Pi war
riors put forth a brand of comeback
which seemed likely to reverse the luck,
but they were met by a Delta Upsilon
Onslaught which forced them to the de
fensive in the latter part of the game.
After a see-saw period of play. Dole
dashed under the basket and put the
ball through the hoop. This feat was
duplicated shortly by Mannoccir whose
field goal tied the score at four all. The
Delta Upsilon players jumped into a
three-point lead when Green shot a
basket and Lacey made a free throw.
Another field goal by Mannoccir re
duced this advantage to one point.
A considerable period of fast plav
occurred before a long pass from Lacey
to Black netted a basket. Two free
throws contributed by Lacey concluded
the scoring, despite the frantic last min
ute attempts of Beta Theta Pi to toss
the casaba through the hoop.
