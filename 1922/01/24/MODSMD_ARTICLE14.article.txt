# NEW PURCHASING PLAN SUGGESTED BY COMPTROLLER
## Roth Outlines General System of Co-operative Provisioning for Groups in the Future 
### 
Comptroller Roth addressed the In
terfraternity Conference last evening on
the subject of co-operative buying for
fraternities, sororities, and eating clubs.
He also explained the University's plans
for housing campus living groups in the
future.
According to the. general plan of the
co-operative buying outlined by Comp
troller Roth, the fraternities and eating
clubs will be represented by a buyer
who will purchase large quantities of
staple products wholesale, when the
prices are low. There will be a com
mon warehouse on the campus, to con
tain these supplies, which will be dis
tributed to the houses and clubs as the
need arises. To insure a substantial
credit to the buyer by which he might
conduct the large scale purchasing re
quired, each co-operative member would
contribute a certain amount toward a
general credit fund. Many details at
tached to the plan will have to be
worked out, according to Roth, but the
general idea was discussed from va
rious angles by tJie fraternity represen
tatives.
Acting upon the suggestion of Comp
troller Roth, Heaton Wrenn, president
of the conference, has appointed a com
mittee to investigate co-operative buy
ing plans of other universities and to
propose a similar scheme adapted to
conditions at Stanford. Considering the
fact that there are on the campus thirtyr
three fraternities and sororities, and
that each of these spends approximately
$500 per month for supolies, the co-op-

erative project assumes large propor
tions, according to the discussion.

Roth also considered the future Uni
versity housing plan, and answered
questions as to how the endowment fund
would be used in this regard. Probably
$250,000. he said, will go towards pay
ing for one-half the expense of three
dormitories, which will house students
who at present are unable to live on
the campus on account of the. lack of
housing facilities. According to Roth's
outline all University dormitories in the
future will be built on the unit plan.
Blue prints of the buildings will arrive
soon and will be shown to the confer
ence members.
The units will house four groups of
about thirty men each. livery group
will have one wing, upstairs and down
stairs, with a commodious living-room,
and four separate dining rooms will be
served by a common kitchen. 1 here
will be a large lobby at the entrance to
the unit, and above, the lobby it is
planned to have ten guest rooms for
visitors. In addition there will prob
ably be a general assembly hall for so
cial functions and gatherings.
In regard to reducing expenditures
on dances the motion was passed that
"the Tnterfraternity Conference go on
record as endorsing the spirit behind
the move to cut down excessive expen
ditures on dances." Committees to ar
range for exchange dinners was named.

general idea was discussed from va
rious angles by tJie fraternity represen
tatives.
Acting upon the suggestion of Comp
troller Roth, Heaton Wrenn, president
of the conference, has appointed a com
mittee to investigate co-operative buy
ing plans of other universities and to
propose a similar scheme adapted to
conditions at Stanford. Considering the
fact that there are on the campus thirtyr
three fraternities and sororities, and
that each of these spends approximately
$500 per month for supolies, the co-op-

erative project assumes large propor
tions, according to the discussion.

Roth also considered the future Uni
versity housing plan, and answered
questions as to how the endowment fund
would be used in this regard. Probably
$250,000. he said, will go towards pay
ing for one-half the expense of three
dormitories, which will house students
who at present are unable to live on
the campus on account of the. lack of
housing facilities. According to Roth's
outline all University dormitories in the
future will be built on the unit plan.
Blue prints of the buildings will arrive
soon and will be shown to the confer
ence members.
The units will house four groups of
about thirty men each. livery group
will have one wing, upstairs and down
stairs, with a commodious living-room,
and four separate dining rooms will be
served by a common kitchen. 1 here
will be a large lobby at the entrance to
the unit, and above, the lobby it is
planned to have ten guest rooms for
visitors. In addition there will prob
ably be a general assembly hall for so
cial functions and gatherings.
In regard to reducing expenditures
on dances the motion was passed that
"the Tnterfraternity Conference go on
record as endorsing the spirit behind
the move to cut down excessive expen
ditures on dances." Committees to ar
range for exchange dinners was named.
Comptroller Roth addressed the In
terfraternity Conference last evening on
the subject of co-operative buying for
fraternities, sororities, and eating clubs.
He also explained the University's plans
for housing campus living groups in the
future.
According to the. general plan of the
co-operative buying outlined by Comp
troller Roth, the fraternities and eating
clubs will be represented by a buyer
who will purchase large quantities of
staple products wholesale, when the
prices are low. There will be a com
mon warehouse on the campus, to con
tain these supplies, which will be dis
tributed to the houses and clubs as the
need arises. To insure a substantial
credit to the buyer by which he might
conduct the large scale purchasing re
quired, each co-operative member would
contribute a certain amount toward a
general credit fund. Many details at
tached to the plan will have to be
worked out, according to Roth, but the
general idea was discussed from va
rious angles by tJie fraternity represen
