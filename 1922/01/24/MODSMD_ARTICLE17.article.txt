# That Restless Feeling
## 
### 
He was just a small hoy, and it was awfully hard
for him to have to sit quiet for an hour while his
mother visited with her friend. Gee! didn't they ever
get through thinking of things to say? Why didn't
his mother say good-bye so that they could g<> home,
where, he wouldn't to sit in a straight-backed
chair and maintain the "little-boys-should-be-seen
and-not-heard" attitude? These are a few of the
thoughts that were running through his boy mind,
arid they caused him to become restless and to squirm
in his chair.
Many a time during our knickerbocker days has
each one of us gone through that same experience
and heaved onr sigh of relief when at last freedom
came and we were on our way home.
Some of us have brought that restlessness with us
to college. It is manifested in the attitude of stu
dents in the classrooms. The first fifteen minutes
we are all attention and not a word that the profes
sor says misses our willing ears. Then, remembering
that we have a watch, or, if we haven't, that our
neighbor has, we find out what time it is. Fifteen
minutes more of the lecture. "Well, that isn't bad,"
we soliloquize. So we listen for a few minutes more
and then look at our watches again. Why doesn't he
finish his lecture and let us out ten minutes early
today? He never seems to run out of things to say.
We become restless and start to squirm in our seats.
We scrape our feet upon the floor, close our note
books with a small clatter, put the caps on our pens,
and wait with a bored feeling until the hour-bell
finally rescues us.
How many of us forget that instruction is the thing
we came to college for? How often do we remember
that some one has made a sacrifice to enable us to
acquire an education? Do we <?ver think that the
University, our parents, and we ourselves are paying
for every minute of classroom instruction? The
last few restless minutes in a classroom would be
classed as an economic waste by an economist.
There is another side besides our own selfish feel
ing. Are we being courteous to the instructor ? Does
lie enjoy the lecturing any more than we enjoy the
lecture? Is he there to enjoy himself any more than
we are there to enjoy ourselves? It comes down to a
matter of work with him as it should be with us ? Let
us awaken ourselves to our own wastefulness and
share with him in his labors.
