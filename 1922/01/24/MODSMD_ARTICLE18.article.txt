# The 						Perpetual Student
## 
### 
Columbia University claims as a student a sixty
year-old man who registered there forty-one years
ago and hasn't missed a semester since that time. He
has attained many degrees and has accumulated a
great store of knowledge, but he is still only a student.
The man with a true and earnest purpose in life
does not go to college merely to accumulate knowl
edge, but to learn how to learn, as well as how to
apply such knowledge as he has gained, lie looks
forward eagerly, impatiently, to the time when he
can benefit both himself and his fellow men by ap
plying what he knows. Having once found the key
to knowledge, the ordinary student goes on learning
and applying what he has learned as long as he
lives. The ideal of every true student is never to
stop learning. Hut the man who gathers knowledge
merely to satisfy a desire for information that is
not to benefit his fellow men, directly or indirectly,
is of little use to mankind. He contributes nothing
to the welfare of his associates. Ile hands nothing of
value down to posterity. As a unit in society, he is
a failure.
The perpetual student must learn to his knowl
edge.
