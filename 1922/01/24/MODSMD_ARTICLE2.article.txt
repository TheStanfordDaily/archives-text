## 
### 
Many Palo Alto Art Club members
and their friends attended the invita
tional lecture delivered by G. L. Na
jarian, of San Francisco, in the Little
Theatre, Monday evening. The speak
er's topic was "The Oriental Civiliza
tion exemplified by the Art of Oriental
Hug Weaving," and he made it more
graphic by showing several costly
rugs as illustrations of the culture of
the Orientals.
Najarian, is an ardent enthusiast of
the Eastern textile art, and has done
much to stimulate interest in it by
delivering addresses before many Cali
fornia clubs.
He was born in Armenia, and his
education and travels have afforded
him the opportunity to study the cus
toms, history and legends of his land
and adjoining countries, as a youth.
He keenly observed the beautiful rugs
made by the natives and displayed in
the shrines, and in the houses of the
wealthier classes of the Oiient.
