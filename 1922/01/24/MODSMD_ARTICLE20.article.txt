# THE 						LAY OF A PHOEBE KEY
## 
### 
My Phoebe key has been with me since nineteen hundred •
and four,
And on the square, I won her fair, thougli some of thp
gang were sore.
I didn't mind being called a grind, and 1 wore her then
with glee,
And you can bet I wear her yet, right out where folks
can see.

In college days 1 won no bays in the giddy social rout;
I was de trop at any show where women were about.
1 tried for glee; but they soon dropped me, and a fresh

T hit the booze with others stews, but I couldn't stand
the pace.
At end I proved so punk I moved the football coach to
tears;
I was a dub, and on the scrub T played for three long
years.
I tried for third, but a faster bird took the regular job
from me;
And at the mile I plugged a wliile; my. best was a poor
5:03.
At every game it was the same; I never could reach
the top;
And though it's true I won a U, it wasn't a good, fair,
cop.
But the Phoebe key they handed me when I took my cap
and gown.
Was proof enough, if he has the stuff—you can't keep
a good man down.
Believe me, boss, it's been no loss, when hunting a job
or such,
To swing a key and let 'em see your brains don't need
a crutch.
I've got a hunch when you size the bunch that's setting
the pace today,
Along in the van you'll fiind a man who's wearing a
P. B. K.
