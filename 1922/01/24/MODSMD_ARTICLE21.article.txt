It is said that the hard-hearted pro
ducers of "The Charm School" turned
away fifty roughs who sought entrance
to the last acts of the play, last Fri
day night, at the Assembly Hall.
"How can such things be! 'Tis against
all tradition," wailed the roughs as
they gazed thru the windows at the
seats occupied only by those who paid
for them. Tradition —if you will ex
cuse the paraphrase—oftentimes cov
ers a multitude of abuses. And so
perhaps a word of explanation may not
come amiss at this moment.
The real reason which lies behind
the above mentioned cruelty lies with
in that spirit for economy and the cur
tailment of extravagance which is
endeavoring today to found new tra
ditions among campus institutions.
The free admittance of the campus
rough to University plays has become
such a growing expense that the class
or organization producing the play can
no longer afford it. An ever increas
ing number of the student body has
come to consider it not only an op
portunity but a divine traditional
right to walk in unchallenged by ridi
culous ticket takers almost any time
after the rise of the curtain on the
first act. In fact the so-called tradi
tion became so abused that many a
rough has been heard to boast that
he can witness any campus play free
of that silly contrary tradition —a
charge of admission.
In reply the play producers can only
say that until the day comes when it
becomes a tradition for merchants,
play brokers, costumers, etc., to sup
ply their materials free of charge it
remains necessary to set up an admis
sion price in order to pay these bills.
The Stanford rough is no fool. We
gladly admit that the most brilliant!
minds of the University are number-1
ed among his ranks, —and he reasons I
thus —"Why pay for a thing when you j
| can get it for nothing?" A highly
I logical, as well as a widely popular
deduction! But. University play pro
j ducing organizations have recently
! been trying more than ever before to
i lift the standard of play production, i
I They have adopted the slogan, "Give !
the public its money's worth!" Good i
things come higher, and care and at- j
tention to detail which go toward j
making a satisfying production are 1
only gained by increasing expense. II
is only bv this necessity for economy,
in order that every cent expended may
go into giving the man who has paid

for his seat his full money's worth :
that it has been found necessary to
withdraw the free dispensing of all
or part of that commodity—the stu
dent play.
And so until that happy day when
we have a University endowed theatre,
we must continue to suffer from an
admission charge to campus plays;
here the perspicacious reader may
anticipate our reasoning:—we have an I
idea that by doing away with free ad
missions that some day here and there
a rough may be moved to BUY a seat,
of perhaps,— (Oh, traitorous thought!)
to buy TWO seats! And thus you
see our nefarious plot exposed!—we
want' more money in the box office so
that we may pay more bills and pro
duce better plays.
