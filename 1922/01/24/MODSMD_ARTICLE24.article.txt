# Charles E. Boyle, Jr., ' 15, Serves Alma Mater and Country as Army Officer .
## 
### 
A few evenings ago, President Wil
bur remarked that the student leaders of
the R. O. T. C. deserved honor above
all other leaders of activity in the Uni
versity because they not only served
themselves and t,heir University, but
their country as well. If we can ex
tend his remarks a step further, and
apply them to a member of the military
I faculty, Captain Charles E. Boyle should
be given great honor. For Charles
Boyle, Stanford, '15, has chosen the
service of his country as his life work,
and as a member of the military faculty,
he is serving his Alma Mater, energeti
cally and efficiently. â€¢
Charlie Boyle came to Stanford from
Southern California, though Tennessee
claims him as a native son. Geography
may mean much or little; but one fa
miliar with Captain Boyle's love of.
horses, and his other pleasing character
istic traits, might say that he is a true
son of the South.
When he came to Stanford, a period
of athletic supremacy was in its begin
ning, with such athletes as the Mur
rays and "Ric" Templeton making names
for themselves. Here, as captain of the
soccer team, Boyle was first given rec
ognition as a leader, while he was also
a devotee of tennis and track.
In 1915, he was graduated from the
chemistry department. He. is a member
of Alpha Phi Sigma and Phi Lambda
Epsilon.
In 1916, with war clouds on the hori
zon, he took an examination for a com
mission in the army, and was appointed
a second lieutenant in 1917. Following
his appointment he took a course at the
army school at Fort Leavenworth, and
was then sent to Fort Bliss on the Mexi
can border.
While there, he was commissioned as
a first lieutenant. At Fort Sill, some

months later, Ik* took a course in aerial 1
observation, but after sixty hours in the
air, he decided that his original choice,
the artillery, was the most attractive of
the two, and so went back.
War was declared with Germany, and
as a member of the Fourth Division,
Boyle left Camp Greene, X. C., in May,
1918, en route for France. The trip to
Bordeaux was followed by a brief train
ing period, and then the division \va
plunged into the counter-offensive at
Chateau-Thierry. Lieutenant Boyle be
came Captain Boyle while at the front,
where he took part in the hot lighting !
at St. Mihiel and in the Argonne.
1 With the. signing of the armistice,
the Fourth Division was ordered into
Germany, encamping in the Moselle re- .
gion. Here Captain Boyle spent some
time before returning to the United
States, and was much impressed by the
( beauty of the region.
While taking advanced artillery work
at the. Army Artillery School at Camp
Dodge and at the Field Artillery School
at Camp Taylor, Captain Boyle asked to
be assigned to the R. O. T. C. detach
ment at Stanford, where he would be
in the old familiar surroundings and
where he could serve those students
who were attending his Alma Mater.
In September. 1920, he was ordered
here, and has been actively engaged in
the military instruction of the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps ever since.
Though he owns an automobile. Cap
tain Boyle gets his real fun from horse
back riding, particularly from polo at
which he is quite adept. He is married
and has settled down in Palo Alto.
In his own parlance, he "Likes the
service fine" and "intends to stick with
it."
