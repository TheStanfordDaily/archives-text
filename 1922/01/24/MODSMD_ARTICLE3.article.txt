# Keynote Dropped From Airs Makes Deep Impressions
## 
### 
Impressionism in musicâ€”that's the
latest. It will be offered for campus
approval for the first time on February
10, when Ram's Head Society presents
its annual show.

A contagion of cubism is raging on
the campus and campus song and mu
sic writers are among the epidemic's
heaviest sufferers. Among those who
have contributed airs are Myron Higby,
'22; Dick Malaby, '23; Charlie Midgley,
'23; Clarence Carey, '25; Lloyd How
ard, '21; Charlie Burgess, '23.

The music will be played by a twelve
piece Ram's Head orchestra under the
direction of Myron Higby.
