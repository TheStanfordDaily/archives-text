OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, Corvallis, Jan. 24 ( P. I. N. S.) â€”
Some students have found it necessary
to drop out because of lack of funds
but despite this fact there is a heavy
1 registration this term. Many students

will have to find work it they continue
at college this term. The Y. M. C. A.
is serving as an employment bureau and
townspeople or people in the surround
ing country who have work to be done
I are being urged to assist the students
by listing work. More demand than
I ever is being made on the student loan
I fund, which is practically exhausted. It
Jis hoped that persons generously in
j dined will see tit to contribute to the
! fund.
