The National Agricultural
1 Conference
In response ito the » invitation of
l ifcsidrnt Herding three hundred dele
gates from all parts of the country
have convened at Washington in a
National Agricultural Conference. The
farmers.of the country want to find
some method whereby speculation in
the price of food stuffs may be cur
tailed so that the farmers will get
enough of the ultimate price paid by
the consumer. They are therefore de
manding at this conference such things
as: lower freight rates; greater ere- !
dit facilities; the legislation of co- j
operative marketing.
The "Farmer Bloc"
The "Farmer Bloc" which has ap
peared in Congress has become so
powerful that the evolution of a new
"third party" is hoped for by some!
and feared by others. Of course, the |
"regulars" in both parties are opposed )
to any such development and Presi
dent Harding in his opening address
to the conference plainly told the
farmers that the settlement of their
problems is beyond the power of the
"Farmer Bloc."
A World of Conferences
Last Saturday Lloyd George voiced j
his approval of conferences as a hap-j
py method for solving world problems. I
Yesterday the Independent Liberals
in a meeting with Viscount Grey and
Herbert Asquith at their head, con
demned the practice as the cause of j
the fall of the recent Briand ministry
in France. Viscount Grey holds the ;
Supreme Allied Council responsible for I
the distrust and lack of confidence be
tween France and England.
Premier Poincare seems to agree
with the Independent Liberals of Eng
land, for he elected to submit his plan
for an Anglo-French alliance through
the old-time diplomatic channel. Yes
terday through the French Ambassa
dor at Londan he presented his pro
posal to Lord Curzon, the British Min
ister of Foreign Affairs.
The pact proposes a pledge of mu
tual aid in case of aggression, but j
France goes farther and asks that ]
ireat Britain state definitely how much !
and what kind of assistance she will!
give in case Germany attacks France, j
This Great Britain can hardly be ex- j
pected to do.
