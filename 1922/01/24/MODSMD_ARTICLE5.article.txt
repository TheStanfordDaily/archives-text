# Basic Course Men In Summer Camp Trip
## 
### 
With 25 per cent of the men enrolled
in the basic course in the Stanford
military unit entitled to make the an
nual trip to summer camp at Camp
Knox, Tennessee, as well as the men
in the advance course, who are re
quired to attend at least one summer
camp, competition among members of
the unit for the privilege of attend
ing bids fair to be keen as the work
in this and the coming quarter pro
gresses.
Men who began the course last quar
ter are now engaged in training in
eo.uitation, and as the theoretical work,
are learning the parts and construc
tion of the various types of the guns.
