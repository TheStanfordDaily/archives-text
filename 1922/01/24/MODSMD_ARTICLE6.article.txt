# PRESIDENT TELLS MINI OF NEED EH! ENDOWMENT
## Circular Letter Outlines Plan of Work and Opening of "First Million" Campaign 
### 
Nine thousand Stanford alumni will
be informed of the opening of "The
First Million for Stanford" campaign
through a letter which is being sent out
by President Wilbur today. A brief ex
planation of the financial condition of
the University and the general plan of
the campaign is contained in the lectter,
a copy of which follows:
January 23. 1922.
To the Men and Women of Stanford:
The climax of a succession of events
and of a condition which can no longer
be overlooked lias arrived. Since, 1913
it lias been increasingly obvious that the
resources of the University must be in
creased. The last two years have
brought a deficit of over $200,000 in
spite of tuition fees, which were de
signed to cover a small percentage of
the annual amount required.
We have not arrived at this hour
blindly but with a full realization of
the problems before us. It marks a
new era in the life of the University
and requires an intensified loyalty on
the part of every Stanford man and
woman. I feel that Stanford needs hut
to call and her sons and daughters will
answer.
My great regret is that I cannot sit
down with you for a personal and un
hurried conference. Since that is im
possible. I am planning, unless some
thing unforseen prevents, to meet you
with other Stanford men and women at
a time to be determined by the working
out of our organization for ''The First
Million For Stanford." We do not

propose a simultaneous movement even
on the. Pacific Coa>t. It lias been thought
wisest to begin at the center, at the Uni
versity itself, and work out step by step
from that point. You will soon be in
formed of the details of the plan.
We. cannot entertain a thought of fail
ure. Stanford's spirit lias carried the
University to victory after victory. The
greatest victories and the greatest
achievements art. ahead. We shall as
sume that we can count on you. When
the time arrives in which you can render
your biggest service we will ask you to
do it, without waste of time, without
lost motion and without unnecessary
sacrifice.
As President I ma\ be able, to inter
pret and explain to alumni who are
not close enough to see and feel the
evidences of progress. It will give me
pleasure to hear from you.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) R\v Lyman Wii.iuu.
President.
