# Year-Round Training Necessary For Football Men, Says Warner
## 
### 
Glenn Warner is leaving the campus
tonight for Los Angeles, where Ik- will
visit with his brother. No statement as
to his future activities in relation to
Stanford has been given out.
At a smoker given in his honor last
night in the Union by the Board of
Athletic Control, Warner told some of
his coaching experiences, and gave some
recommendations to the men of 1921
football squad. A football playe.r must
keep tit the year around, he said. No
man can come out on the field at the
beginning of the fall practice soft and
flabby, and expect to get into adequate
condition, as well as to learn the plays.
A player should keep himself in shape
between seasons by going out for some
other sport, Warner said.
Every man knows best what his per
sonal weaknesses are, and is himself
best able to correct them, during the
part of the year he. is not jnayrng foot
ball. A man who is slow should go out
for track events, those who arc clumsy
on their feet should take up tennis or
track events, a man who wants to prac

tice judging a ball should play base
ball. one who wants to develop in for
ward passing should take up the discus
or javelin, and so on. By this plan, said
Warner, a great deal of useless drilling
during the preliminary season is avoided.
Warner told of the "chicken ball"
trick, which he was the lirst to use with
his Carlisle Indian team. Indians are
very observant, lie said, tut their ig
norance of civilized conveniences leads
them to make many blunders at lirst.
The stoic character given to Indians is
false, as they all have a sense of humor
and enjoy a joke. As an example, War
ner told of one of his green players
who was led by his team-mates to put
olive oil on the bread served in the
diner in the belief that it was syrup; the
player then turned the tables by eating
the concoction without turning a hair.
Those who attended the smoker in
cluded members of the Board of Ath
letic Control, the Faculty Committee on
Athletics, the 1921 football team, and
the Department of Physical Education
for Men.
