# STANFORD FAVORED TO DEFEAT OREGON
## Cardinals Have Day's Rest Before First Conference Contest Tonight 
### 
Something like. 7(.X) miles away from
the Stanford campus, at Eugene, Ore
gon, the Cardinal varsity basketball
team will open its conference season
against the University of Oregon web
footers tonight.

Coach Gene Van Gent and his ten men
arrived rn the northern city last night.
With a whole day in which to recover
from the effects of the train journey,
the Stanford basket shooters should be
ready to go at top speed when they bat
tle with the lemon-yellow quintet.

According to the unreliable "dope,"
the Oregon game tonight should be lit
tle more than a good workout for Van

Gent's quintet, which ought to be re
turned the winner by ten points or
more. George Bohler's team has
dropped every conference game this
season. "Hec" Edmunson's Sundodgers
from Seattle ran riot with them in the
first game at Seattle, and the contest
ended with the web-footers on the
wrong end of a 76 to 15 score. The
Oregon Aggies downed them twice, and
Whitman College administered the same
medicine.
The Cardinals at the present time are
more or less of an enigma. If they
play as they did in their last game with
St. Ignatius, they will have difficulty in
defeating Oregon. But if they start in
where they left (iff after the Olympic
Club contest, they will win tonight's
game handily.
As a team, Bohler's proteges may not
rate very high, but one Beller, who plays
guard, is reported to be good enough for
any quintet on the coast. The Oregon
coach set Beller to watch Sielk, the six
and a half foot Washington center, in
the second game between Washington
and Oregon. What damage Sielk did
to the Oregon defense with Beller
guarding him was hardly worth speak
ing about.
Little Durno, the vest pocket size for
ward, who starred for the Oregon five
when it played Stanford here last year,
has completed his four years of inter
collegiate basketball. He landed a
coaching position at the Eugene insti
tution, and lias been helping Bolder
whip his team into shape.
Still farther north, the University of
California live won the opening game
of its northern invasion from Wash
ington State last night, although not by
so great a margin as was expected.
The final score was 21 to 15. and it was
due to the efforts of Talt and Eggleston
in the second half that the Bruins
emerged victors.
The probable line-up 'for tonight's
game at Eugene:
Stanford —Davies, McHose. forward;
Janssen, ccnter; Richmond, DeGroot,
guards.
Oregon—Andre, Rockhey. forwards;
Zimmerman, center; Beller. Edlund,
guards. .
