# MIDGETS TO PLAY REDWOOD TONIGHT
## Lightweight Squad Will Play First Game of 1922 Season as Opener to "Frosh" Bout 
### 
Stanford's lightweight team will play
the first game of its season tonight
against the Redwood City High School
130-pounde.rs. The game will be played
as a preliminary to the freshman contest.
After a week of intensive practice the
squad has been cut to fifteen. Twenty
men had to be dropped because of ex
cess weight of competition. W. W.
Young. '23, who coached the last suc
cessful season as well as playing running
guard, will repeat his performance this
year.
The probable line-up will start Sil
viera at standing guard; Young, run
ning guard; 1 logic, center; and Hol
lingsworth, Meyers or Kitou at for
ward. The tirst four mentioned played
these positions last year.
The Redwood City quintet is touted
as a strong team. Manager J. B. San
some, who arranged the game, says that
they will doubtless give the Cardinal
midgets a hard battle. The visitors will
have to be good, though, to overcome
the advantage the 130-pounders have in
being used to each other. All of last
year's team is back with the. exception
of Koba, and it is possible that he will
play tonight since the varsity is away.

The past week of practice has shown
the passing to he far better than the
scoring. The addition of Koba would
materially strengthen this department.
New uniforms will feature the first
appearance of the "little fellers" to
night. They will be clad in a gray jer
sey with a red band. The numerals 130
are sewed on the band.
The following may be introduced into
the game later: Blosser, Burnett, Gerry,
Hobra, Hugo, Kennedy, Sanford. '1 horn
ton. and Stevenson. These men, to
gether with those named before, form
the squad. The game has been sched
uled to start at 7:15.
