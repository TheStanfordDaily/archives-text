# CARDINAL VARSITY QUINTET WINS FIRST CONFERENCE CONTEST FROM UNIVERSITY OF OREGON FIVE, 32-29
## Last-Minute Rally of Lemon and Green Stopped Short; McHose Stars with Sixteen Points 
### 
EUGENE, Ore., Jan. 25. â€”Led by the diminutive forwards, McHose and
Davies, the Stanford varsity basketball quintet crashed through the Uni
versity of Oregon defense for a 32 to 29 victory, last night, and the CaV
dinals were off to a flying start in the Conference race.

A last-minute Lemon-Yellow rally was smothered by the Stanford ftve
man defense. The Cardinals made merry at the expense of the Oregon five
for three quarters of the contest, and were never on the short end of the
score.
Coach Bohler of Oregon used ten men in the desperate effort to stave
off defeat, but the Stanford attack was too fast. McHose and Davies were

the. stellar lights for the winners, while
Rockhey and Latham showed up best
for the Lemon-Yellow.
The first half ended with Stanford
leading, 18 to 16.
Van Gent's varsity basketball ma
chine, emerging partially from its rc
cent slump, and showing clearly the ef
fects of the northern trip, earned its
expected victory over Oregon last night
in its first Pacific Coast Conference
game.
It was a Stanford game from start
to finish despite the closeness of the.
score. Davies and Mcllose bore tlx?
blunt of the Cardinal attack, and tallied
all but four of the thirty-two points.
VAN GENT USES ONE SUB
Van Gent played his first-string line
up, and made but one change through
out the contest, sending in Howell at
center to relieve Janssen. The latter
came back in the second half, however,
and played the remainder of, the game.
The Oregonians experimented with
their quintet and shifted the players
considerably before, a satisfactory com
bination was found.
PREMIER M'HOSE
"Nip" McHose was the premier of the
Cardinal scoring cabinet, leading the
field with eight field goals to his credit.
The little forward shook off the jinx
which pursued him in the Olympic and
St. Ignatius contests, and tossed the
ball in the basket from all angles. Da
vies made four goals from field and
Janssen and Richmond one each.
The strange court held the Stanford
score down. Davies succeeded in con
verting but four of twelve free throws,
whereas the Cardinal skipper in pre
vious games has averaged ten out of
twelve.
Rockhey, who threw the fouls for the
Lemon-Yellow, fared better than Davies,
putting in five out of nine.
CARDINAL PLAY SUPERIOR
Van Gent's men forced the play
throughout the game, and Davies, Mc
llose and Janssen, with their short
passes, went through the comparatively
weak Oregon defense. The Cardinals
gained a big advantage by following up
their shots to the basket.
BRUINS LOSE
Marl Wight's Blue and Gold quintet
was forced to take bitter medicine from
Washington State, in their second con
ference contest at Pullman. The Bruins
apparently had the game won three min
utes from the final gun, only to be met
by a smashing rally which carried W.
S. C. to a 26 to 24 victory,
Wight's charges were enjoying a 21
to 10 lead at the end of the first half,
