# Helping a Help

One of the busiest centers in this busy life of ours
is the Women's Clubhouse—the tnecca for commit
tee meetings, the headquarters of student organiza
tions, the natural meeting place tor social functions,
the, rendezvous, of a week-end, for devotees of the
dance, both onlookers as well as active participants.
Upon consideration, where and what would we other
wise be without it?
lu a word the clubhouse is the concrete, outward
symbol of a multiplicity of every-day activity. There
is not an hour during the day in which it is not
performing service of some kind—not a person in
the University who has not made use of it at some
time, if not directly, then indirectly.
Notwithstanding a variety of demands, the build
ing is especially well equipped to meet all the needs
which it serves. There are committee rooms, social
rooms, kitchens, and music rooms, and its perfect
arrangement has entailed a debt which is being re
moved by various ways and means from time to
time.
One such experiment resulted last year in a con
tribution ol $146. which was made by the women at
the end of the year. I his sum was raised by the
simple process oi saving bookstore coupons, which
were deposited in boxes placed in various women's
living groups by U'onien's Conference.
A box for the same purpose has recently been most
conveniently placed at the front entrance of the
Mookstore. Nothing is more simple nor more worth
the cfiort than for everyone, instead of leaving pur
chase coupons to flutter in abandonment on the coun
ter, to deposit them in this box when leaving the
store, thereby benefitting himself, his neighbor, and
the Women's Clubhouse —a most deserving structure.
