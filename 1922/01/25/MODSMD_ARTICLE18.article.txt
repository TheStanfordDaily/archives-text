We believe this thing has gone far enough. It's time
to call a halt, if we want to get anywhere. Sarcasm,
irony, and all that, is all right in its place. But when
they spring an ex in Econ, no engineer has the right to
put up a sign saying "Are You Lucky?"

If a precedent is once laid down, there's no telling
what it will hatch out. Unless the crisis is met at
once, we may soon see such placards as: "What's An
Extra Ten Minutes." "Have a Smoke?" "Aren't Quizz
es Fun?"

The following letter was opened by mistake. If the
owner want it, he can call for it at the usual rates.
Dear Horace:
This has been a wonderful day. I am absolutely in
the clouds; my head is'still swimming. Gertie has ac
cepted me.
Stangely, today started just like any other day. Morn
ing came. Then evening. Ah, it was then that Gertie
called me up. She told me to come up to the house,
and of course I accepted. She said there was going to
be a bifj carpet laying.
Gertie met me at the door. She attempted to guide
me through the impressionistic lighting of the parlor,
but 1 made a bad impression. 1 stumbled against a
mahogany stand. This upset the goldfish greatly. My
groping hand next encountered a very thorny rose.
"Lovely flower." 1 muttered without thinking, "would
that you were mine."
Congratulate me, Horace.

Having fully emancipated the verse, we now present
nothing less than a poem.
Here It Is.
Whenever we're reading
of ine hero's proceeding
to rescue the queen of the land,
there's always some fellow,
comes up with a bellow,
and snatches the book from our hand.

We note with pride the progress the faculty section is
I making under the tutelage of our able assistant yell

A census of the peanut shells found after the game
| shows the faculty t'o have a comfortable lead with 193,-
! 862, exclusive of duds; this total is perhaps due to the
proximity of the bass horn. Second place goes to the
Women's Rooting Section, with 1999; third, press table.

The cops look awful nice in their new varsity arm
bands. They ought to be real proud to wear them. But
there are others who deserve recognition for their eff
forts in behalf of the Cardinal. We suggest the issuing
of a time-keeper's necklace. And these really should
be a ticket-taker's garter, in bright cardinal to repre
sent the sunset fires, you know.
