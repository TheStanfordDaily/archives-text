# LOCAL "Y" CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN POSTPONED
## 
### 
Although the Stanford V. M. C. A.
planned last quarter to conduct a cam
paign among the students on the cam
pus for funds for the local organization,
these plans have been laid aside for the.
present ,due to the fact that the "V"
feels there should be nothing in con- i
flict with the drive for "The First Mil- I
lion for Stanford." Ihe " campaign
was to have taken place the first week
in February, but by this action has been |
postponed indefinitely.
