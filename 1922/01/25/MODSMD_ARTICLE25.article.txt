The ordinary pray print will afford
much amusement to the amateur," he

putting the print in a copper solution,
a red tint is obtained and a gold bath
will turn the print a brownish red.
Several other rare sals will produce
varied color tints."
Pyro and M. Q. developers are used

arc operated makes them attractive
to the came man, he said.
