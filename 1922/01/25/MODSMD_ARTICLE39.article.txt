New German Treaty Planned

A new treaty between the United
States and Germany to create a coin
mission to settle the problems arising
0( tween the two countries as an after
math of the war, is being planned by
! Harding <uid Hughes. This is the al
ternative to going in with England,
France and Italy in the arbitration
commission established under the
treaty of Versailles. Hostility to any
thing connected with the Versailles
treaty, on the part of many senators,
has led to the suggestion outlined
above as the best alternative. This
commission would deal especially
with damage claims the United States
has against Germany.
Coal Prices May Rise
If the anthracite miners win their
demand for higher wages, the extra
cost of mining will be passed on to
the householder in the shape of a $1.10
boost per ton in the cost of egg, stove
and grate coal, according to an an
nouncement made by a committee of
anthracite operators. They claim
that they are still paying their em
ployees "war wages."
Genoa Still Hangs Fire
The United States will probably not
officially take part in the Genoa Econ
omic Conference, scheduled for March
8. This may cause the postponement
of the Conference, but if it is run off
according to schedule, the United
States will at least have an "observer"
present. The general opinion among
tfie officials at Washington seems to
be that until Europe climbs down from
her war basis and starts rehabilitation
in earnest, there is no use getting
tangled up in any economic meetings
with her. The senate irreconciliables
have to be considered, also, in order
that they may be kept from spoiling
Harding's plans resulting from the
Disarmament Conference.
Big Shipping Pool Forming
The $30,000,000 shipping pool being
formed on the Pacific Coast for the
purpose of rehabilitating shipping here
on a sound basis is taking definite
shape with the appointment of a com
mittee of prominent coast men who
will go east to confer at Washington
with Chairman Lasker, of the Shipping
Board.
