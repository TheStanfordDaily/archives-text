# SEAY MAKES SLASH IN DIAMOND SQUAD
## Green and Doughty on List of Injured; F. Tussing Releases Playing Schedule 
### 
Coach Seay lias cut his varsity dia
mond squad, reducing the prospects to
thirty-four men. Yesterday afternoon
several innings were run off, giving each
of the prospective heavers a chance to
warm up and get used to putting them
over. Â»
Johnny Couch is lining up a pitching
staff which bids fair to be of the caliber
which will bring home the bacon. Men
standing out at present as first-rate
slabsters are: Draper, Kelly, Xef, Low
enstein, Bonner, Green, and Clark. With
the season only beginning, it is likely
that more good material will be un
covered for the. mound.

If the number of candidates counts
for anything, the receiving end of the
Cardinal battery will be well taken care
of. In addition to Captain Green, who
is the strongest contestant for the po
sition, there are: Fuller, Holmes, Hol
ston, and Huneke. Fuller is the last
year's freshman catcher and Holmes and
Huneke gave him a hard run for. the
job until forced out of competition by
probation. Holston was on last year's
varsity squad and is able to handle the
receiving job in good fashion.
With the season's practice only two
weeks under way, the jinx has made
his appearance and two men have been
taken from the active list. Ray Doughty,
varsity football man, a good prospect
for an infield position on the diamond
squad, is in the hospital with a broken
jaw. During Monday afternoon's prac
ticc lie was hit by a pitched ball, break
ing his jaw on the right side.
Yesterday afternoon, Captain Green
threw his right knee out of place and.
although it is not known how badly it
was injured, lie will not lie in a uni
form for a week or so at the best.
