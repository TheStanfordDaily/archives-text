111 their lyric and delicate appeal, the
songs sung by Madame Helen Stanley
in her concert last evening formed a
program entirely of pastel shades. The
numbers presented an array of light,
colorful tints, the effect of which was
not disturbed by including any too
heavy or sombre compositions and the
artist herself, vocally delightful and
personally engaging, made this aspect of
the program the more enjoyable.
Madame Stanley's voice is decidedly
of the lyric type. It is clear, capable of
tinest shadings, and notable for beauty
of tone and range rather than dramatic
force. Her high, sustained notes were
particularly impressing, and case of
enunciation was another trait which
characterized the singer's work. '
The program emphasized most for
tunately these artistic abilities, and for
this reason could not have been better
adapted to Madame Stanley's individual
mode of interpretation. It was unique
in tliat il was made up of numbers un
familiar for the most partâ€”a delightful
selection of poetic songs from different
ages and nations.
The not-too-serious vein of her re
cital was introduced by the artist in the
first group of songs, which contained a
fanciful Italian piece, "Quando ti Re
vedro" by Donaudy, a French and a
British folk song, and "The Lark Xow
Leaves His Watery Xest" by Parker,
the latter being particularly well con
veyed.
Of the second group "The Silver
smith." a capricious little number, full
of melody and swing, was immediately
effective. Rachmaninow's "The Prayer"
was among the songs best bringing out
the clarity and control of the singer's
voiced as was also the following "Slum
ber Song," characterized by the beauty
of her high, perfectly sustained notes.
An Aria from "Conchita." closing the
group, was interesting in its imagination
and demands on range and tone qual
ities.
