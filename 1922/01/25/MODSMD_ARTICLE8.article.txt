# BABES WILL PLAY OAKLAND TECH FIVE
## Conquerors of Bear Freshmen Play Tonight on Long End of Dope; "Frosh" in Form 
### 
Oakland Technical High School will
meet the Stanford Freshman basketball
team tonight in the pavilion in what is
expected to be one of the hardest games
of the Babe schedule.
Coining to the campus vfith the scalp
of the California freshmen dangling at
their belts, the high school men hope to
add the Stanford Babe team to the list
of defeated teams. On the other hand,
Coach Seay's men are looking for an
opportunity to prove their worth against
a team that is equal in weight and speed,
and, if anything, even better according
to the "dope."
Dow, standing guard of the trans-bay
team, was last year chosen as all-star
guard of the O. A. L. He is a heady
player who is noted for his ability in
getting the ball out from under the bas
ket and back down the floor.
The Oakland team also boasts a pair
of speedy forwards. Improvement in
the playing of the Babe squad has been
rapid since the cut of last week. Coach
Seav has developed one team that is
able to work together with precision,
but outside of these live men there are
none who are very accurate. Alexander
and Hooper are playing better at for
ward than any other combination, and
they will probably start the game to
night. Oliva, at standing guard, and
Shipke at running guard, are both first
choice me.ii, although Houck and Wisely
play a good game.
It is at center that the most difficulty
is being experienced. Middleton. who
showed good form in this position at
the start of the season, has fallen into
a slump. Logan at times loses himself
in a.play, and his jump at center is not
as strong as is needed. Steele has
showed much improvement since the
first of the season, and is the logical
man to start tonight. He is fast and a
fair shot.
Coach Seay spent the entire practice
period last night in shooting baskets
from every angle, and in practice in
bringing the ball in from the side lines*.
Hoffman was out in uniform again
last night. He sprained his knee at the
beginning of the season and has been
011 the sick list since, but he will be. back
on the floor inside of a week. He and
Alexander developed an ability to work
together at the start of the season that
Hooper and Alexander cannot equal.
After Hoffman is in shape to play again,
Hooper will probably be returned to run
ning guard with Shipke in reserve.

Dow, standing guard of the trans-bay
team, was last year chosen as all-star
guard of the O. A. L. He is a heady
player who is noted for his ability in
getting the ball out from under the bas
ket and back down the floor.
The Oakland team also boasts a pair
of speedy forwards. Improvement in
the playing of the Babe squad has been
rapid since the cut of last week. Coach
Seav has developed one team that is
able to work together with precision,
but outside of these live men there are
none who are very accurate. Alexander
and Hooper are playing better at for
ward than any other combination, and
they will probably start the game to
night. Oliva, at standing guard, and
Shipke at running guard, are both first
choice me.ii, although Houck and Wisely
play a good game.
It is at center that the most difficulty
is being experienced. Middleton. who
showed good form in this position at
the start of the season, has fallen into
a slump. Logan at times loses himself
in a.play, and his jump at center is not
as strong as is needed. Steele has
showed much improvement since the
first of the season, and is the logical
man to start tonight. He is fast and a
fair shot.
Coach Seay spent the entire practice
period last night in shooting baskets
from every angle, and in practice in
bringing the ball in from the side lines*.
Hoffman was out in uniform again
last night. He sprained his knee at the
beginning of the season and has been
011 the sick list since, but he will be. back
on the floor inside of a week. He and
Alexander developed an ability to work
together at the start of the season that
Hooper and Alexander cannot equal.
After Hoffman is in shape to play again,
Hooper will probably be returned to run
ning guard with Shipke in reserve.
