# FIRE INSPECTOR LAMB ASKS FOR STUDENT CO-OPERATION
## 
### 
"To win the co-operation of the stu
de.nt body is half of the university's hat
tie for reform in fire protection," l'ire
Inspector Edward Lamb said today.
"The greatest danger comes from dirt
and filth which collects during the year
in the men's living groups and it is
only through the aid of the students
who live in these lire-traps that this can
be combated.
"Roble Hall is a model of cleanliness.
Madrona and the women's gymnasium
building, both frame structures, are
spick and span —good risks. The Wom
en's Clubhouse is extraordinarily neat.
Across from the Women's Clubhouse, is
the Men's Union and it is opposed to
the women's building just as much in
cleanliness as position.
"Encina Hall is a Class B building.
It is brick-walled, but all the floors are
on wooden joists and wooden laths sup
port the plaster. The stairs arc all of
wood. This alone is dangerous enough,
hut the closets under these stairs are
jammed with stores and one in par
ticular serves as. a rubbish bin.
"Besides this danger, there is that of
inadequate protection. To save a pos
sible loss of thousands of dollars in
plaster damage, the University had to
lock up the tirse hose they have about
the halls, so the men could not try to
drawn each other with them."
Inspector Lamb, who has a fourteen
year record with the San Francisco
Fire Department and as fire marshall
in the armv during the recent war.

is a Federal Board student in college.
He has lately been on tours of inspec
tion through the various living quar
ters and reports a bad condition from
rubbish. In one fraternity house he
mentioned finding two twenty-five-gal
lon kerosene cans stored in a clothes
closet right under the roof. In another
he stopped a man taking red hot ashes
in a wooden box.
"Now is the time.to start a fire pro
tection reform on the campus." Lamb
said. "llere is a $25,000,000 institution
carrying possibly $6,000,000 of insur
ance which the University had to pay
a dollar a hundred for if they pay a
cent. Fraternity houses and private
residences carry additional insurance.
"If we can convince the Board of
Underwriters that there is adequate tire,
i protection here, the rates will be re
duced. The department has been en
larged. When the old Cadillac is over
hauled and fitted as a chemical cart we
shall have a system which will be com
parable to a metropolitan system in ef
ficiency. The quarters arc to be en
larged and equipment is to he purchased
| for a crew of eight who will be avail
able at any time of the day or night.
We will be able to get out of the barns
in thirty seconds.
"Wc can only attain highest effi
ciency with the help of the student body.
Now is the time to make material con
tribution to the University's drive for
j more money by saving some in this di
rection."

is a Federal Board student in college.
He has lately been on tours of inspec
tion through the various living quar
ters and reports a bad condition from
rubbish. In one fraternity house he
mentioned finding two twenty-five-gal
lon kerosene cans stored in a clothes
closet right under the roof. In another
he stopped a man taking red hot ashes
in a wooden box.
"Now is the time.to start a fire pro
tection reform on the campus." Lamb
said. "llere is a $25,000,000 institution
carrying possibly $6,000,000 of insur
ance which the University had to pay
a dollar a hundred for if they pay a
cent. Fraternity houses and private
residences carry additional insurance.
"If we can convince the Board of
Underwriters that there is adequate tire,
i protection here, the rates will be re
duced. The department has been en
larged. When the old Cadillac is over
hauled and fitted as a chemical cart we
shall have a system which will be com
parable to a metropolitan system in ef
ficiency. The quarters arc to be en
larged and equipment is to he purchased

able at any time of the day or night.
We will be able to get out of the barns
in thirty seconds.
"Wc can only attain highest effi
ciency with the help of the student body.
Now is the time to make material con
tribution to the University's drive for
j more money by saving some in this di
rection."
"To win the co-operation of the stu
de.nt body is half of the university's hat
tie for reform in fire protection," l'ire
Inspector Edward Lamb said today.
"The greatest danger comes from dirt
and filth which collects during the year
in the men's living groups and it is
only through the aid of the students
who live in these lire-traps that this can
be combated.
"Roble Hall is a model of cleanliness.
Madrona and the women's gymnasium
building, both frame structures, are

Across from the Women's Clubhouse, is
the Men's Union and it is opposed to

cleanliness as position.
"Encina Hall is a Class B building.
It is brick-walled, but all the floors are
on wooden joists and wooden laths sup
port the plaster. The stairs arc all of
wood. This alone is dangerous enough,
hut the closets under these stairs are
jammed with stores and one in par
ticular serves as. a rubbish bin.
"Besides this danger, there is that of
inadequate protection. To save a pos

plaster damage, the University had to
lock up the tirse hose they have about
the halls, so the men could not try to
