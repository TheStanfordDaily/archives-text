Comptroller Roth will explain to the
"First Million" workers the exact needs
of the University, and answer questions
as to the disposition of the money to be
raised. Officers of the Endowment
Committee are to outline the method to
be followed throughout the country, and
tell of the progress of the work thus
far.
Following this group caucusses will
be held to decide on special methods
most convenient for the sections as
signed.
