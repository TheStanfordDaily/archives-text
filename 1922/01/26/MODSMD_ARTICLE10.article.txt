# VAN GENT MAY NOT RETURN AS FOOTBALL HEAD
## Stanford Head Coach Gets Three Attractive Offers From Mid-West Colleges 
### 
Coach Gene Van Gent may not re
turn to Stanford next year.
In a telegram to Walter Powell from
Eugene, Oregon, yesterday, Van Gent
intimated that he might accept one of
several attractive outside offers, and
would thus be unable to take the posi
tion as head coach here next year if it
were offered him. Powell issued the
following statement this morning:
"I received a telegram from Van Gent
yesterday from Eugene, in which he in
timated that he might not accept the
position as head coach at Stanford next
year if it is offered him. He has re
cently received three very attractive Of
fers of coaching positions, one of which
came from a well-known Western in
stitution. Van Gent was approached by
several directors and faculty men while
he was in the East during the Christ
mas holidays and asked to consider two
or three propositions in the Middle
West. It is known that three schools
—the University of Minnesota, North
western University, and Kansas Agri
cultural College—are looking for new
coaches and it is probable that the of
fers came from these schools. Van
Gent has refused to divulge at this time
what his decision will be."
In the single season lie has been at
Stanford, Van Gent lias won the ad
miration of both students and faculty.
He piloted the Stanford eleven through
a season last fall in which the team was
only defeated twice, welding together
his machine largely from new material.
Starting the present basketball season
with but two veterans from last year's
squad, Van Gent has built up a team
from new material which is at present
at the fore in the Pacific Coast Con
ference race. Should he decide to ac
cept a position which would prevent his
returning to Stanford next year, his
decision would lie received with genuine
regret.
Van Gent graduated from the I ni
versity of Wisconsin in 1914. lie was
said to be the greatest basketball player
ever developed i;i the Middle West, be
ing chosen all-Western center for three
successive year. As end. tackle, and
halfback, he displayed his versatility as
a football player. In the discus and
shot put, he became a track start in
his undergraduate days.
Since leaving college, he has spent
eight successful years coaching at va
rious institutions, lie coached at the
University of Missouri for two years
and at the University of Texas for the
same length of time. He was released
from his contract at Texas, to go into
business, on one condition —that he
would not coach in any other institution
in that section. Van Gent has been sim
ilarly popular in every school where he
has coached, and has an enviable repu
tation all over the country.
Van Gent's contract does not expire
at Stanford until September. 1922.

regret.
Van Gent graduated from the I ni
versity of Wisconsin in 1914. lie was
said to be the greatest basketball player
ever developed i;i the Middle West, be
ing chosen all-Western center for three
successive year. As end. tackle, and
halfback, he displayed his versatility as
a football player. In the discus and
shot put, he became a track start in
his undergraduate days.
Since leaving college, he has spent
eight successful years coaching at va
rious institutions, lie coached at the
University of Missouri for two years
and at the University of Texas for the
same length of time. He was released
from his contract at Texas, to go into
business, on one condition —that he
would not coach in any other institution
in that section. Van Gent has been sim
ilarly popular in every school where he
has coached, and has an enviable repu
tation all over the country.
Van Gent's contract does not expire
at Stanford until September. 1922.
Coach Gene Van Gent may not re
turn to Stanford next year.
In a telegram to Walter Powell from
Eugene, Oregon, yesterday, Van Gent
intimated that he might accept one of
several attractive outside offers, and
would thus be unable to take the posi
tion as head coach here next year if it
were offered him. Powell issued the
following statement this morning:
"I received a telegram from Van Gent
yesterday from Eugene, in which he in
timated that he might not accept the
position as head coach at Stanford next
year if it is offered him. He has re
cently received three very attractive Of
fers of coaching positions, one of which
came from a well-known Western in
stitution. Van Gent was approached by
several directors and faculty men while
he was in the East during the Christ
mas holidays and asked to consider two
or three propositions in the Middle
West. It is known that three schools
—the University of Minnesota, North
western University, and Kansas Agri
cultural College—are looking for new
coaches and it is probable that the of
fers came from these schools. Van
Gent has refused to divulge at this time
what his decision will be."
In the single season lie has been at
Stanford, Van Gent lias won the ad
miration of both students and faculty.
He piloted the Stanford eleven through
a season last fall in which the team was
only defeated twice, welding together
his machine largely from new material.
Starting the present basketball season
with but two veterans from last year's
squad, Van Gent has built up a team
from new material which is at present
at the fore in the Pacific Coast Con
ference race. Should he decide to ac
cept a position which would prevent his
returning to Stanford next year, his
decision would lie received with genuine
regret.
