# OAKLAND TECH IS DOWNED BY BABES
## High School Court Team Falls Before Babes 27-12, Freshmen Strong on Defensive 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay's freshman basket
hall team defeated the team from Oak
land Technical High School, 27-12, in
the pavilion last night.
Playing a steady game from whistle
to gun for the first time, the Babe team
was always on the long end of the score,
in spite of numerous substitutions by
the high school coach in an effort to
find a winning combination. Long shots
from the center of the floor by Shipke.
and Hooper netted many of the points
made by the freshmen.
Inaccuracy in shooting baskets was
the weak point of the game, neither of
the forwards being able to score con
sistently.
The high school men looked danger-
ous only in the lirst quarter. Alexan- |
der scored the first tally of the game
on a foul shot. He was closely fol
lowed by Hooper, who tossed a field
goal after a pretty pass from Steele.
Church, playing forward on the prep
team, shot the next basket from the
side of the court. He was followed by
Hooper for the freshmen and Fletcher
for the high school team. Diehl scored |
a foul shot, making the score 5-5 at the '
end of the quarter.
From then on the trans-bay team lust
ground steadily, largely as the result of
the close guarding of Shipke, Steele and
Oliva. It was on the defense that,the
freshmen appeared to best advantage.
The half ended with the Babes on the
long end olga 10-7 tally. In the second
half, the basket-shooting of the for- j
wards became more accurate, with i
Hooper and Alexander scoring live field
goals during this period.
Shipke was the surprise of the game.
Two long shots from center court, and
an overhead shot from under the bas
ket was his contribution to the score.
Although he lias never played as run
ning guard before, he. has succeeded in
learning the requirements of the position
fairly well.
Steele, at center, failed to break into
the scoring column, but his accurate
passes to the forwards made many of
the scores possible. Steele also showed
better on defense than offense.
Oliva. at standing guard, was mainly
responsible for the low score made by
the Oakland team. He and Shipke
broke up most of the plays of the high
school team, forcing them to long shots
from center and side.
Diehl was the outstanding player for
the Oakland team, but most of his shots
were smothered by close guarding.
The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford —Alexander. Hooper, for
wards; Steele, center; Shipke, Oliva,
guards. Substitutions; Middleton, cen
ter; Widely, guard.
Oakland Tech. —Diehl. Church, for
wards; Fletcher, center; Warner, Cowes,

team, shot the next basket from the
side of the court. He was followed by
Hooper for the freshmen and Fletcher
for the high school team. Diehl scored |
a foul shot, making the score 5-5 at the '
end of the quarter.
From then on the trans-bay team lust
ground steadily, largely as the result of
the close guarding of Shipke, Steele and
Oliva. It was on the defense that,the
freshmen appeared to best advantage.
The half ended with the Babes on the
long end olga 10-7 tally. In the second
half, the basket-shooting of the for- j
wards became more accurate, with i
Hooper and Alexander scoring live field
goals during this period.
Shipke was the surprise of the game.
Two long shots from center court, and
an overhead shot from under the bas
ket was his contribution to the score.
Although he lias never played as run
ning guard before, he. has succeeded in
learning the requirements of the position
fairly well.
Steele, at center, failed to break into
the scoring column, but his accurate
passes to the forwards made many of
the scores possible. Steele also showed
better on defense than offense.
Oliva. at standing guard, was mainly
responsible for the low score made by
the Oakland team. He and Shipke
broke up most of the plays of the high
school team, forcing them to long shots
from center and side.
Diehl was the outstanding player for
the Oakland team, but most of his shots
were smothered by close guarding.
The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford —Alexander. Hooper, for
wards; Steele, center; Shipke, Oliva,
guards. Substitutions; Middleton, cen
ter; Widely, guard.
Oakland Tech. —Diehl. Church, for
wards; Fletcher, center; Warner, Cowes,
guards. Substitutions; Pratt. Potter,
Davis, forwards.

Coach Duffy Seay's freshman basket
hall team defeated the team from Oak
land Technical High School, 27-12, in
the pavilion last night.
Playing a steady game from whistle
to gun for the first time, the Babe team
was always on the long end of the score,
in spite of numerous substitutions by
the high school coach in an effort to
find a winning combination. Long shots
from the center of the floor by Shipke.
and Hooper netted many of the points
made by the freshmen.
Inaccuracy in shooting baskets was
the weak point of the game, neither of
the forwards being able to score con
sistently.
The high school men looked danger-
ous only in the lirst quarter. Alexan- |
der scored the first tally of the game
on a foul shot. He was closely fol
lowed by Hooper, who tossed a field
goal after a pretty pass from Steele.
Church, playing forward on the prep
team, shot the next basket from the
side of the court. He was followed by
Hooper for the freshmen and Fletcher
for the high school team. Diehl scored |
