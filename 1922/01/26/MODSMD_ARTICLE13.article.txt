# FRESHMAN BASEBALL SQUAD CUT TO TWENTY
## 
### 
Freshman baseball coach Kallam,
I made the first cut in his squad yester
day afternoon, reducing it to twenty
j men.
With the first yearling game only
; three weeks away, Kallam is working
j his protegees hard every day and is
gradually getting them lined up for
the right positions. The infield of the
freshman lot has been stripped of
turf and now has more of the appear
ance of a regular baseball field.
Kallam is counting strong on his
infield material, but the candidates for
the center garden positions do not
look so promising. There are now an
even half dozen men in the race for
mound positions and the yearling
mentor is expecting to be strong in
this department.
After the freshmen get under way,
i several games will be scheduled with
j the varsity niri-j to take the plb.ee of
regular practice.
Men who are still on Kallam's list
are: Catchers, Johnson, J. Lawson.
Connor, Reichsmith; pitchers, Solo
j mon, Follingsbee, Grey. Howard, Ayde
i lotte, Teague; inflelders, McDonald,
j Cuddebach, McCandless, Mulchay,
i Roberts. Toner; outfielders, Krogness,
| Brown, Chamberlain, R. Lawson.
