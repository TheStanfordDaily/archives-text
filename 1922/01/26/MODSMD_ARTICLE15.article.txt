tonight, 23 to 21, in what is said to have been the best basketball game
played at Oregon this season. Cardinal lead never seriously threatened.

A badly battered University of Ore
gon basketball five was unable to re
sist the onslaught of the last Cardinal
quintet last night, and Stanford, with
two games won, is now tied with Wash
ington at the top of the Conference
ladder.
It was the eighth straight conference
contest the Webfooters have lost.
Another Final Rally
The contestants saved all the thrills
for the final moments of the game-
Stanford jumped into the lead early,
and although the score at half time
was 9 to 8, Van Gent's hopefuls pulled
away. from the weak lemon-Yellow
team in the final period. Six minutes
before the final gun, they were lead
ing, 21 to 16
Things began to happen at this po
int of the ba't'r. The Oregonians took
on a new lease of !ii'«?, and dropped in
two baskets, making the score 21 to
19. For four minutes the teams fought
desperately for the deciding points.
Bib Bob Janssen, Cardinal center, who
up to this time had gone scoreless,
placed the ball through the hoops and
won the game for Stanford.
Stanford Team Work Wins
The better-trained Cardinal quintet,
with its team work and short passing
had many shots at the basket, but miss
ed quite a number of them. Davies
took advantage of most of the fouls
called on the Web-footers, convert
ing three out of five tries.
"Nip" McHose duplicated his spec
tacular play of the evening before. He
was practically impossible to stop, and
he broke through the Oregon defense
for six field goals. Andre of Oregon
finished next to him in the matter of
points scored, contributing eight to
his team's total.
Conference Standings
Stanford by virtue of her two wins
and no defeats, is at the top of the
percentage column. The University
of Washington, however, is the real
leader with eight victories.

Cardinals Play Aggies
Van Gent's machine will meet stiffer
competition according to the "dope"
when they take 011 the Oregon Aggies
o.t Corvallis next Friday and Satur
day nights. The Aggies have two
wins over Ore®on to their credit.
The general opinion of basketball
followers here is that the Cardinals
will have to take a brace when they
play the Oggies if they are to be re
turned the winners. The small margin
ot the Stanford victories over the
weak Oregon teams has reduced the
duced the Stanford quintet to a team
of doubtf'ri ability. On the basis of
comparative scores, the Lemon-Yellow
games ought to have been rather easy
'or the Cardinals. The Oregon five
may have improved since its deieat
by the University of Washington, and
may be a stronger aegregation than is
generally supposed here.
