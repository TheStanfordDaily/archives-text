He is just an ordinary two-fisted Irish-American.
He claims lie doesn't know much of the learning that
is obtained from books and five-hour lecture courses,
but there is one thing that he does know, and that is
fire. Fires, according to his interpretation mean fire
prevention and fire-fighting. He is proud that he has
done work in both lines, but most of his experience
has been with the latter. That is why lie is so enthu
siastic about fire prevention. And his enthusiasm is
contagious.
Just talk for a few minutes with Eddie Lamb, newly
appointed fire inspector, and you will begin to think
that Stanford has been very lucky in the matter of
conflagrations. Lamb is not superstitious, but he
believes that luck, or whatever it is that has guided
our destinies in the past, will not always be so watch
ful over us, and he is starting a campaign to make
the campus untenable for fires.
Recently the University invested several thousand
dollars in a modern fire-fighting truck, it is Lamb's
ambition to keep this machine new by not using it.
He advances several reasons why fires should be
prevented.
It is not so much a question of a money loss, for
most of the buildings of the University are insured.
But, if a fire were to start in one of the halls, a fra
ternity, or a sorority house, and it were completely

many students in Stanford today would lie able to
continue in college if all of their books, clothes, and
other belongings gathered during their stay were de
stroyed? Some of them would be able to start anew,
but many would have to drop out of college for a
quarter or more to refurnish themselves and to
recoup their losses.
A survey of the buildings of the University, in
cluding living quarters, reveals the fact that there are
but four buildings used as living quarters that an
insurance company would classify as first-class risks.
All of the others have, in some part of them, a room
or closet which is a depository for all of the rubbish,
papers, and other combustibles which collect from
month to month and make fire traps of the dwell
ings. Jn words, we are like the small boy who
plays with watches, although he knows he shouldn't,
in that we are deliberately inviting fires.
J lie first step in fire prevention, according to Lamb,
is to get rid of this rubbish and filth which lias col
lected, and the second is to keep rid of it. i lie Uni
versity has provided adequate protection from fires,
but it is up to each living group and every individual
of each group to furnish lire prevention.
It is a matter of self-preservation primarily, and
as the new firechief puts it, "An ounce of fire preven
tion is worth several thousand gallons of water and
chemicals and often times saves many lives and much
personal and real property.
A day probably will be set in the next few days for
a general clean-up of the campus. Wagons will be
provided to carry all the rubbish to the scene of the
bonfire, where it will be deposited as a base for next
year's pyre. . .
In the meantime, cultivate the new chief it you
want to meet a character and a man who is an expert
in his own line.

Just talk for a few minutes with Eddie Lamb, newly
appointed fire inspector, and you will begin to think
that Stanford has been very lucky in the matter of
conflagrations. Lamb is not superstitious, but he
believes that luck, or whatever it is that has guided
our destinies in the past, will not always be so watch
ful over us, and he is starting a campaign to make
the campus untenable for fires.
Recently the University invested several thousand
dollars in a modern fire-fighting truck, it is Lamb's
ambition to keep this machine new by not using it.
He advances several reasons why fires should be
prevented.
It is not so much a question of a money loss, for
most of the buildings of the University are insured.

many students in Stanford today would lie able to
continue in college if all of their books, clothes, and
other belongings gathered during their stay were de
stroyed? Some of them would be able to start anew,
but many would have to drop out of college for a
quarter or more to refurnish themselves and to
recoup their losses.
A survey of the buildings of the University, in
cluding living quarters, reveals the fact that there are
but four buildings used as living quarters that an
insurance company would classify as first-class risks.
All of the others have, in some part of them, a room
or closet which is a depository for all of the rubbish,
papers, and other combustibles which collect from
month to month and make fire traps of the dwell
ings. Jn words, we are like the small boy who
plays with watches, although he knows he shouldn't,
in that we are deliberately inviting fires.
J lie first step in fire prevention, according to Lamb,
is to get rid of this rubbish and filth which lias col
lected, and the second is to keep rid of it. i lie Uni
versity has provided adequate protection from fires,
but it is up to each living group and every individual
of each group to furnish lire prevention.
It is a matter of self-preservation primarily, and
as the new firechief puts it, "An ounce of fire preven
tion is worth several thousand gallons of water and
chemicals and often times saves many lives and much
personal and real property.
A day probably will be set in the next few days for
a general clean-up of the campus. Wagons will be
provided to carry all the rubbish to the scene of the
bonfire, where it will be deposited as a base for next
