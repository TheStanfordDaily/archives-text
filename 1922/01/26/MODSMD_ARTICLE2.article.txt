# LIGHTWEIGHTS TAKE OPENING GAME FROM SEQUOIA HIGH, 20-9
## 
### 
Redwood City High's 130-pound quin
tet lost to the Cardinal Lightweights
last night, 20-9. The contest was close
and fast, and the victory was the re
sult of brilliant individual playing rather
than extraordinary teamwork. It was
the first work Qf the season for the
midgets.
Just before the team took the floor,
Joe Silviera, standing guard, was elect
ed captain, lie played his usual steady
game.
All of the invaders' baskets were
from long shots. There never was a
time that the defense let down long
enough for a rally and the local light
weights always kept the lead. It was
not until Kitou tossed the ball up into
the wires supporting the backboard,
from which it joggled through the hoop
after rolling around aloft, that it be
came evident that there would be no
rally. Luck like that was never beaten.
Young, coach and running guard for
the Stanfordites, was the star of the
evening. Ten points are credited to his
favor. Out of eight tries at free throws
be converted six times. Besides this,
Young sunk two field goals and played
a good guard all through the game.
Torres, Redwood forward, was the
most dangerous man on the visiting
team. He was responsible for half their
scoring and guarded better tlian any of
his team-mates. In general, the visi
tors were superior in teamwork but
could not stand up before the. fierceness
of the Cardinal attack.
Passing seems to be the feature of the
lightweight's game which Coach Young
will have to worry about most. Lob
shots were again and again intercepted.
With this defect remedied and Koba
back in his old position to strengthen
the scoring end, the speed and fight of
the midgets will make them likely win
ners of the P. A. A. tournaments which
Manager J. B. Sansone is arranging for
them.
The lineup was as follows:
Stanford — Meyer, Kitou, forwards;
Hogle, center: Young. Silviera. guards.
Redwood — Jones, Torres, forwards;
Parsons, center; Thompson, Mitchell,
guards.
Substitutions: Sanford for Hogle;
Hugo for Young; Hollingsworth for
Kitou; Blosser for Young.
