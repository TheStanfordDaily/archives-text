Dear Head of Cabbage:—The Engineering Stairs get
as much publicity as the people who pass up them; we
are always hearing about the Ldw Stairs; the English-
Econ Stairs advertise themselves on more than Roughs'
Day; but it looks as if it's up to poor old Thursday to
remind the campus of the stairs in front of the Romance
Languages Department, which, considering the romantic
language oft spoken thereon, might be named "The
Romance Stairs." To sing their praise Ye Cabbage must
after several weeks' absense, return to,verse:
The Co-Ed speaks:

THE ROMANCE STAIRS
Oh, seven-stairs for men in law,
Such seven, sacred stairs!
You can not pass, they tell each lass —
- -They cheer the one that dares!
The Law men say we are allowed
Nine English-Econ stairs,
But who'd push thru that smoking crew?
It frowns, "Go anywheres!"
The Engineers' invite a girl,
But they're five big-eyed stairs;
If you don't mind, I'm not that kind.
I will avoid the glares.
Subtracting seven, five and nine.
We've only left six stairs,
But oh, how good; adore we should
The path Milady fares..
Law, Econ, Engineer men keep.
Oh, keep your favorite lairs,
For no man's mean; they'll even queen
Upon my Romance Stairs.
Poor Cinderella's carrot is
A carriage unawares;
If you'd be prince, come, sit with me,
Upon my Romance Stairs.

As Shakespeare said, "What's in a senior record?" A
man who has won more points for Stanford on the
cinder path than ever a Phi Bete rolled up in a bawl
out may, out of modesty, simply put "track" after his
name, while another individual not conspicuous on Wed
nesday or any other day will dish out a mixture of Ta
gawa Hash and Sticky Sundae strung together with a
bound of numerals resembling a quarterback in a de
lirium. Something like this: (were it annotated)

The wily Wylie should make 1923 Quad senior records
worth reading. The stereotyped form is a joke. Let's
get Renovation, Resuscitation and Rejuvenation. What
could be better than printing a clipping about each seni
or taken from the home-town paper? A few samples:

Mainville (Mo.) World: —
Luther Calvin Knox, eldest son of Parson Knox
of Mainville's First Assembled Church, gradu
ates this spring from Stanford, where he has
made an enviable record, both in esteem of
faculty and students. As a fitting testimonial
to his ability, he was last week appointed
Senior Usher in the Memorial Church. While
Luther, with characteristic modesty, did not
explain in detail the full significance of the
honor, we are sure that this highest of positions
v is not to be attained until one has first been
Junior Warden, Sub-Deacon and Sunday School
Superintendent.

Sebastion (Cal.) Sentinel: —
Miss Mary Annabelle Chrysanthemonia Sparks,
known to the residents of this city better as
Mary Ann, graduates this summer from Stanford
University, where she has been a leader in so
ciety. She has poured tea for many a young
millionaire and her name has been mentioned
no end of times in the "On 'n Off Society"
column of the student newspaper. Last spring
the prettiest girls in the college competed for
Queen of the May, and although there are only
2700 students, Mary Ann received 1357 votes.

Slocum (Utah) Herald: —
Charles Silas Peters, son of Si Peters with the
hardware store two doors on your right on Main
street this side of the Grand Union Depot, who
is offering a choice assortment of utensils for
spring gardening in another column, will gradu
ate this June from Stanford, where he has made
a great name for himself. Not only do we re
ceive this intelligence from his fond parents,
whose words the cynical are wont to discard oil
the score of over-fondness, but we are advised
by our honored contemporary, the editor of the
"Mayfield Marigold," that young Peters is well
known in his section and Mayfield is somewhere
south of Encina, not over two miles. Peters,
we understand, did not star in the big football
game with the state institution because Coach
Jean van Gehnt was saving his best meft for the
Passedena game a few weeks later. Readers of
our advertising columns know the splendid
record of the senior Peters for right-prices and
fair dealing and realize that his son could not
but have been the most illuminated luminary
of his university.

VERILY, A STUDENT IS NOT WITHOUT HONOR
