# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM STILL LEADS LEAGUE
## 
### 
Part of the fight that the Olympic
Club was putting up against Stanford
in the race for the Championship of
the University and Club Soccer League
lost its force when the Italian Sport
ing Union sprung a surprise and tied
the Club men 1-1 in a hotly contested
game last Saturday. The Italian ag
gregation was not figured as a strong
team, and the Winged "O" men got a
little careless. Luck was with the Ita
lians and this combined with the fact
that they are showing a better brand
of football gave them an advantage
for which the Olympics were not pre
pared.
Th<? fact that the Olympics were tied
increases the Cardinal hold 011 the
leadership of the league by one point.
The Olympic men let their opportuni
ty slip when they allowed this team to
tie them, as their hope for the cham
pionship of the league is now made
doubly difficult. Stanford may now
lose any game but the one to the
Olympic Club and still retain the lead
in the league. If Maloney's hopefuls
lose this game they will tie the San
Franciscans. It remains, however,
that Stanford now leads by a compara
tively safe margin, and from the pros
pects of last Saturday's game has a
team! that is a world-beater.

Stanford has four more games to be
played in the coming schedule. The
Cardinals meet the Olympics a week
from Saturday.
The American Legion Post, No. 52,
went down to defeat at the hands of
the Italian Virtus Cdub, losing the
game 1-2. This was quite as unexpect
ed as the U. S. I team tieing the Club
men.
California had no game over the
week-end, but from prospects it- looks
as though their soccer team will have
to be content with third place in the
league. It meets the U. S. I. team next
Saturday.
