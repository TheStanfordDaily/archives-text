# OLD "COLLEGE BELL" IS UNEARTHED AFTER SEARCH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
## 
### 
Berkeley, Cal., Jan. 26. (P. I. N. S.) â€”
As a result of several weeks' exhaust
ing search, led by Professor J. D.
Burks, '93, the old bell which in the
far past used to ring between classes
at the University of California has
been exhumed from forgotten dust and
was once more installed as a campus
institution at a rally held in its honor.
The new place of the historic old
bell, cast in Sheffield. England, in 1858
and forgotten from its insecure hang
ing place in North hall in 1910, will
be honorary and its reinstallation will
be for the purpose of connecting the
campus with fifty years ago with the
short skirts of today.
