# MANAGER RELEASES VARSITY AND BABE TRACK SCHEDULES
## 
### 
Graduate Manager Fletcher has re
leased both varsity and freshman track
schedules for the 1922 season which
starts with the Irish Marathon, on
March 4.
The Stanford-California freshman
track meet, to be staged on the Stan
ford Oval, will be held on April 8, the
date on which it was originally sched
uled, and not on April 15, the date
chosen later to give the Cardinal year
lings more time to get in shape after
spring vacation. The date of April 15
conflicted with one of California's var
sity dates, and it was therefore de
cided to change back to April 8.
Although not definitely decided up
on, it is planned to send a Cardinal

; team east next spring to compete in
' the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet to be
| held in Philadelphia, on May 27.
