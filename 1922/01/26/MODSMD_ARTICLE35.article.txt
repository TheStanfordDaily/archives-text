# EUPHRONIA WINS SALES TAX DEBATE FROM NESTORIANS
## 2-1 Decision Gives Negative Victory; Binkley, Landels and Fendler are Winners 
### 
Euphronia debaters, by greater ex
perience and polish of delivery, won
from Nestoria by a 2 to 1 decision for
the negative, in the yearly inter-society
contest last night in th# Little The
ater, on the question "Resolved, that
the Federal Government should levy
a tax on all manufacturers' sales."
Ten-minute speeches were given,
with four-minute rebuttals from each
man. Professor L. E. Bassett, head
of the division of Public Speaking,
Professor A. M. Cathcart, of the Law
School, and R. S. Scott, of the Public
Speaking Division, acted as judges.
Professor S. S. Seward of the Eng
lish Department, was chairman of the
debate.
H. W. Dryden, opening the affirma
tive side for Nestoria, pointed out that
similar sales tax systems are operat
ing very successfully in Canada and
the Philippine Islands, where condi
tions are essentially the same, and
should therefore replace the worn-out
tax laws now being used. The sales
tax, he said is easy to operate, and
would increase the revenue of the
country materially, although it would
not be necessary to do away with the
present income and excess profits law.
Opening Euphronia's negative argu
ment, Horald Fendler asserted that a
tax must not only be able to produce
ample revenue, but must be able to do
so without a complicated method of
collection. The sales tax, lie said, while
ostensibly a single law, will by its scale
of tax adjustments, have the claims of
an innumerable number of manufactur
ers of various commodities from stereo
scopes to suspenders clamoring for ad
justment of rates; and there would be
fhe further complication of what really
constitutes a sale—one of the most com
plex problems of present-day law.
Bertrand Comparet. whose cool and
forceful delivery in the second speech
for the affirmative made him Nestoria's
best speaker, outlined the plan of the
affirmative. Instead <?f forty-one taxes
with separate departments collecting
from twenty-three industries, the sales
tax proposed a single system by which
the taxes on 284 industries would be
under one head, with the rates tixed on
a scale whicji would reduce to a mini
mum the tax on necessities, while ob
taining a good revenue from luxuries.
E. D. Landels of Euphronia declared
that the function of a tax was not only
to get money easily, but to have a re
gard for the social consequences. The
sales tax on the consumer, and leaving
the large producer free, continues the
dangerous concentration of wealth and
lowers the standards of living.
Leland Stanford made the point in the
final Nestoria arguments that the sales
tax would put a tax on inefficiency. The
monopolies of the country today, he as
serted. arise because of their control of
one element in the production of a com
modity; the sales tax would eliminate
the profiteering middleman, and estab
lish a stable and efficient system with
each man manufacturing his whole prod
uct in competition with others.
Euphronia's most effective and polished
talk was made by R. C. Rinklev, who
closed the arguments for the negative,
lie said that the tax on manufacturers
sets up an artificial discrimination against
small producers. The policy of large
combinations of capital which has al
ways been fought vigorously by Ameri
can statesmen, he added, would by this
tax become recognized as a principle of
the. United States government.
Euphronia. by repeating her victory
of last year in this event, has won the
right to represent Stanford in the Col
lege Debating Society League, and will
meet the A. P. G. U. Society from St.
Marv's who last week defeated Congres
of California, as the next contest in the
league schedule.

ers of various commodities from stereo
scopes to suspenders clamoring for ad
justment of rates; and there would be
fhe further complication of what really
constitutes a sale—one of the most com
plex problems of present-day law.
Bertrand Comparet. whose cool and
forceful delivery in the second speech
for the affirmative made him Nestoria's
best speaker, outlined the plan of the
affirmative. Instead <?f forty-one taxes
with separate departments collecting
from twenty-three industries, the sales
tax proposed a single system by which
the taxes on 284 industries would be
under one head, with the rates tixed on
a scale whicji would reduce to a mini
mum the tax on necessities, while ob
taining a good revenue from luxuries.
E. D. Landels of Euphronia declared
that the function of a tax was not only
to get money easily, but to have a re
gard for the social consequences. The
sales tax on the consumer, and leaving
the large producer free, continues the
dangerous concentration of wealth and
lowers the standards of living.
Leland Stanford made the point in the
final Nestoria arguments that the sales
tax would put a tax on inefficiency. The
monopolies of the country today, he as
serted. arise because of their control of
one element in the production of a com
modity; the sales tax would eliminate
the profiteering middleman, and estab
lish a stable and efficient system with
each man manufacturing his whole prod
uct in competition with others.
Euphronia's most effective and polished
talk was made by R. C. Rinklev, who
closed the arguments for the negative,
lie said that the tax on manufacturers
sets up an artificial discrimination against
small producers. The policy of large
combinations of capital which has al
ways been fought vigorously by Ameri
can statesmen, he added, would by this
tax become recognized as a principle of
the. United States government.
Euphronia. by repeating her victory
of last year in this event, has won the
right to represent Stanford in the Col
lege Debating Society League, and will
meet the A. P. G. U. Society from St.
Marv's who last week defeated Congres
of California, as the next contest in the
league schedule.
Euphronia debaters, by greater ex
perience and polish of delivery, won
from Nestoria by a 2 to 1 decision for
the negative, in the yearly inter-society
contest last night in th# Little The
ater, on the question "Resolved, that
the Federal Government should levy
a tax on all manufacturers' sales."
Ten-minute speeches were given,
with four-minute rebuttals from each
man. Professor L. E. Bassett, head
of the division of Public Speaking,
Professor A. M. Cathcart, of the Law
School, and R. S. Scott, of the Public
Speaking Division, acted as judges.
Professor S. S. Seward of the Eng
lish Department, was chairman of the
debate.
H. W. Dryden, opening the affirma
tive side for Nestoria, pointed out that
similar sales tax systems are operat
ing very successfully in Canada and
the Philippine Islands, where condi
tions are essentially the same, and
should therefore replace the worn-out
tax laws now being used. The sales
tax, he said is easy to operate, and
would increase the revenue of the
country materially, although it would
not be necessary to do away with the
present income and excess profits law.
Opening Euphronia's negative argu
ment, Horald Fendler asserted that a
tax must not only be able to produce
ample revenue, but must be able to do
so without a complicated method of
collection. The sales tax, lie said, while
ostensibly a single law, will by its scale
of tax adjustments, have the claims of
an innumerable number of manufactur
ers of various commodities from stereo
scopes to suspenders clamoring for ad
justment of rates; and there would be
fhe further complication of what really
constitutes a sale—one of the most com
plex problems of present-day law.
