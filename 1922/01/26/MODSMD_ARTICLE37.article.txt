## DEMOCRATS LAUNCH ATTACK AGAINST GOVERNMENT. 
### (Edited by the History Club 
At last the Democratic leaders have
broken their long silence and have come
out in opposition of the policies of the
Republican government. At a Jackson
Day banquet in Dayton, Ohio, which
was attended by a number of Demo
cratic leaders, former governor Cox de
clared that he intended to take the
stump in the coming state elections. In
criticising the four-power agreement he
said, "It creates a group of nations and
theirs may encourage the establishment
of other groups. It might imply aggres
sion to other nations and they, in that
concept, might organize." This is ob
viously the weakest spot in the four
power pact and it is surprising that the
Democratic leaders have so long re
mained silent.
Cox still affirms the Democratic stand
for the League of Nations and praises
the Wilsonian policies. "No one. will
deny," he declared, "that if America
were now in the league tiiere would be
no need of any agreements between the
four powers in question."
Following the usual course of leaders
of the party out of power, Cox be
wailed the depressed condition of busi
ness which naturally lie attributed to
Republican management.
