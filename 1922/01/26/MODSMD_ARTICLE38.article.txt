# RULES FOR FUTURE WARS TO BE ESTABLISHED
## 
### 
Ii has been decided at the Washing
ton Conference to hold a five-power
conference on rules for the use of mod
ern agencies of warfare. It will prob
ably be held at The Hague and will be
callyd by the United States. It will be
the meeting of a commission of techni
cal experts and will endeavor to set
forth rules for the use of poison*gas,
aeroplanes, Submarines, and other mod
ern means of warfare in order to make
war as humane as possible. This is, no
doubt, a laudable ambition, be we re
call that similar rules were formulated
at The Hague tribunal before the Great
War and promptly forgotten as soon as
the pressure of actual war was felt. It
seems that a state will use about any
means that it can find if it believes that
by doing so it can save itself from de
feat.
