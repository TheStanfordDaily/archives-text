Senator Borah of Idaho declares that if
the Versailles treaty were revised and
the allied nations reduced their arma
ments they could pay the interest and
part of the principal of the debt they
owe the United States.
He says that if we fund their debt
they will use their surplus to construct
greater armaments. The allies, he main
tains. seek the economic destruction of
Germany. Such arguments may be ex
pected from Senator Borah.
