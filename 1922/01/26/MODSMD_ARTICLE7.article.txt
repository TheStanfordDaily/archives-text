# JORDAN SENDS ALUMNI LETTER ON ENDOWMENT
## Stanford Compared to Other Endowed Colleges; 9000 Alumni Are Sent Message 
### 
David Starr Jordan's message con
cerning the endowment campaign has
just been mailed to every graduate of
Stanford (University. Dr. Jordan, who
was president of the University at the
time the first prediction was made that
Stanford's bequest would not be suffi
cient for future expansion, gives in the
letter a brief comparison between Stan
ford and similarly endowed institutions
in the blast. His message follows:
January 23, 1922.
To the Alumni and Alumnae of Stan
ford University:
The historian of Stanford will begin
with this year a new chapter in her his
tory. With the funds provided by the
founders, a large sum thirty years ago,
her Trustees and President have made
the wisest possible use. In the fact of
great obstacles the University has stead
ily kept in the very front of educational
progress. But it has long been evident
that the initial gift could not be perma
nently adequate for Stanford, any more,
than the donations of John Harvard,
Eli Yale or Ezra Cornell would be suf
ficient to continue the growth of the
great institutions they founded.
The loyal sons of these Universities
have long since recognized their respon
sibilities and have generously responded.
Stanford is much younger than these
but not less ambitious, and the fact that
her sons and daughters are fewer should
inspire them to still greater activity. Our
University must grow more rapidly than
these if she is to sustain the reputation
already so well earned.
For myself. I welcome this new day.
I feel no greater satisfaction than that
of tracing among men and women of
Stanford, the influence of the Univer
sity, in their happy and uSeful lives. I
have been certain that when the time
came they would rejoice in making sac
rifices for their Alma Mater, even as
men and women in other colleges have
done. Every help in money or in energy
given to the University will be felt in
the life of the generations to come.
Better Stanford men and women we
shall be when we realize that the giving
cannot all be 011 one side. _ Something
of the. gains of our own lives we can
pour out toward our ambitions to make
Stanford University not the biggest,
most populous, or most illustrious, but
most thorough, progressive, and friendly
of all institutions of higher learning in
America.
1 am sure that success will crown your
efforts, for the Stanford spirit never
fails in an emergency.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) David Starr Jordan.
(Chancellor Emeritus)
