# STANFORD FIVE TO CLASH WITH O.A.C. TONIGHT
## Aggies Hold Victories Over Oregon; Third Conference Contest for Card Quintet 
### 
Safely by the first obstacle in the
Pacific Coast Conference, the Univer
sity of Oregon, Stanford's fast travel
ing basketball varsity moves to new
and harder fields of endeavor tonight
and meets the Oregon Aggies basket
ers at Corvallis.
It will be the third game in a six
day period for Van Gent's squad, and
marks the beginning of the last lap of
the northern invasion.
Largely on the whims and caprices
of one Marshall Hjelte, formerly of
Oakland and way stations, will depend
the magnitude of the Cardinal task
of whipping the strong Aggie quintet.
Hjelte, who is six feet six of muscle,
and all action, is the mainspring of
the Beaver attack. Center is his
technical position but during the game
he plays everything from standing
guard to forward.
Hjelte has been suffering from an
injured foot, which has slowed down
his play to a considerable extent. If
his injury is entirely well, he will
keep two Cardinals on the jump guard
ing him. The giant center has a sup
porting cast of no mean ability. Stin
son, veteran of last year's five, is his
right-hand man, and has tallied most
of the points for the Aggies thus far
this season.
It will be nothing novel, however,
for the fighting Card quintet to enter
the game on the short end of the odds.
The forwards, Davies and McHose,
seem to be at their best when they
have everything to win, and nothing
to lose.
Van Gent used but six players in the
series with Oregon. Mint Howell re
lieved Janssen for a time in both
games, but none of the other substi
tutes have got nearer the actual fray
than the side lines. If his first-string
men can stand the pace, it is hardly
likely that the Cardinal coach will
make any new changes in the line-up
tonight. Richmond and Janssen fail
ed to locate the baskets at Eugene,
with any considerable success, a field
goal apiece being the sum total of their
scoring efforts in both games.
McHose and Davies were not ham
pered much in their movements by the
Oregon guards, but they will find it a
little harder to get past the Beaver
defense tonight. McHose caused
quite a sensation among the northern
ers on account of his size and speed.
The same program is to be repeated
tomorrow night at C'orvallis. When
the second Aggie game is over, Van
Gent and his charges will board the
train for home, and the hardest part
of the Cardinal basketball season will
be over. On their arrival here, the
players will start preparing for the
California games on February 8.
In Seattle, Earl Wright's Bruin
basketers and the University of
Washington Vikings will have it out
in the so-called "crucial" series. Wash
ington.is favored to present the Blue
and Gold the wrong end of the score
in both games. Two victories over
California would practically clinch the
conference title for "Hec" Edmund
son's lads.
