# FINAL INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO CANVASS OF "FIRST MILLION"
## 
### 
The student body campaign for "The
First Million For Stanford," with a
campus quota of $200,000, will start
off Monday morning at 9 o'clock with
a University assembly. Workers in
every living group will begin the can
vass Monday evening, to continue un
til Friday, with the percentage of
pledges posted daily. The Daily Palo
Alto will publish a special six-page
endowment edition, with statements
from every student leader. Final in
structions for the convassing of the
entire University were given to the
250 solicitors at a meeting last night.
Because of the fact that records
from which the cards containing the
names and addresses of all students,
distributed last night, were inaccurate,
and many cards given out incorrectly,
the time in which lists of the organi
zation personnel of every living group,
and the number of persons to be
covered, has been extended until to
morrow morning at 9 o'clock. Every
unit which finds such inaccuracies, as
has been the case with Encina Hall,
may discard the card system and make
up their lists in their own way, with
one worker to every ten people and a
chairman for every group of solicit
ors, and have these lists in the hands
of their general division chairman.
Stoddard Atwood will receive all fra
ternity lists, Sequoia will turn in their
reports to Art Tyler, and C. J. Tauzer
will list Encina as soon as possible
and in any way practicable. The
women, who have already handed in
their lists will not need to make out
new ones, but may dispense with the
card system. Those organizations who
were not represented at the meeting
last night, will t'irn in their entire per
sonnel and submit the names of work
ers ft the endowment offices in the
council room of the Administration
Building, by 9 o'clock.
