# FINAL INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO CANVASS OF "FIRST MILLION"
## 
### 
The student body campaign for "The
First Million For Stanford," with a
campus quota of $200,000, will start
off Monday morning at 9 o'clock with
a University assembly. Workers in
every living group will begin the can
vass Monday evening, to continue un
til Friday, with the percentage of
pledges posted daily. The Daily Palo
Alto will publish a special six-page
endowment edition, with statements
from every student leader. Final in
structions for the convassing of the
entire University were given to the
250 solicitors at a meeting last night.
Because of the fact that records
from which the cards containing the
names and addresses of all students,
distributed last night, were inaccurate,
and many cards given out incorrectly,
the time in which lists of the organi
zation personnel of every living group,
and the number of persons to be
covered, has been extended until to
morrow morning at 9 o'clock. Every
unit which finds such inaccuracies, as
has been the case with Encina Hall,
may discard the card system and make
up their lists in their own way, with
one worker to every ten people and a
chairman for every group of solicit
ors, and have these lists in the hands
of their general division chairman.
Stoddard Atwood will receive all fra
ternity lists, Sequoia will turn in their
reports to Art Tyler, and C. J. Tauzer
will list Encina as soon as possible
and in any way practicable. The
women, who have already handed in
their lists will not need to make out
new ones, but may dispense with the
card system. Those organizations who
were not represented at the meeting
last night, will t'irn in their entire per
sonnel and submit the names of work
ers ft the endowment offices in the
council room of the Administration
Building, by 9 o'clock.
Explanation was made to as to the
method of securing pledges, which may
be filled out on a five-year installment
system, or in any way suited to the re
quirements of the student.
Comptroller Roth outlined to the
workers the program under which the
money raised is to be administered, and
told of the financial developments which
have made it increasingly difficult for
Stanford to maintain itself.
The first million dollars i.-* to be de
voted to faculty salaries, Roth said. The
General Education Board will contribute
$300,000 of this, as the result of an in
vestigation made in 1920. Experts sent
out by the Carnegie organization found
after looking over the University's books
that it was being well financed, with no
waste funds, but that it needed a great
deal more money for professors' sal
aries, to keep up the standards of other
institutions. All the great men on the
faculty will have to be replaced at some
time, Roth said, aiul the cost for the
new men will be much greater. Also, in
order to hold any of the men of ability
today, their salaries must be adequate,
which means that they must be in
creased greatly.
"We have never before asked for
help," said Roth, "and people who are
deeply interested in the welfare of the
University have not learned of our
needs. We must explain to these peo
ple that funds are necessary immedia
tely to retain the high type of Univer
sity professors here—professors who are
known throughout the world."
The second million is to be used in
the building program, which is divided
into four parts. There are 480 stu
dents who should be housed on the
campus, unable to be accommodated,
Roth asserted, or living in crowded
quarters in the halls. These men will
have living accommodations provided as
the first step in the building plan. Xo
fraternities or other established living
groups will be in any way affected by
tlie.se additions, Roth said. The second
part of the program calls for a Biologi
cal Building. This is essential to safe
guard the valuable specimens which the
University possesses, and which are at
present housed in attics, store-rooms, or
other available temporary places. The
removal of these specimens would also
do much to relieve the congestion on the
Quad, Rotli pointed out.
A new law library will be constructed
as the third step in the building pro
gram. This is a necessity to insure the
safety of the Law Library of the Uni
versity which is the best on the coast,
and is at present in a building not fire
proof. Lastly, the plan will include a
new gymnasium for women, to replace
the temporary structure, which was
originally built by Mrs. Stanford back
of old Roble.
"The third million, which will be for
the Medical School." continued Roth,
"will be raised principally in and around
San Francisco, where a great number
of people are interested and anxious to
help.
"Tlu* Medical School takes only from
13 to 14 per cent of Stanford's funds,
though it is often stated that a great
amount of the funds of the I niversitv
goes to support it. Only $119,000 was
was used last year in its upkeep. The
Medical School is our strongest de
partment and our best approach to the
public, as every one knows of its work
in its three departments—the Medical
Sciiool proper (the old Cooper Medical
College), the Lane Hospital and Clinic,
and the Stanford Hospital. The Stan
ford Hospital is especially becoming
well known, and has been pronounced
by medical authorities to be one of the
best in America. It having a rapidly
increasing patronage, and is already on
a paying basis."
Comptroller Roth gave a resume of
tlie financial development of Stanford,
in which he brought out the fact that
tuition was made a requisite of aid given
by any of the large resources available,
such as the General Education Board
of the Carnegie Foundation. 1 bis was
in addition to the fact that the ever
increasing costs made tuition inevitable.
The General Education Board, when ap
proached. said that Stafford would have
to help itself before any consideration
of outside help could be given.
The original bequest amounted to
$32,000,0C0, of which $26,000,000 re
mained for investment after the build
ings had been completed. But this sum,
Roth pointed out, was invested in rail
road bonds, which pay only about 4
26-100 per cent, an income so low as to
be one-third less than present rates.
"Eastern universities faced crucila sit
uations at the outbreak of the war. and
were forced to raise additional endow
ment," said Roth. "Harvard has raised
$17,000,000. Stanford was fortunate
enough to escape this first crisis, as a
number of the large farms which the
University had been spending money to
maintain, were sold at a large profit,
about $600,000 being returned by the
sale. In spite of this, and in spite of
the tuition, Stanford went in the hole
$200,000 in the past two years. If it
wasn't for the tuition, the amount of
debt would probably have been $400,000."

Roth asserted, or living in crowded
quarters in the halls. These men will
have living accommodations provided as
the first step in the building plan. Xo
fraternities or other established living
groups will be in any way affected by
tlie.se additions, Roth said. The second
part of the program calls for a Biologi
cal Building. This is essential to safe
guard the valuable specimens which the
University possesses, and which are at
present housed in attics, store-rooms, or
other available temporary places. The
removal of these specimens would also
do much to relieve the congestion on the
Quad, Rotli pointed out.
A new law library will be constructed
as the third step in the building pro
gram. This is a necessity to insure the
safety of the Law Library of the Uni
versity which is the best on the coast,
and is at present in a building not fire
proof. Lastly, the plan will include a
new gymnasium for women, to replace
the temporary structure, which was
originally built by Mrs. Stanford back
of old Roble.
"The third million, which will be for
the Medical School." continued Roth,
"will be raised principally in and around
San Francisco, where a great number
of people are interested and anxious to
help.
"Tlu* Medical School takes only from
13 to 14 per cent of Stanford's funds,
though it is often stated that a great
amount of the funds of the I niversitv
goes to support it. Only $119,000 was
was used last year in its upkeep. The
Medical School is our strongest de
partment and our best approach to the
public, as every one knows of its work
in its three departments—the Medical
Sciiool proper (the old Cooper Medical
College), the Lane Hospital and Clinic,
and the Stanford Hospital. The Stan
ford Hospital is especially becoming
well known, and has been pronounced
by medical authorities to be one of the
best in America. It having a rapidly
increasing patronage, and is already on
a paying basis."
Comptroller Roth gave a resume of
tlie financial development of Stanford,
in which he brought out the fact that
tuition was made a requisite of aid given
by any of the large resources available,
such as the General Education Board
of the Carnegie Foundation. 1 bis was
in addition to the fact that the ever
increasing costs made tuition inevitable.
The General Education Board, when ap
proached. said that Stafford would have
to help itself before any consideration
of outside help could be given.
The original bequest amounted to
$32,000,0C0, of which $26,000,000 re
mained for investment after the build
ings had been completed. But this sum,
Roth pointed out, was invested in rail
road bonds, which pay only about 4
26-100 per cent, an income so low as to
be one-third less than present rates.
"Eastern universities faced crucila sit
uations at the outbreak of the war. and
were forced to raise additional endow
ment," said Roth. "Harvard has raised
$17,000,000. Stanford was fortunate
enough to escape this first crisis, as a
number of the large farms which the
University had been spending money to
maintain, were sold at a large profit,
about $600,000 being returned by the
sale. In spite of this, and in spite of
the tuition, Stanford went in the hole
$200,000 in the past two years. If it
wasn't for the tuition, the amount of
debt would probably have been $400,000."
The student body campaign for "The
First Million For Stanford," with a
campus quota of $200,000, will start
off Monday morning at 9 o'clock with
a University assembly. Workers in
every living group will begin the can
vass Monday evening, to continue un
til Friday, with the percentage of
pledges posted daily. The Daily Palo
Alto will publish a special six-page
endowment edition, with statements
from every student leader. Final in
structions for the convassing of the
entire University were given to the
250 solicitors at a meeting last night.
Because of the fact that records
from which the cards containing the
names and addresses of all students,
distributed last night, were inaccurate,
and many cards given out incorrectly,
the time in which lists of the organi
zation personnel of every living group,
and the number of persons to be
covered, has been extended until to
morrow morning at 9 o'clock. Every
unit which finds such inaccuracies, as
has been the case with Encina Hall,
may discard the card system and make
up their lists in their own way, with
one worker to every ten people and a
chairman for every group of solicit
ors, and have these lists in the hands
of their general division chairman.
Stoddard Atwood will receive all fra
ternity lists, Sequoia will turn in their
reports to Art Tyler, and C. J. Tauzer
will list Encina as soon as possible
and in any way practicable. The
women, who have already handed in
their lists will not need to make out
new ones, but may dispense with the
card system. Those organizations who
were not represented at the meeting
last night, will t'irn in their entire per
sonnel and submit the names of work
ers ft the endowment offices in the
council room of the Administration
Building, by 9 o'clock.
Explanation was made to as to the
method of securing pledges, which may
be filled out on a five-year installment
system, or in any way suited to the re
quirements of the student.
Comptroller Roth outlined to the
workers the program under which the
money raised is to be administered, and
told of the financial developments which
have made it increasingly difficult for
Stanford to maintain itself.
The first million dollars i.-* to be de
voted to faculty salaries, Roth said. The
General Education Board will contribute
$300,000 of this, as the result of an in
vestigation made in 1920. Experts sent
out by the Carnegie organization found
after looking over the University's books
that it was being well financed, with no
waste funds, but that it needed a great
deal more money for professors' sal
aries, to keep up the standards of other
institutions. All the great men on the
faculty will have to be replaced at some
time, Roth said, aiul the cost for the
new men will be much greater. Also, in
order to hold any of the men of ability
today, their salaries must be adequate,
which means that they must be in
creased greatly.
"We have never before asked for
help," said Roth, "and people who are
deeply interested in the welfare of the
University have not learned of our
needs. We must explain to these peo
ple that funds are necessary immedia
tely to retain the high type of Univer
sity professors here—professors who are
known throughout the world."
The second million is to be used in
the building program, which is divided
into four parts. There are 480 stu
dents who should be housed on the
campus, unable to be accommodated,
Roth asserted, or living in crowded
quarters in the halls. These men will
have living accommodations provided as
the first step in the building plan. Xo

debt would probably have been $400,000."
The student body campaign for "The
First Million For Stanford," with a
campus quota of $200,000, will start
off Monday morning at 9 o'clock with
a University assembly. Workers in
every living group will begin the can
vass Monday evening, to continue un
til Friday, with the percentage of
pledges posted daily. The Daily Palo
Alto will publish a special six-page
endowment edition, with statements
from every student leader. Final in
structions for the convassing of the
entire University were given to the
250 solicitors at a meeting last night.
Because of the fact that records
from which the cards containing the
names and addresses of all students,
distributed last night, were inaccurate,
and many cards given out incorrectly,
the time in which lists of the organi
zation personnel of every living group,
and the number of persons to be
covered, has been extended until to
morrow morning at 9 o'clock. Every
unit which finds such inaccuracies, as
has been the case with Encina Hall,
may discard the card system and make
up their lists in their own way, with
one worker to every ten people and a
chairman for every group of solicit
ors, and have these lists in the hands
of their general division chairman.
Stoddard Atwood will receive all fra
ternity lists, Sequoia will turn in their
reports to Art Tyler, and C. J. Tauzer
will list Encina as soon as possible
and in any way practicable. The
women, who have already handed in
their lists will not need to make out
new ones, but may dispense with the
card system. Those organizations who
were not represented at the meeting
last night, will t'irn in their entire per
sonnel and submit the names of work
ers ft the endowment offices in the
council room of the Administration
Building, by 9 o'clock.
Explanation was made to as to the
method of securing pledges, which may
be filled out on a five-year installment
system, or in any way suited to the re
quirements of the student.
Comptroller Roth outlined to the
workers the program under which the
money raised is to be administered, and
told of the financial developments which
have made it increasingly difficult for
Stanford to maintain itself.
The first million dollars i.-* to be de
voted to faculty salaries, Roth said. The
General Education Board will contribute
$300,000 of this, as the result of an in
vestigation made in 1920. Experts sent
out by the Carnegie organization found
after looking over the University's books
that it was being well financed, with no
waste funds, but that it needed a great
deal more money for professors' sal
aries, to keep up the standards of other
institutions. All the great men on the
faculty will have to be replaced at some
time, Roth said, aiul the cost for the
new men will be much greater. Also, in
order to hold any of the men of ability
today, their salaries must be adequate,
which means that they must be in
creased greatly.
"We have never before asked for
help," said Roth, "and people who are
deeply interested in the welfare of the
University have not learned of our
needs. We must explain to these peo
ple that funds are necessary immedia
tely to retain the high type of Univer
sity professors here—professors who are
known throughout the world."
The second million is to be used in
the building program, which is divided
into four parts. There are 480 stu
dents who should be housed on the
campus, unable to be accommodated,
Roth asserted, or living in crowded
quarters in the halls. These men will
have living accommodations provided as
the first step in the building plan. Xo
fraternities or other established living
groups will be in any way affected by
tlie.se additions, Roth said. The second
part of the program calls for a Biologi
cal Building. This is essential to safe
guard the valuable specimens which the
University possesses, and which are at
present housed in attics, store-rooms, or
other available temporary places. The
removal of these specimens would also
do much to relieve the congestion on the
Quad, Rotli pointed out.
A new law library will be constructed
as the third step in the building pro
gram. This is a necessity to insure the
safety of the Law Library of the Uni
versity which is the best on the coast,
and is at present in a building not fire
proof. Lastly, the plan will include a
new gymnasium for women, to replace
the temporary structure, which was
originally built by Mrs. Stanford back
of old Roble.
"The third million, which will be for
the Medical School." continued Roth,
"will be raised principally in and around
San Francisco, where a great number
of people are interested and anxious to
help.
"Tlu* Medical School takes only from
13 to 14 per cent of Stanford's funds,
though it is often stated that a great
amount of the funds of the I niversitv
goes to support it. Only $119,000 was
was used last year in its upkeep. The
Medical School is our strongest de
partment and our best approach to the
public, as every one knows of its work
in its three departments—the Medical
Sciiool proper (the old Cooper Medical
College), the Lane Hospital and Clinic,
and the Stanford Hospital. The Stan
ford Hospital is especially becoming
well known, and has been pronounced
by medical authorities to be one of the
best in America. It having a rapidly
increasing patronage, and is already on
a paying basis."
Comptroller Roth gave a resume of
tlie financial development of Stanford,
in which he brought out the fact that
tuition was made a requisite of aid given
by any of the large resources available,
such as the General Education Board
of the Carnegie Foundation. 1 bis was
in addition to the fact that the ever
increasing costs made tuition inevitable.
The General Education Board, when ap
proached. said that Stafford would have
to help itself before any consideration
of outside help could be given.
The original bequest amounted to
$32,000,0C0, of which $26,000,000 re
mained for investment after the build
ings had been completed. But this sum,
Roth pointed out, was invested in rail
road bonds, which pay only about 4
26-100 per cent, an income so low as to
be one-third less than present rates.
"Eastern universities faced crucila sit
uations at the outbreak of the war. and
were forced to raise additional endow
ment," said Roth. "Harvard has raised
$17,000,000. Stanford was fortunate
enough to escape this first crisis, as a
number of the large farms which the
University had been spending money to
maintain, were sold at a large profit,
about $600,000 being returned by the
sale. In spite of this, and in spite of
the tuition, Stanford went in the hole
$200,000 in the past two years. If it
wasn't for the tuition, the amount of
debt would probably have been $400,000."

into four parts. There are 480 stu
dents who should be housed on the
campus, unable to be accommodated,
Roth asserted, or living in crowded
quarters in the halls. These men will
have living accommodations provided as
the first step in the building plan. Xo
fraternities or other established living
groups will be in any way affected by
tlie.se additions, Roth said. The second
part of the program calls for a Biologi
cal Building. This is essential to safe
guard the valuable specimens which the
University possesses, and which are at
present housed in attics, store-rooms, or
other available temporary places. The
removal of these specimens would also
do much to relieve the congestion on the
Quad, Rotli pointed out.
A new law library will be constructed
as the third step in the building pro
gram. This is a necessity to insure the
safety of the Law Library of the Uni
versity which is the best on the coast,
and is at present in a building not fire
proof. Lastly, the plan will include a
new gymnasium for women, to replace
the temporary structure, which was
originally built by Mrs. Stanford back
of old Roble.
"The third million, which will be for
the Medical School." continued Roth,
"will be raised principally in and around
San Francisco, where a great number
of people are interested and anxious to
help.
"Tlu* Medical School takes only from
13 to 14 per cent of Stanford's funds,
though it is often stated that a great
amount of the funds of the I niversitv
goes to support it. Only $119,000 was
was used last year in its upkeep. The
Medical School is our strongest de
partment and our best approach to the
public, as every one knows of its work
in its three departments—the Medical
Sciiool proper (the old Cooper Medical
College), the Lane Hospital and Clinic,
and the Stanford Hospital. The Stan
ford Hospital is especially becoming
well known, and has been pronounced
by medical authorities to be one of the
best in America. It having a rapidly
increasing patronage, and is already on
a paying basis."
Comptroller Roth gave a resume of
tlie financial development of Stanford,
in which he brought out the fact that
tuition was made a requisite of aid given
by any of the large resources available,
such as the General Education Board
of the Carnegie Foundation. 1 bis was
in addition to the fact that the ever
increasing costs made tuition inevitable.
The General Education Board, when ap
proached. said that Stafford would have
to help itself before any consideration
of outside help could be given.
The original bequest amounted to
$32,000,0C0, of which $26,000,000 re
mained for investment after the build
ings had been completed. But this sum,
Roth pointed out, was invested in rail
road bonds, which pay only about 4
26-100 per cent, an income so low as to
be one-third less than present rates.
"Eastern universities faced crucila sit
uations at the outbreak of the war. and
were forced to raise additional endow
ment," said Roth. "Harvard has raised
$17,000,000. Stanford was fortunate
enough to escape this first crisis, as a
number of the large farms which the
University had been spending money to
maintain, were sold at a large profit,
about $600,000 being returned by the
sale. In spite of this, and in spite of
the tuition, Stanford went in the hole
$200,000 in the past two years. If it
wasn't for the tuition, the amount of
debt would probably have been $400,000."
