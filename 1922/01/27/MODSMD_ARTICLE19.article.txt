\\ 1 lilt constitutes cockiness in a freshman, and who
is capable of judging? The entering student is re
garded as especially fresh if he dares to venture an
opinion on any subject. I f he breaks into a gather
ing of older men and attempts to take part in their
conversation he is immediately dubbed as "cocky."
I Were fore, he must be disciplined.
Freshmen may be classified into two large groups.
I here is the fellow who is naturally spirited and quite
forward in his actions. He usually has a mind of
bis own and balks at being dictated to by others prol»-
ably no older than himself, but who have been here
longer. 1 he other type is the fellow who is momen
tarily struck by a sense of his own importance, and is.
temporarily conceited over his arrival in college.
There are a few men who do not fit into either class,
and these men usually have their purpose here pretty
well defined in their minds and have time neither for
conceit nor talkfests* Discipline of the sort that lias
come to l>e regarded as traditional in Stanford is
administered to the first two types by self-appointed
masters, sometimes with apparent justice, and trtore
.oftet], because of individual malice.
'Hie freshman who will have his say despite the
hidebound customs he is warned to observe is done
no good by this discipline, It is administered fre
quently and often severely throughout his first year.
In his second year he is still the same forward young
man, but his impetuous spirit is now tolerated be
cause he is no longer a freshman. He has passed
through his "baptism of fire"—and water -and he
can have his say in matters that were none of his
business before, although nothing has been done to fit
him to have broader opinions.
The man who passes through his first year be
comes the disciplinarian of the freshman and the
enforcement officer for the upperclassmen. After
wasting his second year in disciplining the freshman
he turns to some other activity, and often finds that
others who have not wasted their first years in herd
ing freshmen are ahead of him.
No one questions the right of a junior or senior
to voice an opinion, because he has been in the Uni
versity long enough to be regarded as an authority
on anything he chooses to discuss, fundamentally,
he is the same person who entered as a freshman
three or four years before. l>y passing through the
successive steps of his college life he has acquired
the right to speak his mind freely, and he takes the
place that was rightfully his when he came, that of
a leader in some activity. The system has wasted

his energies for two years and curbed rather than
broadened him.
The freshman who is temporarily conceited and
is bothered by a sense of his own importance is also
disciplined, but the effect on him is different. He
is antagonized by the petty orderings of the sopho
mores and he becomes embittered. In his sophomore
year he gives vent to his bitterness by disciplining
someone else. He, too, wastes his second year. In
the third year he turns to some activity, but often it is
too late for him to give or get all that he can from it.
This type of entering student could easily be
laughed out of his conceit. An upperclassman could,
in a fatherly way, tell this man to look around him
and see what other men were doing in every line and
by laughing at his self-importance make him see his
true place. Conceit at its worst is only a temporary
condition, and the hard knocks a man receives in com
petition with others will soon eradicate it entirely
from his make-up, if he has the material for a real
man in him. If he hasn't, discipline will not put it in
him.
How long are we going to continue to dissipate
the energies of these two underclasses? Some day,
and that day not far distant, a second-year class is
going to awaken to the fact that by giving so much
attention to the freshmen they are wasting precious
time and are doing practically nothing for themselves
and for Stanford. When that realization comes,
those sophomores will turn to directing the energies
of the freshmen along the right lines instead of dissi
pating them. That will mark the beginning of a new
and worth-while era in Stanford undergraduate ac
tivities.
