A Quiet Evening's Study
(Play, in one act.)
Characters: A. M. Bition, well-known member of
Delta Beta, seated at table covered with one book,
cigarette, tray, pipe, pictures, etc., Agent.
Time: A little later.
♦ * »
A. M. Bition—Well, well. (Denoting deep thought).
At last I have fifteen minutes free to do my work for
tomorrow. CStarts to study.)
Agent for Mangle Laundry Company enters.
Agent (threateningly).—Any cleaning, pressing, sox
pressed, pants darned. . . .
A. M. Bition. (Ceases study of Translation of Odyssey.
. . . looks up)— No.
Agent slinks out without another word and softly
closes door, as agents always do.
One minute later.
Agent for Drive to Relieve Stanford Students of as
Much as Possible, enters.
Agent—Hello. I —
Student —O, hell. (Jumps out of window. He and the
curtain fall together.)

Dear Editor:—l'm here, and 1 s'noulda wrote before.
But several rushing engagements have kept me too
busy. However, the Soph that shares my room with
me says that there won't be any inyre rushing parties
till later.
I am writing to let you know how the university im
presses me.
Women around here are sure scarce. My room-mate
(He's a bootlegger's son) he says, "No matter, how scarce
the women get, 1 always have my gal."
I see how all the students has got to engage in some
activity besides rushing, and so, it being that my uncle
is a very literary man (he owns the best news-stand in
Los Angeles) I thought I'd try that line. I'm working
on a tragedy in three parts, entitled "Soupbeans, Pie. or
What's Inn the Union." Maybe if it gets published I'll
be popular like my room-mate was. At least the Count
will be after me.
The prof said he'd flunk me for two cents, but be
cause of the high fees around here now I bet he'll flunk
me for a quarter.
Another thing. Mr. Editor, why don't we say hello to
'I'llis word queening has got me in a lot of trouble
lately, would you please explain what it means. The
other morning a girl in my Spanish class dropped a
book. I picked it up, handed it to her, and starts to
explain how my sister's name is Mary, too. Just then
a couple of Sophs came along, and hollered "Queener",
and they paddled me right, on the Quad.
Then last night we was having a game, and I said,
"I got aces, whats in your hand?"
"Queen'n Jacks," he says. "I win."
Please explain.
Respectively,
Oswald.

Dear Head of Cabbage:—l am a commuter from Palo
Alto the campus, and I have an eight o'clock every
morning at eight o'clock. Often the street car has all
the seats taken, most of them by men. Would it not
be proper for them to give me a seat?
MIMI O. GRAPH.

Dear Mimi: —Here is a way you might get a seat:
Pick out a young man who has that kind of a look,
smile at him, and look wistfully at the seat lie is occu
pying. Shift your weight from one foot to the other. If
it is already on that foot., shift back. Look tired. If
the seat, is not offered to you. get off and walk.
Yours in haste.

on a tragedy in three parts, entitled "Soupbeans, Pie. or
What's Inn the Union." Maybe if it gets published I'll
be popular like my room-mate was. At least the Count

The prof said he'd flunk me for two cents, but be
cause of the high fees around here now I bet he'll flunk
me for a quarter.
Another thing. Mr. Editor, why don't we say hello to
'I'llis word queening has got me in a lot of trouble
lately, would you please explain what it means. The
other morning a girl in my Spanish class dropped a
book. I picked it up, handed it to her, and starts to
explain how my sister's name is Mary, too. Just then
a couple of Sophs came along, and hollered "Queener",
and they paddled me right, on the Quad.
Then last night we was having a game, and I said,
"I got aces, whats in your hand?"
"Queen'n Jacks," he says. "I win."
Please explain.
Respectively,
Oswald.

Dear Head of Cabbage:—l am a commuter from Palo
Alto the campus, and I have an eight o'clock every
morning at eight o'clock. Often the street car has all
the seats taken, most of them by men. Would it not
be proper for them to give me a seat?

Dear Mimi: —Here is a way you might get a seat:
Pick out a young man who has that kind of a look,
smile at him, and look wistfully at the seat lie is occu
pying. Shift your weight from one foot to the other. If
it is already on that foot., shift back. Look tired. If
the seat, is not offered to you. get off and walk.
