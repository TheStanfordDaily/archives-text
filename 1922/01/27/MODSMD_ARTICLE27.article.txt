## 
### 
"Everyone capable of holding a club
should try out for the varsity golf
team next week," says Captain Rosen
blatt. Scores may be played on any
links desired, and must be certified by
the tryoutee's opponent, preferably a
member of the team. Three rounds
of eighteen holes each should be turn
ed in to B. Frankenheimer in 121 EiT
cilia before February loth. The
names of successful men will be an
nounced the day following the conclu
sion of the tryouts.
Although all the members of last
year's team, Frankenheimer, Rosen
blatt, Miller, Putnam, and Kleiser, re
turned to the Universtiy this year, not
all of them will be able to play, and
at least three new men will be needed

as a five or six man team will be used
this year.
The date for the match with Cali
fornia has been about decided for
February 18, and the California team,
in order to make it easier for Stan
ford has agreed to play on the Lake
side or California Club links. Both
links will require all the shots the
players have in their bags. If the
original plan of playing at Berkeley
ad been adhered to It would have
been necessary to take two days for
the match, on-account of the time re
quired for traveling.
Captain Rosenblatt believes that
there is no doubt but that the Blue
and Gold can be defeated if the golfers
at Stanford will but tryout in ordinary
numbers. The defeat last fall was
due to lack of material for the team.
When the six men are selected there
will be a practice round on the links
finally chosen.
Fred Le Blonde, who played number
one on the California squad last spring,
but was not a member of the team that
beat Stanford in the fall, has returned
to California, this year, and will materi
ally strengthen their chances.
