# PROFESSORS SHOULD NOT LIMIT WORK, SAYS WILBUR
## Outside Work Helps Prevent Fossilizing, President Believes 
### 
Belief that college professors should not limit their work to the universi
ties in which they teach, but should from time to time take some part in
activities outside their college work along lines of their specialties, and be
paid for this outside work, is the opinion expressed by President Wilbur in
his annual report, now in the hands of the printer, covering the last academic
year.
President Wilbur thinks that this outside work is good for the world, the
college, and the individual professor. The university, he says, "must keep its
fundamental work in contact with the advances being made in the various
professions. One of the ways to keep a faculty group from becoming pro
vincial and fossilizing is to bring in from the outside men who are engaged in
the work of the world, and to have men on the various faculties take part
to some extent in the life outside."
In his report, besides sketching the progress of Stanford University in
its various departments through the year, President Wilbur takes occasion

to present a general survey of the
problems and opportunities which
face an endowed university, such as
Stanford is.
He points out that an endowed uni
versity is in a position of freedom
to set the pace in educational progress
for other institutions which are ham
pered by necessities that do not bind
the college relying exclusively upon
its own endowments. On the other
hand, the fact that the endowed uni
versity must rely altogether upon its
endowment funds and gifts compels it
to restrict itself in some ways in
order to maintain the high standards
which it ought to uphold.
One of the most interesting passages
in this discussion concerns the rela
tion of an endowed university to out
side industry. In this connection Dr.
Wilbur says:
"If the university is to maintain
its leadership it is important that it
shall be fully in touch with every
thing in the way of progress that is
going outsite either in sociology, fi
nance, literature, or science. It must
keep its fundamental work in contact
with the advances being made in the
various professions. Particularly in
scientific lines it needs association
with great industrial enterprises based,
as they must inevitably be, upon the
facts of science.
The maintenance of the future hap
piness of the human race, the elevation
of tlie standards of living, the rise <>f
the economic level, the spread of the or
dinary common sense needed to prevent
the destruction of civilization by war,
will come more from the university
class roon'i and laboratory 'than from
any other source. The leadership of
trained brains, the knowledge of the ex
pert, the voice of history, are sorely
needed and they can come, most ef
fectively from within tlje walls of our
colleges and universities. One bit of
new knowledge may change our rela
tionships to power, to agriculture, or any
one of the great fundamentals of our
common life.
"During the war members of college
faculties were found to possess unusual
qualification for the new and unexpected
positions that arose on every hand.
There is every reason why the superior
type of mind that enters - a university
faculty should be capable of handling
practical problems on the outside.
"While the term 'academic* has come
to refer to tilings that are. of no imme
diate practical interest, as a matter of
fact large parts of the present univer
sity curricula have as their major con
text the solution of practical affairs.
Probably the most important way in
which the university can obtain that
assistance from the outside world that
is necessary for advance is by having
members of the faculty take part from
time to time in enterprises where un
usual knowledge or unusual skill is re
quired. Ordinary hack work should not
be considered. The university should
be willing to allow the capable members
of its staff to spend a portion of their
time in outside work receiving compen
sation therefor. The university ordi
narily pays for nine months of service
and anticipates that the rest of the time
will be. taken in scholarly development
and in physical rehabilitation. No
eight-hour day is possible in academic
life for the man who wishes to lead in
his particular field. There is a marked
strain about educational work. Long
hours are needed for study and relaxa
tion must be had by mental workers if
they are not to wear out. Often em
ployment on the outside of a practical
character along the lines which have
been the basis of instruction are re
freshing to faculty men."

"During the war members of college
faculties were found to possess unusual
qualification for the new and unexpected
positions that arose on every hand.
There is every reason why the superior
type of mind that enters - a university
faculty should be capable of handling
practical problems on the outside.
"While the term 'academic* has come
to refer to tilings that are. of no imme

Probably the most important way in
which the university can obtain that
assistance from the outside world that
is necessary for advance is by having
members of the faculty take part from
time to time in enterprises where un
usual knowledge or unusual skill is re
quired. Ordinary hack work should not
be considered. The university should
be willing to allow the capable members
of its staff to spend a portion of their
time in outside work receiving compen

and anticipates that the rest of the time
will be. taken in scholarly development

Belief that college professors should not limit their work to the universi
ties in which they teach, but should from time to time take some part in
activities outside their college work along lines of their specialties, and be
paid for this outside work, is the opinion expressed by President Wilbur in
his annual report, now in the hands of the printer, covering the last academic
year.
President Wilbur thinks that this outside work is good for the world, the
college, and the individual professor. The university, he says, "must keep its
fundamental work in contact with the advances being made in the various
professions. One of the ways to keep a faculty group from becoming pro
vincial and fossilizing is to bring in from the outside men who are engaged in
the work of the world, and to have men on the various faculties take part
to some extent in the life outside."
In his report, besides sketching the progress of Stanford University in
its various departments through the year, President Wilbur takes occasion

to present a general survey of the
problems and opportunities which
face an endowed university, such as
Stanford is.
He points out that an endowed uni
versity is in a position of freedom
to set the pace in educational progress
for other institutions which are ham
pered by necessities that do not bind
the college relying exclusively upon
its own endowments. On the other
hand, the fact that the endowed uni
versity must rely altogether upon its
endowment funds and gifts compels it
to restrict itself in some ways in
order to maintain the high standards
which it ought to uphold.
One of the most interesting passages
in this discussion concerns the rela
tion of an endowed university to out
side industry. In this connection Dr.
Wilbur says:
"If the university is to maintain
its leadership it is important that it
shall be fully in touch with every
thing in the way of progress that is
going outsite either in sociology, fi
nance, literature, or science. It must
keep its fundamental work in contact
with the advances being made in the
various professions. Particularly in
scientific lines it needs association
with great industrial enterprises based,
as they must inevitably be, upon the
facts of science.
