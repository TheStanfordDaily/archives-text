# PROFESSORS SHOULD NOT LIMIT WORK, SAYS WILBUR
## Outside Work Helps Prevent Fossilizing, President Believes 
### 
Belief that college professors should not limit their work to the universi
ties in which they teach, but should from time to time take some part in
activities outside their college work along lines of their specialties, and be
paid for this outside work, is the opinion expressed by President Wilbur in
his annual report, now in the hands of the printer, covering the last academic
year.
President Wilbur thinks that this outside work is good for the world, the
college, and the individual professor. The university, he says, "must keep its
fundamental work in contact with the advances being made in the various
professions. One of the ways to keep a faculty group from becoming pro
vincial and fossilizing is to bring in from the outside men who are engaged in
the work of the world, and to have men on the various faculties take part
to some extent in the life outside."
In his report, besides sketching the progress of Stanford University in
its various departments through the year, President Wilbur takes occasion

to present a general survey of the
problems and opportunities which
face an endowed university, such as
Stanford is.
He points out that an endowed uni
versity is in a position of freedom
to set the pace in educational progress
for other institutions which are ham
pered by necessities that do not bind
the college relying exclusively upon
its own endowments. On the other
hand, the fact that the endowed uni
versity must rely altogether upon its
endowment funds and gifts compels it
to restrict itself in some ways in
order to maintain the high standards
which it ought to uphold.
One of the most interesting passages
in this discussion concerns the rela
tion of an endowed university to out
side industry. In this connection Dr.
Wilbur says:
"If the university is to maintain
its leadership it is important that it
shall be fully in touch with every
thing in the way of progress that is
going outsite either in sociology, fi
nance, literature, or science. It must
keep its fundamental work in contact
with the advances being made in the
various professions. Particularly in
scientific lines it needs association
with great industrial enterprises based,
as they must inevitably be, upon the
facts of science.
