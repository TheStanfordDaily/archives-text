# INTERCLASS SWIM CAPTURED BY '25
## Sophomores Get Second With 25 Points and Seniors Nose Out Juniors by One Point 
### 
Freshman swimmers took first hon
ors with a total of 32 points in the
winter quarter inter-class swimming
meet which was held in the Kncina pool
yesterday afternoon. The sophomores
managed to gather 25 points which
gained them the second place. The bat
tle for third place was waged between
the two upper-class teams but the fourth
year men were able to add one more
point to their total than were the jun
iors who made 18 points and thus placed
the '23 men in the lowest position.
Inter-class swimming attracted more
entrants than any other meet has for
many years and possibly in the history
of swimming at Stanford. In some
events, elimination races were held 011
the previous days to see what men
should represent the different events.
The four-man relay was the lirst event
on the program and all present witnessed
an exciting race which ended with little,
space separating the three men at the
tape. The juniors were the only class
that did not enter a team. The '25 team
barely nosed out the senior squad.
The 50-yard race was very close with
only a few inches separating the lirst
two men. Fred Klebahn, captain of the
freshman team, just heat Austin, varsity
star and member of the junior team in
26:4 seconds which is the same time
as the Stanford-California freshman
record for this race.
Wooster, '22. swam a very pretty race
in the 220-vard contest and showed the
spectators that Stanford has a fa>t man
in this event. Fletcher's time fur the
66-yard breast stroke race was very
fast. On Thursday, when the plunge
for distance was held, Chittendon, '25.
surprised the spectators by plunging 67
feet 9 inches. This is one of the best
plunging marks made in the local tank
for quite a while, according to Coach
Ernst Brandsten. Charles Watson, '23,
navigated the 66-yard back stroke race
in fast time.
After the meet, Coach Brandsten ex
pressed himself as being highly elated
over the showing in all the events and
especially over the record made by the
first-year men.
In the diving competition, White
easily defeated the four other contest
ants. White practices very consistently,
and Coach Brandsten believes that he
will soon be one of the leading divers
of the coast. He seems to be filling the
vacancy left by Clarence Pinkston in a
highly efficient manner.

Freshman swimmers took first hon
ors with a total of 32 points in the
winter quarter inter-class swimming
meet which was held in the Kncina pool
yesterday afternoon. The sophomores
managed to gather 25 points which
gained them the second place. The bat
tle for third place was waged between
the two upper-class teams but the fourth
year men were able to add one more
point to their total than were the jun
iors who made 18 points and thus placed
the '23 men in the lowest position.
Inter-class swimming attracted more
entrants than any other meet has for
many years and possibly in the history
of swimming at Stanford. In some
events, elimination races were held 011
the previous days to see what men
should represent the different events.
The four-man relay was the lirst event
on the program and all present witnessed
an exciting race which ended with little,
space separating the three men at the
tape. The juniors were the only class
that did not enter a team. The '25 team
barely nosed out the senior squad.
The 50-yard race was very close with
only a few inches separating the lirst
two men. Fred Klebahn, captain of the
freshman team, just heat Austin, varsity
star and member of the junior team in
26:4 seconds which is the same time
as the Stanford-California freshman
record for this race.
Wooster, '22. swam a very pretty race
