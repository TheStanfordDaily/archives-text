# LIGHTWEIGHT QUINTETS WILL PLAY TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tomorrow night Coach Young's light
weights take <m the second Quintet of
the season, Lowell High School. Yes
terday <'ind today were spent in forma
tion practice and basket shooting and
the result is a far more efficient team
than that which defeated the Redwood
lads last Wednesday.
The dope has it that Lowell is a
great deal weaker than Stanford and
so should prove a meek victim. Red
wood City came out winners over them
a short time, ago, which looks encourag
ing, because the squad has been strength
ened some by practice since the Cards
beat the Sequoias.
For the superstitious, however, this
might be interpreted as a bad sign. Al
most every set-up that has come Stan
ford's way this year has arrived at the
moment of rally. The Sagehens were
supposed to roll over and play dead at
the sight of a red jersev when they
came here this fall, and, instead, they
almost returned to Nevada with the
Cardinal scalp under their belts. As it
was, the Reno team got all of the glory
and most of the money.
St. Ignatius was another squad which
hit the campus under a cloud of disfa
vor. The bleachers were moved to pity
for the poor boys who were in for such
a beating before the very eyes of Glenn
Warner. What the Pittsburgh coach
saw made it look bad for the confessed
dopester.
The best of guarding can't keep out
every long shot and there are sure, to
be fouls. If the inaccuracy in basket
shooting reoccurs with the midgets and
their passing is intercepted with the
regularity that it was stopped in the
last game, there is a good chance for
any fighting five to down them.
Coach Young has been working the
same men together who started the first
game. This means that unless Kitou
is replaced by Koba, he and Meyers
will probably start the action in the for
ward positions. Hogle is the likely man
for center. There seems no good rea
son that Young should coach from the
bench, so he will no dobt play running
guard himself as there is no other strong
contender for the job. Captain Silviera
will play under the basket.
Four more certain games arc. on the
lightweight schedule and three hang in
the balance. Manager J. B. Sansone
hopes to rake a contest with the Olym
pic Club out of the fire next Tuesday,
but as yet has no definite announcement
to make.
The Lowell game will start at 7:15.

terday <'ind today were spent in forma
tion practice and basket shooting and
the result is a far more efficient team
than that which defeated the Redwood
lads last Wednesday.
The dope has it that Lowell is a
great deal weaker than Stanford and
so should prove a meek victim. Red
wood City came out winners over them
a short time, ago, which looks encourag
ing, because the squad has been strength
ened some by practice since the Cards
beat the Sequoias.
For the superstitious, however, this
might be interpreted as a bad sign. Al
most every set-up that has come Stan
ford's way this year has arrived at the
moment of rally. The Sagehens were
supposed to roll over and play dead at
the sight of a red jersev when they
came here this fall, and, instead, they
almost returned to Nevada with the
Cardinal scalp under their belts. As it
was, the Reno team got all of the glory
and most of the money.
St. Ignatius was another squad which
hit the campus under a cloud of disfa
vor. The bleachers were moved to pity
for the poor boys who were in for such
a beating before the very eyes of Glenn
Warner. What the Pittsburgh coach
saw made it look bad for the confessed
dopester.
The best of guarding can't keep out
every long shot and there are sure, to
be fouls. If the inaccuracy in basket
shooting reoccurs with the midgets and
their passing is intercepted with the
regularity that it was stopped in the
last game, there is a good chance for
any fighting five to down them.
Coach Young has been working the
same men together who started the first
game. This means that unless Kitou
is replaced by Koba, he and Meyers
will probably start the action in the for
ward positions. Hogle is the likely man
for center. There seems no good rea
son that Young should coach from the
bench, so he will no dobt play running
guard himself as there is no other strong
contender for the job. Captain Silviera
will play under the basket.
Four more certain games arc. on the
lightweight schedule and three hang in
the balance. Manager J. B. Sansone
hopes to rake a contest with the Olym
pic Club out of the fire next Tuesday,
but as yet has no definite announcement
to make.
The Lowell game will start at 7:15.
