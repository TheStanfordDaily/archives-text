# CALIFORNIA CHANGES STADIUM PLANS; MAY ADOPT STANFORD TYPE
## 
### 
The University of California is seri
ously considering changing all the plans
for their stadium because of the exces
sive expense involved in purchasing the
privately-owned ground next to the U.
C. campus. They are considering build
ing a structure "patterned somewhat
after the Stanford stadium." This de
cision became known this morning fol
lowing a meeting of the board of re
gents at Berkeley.
The new location chosen will prob
ably be up in Strawberry Canon, back
of the California campus. The ground
here is owned by the university, so that
half a million would be lopped off the
expenses by this plan. Abandonment of
the. concrete type of stadium will, it is
estimated, save California two-thirds of
the cost, and a vear or more in time.
