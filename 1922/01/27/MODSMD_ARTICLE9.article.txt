# STANFORD BABES TO PLAY LOWELL
## Freshman Court Team and High School Five to Meet Tomorrow Night in Pavilion 
### 
Lowell High School is scheduled to
play the freshman team in the Pavilion
Saturday night at 8:30.
With a defeat by both Oakland Tech
and Commerce High chalked against
them, the Lowell team is not con
sidered as dangerous. The men are
small and not particularly fast.
Coach Seav drilled the squad for
the entire period last night in shoot
ing baskets and in advancing the ball
down the floor. Inaccuracy in mak
ing baskets is the weak point of the
Babe team.
Hoffman was 011 the floor last night,
but will be unable to play Saturday,
as his knee is still too weak. Next
week Coach Seay is planning to use
Hoffman and Alexander at guard, leav
ing Hooper for the running guard po
sition, with Shipke as substitute.
Alexander, Hooper, forward; Steele,
center; and Oliva and Shipke, guards,
is the combination that Coach Seay
will probably start against Lowell, to
morrow.
