# VARSITY DROPS SECOND GAME 10 AGGIES
## Scoring Machine of Northern Team Plays Havoc With Card Offense and Defense 
### 
Individual efforts of the ten members
of the Stanford varsity basketball squad
could not cope with the polished team
work and superior playing of the Ore
gon Aggies quintet last Friday and Sat
urday nights at Corvallis.
Ihe Aggies successfully defended
their home territory, 37-24, and 25-1-1,
and sent the Cardinals back to Califor
nia with the record of wto games won
and two games lost on their northern
invasion.
'Mush Hjelte, O. A. C.'s giant cen
ter, aided more or less by Stinson at
forward, was the man that put the skids
under the Cardinal machine in both con
tests. In the first game Hjelte had lit
tle difficulty in breaking through the
Stanford defense. His total for the
evening was nineteen points. In the
final contest, Van Gent set his men to
watch the tall center, which they did
very efficiently, but while they were
doing it Stinson rang up twelve of the.
twenty-four points for the Aggies.

Davies Stars in Opener

Little Jimmy Davies struck his stride
in the first meeting of the two games
on Friday night. It was practically a
case of the Cardinal skipper versus the
Aggie five, including Hjelte. Davies
contributed ten points of the. twenty
four for Stanford, and played a bang
up game on tht defense. Mcllosc found
it harder going against the O. A. C.
guards, Ross and Richards, than at Eu
gene in the first of the week, and only
threw three goals from field.
Dick Richmond made the most sen
sational shots of the contest, looping
two into the basket from mid-court.

Game Is Rough

From the start the game developed
into a hard-fought battle, and many
fouls wert called by Referee ColeiTian.
Bob Janssen drew four personals in the
first fifteen minutes of play, and had to
be relieved by Howell.
At halftime the score was 21-11 in fa
vor of the Aggies. The individual play
ing of Hjelte and the strong defense of
"Red" Rutherford's aggregation was
clearly besting the efforts of the smaller
Stanford quintet. Van Gent made a
complete change in his line-up. One by
one the first string five went out, and
Howell, Anderson, Pitts, Campbell, and
Cleaveland took up the burden. The
substitutes fared worse than tlit first
five, Cleaveland being the only one to
make any points.
Stanford held the Aggies better in
the final period, finding the basket for
thirteen points, and holding the Beavers
to eighteen.

Second Game Is Closer

The final contest on Saturday night
was more or less of a repetion of the
preceding one, save that the Cardinals
held the Aggie forwards to six field
goals. Thirteen of the winner's points
came from free throws.
Hjelte did little perceptible damage,
beyond drawing the Cardinal defense
away from the O. A. C. forwards, and
he had to be content with one field goal
and three free throws. Stinson led the
field in scoring with twelve points.
Van Gent's quintet played a purely
defensive game from start to finish. The
Cardinal points were evenly distributed,
Davies leading with six.
Pitts started for McHose at forward,
but was soon replaced by the latter.
Campbell was the only other Cardinal
substitute to break into the game.

Bruins Downed Twice

While the Aggies were handing the
Cardinal quintet the two defeats, the
Sundodging Vikings from the University
of Washington practically put the Cali
fornia five out of the running for the
Conference championship.
The tirst game at Seattle, was a heart

breaker, with the Bruins leading till the
final minute when Si elk made hi> first
basket, winning the battle tor Wash
ington, 34-33.
The final fray proved Washington'-
superiority. The Vikings won, 28-22.
and they led lite southerners at half
time, 17-9.
Dispatches from the North declare
that "Windy" Crawford of Washington
had a marked advantage over Captain
Eggleston of the Blue and Gold.
