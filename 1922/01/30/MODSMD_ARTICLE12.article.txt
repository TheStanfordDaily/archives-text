# 'SUCCESS OF DRIVE TEST OF STANFORD IDEALS'-DAN EVANS
## 
### 
There is only one Vale, there is only
one- Harvard, there is only one Stan
ford. Each has its traditions, its ideals,
and its own high standards which it be
stows 011 those who are marked with
its name. They ask nothing in return
but appreciation, devotion, and a will
ingness to assist in passing on those
same gifts to others.

Those of us who have choscn to bear
the mark of Stanford arc being called
upon to express this appreciation in a
tangible form. We have it, we must
have it —unless we are devoid of all bin
selfish instincts or unless these great
gifts which some of us have received,
and which some of lis are receiving,
mean nothing to us or have failed in
their mission; if we do not express this
appreciation, then the outside world will
he justified in believing that the Uni
versity is a failure.
The conclusion is inevitable; the en
dowment is our ordeal. Should it fail
on the campus, should it fail with the
alumni, then either we have failed to
learn the primary lesson of Love and
Understanding, or the magnificent dream
of I lie Stanfords is, after all, only ;i
dream and has never become a reality.
Should it succeed, that success will her
ald 'to all the devotion of the Stanford
family to the common Mother, and will
justify the existence and the mission of
the University. Its failure is the failure
of all. its success the success of all.
