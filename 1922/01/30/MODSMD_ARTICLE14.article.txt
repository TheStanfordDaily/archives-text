# Stanford's Biggest Task
## 
### 
1 he campaign which is being launched here today
for the purpose of raising three million dollars to
provide for the growth and expansion of Stanford
University has been characterized as "the biggest
single task ever undertaken by Stanford." That
should not disturb any one, because we have demon
strated during'the year just closed that we are ca
pable of doing big things. The way in which the
athletic stadium was built has characterized Stan
ford as a place where people know how to do things.
Reasons why more money is needed are generally
well known. If the University is to continue to grow
and to perform the functions which its founders had
in mind it must have money. The original endow
ment has, after thirty years, proved to be inadequate
to care for the necessary expansion. The inadequacy
of the original endowment has been heightened by
the change in the value of money caused by the
late world war. The need for immediate endowment
is a real and immediate one.
Stanford students have asked to start the campaign
by raising the first $200,(X)0. We, here at Stanford,
realize better than the alumni the need for more
money. The present undergraduate body and stu
dents in the years to come will benefit directly from
the growth of the University. Therefore, it is proper
that the campaign should receive its birth here.
There are always persons who throw up their
hands and stand aghast at the mention of a campaign
or drive. Their defense is, "We pay for everything
we get here; let those who follow us pay their own
way."
But do we pay for everything we get here? Can
an education be measured in terms of money? Do
we, in our secret hearts, regard securing an educa
tion in the same way as we do the purchase of a new
pair of shoes? It is not probable that a single one
of us looks upon his college career from such a mer
cenary standpoint.
We are fortunate in being students of Stanford
University rather than of some other institution.
Here in this garden spot we go on our way acquir
ing knowledge, making friends, and living upon the
store of rich precedent and experience left by the
people who have finished before us. \\ e profit by
the experiences of the administration and.the faculty
and partake of the growth and expansion of Stan
ford. The associations connected with Stanford are
unique to it and are priceless.
It is the intangible, the indefinable aura connected
with acquiring an education in Stanford University
that we are asked to attest that we have by subscrib
ing to the endowment fund. We are not asked to
subscribe above our means, and the terms of the gift
covering a period of five years make it easy for us
to do something for the institution that is doing so
much for us.
We wanted to start this drive because we are here
now. We are on the immediate ground, and the
alumni and friends of the University will look to
our example in shaping their own actions in this cam
paign. If we fail in our quota the entire campaign
will suffer in its consummation, but if we respond in
the way that we should the success of the campaign
will I>e assured.

that we are asked to attest that we have by subscrib
ing to the endowment fund. We are not asked to
subscribe above our means, and the terms of the gift
covering a period of five years make it easy for us
to do something for the institution that is doing so
much for us.
We wanted to start this drive because we are here
now. We are on the immediate ground, and the
alumni and friends of the University will look to
our example in shaping their own actions in this cam
paign. If we fail in our quota the entire campaign
will suffer in its consummation, but if we respond in
the way that we should the success of the campaign
will I>e assured.
1 he campaign which is being launched here today
for the purpose of raising three million dollars to
provide for the growth and expansion of Stanford
University has been characterized as "the biggest
single task ever undertaken by Stanford." That
should not disturb any one, because we have demon
strated during'the year just closed that we are ca
pable of doing big things. The way in which the
athletic stadium was built has characterized Stan
ford as a place where people know how to do things.
Reasons why more money is needed are generally
well known. If the University is to continue to grow
and to perform the functions which its founders had
in mind it must have money. The original endow
ment has, after thirty years, proved to be inadequate
to care for the necessary expansion. The inadequacy
of the original endowment has been heightened by
the change in the value of money caused by the
late world war. The need for immediate endowment
is a real and immediate one.
Stanford students have asked to start the campaign
by raising the first $200,(X)0. We, here at Stanford,
realize better than the alumni the need for more
money. The present undergraduate body and stu
dents in the years to come will benefit directly from
the growth of the University. Therefore, it is proper
that the campaign should receive its birth here.
There are always persons who throw up their
hands and stand aghast at the mention of a campaign
or drive. Their defense is, "We pay for everything
we get here; let those who follow us pay their own
way."
But do we pay for everything we get here? Can
an education be measured in terms of money? Do
we, in our secret hearts, regard securing an educa
tion in the same way as we do the purchase of a new
pair of shoes? It is not probable that a single one
of us looks upon his college career from such a mer
cenary standpoint.
We are fortunate in being students of Stanford
University rather than of some other institution.
Here in this garden spot we go on our way acquir
ing knowledge, making friends, and living upon the
store of rich precedent and experience left by the
people who have finished before us. \\ e profit by
the experiences of the administration and.the faculty
and partake of the growth and expansion of Stan
ford. The associations connected with Stanford are
unique to it and are priceless.
It is the intangible, the indefinable aura connected
with acquiring an education in Stanford University
that we are asked to attest that we have by subscrib
ing to the endowment fund. We are not asked to
subscribe above our means, and the terms of the gift
covering a period of five years make it easy for us
