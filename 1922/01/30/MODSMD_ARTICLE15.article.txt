# Making and Undertaking

Judging by external appearances, California stock
ranked high beside Stanford's last spring when the
two universities launched campaigns for stadium
funds. California was to have a huge structure cost
ing anywhere from one to five millions. Stantoid
was to be satisfied with one equally large, but not so
beautiful in design, costing about three-quarters of a
million. Today. Stanford has achieved her aim at

less than a third of the estimated cost. California
has raised a million dollars and has no place to build
a stadium. Until she does, all the Big Games will
he played on Stanford territory.
California's Stadium Committee has found that
the site originally proposed will cost upward of half
a million dollars. Cooperation and support of Berke
ley people and the property owners directly affected
was expected. However, both legal and financial
difficulties are brought about by a distinctly different
attitude on the part of the property owners. And
the townspeople do not seem to think that the stadium
tvill be much of an asset to the community, at least on
the proposed site. The Stadium Committee has de
cided that the entire million must be used for the
structure itself. Evidently, the cost of the site was
expected to be small. Stanford is indeed fortunate
in that a site was provided before attempts were
made to construct the bowl.
Strawberry Canyon, situated back of the Greek
Theatre on the California campys, has been chosen
by the Stadium Committee as the best location for
the structure if it is found impossible to build nearer
the university. A stadium similar in design to Stan
ford's would be necessary, however, to conform to
the lay of the land. It is thought that the natural
depression formed by the canyon will save money
in excavation. In this case, since Stanford's stadium
cost only $200,000, California's should be a great
deal cheaper. 1f it were not, there would be at least
$800,000 left for improvements.
The permanence of California's proposed concrete
stadium as opposed, to Stanford's temporary struc
ture was one of the talking points of the State Uni
versity's campaign. If they model it after Stanford's
they will not have conformed to the promises made
in securing funds. California, in changing the site,
must now change the stadium to conform to the
site as well as to the amount of money available.
Perhaps those who bought admission to athletic
games in the future will not care to see the funds
appropriated for the construction of an athletic play
ground made from mere dirt. Ihe Stanford Board
of Athletic Control was wise in paving the way
for an unbroken finish by campaigning for funds
without hampering strings attached.
Where Stanford had $200,000, she now has a
stadium. California has enough money for live such
stadiums. What Stanford started less than a year
ago was finished last November. \\ hen the site sit
uation has been attended to, California will have
started. Stanford is justified in congratulating her
self on having averted unfortunate difficulties.

a stadium. Until she does, all the Big Games will
he played on Stanford territory.
California's Stadium Committee has found that
the site originally proposed will cost upward of half
a million dollars. Cooperation and support of Berke
ley people and the property owners directly affected
was expected. However, both legal and financial
difficulties are brought about by a distinctly different
attitude on the part of the property owners. And
the townspeople do not seem to think that the stadium
tvill be much of an asset to the community, at least on
the proposed site. The Stadium Committee has de
cided that the entire million must be used for the
structure itself. Evidently, the cost of the site was
expected to be small. Stanford is indeed fortunate
in that a site was provided before attempts were
made to construct the bowl.
Strawberry Canyon, situated back of the Greek
Theatre on the California campys, has been chosen
by the Stadium Committee as the best location for
the structure if it is found impossible to build nearer
the university. A stadium similar in design to Stan
ford's would be necessary, however, to conform to
the lay of the land. It is thought that the natural
depression formed by the canyon will save money
in excavation. In this case, since Stanford's stadium
cost only $200,000, California's should be a great
deal cheaper. 1f it were not, there would be at least
$800,000 left for improvements.
The permanence of California's proposed concrete
stadium as opposed, to Stanford's temporary struc
ture was one of the talking points of the State Uni
versity's campaign. If they model it after Stanford's
they will not have conformed to the promises made
in securing funds. California, in changing the site,
must now change the stadium to conform to the
site as well as to the amount of money available.
Perhaps those who bought admission to athletic
games in the future will not care to see the funds
appropriated for the construction of an athletic play
ground made from mere dirt. Ihe Stanford Board
of Athletic Control was wise in paving the way
for an unbroken finish by campaigning for funds
without hampering strings attached.
Where Stanford had $200,000, she now has a
stadium. California has enough money for live such
stadiums. What Stanford started less than a year
ago was finished last November. \\ hen the site sit
uation has been attended to, California will have
started. Stanford is justified in congratulating her
self on having averted unfortunate difficulties.
Judging by external appearances, California stock
ranked high beside Stanford's last spring when the
two universities launched campaigns for stadium
funds. California was to have a huge structure cost
ing anywhere from one to five millions. Stantoid
was to be satisfied with one equally large, but not so
beautiful in design, costing about three-quarters of a
million. Today. Stanford has achieved her aim at

less than a third of the estimated cost. California
has raised a million dollars and has no place to build
a stadium. Until she does, all the Big Games will
he played on Stanford territory.
