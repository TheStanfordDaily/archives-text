"Seay Makes Slash in Diamond Squad." Then right
below it, comes the deck of the headline: "Green and
lioughty 011 List of Injured." We would suggest, purely
from a patriotic point of view, that the coach be more

Now this, of course, is the Endowment No., and as no
such No. is complete without endorsements from the
great as well as from the near-great, Cabbages offers
opinion culled from various sources of great importance.
Read these and see if you can keep your money in your

"Personally, I think this money-raising scheme is n
great idea. 1 tried to raise my rent the other day, but
my landlady beat me to it. I'm heart and soul with the

"I'm just as willing to give my spare money to this
as to the Salvation Army. They wouldn't give me any
thing once when I was hungry. They told me to go to
a White Lunch, and I never felt so insulted in all my
life. What's that. Oh, yes, you can have my best
wishes. The bank has declared war on my checks" —

But this is making fun of a serious subject, and it's
not well to do that, as King Louis XIV remarked when
they brought a peasent in to be beheaded. Read the
"Other Viewpoint" if you want anything really humorous
any day.
