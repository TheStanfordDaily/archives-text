# EDITOR OF CHAPPIE URGES LIBERALITY IN SHEKEL SHOWER
## 
### 
Now that something new under the
sun has at last appeared and students
are enjoying the. absolute novelty of be
ing asked for money, Chappie believes
in making it a major sport. Despite
the fact that the Bookstore pays divi-

(lends regularly and the oranges from
the orange trees by the English Build
ing are sold fur prolit, Stanford needs
some money and Chappie wants to see
her get it.
A luxury tax on Library queeners
would be illegal, and so a direct appeal
is being made.. "The Lord helps them
that helps themselves," opines the Old
Boy, and if the people here on the cam
pus show their willingness to do their
part, the world will be a lot more likely
to give them a hand. All together boys
â€”shower down the shekels!
