# Panhellenic Head Urges Repayment of Benefits
## 
### 
To repeat a trite saying, we should
give as well as receive. In the case of
the endowment fund, this means that we
should attempt to repay to the best of
our ability some of the many benefits
we have received from the University
as Stanford students. It is not too much

to expect that we should contribute to
our education, when we consider that
the very existence of this institution de
pends, almost, upon such contributions.
To give, and to give generously, is both
our duty and our privelege.

President, Panhellenic Association
