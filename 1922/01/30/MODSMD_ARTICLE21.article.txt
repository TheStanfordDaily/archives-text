# Undergraduates Will Put Over Campaign Says Wayne Sarcka
## 
### 
I am asked to answer the questions.
"What will the undergraduates do in
the endowment fund campaign?" and
"What do you think they ought to do?"
The two are answered in one. I be
lieve Stanford will do what she ought
to do.
Like everyone else coming here for
the first time, I am deeply impressed
with the unusual, shall I say extraor
dinary privileges, students here enjoy
over those of other similar institutions
in this country. They really have some
thing to crow about.
In assuming a quota of $200,000, the
student leaders at least, seem to real
ize the seriousness of the financial sit
uation which confronts the University.
Once the undergraduate body thoroughly
understands just why the appeal for
help at this time and how they can help
by doing something really big, I am
sanguine that the spirit of sacrifice in
them born of devotion, will respond in
proportion to the privilege that is theirs
as Stanford men and women.
WAYNE A. SARCKA.
Assistant Director of Campaign.
