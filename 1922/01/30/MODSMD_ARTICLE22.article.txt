### 
"The University lias established, with
out a reasonable doubt, that money is
needed. No pe.rson who has spent any

time under the, red-tiled roofs of Stan
ford can fail to respond to this call for
aid, for there is not one of us who does
not feel deeply that Stanford must al
ways continue to be the great college of
the West â€”complete and well equippe/1
in every department.
