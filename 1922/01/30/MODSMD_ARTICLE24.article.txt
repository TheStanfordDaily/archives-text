# RUGBY TEAM PRAISED IN LETTER TO WILBUR
## 
### 
A letter was recently received by
President Wilbur from the president of
the Vancouver Rugby Football Union
which shows very clearly the reputation
the Stanford rugby team made for itself
and its University while on its trip into
Canada last Christmas vacation. It also
explains the conditions under which the
Cardinal team played its three games.
The letter follows:
Dr. R. L. Wilbur,
President of Stanford University.
Dear Sir:
I had intended before this, to tell you
how much we again appreciated having
your rugby enthusiasts with us this
Christmas.
While we were perhaps fortunate in
carrying away the honors and while the
class of rugby now played in British
Columbia is, if anything, slightly better
than last year, I still feel that the final
results we.re not a true indication as to
the merits of the respective teams and
had the weather been favorable and a
dry ground possible. I am satisfied the
result might have been very different.
This is clearly demonstrated by their
recently so decisively defeating a team
from the H. M. S. Raleigh for which 1
offer my hearty congratulations.
It is most unfortunate that the. good
old game has not a larger following in
the South and that the proposed visit
to California by our local university
team was not possible this year tinder
existing conditions. It was very gratify
ing to have Mr. Maloney tell us that
you were all determined to keep the
game alive in Stanford University at
least, and to know that you were per
sonally so interested. It is our sincere
hope and desire that conditions next
year will permit such arrangements being
carricd out.
In the face of what seemed a hope
less proposition on account of the con
tinued hard frost the latter half of De
cember, we decided to ask your boys to
come North, knowing full well what it
would mean to rugby with you if the
series had been cancelled. 1 am sure
Mr. Maloney and your players now
fully realize and appreciate the difficul
ties with which we had to contend at
the and although we find ourselves
several hundred dollars behind on' the
series we may consider ourselves ufi
der the circumstances exceedingly for
tunate.
In conclusion, without hesitation, 1
must say that again your boys, both on
and off the field, proved themselves true
sportsmen and gentlemen, and 1 am sure
that next year they will be welcomed
with open arms by the many new and
old friends they left behind. _
With all sincere good wishes for the
coming year, 1 beg to remain,
Yours faithfully.
GEORGE P. ISHAM.

A letter was recently received by
President Wilbur from the president of
the Vancouver Rugby Football Union
which shows very clearly the reputation
the Stanford rugby team made for itself
and its University while on its trip into
Canada last Christmas vacation. It also
explains the conditions under which the
Cardinal team played its three games.
The letter follows:
Dr. R. L. Wilbur,
President of Stanford University.
Dear Sir:
I had intended before this, to tell you
how much we again appreciated having
your rugby enthusiasts with us this
Christmas.
While we were perhaps fortunate in
carrying away the honors and while the
class of rugby now played in British
Columbia is, if anything, slightly better
than last year, I still feel that the final
results we.re not a true indication as to
the merits of the respective teams and
had the weather been favorable and a
dry ground possible. I am satisfied the
result might have been very different.
This is clearly demonstrated by their
recently so decisively defeating a team
from the H. M. S. Raleigh for which 1
offer my hearty congratulations.
It is most unfortunate that the. good
old game has not a larger following in
the South and that the proposed visit
to California by our local university
team was not possible this year tinder
existing conditions. It was very gratify
ing to have Mr. Maloney tell us that
you were all determined to keep the
game alive in Stanford University at
least, and to know that you were per
sonally so interested. It is our sincere
hope and desire that conditions next
year will permit such arrangements being
carricd out.
In the face of what seemed a hope
less proposition on account of the con
tinued hard frost the latter half of De
cember, we decided to ask your boys to
come North, knowing full well what it
would mean to rugby with you if the
series had been cancelled. 1 am sure
Mr. Maloney and your players now
fully realize and appreciate the difficul
ties with which we had to contend at
the and although we find ourselves
several hundred dollars behind on' the
series we may consider ourselves ufi
der the circumstances exceedingly for
tunate.
In conclusion, without hesitation, 1
must say that again your boys, both on
and off the field, proved themselves true
sportsmen and gentlemen, and 1 am sure
that next year they will be welcomed
with open arms by the many new and
old friends they left behind. _
With all sincere good wishes for the
coming year, 1 beg to remain,
Yours faithfully.
GEORGE P. ISHAM.
