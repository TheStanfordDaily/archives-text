# APPEAL NOT LIMITED SAYS MARY MATTHEWS
## 
### 
During the last few years we have
been asked to contribute in a great many
different campaigns. Although there
were always some students who re
sponded, the appeal was in each case
limitexl to those who had a particular
interest in that cause. But we are all
interested in seeing a larger and better
Stanford. We can all "pull together" in
this and .forgetting the division of in
terest between men and women, or be-

twecn living groups, work as a unit for
a common aim. Success means a greater
Stanford, not merely in material wealth,
but in the growth of that intangible, yet
invaluable attribute known as the "Stan
ford Spirit."
