# Student Support Is Challenge to Alumni Response
## CAMPUS ENDOWMENT CAMPAIGN STARTS AT BIG ASSEMBLY TODAY 
### 
Stanford's student support will form the first challenge
to go out to the alumni and friends of the University for their
support in the move for a three million dollar endowment
fund. This was the outstanding statement made in regard to
the campaign on the campus which was opened at a student
assembly held this morning at 9 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
"I envy the student of today,'' said President Wilbur, the
opening speaker at the assembly. "He has a chance to serve,

in which there is no obligation but that of love for Stanford."
President Wilbur outlined the problems which have led up
to the present need for the endowment and touched upon the
institution from its beginning, thirty years ago. up to the present standing as ;
the leading endowed university west of Chicago.
The resources left to the University by the Stanfords have been utilized
to the extent that only two undeveloped sources of financial aid remain, the
Palo Alto Stock Farm, which does not offer any immediate return and the
Stanford family and the public, according to President Wilbur. It. is to this
last that the University must look if it is to continue to build up and progress.
"The business of a. University is to experiment." This quotation from Dr.
Pordan, President Wilbur gave as the aim of a progressive institution. "We
must view it as a going concern and look ahead to the University it will be in
the future," he said. "The general attitude on the outside is that Stanford !
is a rich institution and it is this belief which we must correct. Every stu-1

(lent can make himself a center of in- j
formation and convey to the public the [
true need of the University."
President Wilbur told of a similar j
time in early days of the institution j
when Dr. Jordan struggled to keep it j
alive with only the most meagre fi- j
nancial aid. "We who were here in !
those days of struggle love the Univer- j
sity more today because we did some-!
thing for it, and you men and women !
here today have that same chance,"!
he concluded.
The financial side of the endowment j
program was explained by Comptroller i
Roth. "This will be the first instance
ir which money has been given as a
permanent endowment. The first great
need, to which the student contribu
tions will be turned," he said. "It is !
the first million for faculty salaries, i
The action of the General Education j
Board in pledging $300,000 toward this |
sum when the remainder is raised is |
proof that such an addition is abso-1
lntely necessary to maintain the pres-1
ent standards of the institution."
The second million will go into!
buildings for the departments where!
the need is the greatest. The pro- j
posed plan includes a building for the |
law department and its library, which [
is not at present in a fireproof struc- j
ture; a building for the biological de-j
partment which has in its possession j
many valuable collections; dormitori-1
en to care for the 4SO men students
who have no living accommodations
0:1 the campus, and a new gymnasium
for the women of the campus. The
third million will be used for the main
tenance and expansion of the medical
school in San Francisco and it is ex
pected that most of the support for it

"The present increased tuition," con
tinued Roth, "cares only for the pres
ent functions of the University, and
can in no way meet these increased
demands."
"It is the reaction of the younger
members of a family to a question
that in a large part influences the
response of older members," said Dan
Evans, '20, president of the student
body, in speaking of the influence
which the result of the student cam
paign for the endowment fund will
exercise upon the alumni and friends
of the University. "Our response will
show them what the University means
to us and how far we are willing to
sacrifice ourselves for its good."
Evans described the organization of
the campus campaign by which every
living group will be canvassed, with
a representative appointed to inter
view ten people. Actual work for the
campaign will begin tonight. Reports
will be turned in from the various com
mittees every day and the final results
of the campaign will be announced
on Friday night.
"The organization cannot be entirely
complete," said Evans, "and its suc
cess is dependent mainly upon, the co
operation of every member of the stu
dent body in seeing that every person
on the campus is reached during the
campaign tlys week."

"The present increased tuition," con
tinued Roth, "cares only for the pres
ent functions of the University, and
can in no way meet these increased
demands."
"It is the reaction of the younger
members of a family to a question
that in a large part influences the
response of older members," said Dan
Evans, '20, president of the student
body, in speaking of the influence
which the result of the student cam
paign for the endowment fund will
exercise upon the alumni and friends
of the University. "Our response will
show them what the University means
to us and how far we are willing to
sacrifice ourselves for its good."
Evans described the organization of
the campus campaign by which every
living group will be canvassed, with
a representative appointed to inter
view ten people. Actual work for the
campaign will begin tonight. Reports
will be turned in from the various com
mittees every day and the final results
of the campaign will be announced
on Friday night.
"The organization cannot be entirely
complete," said Evans, "and its suc
cess is dependent mainly upon, the co
operation of every member of the stu
dent body in seeing that every person
on the campus is reached during the
campaign tlys week."

Stanford's student support will form the first challenge
to go out to the alumni and friends of the University for their
support in the move for a three million dollar endowment
fund. This was the outstanding statement made in regard to
the campaign on the campus which was opened at a student
assembly held this morning at 9 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
"I envy the student of today,'' said President Wilbur, the
opening speaker at the assembly. "He has a chance to serve,

in which there is no obligation but that of love for Stanford."
President Wilbur outlined the problems which have led up
to the present need for the endowment and touched upon the
institution from its beginning, thirty years ago. up to the present standing as ;
the leading endowed university west of Chicago.
The resources left to the University by the Stanfords have been utilized
to the extent that only two undeveloped sources of financial aid remain, the
Palo Alto Stock Farm, which does not offer any immediate return and the
Stanford family and the public, according to President Wilbur. It. is to this
last that the University must look if it is to continue to build up and progress.
"The business of a. University is to experiment." This quotation from Dr.
Pordan, President Wilbur gave as the aim of a progressive institution. "We
must view it as a going concern and look ahead to the University it will be in
the future," he said. "The general attitude on the outside is that Stanford !
is a rich institution and it is this belief which we must correct. Every stu-1

(lent can make himself a center of in- j
formation and convey to the public the [
true need of the University."
President Wilbur told of a similar j
time in early days of the institution j
when Dr. Jordan struggled to keep it j
alive with only the most meagre fi- j
nancial aid. "We who were here in !
those days of struggle love the Univer- j
sity more today because we did some-!
thing for it, and you men and women !
here today have that same chance,"!
he concluded.
The financial side of the endowment j
program was explained by Comptroller i
Roth. "This will be the first instance
ir which money has been given as a
permanent endowment. The first great
need, to which the student contribu
tions will be turned," he said. "It is !
the first million for faculty salaries, i
The action of the General Education j
Board in pledging $300,000 toward this |
sum when the remainder is raised is |
proof that such an addition is abso-1
lntely necessary to maintain the pres-1
ent standards of the institution."
The second million will go into!
buildings for the departments where!
the need is the greatest. The pro- j
posed plan includes a building for the |
law department and its library, which [
is not at present in a fireproof struc- j
ture; a building for the biological de-j
partment which has in its possession j
many valuable collections; dormitori-1
en to care for the 4SO men students
who have no living accommodations
0:1 the campus, and a new gymnasium
for the women of the campus. The
third million will be used for the main
tenance and expansion of the medical
school in San Francisco and it is ex
pected that most of the support for it

Stanford's student support will form the first challenge
to go out to the alumni and friends of the University for their
support in the move for a three million dollar endowment
fund. This was the outstanding statement made in regard to
the campaign on the campus which was opened at a student
assembly held this morning at 9 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
"I envy the student of today,'' said President Wilbur, the
opening speaker at the assembly. "He has a chance to serve,

in which there is no obligation but that of love for Stanford."
President Wilbur outlined the problems which have led up
to the present need for the endowment and touched upon the
institution from its beginning, thirty years ago. up to the present standing as ;
the leading endowed university west of Chicago.
The resources left to the University by the Stanfords have been utilized
to the extent that only two undeveloped sources of financial aid remain, the
Palo Alto Stock Farm, which does not offer any immediate return and the
Stanford family and the public, according to President Wilbur. It. is to this
last that the University must look if it is to continue to build up and progress.
"The business of a. University is to experiment." This quotation from Dr.
Pordan, President Wilbur gave as the aim of a progressive institution. "We
must view it as a going concern and look ahead to the University it will be in
the future," he said. "The general attitude on the outside is that Stanford !
is a rich institution and it is this belief which we must correct. Every stu-1

(lent can make himself a center of in- j
formation and convey to the public the [
true need of the University."
President Wilbur told of a similar j
time in early days of the institution j
when Dr. Jordan struggled to keep it j
alive with only the most meagre fi- j
nancial aid. "We who were here in !
those days of struggle love the Univer- j
sity more today because we did some-!
thing for it, and you men and women !
here today have that same chance,"!
he concluded.
The financial side of the endowment j
program was explained by Comptroller i
Roth. "This will be the first instance
ir which money has been given as a
permanent endowment. The first great
need, to which the student contribu
tions will be turned," he said. "It is !
the first million for faculty salaries, i
The action of the General Education j
Board in pledging $300,000 toward this |
sum when the remainder is raised is |
proof that such an addition is abso-1
lntely necessary to maintain the pres-1
ent standards of the institution."
The second million will go into!
buildings for the departments where!
the need is the greatest. The pro- j
posed plan includes a building for the |
law department and its library, which [
is not at present in a fireproof struc- j
ture; a building for the biological de-j
partment which has in its possession j
many valuable collections; dormitori-1
en to care for the 4SO men students
who have no living accommodations
0:1 the campus, and a new gymnasium
for the women of the campus. The
third million will be used for the main
tenance and expansion of the medical
school in San Francisco and it is ex
pected that most of the support for it

"The present increased tuition," con
tinued Roth, "cares only for the pres
ent functions of the University, and
can in no way meet these increased
demands."
"It is the reaction of the younger
members of a family to a question
that in a large part influences the
response of older members," said Dan
Evans, '20, president of the student
body, in speaking of the influence
which the result of the student cam
paign for the endowment fund will
exercise upon the alumni and friends
of the University. "Our response will
show them what the University means
to us and how far we are willing to
sacrifice ourselves for its good."
Evans described the organization of
the campus campaign by which every
living group will be canvassed, with
a representative appointed to inter
view ten people. Actual work for the
campaign will begin tonight. Reports
will be turned in from the various com
mittees every day and the final results
of the campaign will be announced
on Friday night.
"The organization cannot be entirely
complete," said Evans, "and its suc
cess is dependent mainly upon, the co
operation of every member of the stu
dent body in seeing that every person
on the campus is reached during the
campaign tlys week."

Stanford's student support will form the first challenge
to go out to the alumni and friends of the University for their
support in the move for a three million dollar endowment
fund. This was the outstanding statement made in regard to
the campaign on the campus which was opened at a student
assembly held this morning at 9 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
"I envy the student of today,'' said President Wilbur, the
opening speaker at the assembly. "He has a chance to serve,

in which there is no obligation but that of love for Stanford."
President Wilbur outlined the problems which have led up
to the present need for the endowment and touched upon the
institution from its beginning, thirty years ago. up to the present standing as ;
the leading endowed university west of Chicago.
The resources left to the University by the Stanfords have been utilized
to the extent that only two undeveloped sources of financial aid remain, the
Palo Alto Stock Farm, which does not offer any immediate return and the
Stanford family and the public, according to President Wilbur. It. is to this
last that the University must look if it is to continue to build up and progress.
"The business of a. University is to experiment." This quotation from Dr.
Pordan, President Wilbur gave as the aim of a progressive institution. "We
must view it as a going concern and look ahead to the University it will be in
the future," he said. "The general attitude on the outside is that Stanford !
is a rich institution and it is this belief which we must correct. Every stu-1

(lent can make himself a center of in- j
formation and convey to the public the [
true need of the University."
President Wilbur told of a similar j
time in early days of the institution j
when Dr. Jordan struggled to keep it j
alive with only the most meagre fi- j
nancial aid. "We who were here in !
those days of struggle love the Univer- j
sity more today because we did some-!
thing for it, and you men and women !
here today have that same chance,"!
he concluded.
The financial side of the endowment j
program was explained by Comptroller i
Roth. "This will be the first instance
ir which money has been given as a
permanent endowment. The first great
need, to which the student contribu
tions will be turned," he said. "It is !
the first million for faculty salaries, i
The action of the General Education j
Board in pledging $300,000 toward this |
sum when the remainder is raised is |
proof that such an addition is abso-1
lntely necessary to maintain the pres-1
ent standards of the institution."
The second million will go into!
buildings for the departments where!
the need is the greatest. The pro- j
posed plan includes a building for the |
law department and its library, which [
is not at present in a fireproof struc- j
ture; a building for the biological de-j
partment which has in its possession j
many valuable collections; dormitori-1
en to care for the 4SO men students
who have no living accommodations
0:1 the campus, and a new gymnasium
for the women of the campus. The
third million will be used for the main
tenance and expansion of the medical
school in San Francisco and it is ex
pected that most of the support for it

"The present increased tuition," con
tinued Roth, "cares only for the pres
ent functions of the University, and
can in no way meet these increased
demands."
"It is the reaction of the younger
members of a family to a question
that in a large part influences the
response of older members," said Dan
Evans, '20, president of the student
body, in speaking of the influence
which the result of the student cam
paign for the endowment fund will
exercise upon the alumni and friends
of the University. "Our response will
show them what the University means
to us and how far we are willing to
sacrifice ourselves for its good."
Evans described the organization of
the campus campaign by which every
living group will be canvassed, with
a representative appointed to inter
view ten people. Actual work for the
campaign will begin tonight. Reports
will be turned in from the various com
mittees every day and the final results
of the campaign will be announced
on Friday night.
"The organization cannot be entirely
complete," said Evans, "and its suc
cess is dependent mainly upon, the co
operation of every member of the stu
dent body in seeing that every person
on the campus is reached during the
campaign tlys week."

"The present increased tuition," con
tinued Roth, "cares only for the pres
ent functions of the University, and
can in no way meet these increased
demands."
"It is the reaction of the younger
members of a family to a question
that in a large part influences the
response of older members," said Dan
Evans, '20, president of the student
body, in speaking of the influence
which the result of the student cam
paign for the endowment fund will
exercise upon the alumni and friends
of the University. "Our response will
show them what the University means
to us and how far we are willing to
sacrifice ourselves for its good."
Evans described the organization of
the campus campaign by which every
living group will be canvassed, with
a representative appointed to inter
view ten people. Actual work for the
campaign will begin tonight. Reports
will be turned in from the various com
mittees every day and the final results
of the campaign will be announced
on Friday night.
"The organization cannot be entirely
complete," said Evans, "and its suc
cess is dependent mainly upon, the co
operation of every member of the stu
dent body in seeing that every person
on the campus is reached during the
campaign tlys week."
