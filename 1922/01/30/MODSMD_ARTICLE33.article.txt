UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eu-

gene, Jan. 27 (P. 1. N. S.)â€”Soccer
may be abandoned at the University of
Oregon unless greater enthusiasm for
the sport is shown. If the team is built
up, games will lie played with O. A. C.
and different Portland teams. Efforts
may also be made to get games with
the Stanford team when they make their
trip North.
