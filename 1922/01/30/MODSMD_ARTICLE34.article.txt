# HEATON WRENN STATES SUPPORT IS NEEDED
## 
### 
This matter of student support in the
endowment campaign is especially ur
gent in the preliminary stages through
which we are now passing on our road
to "The First Million." Actual sup
port, in cash and effort, is needed from

everyone registered at Stanford. Only
by each and every student working
earnestly for the good of the Univer
sity can we hope to realize our ambitions
for a greater Stanford. Organizations
especially should see to it that their
members are awake to the importance
of the situation.
HEATON L. WRENN,
President, Interfraternity Conference.
