# Freshmen Solidly Behind Campaign, Says President
## 
### 
"The freshman class is solidly behind
the campaign for the "First Million for
Stanford." We realize that the future
program of the University can only be
carried out on a sound financial basis.
We realize that the necessary funds can
not be obtained solely from among the.
alumni, but must come partly from the
students to whose benefit it is that Stan
ford's future is assured. We therefore
willingly pledge ourselves to support the
campus campaign, and feel that what we
give can only be a small part of what
we receive from the university."
GILES HALL.
President, Freshman Class.
