# NEED FOR INCREASE IN ENDOWMENT IS RESULT OF UNIVERSITY'S GROWTH
## 
### 
"There Is no prospect from within of the University's meeting Its growing
needs and responsibilities. Not to grow is in part to die. We can fill well
a gradually narrowing field, or we can gain public and aliumtii support and
keep fully abreast of the best."
It is in this statement in the President' report for 1918-19 that the $3,000,-
000 drive upon which Stanford is now launched had its inception.
As long ago as 1913 the trustees and President Wilbur, after a survey of
the situation then and the prospects for the future, made a statement to the
alumni and the public showing that Stanford must have more money if it
was to continue in its growth The war with the general economic upheaval
caused, even further needs Increase In tuition followed but did not bring
sufficient funds for the enlarged program, which included among other things
a readjustment in the salary roll of the colleges of Arts and Sciences, giving
the faculty members adequate compensation, the development of a much
needed water supply, and the addition of certain necessary buildings
When the Board of Trustees asked for an investigation from the General
Education Board, a thorough study of conditions was made Finally the board

found the University's plea to be justi
fied and its aims worthy. Therefore
they agreed to grant $300,000 if the
University could raise an additional
$700,000, the $1,000,000 accruing to go
for increases in professors' salaries.
It was then decided to make the
campaign a real one and in order to
raise the entire sum needed, the goal
was set at $3,000,000.
This action was followed by a con
ference of the presidents of alumni
chapters all over the country and
class secretaries on the campus in De
cember. After going over the situa
tion carefully, the plan for a $3,000 v
000 campaign was endorsed by them.
Lyman L. Pierce, a Stanford man
by adoption was chosen as director for
the campaign. The plans to form from
Stanford men and women a simple
workable organization adequate to
present the Stanford appeal when the
alumni and friends have been duly
listed and informed about Stanford
and its needs.
The unit of organization will be the
group. Each group will be made up
of approximately 100 Stanford men and
women, which can be enlarged to a
possible total of 200 or more by those
within the immediate circle of each
group. In the more popolous communi
ties there will be more than one
group, the San Francisco territory,
consisting of more than ten; Portland,
Oregon .three; New York City, two.
There will be approximately 100 di
visions scattered from the Atlantic to
the Pacific and throughout the world.
Headquarters have already* been
established on the Campus and in
several centers. The campaign has
started among the undergraduat body.
The stages of the campaign to follow
the local drive have been outlined by
Director Pierce as follows:
1. Period of cultivation and prepara
tion. As rapidly as names are placed
upon the list of alumni and friends
which is now being drawn up, carefully
prepared information will be mailed
direct to each person with a view to
thoroughly informing each one as to
the plans and needs of the University.
2. A series of conferences will be
held at the various centers, to be at
tended by representatives of the Uni
versity and leaders of the alumni
bodies for the purpose of informing
each Stanford man and woman of the
plans and methods and for the enlist
ment of their co-operation.
3. These conferences will be follow
ed immediately by the canvass of the
alumni and others whose names have
been suggested and who have been
cultivated to secure in each group the
quota for the group.
The directors will begin with the
University as a center and work out,
canvass not being carried on simul
taneously at all places.

they agreed to grant $300,000 if the
University could raise an additional
$700,000, the $1,000,000 accruing to go
for increases in professors' salaries.
It was then decided to make the
campaign a real one and in order to
raise the entire sum needed, the goal
was set at $3,000,000.
This action was followed by a con
ference of the presidents of alumni
chapters all over the country and
class secretaries on the campus in De
cember. After going over the situa
tion carefully, the plan for a $3,000 v
000 campaign was endorsed by them.
Lyman L. Pierce, a Stanford man
by adoption was chosen as director for
the campaign. The plans to form from
Stanford men and women a simple
workable organization adequate to
present the Stanford appeal when the
alumni and friends have been duly
listed and informed about Stanford
and its needs.
The unit of organization will be the
group. Each group will be made up
of approximately 100 Stanford men and
women, which can be enlarged to a
possible total of 200 or more by those
within the immediate circle of each
group. In the more popolous communi
ties there will be more than one
group, the San Francisco territory,
consisting of more than ten; Portland,
Oregon .three; New York City, two.
There will be approximately 100 di
visions scattered from the Atlantic to
the Pacific and throughout the world.
Headquarters have already* been
established on the Campus and in
several centers. The campaign has
started among the undergraduat body.
The stages of the campaign to follow
the local drive have been outlined by
Director Pierce as follows:
1. Period of cultivation and prepara
tion. As rapidly as names are placed
upon the list of alumni and friends
which is now being drawn up, carefully
prepared information will be mailed
direct to each person with a view to
thoroughly informing each one as to
the plans and needs of the University.
2. A series of conferences will be
held at the various centers, to be at
tended by representatives of the Uni
versity and leaders of the alumni
bodies for the purpose of informing
each Stanford man and woman of the
plans and methods and for the enlist
ment of their co-operation.
3. These conferences will be follow
ed immediately by the canvass of the
alumni and others whose names have
been suggested and who have been
cultivated to secure in each group the
quota for the group.
The directors will begin with the
University as a center and work out,
canvass not being carried on simul
taneously at all places.
"There Is no prospect from within of the University's meeting Its growing
needs and responsibilities. Not to grow is in part to die. We can fill well
a gradually narrowing field, or we can gain public and aliumtii support and
keep fully abreast of the best."
It is in this statement in the President' report for 1918-19 that the $3,000,-
000 drive upon which Stanford is now launched had its inception.
As long ago as 1913 the trustees and President Wilbur, after a survey of
the situation then and the prospects for the future, made a statement to the
alumni and the public showing that Stanford must have more money if it
was to continue in its growth The war with the general economic upheaval
caused, even further needs Increase In tuition followed but did not bring
sufficient funds for the enlarged program, which included among other things
a readjustment in the salary roll of the colleges of Arts and Sciences, giving
the faculty members adequate compensation, the development of a much
needed water supply, and the addition of certain necessary buildings
When the Board of Trustees asked for an investigation from the General
Education Board, a thorough study of conditions was made Finally the board

found the University's plea to be justi
fied and its aims worthy. Therefore
they agreed to grant $300,000 if the
University could raise an additional
$700,000, the $1,000,000 accruing to go
