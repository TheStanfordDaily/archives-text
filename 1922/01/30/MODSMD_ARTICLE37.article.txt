# GRANT W. CORBY SEES GREAT OPPORTUNITY IN ENDOWMENT DRIVE
## 
### 
"We at Stanford have one of the
greatest opportunitie sto really do some
thing big for the University that lias
ever been presented to the student body.
"We are sometime inclined to envy
those of the pioneer class, because of
the tremendous opportunities they had
to mould Stanford traditions, and to
formulate customs and ideals. We
know that they did their work well.
What this is today is due, in a measure,
to the individual efforts of those who
were privileged to be her at the start.
"But our opportunity has now ar
rived. We were born too late to be
pioneers in traditions, but we were born
just in time to be permitted to start off
the great drive for the endowment fnud.
This, is one of the biggest things Stan-

ford has undertaken. We must and
will put it over. Every member of the
University should feel it an honor to do
all in his power to make it a success.
"And the best way to start it on the
road to success is to give it a big start
here on the campus. If we, as a student
body, get behind the campaign and show
the world outside of this little peninsula
that we means business to such an ex
tent that we arc willing to give the First
material aid ourselves, then, and only
then, can we expect that those outside
of this community will follow our lead."

President. Senior Class.
