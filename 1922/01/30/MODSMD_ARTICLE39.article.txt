Dear Mr. Maloney:
As acting captain of our rugby foot
ball team which visited you last Thurs
day 1 am writing to thank Stanford
University through you, for the extra
ordinary kindness you showed us. We.
were all greatly pleased to see around
the University and enjoyed the visit
immensely.
I was sorry that, our stay in San
Francisco being so short, we were un
able to arrange for a return visit which
might possibly have interested some of
the team.
Thanking you very much for our visit

and hoping that next year we may mee.t
again and have a more equal game, I
am, Yours truly,
