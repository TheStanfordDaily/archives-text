# DEAN YOST ASSERTS CAMPAIGN WILL BRING FINE "BY-PRODUCTS"
## 
### 
Ihe campaign for endowment now
being launched for Stanford will bring
to her, besides the funds which she ur
gently needs, invaluable by-products. A
university lives not in its buildings, nec
essary as these are, but in the minds of
the public. In working for this fund all
friends will be made keenly conscious of
Stanford and will realize anew their re
lation to her. They will be laying up
for the future, therefore, not only mate
rial resources but also stores of loyalty
and of eagerness for service, which will
enrich both the University and the
giver. No greater gift, therefore, could
I ask for the women of Stanford, both
alumnae and students, than their pres
ent opportunity to work for their Alma
Mater. " MARY YOST,
