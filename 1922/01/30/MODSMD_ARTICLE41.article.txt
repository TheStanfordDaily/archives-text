# SUCCESS OF CAMPAIGN DEPENDS ON STUDENTS SAYS ALBERT TAYLOR
## 
### 
Stanford students are tiring the first
shot of the $3,000,000 campaign; they
are best acquainted with the needs of
the University; they 'best realize its
growth is possible only by securing ad
ditional funds; they best appreciate the
potential service that an expanding
Stanford can render. Unless that shot
is tired—the pledging of $200,000 —we
cannot with self-respect ask either the
alumni or the public to subscribe funds.
The pivot of the entire $3,000.0(10 cam
paign is the .student pledging: upon it
resolves the success or the failure of a
critical step in Stanford history.
