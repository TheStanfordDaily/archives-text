# STUDENTS KNOW DEBT TO STANFORDâ€”CLYDE
## 
### 
There never lias been a period in Stan
ford history when Stanford alumni and
students felt more keenly their respon
sibilities to their Alma Mater or were
so alive to the aims and needs of this
University as they are today.
On the success of this campaign rests
the future of Stanford. The mainte
nance of high academic standards, of a

worthy teaching staff, of a modern, fully
equipped plant with provision for fu
ture needs are all dependent on the. suc
cess of this campaign. Success will de
pend in turn on the co-operation of
Stanford students. It is a responsibility
we gladly shoulder.
