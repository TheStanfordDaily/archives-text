# "We Must Over-Subscribe Quota," Says Warren Lewis

"Stanford men and women must ac
cept the endowment campaign with all
seriousness for not in many years has
anything arisen of such moment to the
future welfare of the University. They
must be the leaders in the campaign,
and by over-subscribing the quota set
for them, indicates the way for the
alumnae to follow. Surely no student
or alumnus should miss this opportunity
to express his love for Stanford by
failing to contribute to the endowment
fund."
WARREN F. LEWIS.
