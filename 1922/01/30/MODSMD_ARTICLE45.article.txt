# Junior President Urges Action From Students
## 
### 
We must realize that unless we, as
students of Stanford, show the proper
spirit, we can not eocpect others to con
tribute to our cause. Proper spirit
means work and sacrifice, not mere
talking. The money is needed, and those
of us who can possibly give at all
should give as much as they can. Every
member of the junior class must be an
example to others, and demonstrate that
when Stanford needs help, '23 is ready
and prepared to assist.
/ HOWARD BROWN,
President, Junior Class.
