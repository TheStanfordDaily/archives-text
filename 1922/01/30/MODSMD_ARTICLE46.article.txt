# DEAN CULVER SHOWS WORKING STUDENTS' CAMPAIGN ATTITUDE
## 
### 
Not long ago a senior in Geology
who expects to graduate this summer
was in my office talking over things
in general. Largely by "hashing" and
summer work this man has put him
self through college. He will go in
with a big oil company upon gradua
tion. As is usual with men who are
about to finish their college work, my
friend has begun to realize what
Stanford has done for him.
As we talked I sketched informally
what my own career probably would
have been had Stanford not come into
my life. It is a familiar picture to
hundreds of Stanford men who have
come from small country places. The
senior's story just about matched
mine. Then he told me of his two
brothers and the great handicap they
were under because they were not
college men.
At the end of last quarter still an
other Geology man, just graduated,
came in and talked over the possibili
ties of his position with an oil com
pany. "The funny thing is," he added,
"I have just been offered another job
—two years in South America —These
are fair examples of what Stanford is
accomplishing for all her men in all
lines.
Take the Stanford men in your own
community, your county, state, and na
tion. They are leaders because they
have studied, worked and played with
the leaders at Stanford University.
They have caught the spirit of leader
ship. There is no way of really pay
ing for what one acquires at Stanford,
but the Endowment Drive affords an
opportunity to give tangible expression
to the realization of your debt to the
University.
Yesterday in conversation with a
junior, who has displayed much en
durance and skill in dancing, I took
occasion to congratulate him for being
out with the track squad and really
working to some purpose. "Well,"
said he, "I'm afraid I cannot accomp
lish very much, but I'd hate to think
of leaving Stanford without having ac
complished something for the Univer
sity."
There are many who feel the same
way when they go beyond the sound
of a jazz orchestra. The Endowment
Drive gives everyone his big chance
to qualify as a Stanford man.
Subscribe, not because others are
signing up or because of any hue and
cry. Think the matter over calmly
and try to measure out in your mind
just what Stanford means to you. It
cannot be done, but it is worth try
ing. Remember that there are five
years in which to pay i)p your sub
scription and that a great share of the
business of the world is carried on
through credit. "Pay as you go" is
a good general maxim, but if inter
preted literally, no one would go very
far.

Not long ago a senior in Geology
who expects to graduate this summer
was in my office talking over things
in general. Largely by "hashing" and
summer work this man has put him
self through college. He will go in
with a big oil company upon gradua
tion. As is usual with men who are
about to finish their college work, my
friend has begun to realize what
Stanford has done for him.
As we talked I sketched informally
what my own career probably would
have been had Stanford not come into
my life. It is a familiar picture to
hundreds of Stanford men who have
come from small country places. The
senior's story just about matched
mine. Then he told me of his two
brothers and the great handicap they
were under because they were not
college men.
At the end of last quarter still an
other Geology man, just graduated,
came in and talked over the possibili
ties of his position with an oil com
pany. "The funny thing is," he added,
"I have just been offered another job
—two years in South America —These
are fair examples of what Stanford is
accomplishing for all her men in all
lines.
Take the Stanford men in your own
community, your county, state, and na
tion. They are leaders because they
have studied, worked and played with
the leaders at Stanford University.
They have caught the spirit of leader
ship. There is no way of really pay
ing for what one acquires at Stanford,
but the Endowment Drive affords an
opportunity to give tangible expression
to the realization of your debt to the
University.
Yesterday in conversation with a
junior, who has displayed much en
durance and skill in dancing, I took
occasion to congratulate him for being
out with the track squad and really
working to some purpose. "Well,"
said he, "I'm afraid I cannot accomp
lish very much, but I'd hate to think
of leaving Stanford without having ac
complished something for the Univer
sity."
