# "EARNING CAPACITY SHOULD FORM BASIS FOR GIFTS," W.H. HALES
## 
### 
On tlie basis of earning capacity'
alone, Stanford students should reach
the $200,000 quota set. With $200,000
as a goal, the average contribution
should be $77. If some students who
are working their way through the Uni
versity, and can contribute one-half or
two-thirds of this amount, it is evident
that there are many who can give two
or three times the average donation.
Whether Stanford men and women are
willing to give to the school which is
offering them so many advantages re
mains to be seen.
W. H. HALES,
Student Manager.
