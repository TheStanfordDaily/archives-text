# "ALUMNI WILL FOLLOW STUDENTS"â€”MARSTON
## 
### 
Why campaign the students for the
endowment ?
Because the students' attitude here on
the campus has a great influence upon

the contributions and support that our
alumni will offer.
There have, been few occasions when
the students have had an opportunity to
conduct a University campaign, but
when such projects as the Stadium and
War Memorial came forth the alumni
before concentrating on these projects
asked, "What is the students' attitude
on the Farm?"
We have to endorse this project and
assure its success before we can chal
lenge the alumni. The only method of
procedure is to get behind this cam
paign when it is launched on Monday
and offer as liberal contributions as
possible.
