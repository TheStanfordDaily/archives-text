# KLECKNER ON HAND TO "KICK IN" SOME OF FIVE-YEAR PAY
## 
### 
If I should ever amount to a tinker's
folly-le-la in this, our vale of tears, 1
shall feel that 1 owe it most of all to
Stanford. If I never amount to a hoop
in Mayrtcld, 1 shall feel that I owe all
of it to myself. I do not consider my
self duty bound to put my thumb in the
endowment pie. And 1 can think of
many things more pleasurable. But
some way or other I shall feel myself
a nearer approach to a real man if I
kick in with a bit of my next live years'
wages to help an institution that lias
as its sole purpose the making of real
men and real women.
