# I CARD HANDBALL AND VOLLEY BALL TEAMS WILL MIX WITH U. C.
## 
### 
Cardinal handball squads and
volley hall sextet will mix things with
the. University of California's deputa
tion at Stanford, February 22, the day
of the Stanford-California basketball
game.
Although the handball men have not
been selected, Rutter, Sidway, Connol
ly, Cohen, Landweer, Berry, Carle, Cor
nish, Rumwell, and Atwill appear to be
the men from whom the Stanford squad
is most likely to be picked. The sport
is at present handicapped by the loss of
several of the fastest men to other ac
tivities, leaving Rutter and Cohen as
the only men with varsity experience.
However, the Cardinal court team will
be materially strengthened by the addi
tion of Connolly and Runnvell. In the
workouts of the last few nights, the
two have shown considerable ability in
shoving the miniature sphere around
Sidway and Landweer make a fast dou
ble combination and will prove to be an
enigma to any U. C. pair. Their team
work and improvement in directing shots
is quite noticeable in the handball tour
naments.
Aspirants for the volley ball team are
working out on the gymnasium volley
ball courts, Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday afternoons at 4:20. The prob
able line-up for the U. C. game will be:
Hasselmeyer, Ingram, Parks, Temple
ton, Prices, and Geyer.
