# A. R. TYLER BELIEVES ANY GIFT WILL HELP
## 
### 
The success or failure of the drive for
$200,(XX) on the Stanford campus will
determine, the success or failure of the
entire campaign. How any student or
persons, claiming friendship and loy
alty to Stanford can ignore this call
for funds is beyond my comprehension.
Emotions cannot be expressed in dol
lars and cents, and no matter how small
the gift, the donor shows that he is be
hind the drive and behind the Univer
sity. Stanford needs help; let's help.
A. R. TYLER,
President, Sequoia Club.
