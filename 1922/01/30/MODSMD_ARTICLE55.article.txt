# WEIGHT TEAM WINS CLOSE BASKET GAME
## Game Shows Lightweights Good at Guarding; Scoring Is Poor 
### 
After lighting up and down the court
an hour and a half, including time out
for consultatition and fouling, Stan
ford's lightweight quintet dropped in a
basket during the extra rive-minute pe
riod. winning from the Lowell 130-
pounders, 20-18.
The game carried only fairly evenly.
Stanford was never behind at any time.
The half closed with the score reading
13-12 in the Cards' favor. Neither side
scored much in the second half but
merely crashed around until the score
was tied at eighten all when Big Bertha
was fired.
The extra period seemed to be going
quite as aimlessly as the others, each
side getting a chance to stand at either
side of their goal and toss the ball over
it. When close shooting had failed to
bring the desired results, Kitou dribbled
the ball out to the middle of the floor
and with apparent ease made a perfect
shot. This was the last and winning
basktt of the game.
Coach Young went after this game
with a new combination. Blosser was
introduced as running guard and Young
moved up to forward position. This
appears to be the best combination yet
for the new guard put in a couple of
pretty, long shots during the first part
of the game.
Scoring remains the weakness of the
lights. Hogle was high man last Sat
urday night with a total of six. The
first two forwards didn't make a field
goal although the passing and guarding
game of the team was good. Even
the free throws went bad. Only six out
of a possible sixteen were converted
while Ainsworth, Lowell forward, made
four out of five good.
Tomorrow night is the tentative date
for the Olympic Club contest. Perhaps
Koba can b epersuaded to play by then,
since the varsity will not be practicing
here. If he still insists in working out
with the scrubs there will be a hard
row for the 130-pounders next Tuesday
night.
The lineup follows: Stanford—Young,
Meyer, forwards; Hogle, center; Blos
ser, Silviera, guards. Lowell—Ncimon,
Cook, guards; Scale, ctnter; Costagnet
to, Ainsworth, forwards. Substitutes:
Stanford —Hobro, Kitou, Hollingsworth,
Sanford. Lowell—Hanley, Winson. Ref

lights. Hogle was high man last Sat
urday night with a total of six. The
first two forwards didn't make a field
goal although the passing and guarding
game of the team was good. Even
the free throws went bad. Only six out
of a possible sixteen were converted
while Ainsworth, Lowell forward, made
four out of five good.
Tomorrow night is the tentative date
for the Olympic Club contest. Perhaps
Koba can b epersuaded to play by then,
since the varsity will not be practicing
here. If he still insists in working out
with the scrubs there will be a hard
row for the 130-pounders next Tuesday
night.
The lineup follows: Stanford—Young,
Meyer, forwards; Hogle, center; Blos
ser, Silviera, guards. Lowell—Ncimon,
Cook, guards; Scale, ctnter; Costagnet
to, Ainsworth, forwards. Substitutes:
Stanford —Hobro, Kitou, Hollingsworth,
Sanford. Lowell—Hanley, Winson. Ref
