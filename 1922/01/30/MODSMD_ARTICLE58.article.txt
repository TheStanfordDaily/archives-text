# JACKSON REYNOLDS IS MADE PRESIDENT OF NEW YORK BANK
## 
### 
Jackson E. Reynolds, '9(5, has been
made president of the First National j
Bank of New York City, one of the
largest and most influential institu
tions in the country. The New York
newspapers in commenting on Rey
nolds' promotion declare that the rise
of Reynolds to this position of pre
eminent finanoial responsibility within
a brief period of live years is one of
the most spectacular events that ever
took place in the Wall Street district.
Reynolds has had a very varied
career of which his connection with
banking has occupied only the last five
years. As an undergraduate he was
one of the best half backs that ever
played on a Stanford team. Gradu
ating from Stanford in '96, he took
graduate work in law at Columbia Uni
versity, receiving his degree from the
Law School there in 1599. For ten
years, beginning in 1903, he was pro
fessor of law at Columbia and left that
position to become general council for
the Central Railroad of New Jersey.
In this capacity he won a great repu
tation and especially attracted atten
tion by his argument of the Reading
anti-trust case which he tried in the
lower courts and argued before the
United States Supreme Court.
It was at this time that he attracted
the attention of George F. Baker of
the First National Bank, who, in 1917,
persuaded Reynolds to accept a posi
tion as vice-president with the First
National. In that capacity Reynolds
has exercised increasingly important
functions in the affairs of the bank of
the financial districts of New York.
