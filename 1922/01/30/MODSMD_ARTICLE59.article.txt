##

"Fire Inspector Lamb's suggestion uf
a gent; ' campus clean up drive comes
just at the right time," Comptroller
Roth says. "With Stanford starting in
on a campaign for outside gifts, there
could he no better impression given to
the donors than that we would t;tk cure
of what we get.
"It has been- the policy of the I'ni
versitv to encourage a feeling of pride,
in the student body, for the appearance
of the farm. It is almost impossible to
keep the grounds up if the students do
not feel a responsibility and desire to
keep them clean. They have been ver\
successful.
"In Kastc.rn universities there are con
centrated efforts made every year to keep
the students interested. Miami L'niver
sity was placarded with reminders such
as, 'This Is Your Campus.' Other col
leges have similar methods of accom
plishing litis."
Comptroller Roth pointed out that
often gifts to a university are not in
the form of money, but instead may he
a utility. Often dormitories are given,
and it makes chances for such donations
brighter when there is an assurance that
the building will not be battered about.
There will be a chance for a saving
in insurance premiums, he said, for
when the buildings are kept up and are
free from rubbish the risk is a great
deal less. This care would make for
better health also.
A definite campaign will shortly he
announced for the near future.
