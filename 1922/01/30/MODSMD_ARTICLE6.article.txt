# PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT

### 
Stanford University is making a new decision which will determine
its future for all time. The University has reached the limit made
possible by the Stanford fortune. If it is to go forward and upward
it can only do so through the support of every member of the Stanford
family and of the public in general. Stanford now takes its place
among the great national universities of this country.
Its future does not rest with the tax-payers of any given state but
with its friends. Through the sale of the ranches, the improvement
in the earning power of the endowment funds, and the tuition fees, we
have been able to go through the troublesome war period with all of
its intricate problems without losing our stride. We have faced the
problems of a fifty cent dollar, of the need of increasing the salaries,
of increased taxation, and general expenses, the development of a
pension fund, with our ten-year program, we can see our way to steady
progress, provided we can obtain certain additions to our salary roll
and certain new buildings.
During the past year the President's budget has included $130,000
in actual gifts for current expenses. This is the first great evidence of
our new position, of our new opportunity, and of the support that is
coming to us... The future of Stanford is in the hands of the students
of today and of the alumni of the days that have gone before.
Independent, self-contained, apparently rich, the University has
gone its way to the best of its ability, making limitations in various
ways, including the number of students accepted, so that the work
done could be kept on a satisfactory plane. We need to change the
general sentiment even of our alumni in regard to our pressing need.
Not to Grow is in part to die. The University must have increased
facilities, more buildings, more advantages, must keep step with the
progress made in education, just as a growing boy must have new
clothes, and new facilities as his capacity to do more increases with
age.
We have at present two undeveloped sources of financial strength,
one is the Palo Alto Farm and the other assistance from the members
of the great Stanford family and the public. There are no other
possible sources of increased income that are of any particular conse
quence. As much as the burden as is reasonable has been shifted to
the shoulders of those receiving the benefit through the tuition fee.
Our needs are many if we are to become the institution that every
Stanford man and every Stanford woman hopes for.
It is a rare opportunity that faces the student of today. He can
have a definite part in molding the future of the institution. The Stan
ford family shifted thq burden of the conduct of the University onto
the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees have gone through a
period in the management of the trust bringing in more and more
alumni members to serve. Now the Board in turn, because of the
expanding needs and great opportunities, finds it necessary to shift
the burden to all members of the Stanford family and to the public.
There is every reason to anticipate that we can obtain the same
help that has come to similar institutions elsewhere. Stanford is the
one great private endowed university west of St. Louis. Certainly
from this vast territory there will come the interest and the help that
is needed.
Through this endowment campaign the University will obtain
widespread publicity, gain new friends and bring to the attention of
all the real situation. We have nothing to conceal. We have made
our financial records public. We think that thera is public apprecia
tion of our service and of our need. Every student can become a
center of information and can advance the interest of the University
in a hundred ways.
Disagreeing, as we always will, on various minor parts, if we can
agree that we will all work together for Stanford and Stanford's pro
gress, we can rest assured that within another generation no institu
tion in the country will have better facilities, a better reputation, or
achieve better results in education.
