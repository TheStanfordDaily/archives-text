# YEARLING QUINTET SHOWS GOOD FORM
## Defeats Lowell Team 40-5; Mentor Last Second Team Last Half 
### 
Playing in t lit best form tlie.y have
shown this season, Duffy Seay's fresh
men overwhelmed Lowell High School,
40-5.
The high school live was made up of
smaller men and was not particularly
speedy, offering hut little resistance, to
the fast formations of the babes. Most
of the play hovered under the Stanford
goal and when the visitors did snag the
ball out they had a hard time getting
more than one long shot at their own
basket.
Hooper and Alexander tied for high
score honors, each getting twelve. All
of Hooper's points were from baskets
and eight of Alexander's were converted
free throws, however. Out of twelve
tries, Alexander only missed four.
The class Steele showed at center is
going to he hard for Middleton to beat
in order to get his old job back. Livery
play that the lighting center could get
to in time he was into. He is an effi
cient guarder, all over the Moor, and he
scored well besides feeding the for
wards.
Patterson did the best work for the
city team, scoring twice, although lie
was responsible for three of the fouls.
The line up was as follows: Stanford
—1 looper, Alexander, forwards; Steele,
center; Sliipke, running guard; Oliva,
standing guard, Lowell—Patterson,
Frazer, forwards; Bernard, center;
Smith, running guard; Rankin, stand
ing guard. Substitutions: Stanford—

ander; Middleton for'Steele; Wisely for

for Bernard; Levy for Rankin. Referee:
