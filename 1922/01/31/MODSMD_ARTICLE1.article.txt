# BASKETBALL FIVE IN PRACTICE FOR CALIFORNIA BOUT
## Van Gent's Men Back Monday From Northern Tour; Start Work-outs For Bruin Game 
### 
Unheralded the ten members of the
varsity basketball squad, accompanied
by Manager Ernest A. Wilson, return
ed to the native hearth yesterday
morning after a week's barnstorming
in Oregon.
Coach Gene Van Gent stopped off at
Sacramento yesterday and arrived on
the campus this afternoon.
Confronted by the first game of the
California series next Saturday night,
the Cardinal basket shooters lost no
time in getting to work this afternoon
under the direction of Van Gent. Al
though it is not readily noticeable, the
Oregon trip and the heavy schedule of
games has been somewhat of a strain
on the players.
As a consequence, it is probable that
light workouts will replace the un
usual strenuous practices for the first
of the week. It will be two days before
the men get rid of the stiffness of the
train ride and are able to go at top
speed again.
Weight and height is the thing that
Van Gent is after to strengthen the
Cardinal quintet. If "Lefty" Rogers'
knee rounds into shape in time, it is
more than likely he will be played in
the game with California next Satur
day.
The weakness of the Cardinal five
was sharply brought out in the seri
es with the Oregon Aggies. Every man

on the Aggie team towered above the
Stanford players, and Van Gent's
charges were faced with an almost im
possible handicap to overcome.

The team's return from the North
brought to light several facts encou
raging to Cardinal basketball follow
ers. Bob Janssen, who was disquali
fied in the first fifteen minutes of the
O. A. C. game Friday night, went
through the entire contest the follow
ing night. Janssen's wind has been
troubling him all season, and this was
his first, whole game. Howell, who
replaced him in the first contest, was
off-color, and Van Gent played both
DeGroot and Campbell at center, but
