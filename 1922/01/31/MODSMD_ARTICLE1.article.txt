# BASKETBALL FIVE IN PRACTICE FOR CALIFORNIA BOUT
## Van Gent's Men Back Monday From Northern Tour; Start Work-outs For Bruin Game 
### 
Unheralded the ten members of the
varsity basketball squad, accompanied
by Manager Ernest A. Wilson, return
ed to the native hearth yesterday
morning after a week's barnstorming
in Oregon.
Coach Gene Van Gent stopped off at
Sacramento yesterday and arrived on
the campus this afternoon.
Confronted by the first game of the
California series next Saturday night,
the Cardinal basket shooters lost no
time in getting to work this afternoon
under the direction of Van Gent. Al
though it is not readily noticeable, the
Oregon trip and the heavy schedule of
games has been somewhat of a strain
on the players.
As a consequence, it is probable that
light workouts will replace the un
usual strenuous practices for the first
of the week. It will be two days before
the men get rid of the stiffness of the
train ride and are able to go at top
speed again.
Weight and height is the thing that
Van Gent is after to strengthen the
Cardinal quintet. If "Lefty" Rogers'
knee rounds into shape in time, it is
more than likely he will be played in
the game with California next Satur
day.
The weakness of the Cardinal five
was sharply brought out in the seri
es with the Oregon Aggies. Every man

on the Aggie team towered above the
Stanford players, and Van Gent's
charges were faced with an almost im
possible handicap to overcome.

The team's return from the North
brought to light several facts encou
raging to Cardinal basketball follow
ers. Bob Janssen, who was disquali
fied in the first fifteen minutes of the
O. A. C. game Friday night, went
through the entire contest the follow
ing night. Janssen's wind has been
troubling him all season, and this was
his first, whole game. Howell, who
replaced him in the first contest, was
off-color, and Van Gent played both
DeGroot and Campbell at center, but
neither of them filled Janssen's shoes.
Van Gent tried a new combination
in the second Aggie game, starting
Pitts in place of McHose. The latter
went in at guard for Richmond, while
Pitts, who is heavier than the fast
forward, played most of the game.
The teams in the games at Corvallis
went in at hammer-and-tongs, with no
quarter given and none asked. The
most encouraging feature of the second
game was the manner in which the
Cardinal defense smothered Hjelte's
efforts.
The Oregon games were bitterly
contested, and there was less action.
According to reports brought back by
gation is just now winding into top
gation is just no wrounidng into top
shape, and they are stronger than is
generally credited.
The youthful appearance of McHose,
together with his size and accurate!
basket-shooting, caused quite a bit of
comment at Eugene. The speed and
short passing of Davies, McHose and
Janssen gave the Cardinal five a big
advantage over George Bohler's lads.
On tho return trip the members of
the Stanford squad turned their ac
tivities from basketball to snow-ball
ing in the Siskiyou mountains.

es with the Oregon Aggies. Every man

on the Aggie team towered above the
Stanford players, and Van Gent's
charges were faced with an almost im
possible handicap to overcome.

The team's return from the North
brought to light several facts encou
raging to Cardinal basketball follow
ers. Bob Janssen, who was disquali
fied in the first fifteen minutes of the
O. A. C. game Friday night, went
through the entire contest the follow
ing night. Janssen's wind has been
troubling him all season, and this was
his first, whole game. Howell, who
replaced him in the first contest, was
off-color, and Van Gent played both
DeGroot and Campbell at center, but
neither of them filled Janssen's shoes.
Van Gent tried a new combination
in the second Aggie game, starting
Pitts in place of McHose. The latter
went in at guard for Richmond, while
Pitts, who is heavier than the fast
forward, played most of the game.
The teams in the games at Corvallis
went in at hammer-and-tongs, with no
quarter given and none asked. The
most encouraging feature of the second
game was the manner in which the
Cardinal defense smothered Hjelte's
efforts.
The Oregon games were bitterly
contested, and there was less action.
According to reports brought back by
gation is just now winding into top
gation is just no wrounidng into top
shape, and they are stronger than is
generally credited.
The youthful appearance of McHose,
together with his size and accurate!
basket-shooting, caused quite a bit of
comment at Eugene. The speed and
short passing of Davies, McHose and
Janssen gave the Cardinal five a big
advantage over George Bohler's lads.
On tho return trip the members of
the Stanford squad turned their ac
tivities from basketball to snow-ball
ing in the Siskiyou mountains.
Unheralded the ten members of the
varsity basketball squad, accompanied
by Manager Ernest A. Wilson, return
ed to the native hearth yesterday
morning after a week's barnstorming
in Oregon.
Coach Gene Van Gent stopped off at
Sacramento yesterday and arrived on
the campus this afternoon.
Confronted by the first game of the
California series next Saturday night,
the Cardinal basket shooters lost no
time in getting to work this afternoon
under the direction of Van Gent. Al
though it is not readily noticeable, the
Oregon trip and the heavy schedule of
games has been somewhat of a strain
on the players.
As a consequence, it is probable that
light workouts will replace the un
usual strenuous practices for the first
of the week. It will be two days before
the men get rid of the stiffness of the
train ride and are able to go at top
speed again.
Weight and height is the thing that
Van Gent is after to strengthen the
Cardinal quintet. If "Lefty" Rogers'
knee rounds into shape in time, it is
more than likely he will be played in
the game with California next Satur
day.
The weakness of the Cardinal five
was sharply brought out in the seri
