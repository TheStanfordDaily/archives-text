The University of Washington quintet
dealt the death blow to California's fast
fading hopes for the Conference cham
pionship last week-end by defeating the
Bears twice.

It is practically a 19 to 1 shot that the
Sundodgers will be returned winners
when the season ends. The only way
in which any rival team would come
within striking distance of the strong
Seattle aggregation would be for Idaho
and Washington State to defeat the
leaders in the coming series.
The southern teams, for the first time
;in two years, are forced to trail the
northern fives in the race for the flag.
At the present time, Washington is un
doubtedly the strongest court machine
| 011 the Coast, with Washington State and
J California second and third, respectively.
Stanford's prospects in the Conference
appear none too bright, although the
: Cardinals should finish well up among
| the leaders. Oregon ought to offer little
I resistance for Van Gent's charges on
! their home court. It will he a different
j story, however, when the strong Wash
ington State quintet comes south. If
; Stanford can dispose of Fred Holder's
i men, it has an even break to finish third.

The pacemaking Sundodgers will not
give California basketball fans a chance
to look them over, as they will not play
| either Stanford or California this veat*.
