# BABE TEAMS PRACTICE WITH LIGHTWEIGHTS
## 
### 
Scrimmage with the 130-pound basket
ball team occupied most of the time of
the Freshman squad last night.
During the evening Coach Seay tried
several new combinations of his players,
but none of them seems to be as effec
tive as the one that has started the last
three games, . namely, Alexander and
Hooper, forwards, Steele, center, and
Shipke and Oliva, guards.
Middle-ton seems to have recovered to
some extent from the slum]) into which
he fell in the Commerce High School
game. His goal shooting has materially
improved, but he lacks to some extent the
speed and aggressiveness of Steele.
Hoffman will probably be back on the
floor the latter part of the week. His
return will fill a department of the
game that has long gone unattendedâ€”
converting of foul shots. Neither of the
present forwards lias been able to score
more than half the tries in a game.
During the latter part of the practice
period Coach Seay drilled his charges
in basket shooting from every angle of
the floor.
Mountain View High School will play
the Freshmen on the local court Wed
nesday evening. There will be no varsity
game.
