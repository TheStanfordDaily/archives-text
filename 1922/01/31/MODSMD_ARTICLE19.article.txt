# PHI DELTA THETA AND EL CAPITAN WIN COURT GAMES
## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta's basketball men de
feated Delta Chi, 18 to 8, and El Capitan
took the large end of an 11-2 score
from Sequoia 1 and 3. Phi Kappa Psi
won by forfeit, but played a practice
game with a pick-up team.

The Phi Delta Theta five worked to
gether, and by short passing repeatedly
carried the ball down the court for a
shot at the basket. Pigott was the stellar
light for the winners. His accurate
shooting netted five baskets. Fletcher,
center, was a good teammate for Pigott,
and made six points. O'Hara played a
fast game as running guard, persistently
upsetting the calculations of the Delta
Chi forwards. Merrill substituted for
O'Hara.
The first half ended with Phi Delta
Theta leading 14 to 8. No scoring was
done by Delta Chi in the second half,
due mainly to the close guarding of
O'Hara and Kraft. The latter is a stone
wall defense at standing guard.
Coplcn, Conard, and Tritle made up
the most formidable combination for
Delta Chi. Conard usually gets the
touch at center, while Coplen plays a
fast forward game. If they had been
able to get loose from their opponents'
strict guarding, the score would have
been much different. Tritle, at running
guard, showed his customary battle and
was a good bet at recovering the ball.
The contest between El Capitan and
Sequoia was a comparatively quiet af
fair. White and Fehren looped a pair
Jof baskets each for El Capitan. Cooper
1 made his team's lone'basket.
A consolation tournament will be run
j off for those teams finishing second in
| the five leagues. This has been planned
! because of the fact that many very good
i quintets are unable to maintain the
championship percentage. The winner of
i the consolation tournament may chal
lenge winners of the intramural leagues.
