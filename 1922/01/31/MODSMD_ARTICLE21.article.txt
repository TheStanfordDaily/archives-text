"Breathes there a man, with soul so dead
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land?
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burned
As home his footsteps he hath turned
; â€¢ From wandering on foreign strand?"
Many of us learned these lines by Walter Scott in
the grades, and then they meant nothing more to us
than poety to be memorized. But as we became older
they began to have real meaning for us. They de
scribed so adequately what we often wanted to put
into words. Although not many of lis have ever
left our native land and felt the joy of returning, we
have learned to feel the same emotion in regard to
the place of our birth or a place where we have lived
very happily.
It is much the same with college students. \Ve
are glad to finish each college year, but there is al
ways more joy attached to our return following a
vacation period. That is the feeling that will prompt
Stanford men and women to give to the University
during the endowment cair.paign. Stanford needs
money now more than at any time during' its history.
Because we understand that need better, possibly,
than any of the members of the Stanford family who
have gone before us, we have asked to be the first to
give. Our quota in the first million has been set at
$200,000.

When this amount has been subscribed here <yi the
campus and the word goes out to the rest of the
Stanford family in the world that we have attested
our loyalty by exceeding the quota set they will ex
press their love for Stanford by subscribing to the
endowment, although they are unable to turn their
footsteps homeward.
