A fellow-student today takes issue with the Daily
and makes "feeble protest at the recent tone our
editorials have taken on the question of freshman
discipline." This communication marks the first re
action to these editorials, and we would he pleased
to hear now from a student who spent a part or all
of his freshman tear in Stanford.
Our correspondent refers to the customary duties
and labors which have been the freshman's privilege
since colleges were first founded. In that he touches
the crux of the whole matter. Under the present
system of discipline "customary duties and labors"
have become duties and tasks for the freshmen rather
than privileges. The whole idea of freshman priv
ileges has been overturned for one of duty. The
problem now is to bring these labors back to the priv
ilege basis—to the place where the freshman will
realize that he is doing the things asked of him be
cause they are the things he should do as a new mem
br of the Stanford family, and not because he fears
the tub and the paddle in the hands of the sopho
mores.
It is pleasing to note that "recent reforms on the
hazing question have relieved it almost wholly of its
blood-thirsty aspect." Now, if reforms were made
on hazing itself and we got back to the place where
freshmen regarded their tasks as privileges and we
"disciplined" them for the pure fun of it rather than
for the purpose of bringing about a change in their
mental make-ups we would know that the pledges of
the men contained in the 1918 report of the President
meant something. Very little is gained if the aspect
is changed while the practices continue unchanged.
We now make freshman discipline a business in
stead of a pleasure. No freshman minds the days
when he has to duck around a corner to avoid a
bunch of sophomores whom lie thinks are going to
job him. The sophomores who josh the freshman

when they encounter him for the pure fun of it lose
nothing of time and are not kept out of worth-while
activities. Neither are the freshmen distracted. But
when the sophomores, often at the behest of the
upperclassmen, organize for the deliberate purpose
of hazing, they not only waste their own time, but
they distract the freshman from the things he came
here to do.
Surely there is some "glamour" connected with
athletic victories over our rivals. There is glamour
connected with a play well staged. If there is no
great glamour there is plenty of personal elation in
doing good work in the classrooms and receiving
good grades.
Since Stanford began on an Utopian basis, is it
too much to attempt to reorganize that Utopia. The
classes of '95 and '96 did not make a business of
freshman discipline. Rather, they worked together
for the greatest good of the University, even though
they had their fun with the freshmen just the same.

upperclassmen, organize for the deliberate purpose
of hazing, they not only waste their own time, but
they distract the freshman from the things he came
here to do.
Surely there is some "glamour" connected with
athletic victories over our rivals. There is glamour
connected with a play well staged. If there is no
great glamour there is plenty of personal elation in
doing good work in the classrooms and receiving
good grades.
Since Stanford began on an Utopian basis, is it
too much to attempt to reorganize that Utopia. The
classes of '95 and '96 did not make a business of
freshman discipline. Rather, they worked together
for the greatest good of the University, even though
they had their fun with the freshmen just the same.
A fellow-student today takes issue with the Daily
and makes "feeble protest at the recent tone our
editorials have taken on the question of freshman
discipline." This communication marks the first re
action to these editorials, and we would he pleased
to hear now from a student who spent a part or all
of his freshman tear in Stanford.
Our correspondent refers to the customary duties
and labors which have been the freshman's privilege
since colleges were first founded. In that he touches
the crux of the whole matter. Under the present
system of discipline "customary duties and labors"
have become duties and tasks for the freshmen rather
than privileges. The whole idea of freshman priv
ileges has been overturned for one of duty. The
problem now is to bring these labors back to the priv
ilege basis—to the place where the freshman will
realize that he is doing the things asked of him be
cause they are the things he should do as a new mem
br of the Stanford family, and not because he fears
the tub and the paddle in the hands of the sopho
mores.
It is pleasing to note that "recent reforms on the
hazing question have relieved it almost wholly of its
blood-thirsty aspect." Now, if reforms were made
on hazing itself and we got back to the place where
freshmen regarded their tasks as privileges and we
"disciplined" them for the pure fun of it rather than
for the purpose of bringing about a change in their
mental make-ups we would know that the pledges of
the men contained in the 1918 report of the President
meant something. Very little is gained if the aspect
is changed while the practices continue unchanged.
We now make freshman discipline a business in
stead of a pleasure. No freshman minds the days
when he has to duck around a corner to avoid a
bunch of sophomores whom lie thinks are going to
job him. The sophomores who josh the freshman

when they encounter him for the pure fun of it lose
nothing of time and are not kept out of worth-while
activities. Neither are the freshmen distracted. But
when the sophomores, often at the behest of the
upperclassmen, organize for the deliberate purpose
of hazing, they not only waste their own time, but
they distract the freshman from the things he came
here to do.
