It is after great tribulation that Cabbages has com
pleted a very remarkable collection. It has always been
the policy of the company to go into everything with
the idea of doing it up in the best possible manner.
Our patrons will find nothing slip-shod about the
method in which we dispatch business. Therefore we
feel that our offering to the lovers (nature, art, truth,
etc.) of the campus can not help being received with
the greatest of satisfaction.
A tremble of pride quakes our typewriter as it an
nounces to the world the most complete collection of
prominent figures in the banking circles of this or any
other country. The exhibit follows:
123456789 0.

That's sure to be appreciated by the freshman who
heard somebody ask if the car said "University" or
"Waverley," and has been listening to them ever since.

Next we will have a little verse, entitled:
FOR SNAKES
"Let's talk of the bard who sadly sings,
As he picks with his molars the high G strings,
Oi the tropic bird which flaps its wings
A-helping its mate dry its underthings;
Or even of lizards with pearl earrings;
Blank verse; free love; Freud's reasoning
But lady, lady, cease gabbling
That, 'Oh! What a wonderful night.' .
"Converse, if you must, like a tropic gale.
Of the dress making course you took by mail.
On helping a sailor trim a sail;
Or of Jack and Jill, who took their pail
On a dairy route up hill, down dale,
Till they tripped, which, of course, made the com
pany fail
But hold, or prepare to pay my bail,
That, 'Oh! What a wonderful night.'
"Let me know what you'd do for an aching corn;
Your reaction on reading 'Eric Dorn'.
Tell me the way to look so forlorn
And why women rage at a mere man's scorn.
Ask me to tell you when I was born,
Why cars run nights and not early morn.
But stop, 'ere my reason to shreds is torn.
That, 'Oh! what a wonderful night.'"
—-B. Lee Ache.

Well children, isn't it about time for the usual bed
time story. We haven't had time for one for some time,
probably because we were so busy making the first mil
lion for Stanford that we got out the habit of going to
bed. Here's one:

STUMPED
Corn-Plaster Bluejay and Red Woodpecker had perch
ed in a small bush near the little hollow stump and
were passing the time of the day when "Brow'' Beetle
had reached the landing between the fourth floor and
the fifth, where his room was.
Catching sight of the climbing Cleopatra, Corn
plaster cried, "Hey, Red, give a look. There's the
first course for our dinner!" Brow heard his foe and
scurried into his room, slamming the door behind him
self just in time to hear a sharp rap from Red's beak
followed by a disappointed, "No, it's knot."
A sigh filtered through his bearded pincers. It was
becoming more and more monotonous to save one's life
when anyone would oblige a person if he wished to be
rid of it. He threw another scuttle-ful of coal on the
fire and settled down to sharpening his teeth on a Union
muffin before tackling his meal of parched corn.
Just as he finished his meal the sun fell into the
frozen lake, for it was a choice frontage our friends
had. He hoped that it would be pieced before morning
for coal was expensive. As darkness stole over the
land, Brow settled down to the latest "Wildcat" story
till it should become time to work.
At this moment there came a thundrous beating on
the door. Throwing it open he saw two fire-flies, well
lit, supporting his room-mate. With a shout they dashed
in and dropping their burden on the couch, struck up a
rollicking ditty as only lit flre-flies know how.
The entire edifice was in an uproar. The worms
were crawling out to their c'ates, in the hall several
grubs were playing cricket and making poor pretension,
the tenor katydid on the floor below started tuning up.
Tossing his visitors out he put his room-mate to bed.
The racket increased.
Brow Beetle was not to be trifled with. Thrusting his
head out of the window he asserted himself. "Key
down! How in hell can I study?"
One shout was enough. Closing the window he
straightened up and amoothed back his toupee. All
was well. He went to bed,
—Kernel Filbert House.
