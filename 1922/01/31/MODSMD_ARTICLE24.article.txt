To the Editor: —Permit me to utter !
a few lines of feeble protest at the
recent tone your editorials have taken
on the questidn Of Freshman discip
line. If I interpret your views cor
rectly—and I can see no other inter
pretation —it is your belief that F. D.
as an institution should be uprooted
bodily and hurled over the Stanford
horizon into oblivion; and in the term
"discipline" you include not only the
mildest form of modern hazing but
also the customary duties and labors
which have been the Freshman's pri
vilege since colleges were first founded.
This movement of yours is carrying
a good thing entirely too far, Mr.
Editor. The recent reforms on the
hazing question have relieved it al
most wholly of its blood-thirsty aspect.
There is no longer any danger of
killing or maiming or wounding and in
fact, discipline as such is only admin
istered today in cases where it is
urgently needed. That there are such
cases no one can deny.
The average Freshman when he
first enters college is already fed up
with a sense of his own importance.
Place him face to face with the pro
paganda of fraternity rushing and
other such factors which unavoidably
and to the name of his self-conceit, and
you will soon have the ideal snob —
unless some measures are taken to
counteract it. Surely it is sheer folly
for you to suggest in fact that the
entire student body lay itself prostrate
at his feet. What he needs is some
guiding hand —not tongue—to direct
and divert his energies. The father
in the great American home sees the
necessity of educating his child at
both ends. Should we be any the less
hesitant in so educating the youngest
of our college family here?
We have gone far enough in this so
called hazing reform, Mr. Editor. To
go any further would rob college life
of much of its glamor and would
generate a clan of unspeakable college
j snobs. Why not let well-enough alone
instead of attempting to organize an
other Utopia? G. M. P., '22.
|To the Editor: —It isn't often that an
editor is fortunate enough to receive
an evaluating criticism of the influ
ence his articles have on the readers.
Your editorial on "A Question of
Years", Friday, January 27th, is an
article that calls for an expression of
congratulations and an evaluation of
the highest order.
During the eight years that f have
I been connected with the UmveisPy
| and il:r Student Body, many attempts
i'.ive been made to "change conditions"
im the matter of frosh dis. ,1- pline and
: underclassman relationships—but they
were only attempts at reform. Your
| article goes to the bottom of the
1 whole problem and indicates the un
! desirability of present and past prac
j tice. Your statement of solution is
j proper and a logical outgrowth of a
tendency to replace undesirable con
ditions with a new policy, sound in
every respect, practicable in its ap
plication, and unrestricted in scope for
progress.
Too much emphasis can not be
given this proposition and it is hoped
that immediate plans will be laid to
I bring about the desired change.
The other efforts which are being
j made by the Daily to elevate the atti
: tude of its readers to the lofty ideals
of traditional Stanford Spirit are not
! to be overlooked in that word of ap-
I proval. G. I. L„ '18.
To the Editor: —What's this you're
advocating in your sheet? Do you
mean to say that you would grab fresh
man discipline by the neck and throw
|it out the back door. If that's what
I you mean, then Lord have pity on us!
| Things has come to a pretty pass
when an upperclassman can't walk
' across the Quad without getting
knocked down by a big bruiser of a
I frosh. Why, I'm getting so's I shiver
like September Forenoon when I go
' to bed for fear some freshman will
come up to the room and give me a
tubbing. Please. Mr. Editor, cut it
out! Can't you see you're leading the
University on to certain destruction?
Now I can remember when I was a
frosh and had to work sixteen hours
a day decorating for dances and swab
bing off the windows and then get
tubbed three times that night for look
ing wishful at a cigarette butt. No
body won't get hurt the way things is
run now and the frosh will tend to
their own business, which is the only
class left that does that anymore. In
stead of having our famous democracy,
we will live under a rule of tyranny
imposed by these new guys. Us up
perclassmen has got to stay organized
or we'll get ours and then some.
Anyway, we got no right to rob the
frosh of his good times. Gosh, I wish
I was a frosh again so's I could get
more baths and hang around a dark
room fixing up for just one more good
pants warming. Let's all pull together
to keep down the freshman menace
and uphold Stanford democracy, which
owes its existence to Freshman
Discipline.
Yours till discipline dies,
ARCH TUBBER.
