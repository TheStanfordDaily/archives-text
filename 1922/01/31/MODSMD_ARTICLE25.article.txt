The Outstanding Question.
It is becoming clearer every day that
for the American people the final test
of the Washington .Conference i> to be
found in the proposed Four Power Pact
for the Pacific. Perhaps one might bet
ter add that it is to be a test of the
political sense of the American people.

The Hughes program for naval limi
tation does not in its modified form con
stitute a test. There is too general

agreement upon its soundness in wisdom
and expediency. Nor is there any con
siderable division of opinion upon the
Root proposals for China, which have
been so elaborate. The bulk of the
American people seem in a mood to tind
in the purpose, presentation and pro
gram of Hughes and Root the natural
culmination of the insistent application
of an American point of view to inter
national affairs.

But it is quite otherwise in the case
of the Four Power Pact. This proposed
alliance of the four most powerful mili
tary nations came as a surprise to the
Conference itself, when it was presented
at the session of December 10th. Such
a development was not foreshadowed in
the agenda, and no word of its prepara

tion had come out of the committee
rooms.
Fur weeks following thi> startling
proposal there was much expression of
surprise, in some quarters uncertainty,
but very little avowed opposition. But
it did not seem possible that genuine
supporters of the League of Nations
could support this proposed pact. An
alliance of four nations to apply to a
restricted area of the earth's surface
suggested a road quite unlike that
marked out by the original sponsors of
a league of all nations for all the world.
It suggested rather the. kind of alliance
of which Europe had known so much,
and America so little.
Now at the end of January it is ap
parent that the real League supporters
will unite with the confirmed isolation
ists in an effort to defeat the acceptance
of this pact by the Senate. And such a
development is in a political sense logi
cal and desirable. Nationalists and In
ternationalists are natural allies in op
position to Imperialists.
President Harding said in the address
at the opening of this Conference that
the United States wished less of arma
ment and none of war. It would be
heartening to democrats everywhere if
there would develop a public opinion
that would say to the present adminis
tration, let us have less of secrecy and
none of alliance.
