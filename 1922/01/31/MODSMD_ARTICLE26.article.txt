# CAPTAIN HAROLD COONEY IS MAN OF ACHIEVEMENT IN MILITARY PROFESSION
## 
### 
Captain Harold Cooney is a familiar
figure to those men who have been
under his instruction in the Reserve
Officers' Training Corps, and through
his tutelage of equitation classes, has
come to be well-known among the
horsemen and women of faculty and
the University as well. His short and
stocky frame houses a large heart,
and a ready wit which has won him
many friends, as well as making his
classes interesting and instructive.
Captain Cooney was born in San
Diego, this perhaps having something
to do with his sunny spirit. At any
rate, he passed his early years in
that city, attending the Russ High
School during the time before he was
appointed to West Point.
Although attending school, he be
came quite a business man on the
side, handling the circulation of all
three of the San Diego papers at dif
ferent periods. Through this work, he
became acquainted with many influ
ential men of the community, and
of other men who made San Diego
their home a portion of th'e year.
Through one of these, he was offered
the appointment to Annapolis in 1913,
but did not follow up the offer because
he did not know much about the naval
academy. However, when he was
offered the chance to go to West Point
the next year, he talked things over
with a former West Point man and
finally accepted.
After a year spent at the National
Military Academy a West Point prep
school, Cooney entered West Point
itself. Here he spent a very busy
three years and a half, being gradu
ated in August 1917.
Upon graduation, he was assigned
to the 18th Field Artillery at Fort
Bliss, Texas. From here, he was sent
to France, taking up a course as air
plane observer at Goundrecourt, a few
miles in the rear of the front lines.
Facilities for training were poor, and
consequently, a few weeks more found
him again with the artillery attached
to the first division, just landed in
France.
With the Third Division, he saw ser
vice at Chateau Thierry and subse
sequent engagements, following close
ly a brief artillery course which he
took at the school at Coetquidon.
As a reconaissance officer, Captain
Cooney acted as instructor to many of
the officers and men of the 91st Divi
sion, among whose regiments was the ,
"California Grizzlies." Such men as
Peter B. Kyne and Stewart Edward
White took courses under him.
After the Armistice, Captain Cooney
was sent to Polch, Germany, to join
the Third Field Artillery Brigade,
and was made brigade headquarters'

operation officer. Shortly after, he
was appointed aide de camp to Gener
al Cruickshank. Upon his return to
the United States, Captain Cooney
was sent to Camp Pike, Arkansas, and
in October 1920 was detailed to Stan
ford to act as Reserve Officers' Train
ing Corps instructor.
Captain Cooney is an army enthusi
ast, and a great believer in prepared
ness. For this reason, he takes a
keen interest in the training of the
men under him in the military courses,
an enthusiasm which has spread to
the many men themselves.
He likes his work at Stanford, and
he and his wife have made their
home in Palo Alto.
He is a firm believer in discipline,
so firm that he did a long spell of
extra duty at the Academy for hazing
the poor plebes—but that is an inside
secret.
Nevertheless, if all officers showed
the same mixture of smiles and
friendliness, with the dash of added
"pep" and Irish wit that Captain
Cooney exhibits, there would be little
need of fear that they could not
handle men without recourse to Prus
sian measures.
