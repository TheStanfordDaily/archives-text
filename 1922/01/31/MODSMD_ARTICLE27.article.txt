"Nip" McHose, the speedy Cardinal
forward, was the ace of the Stanford
point-winners on the northern trip.
McHose hal 36 points to his credit,
all of them being field goals. Jimmy
Davies was not very far behind his
running mate, as he tallied 35. Rich
mond came next with 10, and Janssen
contributed 8.
"Swede" Righter's College of Pacific
Tigers ran into real disaster when
they met the Missionites from Santa
Clara. Joe Aurrecochea's rough-and
ready cretv walked over the Method
ists, 29 to 8. It was the worst defeat
the Pacifics have suffered this season.
From a quintet that started the sea
son with poor prospects, the first-year
cagers have developed into a credit
able court machine, and they have ap
peared to better advantage in each
game. The drubbing the freshmen
handed Oakland Tech, holders of 12
to 10 victory over the Blue and Gold
babes, and the decisive defeat of
Lowell last Saturday night, make
Seay's charges favorites in the series
with California. The unusual height
and weight of the Babe team has had
a lot to do with their success this sea
son.
In their two games the 130-pounders
have shown little of the form and
speed that characterized their play
last year. It appears as if Koba, the
Japanese flash, is the man who can
' make or break" the team.
Idaho and Washington State are the
remaining obstacles in the path of
the University of Washington before
it can have an undisputed claim to
the Pacific Coast Conference title. Of
the two, the Staters are the ones most
likely to gum the works for "Hec"
Edmundson's lads. They showed their
real strength when they defeated the
University of California, and if they
can keep up the pace, they are likely
to make trouble for Washington
Although it is a little early to think
of candidates for the All-Coast five, J.
Fred Bohler of Washington State, who
does the picking for the mythical quin
tet, is in no onviable position. Boh
ler's main problem is whether the po
sition at center shall go to Sielk of
Washington or Hjelte of the Oregon
Aggies. When he decides that, he will
be confronted with the task of choos
ing between "Windy" Crawford of
Washington or Eggleston of California,
lor running guard. The former's play
ing in the recent Washington-Cali
fornia series, gives him the edge over
the California captain.
