# Sixteen Men on A Snow Man's Chest, Yo Ho, and a Cup of Coffee

"Oh! I think you're the meanest
thing. That all went down my neck."
That was the cry most often heard
on the Daily Palo Alto picnic in the
snow at La Honda summit, yesterday.
From the minute the staff piled out of
the old Cadillac fire truck, which
Comptroller Roth supplied, the battle
raged.
Temporary halts were called every
now and then for the purpose repelling
invaders and to eat the hot dogs which
were boiled in snow water by the com
missary department, Bill Evans. Most
of the time, however, there were about
twenty active combatants.
One of the party fell over a cliff,
suffering only minor wreckage. Pro
fessor Smith's fedora will strike dis
may into the heart of the Palo Alto
blocker. The income taxes of the
local cleaners will no doubt jump tre
mendously as a result of the party,
for that trailer could certainly throw
mud.
The general opinion was that the
more endowment editions there are to
be celebrated, the better.
