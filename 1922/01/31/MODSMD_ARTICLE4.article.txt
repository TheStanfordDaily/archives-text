# WEIRD DANCES HAVE EXOTIC BACKGROUND
## Samuel Mendenhall, '24, Will Give Original Interpretations; C. K. Field Elected 
### 
''Dance of Death" and "Dance of the
Dope Fiend" will be two of the impres
sive features of the Ram's Head show
next week. Both will be executed by
Samuel Mendenhall, '24, who is said to
be a real discovery in terpsichorean
talent.
Mendenliall's interpretation is entirely
original and unusual—if such mild ad
jectives can be applied to any part of
the production. Scenic, costuming, and
lighting effects will lie important factors
in the successful presentation of his
numbers.
The "Dance of Death" is in three parts
—typifying different manners of answer
ing the final call. Changing lights will
effect a complete new costume for each
of these divisions. The background will
be in the mysterious murderer's lair and
will be of deep purple, scarlet, and black.
The characters will be invisible except
when they speak, and then only their
faces will loom out in the darkness.
After considerable cogitation and clan
destine consultation, the committee has
practically decided upon a title for their
uuique and weird play. This title will
be revealed tomorrow.
The election of Charles Iv. Fi°ld, '95,
to Ram's Head Society was announced
today. Field figured in dramatics in
the early days of the University and
with some of his classmates wrctc a
number of original skits for presentation
here. As past president of the Bohemian
Club in San Francisco he has been con
nected with work similar to that of the
local dramatic society—the presentation
of plays and skits by an entire male cast.
