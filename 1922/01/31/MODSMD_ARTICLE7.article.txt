# SOPHOCLES' PLAY IS SUBJECT FOR INTERPRETATION
## Miss Dorothea Spinney Will Give Dramatic Reading In Little Theatre; Tonight 
### 
Did you ever go to the theater and
hear the whole play presented hy a single
person who interpreted the parts of all
tlie various characters, who changed his
personality in an instant and who did
this with such finish that you forgot
that the stage was not full of actors?
Miss Dorothea Spinney will give "An
tigone," by Sophocles, in this fashion in
the Little Theater at 7:30 this evening.
She will use the translation of Pro
fessor Dale of Cambridge.
When Miss Spinney was a little girl
she lived in Stratford-on-Avon, and
once attended a performance of Richard
111 given in this way. It made such a
deep impression on her that she never
forgot its appeal, and later trained her
self to do this type of dramatic work.
She has lived much in literary and mu
sical circles in England.
Her dramatic interpretations have cre
ated favorable comment all over the
world. The Oxford Times compares her
voice as one of the two most beautiful
in England. A critic on the Boston
Transcript says that her movements are
"figures restrained in gesture, noble in
outline, flowing from one loveliness to
another, like those remote forms that
seem to move within a sacred veil
molded on antique cup or jar in ancient
ways of beauty."
Miss Spinney has appeared at Stan
ford several times before and is well
known to Stanford people. She is here
this time under the joint auspices of the
committee on public exercises and the
Greek department.

During her visits to the United States
she has given readings at Wellesley, Har
vard, Yale, Princeton, and other insti
tutions of learning. She has made tours
of Canada and New Zealand and re-

cently has been giving performances in
Hawaii. In her native country, England,
Miss Spinney has appeared in Queen's
Hall and Steinwav Hall in London.
