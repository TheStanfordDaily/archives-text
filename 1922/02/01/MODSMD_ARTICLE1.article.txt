# COUNCIL ACTION MAKES ACTIVITY OF STAGE LABOR
## Final Step in Centralization of Dramatic Control Taken at Yesterday's Meeting 
### 
The Dramatic Council now has com
plete control of the Stanford stage, fol
lowing a decision yesterday to take over
supervision of labor, which has hereto
fore been is the hands of Sword and
Sandals Dramatic Society. The action
was taken upon recommendation of the
Executive Committee.
Now that control is centralized, the
council has announced a change in policy
for stage labor. The tryout system will
be used for all positions and the work
will be placed on a level with other stu
dent activities. There will be four pay
ing positions, those of stage manager,
electrician, scene paintar, and property
man. Successors to practically all these
places are needed now or will be in the
near future.
'"We have endeavored to give as many
people as possible an opportunity to work
on the stage in the past," said Coach
Gordon Davis today. "From now on we
want to make the opportunity even
broader. We want everybody, man or
woman, who desires to get 'behind the
scenes' and take part in a real college
activity and who will work, to let us
know immediately."
Davis is anxious that all such persons
write or telephone him immediately. He
will be in his office, Room 203, English
Building, every morning in the week
from 11 o'clock until noon.
The naw system will not be used for
the Ram's Head play which is already
under way, but will be inaugurated for
the English Club production on March 8.
Dramatic Council was organized two
years ago with representatives from
every organization wliicli uses the stage,
including the three upper classes, Sword
and Sandals, Masquers' Society, Kam's
Head, and the English Club. Coaching,
rental of the Assembly Hall, and the
services of a permanent business man
ager have been given to each organiza
tion free, upon condition that twenty per
cent-of the box receipts for each produc
tion be paid to the council. The costs
in every case have been less than under
the old system of independent manage
ment for each play. The council has a
permanent treasury and as a body decides
.upon all expenditures, which since its
organization have amounted to more
than $2,000. Yesterday's action is , the
final step in the centralization of au
thority.
