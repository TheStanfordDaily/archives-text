Stanford will have the shiniest shoes
in bootblackdom tomorrow. Old bro
gans that never suspicioned the ex
istence of polish or brushes, kicks long
since ready for the scrap-heap, hoof
cases grimy and mud-caked, and all
manner of footgear foisted upon us in
this shoe-wearing age will have a sur
face- you love to touch after the En
dowment bootblacks get through with
them.
Yes, tomorrow is the day when the
public-spirited celebrities and near
celebrities of the campus shine the
shoes of some two thousand students
at least once. Football men will make
passes at the clamoring customers,
dramatists will show them how, pen
athletes will do it right, and numer
ous other factions will make fractions
of the spare change.
Stand back, please, while more is re
cited. Finger nails are not to be made
to feel ashamed in the reflection of the
shining shoes. To preserve the pro
per balance in reflected light, dainty
manicurists will wield the Cutex para
phernalia. Many merry maidens, rep
lesenting every group from La Liana
to the Stanford Dames, will wax right
winsome in the modest emulation of
the mystic manicurist. Riot will run
rife while rollicksome roughs ruin
reputations roaring for room. Like a

cry for help, it will be a scream.
For twenty-five cents a throw, any
student is offered the opportunity of
making his pet personal aversion shine
his shoes. And any maiden venge
fuily inclined will be able to make it
uncomfortable for someone else's sec
ret sorrow while she wields the lethal
cutirle carver.
This rich revelation is the result of
a meeting of the Executive Committee
last night. The following men will be
found at their stands by the Law
Steps, tomorrow morning, unless the
committee picked a timid bunch:
Dan Evans, '20, Harry Borba, '22,
Tom Carskadon, '22. Dick Pershing,
21, Gordon Davis, '18, Dudley DeGroot,
'23. Dick Richmond, '21, "Red" Tau
zer, '20. Jim Davies, '22, "Bill" Evans,
'22. "Jim" Petrini, '21. "Flint." Han
ner, '20. Les Seib. '22, "Jim" Ross,
'23, 'Skee" Turner, '21, Grant Corby,
'22, Stoddard Atwood, '22, Howard
Brown, '23, A1 Taylor, '22, Art Wilcox,
'21, Bob Connolly, '22, Richard Mala
by, '23, Myron Higby. '22, and fifty
odd others who ought to sling a wicked
shoe brush.
The names of the women have not
been definitely decided upon. How
ever, when the bell rings for the 8
o'clock tomorrow, the manicure marv
els will be on hand â€”as many as are
offered to them for treatment.
