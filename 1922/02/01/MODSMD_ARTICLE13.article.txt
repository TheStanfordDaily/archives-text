# "Koo Koo Kubistown" Title Tells the Setting For Ram's Head Show
## 
### 
"Koo Koo Kubistown" —the title
finally decided upon by Ram's Head
Society for .its play on Friday even
ing, February 10, is no more surpris
ing than every feature of the produc
tion will be. The action all takes
place in this "Koo Koo Kubistown"
and ranges from the garrets of the
struggling artists to the palaces of
the reigning monarch and the caves
of malicious murderers.
The women's chorus has perfected
most of its steps, the men's chorus is
well under way, the orchestra is be
ginning practices, the songs have been
learned, the lines and characters de
veloped are being worked out —and it
remains only for Coach Lester Seib
and Musical Director Myron Higby to
unify these elements during the next
ten days.
