# FRESHMAN FIVE WILL PLAY PACIFIC BABES
## Seay's Court Squad Journeys To San Jose This Evening; Little Opposition Expected 
### 
A change of schedule has been made
which sends Coach Seay's freshman
basketball team to San Jose tonight,
to play the College of Pacific fresh
men.
Coached by "Swede" Righter, the
College of Pacific team, which is re
puted to be fast and tricky, should
give the freshmen a hard tussle. Two
of the stars of the College of Pacific
varsity are playing in the game to
night, as the rule against freshman
participation in athletics is not In ef
fect at the Mission College.
Coach Seay is taking nine men.
Those making the trip are: Alexan
der, Steele, Hooper, Grace, Houck,
Oliva, Driscoll, Middleton and Wisely.
They will leave at 6:15 from the Palo
Alto bus station.
Because of the absence of Sliipke,
the team may start in a different order
than in the last few games. It is pos
sible that Hooper may play running
guard, leaving the forward position
open to either Grace or Driscoll. The
other possibility is that Wisely will
substitute for Sliipke at running guard,
leaving Hooper at forward.
Practice last night was devoted ex
clusively to shooting baskets and to
formation and execution of plays. In
every department except one, the
freshmen have shown an improve
ment, but the forwards are still as
inaccurate as ever in their attempts
to find the basket.
