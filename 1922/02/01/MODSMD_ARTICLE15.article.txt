# FRATERNITY FIVES WIN TWO CONTESTS FROM HALL TEAMS
## 
### 
A basket in the last minute of play
brought an 11-9 victory to Beta Theta
Pi's squad in a court battle with Encina
East Fourth, last evening. Alpha Kappa
Lambda defeated Sequoia Two, 23-10.
I he winners used ten men during the
contest. With the score tied in the last
part of the game, the best players of
Beta Theta Pi went on the floor, but
were unable to gain much advantage, in
the last few minutes the "nine all" score
put a premium on a field goal, and both
teams were hitting a fast pace. A foul
by Encina gave their opponents an op
portunity to make a free throw. Ala
baster missed the free shot but took the
ball off the backstop and put in the
winning basket.
Alabaster ran up a score of eight
points out of a total eleven. In the first
half, he threw three baskets, giving his
team the lead at 6-3. The forward com
bination was strengthened a great deal
when Mannoccir and Granger were in
the game. Dole and Sproul alternated at
standing guard.
Mc√üurney was the mainstay',of the En
cina quintet. He played running guard
and covered the court in an expert man
ner. Horn, forward, was the highest
point winner for Encina. Carlson's
basket in the last half tied the score.
Alpha Kappa Lambda's smooth-work
ing five had little trouble in defeating
Sequoia, 23-10. The Alpha Kappa
Lambda team is built around Rawlins,
who justified his pivot position last night
by tossing six field goals. Cornell and
Howe complete the scoring trio. Cornell
made three baskets. This squad's team
work is superior to a large percentage
of the intramural fives.
Evers, Brown, and Morrison at for
ward positions did good work for Se-
