Due to the large number of students
liv ng in Palo Alto, whose residences
are scattered over a very large area,
and due to the shortness of time left
before the closing of the Student Cam
paign. in order to expedite the facili
tate a final and complete report from
the Division of which I have charge,
T request those men who have not. yet
been folicited by the 44 solocitors,
that they voluntarily bring their con
tributions to me at my home, 815
Cowper. Street, any time up till 10 p.m.

The report thus far is entirely satis
factory, comparing favorably w.th
those of the ether divisions, but we
must work faster and more thoroughly

paign in order to make a satisfactory
and successful close.
Time does not permit of our gohig

bit" by comnig to us.
