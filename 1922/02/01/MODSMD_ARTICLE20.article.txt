# Friendship

### 
The noblest incentive in man's life, it has been
called, the tie that unites him with his fellows, and
through this relation places him on a higher plane
in mundane endeavor- —the bond of friendship. It
is an inspiration which has ennobled society through
out all eras of our history and has given us a rich
store of immortal characters who represent the ideali
zation of this greatest of human sentiments: It is
the greater because it is a common feeling which
can be experienced by every one of us.
When one seeks to analyze his regard for his uni
versity and the allegience he holds toward it, this
attitude can best be expressed in the simple term —
friendship. It is that unseen tie we feel which is
ever becoming firmer and* stronger and binds us
not to concrete studies and the buildings which shel
ter them, or to forms of activity, or occupations or
traditions or associations, but to all these combined
which make up that intangible thing we call "our
University." So what one may call college spirit is
an ever deepening and warming friendship for his
chosen institution.
Friendship depends on appreciation, devotion, and
sacrifice. "A friend is one who would do anything
in the world for you"—just this is the definition we
would offer on the spur of the moment. Our friend
ship toward our Alma Mater is an individual matter
—it depends on how deep is our realization of what
association with her has done and will do for us, on
what our debt of gratitude is in return for all we feel
we have gained from her. But it is certain that no
one can help but feel this bond in some degree.
Now comes to us an opportunity to play the friend
in need to one of our greatest and most lasting
friends and benefactors. And the test of friendship
requires sacrifice and effort —as does every worth-'
while thing we attempt. Our aid goes directly to
ward maintaining the life of the University itself—
to what we recognize as Stanford. Again it is an
individual matter —the means at our disposal, in
volving a five-year term in which to fulfill our pledge
of friendship makes the effort easier. The appeal
of a friend can not be disregarded until we have
exhausted every resource in answering it.
