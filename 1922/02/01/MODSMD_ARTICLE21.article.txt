# Exit Commercialism
## 
### 
Whether or not commercialism has existed on the
campus stage In the past, it will have little chance
in the face of Dramatic Council's latest action and
the adoption of a new policy.
The change which follows the relegation of all
lal)or functions to the council means more than the
death of commercialism. It means the opening of a
new field of campus activity for the student who de
sires to be "on the boat." It means letting down the
final bar to the best results in dramatics, that of con
trol by a single group over any element of production.
It means considerable saving of money for classes,
societies, and the student body.
The Rev. Lloyd Douglas, of Ann Arbor, Mich.,
who saw "The Yellow Jacket" last year, remarked
upon the perfection of dramatics here to newspaper
men in the East. Outside comment shows that the
professional tone which Stanford productions are
rapidly approaching is bringing favorable reaction.
For material compensation there are four well
paying positions in stage work for which tryoutees
may aspire. Under the new system, these positions
will undoubtedly bring even more campus prestige
than they now have, in addition to being valuable
recommendation for work after graduation, in the
past, labor costs have made expenditure for more

visible effect prohibitive. With the assistance of
ambitious students who are willing to work because
they like to be in an activity, because they like to be
"behind the scenes," because they appreciate experi
ences and the opportunity for advancement to pay
ing positions, Stanford dramatics are on the way to
even greater development.
Coach Gordon Davis, a Stanford trained man, and
the Dramatic Council, have elevated dramatics to a
plane of genuine # professionalism, in the favorable
sense of the word. Designing, scene-painting, car
penter and stage work—all is done by students who
are putting in their best with a real desire to accom
plish actual results, and who, incidentally, are get
ting training of a valuable sort.
