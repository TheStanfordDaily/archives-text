Editor: Sir: â€”In answer to your
request for an expression of opinion
from a first-year man. I want to state
that I am heartily in favor of Fresh
man discipline, to a certain extent. A
thing worth having is worth earning,
and a Freshman will have a stronger
love for Stanford if he undergoes some
slight tribulation during his first year
here. My own opinion is that the
discipline is more effective if most of
the horse-play is cut out. I have never
felt quite so deep a respect for the
University as I did while working on
the bon-fire, but the "razzing" which
occurred later impressed me as high
school stuff, and seems undesirable.
Yours very truly,
STANFORD, 1925.
