### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, EU
GENE, Ore., Feb. I.—(P. I. N. S.) —
The student council at its meeting Jan
uary 27 went on record as favoring a
limited program for Junior Week-end
this year in order to do away with the
overburdening amount of work that falls
upon the students in putting on this
event. It was also proposed that here
after Junior Week-end guests be selected
from the high schools of the state on
the basis of scholastic standing, partici

pation in activities, and personality, and
j that they be guests of the university
; rather than guests of individuals or liv
ing organizations on the campus. Ac
| cording to the plan proposed, the person
| selected to represent his school shall be
a high school senior and he shall be se
lected through the co-operation of the
instructors of the school and the Oregon
alumni in the town.
The plan will be voted on at the next
meeting of the council.
