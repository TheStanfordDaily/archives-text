Alaskan Oil Fivlds May Be Uncovered
That vast reservoirs of petroleum are
locked beneath the tablelands of northern
Alaska, not far from the Arctic Circle,
is the belief that recent investigations
have led to, and President Harding lias
announced that he will soon make a pub
lic announcement of the discovery of this
hitherto unsuspected lot of natural re
sources. The proposition of exploiting
these fields of oil has come before cabinet
meetings recently, and large oil com
panies are becoming interested in the
problem.
The greatest difficulty lies in the lo
cation. Hundreds of miles nortli of the
northernmost railway, and in a bitterly
cold climate, these oil fields will not be
easy to reach for driling. But several
companies have spent and are still spend
ing millions in prospecting, and it is likely
that within a year or two the Alaskan
fields will become one of the world's
most famous oil deposits.
Foreign Debt Bill Passed
The bill for refunding the $11,000,000
foreign debt was passed late yesterday
by the Senate. The bill now goes to the
President for his signature. This bill
prohibits cancellation of any debts, or
the exchange of bondh of one nation for
those of another, and fixes the interest
rate at A l /> per cent. The soldier bonus
amendment was defeated.
Genoa Cosference Again in Trouble
The promoters of the Genoa Confer
ence are looking for a graceful manner
in which to postpone their meeting or let

the whole subject drop, according to re
ports from Europe. The refusal of the
United States to take part hit the plan
a blow from which it is not yet fully
recovered. The British arc evidently not
looking to the Genoa meating as of much
importance.
The Anglo-French relations are still
uncertain, and not in the best possible
state. Differences of opinion over the
Far East question are now making irri
tations between the two countries.
World Earthquake
The entire world was rocked one-
of an inch by an earthquake
occurring yesterday. It is thought that
the huge quake was caused by the earth
shifting its axis slightly, thus causing a
"slip," or shift in the earth's material.
The exact location of the center of dis
turbance has not been determined, but
it is thought that it i*Â«s probably a few
hundred miles off the mouth of the Co
lumbia River, and perhaps miles below
the regular ocean bed.
