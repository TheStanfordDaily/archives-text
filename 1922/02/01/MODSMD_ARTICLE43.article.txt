1 have seen practically every basket
ball game at Stanford and also our
games with California up there during
the past three seasons, and have thor
oughly enjoyed every one of them.
There is just one feature that has
crept into our rooting section at our
home games that I cannot enjoy or
understand. Why is it that the Stan
ford rooters "hip" and "whoa" every
one who for any reason must -walk
across the court, and yell "queener"
as loudly as possible at any man who
comes to the game with a lady? If the
failure to see any sense to this new
"custom" of ours was limited to my
self alone I set it down to my bone
lieadedness and let it go at that. But
every one whom I've heard mention
this practice, including the Graduate
Manager, coaches, and Professors have
expressed disapproval in no uncertain
terms. It seems to me that now, just
before the California game starts, is
a good time to think this over a little
bit and see if this is the kind of thing
by which we want outsiders to judge
Stanford students.
