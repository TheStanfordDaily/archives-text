# SUNDODGERS AND BEARS PREPARE FOR ANNUAL CREW CRASH
## 
### 
Crew on the Pacific Coast is rapidly
gaining the attention of the follow
ers of the water sports as the season
of practice approaches. Both the '
California and Washington crews are
striving to develop championship
crews in order that they may make the !
trip to the Poughkeepsie regatta. Last
year California ran a close second to
the Navy, after losing to Princeton
::i a dual race over a much shorter
distance.
The prospects at California are not |
f « bright foi a championship team as |
they were last year at the start of
the season. Coach Ben Wallis of the
Blue and Gold squad has only three
veterans back around which he is
building his varsity but he believes
that he will be able to fill the vaeanci- ■
es from material in last years second
varsity and from the first-year boat.
At the present time he has about
seven varsity boats and three fresh
man eights practicing daily on the j
Oakland Estuary. Dan McMillan, j
tackle on last season's football team,
is captain of the varsity boat.
At the University of Washington,;
Coach Ed Leader has cut all dead- j
wood in his varsity and fresh materi
al and has established a strict train
ing schedule. The Northerners have
thre varsity boats on the water since j
the cut was made. Washington has
practically a veteran crew back. Last !
year Washington was only defeated by j
the .Blue and Gold crew by five feet
in one of the closest races ever held on !

the Coast. Because of this close de t
feat the Washington wen are anxious
to turn the tables this year when the
annual race for the coast champion
ship will be held 011 the Lake Union,
in the North.
Two former Stanford men are now
rowing on the California second var
sity. Wesley Linstrum who captained
the '23 freshman boat is stroke of the
Blue and Gold boat. Chester Bowes,
who also held a position in the Cardi
nal boat during the last year of the
rowing game at Stanford, is also mak
ing a strong bid for a place.
