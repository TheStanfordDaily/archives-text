# VICTOR ARTISTS TO APPEAR IN SAN JOSE FOR GRAND CONCERT
## 
### 
A musical event of unusual impor
tance is scheduled for the Victory
theater on Monday, Feb. 6, when eight'
famous Victor artists will appear un
der the auspices of the Sherman
Clay & Co. and the Wiley B. Allen Co.,
of San Jose.
It is the exception rather than the
rule not to have a Victrola in the
home these days and times. And
every owner of a Victrola has his or
her favorite artist. But —it is quite
the exception to see and hear the
artists who make the records, to see
them in person after having known
them so long through the mechanical
contrivance and printed pictures. The
Peninsula music lovers will have this
rare opportunity at an early date.
Henry Burr is probably the best-
I known singer of tuneful ballads in the
j world today. His rich tenor voice has
thrilled millions of music lovers.
Billy Murray is known as the man
with an unusual gift of putting over
smiles. He lives each song he sings,
whether it be "Oh, by Jingo" or "Pro
fiteering Blues."
Frank Croxton, he of the big bass
voice, is large in stature but mild of
manner. Because he is a native of
Kentucky he is foundly referred to as
"The Colonel."
Monroe Silver is the man who first
made the "Cohen" stories so popular.
"Cohen on the Telephone" has been
heard around the world, and Silver's
new Cohen stories are sure to amuse.
Fred Van Eps, the banjoist, is six
feet tall, a college graduate, and above
all, a musician.
Other members of the party are Al
bert Campbell, tenor, who has gained
fame in duets with Burr; John Meyer,
baritone, who is a horticulturist, "al
most to a degree," as some of his
friends say, and Frank Banta, pianist,
and accompanist. The Sterling Trio
and the Peerless Quartet are composed
of members in the party and will ren
der to 'more fully justify the reputa
tion of this attraction as being extra- I
ordinary.
A special car to San Jose and return
may be arranged if enough applica
tions are received by Friday, 2 p.m. I
Reservations may be made by phoning
Mr. Comp of Sherman & Clay. Palo
Alto 861.
