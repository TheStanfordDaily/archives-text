Dear Editor—Take it from one who
knows, and knows that he knows, you j
have the right idea about the sore sub- |
ject of freshman training and treat it in !
a particularly well thought out and com
plete way in your editorials of the last
few days. The idea of the freshman
having customary duties and labors is 1
not the right thing to drill into the man
when lie comes to college, which may be i
the first time that he has gotten away '
from home. Then is the time he is sup
posed to do something of his own ir.itia- )
tive and without the thought that it is a
duty of the kind that he has been fixed
to for the past ten or fifteen years of his I
youth. He should be given the chance to
start off right in the first place, and to
think that he is doing the things which
are "customary duties" as his own con
tribution to the community's good. Duty
sounds bad from the start. In time of
great stress when our country entered
the world war there was a response to
the "clarion call of duty." or something
like that. That was duty in anothe#
sense. There was duty in the light of
one's being patriotic and owing loyalty
to his country and regard to himself.
But the duty was only a privilege ex
tended to the individual who might take
it or leave it, but in case lie did leave it
would be sure to incur the lasting dis
regard of his fellows and would surely
be smitten by the stings of conscience.
That was duty in the sense of loyalty.
Here there is 110 appeal to loyalty by
the element who still stick to the old
rule of the paddle and the tub. Their
vision is as short as the paddle they use.
There never will be any success in the
matter of making a man better than he is
by the application of force to his body.
Reason cannot he appl! :d with a snrk
any more than it can b° forced down
one's throat in the shape of the contents
of a cold tub. A man can be made to
mind, perhaps by th; continuous impo
sition of corporal punishment, but as
soon as he gets in a position where he
can exercise a hit of authority he thinks
immediately of the bid times he had
when a first-year man ard swears venge
ance on the first new comer that he gets
a chance to work out on. This idea is
one we have to get away from before
anything material can do accomplished
toward succi ss.
Your idea of ridicule is the thing
which will most satisfact irily c erve tlie
place. It has, always, on the outside, and
we are only ordinary people gathered to
gether here from all parts of the world,
so it is quite reasonable to supposa and
so it is quite reasonable to suppose and
tem of public opinion here would be bet
ter by a long shot than the one we have

had for so long, of "Hit me today il you
want; I'll get my turn when the next
frashman class comes in "
IMFOR JUSTICIi.
