# "ANTIGONE" IS GIVEN BY DOROTHEA SPINNEY
## Greek Tragedy of Sophocles Interpreted Before Large Audience in Little Theatre 
### Maurine Voerge, '23 
j By the power of her voice and ges
tures, Miss Dorothea Spinney made all
of the characters of the "Antigone" by
r Sophocles appear and live for her au
e dience last evening in the Little Theater.
Her voice has been compared with the
s two most beautiful in England. It has
a wide range and variety of tone, and
a deep resonance which is especially
suited to a Greek tragedy. In the chant
. ing of the choruses Miss Spinney brought
out, to best advantage, the ringing and
swelling qualities in her voice. She has
trained it for many years until she has
perfect control over it and it is so flexible
that she can change in an instant from
the part of the angry King Creon to that
of the supplicating princess, Ismene, who
is afraid of being condemned to death.
At times she had three different charac
j ters on the stage at once.
Miss Spinney's gestures were expres
j sive and well poised and yet so natural
I and simple that there was not a false
note or expression during the whole per
formance. It was by aid of her move
ments that she was able to change from
one person to another without the :>light
q est awkwardness or pause. The sim-
D plicity and lack of distortion in her inter
e pretation of "Antigone" made it seem a
c ! human tragedy really happening.
n j Her facial expression added much to
d rendering the characters more life-like,
r! During the scene in which the old blind
soothsayer warns the king of evil, he* -
v eyes were rolled back until only the
e whites showed, in perfect imitation of a
e blind man.
Miss Spinney worked the scene of the
i quarrel between Creon and his son up to
:! a climax which could not have been
s I bettered by two separate actors. Later,
j j when Creon carried in the dead body of
; j his son to mours over it, there was a
1 ! strong resemblance between this scene
f j and Robert Mantell's interpretation of
a I the final words of "King Lear."
1J There were no stage decorations ex
n i ccpt a tall burning candle on each side of
j the back of the platform. Miss Spinney
! appeared in a Grecian costume.
The translation made by Professor
! Dale of Cambridge one hundred and
j twenty years ago was used by Miss Spin-
I ney because, she said, "the stately English
Â£ i of the times suit this play remarkably."
