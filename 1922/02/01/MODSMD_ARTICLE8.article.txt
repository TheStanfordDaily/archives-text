# DEFINITE PLANS FOR NEW HOTEL ARE CONSIDERED
## Building Will Be Constructed Near Palm Drive Entrance and Leased by University 
### 
Plans for the new hotel which is to be
erected on the Stanford campus began
to take definite form today.
A conference was held between Comp
troller Roth, representatives of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce, and uni
versity architects. The proposed site for
the hotel is on the State Highway to the
right of the Palm Drive. Detailed draw
ings, including every tree on the pro
posed area, have been prepared and it is
expected that an announcement of the
definite site of the building will be made
within the next few days.
The decision by the Board of Trustees
of the university to grant a lease for the
project on university property is in line
with the policy of co-operation adopted
by this body. Definite plans for the
actual construction and financing of the
proposition are under consideration at
the present time, but they have not yet
reached a stage where they are ready to
be announced.
The exact size of the building, the
terms of the lease, and the method of
financing the project are yet but matters
for conjecture. Comptroller Roth said
today, however, that these matters would
be decided in the near future.
Owing to the lack of hotel facilities in
Palo Alto, the new hotel will Till a long
felt need at Stanford and will lit in with
the community expansion program of
Palo Alto. The new hotel will be one
of the first of its kind to be erected on
the campus of a western university, and
will serve to accommodate at least a part
of Stanford's many visitors who other
wise are compelled to stay in San Fran
cisco.
