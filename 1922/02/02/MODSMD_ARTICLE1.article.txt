# WARNER SHE CONTRACT TO HEAD NEW COACHING STAFF
## New Coach Ready to Take Charge Of Gridiron Practice this Spring 
### 
Glenn Warner, University of Pitts
burgh mentor, and the "daddy of them
all." is Stanford's new coach. Andrew
Kerr, freshman football coach at Pitts
burgh last year, is to act as head coach
at Stanford for the next two years, as
sisted by C. E. Thornhill, last year's
line coach at Center College. Roth
Kerr and Thornhill will work under the
orders of Warner, who is to act in an
advisory capacity until 1924, at which
time his contract with Pittsburgh will
have expired. Announcement of the ap
pointment of coaches by President Wil
bur through the Board of Athletic Con
trol last night did not include what the
salaries were to be.
President Wilbur and the Board of
Control made a contract with Warner
under which he is to act as Stanford's
head coach for three years after a two
year's term in an advisory capacity. A
two-year contract was made with each
of the other new members of the Card
inal coaching staff.
Both Warner and Thornhill are in
Los Angeles now and will appear on
the campus to take charge of spring
practice as sodn as they are asked.
Warner has agreed to come to Stanford
for both spring practices prior to the
time when he definitely takes charge,
and to keep in close touch with the
coaching staff on the campus while he is
in the East.
Both Kerr and Thornhill have played
football under Warner and understand
his system. Both have had experience
in coaching, and come recommended
highly by Warner himself.
The appointment of these three coaches
is an outgrowth of an attempt on the
part of the President and the Board of
Control to secure Warner for Stanford,
over a month ago, when it was thought
that the Pittsburgh coach was available.
Tt was learned, however, that his con

tract with the Eastern university lasted
until 1924. Warner was then invited to
visit Stanford and look over the ath
letic situation, lie accepted the invi
tation and spent several days on the
campus conferring with the President
and the Board of Control. Nothing
definite came of his visit before lit left
for Los Angeles, but the arrangements
have been completed since that time,
resulting in yesterday's announcement.

University athletic authorities have
been endeavoring for the past three
years to build up a system that will
place Stanford athletics on a par with
her sister universities. It is believed
that the appointment of a man who has
perfected a successful system ,as well
as the choice of two others who have
played the Warner system and under
stand it, will bring favorable results.
Spring football practice will prob
ably not begin until next quarter, un
less preliminary instruction in the new
system is considered desirable.
The statement made public by Dr.
I Wilbur is as follows:
"In pursuance of the resolution of the
I Hoard of Athletic Control, asking me
to make certain arrangements and ap
pointments, i report the. following:
"1. Mr. Glenn Warner, now connected
with the University of Pittsburgh, at
Pittsburgh, has accepted an appoint
ment as advisory football coach for a
two-year term and as football coach for
a three-year term thereafter.
"2. Mr. Andrew Kerr, now football
coach for freshmen at the University
of Pittsburgh, has accepted the position
as coach for a two-year term, with the
understanding that Mr. Warner will be
advisory coach during that period.
"3. I am completing arrangements for
the appointment of Mr. C. E. Thornhill
to act as assistant coach with Mr. War
ner and Mr. Kerr for aÂ»two-year period.
'"Very truly yours,
"RAY LYMAN WILBUR.
"President."
