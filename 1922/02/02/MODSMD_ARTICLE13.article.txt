# FOUR BASKETBALL MEN ON SICK LIST
## R. Richond Probably Out of Game; DeGroot, Anderson, Cleaveland Also Affected 
### 
Some malady, appearing as a dis
agreeable aftermath of the Oregon
trip, put out of commission four mem
bers of the varsity basketball squad, and
has disorganized the Cardinal quintet on
the eve of the iirst game with California.
Dick Richmond, running guard, and
one of the veterans on the Stanford
five, is confined to the hospital and ap
pears to be definitely out of the con
test Saturday night.
DeGroot, regular guard, and Ander
son, substitute guard, are both under
the weather with heavy colds and fevers.
Cleaveland, substitute forward, is re
ported to be under the care of physician.
DeGroot and Anderson were up and
about yesterday, but neither felt suffi
ciently well to practice. There'is a pos
sibility that both will be ready to play
against California.
Although the exact nature of the
sickness that has fallen upon the Cardi
nal players has not been determined, it
is thought that the four contracted some
form of influenza while in Oregon last
week. The same sort of illness visited
the ranks of the University of Wash
ington team immediately after its re
turn from a week's tour of Oregon.
There are reports in the northern cities
that influenza is again going the rounds,
although health officials deny this.
Even if DeGroot is able to play, it
will be a weakened aggregation that
faces the Blue and Gold. The expe
rience and aggressiveness of Richmond
is sorely needed on the Cardinal quintet.
It was a combination of chance and
misfortune that both of the running
guards fell victims to the illness. The
forwards and center positions are well
fixed, but the list of available guards is
extremely small. Should Anderson be
unable to play, Pitts will probably till
in at the running guard.
One ray of hope appears. "Lefty"
Roge.rs is fast rounding into shape and
