# Greetings, Warner, Kerr and Thornhill
## 
### 
Stanford's policy in regard to football for the next
five years lias been definitely decided by the hiring
of Glenn E. Warner. Warner has accepted the po
sition of Advisory Football Coach for a two-year
period, and that of Football Coach for three years
thereafter.
In the meantime Andrew Kerr, who is now fresh
man football coach at the University of Pittsburgh
with Warner, will act as Coach with the understand
ing that Mr. Warner will be advisory coach during
that period. Assisting Kerr will be Mr. C. E. Thorn
hill, who was the line coach for Center College last
season. Both of these men have been hired for two
years with the understanding that they are to do the
work involved in developing a winning team fof
Stanford under the advice of Warner.
Kerr and Thornhill both played under Warner and
know his system of football. Kerr has enjoyed the
usual prominence that accrues to freshman coaches
in any institution that enters into Intercollegiate
competition. Word received here from various
sources is to the effect that Kerr is a very capable
man and would himself make an excellent head
coach. Thornhill made a reputation for himself in
the coaching field as line coach of the Center College
team which has been so successful during the past
few years.
The fact that these men are so well versed in the
Warner style of football, both playing and coaching,
would indicate the institution of the Warner system
immediately. The added fact that Warner will su
pervise the work of these men directly during the
spring and indirectly during the playing season is
also a sign that the methods that have made Glenn
Warner known as the "daddy of them all" in the
world of football will shortly become Stanford
methods.
Danger that either of the two men will not give all
that he has or that they will disagree in any way with
the orders from Warner will be practically negligible
since the only style of play that they know is the
Warner system. Added to this that both of them
will probably want to remain at Stanford as assist
ants or that they might want to seek positions as
Head Coaches elsewhere is practical assurance that
they will turn to developing Stanford players along
Warner lines, and teams built to play the Warner
system, which are ordinarily very successful.
The wisdom of the President and of the Hoard of
Control in the settlement of the football coaching
question at Stanford is readily to be seen in the ar
rangement of this transaction. Warner is without a
peer in the United States as a football coach. The
acquisition of two men who were trained and coached
by him to do the coaching until he can take hold him
self is another long step in the right direction.
The great thing about the present arrangement is
that Stanford, which for three years has been with
out a system of any kind, now takes over a full
fledged coaching staff and a system that is already
successful and well established. For five years at
least our main concern will be with developing men
to form winning teams and not with trying to develop
a system and men at the same time.

that period. Assisting Kerr will be Mr. C. E. Thorn
hill, who was the line coach for Center College last
season. Both of these men have been hired for two
years with the understanding that they are to do the
work involved in developing a winning team fof
Stanford under the advice of Warner.
Kerr and Thornhill both played under Warner and
know his system of football. Kerr has enjoyed the
usual prominence that accrues to freshman coaches
in any institution that enters into Intercollegiate
competition. Word received here from various
sources is to the effect that Kerr is a very capable
man and would himself make an excellent head
coach. Thornhill made a reputation for himself in
the coaching field as line coach of the Center College
team which has been so successful during the past
few years.
The fact that these men are so well versed in the
Warner style of football, both playing and coaching,
would indicate the institution of the Warner system
immediately. The added fact that Warner will su
pervise the work of these men directly during the
spring and indirectly during the playing season is
also a sign that the methods that have made Glenn
Warner known as the "daddy of them all" in the
world of football will shortly become Stanford
methods.
Danger that either of the two men will not give all
that he has or that they will disagree in any way with
the orders from Warner will be practically negligible
since the only style of play that they know is the
Warner system. Added to this that both of them
will probably want to remain at Stanford as assist
ants or that they might want to seek positions as
Head Coaches elsewhere is practical assurance that
they will turn to developing Stanford players along
Warner lines, and teams built to play the Warner
system, which are ordinarily very successful.
The wisdom of the President and of the Hoard of
Control in the settlement of the football coaching
question at Stanford is readily to be seen in the ar
rangement of this transaction. Warner is without a
peer in the United States as a football coach. The
acquisition of two men who were trained and coached
by him to do the coaching until he can take hold him
self is another long step in the right direction.
The great thing about the present arrangement is
that Stanford, which for three years has been with
out a system of any kind, now takes over a full
fledged coaching staff and a system that is already
successful and well established. For five years at
least our main concern will be with developing men
to form winning teams and not with trying to develop
a system and men at the same time.

Stanford's policy in regard to football for the next
five years lias been definitely decided by the hiring
of Glenn E. Warner. Warner has accepted the po
sition of Advisory Football Coach for a two-year
period, and that of Football Coach for three years
thereafter.
In the meantime Andrew Kerr, who is now fresh
man football coach at the University of Pittsburgh
with Warner, will act as Coach with the understand
ing that Mr. Warner will be advisory coach during
that period. Assisting Kerr will be Mr. C. E. Thorn
