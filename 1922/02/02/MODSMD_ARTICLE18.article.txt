What was to have been an all-university party in
support of the endowment this morning turned out
to he a stag affair. "Thinking women" among the
leaders of the Women's Conference, prompted doubt
less by a sense of false modesty, refused to sanction
the participation of women in the shoe-shining and

I manicuring party, although the more thoughtful
among the live hundred were for the most part
strongly in favor.
The affair was staged not for publicity primarily,
but to infuse a little fun into the serious business of
collecting and interviewing for endowment pledges.
I Stanford women, whom we have come to regard as
real, integral parts of the student body, were kept
f;om participation by their leaders. Does this inci
dent indicate the retrogression of women students
from the part they have taken in all-university func
tions to the separate place they held not so long ago
as "the five hundred" ?
