This afternoon Stanford students are proving to
trustees, to alumni, and to the general public that
Stanford means more to them than a series of classes
that culminate in the granting of a diploma. To
morrow afternoon they are turning over the first
lump contribution toward a fund which is starting
their University upon another era of expansion and
progress.
What the amount of that contribution will be will
not be known until Student President Dan Evans
turns over the pledges to President Wilbur, interest
in their own affairs and curiosity, if nothing else,
• will prompt practically the entire student body to ap
pear for the ceremonies. There is still a considerable
amount to be raised to fill the student quota of
$200,000. Doubtless the final day of the drive will
bring greater results than the three preceding. But
no matter what the total announced tomorrow is,
the great majority of the student body will have the
saisfaction of knowing that they have done their best
* toward showing the world what Stanford really is to
them.
