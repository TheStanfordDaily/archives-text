## 
### 
Posters are out announcing the ap
pearance in the Assembly Hall on
Thursday evening, February 9, of Regi
nald Werrenrath, who is known as
"the prince of baritones." This will be
Mr. Werrenrath's first appearance in this
community although lie was received
with enthusiasm on his former visit to
San Francisco, when he substituted for
Corgoza on short notice for the Berke
ley Musical Association, was instantly
acclaimed as an artist of the first rank.
There is probably no American recital
artist who enjoys a greater popularity.
Local music-lovers have been promised
what will be one of the finest song-re
citals ever given in the Stanford As
sembly Ilall in this artist who will ap
pear in the concluding number of the
Peninsula Musical Association's series.
The popularity of Werrenrath has been
a thing of gradual growth, with his
own performance as his most effective
advertisement. Although critics give
the highest praise to his splendid voice
and artistic achievement, the greatest
secret of his popularity with American
audiences is because of a winning,
healthy, sane personality.
A few desirable seats not sent out to
regular subscribers of the Peninsula
Musical Association are now obtainable
at Grandad's Book Store in Palo Alto,
and even the side-section seats, sold at
a reduced price, should be in demand
for this concert, sincc Werrenrath's ar
ticulation is considered especially fine,
