Dear Head of Cabbage:—At last, at last, I got a con
tribution and it isn't bad! "Cobby" says:

ODE TO CALIFORNIA
Hush, little college, don't you cry,
you'll get a stadium bye and bye.
* * *
Meanwhile, here's to "Pop" Warner—"the daddy of
them all!"—the Dean of American Football Coaches! —
Skyrocket! !!
# ♦ *
It' Cal asks you what's the Warner system just tell
'em it's the Pittsburgh—kept in the dark.
Which reminds me of the old, old joke of the timid
reporter interviewing an Unappropriated Blessing some
where in the forties. He was sent to get her life story
and she was not talkative. After much fidgeting, the
reporter asked:
Where were you born?"
| "Pittsburgh."
"Ah, eh, when did you. eh, first see the light of day?"
"At the age of nine, when my folks moved to Phila
delphia."

Well, it won't take nine years for "pop" of Pittsburgh,
to send the Bruin Gold to the Sleepy Man's town.

The color of life was never so red as it is today.

A senior and a freshman, neither of whom I knew,
sat down at my table at the Union. The somb asked
the dink about everything in the "old hum town." Well,
it seemed houses were scarce and if you sold you had
no place else to move into. Further, there was an
epidemic of marriages. Nearly all the boys of the
senior's prep school class who hadn't gone to college
had since decided to make some little girl happy and
most of the girls of the class had not been adverse to
becoming happy. Several of his former pals were now
pushing wicker carriages. Encina Hall began to look
like an apartment house for confirmed bachelors and
there seemed to be 110 longer reason for placing Dr.
Gardner mid-way between it and Hoble.
Service, as usual, was slow, and I listened some
time to the conversation. Everything they had said
concerning the town was exactly the same as things
in my mother's birthplace. I became convinced they
had come from there. So when ice cream soothed to
sleep their desire to talk, I said:
"Aren't you gents from county?"
"No, never heard of it. We're from Ohio."
The moral? —I leave it to you.

If that isn't enough humor for highbrows for one week
we'll add their regular department:
Humor for Highbrows:—Hundreds of people all with
more or less of a college education, crowding into a
half-open door in the English-Economic-History-Etc.
Building between classes. Tradition does not seem to
permit, as it were, the opening of the other half of the
door.

Room-mate's sore at my flippancy. Busts in on me
with terrible news earthquake has wrenched earth's
axis. Reply: Guess these chiropractic people will offer
to fix it up O.K.
* * *
Why not be flippant tho? Because:
If you have had luck but if all of it's bad,
And you find the world grinning at you,
You better had laugh and stand for the gaff,
It's the logical thing to do.
Either WITH you or AT you the multitude laughs.
It's the regular thing to do,
And so show us a smile that will put you in style.
When the world laughs—why not you?
