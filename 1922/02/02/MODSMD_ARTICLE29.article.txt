UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA.
Minneapolis, Feb. 2 (P. I. N. S.) â€”'The
inventor of the famous "Minnesota
shift" is no longer the football coach of
Minnesota's eleven. Dr. T. L. Williams,
j who made for himself one of the most
respected names as a football stragetist
that ever appeared in this country, has
been succeeded by "Bill" Spaulding
from the Teachers' College, in Kala
mazoo. The change is the result of a
long slump in Minnesota football stand
ing. The "M". teams have for the past
three or four years been a negligible
factor in the Conference, ,and a change
was finally demanded.
