Conference Adopts Five Power
Naval Limitation Treaty
The Washington Conference has j
approved the five-power naval treaty i
and there remains only ratification by j
the senate to make it binding upon the j
United States. The naval ratio is
5-5-3, 1.75-1.75 for Great Britain, the J
i United States, Japan, France and '
I Italy, respectively. Replacements are
permitted but no new construction is
to be allowed for ten years. Air craft
carrier's tonnage is limited in like
proportions and fortifications on the
Pacific Islands are not to be increased.
The Treaty by the same five powers,
which forbids the use of poison gas
and attacks by submarines on merch
ant ships, was adopted. It provides
rliat in case a submarine attacks a
merchant ship, its captain may be
tried for piracy by any power. Other
ntates are invited to join with the Ive
contracting powers in pledging their
.idhertnce to this, tieaty.
Undoubtedly the world will accent
these international agreements with
joy and sincere gratitude to the states- j
men who nave brought ?hem about, j
The chief objection that can be rais- j
ed to them, which indeed is serious, \
is that only a limited number of states
are bound by the agreement and the
! rest of the world is ignored and placed
in a r.osM on of inferiority. If some
nation or group of nations should arm
and defy the world, it might be some
what embarrassing to tlv3 Fig Five.
This, however, is not like'y to u'v.r
in the present financial condition of
the world.
J Shantung Question
Settled
Japan has agreed to restore the |
leased territory of Kiochow and to
! relinquish its position of privileges
jin the province of Shantung. A joint
j commission will be appointed by Japan
| and China to arrange the terms of the
| transfer. All Japanese troops will be
; removed within six months.
The Open Door Policy
Acceeded to By Powers
Perhaps the most drastic incident
of the day occurred when Mr. Balfour
announced the intention of Great Bri
tain to return the port of Wei-Kai-
Wei to China. Wei-Kai-Wei is also
in Shantung and is held under lease
by the British. This announcement
was unexpected, and brought fqrth
hearty applause.
The head of the French delegation,
M. Sarraut, declared that France is
prepared to restore to China its part
of Kwag Chow Wan, which is in the
southern part of China, near the border
of French Indo-China..
China is nearer the realizations of
its ambitions than ever before.
Hughes and Balfour received the
thanks of the Chinese delegation for
the part which they have played in
bringing about (he Shantung settle
ment.
