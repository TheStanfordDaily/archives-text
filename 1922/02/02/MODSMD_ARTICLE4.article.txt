# MUSIC TO CARRY OUT IMPRESSION
## Opening Number of Ram's Head Show Will Typify Spirit of Extravaganza 
### 
Music in which the best composers
of the campus have attempted to carry
out the general impression of "Koo
Koo Kubistown," Ram's Head futuristic
show, will be an impressive element in
the production a week from tomorrow
night.
This spirit is typified in the opening
number, "She's the Queen of Kubis
town," written by Dick Malaby, '23, and
sung by the Ram's Head chorus.
"Hong Kong Wedding Day," another
of Malaby's numbers, will be particularly
effective, forming a sub-playlet in itself.
A full Chinese wedding will be pan
tomined by the complete cast, gorgeously
costumed. In this scene there will be a
special dragon imported from San Fran
cisco's Chinatown following an exten
sive search by members of the society.
There will lie a complete Chinese or
chestra. The entire setting will be
changed while the action progresses by
means of lights and special properties
which with unusual devices will be in
troduced without being seen by the
audience.
Many of the numbers are undoubtedly
destined to go down as Stanford song
hits. Russ Sewall, '21, has written a
peculiar number, "Cubist Blues," which
Ram's I lead men guarantee will en
rage the most aesthetic music lover. It
will be sung by Nelson Valjean, '24, and
Jordan Ownby, '22. a special soft shoe
dancing act being introduced with it.
A charming bit of dancing will be
found in Clarence Carey's "Candlelight,''
sung by Ned Prather, '23, and Dick
Pershing, '21.
C. W. Midgeley has contributed two
fox trots which have made a distinct
impression upon those who have heard
them. They are "Somebody Else" and
"It's the Way You Smile at Me." lie
, has also composed an operatic medle.y
which will be sung by a special lyrical
quartet, providing a feature that will
be both novel and amusing.
Myron Higby, '22, is the composer of
another quarter number, "Honeysuckle
Home," which lends itself particularly
to quarter harmony.
An entirely new type of fox trot is
introduced in Malaby's "Latin Quarter
Love," which has a queer haunting re
frain.
There are sixteen musical numbers in
all, the lyrics for most of which were
written by Dan Evans, '21, one of the
authors of "Koo Koo Kubistown." In
asmuch as Ram's Head has sought for
different effects, the new music will un
doubtedly prove as interesting as any
other feature of the decidedly queer
production.
