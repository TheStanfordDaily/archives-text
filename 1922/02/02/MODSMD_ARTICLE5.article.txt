# CARDINAL FRESHMEN WIN FROM COLLEGE OF PACIFIC QUINTET
## Seay's Team Shows Class In Defeating College Team By Score of 29-21 
### 
Duffy Seay's basketball squad has ac
complished what many thought was im
possible—they have developed a fast,
powerful, smooth-working team.
This was demonstrated last night
when the freshmen defeated the College
of Pacific team on their home court by
a scor eof 29-21. Included in the Col
lege team were four men who played in
the Stanford-Pacific varsity game on
January 15.
For the second time this year the
freshmen went up against a team that
was their equal in size and weight, and
even superior in their playing ability,
and defeated them by a substantial score.
Undoubtedly the freshmen have "ar
rived."
The first half was spent by.the Babes
in close guarding of their opponents,
while the forwards became accustomed
to the floor. The half ended 7-4 in fa
vor of the freshmen.

In the second half both Alexander and
Driscoll found the basket and fast pass
ing and difficult overhead shots were the
rule for the remainder of the game.
Wisely looped too long ones through
from center court.

Most of the credit for the favorable
score must go to the standing guard and
ceuter of the Babe team. Oliva and
Steele broke up play after play, and
held the forwards of the college team
helpless. Steele out jumped Martin at
center.
Coach Seay was handicapped to a cer
tain extent last night by the absence of
Shipke, running guard, and the lack of
an accurate forward to take, the place
of Hooper should he be moved to guard.
However, Driseoll, who was playing at
forward, played a sensational game, find
ing the basket from all angles.
Stanford — Hooper, Oliva, guards;
Steele, center; Driseoll, Alexander, for
wards.
College of Pacific—Knowles, Sumner,
guards: Martin, center; Kcenev, Bur
chatn, forwards.
