# PHI KAPPA SIGMA FIVE BEATS DELTA KAPPA EPSILON, 18-9
## 
### 
Phi Kappa Sigma basket men hit a
fast pace in the second half of their
contest with Delta Kappa Epsilon last
night, and took the long end of an 18-9
score. Alpha Delta Phi came within one
basket of blanking the Breakers, in the
meanwhile, piling up 26 points.
In the first part of the second half of
the Phi Kappa Sigma-Delta Kappa Kp
silon game, the former led at 9-5. Two
tield goals by D. K. E. forwards tied
the score. Shlaudeman tossed the ball
over his shoulder with one hand, and
Lyttle evened matters with a pretty loop
from the side.
After that the Phi Kappa Sigma five
hroke through the 1). K. E. defense, and
steadily ran up their lead. Thomas, cen
ter. was the most accurate shot, throw
ing four tield goals. Coulthurst was a
sure man on free throws, four of which
lie converted, besides putting the ball
through the hoop twice from the field.
Woodward showed his usual light and
ability in entering into most of the mix
ups. He also found the basket twice
for four of the nine points. Sentous
alternated at center and guard, playing
a consistent game at both positions.
Alpha Delta Phi's basket-throwing
carnival, with the Breakers' quintet
vainly attempting to stem the onrush,
left small doubt as to superiority in
league five. Dennis and Gerspn accepted
the job of running the field goal merry -
go-round. Dennis was responsible for
18 of the 26 points. Pollard and Ncer
did good work for the winners. The
Breakers five was runner-up in the in
tramural championship last year which
was won by Alpha Delta Phi. The lat
ter team seems to be in good condition
to take honors this vear.
