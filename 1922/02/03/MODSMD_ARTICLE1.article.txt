# Stanford and California Fives Meet Tomorrow Night
## CRIPPLED CARDINAL TEAM ENTERS FIRST CONTEST OF SERIES Game will be Called in Pavilion at 7:45; Blue and Gold Weakened By Loss of Larkey, Center 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketball machine, model 1922, traveling at retarded
speed, will race a California model of the same year, tomorrow night at the
Pavilion, in the first contest of the annual series.
For five years since the elevation of basketball to major sport standing
the quintets from the rival universities have met on the court. Thrice have
the Bruins emerged triumphant, but in the past two series a Cardinal five
has proved itself the better team.
Coach Gene Van Gent bore down hard on the remainirrg members of his
squad yesterday in the effort to weld together a smooth working machine in
spite of the necessary changes. . A light practice was held this afternoon to
put the Cardinals on edge.
The Stanford five that takes the floor tomorrow night will be a vastly

different aggregation from the Cardi
nal teams of the last two years.
Righter, Adams, and Mills are missing
and their places are filled by new
comers. It will be a quintet changed
even since its last appearance on the
local court, for the illness of Richmond,
DeGroot and Anderson at the last
minute has forced Van Gent to shift
his forces considerably.
Dick Richmond, veteran of two
championship teams, and Anderson,
substitute running guard, are definitely
out of the fracas. Although the Car
dinal coach will make no definite an
nouncement, it is likely that Pitts,
"handy man" of the squad will take
Richmond's place.
Whether or not DeGroot, the only
dependable standing guard on the
squad, will be able to play, depends
to a large extent on the football cap
tain's condition between now and to
morrow night. Van Gent is holding
Campbell and Smith in reserve for the
standing guard position.
The scoring machinery of the Stan
ford quintet escaped unscathed and
the forward and center positions are
stronger than they have been at any
time during the season. Captain
Davies, playing his last big series for
the Cardinal, is expected to bear the
brunt of the attack.
Davies will be aided and abetted
by one "Nip" McHose, formerly known
as a star forward on the 1924 fresh
man five. McHose has blossomed into
a real varsity star in the past month,
and he and Davies can move around
the court as rapidly as any pair of
forwards in the Conference.
Bob Janssen is due to start at cen
ter, with Howell in the offing. The
former freshman skipper plays fast and
hard, and Van Gent usually sends in
Howell to relieve him for a time.
Howell is a good defensive player, but
he has not located the basket to any
considerable extent so far.
Van Gent's "dark horse" is "Lefty"
Rogers. Rogers may go in at one of
the forward positions if his wrenched
linee can stand the strain. As lie has
not participated in any games this
year, the results of his entrance into
the fray are hard to foretell.
Old Man Hard Luck has not confined
his activities to the peninsula, for
Jeff Larkey, veteran center on the
Blue and Gold team, ;s unable to play .
on account of sickness Coach Wight
of the Bruins has 1 oen under the!
weather hiirsi Ix for the past week.
Even without Larkey. California is
favored to win by the basketball fol
lowers. Eggleston, running guard and
captain, LeHane, standing guard, and
Coop, forward, all fought a losing
battle against Stanford last year.
Talt, a sophomore, has displaced the
veteran Douthit at forward, but he
had a hard job turning the trick. For
spectacular playing Talt and Eggleston
are the California players to mark, al
though the latter is inclined to have
his good and bad days.
Comparative scores this season point
toward a Blue and Gold victory. De
cisive defeats administed Santa Clara
and St. Ignatius, coupled with Stan
ford's reversal at the hands of the
latter, are the main factors in convinc
ing the devotee of the "dope."
Although neither coach has an
nounced an official line-up, the teams
will probably take the floor as follows:
Stanford Pos. California
Davies (capt.).... F Coop
McHose F Talt
Jans sen c O'Neii
Pitts G .. .Eggleston (cp)
DeGroot G LeHane
Stanford Reserves â€”Cleaveland, Ro
gers, and Howell, forwards; Camp
bell, Smith, and Pollard, guards.
