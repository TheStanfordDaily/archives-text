# ANTICS OF CLAFLIN ALMOST DISRUPT REHEARSALS
## Koo Koo Kubistown" Seat Sale Will Start At Noon, Tuesday 
### 
Were there not thirty-odd other char
acters in "Koo Koo Kubistown," Paul
Claflin alone would be enough to furnish
a riotous evening's entertainment in bis
ridiculously funny characterization of
Bedelia, the Irish biddy of the Ram's
Head show which will be presented next
week, according to those who have been
following rehearsals. Claflin's antics
come near to disrupting rehearsals for
the show. When a character continues
to get laughs from the rest of the cast
after a week or more of practice, it is
usually a pretty good indication of the
sort of reception lie will receive from
the show-going public. •
'1 lie finale of the lirst act is sung to
the fair Bedelia. Claflin's Irish partner
is Bill Slieils, "the Chancellor."
The loose ends of the first act were
pulled together last night in its first com
plete rehearsal. »
I lie seat sale for "Koo Koo Kubis
town" will open Tuesday noon on the
campus and in' Palo Alto, it was an
nounced by Ram's Head this morning.
The prices will be $1 and $1.25.
