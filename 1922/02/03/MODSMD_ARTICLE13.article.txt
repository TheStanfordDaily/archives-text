## 
### 
Oakland High School will face the
Cardinal Babes tomorrow night in the
I basketball pavilion in a preliminary to
j the Stanford-California contest. The
| game will start at 0:45.
I Oakland High School has a team that,
while smaller than the Freshmen, is fully
! their equal in speed and aggressiveness,
| and is said to be even better in the scor
ing of baskets from field. However, with
j the Babes playing in the form that they
I have been showing in the last two games,
i Oakland should not prove a difficult op
| ponen t.
I Hoffman may possibly break into the
| game tonight. His knee, while still
weak, is strongly braced. With the en
trance of Hoffman into the line-up,
Coach Seay has two men on the reserve
list who are capable of flashy playing.
Sliipke and Hooper will alternate at run
ning guard, with Hoffman and Alexan
der holding down the forward positions.
This will give Seay the better part of
| two teams from which to pick, with
Driscoll, Alexander, and Hoffman as bis
three liest forwards, Hooper and Sliipke,
running guards, Steele and Middleton,
centers, and Oliva at standing guard.
Steele, Oliva, and Sliipke have de
veloped a three-man defense system that
\ makes the Babe basket almost impreg
| liable.
The Babe squad held a practice scrim
j mage with the varsity last night, and, in
i the absence of four of the varsity stars,
! held the second team to a tied game.
