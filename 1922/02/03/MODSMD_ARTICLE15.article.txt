# ENDOWMENT GIFT FROM STUDENTS GIVEN TODAY
## Assembly Held at 4:30 is Climax to First Four Days of Intensive Campaign on Campus 
### 
As a result of the first four days ,intensive campaigning,
Stanford's student body presented pledges for $95,965 to
the University, at a ceremony held in front of the Memorial
Court, at 4: 30 today, to celebrate the first step for the three
million dollar endowment fund. This total was figured along
with the percentages for each group at 1 p.m. By 2: 30 ap
proximately $10,000 more had been turned in which is not
included in the official amount of pledges. D. W. Evans, '20,
president of the Associated Students, reported Sequoia Club
as leader on the campus with 96 per cent. Encina and Roble

were next with 85 per cent each. The
record of the other divisions follows:
Sororities, 65 per cent; Fraternities
and Campus men, 48 per cent each;
Women Commuters, 45 per cent; Palo
Alto men, 32 per cent; Men Commu
ters, 28 per cent.
This was the initial announcement
made to the public of results in the
first four days' intensive campaign.
The total so far, raised by only 58
per cent of the student body, has prov
en that the $200,000 will easily be se
cured when every one has bgen inter
viewed. A continuation committee is
to be appointed, which will help to
carry on the second half of the cam
paign. This work is to proceed more
slowly and will take in all those who
ii
were not able to be reached.on short
notice. Regular workers are to con
tinue as before until the students on
their lists have been interviewed.
