## Assembly Held at 4:30 is Climax to First Four Days of Intensive Campaign on Campus 
### 
As a result of the first four days ,intensive campaigning,
Stanford's student body presented pledges for $95,965 to
the University, at a ceremony held in front of the Memorial
Court, at 4: 30 today, to celebrate the first step for the three
million dollar endowment fund. This total was figured along
with the percentages for each group at 1 p.m. By 2: 30 ap
proximately $10,000 more had been turned in which is not
included in the official amount of pledges. D. W. Evans, '20,
president of the Associated Students, reported Sequoia Club
as leader on the campus with 96 per cent. Encina and Roble

were next with 85 per cent each. The
record of the other divisions follows:
Sororities, 65 per cent; Fraternities
and Campus men, 48 per cent each;
Women Commuters, 45 per cent; Palo
Alto men, 32 per cent; Men Commu
ters, 28 per cent.
This was the initial announcement
made to the public of results in the
first four days' intensive campaign.
The total so far, raised by only 58
per cent of the student body, has prov
en that the $200,000 will easily be se
cured when every one has bgen inter
viewed. A continuation committee is
to be appointed, which will help to
carry on the second half of the cam
paign. This work is to proceed more
slowly and will take in all those who
ii
were not able to be reached.on short
notice. Regular workers are to con
tinue as before until the students on
their lists have been interviewed.
"Not since the day when the news that
the University had won the suit against
it and would continue to live and grow
lias the campus seen such a meeting as
this." said President Wilbur in accepting
the gilt on behalf of the University.
"Then lines came marching from Koble,
Encina, and all parts of the campus to
meet on the quadrangle and celebrate a
decisive Stanford victory. This assembly
marks just as decisive a point in Stan
ford's history. It warms the heart of
everyone who loves Stanford to know of
this great unselfish support of the Uni
versity by the student body. It means a
fresh impulse toward the future and its
results will be of great advantage in all
the years to come.
"As President of Stanford University
I accept these pledges and gifts toward
The First Million for Stanford with un
usual feelings of pride and gratitudeâ€”
pride because of your great and hearty
service, and gratitude for your generosity
and help. You have built a new concep
tion of Stanford in the minds of your
selves, the alumni, and the public. I con
gratulated you on having such an oppor
tunity, and now I congratulate you on
the way in which it has been met."
Dr. David Starr Jordan, Chancellor
Emeritus, told the story of the financial
conditions of the University from its
founding. He showed how the demands
on higher education have grown 'vastly
greater, so that now the great institutions
of the country, such as Harvard, Yale,
and other endowed colleges of the East,
have from three to four times the re
sources they used to. Since the war. Dr.
Jordan continued, students have found
that the only way to success was through
training.
"People have not realized that the Uni
versity was in need of money," he said.
"As a matter of fact, we have never had
enough to do the things we wanted to.
Tf Stanford is to expand, and to meet
the increased demands made upon it. it
must have .air addition to the endow
ment."
The students gathered by living groups
at the Union, and marched to the front
of the quad, led by the hand and workers
in the campaign. They were met at the
Memorial Court steps by President Wil
bur, Dr. Jordan, departmental heads, ad
ministrative officers, and members of the
faculty. Following the report, D. W.
Evans, representing the A. S. S. U.,
handed over the total pledges to* Presi
dent Wilbur. News cameramen took mo
tion pictures of the gathering.
Concluding the ceremony, the body of
students grouped on the lawn and drive.-
ways gave several of Stanford's songs,
