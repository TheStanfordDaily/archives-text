# Winter's Big Game
## 
### 
It is not very far back to the days when the annual
football game between Stanford and California was
considered the one classic contest of the year. One
by one the five other major sports have risen into
varying degrees of importance.
Basketball of recent years has developed from com
parative obscurity to the most popular of winter
sports. The rapid action, the proximity of ,the spec
tators to the play, and the high degree of skill required
account for its popularity.
For the past two years Stanford has been a win
ner in basketball. On the eve of the California game
this year Stanford finds her quintet on the short end
of the odds. Coach Van Gent has seen the team
which he has developed around the two veterans dis
organized by the sickness of four members of the
first squad.
Hut Stanford is not yet beaten, for no game was
ever played on paper or in conversation. The very
fact that she is the underdog in the game tomorrow
night, with everything to win and nothing to lose, is
itself a point in favor of the Cardinal. Not until the
game is over and California has won, can any Stan
ford man afford to say that his team is beaten.
