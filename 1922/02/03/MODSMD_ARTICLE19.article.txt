# Interest in Nominations
## 
### 
Nominations are now in order for most of the
student body and all the class offices for the rest of
the year. This ought to create interest among the
members of the student body, for the men and wom
en who will find these offices will handle the activi
ties of the undergraduate body here for the next
few months.
In the past few years it has always been the case
iti mid-winter elections that but few nominations
were turned in, and the men or women who were
candidates have been elected, for the most part, on
white ballots. This lack of competition shows a want
of interest in the University's welfare that is not
Incoming to a group whicfi prides itself on its interest.
In the class offices there is a particular lack of nomi
nations. It can not be that among several hundred
people in every class there is only one person fit to
take the office of president or treasurer.
Healthy competition inspires the leaders in their
offices to discharge their duties satisfactorily. 1 f the
offices are set at a premium and made difficult to at
tain, the men who fill the jobs will work in an in
terested manner, and strive to put something into
their places instead of merely securing the distinction
of having once been a "class officer."
