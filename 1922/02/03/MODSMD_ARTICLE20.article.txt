It conies once within the province of each editor
to write an editorial on roughing. Thus far this
year, roughing which is an entirely local practice, has
l»een so well conducted that no complaints have been
heard on the behavior of the rough at campus func
tions.
However, it appears that the Stanford rough has
carried this practice off the campus and into places
where it is not wanted. Roughing receives justifica
tion only in the fact that we countenance it at our
own functions. More than countenancing it. we re
gard it as a real part of each campus dance. Provi
sion is always made for the onlooker. But when we
rough at functions off the campus we immediately
fall into the nuisance class.
Stanford students never intend to be nuisances, nor
to make their presence anywhere obnoxious, and it
is probably thoughtlessness, or force of habit, that
has caused Stanford men to rough in places off the
campus. It is well to remember that roughing at
Stanford is an accepted-feature of every function,
but that it is not so recognized in other places.
