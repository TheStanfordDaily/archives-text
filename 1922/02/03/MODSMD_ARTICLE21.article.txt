That "a little nonsense now and then si relished by the
best of men" is reason enough for the length and the
breadth of the Cabbage Colyum, but when it considers
itself the Court Fool, with the traditional freedom of
speech of such, and aims to supplement Ye Editor by
accomplishing by ridicule what argument often can not,
it has a surplus of justification for existence. Yes
terday Cabbages, under its weekly department, "Humor
for Highbrows," subtly smiled at the fact that the door
in the English building through which the greatest traf
fic of the University passes, has always been only half
open. Today, for the first time in history, traffic was
expedited by the opening of the other half. Hail to
Cabbages' "Open Sesame."
We are Modest; We Bow; Thank You!
When poets used to write about,
Pair maids and knights quixotic,
They used to turn their romance out.
In manner alcoholic.
But now the "vin" is put t orout,
With such Boliemic frolic,
For tho their works were good, no doubt.
Their means were idiotic.
So if the near-wines that they tout
Give to your muse the colic,
Just take a drink both hale and stout—
The acid marked: Carbolic.—Thursday

The guy that placed a sign on his orchard to the effect
that "FRESH PRUNES TURN IN HERE" may have
had a sense of humor.
Popular superstitions: That "Spencer's Philosophy of
Style" is a clothes catalogue. (English majors only.)
Our good friend, E. P., points out that it is a big
mistake for a chicken to say "I'm game."
Snake One —There must be something wrong with my
hair-oil. My hair fell forwards instead of backwards
when I put the stuff on this morning.
Snake Two—Maybe you put it on backwards.

Ye Cabbage Ed drags out the hoe.
And. says that he would like to know,
Just why the women acted so.
In helping the ENDOWMENT.

The campus men, both small and great,
Were helping dollars circulate.
They worked from early until late,
With evident enjoyment.

Where were the co-eds? Modest, shy,
They turned away averted eye,
"Such foolishness is not for I,
For we must be exclusive!"
* * *
We'll hope the next chance that they get,
To be a loyal Stanfordette,
That there's one thing they'll not. forget:
Don't be so darned inclusive.

We rise to remark that at least California's Stadium
isn't washing away. Wasn't it Burns who said, "The

y UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. LAST NIGHT.—
(Peanut Interests News Spreader).—Andy Smith, the
popular coach of California's Bear team, was inter
viewed about Stanford and her new coach. He said, in
part:
"If California retains her present coach, nobody
need fear nothing. I don't. But with 10,000 stu
dents to pick from, we have nothing to fear. I fear
nothing. There is nothing to fear. For remember —
it. will be many long years before the Stanford
rooters ever serpentine in California's Stadium. We
have nothing to fear."

A woman picks her clothes for style, a man for com
fort, but nobody knows why they pick each other.

Did you know that: —With all the water in the*ocean.
you have to go out three miles to get a drink.

With stately mien and prideful face.
The lordly male can keep his place,
'For man is great, and women small.
He's independent of them all.
But 'twere not thus in ages past,
Man hung to woman, tight and fast,
She graced his home, with grace and ease,
Man came to her on bended knees.
'Twas not the power or love of home,
That held man fast, as in a tomb,
But it was hard necessity,
FOR SHE MUST DARN HIS SOX, YOU SEE.
But now man flits as free as air.
The age-old fear no longer there.
Because improved machinery.
Can darn his sox, and do it free.

The following is an excerpt from the Classified ads:
"IF THE YOUNG LADY who dropped her gold-trimmed
fountain pen in her dash through the orange grove to
the English building for an 8-o'clock this morning, will
call at the Business Office of the Daily Palo Alto, to
morrow, between 1 and 1:30, she may have same."
The big question is: Which? The orange grove and
the English building, are immovable, the 8 o'clock is
already past, the Daily, according to the campus wags,
is not acceptable, and the dash was already hers. What's
to be gained?

We were going to spring some jokes the boss is against
since we're electing a new editor today, but the lino
type operator won't stand for it.
