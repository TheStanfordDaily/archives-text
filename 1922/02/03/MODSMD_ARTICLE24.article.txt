# TRI-STATE DEBATE WILE BE IN MARCH
## 
### 
Friday, March 3, is the date set for the
Tri-State Debate between the University
of Washington, the University of Ore
gon, and Stanford University. The ques
tion chosen for this year's debate is.;
"Resolved, that Congress should levy a !
tax on manufacturers' sales."
Emmet McCaffery, '24, and Bertrand
Comparet, '24, compose the negative
team that will go north to meet the Uni
versity of Washington at Seattle. Harold
Fendler, '22, and Leland Stanford, '24,
will remain here and meet the team from
the Universitv of Oregon. John Hall,
'25, is the alternate on the negative team,:
| and Bert Levit, '24, is the affirmative al
[ ternate.
Members of both teams are meeting
daily ii\ Room 200, which hag recently
been set aside by the English department
exclusively for the use of debaters. In
view of the present shortage of class
rooms, this is a substantial recognition
of the value and importance of inter
collegiate debating. A personal element
of interest is added to the debate by the
fact that the Washington team is coached
by a former Stanford man, Carl Leib,
while the Stanford team is also coached
by a Stanford alumnus. Professor J. G.
Emerson, '15 (Law) of the English de
partment. Two years ago Washington
won this debate while last year the de
cision went to Stanford; so this year's
contest will break the tie.
