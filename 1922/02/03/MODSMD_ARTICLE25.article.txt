UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 3.—(P. I. N. S.)
—"Andy" Smith favors Strawberry
Canyon as a site for the California Me
morial Stadium. The coacli explains
his views as follows: "We want the
stadium finished as soon as possible.
With Strawberry Canyon, architects tell
us that the structure would be finished
in time fur next year's Big Game.
"Not only that, the canyon offers a
much cheaper site. Getting the property
first proposed for the stadium would
take a long time and would involve the
student body in expensive lawsuits. The
A. S. U. C. would go into debt seven
or eight hundred thousand dollars if the
first plans were followed out."
