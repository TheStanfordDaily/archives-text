UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA, Feb.
3.—(P. I. N. S.) —Paddles and black
paint will appear here as means of pun
ishing the offenders of the campus cut
ting rule. All offenders will be pun
ished and there will be no distinction
made between freshmen and seniors. A
woman caught breaking this tradition
will have her nose painted black so that
the campus may see that she has broken
the tradition.
