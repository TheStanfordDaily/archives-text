# VARSITY SOCCERITES MEET OLYMPICS
## Varsity Is In Good Shape to Take League Championship From Winged "O" Eleven 
### Louis L. Bucklin, '24 
Stanford's soccer varsity will meet
| the Olympic Club on the iield of deadly j
battle tomorrow in San Francisco.
Those few words alone tell the story,
j for the Olympic Club is the chief rival
jof the Cardinal soccerites, and both
J teams are out to do or die. It will be a
i real contest from start to finish.
Everything can be won or lost by this
game. It is the crisis in the University
and Club Soccer League. If Stanford
wins this game, its place at the head of
the soccer league will be undisputed.
Should the Cards fail to come through
with the goods, a break either way would
win or lose the league for Stanford. A
tic would give the varsity a single point
lead in the league providing that each
team plays as consistently as it has in
the past.
Stanford's fighting spirit is up, and it
looks as though the Olympics would I
meet their Waterloo. Not that the game"
will be a walk-away, but the simple fact
that the Barbs got theirs 5-0, shows that
the varsity will tolerate no fooling. The
San Franciscoans, it is said, will throw
their Sunday reserves into the game, and
it will take all that the Stanford players >
have, to win, but the boys will come I
through—they always have.
In the first game with the Olympic
Club, the varsity squad had a hard time j
to hold them to a tie. But the team this i
quarter is a much improved aggregation, i
and while the Maloneyites miss Peavy in J
the forwards and Hayes in the backfield j
a new found ability to rush and follow j
their kicks for the goal gives them
greater strength. The teamwork of tht 1
entire squad has improved greatly, and |
the forwards are receiving wonderful !
support from the backfield, which is '
probably the best in the league.
Captain Bill Gorman has been out dur- j
ing the past week with an injured knee,
but in all probabilities he will be able to j
mix in the play tomorrow. Porky J
Dwight and Tommie Green, playing in- i
side and outside right, respectively, have
been going great guns, as have Garry
Elmore and Pat Carey on the other side
of the forward line. George Clark at
center forward wields a nifty boot and
gives a greater strength to the line. Cap
tain Gorman at right half, Pete Franklin '
•at the key position .and either Walthers
or Taylor at left half make a halfback
line that would fit in any team. For
fullbacks the Cardinals have Mondonca
and Clark or Robinson. Al Masters,
protecting the goal, completes a team
which so far during the season has not
been beat«n and which gives promise of
playing an undefeated season.
It is go<*l-bye California in the soccer
world for this season, at any rate. Cali
fornia. because of the two games it lost
to the Olympic Club, is out of the run
ning for the championship. The Bears
have a formidable aggregation, and the
varsity will have a hard job on its hands J
when it tackles them. Even should the !
Cardinal players lose this game, the Blue j
and Gold's best hope is to finish third.

wins this game, its place at the head of
the soccer league will be undisputed.
Should the Cards fail to come through
with the goods, a break either way would
win or lose the league for Stanford. A
tic would give the varsity a single point
lead in the league providing that each
team plays as consistently as it has in
the past.
Stanford's fighting spirit is up, and it
looks as though the Olympics would I
meet their Waterloo. Not that the game"
will be a walk-away, but the simple fact
that the Barbs got theirs 5-0, shows that
the varsity will tolerate no fooling. The
San Franciscoans, it is said, will throw
their Sunday reserves into the game, and
it will take all that the Stanford players >
have, to win, but the boys will come I
through—they always have.
In the first game with the Olympic
Club, the varsity squad had a hard time j
to hold them to a tie. But the team this i
quarter is a much improved aggregation, i
and while the Maloneyites miss Peavy in J
the forwards and Hayes in the backfield j
a new found ability to rush and follow j
their kicks for the goal gives them
greater strength. The teamwork of tht 1
entire squad has improved greatly, and |
the forwards are receiving wonderful !
support from the backfield, which is '
probably the best in the league.
Captain Bill Gorman has been out dur- j
ing the past week with an injured knee,
but in all probabilities he will be able to j
mix in the play tomorrow. Porky J
Dwight and Tommie Green, playing in- i
side and outside right, respectively, have
been going great guns, as have Garry
Elmore and Pat Carey on the other side
of the forward line. George Clark at
center forward wields a nifty boot and
gives a greater strength to the line. Cap
tain Gorman at right half, Pete Franklin '
•at the key position .and either Walthers
or Taylor at left half make a halfback
line that would fit in any team. For
fullbacks the Cardinals have Mondonca
and Clark or Robinson. Al Masters,
protecting the goal, completes a team
which so far during the season has not
been beat«n and which gives promise of
playing an undefeated season.
It is go<*l-bye California in the soccer
world for this season, at any rate. Cali
fornia. because of the two games it lost
to the Olympic Club, is out of the run
ning for the championship. The Bears
have a formidable aggregation, and the
varsity will have a hard job on its hands J
when it tackles them. Even should the !
Cardinal players lose this game, the Blue j
and Gold's best hope is to finish third.
Stanford's soccer varsity will meet
| the Olympic Club on the iield of deadly j
battle tomorrow in San Francisco.
Those few words alone tell the story,
j for the Olympic Club is the chief rival
jof the Cardinal soccerites, and both
J teams are out to do or die. It will be a
i real contest from start to finish.
Everything can be won or lost by this
game. It is the crisis in the University
and Club Soccer League. If Stanford
wins this game, its place at the head of
the soccer league will be undisputed.
