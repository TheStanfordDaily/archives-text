survey of his trip, "1 followed spring
from the tropics to the south, finding a
variety of wild flowers in the western
coastal regions. The study of where this
vegetation originated and how and where
it has spread, is a matter of growing in
terest today. The eucalyptus, acacia, and
many common plants are known to have
originated there and have been trans
planted to other countries. Likewise, the
cypress of California does well in Aus
tralia."
Leaving Australia, he spent a month
in New Zealand, studying in particular
forest vegetation.
"In Tahiti it is a simple problem to
pick one's dinner from a tree." he con
tinued, speaking of his month's visit
