Japan Makes a ,Concession
The Japanese delegation made another
bid for world approval by abandoning
certain rights in China held under the
treaty of 1915, the treaty of the twenty
one demands. There is no «ueh giving
up of privileges as the British delegation
announced yesterday in regard to Wai-
Hei-Wai, but the monopoly of conces
sions in Mongolia has been surrendered,
and Japan announces that she does not
intend to insist on the appointment of
Japanese advisers to the government in
that province. The famous "gruup five"
of the twenty-one demands, which would
have guaranteed Japanese domination of
China by requiring the employment of
Japanese advisers, political, financial, and
military, to the central government, es
tablishing a joint Chino-Japanese arsenal,
and extending joint police power over
certain areas to Japan, was never signed
by China at all. But Japan, in signing
the treaty of 1915, "reserved the right"
to press for the acceptance of "group
five" at some future time. Japan has
now abandoned this right to press for
the acceptance of certain unfulfilled de
mands, but in view of the fact that she is
: already pledged to the Conference to
seek no more special privileges in China,
today's concession is not of such great
importance. Feeling against foreigners
is running high in China as a result of
the failure of the Conference to satisfy
Chinese desires. The anti-alien demon
strations have been directed against
Americans as well as Japanese, for it is
felt that America has betrayed the in
terests of China in sigiiing the four
power pact.
In Congress
The offer of Henry Ford to complete
and operate the nitrate plant at Mussel
Shoals was tranmitted to Congress with]
a non-committal note by Secretary
Weeks. Although he did not definitely
recommend the acceptance of the offer,
he suggested that the unemployment sit
uation be recognized as a factor in mak
ing the decision. Secretary Mellon ap
peared before the House Ways and
Means Committee, to urge that no pro
ceeds of foreign loans he used to finance
the soldier bonus, that no additional issue
of treasury certificates be made for that
purpose, and that no action be taken at
all upon the bonus at this time. .New in
ternal taxes would be necessary to meet
the cost of the bonus, he said, since the
present taxes are already abnormally
high for peace time.
The Italian Cabinet, headed by Bon
ami, has resigned. Its fall is due to 'the
failure of the government to secure the
inclusion of Italy in the four-power pact
on questions relating to the Pacific,, and
to the conciliatory attitude taken toward

the Papacy on the occasion of the death
of the Pope, when the Minister of Agri
culture was sent to the Vatican to inquire
after the health of the Pope during his ill
ness, and the Hags on government build
ings were flown at half mast after his
death. The resignation of the. Bonami
Cabinet will doubtless give another blow
to the Genoa Conference prospect. Mean
while the conclave for the election of the
new Pope has begun.
Germany has begun to pay for the
frenzied era of bogus prosperity brought
on by rising prices and the falling mark.

The railroads of the country are com
pletely tied up by a national railroad
strike, and the Ebert government is tak
ing all possible precautions to prevent a
revolution. The railway employees de
mand a 40 per cent increase in pay on
account of the increase in the cost of liv
ing. The government frankly admits
that the demand is justifiable but pro
tests that there is no money to pay it.
Thus the burden of reparation payments
continues to lower the standard of living
of the German workman, and there
seems no way out.

inclusion of Italy in the four-power pact
on questions relating to the Pacific,, and
to the conciliatory attitude taken toward

the Papacy on the occasion of the death
of the Pope, when the Minister of Agri
culture was sent to the Vatican to inquire
after the health of the Pope during his ill
ness, and the Hags on government build
ings were flown at half mast after his
death. The resignation of the. Bonami
Cabinet will doubtless give another blow
to the Genoa Conference prospect. Mean
while the conclave for the election of the
new Pope has begun.
Germany has begun to pay for the
frenzied era of bogus prosperity brought
on by rising prices and the falling mark.

The railroads of the country are com
pletely tied up by a national railroad
strike, and the Ebert government is tak
ing all possible precautions to prevent a
revolution. The railway employees de
mand a 40 per cent increase in pay on
account of the increase in the cost of liv
ing. The government frankly admits
that the demand is justifiable but pro
tests that there is no money to pay it.
Thus the burden of reparation payments
continues to lower the standard of living
of the German workman, and there
seems no way out.
Japan Makes a ,Concession
The Japanese delegation made another
bid for world approval by abandoning
certain rights in China held under the
treaty of 1915, the treaty of the twenty
one demands. There is no «ueh giving
up of privileges as the British delegation
announced yesterday in regard to Wai-
Hei-Wai, but the monopoly of conces
sions in Mongolia has been surrendered,
and Japan announces that she does not
intend to insist on the appointment of
Japanese advisers to the government in
that province. The famous "gruup five"
of the twenty-one demands, which would
have guaranteed Japanese domination of
China by requiring the employment of
Japanese advisers, political, financial, and
military, to the central government, es
tablishing a joint Chino-Japanese arsenal,
and extending joint police power over
certain areas to Japan, was never signed
by China at all. But Japan, in signing
the treaty of 1915, "reserved the right"
to press for the acceptance of "group
five" at some future time. Japan has
now abandoned this right to press for
the acceptance of certain unfulfilled de
mands, but in view of the fact that she is
: already pledged to the Conference to
seek no more special privileges in China,
today's concession is not of such great
importance. Feeling against foreigners
is running high in China as a result of
the failure of the Conference to satisfy
Chinese desires. The anti-alien demon
strations have been directed against
Americans as well as Japanese, for it is
felt that America has betrayed the in
terests of China in sigiiing the four
power pact.
In Congress
The offer of Henry Ford to complete
and operate the nitrate plant at Mussel
Shoals was tranmitted to Congress with]
a non-committal note by Secretary
Weeks. Although he did not definitely
recommend the acceptance of the offer,
he suggested that the unemployment sit
uation be recognized as a factor in mak
ing the decision. Secretary Mellon ap
peared before the House Ways and
Means Committee, to urge that no pro
ceeds of foreign loans he used to finance
the soldier bonus, that no additional issue
of treasury certificates be made for that
purpose, and that no action be taken at
all upon the bonus at this time. .New in
ternal taxes would be necessary to meet
the cost of the bonus, he said, since the
present taxes are already abnormally
high for peace time.
The Italian Cabinet, headed by Bon
