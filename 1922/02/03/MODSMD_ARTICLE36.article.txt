# INDEPENDENTS PLAY ALUMNI THURSDAY
## 
### 
Tom Workman and his alumni base
ball squad will arrive from Los Ange
les next Thursday morning, February
9, and the game between the Cardinal
veterans and Cliff Ireland's team will
be played on the local lot in the al
ter noon. .
This game is to commemorate tbfe
fact that thirty years ago, on the ninth
day of February, Cliff first came to
the Stanford campus with a ball team.
Since that time he has made his an
nual invasion and the games have al
! ways been nip and tuc:k, the honors
shifting from one to the other.
In the evening, after the game, a
buffet supper will be served in Cliff's
honor, at the Beta Tlieta Pi house.
Besides the members of the alumni
| and Ireland's squad, the varsity base
-1 ball men on the campus, and the base
ball managers will be invited.
On Saturday, February 11, the alum
ni nine will meet the Stanford var
i sity on the local lot. With Johnny
Couch, Seal pitcher, recently sold to
[ the Cincinnati "Reds," on the mound
for them,and sufh men as Zeb Terry,
| Louis Cass, and Heinie Beeger, in the
i line-up, the veterans expect to bring
j Seay's men to time.
Coach Seay is getting his men in
shape, despite unfavorable weather
conditions and the chances for a strong
| varsity diamond squad this season are
! looking better all the time. Johnny
! Couch, who is. training the Car heav
j ers, reports that his prospects are
; showing better every clay and he feels
I confident of having a strong pitch
! ing staff to place at Seay's disposal
; when the season opens. Guy Draper,
j the only veteran on the string, is show
i ing real form and will be the maiu-
S stay of the staff. Kelly, Clark, Nef,
and Lowenstein are the other candi
dates who have received favorable
j comment from Couch. Besides these
there are several men who are out for
berths on the staff, including Bonner,
Howe, Chedister, Wright.
Berths on the Card infield this sea
son will be hotly contested for and
without exception it will be a case of
choosing a better man out of two very
I good ones. Around the initial sack,
Ratner and Patterson will lock horns
and it will be no easy job to pick be
tween them. "Pat" has a little the
edge on the work of . the position and
; Ratner oushines "Pat" a trifle with the
j stick.
Mitchell and Peavy are in line for
the keynote and here again it
will take some close figuring to de
| cide the issue. They are both good
; hitters and know how to handle the field
ing end of the jobâ€”a toss-up is the re
sult. For the shortstop position the
two most likely men are Maillot and
Woodward. Maillot is a veteran and
Woodward was one of the strongest
units of last year's freshman team.
"Lefty" Heckendorf seems to be the
one man who has a leadpipe cinch on
j his job. When any of the prospective
i candidates propose to step into his
i shoes they will have to spend most
of their time on the lot, Suhdays
I thrown in. This little third-sacker is
simply there with the goods. He
uses his head, as well as the mitt and
stick.
In addition to Captain /Green, there
; are several likely candidates for the
' receiving position. Holston, Wilcox,
| Holmes, Huneke, Fuller, and Ratner
| are all capable men with the big mitt
! and this end of the Card battery will
undoubtedly do most of the receiving.
At present Green is out with an in
jured knee, which will keep him out
of a uniform for a week or so longer.
For the outer gardens there are the
veterans Carver, Wayland, and Park
er. New men who look good are Hawk
ins, Oliva, Tritle, and Wideman.
