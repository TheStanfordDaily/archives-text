# LARGEST SCORE OF YEAR MADE IN PHI KAPPA PSI VICTORY
## 
### 
Phi Kappa Psi 1 >asket shooters ran
tip the highest score of the intramural
season last night by overwhelming the
Japanese Club quintet, 50-14. Sigma
Chi defeated Alpha Sigma Phi, 21-5.
Wittenberg, Phi Kappa Psi. dropped
the ball through the hoop from all
angles. His accuracy found the bask
et eleven times. Newlin, and Fish
helped out the scoring carnival con
siderably, accounting for the remain
ing points with field goals.
The fust teamplay of these three
men, combined with close guarding,
seemed to demoralize the Japanese,
who were unable at any time to check
the Phi Kappa Psi success.
Murata and Mizota made all points
for the Japanese five. It was evident
from the ineffectiveness of the losers'
forward combination that the loss of
Koba, the diminutive whirlwind, lias
taken the strength out of their team.
Sigma Chi had little trouble in win
ning from Alpha Sigma Phi. Parker
was the guiding light for the victors
in the matter of point scoring, mak
ing six baskets. Meeken played a
strong game at forward and completed
the total number of points. Welch,
and Moore were the most formidable
men on the Alpha Sigma Phi squad.
A'elcli threw all of the five points.
