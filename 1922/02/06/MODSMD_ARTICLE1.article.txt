### 
Scats for "Koo Koo Kubistown,"
Ram's Head play which will be pre
sented Friday evening in the Assembly
Hall, will go on sale tomorrow at 1
o'clock in the Administration Building
and at Crandall's in Palo Alto. The
prices will be $1.50 and $1.25, contrary
to previous announcement.
Two of the brightest, and paradox
ically the darkest, spots in the show
will be Nelson Valjean, '24, and Jor
dan Ownby, '22. These men furnish the
blackface comedy of the evening with
their impersonations of Humedor and
Taffeta, the negro couple. The fair
Taffeta is almost twice as large, up and
around, as her (his) mate. Ownby's
voice and Valjean's clever footwork are
said to add considerably to clever lines
and action.
"Cubist Blues," composed by Russ
Sewall, '21, is their song number.
The sets for the play have been com
pleted. Angles, brilliant colors, more
angles and more brilliant colors in
oddly beautiful combinations, will jump
out at the audience when the curtain
rises Friday evening. Soothing relief
will be furnished by the sombre purple,
black, and deep red of the murderer's
lair in which much of the action takes
place.
The twelve-piece orchestra, under the
direction of Myron Higby, '22, went
over the tunes which are always a vital
part of the Ram's Head shows yester
day morning. Their work is said to
have proved the society's promise that
the campus will hear something
uniquely attractive in the way of
music.
