# BABES SWAMP OAKLAND, 40-15
## Freshmen Court Squad Downs Oakland High School Five by Fast Playing, Saturday 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Oakland High School went down to
a 40-15 defeat before the faster and
heavier Babe basketball team in the
Pavilion Saturday night.

Assuming the lead in the first minute
of play, Duffy Seay's organization, by
close guarding and more accurate bas
ket shooting than has been exhibited so
far this season, ran up a score of 26-5
before half time.

The greater height and weight of the
Babe team gave them the advantage in
: this game, as it has in most of the
| games this year. Realizing their inability
j to score from positions near the basket,
I the High School forwards resorted to
J long shots from center floor, and most
j of their scoring was done, on these ran
dom distance shots.
For the first five minutes the game
! was fast, hut the small High School
I team soon tired of the pace set by the
Freshmen, and the remainder of the
half was devoted to close, guarding of
j the Freshmen forwards.
The second half was even slower than
! the first, with the High School coach
I using many substitute players to freshen
! his team.
Sibbett was the outstanding player of
[ the visiting team. He played the entire
| game., and was responsible for eleven of
j the fifteen points scored.
Coach Seav started his strongest com
bination against the Oakland team.
Hoffman and Alexander held down the
forward positions and ran up between
them a total of eighteen points the first
j half. This is the first game in which
I Hoffman has played for almost three,
j weeks, as a sprained knee has been
holding him on the bench.
Shipke and Oliva held down the run
ning and standing guard positions, and,
with the aid of Steele, fighting center of
the Babe team, smothered the attempts
of the High School forwards to score.
In the second half, Hoffman was re
placed by Hooper. While this is a cap
able, combination, Alexander and Hooper
failed to show the speed and teamwork
that Hoffman and Alexander had.
Hooper's best playing is done at run- j
ning guard position, which position he '
usually plays.
Alexander was the sensation of the
evening, scoring an even twenty points
during the game.
The lineup:
Stanford: Alexander and Hoffman,
forwards; Steele, center; Shipke and
Oliva, guards. Substitutions: Hooper
for Hoffman, Driscoll for Alexander,

Oakland High School went down to
a 40-15 defeat before the faster and
heavier Babe basketball team in the
Pavilion Saturday night.

Assuming the lead in the first minute
of play, Duffy Seay's organization, by
close guarding and more accurate bas
ket shooting than has been exhibited so
far this season, ran up a score of 26-5
before half time.

The greater height and weight of the
Babe team gave them the advantage in
: this game, as it has in most of the
| games this year. Realizing their inability
j to score from positions near the basket,
I the High School forwards resorted to
J long shots from center floor, and most
j of their scoring was done, on these ran
dom distance shots.
For the first five minutes the game
! was fast, hut the small High School
I team soon tired of the pace set by the
Freshmen, and the remainder of the
half was devoted to close, guarding of
j the Freshmen forwards.
The second half was even slower than
! the first, with the High School coach
I using many substitute players to freshen
! his team.
Sibbett was the outstanding player of
[ the visiting team. He played the entire
| game., and was responsible for eleven of
j the fifteen points scored.
Coach Seav started his strongest com
bination against the Oakland team.
Hoffman and Alexander held down the
forward positions and ran up between
them a total of eighteen points the first
j half. This is the first game in which
I Hoffman has played for almost three,
j weeks, as a sprained knee has been
holding him on the bench.
Shipke and Oliva held down the run
ning and standing guard positions, and,
with the aid of Steele, fighting center of
the Babe team, smothered the attempts
of the High School forwards to score.
In the second half, Hoffman was re
placed by Hooper. While this is a cap
able, combination, Alexander and Hooper
failed to show the speed and teamwork
that Hoffman and Alexander had.
Hooper's best playing is done at run- j
ning guard position, which position he '
usually plays.
Alexander was the sensation of the
evening, scoring an even twenty points
during the game.
The lineup:
Stanford: Alexander and Hoffman,
forwards; Steele, center; Shipke and
Oliva, guards. Substitutions: Hooper
for Hoffman, Driscoll for Alexander,
Houck for Oliva, Middleton for Steele.
Oakland High: Sibbett and Caldwell,
forwards; Coakley, center; Levit and
Hughes, guards. Substitutions: Ratco
vitch for Hughes, Parrett for Caldwell.
Connor for Ratcovitch, Brock for Lev
