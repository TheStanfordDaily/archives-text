# STANFORD TRACK IN STADIUM WILL BE STARTED SOON
## $14,000 is Estimated Cost of New Track Oval; "Dad" Moulton to Assist Builders 
### 
Stanford University i s beginning at
once on the construction of a quarter
mile cinder track within the new
stadium, which it is intended to make
one of the finest and fastest in the
country. The Board of Athletic Con
trol has instructed the firm of Baker
& Carpenter, supervising engineers of
the stadium, to complete plans and
specifications and to go ahead with the
work as soon as possible.
The estimated cost is $14,000. and,this
includes the track, drainage system, and
jumping pits.
The firm has been authorized to em
ploy E. \V. ("Dad") Moulton to aid
them in the building of the track.
Moulton was in charge of the building
of the track at the Panama-Pacific Ex
position, which was a notably fast
course, and is one of the most thor
oughly informed men in the the oun
try on the subject.
Cinders for the track will be brought
from the East, since hard coal cinders
are much better for the purpose'than the
soft coal cinders obtainable in the West.
An excavation to the depth of one
foot will be made on the oval and
straightaway. As the first layer to re
place the dirt removed, rice mats will
be laid around the. entire course. Cov
ering the rice mats, will be a layer of
clay and then on top of this the cinders.
Tile is to be laid around the inside of
the track oval, emptying into the sump
at the beginning of the straightaway.
Excavations at the ends of the field will
be filled with sawdust to provide pits for
the high and broad jumping.
This year's track meet with the Uni-
| versity of California will be held in
! Berkeley anil no attempt will be made
to have the Stanford track completed
before next year, which will give
i plenty of time for construction work to
, attain the best possible result.
1 he Board of Athletic Control have
also authorized Baker & Carpenter to
secure sketch plans for a clubhouse for
the accommodation of competing teams
in the stadium and for other permanent
improvements to the stadium for its
| beautitication and the convenience of
the crowds attending matches in the
enclosure.
They have also been requested to
secure tentative plans for a possible
platform with suitable architectural
architectural background that might be
placed in the field near the circular end
of the stadium for use for outdoor per
formances. Such a stage that could be
easily set up would be useful on many
occasions and the Board will take up
further consideration of the matter when
such suggestions as Baker & Carpenter
are able to gather are placed before it.

ering the rice mats, will be a layer of
clay and then on top of this the cinders.
Tile is to be laid around the inside of
the track oval, emptying into the sump
at the beginning of the straightaway.
Excavations at the ends of the field will
be filled with sawdust to provide pits for
the high and broad jumping.
This year's track meet with the Uni-
| versity of California will be held in
! Berkeley anil no attempt will be made
to have the Stanford track completed
before next year, which will give
i plenty of time for construction work to
, attain the best possible result.
1 he Board of Athletic Control have
also authorized Baker & Carpenter to
secure sketch plans for a clubhouse for
the accommodation of competing teams
in the stadium and for other permanent
improvements to the stadium for its
| beautitication and the convenience of
the crowds attending matches in the
enclosure.
They have also been requested to
secure tentative plans for a possible
platform with suitable architectural
architectural background that might be
placed in the field near the circular end
of the stadium for use for outdoor per
formances. Such a stage that could be
easily set up would be useful on many
occasions and the Board will take up
further consideration of the matter when
such suggestions as Baker & Carpenter
are able to gather are placed before it.
Stanford University i s beginning at
once on the construction of a quarter
mile cinder track within the new
stadium, which it is intended to make
one of the finest and fastest in the
country. The Board of Athletic Con
trol has instructed the firm of Baker
& Carpenter, supervising engineers of
the stadium, to complete plans and
specifications and to go ahead with the
work as soon as possible.
The estimated cost is $14,000. and,this
includes the track, drainage system, and
jumping pits.
The firm has been authorized to em
ploy E. \V. ("Dad") Moulton to aid
them in the building of the track.
Moulton was in charge of the building
of the track at the Panama-Pacific Ex
position, which was a notably fast
course, and is one of the most thor
oughly informed men in the the oun
try on the subject.
Cinders for the track will be brought
from the East, since hard coal cinders
are much better for the purpose'than the
soft coal cinders obtainable in the West.
An excavation to the depth of one
foot will be made on the oval and
straightaway. As the first layer to re
place the dirt removed, rice mats will
be laid around the. entire course. Cov
ering the rice mats, will be a layer of
clay and then on top of this the cinders.
