# "Ties That Bind"

### 
Sacrifices by the alunnii for their Alma Mater as
aimeans of keeping active their interest in Stanford
have been one of the talking points of the men in
charge of the Stanford endowment campaign. It
has been said that the man who gives to the Uni
versity feels that he owns a part of it. Whatever
his gift has done for the University is something for
which he feels himself solely responsible. The en
dowment officials contend with some confidence that
in canvassing the alumni for financial support, they
are at the same time building up solid, interested,
active backing for Stanford. And psychology de
crees that they are right.
But there is another, if not a broader way, to
build up and maintain the alumni interest and sup
port, a way that starts with the freshman and ends
with the oldest living alumnus; a way that is the most
natural and most appealing of them all. It is the
way of association and activity from the start of
every man's first year.
No man has taken the best out of college unless he
has formed lasting impressions and made lasting
friends; he has not known the real, or at least the
full value of college training, unless he has given
something of himself to the perpetuation of some
phase of college activity. There is nothing a college
man recalls in later years so readily as the things ac
complished bv his associates and himself. The semi
nars, the examinations, the classrooms, all the aca
demic life give way to the memories of activities or
accomplishments in college. The solving of a prob
lem, the fight for a certain right or the fight against
a certain wrong makes a lasting impression on a col
lege man's mind, lie will always associate his col
lege with that memory. His purely academic mem
ories soon become blurred and dim. His interests
J>ecome fewer and less active. Once out, there seems
no place to get into things again.

No man ever troubles himself to find out how
grades are running in a certain course, once he has
graduated. l ie soon forgets what grades he received,
and for that matter, forgets a great deal of what he
has learned in his courses. But if anyone has held
some recognized position in the student body as a
journalist, an athlete, a debater, or an organization
officer, he keeps alive somewhere in his memories
an interest that keeps him in touch with the "old
days." He wonders who fills that position now. He
wonders if the new occupant of that position is as
good as they were in " '09." He often takes the
trouble to drop down to the campus to look into such
matters and see how things are going. He has a tre
mendous advantage over the regular "stude." There
is something for him to do when he "comes back."
He once had, and still keeps, an active interest.
To build up interest is easy. Interest in many
things is merely temporary. That is the problem con
fronting the graduate as he takes his leave of college
life. Has he built up a permanent interest? He need
only look back over his four or five years. When
did he get into "things"? How many "things"?
How long did he stay in ? He is able to answer the
question himself, even before he leaves the Univer
sity.
Every man should start into some activity immedi
ately after his matriculation. His interest begins at
the start. As time goes on, he branches out into
more and greater activities. He solves problems,
fights battles, makes close friends, and at the same
time gets his education. He is equipped for the
finest kind of citizenship and is in possession of an
undying spirit of interest in his University.
Surely Stanford has and wants to have that kind
of men. It is up to the present college generation to

start the next one right. Stanford must get its
freshmen interested.

life. Has he built up a permanent interest? He need
only look back over his four or five years. When
did he get into "things"? How many "things"?
How long did he stay in ? He is able to answer the
question himself, even before he leaves the Univer
sity.
Every man should start into some activity immedi
ately after his matriculation. His interest begins at
the start. As time goes on, he branches out into
more and greater activities. He solves problems,
fights battles, makes close friends, and at the same
time gets his education. He is equipped for the
finest kind of citizenship and is in possession of an
undying spirit of interest in his University.
Surely Stanford has and wants to have that kind
of men. It is up to the present college generation to

start the next one right. Stanford must get its
freshmen interested.
Sacrifices by the alunnii for their Alma Mater as
aimeans of keeping active their interest in Stanford
have been one of the talking points of the men in
charge of the Stanford endowment campaign. It
has been said that the man who gives to the Uni
versity feels that he owns a part of it. Whatever
his gift has done for the University is something for
which he feels himself solely responsible. The en
dowment officials contend with some confidence that
in canvassing the alumni for financial support, they
are at the same time building up solid, interested,
active backing for Stanford. And psychology de
crees that they are right.
But there is another, if not a broader way, to
build up and maintain the alumni interest and sup
port, a way that starts with the freshman and ends
with the oldest living alumnus; a way that is the most
natural and most appealing of them all. It is the
way of association and activity from the start of
every man's first year.
No man has taken the best out of college unless he
has formed lasting impressions and made lasting
friends; he has not known the real, or at least the
full value of college training, unless he has given
something of himself to the perpetuation of some
phase of college activity. There is nothing a college
man recalls in later years so readily as the things ac
complished bv his associates and himself. The semi
nars, the examinations, the classrooms, all the aca
demic life give way to the memories of activities or
accomplishments in college. The solving of a prob
lem, the fight for a certain right or the fight against
a certain wrong makes a lasting impression on a col
lege man's mind, lie will always associate his col
lege with that memory. His purely academic mem
ories soon become blurred and dim. His interests
J>ecome fewer and less active. Once out, there seems
no place to get into things again.

No man ever troubles himself to find out how
grades are running in a certain course, once he has
graduated. l ie soon forgets what grades he received,
and for that matter, forgets a great deal of what he
has learned in his courses. But if anyone has held
some recognized position in the student body as a
journalist, an athlete, a debater, or an organization
officer, he keeps alive somewhere in his memories
an interest that keeps him in touch with the "old
days." He wonders who fills that position now. He
wonders if the new occupant of that position is as
good as they were in " '09." He often takes the
trouble to drop down to the campus to look into such
matters and see how things are going. He has a tre
mendous advantage over the regular "stude." There
is something for him to do when he "comes back."
He once had, and still keeps, an active interest.
To build up interest is easy. Interest in many
things is merely temporary. That is the problem con
fronting the graduate as he takes his leave of college
life. Has he built up a permanent interest? He need
only look back over his four or five years. When
