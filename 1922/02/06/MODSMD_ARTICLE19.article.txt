Four days of intensive campaigning have resulted
in a student subscription of approximately $105,000
to the First Million for Stanford fund. More than
one-half of the quota set by the Executive Committee
two weeks ago has been realized, while but sixty
six per cent of the student body has been solicited.
The success of the four-day intensive campaign in
dicates plainly that the quota can be raised and pos
sibly exceeded. The task that now confronts the ap
pointed workers is to interview every one of the
forty-five per cent of the students who have not yet
recorded their pledges. For this purpose a continua
tion committee will be appointed which will continue
the work toward the goal which has been set.
An effort will be made in some cases to secure an
increase in the amount of individual pledges, espe
cially in cases where the donor gave a check for a
stated amount because the five-year plan of payments
was not explained to him.
Students who live off the campus, in Palo Alto,
or other neighboring cities, and who are not readily
accessible to the solicitors will aid the campaign by
turning in their pledges to endowment headquarters
or to some member of the campaign committees.
