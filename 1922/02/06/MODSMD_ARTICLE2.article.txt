# STANFORD SOCCERITES TIE OLYMPIC CLUB, 1-1
## 
### 
Coacli Harry Maloney's soccer varsity
played in hard luck Saturday when the
Olympic Club eleven succeeded in tieing
the Cardinals, 1 to 1, in one of the
fastest games seen on the soccer turf
this season. This gives the Stanford
team a three point lead over the Olym
pics and practically cinches the cham
pionship of the University and Club
Soccer League.
The Cards were the favorites from
the start to the finish, although neither
team was able to score until the second
period, when George Clark, after a
passing rush, placed a hot one squarely
between the opponent's goal posts. Ten
minutes later, scarcely before the clos
ing gun, the Olympic kickers were
awarded a penalty kick which tied the
score and took away Stanford's hard
earned victory.
The varsity worked as a unit and
showed the be.st form of the season.
The backtield was a little hampered by
the loss of Captain Gorman, who was
out on account of a bad knee, and
an infected toe. Robinson, however,
made himself known to the Olympics
and capably filled the right half posi
tion.
The Stanford combination was as yet
sustained no defeats, and as . e games
that remain to be playe-d are compara
tively easy, it looks as thought the var
sity will come through the season with
out a single blot on its record.
