It is with regret that we notice an important rule
of Stanford etiquette is being broken at basketball
games. It was particularly noticeable Saturday
night, both during the preliminary game and the
main event. We refer to the practice of throwing
pennies on the floor for small boys to scramble
after.

There were some pennies thrown during the evening,
it is true, but there was nothing like the generosity dis
played last year upon similar occasions. What will
outsiders say when they see that no longer do the
small boys get a chance to earn an honest livelihood
by diving for Stanford pennies? Are we so self-centered
and so stingy that we cannot look beyond the selfish
worth of hoarding money, and see the greater benefit
accruing to the good name of the university if we would
only not be so tight? Where are the good old days?
It is well to say that most of the pennies have gone
to the Endowment Fund; but not all of them have
Next time you go to a basketball game, break off that
date you were going to keep the next night, and throw
a few pennies on the floor.
How do you suppose Jack Dempsey got his early
training? Scrambling for pennies, of course. Help train
our future athletes!

SPIRITUALISM MEETING AT STANFORD
BREAKS UP AS BOOZE IS UNCOVERED
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Stanford. Calif., Feb. 5.
(P. I. N. S.) —Held under the guise of a "spirit meet
ing," a wild bacchanalian orgy of professors was broken
up by the arrival of the student reserves this evening.
They found spirits, but not the occult kind. Investiga
tions will begin soon.

who learned a valuable household hint. Which is:

HOUSEHOLD HINT: Always make a new guest eat
the soup course out in the kitchen. Better be safe
than sorry. If he passes this preliminary test, it is
usually safe to ask him to the table for the rest of the
meal.

It is with regret that we notice an important rule
of Stanford etiquette is being broken at basketball
games. It was particularly noticeable Saturday
night, both during the preliminary game and the
main event. We refer to the practice of throwing
pennies on the floor for small boys to scramble
after.

There were some pennies thrown during the evening,
it is true, but there was nothing like the generosity dis
played last year upon similar occasions. What will
outsiders say when they see that no longer do the
small boys get a chance to earn an honest livelihood
by diving for Stanford pennies? Are we so self-centered
and so stingy that we cannot look beyond the selfish
worth of hoarding money, and see the greater benefit
accruing to the good name of the university if we would
only not be so tight? Where are the good old days?
It is well to say that most of the pennies have gone
to the Endowment Fund; but not all of them have
Next time you go to a basketball game, break off that
date you were going to keep the next night, and throw
a few pennies on the floor.
How do you suppose Jack Dempsey got his early
training? Scrambling for pennies, of course. Help train
our future athletes!
