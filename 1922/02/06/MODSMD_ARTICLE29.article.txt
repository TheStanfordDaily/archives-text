# MISS WALES TELLS Y .W. C .A. WORK OF STANFORD CLINICS
## 
### 
Miss Marguerite Wales, director of
i social work for the Stanford Clinics
; Auxiliary, spoke on "Medical Social
1 Work" at the Y. W. C. A. meeting
Thursday afternoon in the Women's
Clubhouse. "The aim of medical social
service is to prevent ill health, which is
the chief cause of social problems," Miss
Wales said in summing up her talk.
"Although medical social work is so
new that little has been planned toward
the study of it, Johns Hopkins and the
University of California are offering
two-year courses in preparation for med
ical social service. The first year is given
to theoretical study and the second to
practical held work. It is hoped that
such a course will be at Stanford; j
the practical experience would have to j
be obtained through working with the j
Associated Charities or similar organiza
tions in San Francisco.
"Efforts are being made to establish
nutrition classes in the Stanford Home
for Convalescent Children which will be j
under the care of women students of the
university who are interested in the
work. The Clinics have nutrition classes
every Saturday morning which are based
| on Dr. Emerson's principles in regard to
weight charts and weekly checking up
for results. The benefits are apparent
and both mothers and children are keen
| lv interested as the classes are conducted ;
j on a competitive basis."
I Miss Wales described the work of the
I visiting nurses connected with the Stan
j ford Clinics. Although nurse's training
is not necessary to a medical social
worker, Miss Wales believes that it is
the ideal background as it affords a bet
ter understanding of the problems which
will confront the worker.
Previous to her work at the Stiwiford
Clinics, Miss Wales was engaged in vari
ous types of social service work from
the time of her graduation from Vassar
until she became a nurse during the war.
She does not think it either wise or
profitable for women to enter social serv
ice immediately upon graduation from
college; at this time they have not yet
acquired a rational point of view in re
gard to social service work.
The greatest need of the Clinics, ac
cording to Miss Wales, is a convalescent
home for adults and occupational ther
apy, which she believes to be still "only a
dream of the future."
