# POPULAR EXHIBIT TO BE CONTINUED TWO WEEKS LONGER

i Much comment and interest has been
I aroused over the women's art exhibit at
[the Thomas Welton Stanford Memorial
| Art Gallery, which has been shown since
| the first of the year and which will be
continued two weeks longer. Its popu
• larity is further evidenced by the fact
' that these artists have been requested to
1 give an exhibit every year.
One painting, "The Marigolds," by
; Mary Hunter, has perhaps caused the
' most comment. Many have wanted to
I purchase it because of its richness of
i coloring and its natural simplicity. An
other work which has won praise from
artists especially is that of "The Adobe
i Walls" at Monterey.
Alice B. Chittenden has an unusual
group of three seaside pictures in whicli
she combines a happy medium of impres
sionistic art and a careful drawing from
I the old school. Miss Chittenden, who
I formerly confined her painting almost en
i tirely to flowers, has only recently
stepped into the field of producing lig
ures, in which she has achieved great
success. Her mastery of technique in the
impressionistic field of art is extremely
interesting.
Jessie Arms Botkc, who has recently
come from Holland, has three paintings
on exhibit which are fine from the stand
| point of color and design, and display the
I artist's remarkable power of imagina
j tion. They should be considered as
j poetic interpretations rather than repre-
J sentations. This quality of imagination
is marked in one of her pictures in which
she represents a setting of California
hills, while the buildings resemble a style
of Greek architecture.
The group of four portraits by Miss
S. D. Seymour show that she has the
happy faculty of putting life into her
subjects. This is perhaps best exempli
j fied in her wonderful characterization of
Otis Skinner.
