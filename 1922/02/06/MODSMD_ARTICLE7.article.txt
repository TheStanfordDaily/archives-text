# FIGHTING CARDINAL QUINTET LOSES TO BLUE AND GOLD IN LAST MINUTES OF CONTEST
## Weakened Varsity Squad Within Striking Distance During Most Of Contest; Score at Half, 8-5 
### GARRETT '23 
California, 24; Stanford, 14.
They say figures never lie. In this case they do. Ten points no more
indicates the difference between the California and Stanford fives in their
first game of the 1922 season, last Saturday night, than a foot expresses
the difference between thirty inches and a yard.
Five points would be more correct.
The unexpected happened—just as it has a habit of doing where teams
from Stanford and California are concerned.
The much-discussed glass backstops played their part, but not in the man
ner that had been anticipated. Records show that it was the Cardinal quin
tet, not the Blue and Gold, that suffered from the lesser resiliency of the new
backstops. California shots found the basket; tries from the hands of Stan
ford players bounced all around, but I he demonstrated the truth of that as-

rarely into the basket.
The biggest crowd that has ever
witnessed a basketball game here
saw a Cardinal quintet, weakened by
the loss of one regular and two sub
stitutes, make a heroic attempt to con
vert the "fighting chance," grudgingly
accorded them, into a victory.
For three quarters of the game the
Cardinals were within a striking dist
ance of the Bruins. Lack of capable
substitutes enabled the Bears to pile
up six points more and a safe, lead
near the end of the fray.

Bears Fail to Show Strength

Something was wrong with the ma
chine from across the bay, doped to
win by fifteen or twenty points.
Blue and Gold rooters blame it on
the spring floor of the new pavilion.
Stanford adherents declare that the
defensive playing of DeGroot and Jans
sen, and the sharp thrusts of McHose,
Pitts, and Davies at the California de
fense had something to do with the
result.
So take your choice.
Whichever it was there wasn't much
scoring in the first half, although the
crowd was kept in an uproar the whole
twenty minutes. California tallied
three field goals, two of them by Egg
leston. and two fouls, and Van Gent's
men made five points.

"Cripples" Disappear

For a man supposed to be weak from
the attack of the grippe and unable
to play, Larkey looked exceptionally
sound when he took his place at center
for California. A full-strength Cali
fornia quintet met a somewhat crip
pled Stanford team.
In previous games, fans declared,
Ray Pitts, that as a forward he was
a good running guard. Saturday night

sertion, for he proved that he was
"there" as a running guard. Pitts filled
Dick Richmond's place to the satis
faction of all concerned, until he had
to leave the game after a head-on
collision.

Janssen, Eggleston Share Honors

At the same time Pitts went out,
the best defensive player on either
team retired to the sidelines. That
vas Bob Janssen, Cardinal center,
who fought himself into the row of
Stanford court heroes by his seeming
ly impossible recoveries of the ball
from the Bruins.
It apparently was down in the al
manac that February 4 was one of
Art Eggleston's days to star. The
Bear skipper was in the right place
at the right time, threw three long
goals, and otherwise behaved himself
like the efficient running guard that
he is.
Davies and McHose gave away about
twenty pounds to their opponents and
then proceeded to play as good, if not
better, basketball than their rivals.
Subtract DeGroot, just up from the
sick bed, from the Stanford line-up,
and the Californians could have scored
almost at will.
Davies Scores Majority
Credit for ten of the fourteen points
for Stanford goes to Jimmy Davies.
The Cardinal leader coolly dropped
six out of eight free throws through
the basket. Talt, California forward,
did most of the work for his team,
where the actual scoring was concern
ed. Six of eight via the foul route
and three field goals, was his record.
Nip McHose made the other four
Cardinal points, throwing one field
goal after three minutes of play, and
another long shot just after the start
of the second half.
The Stanford substitutes came be
low the standard set by the regulars,
and the Bears pulled out in the lead
after they went in. "Lefty" Rogers
got into the game for a few minutes
but he did not get his bearings.
Stanford Forces Play
It was an astonished crowd that
saw the supposedly weak Stanford five
start with a rush and outplay the
Californians in the first ten minutes
of the game. Referee Kearns called
a foul on LeHane, and Davies placed
the ball through the ring for the first
score. Talt evened the count on a foul
on McHose. The latter a minute after,
rushed down the court and jumping
high above LeHane's head, threw a
basket. Kearns stopped the game and
cautioned the players and coaches
about remarks from the sidelines.
Davies converted a foul, putting
Stanford in the lead. 4 to 1. Eggleston
got under way with a long-range goal,
and a half minute later repeated. Dout
hit scored a field goal, and Davies
added another point. That ended the
scoring for the half, as neither team
could pierce the other's five-man de
fense. The score stood 8 to 5.
More Scores in Last Half
After the intermission, the play
started slowly enough with the Car
dinal's playing on a par with their op
ponents. Talt scored on a foul, and
McHose found the basket with a long
one. Then Talt broke loose, making
two field goals from directly in front
of the Stanford basket. The score
was »pw 13 to 7, with thirteen minutes
to go. Davies broke through with a
sensational one-handed overhand shot,
but Eggleston nullified his efforts with
a long throw, bringing the count to
15 to 9. Rogers went in for McHose,
Piggott for Janssen, and Campbell for
Pitts. Coop replaced Douthit.
When play resumed Davies convert
ed a foul, and a minute later repeated.
With the score 15 to 11, a field goal
by Coop and two fouls by Talt placed
California eight points ahead, 19 to 11.
Davies tallied the final Cardinal point
on a foul, but Larkey and Talt threw
in five more points. Janssen and Mc-
Hose went back into the game near
the close.
