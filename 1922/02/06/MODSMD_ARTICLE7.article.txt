# FIGHTING CARDINAL QUINTET LOSES TO BLUE AND GOLD IN LAST MINUTES OF CONTEST
## Weakened Varsity Squad Within Striking Distance During Most Of Contest; Score at Half, 8-5 
### GARRETT '23 
California, 24; Stanford, 14.
They say figures never lie. In this case they do. Ten points no more
indicates the difference between the California and Stanford fives in their
first game of the 1922 season, last Saturday night, than a foot expresses
the difference between thirty inches and a yard.
Five points would be more correct.
The unexpected happenedâ€”just as it has a habit of doing where teams
from Stanford and California are concerned.
The much-discussed glass backstops played their part, but not in the man
ner that had been anticipated. Records show that it was the Cardinal quin
tet, not the Blue and Gold, that suffered from the lesser resiliency of the new
backstops. California shots found the basket; tries from the hands of Stan
ford players bounced all around, but I he demonstrated the truth of that as-

rarely into the basket.
The biggest crowd that has ever
witnessed a basketball game here
saw a Cardinal quintet, weakened by
the loss of one regular and two sub
stitutes, make a heroic attempt to con
vert the "fighting chance," grudgingly
accorded them, into a victory.
For three quarters of the game the
Cardinals were within a striking dist
ance of the Bruins. Lack of capable
substitutes enabled the Bears to pile
up six points more and a safe, lead
near the end of the fray.

Bears Fail to Show Strength

Something was wrong with the ma
chine from across the bay, doped to
win by fifteen or twenty points.
Blue and Gold rooters blame it on
the spring floor of the new pavilion.
Stanford adherents declare that the
defensive playing of DeGroot and Jans
sen, and the sharp thrusts of McHose,
Pitts, and Davies at the California de
fense had something to do with the
result.
So take your choice.
Whichever it was there wasn't much
scoring in the first half, although the
crowd was kept in an uproar the whole
twenty minutes. California tallied
three field goals, two of them by Egg
leston. and two fouls, and Van Gent's
men made five points.

"Cripples" Disappear

For a man supposed to be weak from
the attack of the grippe and unable
to play, Larkey looked exceptionally
sound when he took his place at center
for California. A full-strength Cali
fornia quintet met a somewhat crip
pled Stanford team.
In previous games, fans declared,
Ray Pitts, that as a forward he was
a good running guard. Saturday night

sertion, for he proved that he was
"there" as a running guard. Pitts filled
Dick Richmond's place to the satis
faction of all concerned, until he had
to leave the game after a head-on
collision.

Janssen, Eggleston Share Honors

At the same time Pitts went out,
the best defensive player on either
team retired to the sidelines. That
vas Bob Janssen, Cardinal center,
who fought himself into the row of
Stanford court heroes by his seeming
ly impossible recoveries of the ball
