# RECORD CROWD SEES CALIFORNIA VICTORY AFTER HARD FIGHT
## 
### Bertha Vaughan, '22 
California's 24 to 14 victory over the
Cardinal live Saturday night was not
an easy one. The score of Bto 5 which
marked the ending of the first half of
the playing speaks more clearly of the.
intenseness of the game up to the last
minutes, when a few breaks gave the
Blue and Gold men a chance to run up
the score.
More than tilled to its 3,700 capacity,
the new pavilion held the biggest crowd
that has ever witnessed an intercolle
giate basketball game on the campus.
Everj* seat was occupied and men and
women dotted all the available floor
space back of the court lines and the
few convenient ledges adjoining the
balconies. Small peanut and sandwich
vendors moved among the crowd and
mingled their shrill cries with the
deeper notes of the rooters. Most of
the audience arrived early enough to see
the Freshman victory and all but a few
last stragglers were in place to cheer
when the two varsities trotted out on
the floor.
Already hailed as victors, confident, a
little superior, came the Blue and Gold
men, to circle before their goal for the
warming up practice. At the other end
of the. court, facing odds again, as in
the Big Game of the football season,
and handicapped by the loss of one of
two veteran players, yet steady aim
determined to fight, paced the Cardinal
squad.
The whistle blew and from the mo
ment the ball left the hands of the
referee to become the object for the
attack of the two centers, California
knew she had more to think about dur
ing the forty minutes of the game than
the glass-backed goal posts. It was de
fensive playing on both sides from the
very start. Both teams went wild in
the first few minutes. Almost certain
California shots missed the basket and
the ball was carried to the Cardinal goal
only to meet a similar fate, poising on
the hoop time after time to fall away
from and not into the basket. The first
score made by Stanford broke the spell
and the game began.
At the end of the first half 110
changes had been made in the lineup.
Janssen stayed throughout the twenty 1
minutes, playing his best game of the.
season. The lanky center seemed to be
all over the court at once and always
in the position in which he was needed.
Pitts, substituting for Richmond, played
a steady, hard game, with no apparent
nervousness in the responsibility he was
carrying. Captain Da vies looked weak
and not at all a match for the Cali
fornia guard, but he played like a Hash
and, with Mcl Jose, continually outwit
ted his opponents. Big DeGroot, a little
pale from his recent illness, was the
bulwark of the team's strength. 11 is
towering figure again and again re
claimed the ball from the enemy quar
ters and regularly, like a huge mastiff,
he shook off the Blue and Gold men
who attempted to hinder him.
Substitutions in the last half, espe
cially toward the end of the game,
weakened the varsity and a few breaks,
in which the shots of Eggleston went
home, gave California the ten-point vic
tory.
The singing of the college hymns
drew the curtain 011 a game worth see
ing. California left the campus with
pride in her victory, while Stanford
reviews a game well played and plans
for the morrow.

the glass-backed goal posts. It was de
fensive playing on both sides from the
very start. Both teams went wild in
the first few minutes. Almost certain
California shots missed the basket and
the ball was carried to the Cardinal goal
only to meet a similar fate, poising on
the hoop time after time to fall away
from and not into the basket. The first
score made by Stanford broke the spell
and the game began.
At the end of the first half 110
changes had been made in the lineup.
Janssen stayed throughout the twenty 1
minutes, playing his best game of the.
season. The lanky center seemed to be
all over the court at once and always
in the position in which he was needed.
Pitts, substituting for Richmond, played
a steady, hard game, with no apparent
nervousness in the responsibility he was
carrying. Captain Da vies looked weak
and not at all a match for the Cali
fornia guard, but he played like a Hash
and, with Mcl Jose, continually outwit
ted his opponents. Big DeGroot, a little
pale from his recent illness, was the
bulwark of the team's strength. 11 is
towering figure again and again re
claimed the ball from the enemy quar
ters and regularly, like a huge mastiff,
he shook off the Blue and Gold men
who attempted to hinder him.
Substitutions in the last half, espe
cially toward the end of the game,
weakened the varsity and a few breaks,
in which the shots of Eggleston went
home, gave California the ten-point vic
tory.
The singing of the college hymns
drew the curtain 011 a game worth see
ing. California left the campus with
pride in her victory, while Stanford
reviews a game well played and plans
for the morrow.
California's 24 to 14 victory over the
Cardinal live Saturday night was not
an easy one. The score of Bto 5 which
marked the ending of the first half of
the playing speaks more clearly of the.
intenseness of the game up to the last
minutes, when a few breaks gave the
Blue and Gold men a chance to run up
the score.
More than tilled to its 3,700 capacity,
the new pavilion held the biggest crowd
that has ever witnessed an intercolle
giate basketball game on the campus.
Everj* seat was occupied and men and
women dotted all the available floor
space back of the court lines and the
few convenient ledges adjoining the
balconies. Small peanut and sandwich
vendors moved among the crowd and
mingled their shrill cries with the
deeper notes of the rooters. Most of
the audience arrived early enough to see
the Freshman victory and all but a few
last stragglers were in place to cheer
when the two varsities trotted out on
the floor.
Already hailed as victors, confident, a
little superior, came the Blue and Gold
men, to circle before their goal for the
warming up practice. At the other end
of the. court, facing odds again, as in
the Big Game of the football season,
and handicapped by the loss of one of
two veteran players, yet steady aim
determined to fight, paced the Cardinal
squad.
The whistle blew and from the mo
ment the ball left the hands of the
referee to become the object for the
attack of the two centers, California
knew she had more to think about dur
ing the forty minutes of the game than
the glass-backed goal posts. It was de
fensive playing on both sides from the
very start. Both teams went wild in
the first few minutes. Almost certain
