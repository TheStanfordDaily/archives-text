# BARITONE TO BE LAST ARTIST OF CONCERT SERIES
## Reinald Werrenrath Receives Favorable Criticism From Booking Music Authorities 
### 
Reinald Werrenrath, baritone solois^,
who comes to the Assembly Hall on
Thursday evening under the auspices of
the Peninsula Association, is conceded
by critics both here and abroad to be
among the foremost artists of the mu
sical world. Although he has not ap
peared at Stanford before, he will not
be. unfamiliar to many, as he has visited
the coast several times, appearing at San
Francisco and Berkeley.
Concerning Werrenrath's standing in
his chosen art, there seems to he no
question whatever. For several years
past, his recitals in News York, Boston,
Chicago, Philadelphia, and others of the
largest cities have been counted among
the most important features of the sea
son, and now this has also become true
of London, where two seasons have es
tablished him as firmly as in any city of
his native country. Following the bari
tone's first recital i,n London in June,
1920, the "Daily Telegraph" had this to
say in summing up the salient qualities
of Werrenrath's art:
"Granting that he has a voice of un
usual beauty, and admirably trained, he
still would not have reached the point
where he finds himself today if he
could not have given the public some
thing more than merely a fine voice.
All critics agree that clearness of dic
tion is a prime necessity with singers
and also agree that surprisingly few
singers have it. Werrenrath is most
unusual in this respect. His Fnglish is
singularly pure and clear, altogether
free of the carelessness so character
istic of American singers. Every word
that he sings carries its full value, and
it is a liberal education for a young
singer to listen to this artist and observe
the ease with which he interprets a song.
This characteristic is not confined to his
songs in English by any means. He is
a gifted linguist, and his French, Ger
man, and Italian arc flawless.
"As to phrasing, that is musicianship,
the result of study. Too many singers
know only singing, can play no instru
ment, have no knowledge of harmony
or theory, and have no interest in music
outside of that which is sung.
