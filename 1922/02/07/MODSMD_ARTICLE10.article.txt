# STUDENT BODY WILL CHOOSE OFFICERS AT MID-YEAR ELECTION
## 
### 
Midyear election of class and student
body officers will lie held on the Quad
tomorrow. Up to the present time, lit
tle interest has been shown in the elec
tion. and few nominations have been
handed in to the election board. For
this reason, A. A. Carrey, '22, chairman
of the Election Board, has announced
that there will be spaces on the ballot
where names may be, written in.
Three members of the Men's Council,
two Junior members on the Executive
Committee, and one Sophomore repre
sentative to the Executive Board are. to
be elected in addition to the class of
ficers.
The same lack of interest and lack of
competition for the various offices which
has characterized the former elections
is evident. The polls will be open from
11 a. m. until 2 p. m. and A. A. Carrey
has asked that the student body as a
whole shall go to the polls and vote,
in order that the results may be repre
sentative of the will of the students.
Chairman A. A. Carrey's statement
follows:
"Owing to the fact that there
have been few nominations filed,
and in order that we may have
more interest in the election tomor
row, the Election Board has pro
vided for a number of blanks on
the ballot. Students are urged to
write in the names of their choices
for the various offices if they do not
already appear on the ballot. I
sincerely hope that the students will
show more interest in the election
tomorrow than they have shown in
those of the past.
"A. A. CARREY,
"Chairman Election Board."
