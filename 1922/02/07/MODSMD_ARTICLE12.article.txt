### 
A setting sun will be the setting for I
the sitting of the charming Debelia for
her portrait in "Koo Ivoo Kubistown." j
Clyde Coakley has put together on
canvas a combination of castle towers, j
red sun and golden rays, cliffs, trees, i
flowers, and sky that is so unreal that
it is realistic. In that set also is a
flight of stairs that do not stop at
going up, they go around, over, and
out."

The clink of feminine heels and ;
mincing steps. Twinkling ankles. Last
night for the first time the ladies of
the chorus tried on their high-heeled !
shoes.
* * *
Hands! —If ever there was use made ■
of hands, it will be done Friday even-!
ing. Graceful, lady-like manipulations
are being cultivated with success by
practically the entire female cast, i

Several of the women in the play
broke down last night when Sam Men

"Honeysuckle Home," by Myron
Higby, will be sung in the first act by
by a quartet composed of Jerry Pow

ell, Bing Shaw, Reed Nesbit and How
ard Wilson. Clever steps by the chorus
are worked into this number.

The entr'acte will drip with warm
b-l-l-ood. Its characters are the heart
less assassins, assisted by Sam Men
denhall.
The authors of the show were pres
ent in a body at last night's rehear
sals. Certain sections of the play that
bore the flavor of Chaparral editori
als were applauded vociferously by one
Thomas Carskadon, '22.
From the spectacular rise of the
curtain on the opening chorus number
to the more spectacular fall on the
finale, "Koo Koo Kubistown" will be
put together tonight. Les Seib has
warned the cast that rehearsals will
continue into the daylight hours if
necessary. Dress rehearsal will be
Wednesday evening.
Not even the most dilapidated furni
ture in the Assembly Hall property
room will be used Friday night. Tables,
chairs and other properties are all
being constructed by the cubistic
crazed carpenters.
