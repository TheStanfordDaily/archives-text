# CARDINAL AND COUGAR QUINTETS TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES ON PAVILION COURT TONIGHT
## NORTHERN FIVE CLAIMED SECOND ONLY TO U. OF W. 
### 
With nothing critical at stake in the
Pacific Coast Conference, Van Gent's
basketball varsity will open up against
the Washington State live tonight 011
the pavilion court.
The Cougars have something of a
grievance. They can't quite forget one
evening in Pullman last year when a
Stanford team, twenty-three points to
the bad in the second half of the game
with W. S. C., tied the score with a
cyclonic finish and then won the contest
after two extra periods of play.
So the Washington State players have
come south with ideas of retaliation
fixed uppermost in their minds.
Fred Bolder, "wise man" of coast bas
ketball, and his troupe arrived for their

two-night stand yesterday afternoon,,
and lost 110 time in working out 011 the
pavilion court. Xot satisfied witli a
short practice in the afternoon, the Pull
man squad donned their togs again last
evening and today.
In between the visitors' workouts yes
terday, tin 1 Stanford varsity squad did
a little preparation 011 its own account.
Van Gent was all smiles, and the pre
occupied air which lias hung over him
of late had disappeared.
The reason was soon apparent. For
the first time since the start of the
season, all his regulars were, back in
the fold. Rogers was hustling around
at top speed, and Arlderson and Cleave
land showed no effects of their recent
illness. To complete the array, Rich
mond walked 011 the floor ready to take
up the. business of basketball once more.
He is still quite weak, and it is ex
tremely doubtful whether he will be in
shape for the Washington State series.
The quirks of the schedule have put
the W. S. C. five in next-to-last place in
the percentage column. The Staters
have had their fill of the leading Wash
ington "Huskies," as they are now
known, for the Seattle crew took them
down Dead Man's Row no less than
four distinct times. The last time W.
S. C. went through the mill was last
Thursday and Friday, when they lost,
38-27 and 40-10, on their home court.
Although they don't say as much,
Bohler's men expect to climb a few
rungs on the conference ladder at the
expense of the Cardinal squad. They
base most of their hopes on the 26-24
defeat inflicted on the California live
on the latter's recent tour of the north
land. The Cougars have a whirlwind
finish in reserve. The short end of a
21-10 score at the end of the first half
in the U. C. game did not phase them.
They came back and held the Bears to
a line field goal while they massed
enough points for a win.
Fried, the Cougar leader, is the
"handle-with-care" man of the. visitors.
He takes on himself the task of making
most of the points for his team.
The Stanford lineup for tonight is
uncertain. Van Gent is confronted with
the unusual situation of having too
many good men to choose from. Pitts
showed his ability as a running guard
in the California game and it is hard
to keep him out of the regular lineup.
Anderson seems to have improved dur
ing his few days' rest. DeGroot is
practically sure to start at standing
guard, and Janssen has the call at cen
ter. Davies and McHose are favored
for the forward positions, but Rogers
is rapidly rounding into last year's form
and will probably take Mc Hose's place
sooner or later in the fray.
The contest, which is the second con
ference game at Stanford, will he called,
at 8:15. Admission will he fifty cents
to holders of student body cards and
seventy-five cents to others.
How the teams will probably line up:
Stanford Position Wash. State
Davies (C.) Forward Fried (C.)
McHose, Rogers..Forward Savers
Janssen Center Sorenssen
Anderson, Pitts ....Guard Loomis
DeGroot Guard Herrington

With nothing critical at stake in the
Pacific Coast Conference, Van Gent's
basketball varsity will open up against
the Washington State live tonight 011
the pavilion court.
The Cougars have something of a
grievance. They can't quite forget one
evening in Pullman last year when a
Stanford team, twenty-three points to
the bad in the second half of the game
with W. S. C., tied the score with a
cyclonic finish and then won the contest
after two extra periods of play.
So the Washington State players have
come south with ideas of retaliation
fixed uppermost in their minds.
Fred Bolder, "wise man" of coast bas
ketball, and his troupe arrived for their

two-night stand yesterday afternoon,,
and lost 110 time in working out 011 the
pavilion court. Xot satisfied witli a
short practice in the afternoon, the Pull
man squad donned their togs again last
evening and today.
In between the visitors' workouts yes
terday, tin 1 Stanford varsity squad did
a little preparation 011 its own account.
Van Gent was all smiles, and the pre
occupied air which lias hung over him
of late had disappeared.
The reason was soon apparent. For
the first time since the start of the
season, all his regulars were, back in
the fold. Rogers was hustling around
at top speed, and Arlderson and Cleave
land showed no effects of their recent
illness. To complete the array, Rich
mond walked 011 the floor ready to take
up the. business of basketball once more.
He is still quite weak, and it is ex
tremely doubtful whether he will be in
shape for the Washington State series.
The quirks of the schedule have put
the W. S. C. five in next-to-last place in
the percentage column. The Staters
have had their fill of the leading Wash
ington "Huskies," as they are now
known, for the Seattle crew took them
down Dead Man's Row no less than
four distinct times. The last time W.
S. C. went through the mill was last
Thursday and Friday, when they lost,
38-27 and 40-10, on their home court.
Although they don't say as much,
Bohler's men expect to climb a few
rungs on the conference ladder at the
expense of the Cardinal squad. They
base most of their hopes on the 26-24
defeat inflicted on the California live
on the latter's recent tour of the north
land. The Cougars have a whirlwind
finish in reserve. The short end of a
21-10 score at the end of the first half
in the U. C. game did not phase them.
They came back and held the Bears to
a line field goal while they massed
enough points for a win.
Fried, the Cougar leader, is the
"handle-with-care" man of the. visitors.
He takes on himself the task of making
most of the points for his team.
The Stanford lineup for tonight is
uncertain. Van Gent is confronted with
the unusual situation of having too
many good men to choose from. Pitts
showed his ability as a running guard
in the California game and it is hard
to keep him out of the regular lineup.
Anderson seems to have improved dur
ing his few days' rest. DeGroot is
practically sure to start at standing
guard, and Janssen has the call at cen
ter. Davies and McHose are favored
for the forward positions, but Rogers
is rapidly rounding into last year's form
and will probably take Mc Hose's place
sooner or later in the fray.
The contest, which is the second con
ference game at Stanford, will he called,
