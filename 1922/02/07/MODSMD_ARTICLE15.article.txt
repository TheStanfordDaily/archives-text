# EL TORO CAGE TEAM WINS FROM SEQUOIA BY NARROW MARGIN
## 
### 
El Toro basketers won a close game
from Sequoia 2, 19-14, and Alpha Tau
Omega swamped the Kappa Alpha
quintet, 21-2, in last ngiht's intramural
bouts.
The first half of the El Toro-Sequoia
contest was a draw, 6 to fi. Sequoia
had superior teamwork, but was un
able to penetrate their opponents' de
fense. The Sequoia forwards were
forced to heave long shots, which
bounced all around the hoop but not
inside.
In the second half, the score was
tied at 12 to 12. El Toro took the
lead and retained it for the remainder
of the game. Big Ludeke, playing
center on the El Toro five, was a win
ning factor in more ways than one.
Ludeke played in the clouds and re
ceived passes, and tossed for baskets
immune from the bothersome work of
customary guards. He made two of
the baskets himself, but his best func
tion was putting the ball in the hands
of his better shooting . team-mates,
Bob and Harold Wright, who account
ed for five and two field goals respec
tively. Evans and Brown were the
star men of the Sequoia team.
Alpha Tau Omega carried the ball
down the floor at will, the Kappa
Alpha defense being rather weak.
However, the A. T. O. five worked to
gether and passed and dribbled with
considerable ability. Neill played a
fast and accurate forward for the vic
tors, tossing the. ball through the net
six times. A large number of short
shots at the basket were responsible
for many of the points made by the
winners. The A. T. O. team hwt lost
no games so far, and is slated to make
a strong bid for the first honors of
league three.
