# Third-Quarter Bidding
## 
### 
Progress is not made through clinging to old forms
when these have been found inadequate, but by
searching for new solutions, the value of which can
not be proved by discussion as to relative potential
merits and demerits, but only by actual trial.
Speculation as to a possible settlement of the diffi
culties of the present women's rushing system won't
get us anywhere to speak of—-the only way to deter
mine the best rushing arrangement is by experiment.
It is the business of Panhellenic to meet through
out the year to discuss regulations for each succes
sive rushing season. So far we have had approxi
mately the same system each year, with a few changes
as to length of the season, limitation of expense, com
munication and other minor restrictions. It is obvi
ous that the present rushing agreement between
women's organizations is not satisfactory in anv re
spect, but they have hesitated to try a new system
because the change to such an arrangement as third
quarter bidding is such a direct one that it is impos
sible to foresee the exact details of its working out.
Serious defects are apparent in the present ar
rangement, the outstanding one of which is that with
the short and intensive period of rushing at the be
ginning of each quarter it is all the harder for enter
ing women to adjust themselves to entirely new con
ditions. They do not get the essential "good start"
in academic matters, and the same is true in regard to
the sororities themselves. The system as we now
have it entails needless time, energy, and expense.
Moreover, all freshman women arc required to live
in Roble their first year, to promote greater acquaint
anceship, and with their axiliation at the end of two
weeks they are given a double set of responsibilities,
to house and to dormitory, which contradicts the
spirit of the dormitory rule. They should be given
a chance to learn to become Stanford women in order
to become better fraternity women.
Since a freshman can not live with her organization
for a year, it would solve many difficulties to have
her remain unaffiliated and free until the end of her
tirst formulative year, during which both the fresh
man and the organizations could see each other in the
light of common day, and the new student would
have time to make her decision calmly and uninflu
enced. This would do away with the hysteria of de
ciding in haste, and the entering woman would be able
to gain a better perspective and conception of the
new conditions and relations of University life.
Restrictions as to the number of dates and other par
ticulars of informal rushing could be matters worked
out in the rushing contract.
Certainly the system has been adopted at other uni
versities and by certain of the men's organizations
here, and since Panhellenic should stand for progres
sive ideas and devlopment, the women,s organiza
tions on tlw campus would do well in working through
Panhellenic in breaking away from old forms and
trying a new system. Now is the time to decide to
take this new step, which certainly is not a retro
gressive one, in order to afford Panhellenic time dur
ing the rest of the year to develop details in the ad
justment. The idea is worth a trial by organizations
which, should be believers in reform and progress,
and the women's fraternities have an opportunity to
be leaders in this field. M. J. C.

Panhellenic in breaking away from old forms and
trying a new system. Now is the time to decide to
take this new step, which certainly is not a retro
gressive one, in order to afford Panhellenic time dur
ing the rest of the year to develop details in the ad
justment. The idea is worth a trial by organizations
which, should be believers in reform and progress,
and the women's fraternities have an opportunity to
be leaders in this field. M. J. C.
Progress is not made through clinging to old forms
when these have been found inadequate, but by
searching for new solutions, the value of which can
not be proved by discussion as to relative potential
merits and demerits, but only by actual trial.
Speculation as to a possible settlement of the diffi
culties of the present women's rushing system won't
get us anywhere to speak of—-the only way to deter
mine the best rushing arrangement is by experiment.
It is the business of Panhellenic to meet through
out the year to discuss regulations for each succes
sive rushing season. So far we have had approxi
mately the same system each year, with a few changes
as to length of the season, limitation of expense, com
munication and other minor restrictions. It is obvi
ous that the present rushing agreement between
women's organizations is not satisfactory in anv re
spect, but they have hesitated to try a new system
because the change to such an arrangement as third
quarter bidding is such a direct one that it is impos
sible to foresee the exact details of its working out.
Serious defects are apparent in the present ar
rangement, the outstanding one of which is that with
the short and intensive period of rushing at the be
ginning of each quarter it is all the harder for enter
ing women to adjust themselves to entirely new con
ditions. They do not get the essential "good start"
in academic matters, and the same is true in regard to
the sororities themselves. The system as we now
have it entails needless time, energy, and expense.
Moreover, all freshman women arc required to live
in Roble their first year, to promote greater acquaint
anceship, and with their axiliation at the end of two
weeks they are given a double set of responsibilities,
to house and to dormitory, which contradicts the
spirit of the dormitory rule. They should be given
a chance to learn to become Stanford women in order
to become better fraternity women.
Since a freshman can not live with her organization
for a year, it would solve many difficulties to have
her remain unaffiliated and free until the end of her
tirst formulative year, during which both the fresh
man and the organizations could see each other in the
light of common day, and the new student would
have time to make her decision calmly and uninflu
enced. This would do away with the hysteria of de
ciding in haste, and the entering woman would be able
to gain a better perspective and conception of the
new conditions and relations of University life.
Restrictions as to the number of dates and other par
ticulars of informal rushing could be matters worked
out in the rushing contract.
Certainly the system has been adopted at other uni
versities and by certain of the men's organizations
here, and since Panhellenic should stand for progres
sive ideas and devlopment, the women,s organiza
tions on tlw campus would do well in working through
Panhellenic in breaking away from old forms and
trying a new system. Now is the time to decide to
