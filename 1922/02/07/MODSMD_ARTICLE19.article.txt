# Visitors
## 
### 
Stanford is entertaining visitors tonight and to
morrow night. They are the Washington State C'ol
lege basketball players and their coach, J. Fred
Holder. During both days the visitors will be treated
as visitors to Stanford always are and open house is
declared for them. Hut, from eight to nine o'clock

each evening no such treatment is guaranteed them.
Stanford has an unruly basketball team that is
determined to humble its visitors; the Cougars have
come here to defeat the Stanford five. While the
two teams are on the court the roles of host and
guests are dropped and the men become competitive
enemies.
Washington State, despite its conference record
of one victory and live defeats, has a strong team.
Stanford has a fighting aggregation that does not
know when to quit. The winner of tonight's contest
can be named only after the final gun is fired.
The bleachers will be filled with interested Stan
ford students while the Stanford basketball squad
entertains its visitors.
