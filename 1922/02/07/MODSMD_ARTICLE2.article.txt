### 
Thcta Chi took a 27-12 basketball vic
tor}- from Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and
Sigma Nu won from El Capitan, 16-9,
in yesterday's court contests.
The first half of the game between
Theta Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
was an even toss-up. The former ag
gregation started out early witli a 7-1
lead, but the S. A. E. players pulled up
and shortened this advantage to 9 8 at
the end of the period.
For the first five minutes of the sec
ond half there was no scoring. Then
the Theta Chi machine slipped into high
gear, and points began to roll up. Six
field goals in rapid succession definitely
put the game on ice. There were many
long shots at the goal.- These were
made especially by the S. A. E. for
wards, who were unable to carry the
ball down the court to within a good
throwing distance of the basket. At the
same time the Theta Chi men were
consistently shooting for the hoop.
Smith, of the winners, was high point
getter with five field goals, while his
partner, Fleming, scored only one less.
Dalton showed up well at standing
guard. Mathew and Lewis divided scor
ing honors for Alpha Epsilon.
Sigma Nu and El Capitan staged a
first - class rough - and - tumble contest.
Douglas, Sigma Nu center, was a good
man to get possession of the ball, while
l'ragg and Thedc put the casaba
through the hoop three, times each.
Echren played a hard game at center
for El Capitan. and, besides being in
most of the court battles, he was re
sponsible for a majority of the points
made. Stern, running guard, made the
res! of the baskets.
