# A
						Competent Official
## 
### 
The way of an athletic official is hard. Not every
one is entirely satisfied with every decision made by
him. Not every one participating or attending ath
letic contests is polite enough to refrain from shout
ing his disfavor. Therefore the work of an official
is not only hard but practically thankless.
Referees come and referees go, but Referee Bud
Kearns goes on forever. He goes on in the same
competent way and is always the same fair and effi
cient master of the game. His off-nights are the
ones when no basketball games are played. He is
consistently accurate in his decisions, and is one of the
fairest and most competent basketball officials in
the coast court game today. Let us have more of
Kearns.
