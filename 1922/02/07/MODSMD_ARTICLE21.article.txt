It ain't right, guys!
This life is turned about.
It is my lot
To be a Cabbage sprout.
And oft I sit
Before once flying keys
Till early morn,
, And still the darned hunch flees.
But here in class
Where vital dope is spread
I find the squib
Buzzing about my head.
What's there to do
But knock it to the floor
And rope it up?
But then the lecture's o'er!
y
To write, and then to sleep.
To flunk? —You sure are right.
Oh Justice, give a peep
For lecturing at night.
The dope, I say,
Grows but by day
Now say, guys, is it right?
—A. Lass.

Classified Ads calls our attention to the fact that the
new fire truck may be called out any night for its first
workout on the gentle peruser's abode, and it would
be well to pay some of the back insurance premiums.
Not to be outdone, we point with temerity to the en
suing mid-quarters. Take but your leaves early.
# * ♦
Since there is a great risk that the press may sluff
off some day, due to the wear and tear of the hot stuff
contained in these columns, we advise a policy of pro
tectionism. It is well to look to the future. There may
bg a time when you will de distressed for the lack of
a leaf or two of Cabbages. Save your papers. You'll
enjoy them equally as much the second or third time as
you do now.

This election is bringing up the subject of Men's
Councils again. It is an ill omen. There is always the
chance that the power may get into the hands of some
body who hasn't any friends. In that event the run on
the S. P. ticket office would be epoch-making, to remark
the minimum. Get your reservations now.

These trying days when the world is being reorgan
ized, according to the topmost brief on page two. are
liable to bring forth no end of surprise. What would
result if the committee threw open the 28th and granted
that date to your house. You haven't a date! Better
be prepared. Look at the Boy Scouts.

Now for the Explanation:
"The Gardener's Bit" is not a tool, or the reason his
wife gave the boss after he failed to show up for work!
It is the drive which will correspond to the First Mil
lion for Cabbages.
The three above submittances ought to be sufficient
to prove anything. Cabbages needs contributions.
"Just a bit, here and there, saves the gardeners lots of
hair." The statement that what we want is not money
is incomplete. We want it if it's funny. If there's a
joke in a jit, set aside the jit for Cabbages. It may buy
fertilizer for the patch if nothing else. Even the rotten
stuff has its utility. (Don't let Trim see that, Dan!)
We want communication. Tell us your troubles, if
nothing else. Maybe our exchange bureau may help you
out of the difficulty, not college, of. course. THIS

It ain't right, guys!
This life is turned about.
It is my lot
To be a Cabbage sprout.
And oft I sit
Before once flying keys
Till early morn,
, And still the darned hunch flees.
But here in class
Where vital dope is spread
I find the squib
Buzzing about my head.
What's there to do
But knock it to the floor
And rope it up?
But then the lecture's o'er!
y
To write, and then to sleep.
To flunk? —You sure are right.
Oh Justice, give a peep
For lecturing at night.
The dope, I say,
Grows but by day
Now say, guys, is it right?
—A. Lass.

Classified Ads calls our attention to the fact that the

Since there is a great risk that the press may sluff

This election is bringing up the subject of Men's

"The Gardener's Bit" is not a tool, or the reason his
wife gave the boss after he failed to show up for work!
It is the drive which will correspond to the First Mil

"Just a bit, here and there, saves the gardeners lots of
hair." The statement that what we want is not money
is incomplete. We want it if it's funny. If there's a
joke in a jit, set aside the jit for Cabbages. It may buy
fertilizer for the patch if nothing else. Even the rotten
stuff has its utility. (Don't let Trim see that, Dan!)
