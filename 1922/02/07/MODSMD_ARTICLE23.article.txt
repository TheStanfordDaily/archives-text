POPE PIUS XI
On the seventh ballot cast, Cardinal
Ratti was elected Pope yesterday.
Three years ago he was merely a
priest, one of the librarians at Ambro
sian Library in the Vatican. In 1918
he was .sent by the then Pope Benedict
on a mission to the Polish Republic
011 which he was highly successful,
and his next promotion was to the
Archbishopric of Milan, of which city
he is a native. He was made a Cardi
nal last April.
It is expected that he will continue
the liberal policies of Pope Benedict
XV, and endeavor to finally heal the
breach between church and state. Two
indications bearing out this supposi
tion have already been given. He has
j appointed Cardinal Gasparri his secre
tary of state. In his second departure
from precedent, he gave his first bless-"
ing as Pope, from an exterior loggia
of St. Peters and did not cinflne it only
to the "■faithful" assembled in the
cathedral.
AFTERMATH OF THE
WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
The fate of the seven treaties to the
: United States Senate, embodying the
results of the Limitation of Arms Con
ference will undoubtedly occupy an
important place in the minds of the
public for some time.
Speculation is already rife as to how
j and when President Harding will sub
! Mit the treaties to the Senate and who
will oppose them. Little opposition is
expected to some of the treaties, as
for instance, the "Naval Limitation
Treaty." On the other hand, the fate
of the "Four Power Pacific Pact," even
with the amendment excluding the
Japanese home-land is not so sure.i
Senator Lodge is already defending
'it and explaining that his speech of
presentation because not objected to
by the powers is an authentic interpre
tation of it. Me maintains that it is
not an entangling alliance because
I there is 110 obligations to use force.
The irreconcilables argue that there
is a moral obligation and in view of
this interpretation a reservation may
be offered even by the Foreign Rela
tions Committee of the Senate. The
content of such a reservation would be
to disclaim any moral obligation 011
j the part of the United States to use
i force in case the interest of the signa
tories were threatened.
As indicative of the French attitude
the Journal's dispatch from Paris
dated February 4, is significant.
"With the Washington Conference
at an end, coincident with the announ

cement of America's determination to
collect her European debts and her
apparent reluctance to attend the
Genoa economic conference, there is
little in the situation to furnish the
press with material for flattering
eulogies."

priest, one of the librarians at Ambro
sian Library in the Vatican. In 1918
he was .sent by the then Pope Benedict
on a mission to the Polish Republic
011 which he was highly successful,
and his next promotion was to the
Archbishopric of Milan, of which city
he is a native. He was made a Cardi
nal last April.
It is expected that he will continue
the liberal policies of Pope Benedict
XV, and endeavor to finally heal the
breach between church and state. Two
indications bearing out this supposi
tion have already been given. He has
j appointed Cardinal Gasparri his secre
tary of state. In his second departure
from precedent, he gave his first bless-"
ing as Pope, from an exterior loggia
of St. Peters and did not cinflne it only
to the "■faithful" assembled in the
cathedral.
AFTERMATH OF THE
WASHINGTON CONFERENCE
The fate of the seven treaties to the
: United States Senate, embodying the
results of the Limitation of Arms Con
ference will undoubtedly occupy an
important place in the minds of the
public for some time.
Speculation is already rife as to how
j and when President Harding will sub
! Mit the treaties to the Senate and who
will oppose them. Little opposition is
expected to some of the treaties, as
for instance, the "Naval Limitation
Treaty." On the other hand, the fate
of the "Four Power Pacific Pact," even
with the amendment excluding the
Japanese home-land is not so sure.i
Senator Lodge is already defending
'it and explaining that his speech of
presentation because not objected to
by the powers is an authentic interpre
tation of it. Me maintains that it is
not an entangling alliance because
I there is 110 obligations to use force.
The irreconcilables argue that there
is a moral obligation and in view of
this interpretation a reservation may
be offered even by the Foreign Rela
tions Committee of the Senate. The
content of such a reservation would be
to disclaim any moral obligation 011
j the part of the United States to use
i force in case the interest of the signa
tories were threatened.
As indicative of the French attitude
the Journal's dispatch from Paris
dated February 4, is significant.
"With the Washington Conference
at an end, coincident with the announ

cement of America's determination to
collect her European debts and her
apparent reluctance to attend the
Genoa economic conference, there is
little in the situation to furnish the
press with material for flattering
eulogies."
POPE PIUS XI
On the seventh ballot cast, Cardinal
Ratti was elected Pope yesterday.
Three years ago he was merely a
priest, one of the librarians at Ambro

he was .sent by the then Pope Benedict

and his next promotion was to the
