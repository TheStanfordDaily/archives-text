UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Berkeley, Calif., Feb. 7. (P. I. N. S.) —
Non-resident students who are of age,
and who have been in attendance at
the University for one year or more,
will not have to pay the non-resident
fee of $150, according to the latest rul
ing of the Board of Regents. The
whole question as to whether the uni
versity has a right to charge any spe
cial fee to any student merely be
cause he comes from a different state,
is being argued before the Supreme
Court of the state today. This action
has come about through the agita
tion of the so-called non-resident stu
dents, who have formed an "Equal
Privilege Association," and have col
lected enough money to carry the
question through court.
