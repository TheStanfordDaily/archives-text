UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eugene,
Ore., Feb. 7. (P. I. N. S.) —"If it would
only rain, I believe they would all get
well, Oregonians don't seem to thrive
on clear, cold weather." Such was the
sentiment expressed by a nurse at
the infirmary on the campus here,
where students by the score have been
confined following the wave of grip
which has swept over the university.
The ban on dances will probably be
lifted in a few days, but in the mean
time, all activities have been slowed
down greatly.
