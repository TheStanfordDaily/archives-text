# ENGLISH CLUB WILL CONDUCT ROUND TABLE
## 
### 
A Round Table meeting of the Eng
lish Club will be held this even
ing at the Kappa Alpha Theta house.
Robert Binkley, president of the club,
will preside, and original contributions
by members of the association will
form the body of the evening's pro
gram.
A series of readings by Professor
L. E. Bassett of the English depart
ment will be the feature of the meet
ing. The topic of these readings has
not been announced, but they will
probably be of a humorous nature.
Plans for the play that the club will
present on the eve of Founders' Day,
March 9, are fast taking shape and
will form part of the discussion at the
meeting tomorrow evening. The play
chosen is "If I Were King," and try
outs have practically been concluded.
Rehearsals under the direction of Gor
don Davis will start this week.
