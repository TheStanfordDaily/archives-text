# BASEBALL SEASON OPENS THURSDAY
## Alumni Will Oppose Ireland Independents to Celebrate Cliff's First Campus Game 
### 
The Cardinal baseball season will
start Thursday afternoon, when Tom
Workman's Alumni nine clashes with
Cliff Ireland's aggregation on the local
diamond. This contest will celebrate
the thirtieth anniversary of Cliff's first
game with the Stanford varsity.
In a letter to Graduate Manager
Fletcher, Workman says that the
Alumni squad has been working out
regularly for a month and is in the
pink of condition. They have played
one game, against a Los Angeles team,
carrying off the bacon with a score
of 12 to 2. He adds that they have a
million-dollar infield and Zcb Terry is
not the only star on the lineup.
Speaking of the prospects of inflict
ing a defeat upon Cliff's proteges, Work
man says: "Ireland will undoubtedly
have his usual bunch of star Big
Leaguers, but with Johnny Couch in the
box our outfielders will not need
bicycles."
On Saturday afternoon' the Stanford
Varsity will cross bats with the veterans
of Cardinal diamond history. Workman
will start Lifur on the mound in this
game, with Wickersham, a southpaw, in
reserve for emergencies.
Coach Seay is putting his men
through a mixed practice of hitting and
fielding every afternoon and will make
his final cut in the squad tomorrow.
He now has thirty-four men and will
cut that number down to about twenty
five. As yet he has made no choice
of a lineup to oppose the Alumni, al
though it is likely that Guy Draper will
be on the mound at the start.
Captain Green is still out of the game
with an injured knee and will not be
in uniform again for at least a week,
lie was out on the field yesterday after
noon. but has his knee in a cast and
is just able to get around. Other men
whom the jinx has caught are Doughty
and Nourse. candidates for berths in the
infield. Doughty was hit by a pitched
ball, breaking his jaw, and Nourse has
a bad knee.
Workman has sent the following
lineup: Catcher. Workman, 14; pitch
