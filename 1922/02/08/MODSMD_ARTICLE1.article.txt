# CONVENTION IS CAST 10 WIND IN RAM'S HEAD PLAY
## Coach Lester Seib Working on Finishing Touches of Play; Dress Rehearsal Tonight

"To think that 1 should have lived to
be called conventional," bemoans Arnold
Bayley as Purple Pearl in "Koo Koo
Kubistown."
Jt is this line which strikes the keynote
of the Ram's Head production Friday
evening. An absolute, entire and com
plete departure from the established or
der of things in plot, lines, specialties,
scenery, lighting, music, and general ef
fects is what all those connected with the
play have been attempting.
With the expectation of seeing some
thing entirely different, Palo Altoans and
students made a considerable demand for
seats when they were placed on sale yes
terday. The sale will continue until the
house is filled, at Crandall's in Palo Alto
and at the Administration Building on
the campus.
Last night the cast and chorus ran
which will include in addition to the
nine hits of the show, pictures of the
through the entire play. Because of
the fact that the Assembly Hall will
be in use Thursday evening, full dress
rehearsal will be held this evening.
An advance sale for the song-book
cast and chorus and a covor design by
Fred Fisher, '24, has been started. The
book will be partial payment on ad
mission to the dance to be held in the
Women's Clubhouse after the perform
ance Friday evening.
C. W. Midgeley, '23, has composed
an operatic quartet number in addi
tion to the music for the artistic dance
of Samuel Mendenhall, '24.
Lighting effects were tried out on
the cubistic sets last night and showed
that, although weird and unusual, the
sets will be genuinely beautiful.
They were designed by Fred Fisher,
'24, and transferred to canvas by
Clyde Coakley, '22.
