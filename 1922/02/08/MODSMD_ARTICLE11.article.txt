# ROAD ALMOST OPEN; MANUFACTURERS OF CHAINS MUST WORRY
## 
### 
1 lie Age of Chains is passing fast,
and the Open Road is once more com
ing into its own! That is to say, the
harrier to automobile traf'c that has
existed on tlie road running from the
Men's Union to the end of the car line,
past the Forge Workshops, lias been
partially removed, and even the most
timid autoist can now boldly drive along
parallel to the car tracks on his way to
the Press Building.
True, only one-half of the length of
chain has gone, and it is also true that
even the whole length didn't stop any
body who was determined (a detour via
the track was always negotiable). But
the fact remains, if this trifling incident
is a sign of anything to come, the chain
manufacturers can no longer depend on
the University for support.
