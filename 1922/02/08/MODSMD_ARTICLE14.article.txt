# PHI DELTA THETA QUINTET DEFEATS DELTA TAU DELTA
## 
### 
Phi Delta Theta's smooth working
basketball team ran true to form in
defeating Delta Tau Delta, 20 to 6,
yesterday. Kappa Sigma's champion
ship hopes were given a rude jolt by
the Encina East Fourth basketers who
came out on the long end of a 15 to G
score.
The Phi Delta Theta five did not
seem to miss Pigott, who has gone
to the varsity squad, but showed the
best team-work of their intramural
season. Fletcher, P. O'Hara, and Play
ter kept the ball most of the time, es
pecially in the second half. Fletcher
made four field goals, while O'Hara
found the basket five times. J. O'Hara
played a fast gabe at running guard
and backed up the forwards consist
ently. Kraft, standing guard, was go
ing fine at this position, and justified
his reputation of being of the best
intramural guards.
The Delta Tau Delta contingent
suffered considerably from the absence
of Kolberg who usually looms up big
at center. Austin, forward, took the
largest share of the honors, with Col
gan a close second.
The Encina-Kappa Sigma game was
a one-way contest from the start.
Horn. Newton, and Mcßurney made
the game move fast, and gave Kappa
Sigma little chance to score. Horn
threw five baskets, while Newton, and
Mcßurney bent their energies to get
ting the ball, succeeding in good
measure.
