# FAST WASHINGTON STATE QUINTET WINS FROM VARSITY BY FIVE POINTS
## COUGARS LEAD AT HALF TIME 12 TO 9; CARDINAL LINE-UP LACKS PUNCH 
### (By Garrett Elmore, '23 
After two years of effort, the Cou
gars from Washington State finally
hung a defeat on a Stanford varsity
basketball team last night. The final
score was 21 to 16.
About 1500 court fans, and as many
more vacant seats were present to see
Fred Bohler's cohorts turn the trick
in a slow game. It was the second
conference contest of the season at
Stanford.
The W. S. C. five started strong—
and finished strong. In the meantime
Van Gent's hopefuls staged two rallies
and forced the play, but they did not
have the necessary punch to overcome
the W. S. C. lead.
For the first time since the start
of the season, Jimmy Davies, the Car
dinal leader, did not finish the game.
He was forced out soon after the start

of the second half, on four personal
fouls. Davies' ability to convert free
throws was missed in the remainder of
the contest.
Van Gent's squad is out. to even up
the score tonight in the linal battle.
Davies will be back in the game, and
McHose will probably start as the
other forward. Janssen, Pitts and De-
Groot complete the Cardinal line-uj).
Washington State Light
Bohler offers something novel in the
way of a basketball team this year.
He has live light, fast, men, as a basis.
To speed he has added accurate long
range basket-shooting and a good live
man defense. McHose and Davies for
once found an opponent smaller than
themselves. He was Syers, W. S. C.
forward, and the stocky youth travels
about the court at a high rate of
speed.
The Cardinals had, to oppose that
combination, the ever-present "fight",
a defense that was good in spots, little
attack, some hard luck and —Nip Mc-
Hose. The varsity had many tries
at the goal from near the center of
the court, but few found the basket.
McHose went in for Rogers about five
minutes after the start of the game
and quickly shot two goals to put Stan
ford in the running.
Cougars Take Lead
Almost uncanny skill of the Cougar
forwards to ring the basket amazed
the spectators during the first min
utes of play. Sorensen, W. S. C. cen
ter, was the ringleader in the scoring
and Friel was his chief aide. The
former put in three shots and the
latter made a like number of free
throws count. The Stanford scoring
was confined to a couple of free throws
by Davies, and the score stood 0 to 2.
A smashing Stanford attack, cen
tered about Janssen and McHose, was
the Card : nal response to the initial
