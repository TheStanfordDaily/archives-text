# LIGHTWEIGHTS NOSE OUT PALO ALTO HIGH
## 
### 
Palo Alto's 130-pound basketball five
was nosed out of a victory by the Cardi
nal lightweights last night. The score
stood 19-18 at the final gun.
The dope was right in pointing
to the Palo Altoans as the strongest
team that has met the midgets this year.
They were a fast bunch of fighters, and
had some plays which showed that a
coach had been lining them up since the
last time the Palo Altoans visited the
campus to play the freshmen as an un
limited team.
The game was a poor spectacle. The
brand of basketball offered was not of
the highest order, and except for a few
minutes there was not much excitement
to be had in watching it. Palo Alto
furnished most of the unusual features
of the game. The long ringer which
Shaw tossed from the middle of the
floor and the speed of the Palo Alto for
ward, Poston, were the high lights of the
game. Poston stood out as easily the
best player on the high school team.
In the second half the game tightened
up somewhat. Beginning with the score
standing at 11-9 for Stanford, the visitors
started out with a rush. Draper tied the
score at 13. Baskets by Hogle and Go
wel lboosted the deadlock to the 15 mark
and then Poston converted a free throw,
putting Palo Alto in the lead for the
first time.
Hogle got .the ball somehow over at
the side of the co.urt and scored another
basket. This put the one point lead in
Stanford's favor. Stanford's basket, a
minute later, had increased the margin
to three when "Poston recovered the ball
under the Cardinal goal and ran off a
formation, dribbling rtie sphere down
to the other end, where he made the shot.
