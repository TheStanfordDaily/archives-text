# Regulating the Baseball Fight
## 
### 
Spring's approach brings out in every American
symptoms of a pleasant malady, spring fever. One
of the earliest signs of the contraction of that delight
ful disease is ,the desire of every American hoy to
play baseball. The music of symphony orchestras is
not nearly so attractive to the ordinary American dur
ing this period of the year as the crack of the hat
meeting the ball. And, if you are on the business
end of the bat you experience a feeling that is inde
scribable when you hit one squarely on the nose.
Baseball in Stanford has another significance be
sides that of intercollegiate competition. It means
here, the time of the annual baseball fight between the
sophomores and freshmen.
Last year the basebal fight was stopped because
the second-year men. looking for an advantage,
started the battle two days before they should have.
Camps were established in the hills, and preliminary
skirmishes were indulged in which resulted in several
men being injured. Because of the ill-feeling en
gendered by these unwarranted engagements the
Men's Council decided that the best thing to do was
to call oft" the fight.
The baseball fight is worth while, because if it is
properly conducted it is a real battle of brains.
Leadership is developed and real thinking is required
of the class in possession of the ball to get it back to
the baseball captain without losing it to the opposing
group. But there is no necessity for camps in the
hills or preliminary battles of any kind.
Regulation is necessary if the baseball fight is to
remain as a tradition of Stanford. An upperclass
committee should be appointed to have direct super
vision over the fight. A committee in each class
should confer with the upperclass committee to ob
tain a clear understanding of the purposes and con
duct of the battle of wits. This committee in each
of the combatting classes should be held responsible
for the conduct of the fight by its own group.
No specific date should be set for the contest. It
should be sufficient to each class involved to know
that it will be staged on any day within a certain week.
At noon of any day word could be passed to the two
committees that at 4 o'clock the two classes would
meet on the baseball diamond for the clash. Camps
in the hills and preliminaries would thus be impos
sible.
Before 5:30 the baseball game will have been
played and one class will have obtained possession
v>f the ball. An hour of rest between six and seven;
an hour in which to plan the strategic measures neces
sary for returning the ball to the Varsity Captain
should be allowed.
From seven to eight the classes would again come
together, the one to get the ball to the Captain, the
other to try to prevent. By eight o'clock the fight
should be over. There should be no heads broken and
no injured feelings.
Under such a plan strategy rather than physical
force will be necessary. Ml of the benefits from such
a contest will l>e preserved. The classes will be united
for the last time this year in a common purpose.
Class consciousness will be awakened and university
spirit promoted. Lastly, the combatants will not be
kept from their studies for more than four hours.
