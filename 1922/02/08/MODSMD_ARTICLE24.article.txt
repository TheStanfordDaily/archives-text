# The 						Business of Discipline

### 
The question of Freshman discipline clarifies
itself pretty well upon careful thought and consid
eration into one leading proposition. We arc mak
ing too serious a business out of disciplining the
first year men.
It is "Frosh," do that, or you will he punished."
The day when a smart sophomore or uppperclass

man could by some ingenious method outwii
freshman and by cajoling, rather than threaten
him, produce results seems to have passed. Eitl
the present undergraduate lacks the ability to o
think the newcomer, and in outthinking him
derive a lot of fun, or he does not care to exerc
his integrity when a more stabilized form of dis
cipline is already known to him.
Therefore, freshman discipline is made a busi
ness by the sophomores who care more about seeing
the freshmen walk a chalk-line marked out by them
selves, than they do alxnit getting into an activity
that will benefit them as well as Stanford. Not
only do they waste their own precious time and
energy, but very often discipline and duties cause the
new men to flunk out and the University suffers a
loss that it cannot well afford, besides ruining or,
at least, causing the interruption, of the freshman's
Rushing is sufficient cause for distraction during
college career.
Rushing is sufficient cause for distraction during
the first year. Duties of various kinds have become
so enlarged that they, too, keep the first year man
from entering into an activity, although steps are
being taken to minimize this distraction. But when
the freshman is subjected to a severe paddling or
tubbing merely because someone thinks he is cocky,
two things are certain to happen to him. The first
is that he is antagonized and converted into a fit
person to carry on the newly named tradition of
hazing. -The other is that he is prevented from
finding his feet during the first year, and more
especially during the first quarter. The task of
learning how to study in the University and of how
to find an activity that best suits him is enough to
asked of him as part of his apprenticeship in the
new occupation of acquiring higher education. If
the sophomore would attend to his own business,
which is, primarily, doing all that he can to help
himself and the University while he is here, Stan
ford would become a greater college.
The day when sophomores filled a freshman
meeting and elected one of their own number presi
dent, to the subsequent chagrin of the new men, is
past. That requires some exercise of the brain,
while to swing a paddle or douse a man in a tub
requires nothing more than a gang with strong
arms and backs. No sophomore ever starts out to
discipline a freshman alone, lie always looks for
others of his class with firm faith in the adage that
"In union there is strength."
There is a certain fascination in playing a joke
on a newcomer that is an aid to him in helping him to
find his place. There is certainly nothing in the
present forms of discipline that appeal to the true
sportsman and that is what most college men like to
be called.
