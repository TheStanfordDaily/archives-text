# Two "Y" Organizations To Hold Joint Cabinet Dinner
## 
### 
The Stanford Y. M. C. A. will be
the host at a dinner to be given Thurs
day night to the Y. W. C. A. The
dinner will be held in the Women*'
Clubhouse, and will start at six o'clock.
The cabinet members and heads of
committees are those who will attend.
Speeches from both Y. M. and Y. W.
members have been planned, and the
main purpose of the gathering will be
to work out a closer plan of co-opera
tion between the two "Y's" here on the
campus, so that more can be accom
plished by the combining of activities
that may duplicate or conflict. This
meeting is the second of the kind to be
held this year, a previous "get-together"
having been held last quarter.
