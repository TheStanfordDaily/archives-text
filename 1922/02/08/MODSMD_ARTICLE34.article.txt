# EXPERIENCED WOMEN TENNIS PLAYERS ARE NEEDED FOR CONTEST
## 
### 
More experienced women tennis play
ers are needed for the intercollegiate
tournaments to be held next month with
California. Each class team should have
four players who have entered previous
games either at Stanford or for other
institutions. The Seniors have a good
lineup, with Myra Waterman and Irma
Outsell working up well in practice.
Both have had much experience in the
game and will prove strong in the tour
naments. The Juniors claim a real
player in Frances Fish, who has earned
a reputation in previous work as one.
of the best women racquet wielders
Stanford has produced in some years.
Carolyn Strouse seems to be the fore
most entrant on the Freshman squad.

She plays* a strong, fast game and is
steadily improving with conscientious
practice.
Though the numbers trying for teams
are large, the material is not altogether
satisfactory, and all women who have
made teams in the past are urged to
take an interest in the spring tourna
ments and begin practice immediately.
