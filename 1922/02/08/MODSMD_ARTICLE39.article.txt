# Herbert Hoover Sends Letter on Endowment Work
## 
### 
A letter has been received today by
President Wilbur from Herbert Hoover,
in which he expresses enthusiasm over
the endowment campaign. A copy of
the letter follows:
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President, Stanford University,
Stanford University, Calif.
My Dear President Wilbur: I wel
come the appeal of the University for
assistance from its alumni. Our Uni
versity must now depend for its great
ness upon its alumni. It will go ahead
just so fast as we take the burden of
support. It stands for more than "our"
University whose stamp we value. It is
the only great independent University in
the West. It can and does exert an in
fluence upon the whole academic stand
ards of the West through this very in
dependence. Assistance to Stanford is
assistance to every one of our educa
tional institutions.
Yours faithfully,
(Signed) HERBERT HOOVER.
