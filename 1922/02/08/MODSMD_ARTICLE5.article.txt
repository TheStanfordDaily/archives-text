# Manufacturers of Wit Are Summoned To House of Judge
## 
### 
College wits, attention ! Line up and
count off from the write! There is await
ing any wit, near-wit, or even half-wit, a
chance to win fame and fortune for him
self, or herself, and the Alma Mater.
Briefly, tlie plot is this:
Judge, the national weekly, is prepar
ing to put out another College Wits'
Number this spring. This issue of the
magazine will contain only contributions
submitted by college students. Any stu
dent, anywhere, can send in jokes, or
sketches, or more pretentious works of
prose, or full-page drawings, with a good
chance of getting them accepted.
All contributions accepted will be
printed with the author's name attached,
and will be paid for at a lucrative rate.
Fame and fortune are thus killed with
the same stone. Contributors should
print plainly their name, their class ('22,
'23, etc.), and "Stanford" when sending
in their masterpieces. Hammer and
Coffin makes this appeal to the campus
at large so that Stanford will be able to
make as good a showing as any eastern
college in this contest. A huge silver
loving-cup goes to the university which
has the greatest amount of material ac
cepted.
Co-ed jokes are not barred.
