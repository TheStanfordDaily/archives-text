# JOHN MILLS SPEAKS ON RADIO TELEPHONY
## 
### 
John Mills spoke on "1 lie Human
Voice and Jts Electrical Transmission"
last night in the Little Theater. He is
the assistant personnel manager of the
General Electric Company. This lecture
is one of a series which lie has been mak
ing in the larger cities of the northwest.
The lecture was illustrated with a dem
onstrating apparatus and with stereop
tican views and moving pictures. Mills
had a telephone transmitter on the plat
form. which was connected with a re
ceiver in one corner of the room and to
which an amplifier was attached. By
talking into the transmitter his voice was
greatly amplified.
the iust part of his talk. Mills
explained the workings of the human
voice which, lie said, is very much like
an organ pipe. The sounds made by the
vocal cords are caused by pressure on
their membranes which allows the air
to escape. Every sound produced by the
human voice contains a fundamental
note and a greater or less number of
harmonics. Jsy demonstration, Mills
showed on the screen examples of what
the waves of air look like when sounds
arc produced.
He then took up the mechanics of the
ear. Charts were shown of the different
sounds in the English language and the
ease with which they may be heard at
different volumes. Some sounds, such as
"f" and "th," are never clearly under
stood, while others, of which "1"is an
example, rank one hundred per cent
through the entire range in which a
sound is audible to the human ear.
Mills explained the construction and
uses of the audion, which is an electrical
device that utilizes the electrons found
in a vacuum. The audion is used as an
amplifier of sound. It has been called
the "magic bottle" of electricity. It
raises imperceptible amounts of power
to useful proportions. This little instru
ment makes communication by telephone
across the continent possible.
"In the radio telephone," Mills ex
plained, "the radio waves are converted
back into audible sounds by use of the
audions. Modulation is one of the phe
nomena which make the telephone pos
sible. All telephony is the result of
transmission of a modulated current or
wave."
A film of wireless telephony was
shown to illustrate Mills' explanation of
that process. "Sound waves travel like
water, and electric waves travel in ether.
Sound waves which carry far are carried
by electric waves. The audion is the de
vice which combines the voice and sound
waves."

explained the workings of the human
voice which, lie said, is very much like
an organ pipe. The sounds made by the
vocal cords are caused by pressure on
their membranes which allows the air
to escape. Every sound produced by the
human voice contains a fundamental
note and a greater or less number of
harmonics. Jsy demonstration, Mills
showed on the screen examples of what
the waves of air look like when sounds
arc produced.
He then took up the mechanics of the
ear. Charts were shown of the different
sounds in the English language and the
ease with which they may be heard at
different volumes. Some sounds, such as
"f" and "th," are never clearly under
stood, while others, of which "1"is an
example, rank one hundred per cent
through the entire range in which a
sound is audible to the human ear.
Mills explained the construction and
uses of the audion, which is an electrical
device that utilizes the electrons found
in a vacuum. The audion is used as an
amplifier of sound. It has been called
the "magic bottle" of electricity. It
raises imperceptible amounts of power
to useful proportions. This little instru
ment makes communication by telephone
across the continent possible.
"In the radio telephone," Mills ex
plained, "the radio waves are converted
back into audible sounds by use of the
audions. Modulation is one of the phe
nomena which make the telephone pos
sible. All telephony is the result of
transmission of a modulated current or
wave."
A film of wireless telephony was
shown to illustrate Mills' explanation of
that process. "Sound waves travel like
water, and electric waves travel in ether.
Sound waves which carry far are carried
by electric waves. The audion is the de
vice which combines the voice and sound
waves."
