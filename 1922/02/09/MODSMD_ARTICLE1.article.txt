# REHEARSAL SHOWS KUBISTOWN READY FOR PRESENTATION
## Finishing Touches Are Given Ram's Head Show; Tickets On Sale Today and Friday 
### 
"Koo-Koo-Kubistown" sailed through
the final rehearsal yesterday evening in
the Assembly Hall, with costumes, stage
sets, and all s in practically the same con
dition in which they will appear Friday
night. From beginning to end, no detail
was overlooked by Coach Les Seib, and
the linal polish the show needed was ap
plied.
This dress rehearsal offered the final
opportunity before the show to see how
the costumes and lighting combine with
the peculiar stage sets. Different com
binations of light were tried, and the
best ones decided upon. Throughout the
show the three factors of stage sets,
costumes, and lighting figure even more
prominently than in the ordinary show,
in determining how the performance
shall get across. This is due to the
novelty which characterizes this year's
Ram's Head production from the begin
ning to the end.
There are still plenty of good seats for
sale, according to an announcement from
the business management this morning.
Tickets can be procured at Crandall's in
Palo Alto, or at the box office in the
Administration Building. The latter
office will be open from 1 to 4 this after
noon, and from 11 to 12 in the morning
and 1 to 4 in the afternoon tomorrow.
The box office near the Assembly Hall
doors will open at 7 :30 tomorrow night,
and those who have not purchased their
tickets before then can do so at that
time. Roughs will have absolutely no
chance to see any part of the show free
of charge, as a policy even stricter than
that maintained at "The Charm School"
will be enforced.
The "Gold Dust Twins of Pleasure"—
song and dance—will both have a place
on tomorrow night's program. After
the show a dance will be held at the
Women's Clubhouse, and the price of ad
mission to this will be the music score
plus twenty-five cents. The music score,
which will be distributed at the Assem
bly Hall, contains the nine song hits of
the show, bound in an attractive cover.
Preliminary information would seem to
indicate that these s ngs will be as per
manent "hits" as those which were put
out by the Junior Opera last year. Those
who fail to secure copies of the music
score must pay seventy-five cents ad
mission to the dance.
