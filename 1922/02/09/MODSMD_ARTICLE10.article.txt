# ELECTION TO MEN'S COUNCIL DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL
## 
### 
Vacancies on the Men's Council were
not filled at the election yesterday.
An amendment whereby two juniors
and one senior were to be elected to the
Men's Council at each mid-year election
was passed by the students at the elec
tion last spring. According to the con
stitution of the Associated Students, an
amendment must appear in the Daily
Palo Alto three times before it becomes
a part of the Constitution. This amend
ment appeared but once in the Dailv Palo
Alto.
Members of the election board were
under the impression that the amendment
was constitutional, and the election for
Men's Council was conducted on this
basis. This will make possible one or
two alternatives. Either the amendment
must be made constitutional or the Men's
Council must dcclare it unconstitutional,
and go back to the former system of
electing only seniors.
As soon as a decision is made, a new
election will be held. The number of
vacancies and the eligibility of candi
dates will depend on the ruling of the
Men's Council.
