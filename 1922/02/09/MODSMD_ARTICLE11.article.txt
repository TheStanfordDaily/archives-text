# FRESHMAN COURT TEAM BEATS LICK-WILMERDING
## 
### 
The Freshman Basketball Team de
feated the Lick-Wilmerding High
School team, 44 to 11, in a loose game
last night.
From the first it was apparent that
the poorly organized high school boys
were no match for the Babe quintet.
The light prep school players seem
ed to have very little knowledge of
basketball, the freshman forwards
scoring almost at will.
The one bright spot in an other
wise dull game was the playing of
Driscoll, Cardinal forward. Scoring
eight field goals in three quarters of
play, he was the only player on the
floor playing a hard and effective game
of basketball. This is the second time
this season that Driscoll has found the
basket consistently during a game,
the other time being in the College
of Pacific* game.
Steele and Shipke both expended a
great deal of effort in following the
ball, both of them attempting long
shots from all angles and places on
the floor. Steele succeeded in plac
ing seven, while Shipke had to be
content with one field goal.
Younger, lanky center of the Lick-
Wilmerding team, found the basket
three times during the evening, but
most of the shots of the high school
forwards failed to strike the back
boards.
