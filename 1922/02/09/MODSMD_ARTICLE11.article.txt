# FRESHMAN COURT TEAM BEATS LICK-WILMERDING
## 
### 
The Freshman Basketball Team de
feated the Lick-Wilmerding High
School team, 44 to 11, in a loose game
last night.
From the first it was apparent that
the poorly organized high school boys
were no match for the Babe quintet.
The light prep school players seem
ed to have very little knowledge of
basketball, the freshman forwards
scoring almost at will.
The one bright spot in an other
wise dull game was the playing of
Driscoll, Cardinal forward. Scoring
eight field goals in three quarters of
play, he was the only player on the
floor playing a hard and effective game
of basketball. This is the second time
