# STANFORD WRESTLERS PREPARE FOR MATCH
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney is working his
wrestling team hard this week in prepa
ration for the match with the Olympic
t lub which lias definitely been decided
upon, and will take place at the clubmen's
gym, February 17. Accoring to Vaughn
Hosepian. wrestling instructor, the
strength of the 1922 team is yet undcter-
I minable, chic to the fact that there arc
! three untried men on the teamâ€”Sturm.
Boyle, and Nave.
The team will be considerably weak
j ened by the absence of Dick Johnson and
"Revo" Bniliard, two of the star grap
| piers on last year's team. The former is
out of competition because of a sprained
ankle, and the latter because of recent
sickness. It is hoped that these men
will have recovered by the time of the
big l>out with the Bruins which is sched
uled for March 7 at Harmon gym.
