# STANFORD DROPS SECOND CONTEST TO WASHINGTON STATE QUINTET, 15 TO 13
## Sorenson, W.S.C. Center, Makes Goal That Breaks Deadlock; Strong Defenses Keep Score Down 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
1 lie speedy Washington State basket
ball team left for other parts today, but
it tarried long enough last evening to
nose out the Stanford varsity, 15 to 13,
after a stormy session on the pavilion
court.
The Cougars retaliated in a measure
for the defeats handed them by Cardinal
quintets in the past two years, for they
made a clean sweep of their two-game
series here, and jumped from sixth to
fourth in the conference standings at the
expense of Van Gent's basket shooters.
Bud Kearns, the angular gentleman
with the dramatic method of calling
fouls, was supreme grand arbitrator last
night, and lie had a hard time of it.
There was constant wrangling all eve
ning and the game was halted for several

minutes in the first half to settle the
question of how many personal fouls had
been called on Sayers, the little Cougar
forward. Nobody won.
Sorenson Shoots Deciding Goal
Three minutes before the end of the
game, with the score tied at 13-13,
Sorenson, W .S. C. center, got the hall
near mid-court and hurled it toward the
Stanford goal. It went through the
'basket without touching the metal ring,
and won the game for the visitors.
Up to that time, the quintets had been
deadlocked. Van Gent's hopefuls went
into the final period on the wrong end
of a 9-7 score, but a free thrown by
Davies, and une of Dick Richmond's
special long shots from right center, put
them ahead. Davies, not to be outdone
by the running guard, hurled one in from
the center of the court.
Schroeder and Loomis for Washington
State evened the count at 12-12. A free
throw apiece advanced the score one
notch. The play see-sawed from one
end of the court to the other with neither
team able to get close to the other's goal.
Sorenson then broke up the entertain
ment with his well-placed shot.
Fight-to-Finish Battle
it was evident from the start that the
game was not going to be any gentle ex
hibition of the winter pastime, for both
quintets went at it hammer and tongs.
Davies made four fouls called on the
Cougars' count, and Friel converted one.
Sorenson started his evening's work
with a long shot and Friel put in a field
goal. With the score 5-5 McHose wnt
in for Kogers. Sayers scored his only
points of the evening, but McHose
evened the count with a field goal. Friel
tallied two more, and then the big argu
ment took place, and play stopped.
Friel got into a tangle with Janssen,
which resulted in the Cougar captain's
being banished from the game for slug
ging.
Introducing an Old Friend
Dick Richmond, nemesis of Washing
ton State basketball teams, returned to
the game after a week's enforced lay
off. The veteran running guard waged
good defensive battle, and broke through
for one field goal. He did not have the
Indian sign on the Cougar quintet to as
great an extent as he has had in the past
two years, however.
Davies was high point man in the race
for scoring honors, with nine to his
credit. The Cardinal captain gathered in
seven out of twelve free throws.
Stanford Lacks Scoring Power
The Cardinal five stopped the Cougar
attack very effectively, and the visitors
were confined to long distance tries.
I Jollier's men made many of their at
tempts count, however, as they dropped
the ball in the basket from every angle.
An effective Washington State de
fense prevented the Cardinal forwards
from doing any damage under the basket.
Davies, McHose, and Janssen had many
tries at the goal, but too many of them
went wild. Davies missed four free
throws when points were in demand,
which might have win the fracas for
Stanford.
The box score:
Stanford— F.G. F.T. Pts.
Davies, forward 17 9

1 lie speedy Washington State basket
ball team left for other parts today, but
it tarried long enough last evening to
nose out the Stanford varsity, 15 to 13,
after a stormy session on the pavilion
court.
The Cougars retaliated in a measure
for the defeats handed them by Cardinal
quintets in the past two years, for they
made a clean sweep of their two-game
series here, and jumped from sixth to
fourth in the conference standings at the
expense of Van Gent's basket shooters.
Bud Kearns, the angular gentleman
with the dramatic method of calling
fouls, was supreme grand arbitrator last
night, and lie had a hard time of it.
There was constant wrangling all eve
ning and the game was halted for several

minutes in the first half to settle the
question of how many personal fouls had
been called on Sayers, the little Cougar
forward. Nobody won.
Sorenson Shoots Deciding Goal
Three minutes before the end of the
game, with the score tied at 13-13,
Sorenson, W .S. C. center, got the hall
near mid-court and hurled it toward the
Stanford goal. It went through the
'basket without touching the metal ring,
and won the game for the visitors.
Up to that time, the quintets had been
deadlocked. Van Gent's hopefuls went
into the final period on the wrong end
of a 9-7 score, but a free thrown by
Davies, and une of Dick Richmond's
special long shots from right center, put
them ahead. Davies, not to be outdone
by the running guard, hurled one in from
the center of the court.
Schroeder and Loomis for Washington
State evened the count at 12-12. A free
throw apiece advanced the score one
notch. The play see-sawed from one
end of the court to the other with neither
team able to get close to the other's goal.
Sorenson then broke up the entertain
ment with his well-placed shot.
Fight-to-Finish Battle
it was evident from the start that the
game was not going to be any gentle ex
hibition of the winter pastime, for both
quintets went at it hammer and tongs.
Davies made four fouls called on the
Cougars' count, and Friel converted one.
Sorenson started his evening's work
with a long shot and Friel put in a field
goal. With the score 5-5 McHose wnt
in for Kogers. Sayers scored his only
points of the evening, but McHose
evened the count with a field goal. Friel
tallied two more, and then the big argu
ment took place, and play stopped.
Friel got into a tangle with Janssen,
which resulted in the Cougar captain's
being banished from the game for slug
ging.
Introducing an Old Friend
Dick Richmond, nemesis of Washing
ton State basketball teams, returned to
the game after a week's enforced lay
off. The veteran running guard waged
good defensive battle, and broke through
for one field goal. He did not have the
Indian sign on the Cougar quintet to as
great an extent as he has had in the past
two years, however.
Davies was high point man in the race
for scoring honors, with nine to his
credit. The Cardinal captain gathered in
seven out of twelve free throws.
Stanford Lacks Scoring Power
The Cardinal five stopped the Cougar
attack very effectively, and the visitors
were confined to long distance tries.

tempts count, however, as they dropped
the ball in the basket from every angle.

Sorenson started his evening's work
with a long shot and Friel put in a field
goal. With the score 5-5 McHose wnt
in for Kogers. Sayers scored his only
points of the evening, but McHose
evened the count with a field goal. Friel
tallied two more, and then the big argu
ment took place, and play stopped.
Friel got into a tangle with Janssen,
which resulted in the Cougar captain's
being banished from the game for slug
ging.
Introducing an Old Friend
Dick Richmond, nemesis of Washing
ton State basketball teams, returned to
the game after a week's enforced lay
off. The veteran running guard waged
good defensive battle, and broke through
for one field goal. He did not have the
Indian sign on the Cougar quintet to as
great an extent as he has had in the past
two years, however.
Davies was high point man in the race
for scoring honors, with nine to his
credit. The Cardinal captain gathered in
seven out of twelve free throws.
Stanford Lacks Scoring Power
The Cardinal five stopped the Cougar
attack very effectively, and the visitors
were confined to long distance tries.
I Jollier's men made many of their at
tempts count, however, as they dropped
the ball in the basket from every angle.
An effective Washington State de
fense prevented the Cardinal forwards
from doing any damage under the basket.
Davies, McHose, and Janssen had many
tries at the goal, but too many of them
went wild. Davies missed four free
throws when points were in demand,
which might have win the fracas for
Stanford.
