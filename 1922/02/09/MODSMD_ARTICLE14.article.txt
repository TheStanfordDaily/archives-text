# SECOND STAGE OF ENDOWMENT APPEAL TO START MONDAY
## Continuation Committee With A. W. Taylor Will Direct Two Weeks' Final Effort 
### 
The second half of the campus endow
ment campaign will start next Monday.
Under Chairman A. R. Tyler, of the con
tinuation committee, complete reorgani
zation of system, rechecking of lists, and
appointment of a new corps of workers
began today. This committee, which
will be composed of two men and one
woman from the freshman, sophomore,
and junior classes, will be the adminis
trative head of the second stage of the
student appeal, and is to direct a two
weeks' program which will include - every
member of the university who is now in
the 34 per cent who have not yet been
interviewed.
New groups of workers are to be ap
pointed, although the living group chair
men at present serving will be generally
retained. From records now 011 hand in
the endowment offices, the university di
rectory will be used to compile lists of
those who have not yet contributed, of
those who have given only on a cash
basis in ignorance of the five-year pay
ment plan, and of those whose changed
addresses have made them inaccessible
before.
Besides having charge of the canvass
ing to start Monday for the remainder
of the $200,000 quota set, the continua
tion committee, a permanent body ap
pointed yearly, will look after the pledg
ing of incoming students, and maintain
payments on present pledges. The com
mittee is also to act as a liaison body be
tween the campus organization and the
endowment directors of the alumni cam
paign. and will have charge of special en
tertainments to raise funds. A perma
nent chairman and secretary treasurer
will be appointed yearly, with offices in
the Adminitsration Building. The work
among the new students will continue
until 1927, with no abatement after the
present quota has been raised.
Announcement of the members of the
committee will be made by A. R. Tyler
tomorrow. Today, work on rechecking
lists, with a view to reapportioning as
signments for the new corps of workers,
is being pushed.
