# WISCONSIN CALLS OFF DUAL MEET WITH U. C.
## 
### 
The University of Wisconsin has called
off the dual track meet with California
scheduled for this spring, according to
a statement made public today.
This meet was to have been of the
same kind as the other dual meets with
U. C. has lately made a specialty, in
meeting eastern universities. No ex
planation was given by the Wisconsin
team as to the reason for calling off the
meet, but it is presumed that the time
needed for the trip would hamper
scholastic standing. The meet was to
have been held on University Day, April
15. Wisconsin was reputed to have a
team that would make U. C. extend her
self, especially as the Bears have lost a
good deal of their last year's strength.
