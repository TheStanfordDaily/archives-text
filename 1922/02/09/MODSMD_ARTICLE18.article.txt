# This Makes It Unanimous

President David P. Barrows of the University
of California agrees with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur of Stanford that intercollegiate athletics
have too much of good in them to be given up by
the colleges. Harry B. Smith, the sporting editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle, interviewed Presi
dent Wilbur and later asked Dr. Barrows to express
his views. President Barrows began, in fact, by
saying, "First of all, I want to say I am thoroughly
in accord with the views expressed by Dr. Wilbur
and that I fully echo his sentiments."
Which is cheerful; the presidents, at least, both
think what Dr. Wilbur first said.
But Dr. Barrows had some things to say on his
own account, and the most interesting things are
those that Dr. Wilbur did not say. Dr. Wilbur did
not, for instance, develop his ideas about the kind
of East-West contests that worked out rather un
comfortably this winter at Pasadena. President
Wilbur merely intimated that he thought that when
colleges of two sections play each other they should
meet because they themselves want to play each
other, and should play on the campus of one of them,
and not because some outside body determines that
the contests should be held, and at a certain place
selected by that outside party.
President Barrows was in a position to be more
, and he declared: "In a sense I favor inter
:l games, but I am not so strong for the East
<t contest, certainly not every year. It is un
e that communities should feel they have the
right to make demands on us for games simply for
their own pleasure. If I can prevent it, our univer
sity will never be put into the position of being under
obligations to play merely for the gratification of
some community." As President Barrows said, that
is President Wilbur's position, and it is good to have
it unanimous. Unthinkable the idea may be, but Dr.
Barrows himself says he received at least six tele
grams from one such community demanding in the
name of the taxpayers that the U. C. team play there.
It will be fine if college sports are retained as college
sports primarily and not converted into being pri
marily public spectacles.
President Barrows made one little slip in com
menting on the expenses of athletics and the matter
of stadiums, which Stanford enthusiasts will want to
correct him on. Ile doesn't think that colleges should
"spend money like water" on athletics, and he is
somewhat afraid of extravagance following the large
amounts collected from the public for admission to
the games. "That is one reason." he said, with a
laugh, "why I favor the building of large stadiums.
For the next ten or fifteen years our student bodies
will be so busy paying for these improvements they
will have no opportunity to acquire extravagant
habits."
Not Stanford, Dr. Barrows. Stanford will have
its stadium paid for within two or three years. Its
stadium cost less than $200,000, and it did not sell
tickets for the next ten or fifteen years to raise the
money.
"After our stadiums are paid for." President Bar
rows continued, "we must find other academic use
for the funds that will be received."
Fine idea! But Stanford doesn't have to find it;
it has already found it and is employing it. The very
building of the stadium was made to contribute to
these "other academic uses," and after the stadium is
wholly paid for the same method of making a por
tion of the income from athletics support other aca
demic enterprises will be continued.
All the University of California has to do is to
follow the course already taken by Stanford, and
President Barrow's vision will be a reality for both
universities, as it already is tor Stanford. Doily
