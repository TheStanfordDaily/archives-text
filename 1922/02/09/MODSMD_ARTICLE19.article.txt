Dear Head of Cabbage:
Laugh (at yourself) and the world laughs with you,
Laugh (at the world) and you laugh alone.
For the mad old earth can see in you mirth,
But none in itself will it own.

So, Comrade Hal, accept my sincerest condolence. We
have razzed others and the editor has refused to run our
stuff. But as long as we razz our colleagues it'll be run
and we shall obtain giggles from the men and now and
then campus women will be known to emit those so
phisticated smiles that come only with a college educa
tion and its candies. The more of either the more self
contained the smile. The following, as you know, it not
a razz on you but it comes under this general head:

A Cabbage Colleague and Thursday came down on
the 8:15 Sunday and we wanted a movie magazine so
he bought it. He told me in return to write a pome
on the first picture in it In as many minutes as it had
lines.
* * *
It was that picture of the etiquette ad of a gent walk
ing between two ladies, with the caption, "What's
Wrong?"
C.C. said there was nothing wrong he could see; that
girls always wanted him to walk between them.
* * •
I told him that I didn't go out much with girls when
I was a young man but I believed that he was right;
that many women hunt in pairs and wanted an even
break on game; but that the etiquette rule was not
made for their benefit but for the man who 10-1 has
a preference, especially if one is his sister.
* t *
So C.C., says I, walk next to the gutter where you be
long and take your favorite's arm.
* * *
Suppose the other complains, says C.C., tell me in
your pome what to say.
♦ * •
Between the two? The form is bad.
The wit is even less;
The reason of the same I'm sure
Is not too hard to guess.
There's always one you like the best.
So walk right next the street.
With Her in middle, hold Her arm,
The trick is really neat.
Of course I know such etiquette
Will set 'tother chirpin',
But simply say, in bland-like way,
"You want me like Ben Turpin?"
* # *
Send us your troubles. We even advised Clyde
Gunter, altho he didn't take it.

Dear Thursday:—l can write to you with a clear con
science that nothing I say will be repeated only in the
colyum that you run, can't I? I want to tell you what
I think about that awful old election board and their
underhanded way *of running the seat-drawings for the
jobs on the campus. I got the dope on good sure terms
that I got more votes for vice-president of the sopho
more class than anybody in the class and I think it is
a shame that I am not given the office'especially after
1 got all my sisters and the hasher to go down and
write my name on the ballots. There were an. awful
lots of people ran for the office, almost a score, and I
got thirteen votes which is five more than my nearest
competitor totalled and she shouldn't be mad because
she had two for treasurer also which I think ought to
make her want to give me the office. The election board
says that the constitution says that there must be a
majority for an election. Well I got more than anybody
else, and there couldn't be a majority on account of the
number of girls and boys that wanted the office, so 1
think that I ought to be the vice-pres. What shall I do?
Anyhow, 1 thank my sisters and the hasher for the un
animous vote that 1 received —from them.
POLLY TITIAN.

Affable Andy rises and growls that it certainly bane
a popular office, that vice-pres of the sophomore class.
Never knew before that 19 fellers in college had friends
who would write in names on ballots. Also remarks that
it don't seem right for this white ballot deal to be
binding. It don't give a feller no chance to vote intelli
gently, just lays the one thing before him, and the only
other one he can vote for is nobody, and who's he?

ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
Dear Section Boss—as a member of the Vote Counters
Union, Local 900, I think this thing of write-in votes has
gone far enough. We got a way of counting the votes
that is all to the good when they are printed on the
ballots, but when they are put on in longhand, sanscrit,
and semaphore like yesterday, you can't do 'em all
justice with the limited black boards that they provide
in the Polly Si building. I am for scrapping the Water
man, Conklin, and Shaeffer League, along with the
navies and sticking to the printed appelations.
Yours for prohibition, tKANT REEDUM.

Pss-t-y Cat, Pss-t-y Cat, where have you been?
I've taken to writing to razz the men.
Pss-t-y Cat, Pss-t-y Cat, how did you fare?
I scotched a mouse neath my editor's chair.
* * •
If that's too subtle, let's talk English. If ever there
has been a pla<;e on this green and brown earth where
restrictions on women has given them opportunity for
irony that place has been Stanford, but all they produce
is a traditional, hackneyed 'razz," good enough as froth,
but insipid because it doesn't hit at real things. It's not
satire, but flattery, yes flattery—"it's an honor to rate
a razz" opineth the public. In 190(5 the women edited
"Chappie" and the earth groaned in anguish at the stuff,
resulting in the disastrous "fire." Next month they edit
it again. I'd like to see some Misses Waggs of the Cab
bage Patch. I'd like to see a feminine Swift or Twain
enter Stanford and even up for her sex all the years
the women have been the targets. But, alas, the world
has never produced a master woman satislst!
