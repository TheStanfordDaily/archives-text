# ALPHA DELTA PHI WINS COURT BOUT FROM SIGMA CHI
## 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi basket men took a
firmer grip on the championship honors
of league five, yesterday, by winning
from Sigma Chi, IS to 8. Delta Chi ran
up a 20-9 score on Alpha Sigma Phi.
The Sigma Chi players evidently had
some designs on the bronze plaque them
selves, judging from the scrap they put
up. Alpha Delta Phi started off with a
substantial lead, but this advantage was
cut down to 8-6 before half time was
called.
Both teams took the floor with malice
aforethought in the second half. Each
set of forwards carried the ball down the
court only to lose it when within striking
distance of the goal. This see-saw play
went on for about live minutes with no
scoring. Then, two free throws con
verted hy Neer, and a field goal, tossed
from the side, by Dennis, raised the
Alpha Delt lead to six points. In the
final ten minutes the Sigma Chi defense
was unable to stop the attack of the
winners, which netter three field goals.
Alpha Delta Phi used a three-man de
fense instead of the usual five. This
was made possible by thÂ«. high class
guarding of Pollard and Loomis. Dennis
was the fastest man on the court, and
his defense work was very effective.
Neer was the most consistent player,
and made half the total number of points.
Pollard, running guard, scored two long
range shots.
Delta Chi and Alpha Sigma Phi played
a slow contest with the result never in
doubt. Coplen, forward, and Tritle, run
ning guard, played in good form and
with plenty of fight. Roth men scored
four field goals. Welsh and Moore made
up the backbone of the Alpha Sigma Phi
quintet, showing considerable ability.
However, the losers did not work to
gether as well as they shoiild at this
time of the season.
