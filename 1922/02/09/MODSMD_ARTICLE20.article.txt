THE TEN-YEAR HOLIDAY BEGINS
The United States suspends work to
day on 14 big war vessels—B battleships
and 6 battle cruisers. The saving will
be approximately $5,000,000 a month. If
the live-power pact on the limitation of
naval armaments is ratified, only three
of these ships will be used as war ves
sels. The Colorado, already 90 per cent
completed, will be retained, and two of
the battle cruisers will be converted into
airplane carriers. Japan has also
stopped work on the eight ships building
in her yards, and will turn the labor
hitherto used on the big ships to the
construction of auxiliary craft. The
official close of the Washington confer
ence was announced in the Japanese Diet
during a debate in which the Japanese
government was being criticised for not
securing a limitation of aircraft also, and
for not securing consideration of Japan's
"special geographic position" in the al
lotment of armament. General satisfac
tion is felt with the results of the con
ference, both among the people and in
commercial circles.
BUT IRELAND
News from Ireland, where the nego
tiations between Sir James Craig, Pre
mier of the Northern Parliament, and
Michael Collins, President of the Irish
Free State, were broken off recently,
after the two had tried to reach an agree
ment as to the new boundary between
the two sections of Ireland, indicates
that new disturbances have broken out.
An organized raid by Irish nationalists
resulted in the kidnapping of a number
of Ulster special constables. It is
thought that the raiders were members
of the Irish republican army. President
Collins, while assuring the British gov
ernment that he had already taken steps
to secure the release of the kidnapped
men, asked pointedly, "What else can
you expect?" Ulster has applied to Eng
land for military protection, and Lloyd
George has promised that a force of
British regulars will guard the border.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU EXPECT?
When Collins said "What else can you
expect?" he referred to the intransigeant
attitude of Ulster. But his remark has
a far wider application. For generations
Irishmen have been trained in opposition
to government; disregard of law has
been a civic virtue. It will not now be
easy to develop among them the respect
1 for law and desire for order so necessary
to the prosperity of the Free State. The
fault is still England's, for it was her
policy that gave Ireland such subversive
training in government; it will therefore
sit well with England to be patient and
sympathetic with her nyw little sister
| state.

Michael Collins, President of the Irish
Free State, were broken off recently,
after the two had tried to reach an agree
ment as to the new boundary between
the two sections of Ireland, indicates
that new disturbances have broken out.
An organized raid by Irish nationalists
resulted in the kidnapping of a number
of Ulster special constables. It is
thought that the raiders were members
of the Irish republican army. President
Collins, while assuring the British gov
ernment that he had already taken steps
to secure the release of the kidnapped
men, asked pointedly, "What else can
you expect?" Ulster has applied to Eng
land for military protection, and Lloyd
George has promised that a force of
British regulars will guard the border.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU EXPECT?
When Collins said "What else can you
expect?" he referred to the intransigeant
attitude of Ulster. But his remark has
a far wider application. For generations
Irishmen have been trained in opposition
to government; disregard of law has
been a civic virtue. It will not now be
easy to develop among them the respect
1 for law and desire for order so necessary
to the prosperity of the Free State. The
fault is still England's, for it was her
policy that gave Ireland such subversive
training in government; it will therefore
sit well with England to be patient and
sympathetic with her nyw little sister
| state.

THE TEN-YEAR HOLIDAY BEGINS
The United States suspends work to
day on 14 big war vessels—B battleships
and 6 battle cruisers. The saving will
be approximately $5,000,000 a month. If
the live-power pact on the limitation of
naval armaments is ratified, only three
of these ships will be used as war ves
sels. The Colorado, already 90 per cent
completed, will be retained, and two of
the battle cruisers will be converted into
airplane carriers. Japan has also
stopped work on the eight ships building
in her yards, and will turn the labor
hitherto used on the big ships to the
construction of auxiliary craft. The
official close of the Washington confer
ence was announced in the Japanese Diet
during a debate in which the Japanese
government was being criticised for not
securing a limitation of aircraft also, and
for not securing consideration of Japan's
"special geographic position" in the al
lotment of armament. General satisfac
tion is felt with the results of the con
ference, both among the people and in
commercial circles.
