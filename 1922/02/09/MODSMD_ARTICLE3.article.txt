# MID-YEAR ELECTION DRAWS HEAVY VOTE
## Phil Neer Elected to Athletic Board; Men's Council Not Chosen 
### 
There were many dark horses in the
mid-year quad election yesterday. Phil
Neer, running for the Board of Athletic
Control on what looked like a white bal
lot, experienced some difficulty in elim
inating his unexpected opponent. When
the ballots had been counted it seemed
that the name of one Dud DeGroot had
crept in, or rather been written into some
190 ballots. Neer, however, received
208 votes on the final count in spite of
the write-in.
i lie real dark horses appeared in the
races for the class offices. The sopho
mores, who turned out in such numbers
that the election officials failed to furnish
enough ballots for them, seemed unable
to agree upon a candidate for either vice
president or treasurer. A meager nine
teen candidates received votes for the
former office, and but seventeen pros"
pective treasurers appeared on the bal
lots. Each of these had his own group
of supporters. Ihe candidate from the
house where there were the most sopho
mores received the plurality. The stock
of candidates soon became exhausted,
though, and the other two officers were
elected without opposition. "Nip" Mc-
Hose was elected president, and Jack
Badham secretary on a white ballot.
Owing to the misunderstanding on the
part of the election board of the amend
ment passed last spring concerning elec
tion to the Men's Council, the vacancies
on this body were not filled. The amend
ment, which affected the standing of the
members on the Council, was officially
passed by the students but failed to ap
pear in the Daily Palo Alto the required
number of times, and for this reason
was unconstitutional. This fact was not
known to the election board.
Bob Titus was elected sophomore rep
resentative on the Executive Committee
over his opponent. Bob Nourse, by a
substantial majority. Titus received 275
votes to Nourse s 178. Grace Brown won
a closely contested race for junior
woman representative from Dorothy
Sudden, winning finally by a vote of 224
to 201. No junior man was elected to
the committee. Phil Landis. with 208
votes, received a plurality, but not the
required majority. Lefty Rogers, who
received 199 votes, will be Landis' op
ponent for the office at a special election
soon.
The junior class failed to bring forth
any dark horses in the race for its offi
cers. and the four candidates were elect
ed without bloodshed. James Ross was
chosen president. Pearl Bundick vice
