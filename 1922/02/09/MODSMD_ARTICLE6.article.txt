Wind and rain locked horns for a 1 >ijjj
I battle yesterday evening, and as time
' progressed it was apparent that the rain
! had all the hest of it. The game was
! not called on account of darkness, for
I at midnight water was flowing off the
I quad in itsrh great quantities that several
j people called off proposed trips to
j Niagara Falls.
The streets of Palo Alto were flooded
j late last night, and people with low cel
j lars had something to worry about. The
i rain was in the nature of a cloudburst
! which drenched everything in its path.
The highway near San Francisco was im
passable for a shoft time yesterday at
the height of the storm. Man-sized hail
hit the campus this morning.
Indications are that the weather will
not be much wetter if the precipitation
docs not increase.
