Selections representing periods of
music from classics by Schumann, Cho
pin. and Schubert, to numbers by such
modern composers as Frederick Keel and
Geoffrey O'Hara, are included in the
program which Reginald Werrenrath,
American baritone, will present in the
Assembly Hall this evening at 8:15. This
concert Vill lie the concluding event of
the Peninsula Musical Association series
for this year.
J he popularity of Mr. Werrenrath has
been a thing of gradual growth, and it
is generally agreed that his own per
formance has been his most effective ad
vertisement. Although critics give the
highest praise to his splendid voice and
artistic achievement, perhaps the great
est secret of his popularity with Ameri
can audiences is because of a winning,
healthy, sane personality. A New York
writer says of him: "The fact that he is
an artist, and a very sincere artist, does
not prevent him from seeing the outside
world as other ssee it. He shows that
I
art and normality arc not antagonistic."
Werrenrath will be accompanied at the
piano by Harry Spier, who in addition to
the accompaniments, will play two piano
solos. The entire program to be pre
