# BASKETBALL TEAM TO BATTLE SAINTS TOMORROW NIGHT
## Oakland Aggregation Held to Be Strong Scoring Machine, Cardinal Team in "Trim" WERRENRATH CONCERT CLOSES SERIES HERE 
### 
Gone \ an Gent's basketball squad will
top off a strenuous week by playing host
to the Phoenix live from St. Mary's to
morrow evening at the pavilion. The
usual double bill of basketball entertain
ment will be provided, with the varsity
game starting at 8:15.
When the "powers that be" drew up
the Stanford schedule this fall, they fig
ured that the Oaklanders would not
prove extra difficult for the Cardinal
tossers to beat. The Saints* have crossed
them up, however, for they are a credit
able aggregation of basket shooters.
Any team that begins with "Saint" is
liable to prove a. bugbear for the Stan
ford varsity, for basketball fans haven't
yet forgotten what the supposedly weak
St. Ignatius live did to the varsity. If
the St. Mary's lands can upset the dope
as much as the Ignatians did, Van Gent's
charges are going to have their hands
full keeping them properly subdued.
Despite the fact that the Cardinals
have played three games since last Satur
day night, they are in better shape than
at any time since the start of the season.
Van Gent isn't handicapped by lack of
forwards, for he has Davies, McHose,
and Rogers in the fold. Janssen leaves
little to be desired at center. For the
running guard position, there is Rich
mond, who apparently has recovered
from his recent illness, Anderson, and
Pitts. DeGroot is fast learning all the
tricks of the trade of the standing guard
job.
If the Stanford attack can show the
accuracy in shooting goals that was pres
ent in the two opening games of the sea
son, St. Mary's should be defeated with
ease. It might have been a different story
in the California and Washington State
contests had Janssen, McHose, and
Davies been successful in some of the
many tries they had at the basket.
At least three of the Livermore Cow
boy five of last year are now accounted
for. Two of them, Vakota and Mc-
Glinchey, have been staring for the Santa
Clara Missions this season. The third
one cast his lot with St. Mary's. His
name is Grana and his specialty is keep
ing the opposing forwards out of St.
Mary's territory. Tt will be interesting
to see what happens when he runs up
against Davies and McHose.
St. Mary's put a damper on any aspira
tions the University of Nevada may have
possibly because it immediately followed
tbe fervent and religious "Blind Plavv
man." He chose for his concluding num
ber Kipling's "On the Road to Manda
lay," which revealed the rich qualities of
his voice, and which he interpreted in a
decidedly original manner, speaking
rather than singing some of the lines.
The same was true of the conversational
parts in "Danny Deever," which he gave
as an encore. Encores were demanded
after every group, those especially ef
fective being "Drink to Me Only With
Thine Eyes" and "A Khaki Lad," by
Florence Heywood.
Harry Spier at the piano displayed ad
mirable technique both in his accompani
ments and in his two solos, a Chopin noc
turne and Rachmaninoff's "Prelude in G
Minor."
