# FRESHMEN TO PLAY SAINT MARY'S HIGH SCHOOL TOMORROW
## 
### 
St. Mary's High School and the Fresh
man basketball team will play tomorrow
night at 7:15 in the pavilion as a prelim
inary to the varsity game.
The Freshmen should experience little
difficulty in adding the Saints to their
list of defeated teams, as the High School
team is light and has not had a success
ful season. Their forwards have made a
reputation, however, as accurate shots. '
It will be a weakened team that faces
the High School five. Both Hooper, star
running guard, and Hoffman, who has
played the best game at forward that has
been seen on the court this season, arc
definitely out of the running tonight.
Hoffman has an injured knee that will
keep him out of the game with California
Freshmen on the seventeenth. Hooper
has had a cold and lias not been in uni
form for three days.
Coach Seay will probably start Alex
ander and Priscoll. forwards, Steele,
center, and Shipke and Oliva, guards.
