# DELTA KAPPA EPSILON HOUSE BADLY DAMAGED BY FIRE THIS MORNING
## High Wind Aids Fire in Gutting Third Floor of Fraternity House; Damage is as Yet Undetermined 
### 
Flames, starting from an unknown source, gutted the top story of the
Delta Kappa Epsilon house, early this morning, and threatened to destroy the
whole structure. Fanned by the gale which was reaching its height in vio
lence at the time the tire br#ke out, the blaze mounted spectacularly, show
ering sparks on the Kappa Alpha house and lighting up the vicinity up and
down the Row. The arrival of the new fire-fighting equipment, installed oil
the campus but a short time ago, won the battle after a hard struggle. The
damage done has not been estimated, but the whole roof and top story were
destroyed.
The fire started about 2:30 in the morning. A heavy wind was blowing,
and the flames gained headway fast. The fire-fighting equipment responded
promptly to the call, but for a while after its arrival was helpless against the
mounting blaze. Trunks, desks, bureaus, books and smaller articles came
sliding and bumping down the stairways and sailing out of the windows as

those inside made a desperate at
tempt to save everything movable
from what looked like certain destruc
tion. Soon the front lawn looked like
the last day of an auction sale, with a
big crowd around, but no bidders.
The wind was blowing toward the
Kappa Alpha. House, and the flames,
starting from the middle of the roof,
swept that way with rapidity. They
also crept slowly back along the ridge
pole in the face of the blaze, until
only fragments of the rafters remain
ed, forming the skeleton of the top
story, strung along loosely from the
chimney. Within fifteen minutes from
the time the first spark flew, the con
flagration had reached its height and
the crackling of the burning-wood was
added to the roaring of the wind and
flames.
The danger point was passed when
the fire-fighters were able to pass the
hose inside the house and attack the
heart of the flame at short range. The
fire was soon completely extinguished.
A drizzling rain fell throughout the
whole time, but its effect was nulli
fied by the southeast gale that was
driving it along. How the fire started
is unknown. The theory of crossed
electric wires is partially contradicted
by the fact that lights in the first and
second stories burned brightly while
the fire was at its maximum. The
house is untenantable/until after the
rain, when"a nuvrToof \vill be put on.
