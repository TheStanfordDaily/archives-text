# SPANISH ORGANISTS TO FEATURE RECITAL
## 
### 
At the organ recital Sunday afternoon,
February 12, at 4 o'clock, Warren D.
Allen, university organist, will play,
among his other numbers, three compo
sitions which are typical of the best work
by modern Spanish organists.
He will also play "Told at Sunset"
(from the "Woodland Sketches") by Ed
ward MacDowell, the well known Ameri
can composer. This selection, which has
a delicacy and a richness of feeling, is
one of the most appealing of his sketches.
The following numbers will comprise
the program:
Fugue in E Flat Bach
Told at Sunset (from the "Woodland
Sketches") Edward MacDowell
Plegaria (Prayer) Louis Urteaga
Elevacion Jose Antonio de Erauzquin
Final Jose Maria Beobide
