# An Object Lesson

### 
Only the workmanlike efforts of the tire depart
ment, under the direction of Fire Inspector Lamb,
prevented the total destruction of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon House. The fire, which resulted from un
known causes, burned the entire second story of the
dwelling, ruining the personal effects of the persons
living in it, and the storm which followed the fire
finished the work that was left undone by the flames.
It is believed that the fire resulted from one of
two causes; faulty wiring or a defective flue. Prac
tically thirty men have lost their personal properties
or had them so badly damaged by fire and water that
they are worthless. All of these men are homeless
for the time being, and will have to appeal to their
friends for shelter during the time necessary for re
building. The loss of their books and notes, and the
necessity for becoming settled again, at this time,
when mid-quarter examinations are being held, may
result in the disqualification of several of the men.
1 here is an object lesson in this disaster for every
living group on the campus. A report of the lire
inspector, published in these columns a few weeks
Ago, showed that practically every house on the cam
pus that quarters men or women is a poor fire risk.
Not only are most of the living quarters built of wood
and are now very old, but rubbish and papers, which
would heighten the ferocity of any fire that might
start, have been allowed to collect in basements and
.storerooms on the lower floors.
As the fire inspector pointed out, "An ounce of
fire prevention is worth several thousand gallons of
water and chemicals, and oftentimes saves many lives
and much personal and real property."
It is unpleasant to think of what might have hap
pened if this fire had occurred during autumn when
everything is dry and a slight Wind might have car
ried the flames to neighboring dwellings.
