# VARSITY-ALUMNI GAME WILL NOT BE PLAYED
## 
### 
Due to the heavy rains recently, the
baseball game between the varsity and
the alumni team, scheduled for tomorrow
afternoon, has been called off, for the
present, and will not be played unless
weather conditions make a complete re
versal of form. This was to have been
the first game of the season, but the ini
tial contest will prt»bably take place
toward the middle of next week.
This is the second called off dur
ing this week, as Ireland's Independents
were to have played the alumni yester
day. However, campus fans will have
plenty of opportunity to see Cliff Ireland
and his cohorts in action, as «they arc
scheduled for three games with the var
sity this season. Cliff will bring his men
down on the 22d of this month to play
Seay's tossers.
Outdoor practice for the varsity has
been abandoned the last two days be
cause of the condition of the field. The
men have been taking workouts in the
gym to keep in shape, and with the re
turn of good weather and a dry field,
active work will be resumed.
