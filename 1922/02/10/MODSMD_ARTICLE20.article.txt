# The 						Vocational Conference
## 
### 
An event of worth-while value to all women in the
University is the Fifth Annual Vocational Confer
ence which will be held for them on next Saturday
morning. To know where we are going is absolutely
necessary in getting there, and the purpose- of the
'conference is thus two-fold, in that it suggests prac
tical roads of endeavor to those who are as yet unde
cided as to what kind of activity to pursue and also
stimulates and encourages the interest of those who
have already decided upon a specific vocation.
The Conference brings together speakers who know
■ through actual experience the careers now* open to
collcge women, and the program has been arranged
•to present a well-balanced ensemble of the newest
and most desirable fields which the college-trained
woman may now enter.
The information gained will assuredly prove useful
either immediately or at some future time. The
speakers and their topics selected for Saturday's pro
gram, which emphasize the point of view the profes
sional woman must have, as well as outlining the busi
ness opportunities now open to her along all repre
sentative lines, are of interest to all women in the
University. This is especially true as regards new
women, who are not yet familiar with the value of
the annual conferences and who have before them
the necessity of choosing the life interst to which
their collcge training forms a preface.
