We lead off with the remark that it is impossible to
get a shave without getting a hair cut.

NOW THAT idea of renaming college teams is not a
bad one. For example, Washington State has been call
ed the "Huskies," Stanford has been called the "Cardi
nals," and California has been called —well, they've been
called so often we just can't remember.

People we could do without: The bird that sits right
behind you and tells you how the game shoulda been
played; the bird that leaves his cigarette lying carelss
like on the edge of the chair.

They all do it.
When she was yet a little kid,
She mimiked what her elders did,
She often wore her mamma's hats,
Combined with daddy's pearl-gray spats.
And every thing went well enough,
, Until she found ma's powder-puff.
With youthful pride she learned its ways.
And then, throughout the coming da\s.
She got the habit, firm and strong,
It's clung with her this whole life long.
She's never ready when it's time.
For she's afraid her nose will shine.
In traffic whirl, or concert hall,
There's one thing she does first of all,
NO MATTER where or why she goes,
She needs must powder-puff her nose.

They say pigs don't grow in trees. How should we
know? But ten forks were no more good to us than
two straws are to a spelling champion drinking alphabet
soup.
Ain't 't the truth?
Crowding, crushing, clamoring, the surging sea of
humanity swished to the proud portals of .the pathless
palace. Then the referee blew his whistle. He bowed.
"My friends," he said, standing in a knee-deep silence,
'nowisthetimeforallgoodmentocometotheaidoftheirparty.'
He thereupon shot the ticket taker from mid-court.
A low murmur ran through the crowd and got the best
seat. ,
Then they woke up. Flattening a heroic five-man
defense, they rushed through the door. They cheered
| him to the echo, and back again. Rending the air. a
skyrocket raised the roof.
Thus exposed, the game had to be postponed on ac
count of rain.
* * *
We try to be fair. Equality of man, and all that stuff.
But our patience has bust. S'too much. When we asked
a fellow victim for the low-down on the required read
ing, what the heck did he say but "Yeah—read it —just
like a novel."

Cabbages notes with horror the challenge sent by the
superintendent of schools in Chico, to the worfd at large,
for a marble game, to be played in a nirir-foot ring

Article in I). P. A. on game between President of
local institution and president of local, 935, Marble
Shooters of Palo Alto.
President of Stanford University met. and de
feated the president of Marble Shooters' local, in
a fast marble game last night, in Stanford's new
marble pavilion. The usual rule of three fingers
flat, no fudging, and lagging, were in operation.
Neither opponent seriously injured, although the
president of the P. A. M. S. broke an agate during
a particularly violent shot.

She mimiked what her elders did,
She often wore her mamma's hats,
Combined with daddy's pearl-gray spats.
And every thing went well enough,

With youthful pride she learned its ways.
And then, throughout the coming da\s.

Article in I). P. A. on game between President of
local institution and president of local, 935, Marble
Shooters of Palo Alto.
President of Stanford University met. and de
feated the president of Marble Shooters' local, in
a fast marble game last night, in Stanford's new
marble pavilion. The usual rule of three fingers
flat, no fudging, and lagging, were in operation.
Neither opponent seriously injured, although the
president of the P. A. M. S. broke an agate during
a particularly violent shot.

not.)

outside the door of house. (!) $$]| @ *?? !!! (at least
four times). Dash across street, met half-way by 120
pounds per square inch from new fire engine hose.

NOW THAT idea of renaming college teams is not a

They all do it.
When she was yet a little kid,
She mimiked what her elders did,
She often wore her mamma's hats,
Combined with daddy's pearl-gray spats.
And every thing went well enough,
, Until she found ma's powder-puff.
With youthful pride she learned its ways.
And then, throughout the coming da\s.
She got the habit, firm and strong,
It's clung with her this whole life long.
She's never ready when it's time.
For she's afraid her nose will shine.
In traffic whirl, or concert hall,
There's one thing she does first of all,
NO MATTER where or why she goes,
She needs must powder-puff her nose.

They say pigs don't grow in trees. How should we

two straws are to a spelling champion drinking alphabet
soup.
Ain't 't the truth?
Crowding, crushing, clamoring, the surging sea of
humanity swished to the proud portals of .the pathless
palace. Then the referee blew his whistle. He bowed.
"My friends," he said, standing in a knee-deep silence,
'nowisthetimeforallgoodmentocometotheaidoftheirparty.'
He thereupon shot the ticket taker from mid-court.
A low murmur ran through the crowd and got the best
seat. ,
Then they woke up. Flattening a heroic five-man
defense, they rushed through the door. They cheered
| him to the echo, and back again. Rending the air. a
skyrocket raised the roof.
Thus exposed, the game had to be postponed on ac
count of rain.
