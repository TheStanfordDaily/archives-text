# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## IRELAND STILL IN TROUBLE 
### 
As a result of yesterday's kidnapping
raids, in which Irish nationalists spirited
away two hundred unionists, the Ulster
border is being heavily guarded. Ulster
has appealed to England for aid. Mean
while the Irish Free State bill, designed
to put into effect the provisions of the
treaty, has been introduced in Parlia
ment.
De Valera has begun a campaign
against the treaty, and wants to appeal
to the people for a plebiscite. He has
asked the Irish in America for funds
with which to carry on a campaign, and
has organized a demonstration to be
held next Sunday in favor of the re
public.
HOOVER AND THE SOVIET R C
Herbert Hoover created a sensation by
announcing yesterday that the Russian
Red Cross, which has been raising money
for the relief of the famine sufferers, is
not so much a branch of the Interna
tional Red Cross as a department of the
soviet government. Department of Jus
tice officials are now investigating the re
lationship between this relief agency and
the soviet government.
FORD'S NITRATE PROJECT
Ford's plan to. complete the govern
ment nitrate plant at Mussel Shoals is
under discussion at Washington. The
Mussel Shoals project has a double pur
poseâ€”to provide cheap fertilizer for the
worn-out lands of the South, and to se
cure a source of supply for nitrates, to
be used for explosives in time of war.
