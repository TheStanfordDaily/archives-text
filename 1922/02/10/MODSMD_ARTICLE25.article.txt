# BASEBALL FIGHT RULES URGED BY QUADRANGLE CLUB
## 
### 
Regulation of the baseball fight, so as
to limit the time to half an hour and
confine the action to the baseball field,
was advocated by the Quadrangle Club
in a resolution passed last night, which
will be placed before the Executive Com
mittee for consideration. The motion
passed was "that the baseball fight be
kept as an institution but be placed under
permanent regulations, these regulations
to consist in limiting the fight to a period
of half an hour or less, under upperclass
or block S men's supervision, that the
fight be confined to the baseball field, thus
eliminating all kidnaping, all relays and
all preliminary skirmishes; that the ball
be delivered to the baseball captain at the
end of the period designated, the class
delivering the ball at this time to be
winner of the fight."
PJans for the Irish marathon and the
annual holdover show staged by the
club were brought up in the meeting last
night.
