# CIRCLE "S" MEETS AT KAPPA SIGMA HOUSE
## 
### 
Plans were formulated for a com
bination show and dance to be given
during the Spring quarter, at a dinner
meeting of Circle "S" Society, at the
Kappa Sigma house, last night. Wear
ers of the circle "S" were urged to
wear their sweaters on Wednesdays
and Saturdays, and it was decided to
recommend to the Executive Commit
tee that a Circle "S" card, like that
from Block "S" wearers, be given
men owning a circle "S", which would
admit to minor sport games.
Entertainment of visiting teams,
not only of Stanford's competitors, but
also of those passing through, was
commended, and assistance in this di
rection was pledged.
The meeting will be at the Delta
Upsilon house, about the first of next
month.
