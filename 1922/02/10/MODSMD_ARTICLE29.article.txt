have been spent in choosing a various and
colorful display especially in those cos
tumes worn by the "beauty chorus." In
the last song alone there are four differ
ent types of adornment represented
among the eight "beauties" in this galaxy
of dancers.
The first act contains six of the song
numbers, and it is during this,.time that
the plot of the performance is brought
out. "Candlelight" is one (if the songs
that acords an opportunity for lighting
effects, althought it also helps bring
dcnvn the total cost of electricity used.
As for the entra-act, Edgar Allan Poe,
if he were alive, would undoubtedly like
to see it. He would have gained some
potverful inspirations.
Grand opera a la mode, containing bits
of the very best music from the time (if
the Ark down to the present, arranged by
Midgley, is interpolated in the second act
for the amusement of the king and the
liberal education of the audience.
Further on in the same scene, "The
Scandal Man," a song and dance number
featuring Sam Mendenhall in his third
dance of the evening, gives rise to a
series of whispers and expressions of
curiosity on the faces of the chorus.
"The Cubist Blues," as sung by Nelson
Valjean and Jordan Ownby, explains the
kind of blues that come from too much
time spent with the cubes, especially if
sevens are scarce on the first shot, or if
it's "noon" too often.
National art connoisseurs would do
well to attend the show if they want to
pick up something different in the line
of paintings, for every now and then the
hero-artist displays some masterpieces
that should make would-be artists gasp
with surprise. Originality is a weak
word to use in describing the style of
these canvas achievements.
The show itself is not the only original
thing. The business management has
announced definitely that roughs who try
to see any part of the show free are now
told in advance, to soften the shock, that
they are doomed to disappointment.
The curtain is due to rise at S: 15.
