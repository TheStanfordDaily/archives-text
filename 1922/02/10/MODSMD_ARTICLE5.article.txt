# Werrenrath Gives Effective Program in Last of Series
## VARSITY WILL MEET ST. MARY'S PLAYERS 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
An unusually intriguing program, com
prehensive and carefully arranged, and
sung by a truly gifted artist—Reinald
Werrenrath—last evening brought to a
notable close the Peninsula Musical As
sociation's series of concerts for thfs year.
Certainly no more impressive numbers
could have been given, and no finer artist
could have been chosen to interpret them.
Such a recital as that given by Werren
rath can leave only a feeling of highest
satisfaction and enjoyment, the only
shadow being regret at its ending.
In Giordani's "Caro Mio Ben," Wer
renrath commanded immediate interest at
the beginning of the program, introduc
ing to his audience a land of fancy and
vocal perfection, an effect which his vari
ous selections and individual artistry
combined to carry out. For all the num
bers appealed directly to the imagination,

and were sung with a delightfully dra
matic touch. Added to this was the
beauty of the singer's voice, which is
characterized by a finish that at once in
terests and satisfies, and by an unusual
range.
Wcrrenrath makes his audience visual
ize every song. He at once inspires con
fidence, and sings with an entirely un
affected ease ; bis diction is so clear that
even without the innovation of the words
being reproduced on the programs, not a
word could have been missed.
Among other songs of the first group
an old Irish piece, "Over the Hills and
Far Away," whimsically suggestive of
the land of Banshees, an Italian number,
"Che Fiero Costume" and an old English
ballad, "The Pretty Creature," were ap
pealing in melody and in the imaginative
atmosphere they created. More re
strained and dignified, but none the less
dramatic, were two German numbers by
Schubert, one by Schumann, and Sind
ing's "Licht" which followed.
One of the most effective numbers was
Massenet's "Vision Fugitive," a brilliant
selection in French, which was followed
by Masefield's three "Salt Water Bal
lads" by Frederick Keel, into which Wer
renrath put the whole force of his per
sonality.
Wcrrenrath did not at first seem to
enter into the spirit of the French dialect
poem, "The Wreck of the Julie Plainte,"
