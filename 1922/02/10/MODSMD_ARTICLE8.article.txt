Swung from its horizontal position by
the force of the gale that swept the cam
pus yesterday morning, the fiag pole at
the post-office, a landmark which has
endured for many years, made a volun
tary surrender yesterday afternoon and
was hauled down by a gang of workmen.
The pole had been tipped over so far that
it was deemed unsafe to leave it standing
at that angle.
Other effects of the windstorm were
noticeable about the campus. The track
house at the beginning of the 220 stretch
was blown clear off the rollers on which
it was standing, and it is now lying on its
side at the end of the straightaway.
Signs were blown over and a few trees
damaged by limbs splitting under the
power of the wind.
A cloudburst early this morning which
continued with force made a veritable
lake of the entire campus.
