# HALL MAKES PLEA FOR HAPPY ENDING
## Noted Short Story Writer Is Speaker at Meeting of the Journalists' Association 
### 
"I base my plea for the happy ending
in modern fiction, partly, on the grounds
that since this old world is so full of
woe at its very hest, the man who has
some creative ability owes it to other
people to lighten life up a hit," said Wil
bur Hall in his talk to the American
Journalists' Association and others last
night at the Alpha Sigma Phi house. Hall
is a regular contributor of short stories
to the Saturday Evening Post and is now
writing feature stories for the San Fran
cisco Chronicle.
''Life is a hard, tedious, desperate game
and most people are unhappy part of the
time." On this account. Hall believes
that writers should make things sound
more pleasant. "1 don't like the saccha
rine kind of story," he warned, "in which
the characters are very good throughout
and come out at the end just as sweet as
when they started.
"There isn't anybody who doesn't have
happy endings in his life," said Hall in
giving another basis for his theory. "The
story that ends with one is just as true
to life as the story that leaves its charac
ters in a miserable situation. The people
who finish their work in a disappointing
manner, write as they see it, about the
truth of life that is bad and leave out the
good.
"J think the reason why quite young
people usually write such dull, sordid
pictures of life is that they are used to
having things run along smoothly and
the tragic happenings strike them with
greater force. They see the tragic things
more clearly than older people who are
used to them and look for the brighter
side of life."
His advice to the young writer who is
trying to get recognition is to learn the
most disagreeable and hardest subjects
first. He pointed out the analogous fact
that musicians have to work on tedious
exercises before they can sit down and
play a Beethoven sonata.
"Most of the critics object to happy
endings. I think that the people who
leave stories with indeterminate, unsatis
fying endings are too lazy to work out a
climatic plot. Of course, the literary
value of the happy ending is merely a
