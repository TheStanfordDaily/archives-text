# ARTISTIC, COMIC CLEVERLY USED BY RAM'S HEAD
## High Standards Attained By Ram's Head Society Musical Burlesque Friday evening 
### Kenneth N. Stewart, '23 
Well, I'll be damned!
A masterful combination of the artistic
and the ridiculous left that impression
with the audience when the curtain was
rung down upon the colorful and spec
tacular finale of the Ram's Head Society
presentation of its 1922 musical burlesque,
"Koo-Koo-Ktibistown," in the Assembly
Hall Friday evening.
As Wilbur Hall said after the perform
ance, "It was a perfectly sincere and de
lightfully successful effort to give a few
hours of clean and amusing entertain
ment and lagged only when actors, au
thors and technicians were a bit too so
phisticated—a bit too ambitious."
"Koo-Koo-Kubistown" was conven
tionally unconventional. It used many of
the generally accepted means of produc
ing the "entirely different" cffect—but it
used them cleverly and skilfully.
Music, effects, and characters are the
three outstanding elements of the ex
travaganza. Plot is always negligible in
such a production, but "Koo-Koo-Kubis
town" came nearer to having a plot than
anything presented by Ram's Head in
recent years. The authors, Tom Cars
kadon, Tom Irwin and Dan Evans, de
voted most of their efforts toward laugh
able lines and situations.
For some time to come the campus will
be humming the intriguing tunes of the
musical program, which was under the
direction of Myron Higby. Malaby,
Midgley, Carey, Scwall, Burgess, How
ard, and Higby were the composers. In
dividual taste must decide which airs
were the hits of the evening.
Hearty laughter greeted Nelson Val
jean when lie started the action of the
play following an effective opening
chorus and the laughter continued as he
enhanced good blackface comedy lines
with an agility of movement and expres
sion. The authors sighed with relief
when he saved the situation* after the
lines had become tangled in the closing
scene. Humedor was supported, literally
and figuratively, by the bulky Taffeta
(Jordan Ownby), whose soft-shoe dance
was an entertaining feature of their song
number, "Cubist Blues."
Paul Clafiin's "fashal expression was
wanderful," and although he had less
than his share of funny speeches, his
makeup and characterization of Bedelia
were hilariously amusing. Ned Prather
as the Countess Owt, and Arnold Bayley
as Purple Pearl completed the three
cornered female lead. Bayley's acting,
handicapped by unsightly costumes, was
finished, particularly in the second act.
where his stage presence and ease were
evident. Prather was attractive and
graceful and his previous experience in
similar roles was obvious. Both men
have good stage voices for such parts and
their songs were artfully done. ,
George Uhl was distinctly feminine in
voice and manner, and to the audience he
was none other than Jazabel Jazz, the
princess of Jazzonia.
Hollis Chalmers' acting is always ad
mirable, and Friday night was no excep
tion. Bill Shiels' Irish brogue was con
sistently good, and he appeared as much
at ease as though he were not perform
ing before a filled auditorium.
The authors did not ask much of Dick
Pershing in the leading role of Whitmore
Whistler, and his real opportunities came
when he sang. Pershing's dramatics have
improved since last year.
John Sansone was the most blood
thirsty of bloodthirties and with his vil
lainous henchmen, Elmer Collette, David
Mannoccir, and Russell Merritt. con
ducted himself in a truly murderous man
ner.
The beauty of the ladies' chorus
equalled (and perhaps surpassed) that of
a Junior Opera. The intricacy, grace,
and perfection of their steps served, as
did the other qualities of the production,
to prove that Stanford has a craftsman
in Coach Lester Seib. It is unfair to pick
any one or two from the chorus for
praise, but Mike Hodges, James Muir,
and Everett Swing were so exceptionally
attractive that they are still being talked
about.
Sam MendenhalPs feature dances were
weird, grotesque, and skillful.
Particularly beautiful and artistic
scenic effects were achieved in "Candle
light" and the "Hongkong Wedding
Day," the first prettily simple and the
second elaborately spectacular. The
"Scandal Man" number and the "Crndle
of Murder"' scene were ingeniously
worked out, the former being the most
professional part of the show.
"The Fearless Quartet," composed of
Bing Shaw, Jerry Powell. Howard Wil
son, and Reed Nesbit, combined pleasing
harmony with mirth-provoking "grand
opera" selections. They were heartily
encored.
The cubistic sets and the lights which
were played upon them defy description.
Few could have accomplished what Fred
Fisher and Clyde Coakley did with colors
and a fertile imgaination.
If the play was long, the audience made
it so by repeated demands for returns,
evidencing a whole-hearted approval.
