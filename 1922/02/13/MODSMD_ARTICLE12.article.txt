# VAN GENT'S COURT FIVE DISPOSES OF ST. MARY'S
## Stanford Attack Pierces Weak Defense of Madigan's Quintet 
### GARRETT ELMORE, '23 
A rejuvenated Cardinal varsity quintet returned to the ranks of the winners
last Saturday night by trampling on "Flash" Madigan's outfit from St. Mary's,
26 to 13.
About 1000 spectators watched the Stanford basket-tossers, partially escaped
from the clutches of Old Joe Slump, dispatch the Phoenix live with ease. The
score at half stood 15 to 6 in favor of the varsity.
As a basketball game, it was nothing out of the ordinary. There were several
things, however, that served to liven the interest of the crowd.

First, the Stanford attack made its a
by any means, but for the first time in

ppiiarance. Jt was not its initial showing
the past two weeks the Cardinal sharp
shooters lived up to their name. Mc-
Hose, Davies, and Janssen picked off
baskets from all parts of the court.
Second, "Lefty" Rogers, in the short
time he was in the game, gave evidences
of having "arrived." The chunky for
ward caged a long one in the first two
minutes of play, and otherwise demon
strated that he is back in last years' form.
DsGroot Makes Goal
ihird, Dud DeGroot celebrated the oc
casion by making a goal, bringing his
point total for the season to four. That
assured the Cardinal victory. The stand
ing guard went forward to relieve Jans
sen ,and the ball came to him in front of
the St. Mary's basket. DeGroot let fly
and the ball wended its way into the
basket, bringing the half to a successful
close.
A moment before, Nip McHose, who
had succeeded Rogers early in the period,
had just finished a scoring stampede. The
fast forward put on a burst of speed and
made three field goals in rapid succes
sion, raising the Cardinal total from 7 to
13. St. Mary's six points resulted from
field goals by Grana and Silva and two
free throws by McNally.
Cardinal Has Strong Defense
Dick Richmond and DeGroot, assisted
by Janssen, ably cared for the St. Mary's
attack, such as it was. The Saints' efforts
were confined to a few long shots and
foul throws. Lester, reported to be the
best of Madigan's attack, did not do any
damage at all to the Stanford quintet.
The Saints' four field goals were divided
evenly between Grana, McNally, Odland,
and Silva.
Nip McHose thought lie was due to
tally most of Stanford's points, and he
went at it with a vengeance, scoring
twelve points in three-quarters of the
contest. Davies was not far behind with
eight. The Cardinal leader set a new
mark to shoot at in converting fouls, for
he tossed six goals out of six attempts.
Grana Stars for St. Marys
Joe Grana, formerly broncho-buster
with the Livermore Cowboys, did his best
to stave off defeat for St. Mary's, l>ut lie
could not turn the trick single-handed.
Grana opposed Davies, and the two
staged a good basketball duel with
honors about even, until little McHose
broke into the game. Grana couldn't
handle both Davies and McHose at the
same time, but he made the mistake of
trying to, so one or the other of the
Cardinal forwards frequently had a clear
field.
Second Half Closer
St. Mary's perked up in the second half
and stopped the Stanford walkaway.
With ten minutes to go, the score was 19
to 9. Janssen made his lone two points,
but McNally and Odland scored on long
shots, and the scoreboard read 21 to 1.3.
McHose dropped in his final goal just
before Rogers relieved him. Davies
gathered in his only goal from the field,
making the final count 26 to 13. The box
