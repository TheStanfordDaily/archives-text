## 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Coming up from behind in the last
five minutes of play, the Stanford
freshmen defeated the St. Mary's
freshmen, 25 to 22, in the Pavilion,
Saturday night.
The freshmen combined in one game
some of the poorest playing of the sea
son with some of the best teamwork
that they have yet shown. The small
guards of the St. Mary's team clung
to their larger opponents like leeches,
and this threw the forwards off their
balance.for the first half, as they have j
been able to score almost at will in
their last three games.
Many fouls were called on the babes
during the course of the game, but
St. Mary's forwards converted only
six out of the twelve into tallies.
In the first half, the freshmen as
sumed the lead in the first two min
utes of play, on a basket by Driseoll.
The St. Mary's freshmen then broke
loose, and by a series of long shots
by Murdock, forward, and Grant,
guard, assumed an S to 13 lead over
the freshmen before half time. It
was during this first half that the
freshman attack, started by Driseoll,
fell to pieces and the Babes resorted |
largely to bewildered defensive play-'

Steele was the sensation of the first I
half. The fighting center was every-J
where at once, breaking up passes, in-!
tercopting shots, and in the meantime |
making one long-range basket from
side court.
After the rest period the freslimon
came back and demonstrated that I
Duffy Seay's coaching had not been in |
vain. A foul on Shipke added one
to St. Mary's score, and then the
babes began their drive that first tied
