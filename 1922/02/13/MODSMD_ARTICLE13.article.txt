# FINAL SPURT WINS FOR CARD FRESHMEN IN ST. MARY'S GAME
## 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Coming up from behind in the last
five minutes of play, the Stanford
freshmen defeated the St. Mary's
freshmen, 25 to 22, in the Pavilion,
Saturday night.
The freshmen combined in one game
some of the poorest playing of the sea
son with some of the best teamwork
that they have yet shown. The small
guards of the St. Mary's team clung
to their larger opponents like leeches,
and this threw the forwards off their
balance.for the first half, as they have j
been able to score almost at will in
their last three games.
Many fouls were called on the babes
during the course of the game, but
St. Mary's forwards converted only
six out of the twelve into tallies.
In the first half, the freshmen as
sumed the lead in the first two min
utes of play, on a basket by Driseoll.
The St. Mary's freshmen then broke
loose, and by a series of long shots
by Murdock, forward, and Grant,
guard, assumed an S to 13 lead over
the freshmen before half time. It
was during this first half that the
freshman attack, started by Driseoll,
fell to pieces and the Babes resorted |
largely to bewildered defensive play-'
ing.
Steele was the sensation of the first I
half. The fighting center was every-J
where at once, breaking up passes, in-!
tercopting shots, and in the meantime |
making one long-range basket from
side court.
After the rest period the freslimon
came back and demonstrated that I
Duffy Seay's coaching had not been in |
vain. A foul on Shipke added one
to St. Mary's score, and then the
babes began their drive that first tied
and then surpassed the best efforts of I
the Saints.
Fast and fairly accurate passing,
coupled with team-work such as the
first year men have never before dis- j
played, ran up the score to a 19 to
19 tie, with five minutes to play. A
foul by Alexander gave the Saints the
lead again, but Alexander retrieved j
himself by a speedy dribble and a j
fancy overhead shot. A technical foul j
by Shipke again tied the score. Alex-!
ander again broke the tie by a basket
from the side of the court, on a pass
from Steele.
A foul on Oliva gave the Saints an
other chance to win by bringing them
to within one point of the babes. In
the last minute of play came the best
bit of team-work that has been ex
hibited by any of the freshmen this
year. Shipke received the ball direct
ly in front of the basket. A shot was
possible Sjr him, but instead of shoot
ing he faked and drew the Saints'
guards toward him. A quick pass to
Driscoll, who had time to make a care
ful shot at the basket, and the game
was over.
Munlock was the outstanding player
of the St. Mary's line-up. His long
shots were responsible for the lead
that the Saints had at the end of the
first half. Grant, running guard,
showed marked ability in sticking to
his man, besides making two baskets.
Coach Duffy Seay was absent from
the bench during the game, and Hoop
er, who is out of the running on ac
count of a cold, handled the team for
the evening.
The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford —Alexander andj Driscoll.
forwards; Steele, center; Shipke and
Oliva, guards. Substitutes, none.
St. Mary's freshmen —Murdock and
Lorregan, forwards; McNamara, cen
ter; Grant and Allen guards.
