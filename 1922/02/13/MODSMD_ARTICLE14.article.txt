# SCHOLARSHIP TO BE REWARDED BY A.B. DISTINCTIONS
## Special Type of Degree to Be Granted For Excellence in All Undergraduate Work 
### 
Stanford University will hereafter of
ficially recognize and reward high schol
arship both during the undergraduate
course and in granting degrees. The
Uachelor of Arts degree will be awarded
this year and in succeeding years "with
great distinction" to about the upper
twentieth of the graduating class, and
"with distinction" to the next tenth in
point of scholarship record in the uni
versity. I lie remainder will receive, as
in the past, merely the A. B. indicating
the completion of the required four years
of satisfactory work.
Among the undergraduates about one
tenth of the students completing the
lower division work each year will be
awarded lower division honors for excel
lence during their first two years of col
lege work, and about thirty will be se
lected each spring from the students who
will be in the upper division the follow
ing year and designated "Stanford schol
ars."
Those who proposed these measures to
the faculty, which adopted them after
discussion, argued that excellence in
practically every enterprise in the uni
versity except scholarship is rewarded
with some visible token, and that the
university, when it takes notice of poor
scholarship through penalties extending
to expulsion, exhibits no corresponding
official recognition of superiority in the
chief activity of the students. It is hoped
that this definite rewarding of scholastic
excellence may help to emphasize the
merit of attainment in his field as well
as in athletics and other activities which
now win recognition.
The graduating honors will he noted
in all lists of the class and will appear on
the diplomas; the lower division honors
and the names of the Stanford scholars
