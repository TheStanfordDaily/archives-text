# SCHOLARSHIP TO BE REWARDED BY A.B. DISTINCTIONS
## Special Type of Degree to Be Granted For Excellence in All Undergraduate Work 
### 
Stanford University will hereafter of
ficially recognize and reward high schol
arship both during the undergraduate
course and in granting degrees. The
Uachelor of Arts degree will be awarded
this year and in succeeding years "with
great distinction" to about the upper
twentieth of the graduating class, and
"with distinction" to the next tenth in
point of scholarship record in the uni
versity. I lie remainder will receive, as
in the past, merely the A. B. indicating
the completion of the required four years
of satisfactory work.
Among the undergraduates about one
tenth of the students completing the
lower division work each year will be
awarded lower division honors for excel
lence during their first two years of col
lege work, and about thirty will be se
lected each spring from the students who
will be in the upper division the follow
ing year and designated "Stanford schol
ars."
Those who proposed these measures to
the faculty, which adopted them after
discussion, argued that excellence in
practically every enterprise in the uni
versity except scholarship is rewarded
with some visible token, and that the
university, when it takes notice of poor
scholarship through penalties extending
to expulsion, exhibits no corresponding
official recognition of superiority in the
chief activity of the students. It is hoped
that this definite rewarding of scholastic
excellence may help to emphasize the
merit of attainment in his field as well
as in athletics and other activities which
now win recognition.
The graduating honors will he noted
in all lists of the class and will appear on
the diplomas; the lower division honors
and the names of the Stanford scholars
will he printed in the commencement pro
gram each year and in the university
register and directory. Administration
of the regulations, nomination of those to
receive honor degrees, and the selection
of the recipients of lower division honors
and Stanford scholarships, have been
placed in the hands of the scholarship
committee of the faculty.
In order to secure an equitable dis
tribution of the honor degrees and Stan
ford scholarships, the faculty legislation
creating these distinctions provides that
they shall be distributed among the five
existing groups of departments approxi
mately according to the registration of
students in these departments. These
five groups --roughly, the de
partments concerned with languages, bio
logical sciences, physical sciences, social
sciences, and engineering.
The legislation adopted by the faculty
making these provisions is as follows:
"High scholastic attainment shall be
recognized by the university in the fol
lowing ways: (a) Upon completion of
the lower division, honors shall be
awarded to about the upper tenth of the
class, (h) About thirty Stanford schol
ars' shall be selected each spring quarter
from students who will be in the upper
division during the following year,
(c) The Bachelor of Arts degree shall
he awarded 'with distinction* to about
one-tenth of the graduating class, and
"with great distinction" to about one
twentieth, the two lists being exclusive
of each other. Stanford scholars, de
grees granted 'with distinction' and de
grees granted 'with great distinction,'
will be distributed among the five groups
of departments approximately according
to registration.
"The scholarship committee is au
thorized : (a) to adopt and alter de
tailed regulations for operating this plan,
(b) to select the persons receiving lower
division honors and to designate Stan
ford scholars, (c) to recommend to the
academic council, from the list of candi
dates for the bachelor's degree as pre
sented by the committee on graduation,
those persons who in the judgment of the
scholarship committee are entitled to de
grees 'with distinction' and 'with great
distinction.'"
