# Cheaper Shows?

Dramatic Coach Gordon Davis stated again a
long recognized truth in his recent article, "A New
University Theatre." in the February Pictorial.
Writing of the practice, lately abandoned, of paying
for every hour of work in the Assembly Hall by
student laborers, he said, "It does seem that this
plan, while efficient and self-supporting, is organized
along too highly commercial lines for a university
activity."
Davis draws a comparison between the new scheme
for making dramatics behind the scenes a real stu
dent activity, and campus journalism. He says, "The
students who go out for journalism, for example,
who delight in helping to make a newspaper, and who
wish to gain the valuable experience which it in
volves, do not receive any financial stipend for their
activity. However, certain students who assume
responsibility are recompensed for that responsibility
and for the accounting which they are required to
make of that trust."
The plan to put dramatic workers on the same
basis as campus journalists will be a line one indeed
if dramatics of the future will lie presented as cheaply
as the daily campus newspaper is furnished. Fifty
cents a quarter is the amount each student pays for
the Daily, and this cost barely covers the cost of the
print-paper, is it possible that the Dramatic Coun
cil has in mind such an innovation as a one-dollar
show ?
