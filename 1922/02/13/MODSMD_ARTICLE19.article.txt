# Building a Major Sport
## 
### 
"There is lots of water in tlie pool,' says Swim
ming Instructor Ernie Rrandsten, "and not many
swimmers to use it." Harking back to the old days
when the old swimming hole was the source of
every kid's delight, Rrandsten says that he does not
understand it. He bemoans the fact that very few
of the varsity swimmers are reporting for practice
and points to several facts about swimming at Stan
ford that are interesting.
Swimming is six years older at Stanford than at
any of the other coast colleges. Rapid strides have
been made by several of the conference universities
during the past year so that Stanford is now forced
to extend itself if it is to maintain the high place
it has held during the past six years. 1 he swim
ming coach looks forward to the time when swim
ming will be a major sport as it now is in several
of the larger universities of the east. Swimming
now receives the unqualified support of the Board
of Athletic Control and its recognition as a major
sport is a development that will follow upon the
recognition now being given it by Conference uni
versities.
Recause of previous successes in aquatics, the
Stanford varsity swimmers seem to have foregone
the sport and, believing that they have their places
secured, thcv are merely awaiting the time for the

southern trip, scheduled for the holidays. This has
prompted Brandsten to issue a call for more swim
mers among the three older classes. Competition
is a very necessary factor in team development and
it is one thing that the present swimming varsity
lacks.
There are several things that make swimming one
of the most attractive sports on the Stanford cal
endar. Stanford has better facilities for the conduct
of water sports than any college in the west. An
outdoor pool heated to a temperature of seventy-five
degrees has a marked advantage over an indoor
pool, which at this season is usually cold and
clammy, and the benefits of fresh air, even though
cold, outweigh those of used-over air to be found in
indoor swimming pools.
Those registered in swimming are permitted to
swim at any hour of the day from nine o'clock in
the morning to six o'clock, and the pool is open on
Sundays. It is not necessary to report at a special
hour just so the swimming is done sometime during
the day. This feature alone should appeal to the
ordinary student.
One feature of this activity that the swimming
instructor failed to mention is the benefit of expert
coaching. Brandsten goes about his business, that
of producing swimming and diviging teams, with
very little clamor and noise, and he does the work.
One world's champion swimmer and one world's
champion diver are two instances that illustrate the
fact that the Stanford swimming coach knows his
business. Further proof may be found in an ex
amination of the records made by Stanford teams
in all branches of aquatics.
Since it is more work that Brandsten craves, in
the form of more men to instruct, he should have it.
The terms as outlined are easy, and the men who
respond now are going to do a great deal toward
elevating swimming into the major sport class.

coaching. Brandsten goes about his business, that
of producing swimming and diviging teams, with
very little clamor and noise, and he does the work.
One world's champion swimmer and one world's
champion diver are two instances that illustrate the
fact that the Stanford swimming coach knows his
business. Further proof may be found in an ex
amination of the records made by Stanford teams
in all branches of aquatics.
Since it is more work that Brandsten craves, in
the form of more men to instruct, he should have it.
The terms as outlined are easy, and the men who
respond now are going to do a great deal toward
elevating swimming into the major sport class.
"There is lots of water in tlie pool,' says Swim
ming Instructor Ernie Rrandsten, "and not many
swimmers to use it." Harking back to the old days
when the old swimming hole was the source of
every kid's delight, Rrandsten says that he does not
understand it. He bemoans the fact that very few
of the varsity swimmers are reporting for practice
and points to several facts about swimming at Stan
ford that are interesting.
Swimming is six years older at Stanford than at
any of the other coast colleges. Rapid strides have
been made by several of the conference universities
during the past year so that Stanford is now forced
to extend itself if it is to maintain the high place
it has held during the past six years. 1 he swim
ming coach looks forward to the time when swim
ming will be a major sport as it now is in several
of the larger universities of the east. Swimming
now receives the unqualified support of the Board
of Athletic Control and its recognition as a major
sport is a development that will follow upon the
recognition now being given it by Conference uni
versities.
Recause of previous successes in aquatics, the
Stanford varsity swimmers seem to have foregone
the sport and, believing that they have their places
secured, thcv are merely awaiting the time for the

southern trip, scheduled for the holidays. This has
prompted Brandsten to issue a call for more swim
mers among the three older classes. Competition
is a very necessary factor in team development and
it is one thing that the present swimming varsity
lacks.
There are several things that make swimming one
of the most attractive sports on the Stanford cal
endar. Stanford has better facilities for the conduct
of water sports than any college in the west. An
outdoor pool heated to a temperature of seventy-five
degrees has a marked advantage over an indoor
pool, which at this season is usually cold and
clammy, and the benefits of fresh air, even though
cold, outweigh those of used-over air to be found in
indoor swimming pools.
Those registered in swimming are permitted to
swim at any hour of the day from nine o'clock in
the morning to six o'clock, and the pool is open on
Sundays. It is not necessary to report at a special
hour just so the swimming is done sometime during
the day. This feature alone should appeal to the
ordinary student.
One feature of this activity that the swimming
instructor failed to mention is the benefit of expert
coaching. Brandsten goes about his business, that
of producing swimming and diviging teams, with
very little clamor and noise, and he does the work.
