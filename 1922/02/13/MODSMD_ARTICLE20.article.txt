Reginald Terrenlialf, the noted deaf and dumb singer
hypnotized his audience in the Assembly Hall, last night,
with an unusually intriguing program, intriguing be
cause it was unusual, and unusual because it was care
fully arranged beforehand.
Such a recital as that given by Terrenhalf can leave
only the feeling that the program was twice as good as
it would have been it' it had been only half as good as
it was, to use an old Chinese proverb. In Accordiono's
"Caro Mio Homo," the artist appealer directly to the
imgination. Not a sound came from his lips, but some
how, everybody knew just what he would have sung if
he could have sung it. The words were printed on the
programs.
Among some of his first, and therefore best, frag
ments, was "Over the Hill to the County Jail," whimsi
cally suggestive of the land of the Kopps, an Italian
number (657-J). More restrained and dignified, but none
the less audible, were two Dutch numbers by Willsonz,
"The College Special," and "The Cocoanut Smash."
Terrenhalf made a mistake when he got on an old
English ballad, entitled, "We Feed Our Baby Garlic,
So's We Can Find Him in the Dark."
He (the artist) almost broke his thumb when he hit
the motif, and the audience thought for a moment he
was going to break out in song.
Larry Beer at the piano was, after all, the whole
thing.
* • *
WEATHER FORECAST —Rainy Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. Fine weather Sunday. This is Monday.
Tomorrow doubtful.
♦ * *
Florenz Ziegfeld, interviewed on "How To Pick a
Male Beauty Chorus," says:
"First—pick out all those that can't sing. Tell 'em
to leave, and keep the rest.
"Second —the tall, angular form of beauty is good, but
the short, feminine type is much better. Use 'em both
to nnike contrasts.
"Third —they must have a smile, either natural of
.fixed.
"Fourth —They shouldn't, know how to dance. That
would look unnatural.
"Fifth —Use 'em on every occasion except when you
don't have to."

Reginald Terrenlialf, the noted deaf and dumb singer
hypnotized his audience in the Assembly Hall, last night,
with an unusually intriguing program, intriguing be
cause it was unusual, and unusual because it was care
fully arranged beforehand.
Such a recital as that given by Terrenhalf can leave
only the feeling that the program was twice as good as
it would have been it' it had been only half as good as
it was, to use an old Chinese proverb. In Accordiono's
"Caro Mio Homo," the artist appealer directly to the
imgination. Not a sound came from his lips, but some
how, everybody knew just what he would have sung if
he could have sung it. The words were printed on the
programs.
Among some of his first, and therefore best, frag
ments, was "Over the Hill to the County Jail," whimsi
cally suggestive of the land of the Kopps, an Italian
number (657-J). More restrained and dignified, but none
the less audible, were two Dutch numbers by Willsonz,
"The College Special," and "The Cocoanut Smash."
Terrenhalf made a mistake when he got on an old
English ballad, entitled, "We Feed Our Baby Garlic,
So's We Can Find Him in the Dark."
He (the artist) almost broke his thumb when he hit
the motif, and the audience thought for a moment he
was going to break out in song.
Larry Beer at the piano was, after all, the whole
thing.

WEATHER FORECAST —Rainy Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. Fine weather Sunday. This is Monday.
Tomorrow doubtful.

Florenz Ziegfeld, interviewed on "How To Pick a
Male Beauty Chorus," says:
"First—pick out all those that can't sing. Tell 'em
to leave, and keep the rest.
"Second —the tall, angular form of beauty is good, but
the short, feminine type is much better. Use 'em both
to nnike contrasts.
"Third —they must have a smile, either natural of
.fixed.
"Fourth —They shouldn't, know how to dance. That
would look unnatural.
"Fifth —Use 'em on every occasion except when you
don't have to."
