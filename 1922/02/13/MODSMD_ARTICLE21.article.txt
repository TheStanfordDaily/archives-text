# ETCHINGS ON EXHIBIT AT STANFORD GALLERY
## 
### 
Considerable curiosity lias been aroused
as to how the etchings which are now
on exhibit in the Thomas Welton Me
morial Art Gallery were made. They
are made on thin sheets of copper or
zinc, though some drawings are made
directly upon the metal with a sharp
cutting point. As the lines of etchings
are made with freedom on the surface
of the plane and the cutting is done by
the action of acid, the metal is pro
tected by a wax composition impervious
to acid.
Through this ground, the lines are
drawn with a steel point laying bare the
metal which the acid attacks, widening
and deepening the lines. This is tech
nically termed "biting," and the suc
cess of the etching is largely determined
by the skill in the management of the
acid and control of the biting.
The wax ground is removed and the
lines filled with ink. not fluid; the sur
face wiped with printer's cloths, leaving
the lines full. Dampened paper is laid
[over the plate, felt blankets over that,
and the whole passed between heavy
steel rollers. The paper is pressed into
the lines, and takes up the ink, leaving it
embossed upon the surface of the paper.
