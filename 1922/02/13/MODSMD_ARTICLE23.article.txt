# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## IRISH PEACE MENACED 
### BY NEW ISSUES 
The growing fear of serious trouble
along the Tyrone, the outcome of the
"soviet" rule of the railroad work
ers, and the general air of tension,
threatening the peace of Ireland, are
causing much anxiety In England. The
dispatch of hundreds of British troops
to the aid of Ulster has offset the
liberation of the Irish political pri
soners held in England previous to
the truce. The position of the Col
lins government is further made more
difficult by the DeValera section who
have started a campaign to descredit
the Free State, in preparation for the
coming elections.
GENOA PARLEY POSTPONED
French politicians, hitherto obsessed
with the dread of the forthcoming
Genoa Conference, were rejoicing to
day at its postponement. The decision
to hold a preliminary session to de
cide on the agenda has given the
French hopes of having the Versailles
treaty left out of the conference
agenda. The United States govern
ment has not yet decided whether it
will take part in the conference, or be
a mere "observer."
YAP TREATY SIGNED
As an aftermath of the Washington
Conference, the Yap treaty was signed
between the United States and Japan
011 Saturday. It is expected to go to
the Senate very soon. The terms were
not made publiq, but it is known
that the main terms were that Japan
would recognize the right of the
United States of free access to the
Yap-Guam cables, and further promise
the U. S. certain privileges and rights
in radio-telegraphic service. The U.
S. would in return recognize Japanese
mandate over Yap.
