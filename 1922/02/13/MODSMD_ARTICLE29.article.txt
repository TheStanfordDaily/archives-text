GENE, Ore., Feb. 13.— (P. I. N. S.) —
Twenty-six students were automatically
suspended from the university after Feb
ruary 1 for failing to pay their laboratory
fees. By paying their fees, with an ad
ditional dollar for late payment, they
may regain student standing, but they
must then immediately petition the regis
tration committee in order to prevent
their grades from being forfeited.
