### 
What the Pittsburgh papers think
about Glenn Warner and his appointment
as head coach at Stanford for 1924 is
shown by articles printed in issues of
the Pittsburgh Times and Post, copies
of which have just arrived on the coast.
Not only Warner, but Kerr also, are
spoken of in tones of praise and regret
at their departure. Especially does Kerr
get praise for being an all-around coach,
capable of developing winning track and
basketball teams as well as football
elevens.
The sporting editor of the Pittsburgh
Gazette Times, Harry Keck, says in
part:
"There is genuine regret at Pitt be
cause of the unexpected loss of Kerr,
who was held in high regard by all per
sons concerned. It is a good bet that
some way would have been found to re
tain him if the university had had a
chance to compete with Stanford for his
services.
"The graduate at Pittsburgh
said the sentiment at Pitt was to hold
Warner to his contract for the next two
years, and that the athletic committee
would probably recommend such a
course."
R. M. Welsh, football writer of the
Pittsburgh Post, is evidently not upon
very friendly terms with Warner be
cause of the latter's decision to sign
with Stanford, yet lie nevertheless refers
to Warner as one of the greatest back
field coaches in the country, if not the
greatest.
