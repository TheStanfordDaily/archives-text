It is asking quite a bit of the war
veterans in the Peninsula American
Legion Basketball League to make them
compete with such experts as "Swede"
Righter, Bert Mills, and Birchfield, for
mer College of Pacific star. All three
play on the San Jose American Legion
team, which outclasses any other aggre
gation in the war veterans' league.

Bob Janssen started the season slowly
enough, but just now lie is going like the
proverbial house atire. The center played
through both Washington State and St.
Mary's games without a rest. His de
fensive playing is hard to improve upon,
but he is still weak in the shooting de
partment of the game.
Jimmy Bradshaw and Ed Reed, who
have gained prominence on the Nevada
football elevens, are rounding out their

last year of service for the Sagebrushers
playing basketball. Both were present
when the California quintet walked away
from Nevada by twenty points. "The
Rabbit" is a running guard.
Rogers has the weight and McHose
has the speed, so it puzzles Van Gent
quite a bit which one to start. It is tak

ing the former quite a while to round
into the form he showed in the Cali
fornia contests last year.
Statistics from Stanford's seven con
ference games show Da vies and McHose
running a close race for premier scoring
honors. McHose leads his captain hy
three points, having scored 48 to Davies'
45. Janssen and Richmond have made
12 apiece for the Cardinal.
Washington State came south to settle
with California as to which is the better
team, following the tie between the fives
at Pullman. They did, but the settle
ment was all on the side of the Bruins.
The Blue and Gold won both timesâ€”37
to 18, and 34 to 16.
Davies smashed into Grana so bard
Saturday night in the beginning of the
game that he had to take time out. He
| soon recovered, however, and went the
I rest of the contest at top speed.
