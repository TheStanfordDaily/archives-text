# PROFESSOR E. D. ADAMS ISSUES CATALOGUE ON THE WAR COLLECTION
## 
### 
Prfessor E. D. Adams, head of the
History department, lias recently issued
a catalogue of the Hoover War History
Collection, under the title "A Report and
an Analysis."
Contrary to the usual idea of the dull
ness accompanying statistics and library
catalogues no matter how valuable they
may be, the catalogue prepared by Pro
fessor Adams is interesting to the casual
reader. Ihe character of the collection
itself together with the unusual circum
stances under which it was gathered are
helpful in making the document interest
ing, but of more interest still is the
method in which it was prepared. It is
not mere lists of titles with explanatory
notes, but is instead a very dramatic
piece of work, containing an account of
how the collection came into being, how
it was and is now being gathered, and
its value to the future.
A few stories expressing the spirit of
adventure with which the gatherers were
seized from the outset of their under
taking are given in the report. Among
these are stories of "suppressing" docu
ments received in the dark streets of
London, and of buying clippings from a
French teacher, who desired Professor
Adams to find for him an "agreeable and
cultured American heiress."
The number of documents classified
under the different heads gives some idea
of the magnitude of the task of catalogu
ing the collection. The total number of
government documents is 27,000. The
society publications are estimated at 11,-
000, and the war propaganda collection
totals 9,000.
Many other divisions are contained
within the collection among which are
newspapers and periodicals, posters,
proclamations and orders, documents re
ceived from the Library of Congress by
an exchange agreement, files of clippings,
Belgian newspapers, and the unique
"Libre Belgique."
The report also contains a division con
cerning the connection between the war
history collection and the Stanford Food
Research Institute, with a brief outline of
the work of the Research Institute.
A great part of the collection is already
available for the use of advanced stu
dents or those who have had some ex
perience in research work.
