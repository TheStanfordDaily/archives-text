# HIGH-DIVING TOWER ON BOATHOUSE NOW READY TO BE USED
## 
### 
Plan* for attempting to construct a
high-diving tower in the middle of
Laguanita have been definitely aban
doned as a result of the completion of
the diving tower built on to the boat
house, and also as a result of the effects
of the windstorm which tore down the
original tower while it was in the
course of construction.
fcrnie Brandsten has now constructed
a high-diving tower which conforms to
all the regulations laid down by the
national swimming rules, and which is
more handy than one built out in the
center of the lake would be. This
tower is built as an extension of the
boathouse balcony. The top spring
board, in accordance with regulations,
rises 27 feet above the level of the
water when the lake is full, and the
lower springboard is 10 feet above water
level.
The only advantage a tower in the
midde of the lake would give, would be
that of greater depth of water. How
ever, in constructing the present tower,
a pit in the lake bottom was excavated
to make, the water deeper at that point
than it was before, which insures a depth
of 12 feet of water for diving purposes
when the lake is full. With the original
tower that was contemplated, a max
imum depth of 16 feet could probably
have been obtained.
Two springboards have been in
stalled on the recejitly completed tower
at the bathhouse, and high-divers may
now, when the lake is full, have a suit
able place for practice.
