and other departments which called for
laboratories and similar expensive fa
cilities. Because of this, the upkeep was
greater in the beginning days than that
of any similar university. The president
spoke of Stanford's economic value, to
California especially, citing as an ex
ample the work of Professor Ryan in
reducing materially the expense of elec
tricity throughout the state, as a result
of his laboratory experiments.
