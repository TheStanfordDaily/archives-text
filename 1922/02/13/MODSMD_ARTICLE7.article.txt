hive women, representing various
points of view in regard to ideal voca
tional occupations for women, spoke on
the branches of public work in which

ing, journalism, business, and public

for earning a livelihood.

ner, '06, who has for the past nine years

cial assignments, and Miss Anna Graeme

Mrs. haulkner's topic was "Journalism
as a Profession," and she dwelt upon the
live essentials necessary to a successful
newspaper woman, namely, news sense,
perseverance, the ability to think "on the
run," the faculty of grasping one's oppor
tunities, and a sense of humor. She held
that the sooner a woman reporter is able
to put aside her identity as a feminine
factor in the newspaper office and be
comes a part of thy working machine, the
sooner her success will be assured. There
is practically no branch of reporting that
a woman cannot cover, thinks Mrs.
Faulkner, if she is willing enough to un
dertake it, and has the determination to
get the story that she goes after. Two
years on the staff, of the Daily Palo Alto
during her undergrauuate days was the
sum total of experience with which Airs.
Faulkner entered the newspaper field.

gaged in the occupation of a reporter, and
has had many interesting experiences

Saturday.
Miss Eraser, who spoke on "Teaching
as a Profession," was most enthusiastic
concerning this as an ideal vocation for
j the modern woman. She looks upon the
schools of today as the mediums of great
est social service, and she considers that
through the teaching profession, a woman
may not only give of herself for the prog
ress of society through the training of
young citizens, but she may benefit in
turn from the invaluable mental and so
cial stimulus which is derived from con
tact with young minds and growing per
sonalities.
"Business as a Profession," was the
subject of a talk by Mrs. Alice Wulzen
Yates, secretary of the General Petrol
eum Corporation of San Francisco. Mrs.
ates looks upon the business profession
as only secondary to the real career of
women as home-makers. She holds,
however, that there arc great possibili
ties for women in business, especially in
the field of secretarial work.
Miss Sally Lucas Jean, director of the
Child Health Organization of America,
spoke on the subject of "Public Health
as a Profession." Miss Jean told of
the work that is being done through the
public schools in the matter of building
up a healthier standard of American
childhood, and pointed out the oppor
tunities which are afforded teachers to
help in this work, which is so essential to
the tomorrow of our country.
"The Professional Point of View"
was the topic which formed the intro
ductory note of the conference. This
subject was handled by an assistant pro
fessor of the department of economics at
Mills College, Mrs. Elizabeth Kenyon
Owen. The speaker handled her subject
as an adviser of women who are about to
go out into the professional world, and
she declared that a general attitude of
interest, determination, open-mindedness,
and active mental effort arc essential to
all whose claim is a successful business
career.

hive women, representing various
points of view in regard to ideal voca
tional occupations for women, spoke on

as a Profession," and she dwelt upon the
live essentials necessary to a successful
newspaper woman, namely, news sense,
perseverance, the ability to think "on the
run," the faculty of grasping one's oppor
tunities, and a sense of humor. She held
that the sooner a woman reporter is able
to put aside her identity as a feminine
factor in the newspaper office and be
comes a part of thy working machine, the
sooner her success will be assured. There
is practically no branch of reporting that
a woman cannot cover, thinks Mrs.
Faulkner, if she is willing enough to un
dertake it, and has the determination to
get the story that she goes after. Two
years on the staff, of the Daily Palo Alto
during her undergrauuate days was the
sum total of experience with which Airs.

gaged in the occupation of a reporter, and

Saturday.
Miss Eraser, who spoke on "Teaching
as a Profession," was most enthusiastic
concerning this as an ideal vocation for
j the modern woman. She looks upon the

may not only give of herself for the prog
ress of society through the training of
young citizens, but she may benefit in
turn from the invaluable mental and so
cial stimulus which is derived from con
tact with young minds and growing per
sonalities.

Yates, secretary of the General Petrol

ties for women in business, especially in
the field of secretarial work.
