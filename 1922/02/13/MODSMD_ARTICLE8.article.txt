Miss Workman graduated from Stan

she took an active interest in campus
dramatics and played in several produc
tions. The year following her gradua
tion she spent in los Angeles, giving
readings, producing plays, and building

was the second president. During this
time she also appeared in plays put on
by the Playgoers' Society.
From Los Angeles, Miss Workman
went to New York, where she was en
gaged for several years in productions
in that city and in road shows and stock
companies. She played with Maude Ful
ton in "The Brat" during its recent pro
duction in New York. Her latest en

Los Angeles in "The Ruined Lady."
During the time since she left Stan
ford, Miss Workman has kept tip her
dramatic readings and has appeared be
fore many clubs in the East, especially
at Columbia University. She says that
she intends her readings to be interpreta
tions of the meaning and spirit of th<
text, and not a means of displaying her
own talent.
Professor Bassett of the English de
partment says that she is a reader of
superior ability and charm.
