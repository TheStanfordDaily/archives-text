PANAMA CAN A.L EMERGENCY DAMS
GATUN LAKE, eighty-five feet above sea
level, is the reservoir holding the water
to feed the Gatun Locks (which lead to the
Atlantic) and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel
locks on the Pacific end of the Canal.
Every ship going through the canal in either
direction uses the water from Gatun Lake to
lift it from the one ocean and lower it into the
other. Should some accident destroy a lock,
the weight of water released might force down
the others and cause tremendous damage and,
by lowering the level of the lake, make the
canal inoperative until rain had refilled the lake.
Therefore these big emergency dams were con
structed. Normally they are not used. In
emergencies they would be swung over the
locks, the gates would drop into position and
effectually dam the opening.
Otis engineers designed, constructed and in
( stalled the machinery for operating six of these
gigantic dams. It is a feat typical of the world
wide scope of Otis activities in engineering and
the vertical transportation of men and materials.
Most of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators. "*
