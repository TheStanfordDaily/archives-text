# RULES ADOPTED TO GOVERN NEW HONORS SYSTEM
## Scholarship Committee Sets Minimum Requirements for Degrees With Distinction 
### 
The Scholarship Committee, to which
the Academic Council assigned the ad
ministration of scholarship honors, has
adopted regulations for the selection
of recipients of Lower Division honors,
Stanford Scholarships, and the recom
mendation of degrees "with distinction"
and "with great distinction."
For the A. B. "with distinction" a
minimum grade point average of 2:00
will be required, which is a B average.
For the degree "with great distinction"
and for the Stanford Scholars an av
erage of 2:40, or considerably above a
B, will be required. Last year the
average of Phi Beta Kappa, the scholar
ship honor society, was just 2:40. This
works out to mean practically that the
upper half of Phi Beta Kappa would
have received the "with great distinc
tion" honor, while the lower half and
about as many more would come within
the "with distinction" group.
For reckoning the grade point av
erages for determining graduation hon
ors the work of the five quarters pre
ceding the quarter of graduation will
be taken as a basis. Residence at Stan
ford for three quarters will be required,
and the work of transfer students be
fore they entered Stanford will be
worked out to conform as nearly as
possible to a Stanford basis. At least
forty units must be taken in the five
quarters on which the average is based.
Departments will be requested to rec
ommend students for Stanford Scholar
ships and for honor degrees, in order
that students who, through the general
or particular excellence of their work,
have attracted their own department's
attention may be brought to the special
notice of the Scholarship Committee,
and in order to have this special depart
mental knowledge of a student's fitness J
count in the selection of candidates, 1
such .recommendations will raise thfL
student's grade point average not more
than .10 points.
In case students desire it, depart
ments will be requested to offer com
prehensive examinations in the work of
their departments, and the results of
such examinations will be considered,
along with other records, in recom
mending honor degrees.
In determining grade point averages
the committee will disregard courses
marked merely plus and also courses in
Physical Education, Military Training,
and Music, except lecture or recitation
courses in these subjects that require
two hours of outside preparation for
| each class hour and in which written
| final examinations are given.
The new system goes into effect at
; once.

The Scholarship Committee, to which
the Academic Council assigned the ad
ministration of scholarship honors, has
adopted regulations for the selection
of recipients of Lower Division honors,
Stanford Scholarships, and the recom
mendation of degrees "with distinction"
and "with great distinction."
For the A. B. "with distinction" a
minimum grade point average of 2:00
will be required, which is a B average.
For the degree "with great distinction"
and for the Stanford Scholars an av
erage of 2:40, or considerably above a
B, will be required. Last year the
average of Phi Beta Kappa, the scholar
ship honor society, was just 2:40. This
works out to mean practically that the
upper half of Phi Beta Kappa would
have received the "with great distinc
tion" honor, while the lower half and
about as many more would come within
the "with distinction" group.
For reckoning the grade point av
erages for determining graduation hon
ors the work of the five quarters pre
ceding the quarter of graduation will
be taken as a basis. Residence at Stan
ford for three quarters will be required,
and the work of transfer students be
fore they entered Stanford will be
worked out to conform as nearly as
possible to a Stanford basis. At least
forty units must be taken in the five
quarters on which the average is based.
Departments will be requested to rec
ommend students for Stanford Scholar
ships and for honor degrees, in order
that students who, through the general
or particular excellence of their work,
have attracted their own department's
attention may be brought to the special
notice of the Scholarship Committee,
