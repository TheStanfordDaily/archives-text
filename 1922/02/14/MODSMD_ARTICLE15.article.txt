# PROBLEMS OF CHINA FORM LECTURE TOPIC
## Educators Show Progress of Chinese in Modern Ideas and Western Civilization 
### 
"Mind is stronger than environment.
The Renaissance movement in China
has changed the collective mind of the
people more in the last two years than
have the past twenty centuries," said
Professor William Hung, head of the
History Department at Peking Univer
sity, speaking yesterday afternoon in the
Little Theater on "Problems of the Pa
cific." Professor Hung and Henry W.
Luce, vice-president of the same uni
versity, are making a speaking tour of
the United States, talking at the leading
colleges.
"China's inability to move forward
has been a result of unwelcome pres
sure from without, which generations
ago forced her to build a wall of seclu
sion while the western world was
breaking away from barbarism," con
tinued Professor Hung. The use of
surplus energy in conquering repeated
invasions explains, lie said, why no con
tributions were made to thought in the
past seven centuries.
The real activity of the Renaissance
movement is in the educational sphere,
where the collective mind is more
quickly changed, Professor Hung be
lieves. It is interested politically and
economically only to create a national
interest and to secure adoption of
Western standards. The rapid rise of
newspapers, universities, and use of the
new alphabet, including only thirty
seven letters, are resulting in a national
consciousness and a spirit of inquiry.
Returning armies and students are
bringing back new customs and ideals.
"The fact that China and America
like each other will be important in de
ciding their exact relationships within
the next five years," said Henry W.
Luce in continuing the discussion of
"Problems of the Pacific." He then
outlined the four factors that arc to
make China a great power.
First, the Chinese have a democratic
outlook and approach to problems which
has expressed itself at least three times
during the last ten years.
Second, they are pacifists by temper
inent, always seeking reason rather than
force in settling disputes, in contrast to
their near neighbor with so highly cen
tralized a government.
Third, they have a keen sense of
humor, and, lastly, they possess a
strong basal mentality.
"America's finest gift to China is that
of higher education, for the Chinese,
above all, admire learning," said Luce,
and continued that progress made in
the last fifty years in educating women
and departing from the custom of early
marriage amounts to almost a miracle.
At the present time the University of
Peking is devoting its old buildings to
preparatory work and is constructing
more adequate buildings.
Whatever Confusionists feel about re
ligion. Luce says they are favorable to
Christianity, since it means for the up
life of China.
In concluding, he said: "In the four
hundred millions of Chinese and one
hundred million Americans, who to
gether constitute a third of the world's
population, w<? see two nations who can
work together because of common char
acteristics, and who can develop the
greatest civilization the world has yet
seen."

population, w<? see two nations who can
work together because of common char

greatest civilization the world has yet
seen."
"Mind is stronger than environment.
The Renaissance movement in China
has changed the collective mind of the
people more in the last two years than
have the past twenty centuries," said
Professor William Hung, head of the
History Department at Peking Univer
sity, speaking yesterday afternoon in the
Little Theater on "Problems of the Pa
cific." Professor Hung and Henry W.
Luce, vice-president of the same uni
versity, are making a speaking tour of
the United States, talking at the leading
colleges.
"China's inability to move forward
has been a result of unwelcome pres
sure from without, which generations
ago forced her to build a wall of seclu
sion while the western world was
breaking away from barbarism," con
tinued Professor Hung. The use of
surplus energy in conquering repeated
invasions explains, lie said, why no con
tributions were made to thought in the
past seven centuries.
The real activity of the Renaissance
movement is in the educational sphere,
where the collective mind is more
quickly changed, Professor Hung be
lieves. It is interested politically and
economically only to create a national
interest and to secure adoption of
Western standards. The rapid rise of
newspapers, universities, and use of the
new alphabet, including only thirty
seven letters, are resulting in a national
consciousness and a spirit of inquiry.
Returning armies and students are
bringing back new customs and ideals.
"The fact that China and America
like each other will be important in de
ciding their exact relationships within
the next five years," said Henry W.
Luce in continuing the discussion of
"Problems of the Pacific." He then
outlined the four factors that arc to
make China a great power.
First, the Chinese have a democratic
outlook and approach to problems which
has expressed itself at least three times
during the last ten years.
Second, they are pacifists by temper
inent, always seeking reason rather than
force in settling disputes, in contrast to
their near neighbor with so highly cen
tralized a government.
Third, they have a keen sense of
humor, and, lastly, they possess a
strong basal mentality.
"America's finest gift to China is that
of higher education, for the Chinese,
above all, admire learning," said Luce,
and continued that progress made in
the last fifty years in educating women
and departing from the custom of early
marriage amounts to almost a miracle.
At the present time the University of
Peking is devoting its old buildings to
preparatory work and is constructing
more adequate buildings.
Whatever Confusionists feel about re
ligion. Luce says they are favorable to
Christianity, since it means for the up
life of China.
In concluding, he said: "In the four
hundred millions of Chinese and one
hundred million Americans, who to
gether constitute a third of the world's
population, w<? see two nations who can
work together because of common char
acteristics, and who can develop the
greatest civilization the world has yet
seen."
