## 
### 
Miss Clara I. Taylor, who will speak
at the Y. W. C. A. meeting Thursday
afternoon, at 5 o'clock in the Women's
Clubhouse, was one of the first wom
en sent into Russia when the Y. W.
C. A. began its work there in April,
1917. Greater deprivations and risks
made it more difficult to recruit work
ers for Russia than for France; the
leaders of Russia appealed for aid in
solving their industrial problems and
the Y. W. C. A. sent the first help.
Miss Taylor made interesting investi
gations among industrial women in
Russia, and since her return to the
United States, she has made a definite
study of the industrial situation with
particular reference to women.
In the vicinity of Moscow. Miss
Taylor investigated 225 factories;
over half of these were engaged in
te? tile industries. There are 50,000
women in the factories around Mos
cow, excluding another 50,000 in the
sewing trades and employed as house
hold servants.
The work of the Y. W. C. A. in
Petrograd. Moscow, Samara, and Kief
had to be given up when the Bolshe
vik government ordered all foreigners
out in September of 191 S. Russian
women are continuing the work until
Americans can return. The only
branch open in Russia now is at Arch
angel, under the direct protection of
American troops.
After leaving Russia, Miss Taylor
studied the industrial situation of Eng
land, returning to the United States
'"or a similar study.
