# FRESHMAN QUINTET TO MEET BERKELEY HIGH
## 
### 
Coach Duffy Seay's Freshman team
will meet the Berkeley High School
team in the Pavilion Wednesday even
ing at S: 15 o'clock.
With a team that is almost intact
trom last year, the Berkeley High
School men will conic to the campus
with high hopes of repeating the 19-17
defeat of last season. The Babe team
of this year will have an advantage
of possessing two husky guards and a
fighting center, who have developed a
defensive play around the basket that
is almost impregnable.
Coach Seay spent the practice period
last night in basket shooting and in
scrimmage. Hoffman was back in uni
form last night with his knee in a brace,
and chances are good for him to play
in the California-Freshman game on the
seventeenth. Hooper was also back on
the floor after two days' vacation be
cause of a cold.
