# DR. ELY DISCOVERS CAUSE OF ARTHRITIS
## 
### 
Spoken of by students of medicine
as being on a par with the discovery
of the typhoid and tuberculosis germs,
if indications turn out as expected, is
the discovery made recently by Drs.
Leonard Ely and his associates, A. C.
Reed, and H. A. Wyckoff, of the Stan
ford Medical School. They have
brought to light the apparent cause
of deforming arthritis, a chronic type
of joint inflammation, and closely as
sociated with the ordinary chronic
rhematism which commonly attacks
people in old tge.
The report, as published in the Feb
luarv number of the California State
Journal of Medicine, ! s a preliminary
cne, but active further studies are
going forvard mi the hope of confirm
ing what may prova to be on. - ; of the
most striking of recent medical dis
coveries; a discovery which offers r i
probability of curing a disease hither
to thought to be practically incurable.
The amoeba that causes dysentary
are responsible for arthritis deform
ans, according to these investigations.
This amoeba histolytica is one of the
lowest forms of life, a single cell. It
has the power of living in the human
body and has long been known as the
cause of a certain form of dysentary
especially in the tropics, and also as
a cause of liver abcesses.
Scientists have been working for
many years on the subject of arthritis,
particularly its relationship to diseases
of the teeth and tonsils. Certain joint
diseases, including tuberculosis, have
been proven to be due to bacteria.
There was another large class, the
cause of which was a complete mys
tery. It is this mystery which is ap
parently solved by Dr. Ely's discovery.
The final scientific proof of this
discovery can come now only through
animal experimentation, but it is prob
ably that the immediate attention of
the medical profession and of research
workers in general will be attracted
to this field so that more evidence will
rapidly accumulate.
Dr. Ely and his associates were as
sisted in the discovery by the prelimin
ary work of Dr. C. O. Kofoid, the noted
expert on protozoology, and his asso
ciate, Dr. Olive Swezy, both of the
University of California. The result
is the culmination of long years of
work in the Stanford laboratories on
the subject of joint diseases. With
Dr. Ely in his preliminary work have
been associated Dr. John Francis Co
wan and Dr. Ernest C. Dickson, of the
Stanford Medical School in San Fran
cisco, and Dr. Arthur A. Meyer, Pro
fessor of Anatomy at the Medical
School here.
