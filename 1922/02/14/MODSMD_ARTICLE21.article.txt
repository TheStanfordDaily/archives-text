# Rewards for Scholarship
## 
### 
People attend a university for the purpose of se
curing an education. That is the main object for
anyone attending any institution of higher learning.
Activities have grown to a place where they are
regarded as essential parts of college lite. They fur
nish associations both within and outside the univer
sity. Through co-operation with others in the pro
motion of some project the individual receives valu
able training that fits him to take his place among
those who do things after college.
In order to get the student into activities certain
awards, peculiar to each activity, are given. They are
the prizes which induce the student to seek for the
broader education that comes from direct contact and
association with others in some common aim. They
cause the student who might otherwise become a book
worm to become acquainted with college life, the em
bodiment of which is activity, and to better himself
both physically and mentally.
Scholarship is unusually high in Stanford, and a
person who enters into activities must temper his par
ticipation, find that happy mixture that will allow him
to secure the classroom knowledge that he seeks pri
marily and the broader education which university
activities afford, which is. in the main, secondary.
When outside interests interfere with his studies he
is warned that he is neglecting his first purpose, and
if this continues lit is forced to say good-bye to
college for one year.
Now the A. B. degree, which has always stood for
the highest when secured at Stanford is to be cheap
ened. 'fhe ordinary mortal who attempts to secure
the broad education by mixing in all kinds of activi
ties while at the same time doing passing work in his
studies is to be penalized for not staying on the nar
row path. He receives a plain A. B.
Those who spend most of their time in studying
and who receive high marks will receive an A. B.
degree marked "With Distinction," and others, who
receive still better marks, will receive a degree with
the additional, "With Great Distinction."
Knowledge is its own reward. Dr. Jordan recently
said, "1 have always been opposed to honors and
prizes; if a student can't be stimulated by the idea of
getting knowledge, then he's not worth stirring up."
It will be maintained that a man can participate
in #:tivities and still make the 2.00 average necessary
to a degree with distinction. But what chance has a
man mixed up in activities to secure a 2.40 average,
which was the Phi Beta Kappa average last year, and
is the necessary mark to secure the degree "With
Great Distinction." It is a noteworthy fact that in
the majority of cases the man who sports the Phi
Beta Kappa key made his books and classes his soli
tary activity during his undergraduate days. Is there
any assurance that a 2.00 average will insure the sec
ond degree of an A. B. and that an average of 2.40
will insure the first degree in the future when stu
dents are aiming for the distinctions?
As a means of cheaping the A. B. degree the new
plan may be commendable if that is its purpose. If
its aim is to increase high scholarship and to replace
the Phi Beta Kappa key as the goal for application
to hooks and lectures, it is entirely unnecessary since
knowledge is its own reward.
