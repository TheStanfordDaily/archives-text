OUR OWN BOOK REVIEW
(By John A. Cabbagea)
"The Technique of Bumming" —By Orscar Voltage, pp.
819. (Mush & Co.)
In this book on bumming. Mr. Voltage takes up the
situation from all possible angles, and from three dif
ferent sides. The author has evidently had much per
sonal experience. He has evolved three rules that the
would-be bummer must follow to become successful.
They are:
1. Always be well-dressed. A hard-looking bummer
is as bad as a bum.
2. Don't be afraid to ask for a ride. Otherwise they'll
think you're too proud, and are waiting for a better
automobile.
3. Stand on a corner. In the first place, the middle
of the road is very inconvenient. Also, cars, when
rounding a curlier have a tendency to slow down. Third
ly, if you're sitting down, they'll think you're just a
decoy for a motor cop, or something.
The rest of this book Mr. Voltage gives to charts show
ing just what the chances are of getting a ride in vari
ous types of cars.
Altogether, it is well worth the price—of a hot dog.

OUR OWN BOOK REVIEW
(By John A. Cabbagea)
"The Technique of Bumming" —By Orscar Voltage, pp.
819. (Mush & Co.)
In this book on bumming. Mr. Voltage takes up the
situation from all possible angles, and from three dif
ferent sides. The author has evidently had much per
sonal experience. He has evolved three rules that the
would-be bummer must follow to become successful.
They are:
1. Always be well-dressed. A hard-looking bummer
is as bad as a bum.
2. Don't be afraid to ask for a ride. Otherwise they'll
think you're too proud, and are waiting for a better
automobile.
3. Stand on a corner. In the first place, the middle
of the road is very inconvenient. Also, cars, when
rounding a curlier have a tendency to slow down. Third
ly, if you're sitting down, they'll think you're just a
decoy for a motor cop, or something.
The rest of this book Mr. Voltage gives to charts show
ing just what the chances are of getting a ride in vari
ous types of cars.
Altogether, it is well worth the price—of a hot dog.
