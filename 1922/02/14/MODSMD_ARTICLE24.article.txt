"Her hulu girls, the sugar factories,
and the immense pineapple plantations
make Hawaii interesting to the Amer
ican," said F. Y. Chuck, '22, in his talk
before the Cosmopolitan Club in the
Women's Clubhouse last night.
"As the home of people of every
blood, Hawaii lias the peculiar signality
of not knowing what race distinction is.
It is not an uncommon incident for the
average school boy to register as 'one
fourth Hawaiian, one-sixteenth Portu
gese, one-fourth Chinese, one-eighth
Dutch, and one-third German."
The speaker described the seven most
important islands of the Hawaiian
group and gave the several theories ad
vanced by students of Hawaiian life,
concerning the origin of the people of
these mid-Pacific isles. Chuck told of
the mysterious Kahuna workers, who,
by supernatural means, will make life
long invalids upon the advice of a so
licitor.
In the election of officers following
Chuck's talk, Vivian Estcourt, '18, was
named president for the second time.
Araxie Vartanian, '21, and Otto Barby,
'24, were chosen vice-president and
treasurer, respectively.
