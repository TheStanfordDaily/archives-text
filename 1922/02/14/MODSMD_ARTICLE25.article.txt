The recent action of the faculty in
deciding to grant A.B.'s with varying
amounts of "distinction" seems to be
a step backward. High scholarship
does merit approval, but this means
of obtaining it may lead to bad results.
In the first place the very highest
scholarship is not always proof of the
student's superior worth, for in many
cases the student with the highest
scholarship is merely the one who has
let his studies interfere with his edu
cation. The present system of plus
and minus in the bawl-out should be
sufficient incentive to make the un
dergraduate do his best, and if the
University hangs out the additional
bait proposed it is overdoing the mat
ter. Good honest work is the thing
that should merit approval, and not
the ability to pass exes. The student
who comes here to actually learn
something new and learn it well is
more to be desired than the lunch
hunter who spends his time trying to
get good grades from the professors.
And what of the student who takes
one of those courses in which the only
grade, given is a plus or minus? Too
many students will shun that kind of
courses if it is liable to take any
"distinction" from their diplomas.
Then we have the honor system to
deal with. It is already hard enough
j for thai honor system to hold its own
j against the temptation to crib, and
I the proposed system would make this
worse. FREI) COVEY, *23
Just after I had gotten back a minus
paper, the news broke that the faculty
was going to change the meaning of
a degree. From now on a Stanford
man is not just a Stanford man, but
he Is a Great Distinction, a Plain Dis
tinction. or just a mere goat who kept
on paying his $95 for four years and
has a pretty blue ticket which says so.
Ever since Stanford was founded,
its degree has meant honor and
achievement to the winner. Stanford
pushed to the front scholastically and
athletically because it had the right
kind of men. Now the plan of things
has changed. We are to be scourged
ahead.
Men pushed the Cardinal ahead on
the field and in other activities, in the
old days, because they felt that they
i would get an equal recognition with
every other graduate. Phi Beta or
otherwise. They planned their sched
ule so they could make contributions
to the glory of Stanford, and still pass
their examinations, feeling sure of an
equal reward.
Now there is no more A.B. There
are but two real degrees and only a
receipt for those who have hung on
and worked for Stanford, perhaps even
more than for their marks. Now it
means nothing to have a plain degree.
The owner may have accomplished
what is considered the big aim of
education, to learn how to study, sav
ing specialization for later, and have
spent his time getting out of college
that which is peculiar to it, associa
tions and activity, but he is classed
with the dry-bawls who do neither.
Under the new plan, he has a bad
time trying to get by with a straight
degree. All the book-worm has to do
is to say. Great Distinction, and he is
I welcomed in. If the athlete or par
ticipator in any other constructive
activity attemps to recount his
achievements, by way of competition,
he is slated as a braggart. There are
many registered now who want the
highest degree but have slipped too
far behind working for Stanford to
ever get it. They will have to be
satisfied with the receipt.
The only fair thing to do, if distinc
tion is to illuminate the book-worm's
degree in gorgeous pink, is to print:
"This man went out for four years
and fought as a scrub with the var
sity," or "Sigma Delta Chi, Press Club,
! Ram's Head, Varsity Swimming," or
any like list of college honors in a

Just after I had gotten back a minus
paper, the news broke that the faculty
was going to change the meaning of
a degree. From now on a Stanford
man is not just a Stanford man, but
he Is a Great Distinction, a Plain Dis
tinction. or just a mere goat who kept
on paying his $95 for four years and
has a pretty blue ticket which says so.
Ever since Stanford was founded,
its degree has meant honor and
achievement to the winner. Stanford
pushed to the front scholastically and
athletically because it had the right
kind of men. Now the plan of things
has changed. We are to be scourged
ahead.
Men pushed the Cardinal ahead on
the field and in other activities, in the
old days, because they felt that they
i would get an equal recognition with
every other graduate. Phi Beta or
otherwise. They planned their sched
ule so they could make contributions
to the glory of Stanford, and still pass
their examinations, feeling sure of an
equal reward.
Now there is no more A.B. There
are but two real degrees and only a
receipt for those who have hung on
and worked for Stanford, perhaps even
more than for their marks. Now it
means nothing to have a plain degree.
The owner may have accomplished
what is considered the big aim of
education, to learn how to study, sav
ing specialization for later, and have
spent his time getting out of college
that which is peculiar to it, associa
tions and activity, but he is classed
with the dry-bawls who do neither.
Under the new plan, he has a bad
time trying to get by with a straight
degree. All the book-worm has to do
is to say. Great Distinction, and he is
I welcomed in. If the athlete or par
ticipator in any other constructive
activity attemps to recount his
achievements, by way of competition,
he is slated as a braggart. There are
many registered now who want the
highest degree but have slipped too
far behind working for Stanford to
ever get it. They will have to be
satisfied with the receipt.
The only fair thing to do, if distinc
tion is to illuminate the book-worm's
degree in gorgeous pink, is to print:
"This man went out for four years
and fought as a scrub with the var
sity," or "Sigma Delta Chi, Press Club,
! Ram's Head, Varsity Swimming," or
any like list of college honors in a
; bright Cardinal across the face of the
| ordinary sheepskin. I. A. D.
The recent action of the faculty in
deciding to grant A.B.'s with varying
amounts of "distinction" seems to be
a step backward. High scholarship
does merit approval, but this means
of obtaining it may lead to bad results.
