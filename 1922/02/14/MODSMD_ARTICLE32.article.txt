UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Berkeley, Cal., Feb. 14. (P.I.N.S.) â€”
Although the Junior dance will be
informal, cords will be barred. This
decision was made at a recent class
meeting, following the raising of the
question as to whether or not cords
could be worn to the informal dance.
The patrons and patronesses will not
be looking at the dancers all evening,
as a bridge party has been arranged
for them.
