### 
To become one of the "distinguished"
colleges of the United States in Reserve
Officers' Training Corps work is the
aim of the Stanford Military Depart
ment toward which officers and meji of
the local unit are working. • The War
Department annually publishes a list
of colleges so designated. Stanford was
an honor college during the war period,
but since the cessation of hostilities has
never been on the honor list.
The rating of the unit is given each
year by officials in charge of each corps
area and transmitted to War Depart
ment headquarters. Stanford, though
rating with the highest in the quality
of work done and interest shown by
men in the unit, has lost out recently
on account of a relatively small per
centage of men enrolled compared with
those colleges such as the University of
California, where the military work is
compulsory. Increased interest in the
work of the Military Department among!
the students at Stanford is the problem j
to which the department is seeking a I
solution. The enrollment lias been
gradually increasing eacli quarter and
it is hoped that in a short time Stan
ford will again rank with the highest.
