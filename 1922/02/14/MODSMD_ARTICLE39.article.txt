# EUPHRONIA SOCIETY TO PUT QUEENER ON TRIAL FOR HIS LIFE
## 
### 
To what extent is ardent queening a
defense for fraud? Or is it? A culprit
whose name has been suppressed is to
be placed on trial for this offense, which
he is said to have committed flagrantly
before a number of witnesses, at the
coming session of Euphronia on Thurs
day. Court will convene at 7:30 in
Room 12 of the Law Building. The
case will be heard before Homer Pat
terson as j 'dge, with Herbert C. Cob
lentz as district attorney, and C. V.
Smith as attorney for the defense. Re
ports have it that there is a deep mys
tery veiling the true nature of the
crime.
The attorney for the prosecution has
given out the following statement to the
press: "Conviction is certain from the
bare statement of the admitted facts now
in possession of our office; trial will be
merely a formal compliance with the
constitutional provision that no man
shall be deprived of his life, liberty, or
even property without due process of
law."
That sounds pretty bad for the ac
cused ; but look what the attorney for
the defense has to say: "My client has
been made the goat of the district attor
ney's frameup, yet 1 have absolute con
fidence in the justice of the law, and
know that the defendant will be fully
insulated from this ungrounded charge."
There you have it. All visitors are
welcome if they don't impugn the dig
nity of the court.
