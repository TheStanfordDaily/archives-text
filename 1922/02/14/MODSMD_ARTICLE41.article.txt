That the history of elevators dates j
back as far as 236 B. C.?
In that year Archimedes built a de
vice. operated by man power and con

The earliest passenger elevator was
installed in Convent St. Catherine on
Mt. Sinai in the middle of the Sixth
Century. It consisted of a capstan or [
windlass operated by the Monks, rais-!
ing and lowering passengers in a rope ;
basket.
Platform elevators were first made
about 1850. although the first instance
of a practical passenger elevator and '
known as a "vertical screw railway"
was installed in the old Fifth Avenue
Hotel, at Fifth Avenue and 23d Street,
New York City, which was crected in j
1859.
The fiirst successful electric drum j
elevator was installed by the Otis j
Brothers & Company in 1889 in the
A. T. Demarest Building at 33d Street
and Fifth Avenue. In 1905, the first !
important electric traction elevators 1
were installed by the Otis Elevator i
Company in the Majestic Building at !
Chicago which are still operating sue-j
cessfully.
As early as 1858, the name "Otis"
became identified with the elevator in
dustry through inventions by p]lisha
G. Otis. The firm of N. P. Otis &
Brothers was established at Yonkers,
New York, in 1861, subsequently
changed to Otis Brothers & Company ;
and incorporated in 1898 to the Otis
Elevator Company. The name of
"Otis" has thus been associated for
over half a century as the leader in
the development of the elevator art.
