NAVAL REDUCTIONS
The English Admiralty's disapprov
al of the naval economics proposed by
Geddes, was backed by the govern
ment. Viscount Asquitli led the oppo
sition, but his amendment lost by a
vote of 241 to 92, thus giving the Lloyd
George government a large vote of
confidence.
Secretary Denby is asking for $350,-
000,000 for the Navy for 1922-23 in
stead of $478,000,000. He also recom
mended that the personnel be reduced
from 100,000 to 90,000, but that the
number of apprentices be maintained
at 6,000. The House Committee is ob
jecting that this is drastic enough
and objects to the $350,000,000 ex
penditure as compared with the $107,-
000,000 annual pre-war cost of the
Navy.
Secretary Denby says there is no
need to reduce the number of officers
in the Navy and that the present class
should be graduated full strength
from Anapolis. However, he recom
mended that Congressmen be allowed
to appoint only three instead of five
candidates for the Naval Academy
in the future. It is interesting to note
the report that 5 per cent of the appli
cants for admission to the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology are An
apolis men who wish to transfer as
a result of the Washington Conference.
THE SOLDIERS' BONUS
As a result of the protest raised be
cause of the proposed increase in
taxes to procure the necessary funds
for the Soldiers' Bonus and the in
ability of the Senate and House to
agree on any method, the bill is being
held up, awaiting a suggestion from
President Harding.
He and Secretary Mellon have both
expressed themselves unfavorable to
bond issues to obtain the money. Nor
does President Harding favor the use
of the Allied War Debt Payments on
the ground that they are too uncertain.
The President is also opposed to pass
ing the bill without providing the
means for paying the bonus.
Though the Soldiers' Bonus was a
campaign pledge of the Republicans
they may use this difficulty and the
opposition as excuses for non-fulfill
ment.
