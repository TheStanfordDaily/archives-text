# STANFORD WINS FIRST BASEBALL GAME OF YEAR
## Federal Reserve Bank Squad Falls Before Pitching of Loewenstein, Clark and Nef 
### 
Baseball arrived at last, yesterday,
and the varsity emerged victors, 8-2,
over the Federal Reserve horsehide
tossers sent down from San Francisco.
As it was the first game of the season.
Coach Seay was not particular about
starting all his regulars in the line
up. Many substitutions were made.
Eighteen men from the varsity squad
played in at least a part of the game.
Lowenstein started as pitcher for
the varsity. He held the city nine to
one run and two hits, a double and a
triple, and walked one man. Nef went
in for the next three innings, and al
lowed one hit, a single, and one run.
This tally was the result of two bases
on balls and an infield error. The
last three frames saw Clark on the
mound. One bingle was all the oppos
ing forces could garner off, and no
runs resulted. Loewenstein struck out
one, Nef two, and Clark three. Draper
was not used at all during the game.
Lefty Heckendorf wielded the heavi
est bat of the day, knocking out a
home run on his first trip to the plate,
and garnering a triple on his next
chance. Smurr started the game at
third, and was relieved by Hecken
dorf in the fourth inning. Ratner
caught the whole game, and at his
last time at bat socked a triple to
deep center. Maillot played the first
part of the contest at short, and was
replaced later by Woodward, who was
moved in from the outfield. Peavy
took care of second, while Patterson
covered first. The latter gathered in
two singles during the afternoon, and
Woodward got one.
The outfield was shifted around as
much as any other part of the team.
Wayland, Fuller, Carver, Deffenbach,
Mitchell, Connolly, and Huneke, all
got a chance in the outer pastures.
The Federal Reserve team did not
show enough strength to make the
varsity worry, as all three of the Card
pitchers had the situation well in hand
all the time. Geizer, who pitched the
entire game for the visitors, scored
three strikeouts and allowed three
walks,
The next game to be played will
come on Thursday, when the Alumni
nine meets Ireland's Independents.
The Alumni plays the varsity on Fri
day, and on Saturday the varsity goes
up against the M. J. B. "Koffee Kids"
from San Francisco.
Following yesterday's game, Coach
Seay ran his men through an infield
workout. Zeb Terry, famous as one
of the leading shortstops in the Na
tional League, has been out on the
field with the varsity men lately giv
ing them tips on how to perfect a win
ring nine. Terry came up several
days ago in advance of the main
alumni team.

chance. Smurr started the game at
third, and was relieved by Hecken
dorf in the fourth inning. Ratner
caught the whole game, and at his
last time at bat socked a triple to
deep center. Maillot played the first
part of the contest at short, and was
replaced later by Woodward, who was
moved in from the outfield. Peavy
took care of second, while Patterson
covered first. The latter gathered in
two singles during the afternoon, and
Woodward got one.
The outfield was shifted around as
much as any other part of the team.
Wayland, Fuller, Carver, Deffenbach,
Mitchell, Connolly, and Huneke, all
got a chance in the outer pastures.
The Federal Reserve team did not
show enough strength to make the
varsity worry, as all three of the Card
pitchers had the situation well in hand
all the time. Geizer, who pitched the
entire game for the visitors, scored
three strikeouts and allowed three
walks,
The next game to be played will

Seay ran his men through an infield
workout. Zeb Terry, famous as one
of the leading shortstops in the Na
tional League, has been out on the
field with the varsity men lately giv
ing them tips on how to perfect a win
ring nine. Terry came up several
days ago in advance of the main
alumni team.

Baseball arrived at last, yesterday,
and the varsity emerged victors, 8-2,
over the Federal Reserve horsehide
tossers sent down from San Francisco.
As it was the first game of the season.
Coach Seay was not particular about
starting all his regulars in the line
up. Many substitutions were made.
Eighteen men from the varsity squad
played in at least a part of the game.
Lowenstein started as pitcher for
the varsity. He held the city nine to
one run and two hits, a double and a
triple, and walked one man. Nef went
in for the next three innings, and al
lowed one hit, a single, and one run.
This tally was the result of two bases
on balls and an infield error. The
last three frames saw Clark on the
mound. One bingle was all the oppos
ing forces could garner off, and no
runs resulted. Loewenstein struck out
one, Nef two, and Clark three. Draper
was not used at all during the game.
Lefty Heckendorf wielded the heavi
est bat of the day, knocking out a
home run on his first trip to the plate,
and garnering a triple on his next
chance. Smurr started the game at
third, and was relieved by Hecken
