# LAGUNITA TWO FEET FROM TOP; STADIUM DRAINAGE PERFECT
## 
### 
Water in Lagunita is within two feet
lof the top, and drainage lias been
turned into San Francisco Creek, as a
result of the floods Friday. This level
will he maintained until all danger of
storms has passed, when the lake will
he filled to the top level. Drainage from
small creeks on the surrounding hill
side was responsible for much of the
rise during the storm Friday.
Contrary to report, there was no wa
ter Friday in the stadium, to any depth.
The sumps were filled from water which
overflowed from a drainage ditch at the
open end, but this was soon drained off.
There was no settlement or washing of
the banks.
The flooding of Encina basement has
occurred twice before, although never
when there was anyone living there. P.v
placing check valves on the sewers im
mediately after the water went down, a
similar occurrence has been prevented.
The Civil Engineering and Bacteri
ology basements were also flooded, but
it was found possible, by using the lire
engine to pump out manholes during a
j storm, to prevent another such flood in
J any building on the campus.
