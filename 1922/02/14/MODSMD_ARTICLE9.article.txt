# Investigate Health Habits of Students
## 
### 
Dean Mary Yost and Dr. Clelia Moslicr
of the Physical Education Department
are investigating the health habits of the
women of the University to learn the
relation of their ways of living to their
academic efficiency. Cards have been
distributed to all women students which
contain spaccs to record the number of
hours of sleep obtained each night and
answers to other health questions. These
cards are to be filed at the dean's office!
and when sufficient data has been com
' piled to make clear the present situation,
constructive measures will be taken for
its correction.
"Too many non-academic activities is
probably the chief cause of the lowered
vitality of many college women," Miss
Yost said, and continued, "The women
of the University do not realize that the
j results of their bad health habits will
I last for years after they have graduated
j from college. After the situation on the
j campus is definitely known, it will be up
to the women to realize the seriousness
of the question and remedy it."
Dean Yost requests that all women in
the University co-operate with her and
with Dr. Moslicr in this investigation In
filling out the cards distributed to them
and filing at the dean's office.
