But he's really trying out
for Sales Manager
r r HE freshman who comes out for baseball
-*■ manager and who sticks is learning a lesson
which, whether or not it wins that honor for him,
should win some honors in after life.
He will learn that his plugging on the diamond,
his efforts four years heuce to get the upper hand
on his first job, and after that his striving to climb
into the managerial and executive class are all
part of the same game.
Now, just as ten years from now, he will have
to do many things'that are hard, many things that
are unpleasant. The more willing he is, the more
work will other men put upon him. Hut by that
he grows.
The rewards after college are given on about the
tsame basis as now. They go to the man who besides
doing his main job well, still has the time to reach
out after other work and the spirit that masters it.
Here is where this comes home to you. Don't
be content with standing high in the classroom.
Support your college activities and go after some
campus honors too. This broadening of your
interests will become a habit that in after life will
prove a mighty big help.
