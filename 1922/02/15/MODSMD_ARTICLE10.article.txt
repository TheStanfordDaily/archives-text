# Romantic Settings Will Tax Ability Of Stage Workers
## 
### 
An old French tavern, the king's rose
garden, and the royal gibbet will be the
: romantic settings for the action of the
English Club play, "If 1 Were King."
They will tax the ability of campus
scenery designers and builders.
The tavern will be the old-fashioned,
beamed ceiling kind, and it is here that
the duel by lantern light, one of the
most thrilling incidents of the play, will
take place. The second act is laid in
the garden during the day, and most
of the action will transpire on the broad
winding steps coming down from the
palace. The same place at night will
be the setting for the third act. Grue
some and foreboding will be the gal
lows which form tiie background for
the impressive denouement of the-fourth
act.
