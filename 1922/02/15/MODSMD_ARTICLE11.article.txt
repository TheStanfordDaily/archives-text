# LIGHT QUINTET MEETS BRUINS
## Cardinal Five Ready For Bout With U. C. Tonight, 7:15 Team Line-up is Promising 
### 
With almost the same team which
defeated the Blue and Gold lightweights
last year, Coach W. W. Young, '23, will
go after the bruin hide tonight at 7:15.
The Cardinal 130-pounders have not lost
a contest so far this season and have
steadily improved their game, and by
now should prove formidable against al
most any quintet.
The dope on the California five is
not much. They have been working out
so far with high-school teams, as Stan
ford has, so their real strength cannot
be estimated. The fact that several of
last year's squad have been playing with
them this season indicates that, what
ever the result shall be, the nucleus for
a good team is there.
Silviera will probably start as stand
ing guard tonight. He has played a
good, steady game all season. As run
ning guard, Blosser has substituted for
Young before, and may play tonight
if the boil on the coach's wrist proves
too painful.
Hogle is by far the best bet for
center. The last few games he has stood
out in both guarding and shooting. He
made the majority of field goals for the
lights the last half of the season.
Meyers, Kitow, Hollingsworth, and
Hobro are the men with most experi
ence in the forward berths. Coach
Young also may play up the court. He
has held down the position successfully
before. Whatever the combination is.
though, it is sure to he fast.
The game will be played as a pre
liminary to the Berkeley High-Fresh
man contest.
