UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON.
SEATTLE, Feb. 3—(Special)—That
the University of Washington and
Stanford university have the highest
scholarship requirements of any uni
versities in the United States is the
belief of Dr. Henry Suzzallo, president
of the University of Washington. Dr.
Suzzallo is a Stanford graduate.
"All universities require the 15 units
for admission," says I)r. Suzzallo, "but
no others place restrictions on grade
averages as Stanford and Washington
do. At Stanford a student must not
only be able to produce certified grades
] before he may matriculate, but he
must also have a recommendation as
to his character and seriousness of
purpose.
"The recent developments in schol
arship standing at Washington have
placed this univarsity on an equal
footing with Stanford. In order to re
registered here a student must show a
two-thirds average of C grades or
above. This fall a two-thirds A or B
high school average will be necessary
before matriculation."
