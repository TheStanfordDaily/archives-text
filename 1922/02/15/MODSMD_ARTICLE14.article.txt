# FIRST CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORT SENT TO ALUMNI
## Circular Contains President Wilbur's Message to Old Students on Drive Policy 
### 
A report of progress, together witn
answers to questions raised during the
endowment campaign, has been sent
out by the endowment offices to over
ten thousand Stanford alumni. A copy
of the booklet containing the state
ment of the Board of Trustees, the
uses to which the $3,000,000 is to be
put, and President Wilbur's message,
is enclosed. These bulletins are to
be sent out from time to time by cam
paign headquarters.
The letter, which is entitled "Notes
from Campaign Headquarters," stase:
"The plant to start at the Uni
versity as a center and work out
ward into the adjacent counties
then on to San Francisco and the
bay district, then south, stetp by
step, to Los Angeles, then north
to Seattle, and afterward east,
by states, is strongly commending
itself. This process will furnish a
laboratory which, will disclose any
weak spots in our methods before
it is too late. The campaign will
thus carry momentum as it pro
ceeds. Special attention can be
given to each local center by
strong University representatives
and alumni leaders. We can thus
measure the interest and capacity
of our own Stanford people. There
is everything to be gained by con
centrated attention upon one lo
cality or one district at a time.
"The grogram of procedure in
the First Million for Stanford is
deliberate and measured because
there is 110 precedent in Stanford's
history by which we can govern
ourselves. While we are taking
advantage of the past experience
in the university world in under
takings of this kind, the Stanford
problem is unique and must be
adjustable. A new mental atti
tude among the firiends of the Uni
versity has to be secured or as
sumed. Sympathy and allegiance
has been the response everywhere
as the Stanford situation has be
come understood.
"There will be no top-heavy
overhead organization. The en
dowment committee which was
appointed by the Board of Trus
tees will be in general supervision
and direction. The next step will
be straight down to the local or
ganization.
"All lists of prospective subscrib
ers will be made up at headquar
ters. This will eliminate much of
the local detail work. These lists
will in due time be sent out to
each locality to be supplemented
and corrected.
"The question of quotes for vari
ous districts has been raised.
This will be a matter for local de
cision after a careful process of
consideration in the community
or district itself, as the time of
the actual canvass approaches."
Regarding class action, the bulletin
makes the following statement:
"It is not advisable to have a
class canvass as such, there will
be progressive reports of what
each class does.
"It would be unwise to cut
across the plan of district cam
paigns with a national campaign
for class subscriptions, but the
same thing can be accomplished
by preparing class members for
the approaching campaign in their
districts and stimulating them to
the largest possible response on
behalf of the class. Headquarters
will send out bulletins at the close
of each district campaign showing
the additions which have been
made to the class subscriptions.
At the close of the entire cam
paign the total amount subscribed
by members of each class will be
reported. These class totals may
be made a part of permanent class
funds if desired."
