# BABE NINE OPENS SEASON SATURDAY
## Coach Kallam's Men to Play Palo Alto High School; Line-up Slightly Crippled 
### 
Coach Moyd Kallam's freshman base
ball nine will meet Palo Alto High
School in the first game of the season
here Saturday. The 1925 squad is slowly
rounding into shape and promises to de
velop into a fast aggregation.
Injuries, sickness, and poor scholar
ship, however, threaten to wreck the ma
chine at any time. Jim Lawson, who has
been performing in great style behind
the bat, is out of the game for some time
with an injured leg. Cuddeback, the
best third-sacker 011 the squad, was taken
with the influPnza yesterday and will be
out of the running for several days.
Follansbee, one of t>ic most promising
prospects for the mound position, is just
recovering from an attack of the inflii
enza, and will not be in shape for some
time.
When all the men are back in shape the
babe diamond team should be one of the
strongest and best balanced turned out
here in recent years. Johnson. Jim
Lawson, and Connor are the three catch
ers 011 the squad. Johnson is doing the
bulk of the work in this department
since Lawson was injured. It is possible
that Johnson will be moved to the out
field when Lawson returns. He is a
heavy hitter and cannot be kept off the
team. Connor can be relied upon in case
the other receivers'are out of the game.
The pitching staff is particularly
strong. league, Aydelott, Solomon,
Howard, Gray, and Follansbee are show
ing up well. All of these chuckers arc
lacking in experience, but they will tin
doubtedly develop during the season.
Solomon and Follansbee seem to be the
best bets. Solomon has a world of speed
and a pretty curve, but is lacking in con
trol.
The infield is the strongest part of the
team. McCandless is the best choice for
first base. He is a heavy hitter and
handles himself well in the field.
"Shorty" Roberts will probably have lirst
call on the job at the keystone sack when
the season starts. Cuddeback on third
and Mnlkey at short are playing a good
brand of ball and they will probably start
in these positions Saturday. Cuddeback
is a good hitter and a clever fielder,
while Mulkey handles himself well in his
position.
The outfield is the weakest department
of tiie 1925 squad. Several men are run
ning a close race for places in the outer
gardens. Chamberlain, Brown,. Dick
Lawson, and Krogness are showing tip
best. These men are good fielders, but
none of them arc reliable batters. If
McDonald works into the position at
first. McCandless wil lbe sent to the out
field. When Jim Lawson returns, John
son will go to the outfield. These men
will strengthen the team a great deal is
hitting as well as fielding.
