# Properly Regulated

### 
Two importatn steps were taken by the Executive
Committee last night that will go far toward the
correction of evils resulting' from underclass
activities.
Regulation by "S" men of the baseball fight with
a specific set of rules governing that contest will
eliminate the objectionable features which resulted
in its being stopped last year. The baseball fight
this year will begin when the two combatant classes
assemble on the field for the game of baseball. Pre
liminary battles and kidnaping have been tabooed.
The ball will be thrown into the air and the class
which recovers it will by employing strategy and
skill relay the ball from the baseball field to a place
of safe-keeping. The ball may be returned to the
baseball captain at any indefinite time. Thus the
fight practically ends when one class has secured the
ball in a place that is unknown to the opposing side..
The return of the ball to the captain merely gives
official recognition to the winning class.
This plan will eliminate the second fight to return
the ball to the captain. Battering rams, barbed wire
entanglements and mob-fights which during the past
four or five years have resulted in injuries to the
participants will be done away with. The fight will
be staged within two hours and instead of brawn |
being the essential requisite to victor}- the brain will !
play an important part.
The entire success of the plan will depend upon
the enforcement of the rules. Each class, through a
committee, will be made acquainted with the rules
governing the contest. This committee will be
directly responsible for the conduct of its class. The
Men's Council will punish all violators of the rules
laid down. Supervision of the contest will be in the 1
hands of "S" men.
With the rules well defined and the machinery of
the classes and of the student Ixxly well organized
and working efficiently the fight should be staged as
a battle of wits and the danger of its permanent dis
continuance done away with.
The bonfire for the annual bonfire rally is also to
be regulated.
Objection to this underclass project comes from
the fact that so much time is taken from studies and
activities for its construction. It was deemed inad
visable to limit the size of the' fire. The plan
adopted will require greater organization and more
efficiency. Freshmen will work ten hours on the fire
and guard five. Four days will be spent in its con
struction. This will force the sophomores to organ
ize the machinery for construction, to provide means
of bringing wood to the scene of the blaze, and to
work every man every minute of his ten hours if a
creditable blaze is to be built.
Under this plan the benefits from co-operation
with members of his class and the good of broader
acquaintanceships to be made around the campfire
will be secured to the freshman and he will not be
required to put in so much time that it will interfere
with his studies or other interests.
