# Fighting Professionalism
## 
### 
Realizing 1 the dangers that confront college ath
letics unless steps are taken to combat profes
sionalism, university presidents of the northwest
have taken action that will if followed out go a long
way toward preventing the occurrence of any such
scandal as occurred in the middle west recently.
By this action, the executives of the leading uni
versities of the Pacific northwest have agreed to
assume responsibility for the preservation of the fair
names of their institutions bv seeing that the resolu- ,
tion which was drawn up is followed out.
This resolution is as follows: I hat no athlete
shall remain in good standing in any institution who
is known to receive money for playing, or unreason-

able compensation for any employment given him
during any part of the year, in 'consideration of his
athletic ability.
An added step is the adoption of a clause that
subjects the actions on questions of policy by the
Northwest and Pacific Coast conferences to review
by the executives of the institutions represented in
these conferences.
It is certain that witn college athletic policy sub
ject to this check and with responsibility for the
maintenance of the fair name of athletics in the hands
of the executives the danger of professionalism
creeping into Pacific Coast colleges will be greatly
minimized.
