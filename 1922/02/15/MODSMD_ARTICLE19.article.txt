President Ilehry Suzzalo of the University of
Washington expresses the belief that Stanford and
the University of Washington have the highest
scholarship requirements of any universities in the
United States.
He outlines the admission requirements here and
adds that recent developments in scholarship stand
ing - at Washington have placed that university on an
equal footing with Stanford.
It is pleasing to know that Stanford was recog
nized as the leader in high scholarship requirements,
and we are glad to welcome the University of Wash
ington to an equal position, making it a dual leader
ship.
