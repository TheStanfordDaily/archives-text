For the first time in history (no ex in this) Encina's
downstairs got thoroughly cleaned, not to say pressed.
Janitors are justly indignant—the closed shop prin
ciple was at sthke, backed to the wall, washed ashore.
Inhabitants are even yet sneering at their efforts to
raise a dust. What is life without the morning sneeze?
* ♦ *
Walking delegates, sent out in flying squadrons, are
making a sweeping effort to run Jupe Pluvius down and
sign him up in the union.
* * *
That wasn't the worst. The 5-5-3 ratio went blah,
pedal strength was raised eight inches, a new gunboat
was launched every five minutes. Flood victims re
mained under cover. The less wary went in for intra- [
mural swimming in a body.
♦ * * *
But every catastrophe has a compensation. Ain't it
the truth? Or ain't it? As soon as the cleansing waters
receded, laundry agents stepped forward and announced
that work left in boxes would be reduced to half price. :
* * *
Cabbages "Patronize O&r Advertisers" drive—pardon
us, campaign—brought quick results. Wednesday the
classified claims that the new fire truck may get its
first workout on your dump, better tear in and grab
off a policy. Next night they raze the roof,
* * *
We're all for the new stunt of distinctive sheepskins.
Just like a lodge. Lotsa fun. Pretty quick we oughta
be able to call 'em off from the left like this: "Supreme
Lord High Distinction, Great Panoramic Distinction,
Colossal Conditional Distinction (the little guy behind
the post), Illustrious Illuminated Distinction with Fancy
Lettering"—all the way down to Partial Extinction.
* * *
It sure is the auk's eye-lashes. How the heck can
a professional tryoutee keep up his record when they
rope in a cast of fifty?
* * *
We hate to criticize. But—of all the brodies —why
did the S. P. haul off and blow several thousand bucks
on the tunnels, and then hire a guy to light the gosh
darn lights?
* * *
Profs Hung, Luce, give a heavy spiel. Gotta hand it
to them. Had an axle that way once, but the doggone
thing gave us an awful let-down.
♦ * ♦
Seems like there's a Renaissance movement in China.
So that's what they call it. Next time, by golly, we won't
order any of the—eh—renaissated hash.
* * *
We like to see a. real man's man, pardner, talkin' he
man language. Why, damn it all, bucko, we gotta cut
loose some time, hey? And if the chorus effected him
like that, he's got a right to say so right out before
folks.
«■ * »
Biffing a tasty bingle off the plate, Hugo, the mid
night moth, remarked that some pipe-courses turn out
to be midnight lunches.

"If I Were King" directors choose a cast of fifty, and
—what the heck—leave out Red's room-mate.

Cabbages' candidate for Qreat Distinction —the canta
loupe who stays up all night memorizing the dope-sheet.

But we hand all prizes to the mug who asks for a
make-up because he spent the hour working on the
endowment, to increase profs' salaries.

"Ah, yes," she murmured, whispering sweet zeros in
his ear. "Life is so round! A square man must have
a hard road to hoe."
"I say, Doris—"

"Reginald, you shouldn't say such things. You're a
sweet boy, but you have a sour face. No, no, silly,
don't wiggle your ears. It spoils tlie part."

"Doris, you are irresistible! Your indifference cuts
me to the quick. Oh, my love! My Life! My gosh!

city, and only $1.50."
