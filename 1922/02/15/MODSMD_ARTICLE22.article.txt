Differing in part with your last
. night's editorial, it seems to me that
the plan just inaugurated by the Uni
versity in regard to the recognition of
r high scholarship is good in one part
and undesirable in another. That part
of the plan that gives recognition of
high scholarship to the student while
he is in the university seems only
just, as I will try to point out; that
part of the plan that gives permanent
recognition by printing on the diploma
the fact of high scholarship is unfair.
Some students believe that they can
get the most out of college by engag
ing in outside activities; others be
lieve that they can get the most out
of college by sticking to their
books, their sole activity. It is wholly
a matter of individual belief. By re
cognizing outside activities, such as
athletics, etc., we are penalizing the
man who chooses studying as his ac
tivity. None can arbitrarily say that
outside activities are more beneficial
and deserving of reward than is the
inside activity of study—it is wholly
a matter of opinion. So if we are to
recognize and reward the one we must
also recognize and reward the other.
True, knowledge has its own reward,
BUT no more so than have outside
activities. Because if knowledge has
more reward than outside activities,
then it would only be fools who would
go in for outside activities, as long as
they claim that studying has more
reward, and that it pays better. Let
us not penalize the man who chooses
study as his activity—at least until
that time comes when it is clearly
established that the one choice is su
perior to the other.
For the same reason let us not
penalize the man who chooses outside
activities. He has as much right to
his choice as the man that chooses
study—none can positively say which
i is the better. But we would be penal
-1 izing the choosers of outside activities
as soon as they leave college, since
the man who has a diploma reading
"with great distinction" or "with dis
tinction" is permanently rewarded be
cause the diploma is a instrument for
years to come in getting jobs, etc. If
we are to give permanent recognition
and reward to those who choose study
as their activity, we ought to likewise
give permanent recognition and re
ward to those who choose outside ac
tivities, as long as it can not be arbi
trarily said that the one choice is su
perior to the other. So if we are to
make mention on the diploma of the
achievements of those who choose
study and scholarship as their activity,
we must also make mention on the
diploma of the achievements of those
who choose outside activities. It does
not seem feasible to list the latter,
hence justice demands that we do not
list the former.
To sum up—let us then give recog
nition and reward to them whose ac
tivity is study and scholarship to the
same extent that we recognize and re
ward those whose activities are out
side activities. As long as we recog
nize the latter in college let us like
wise recognize the former. But as long
as we recognize the latter in college
let us likewise recognize the former.
But as long as we do not recognize
and reward outside activities perma
nently, that is, after the student leaves
college, let us refrain from recogniz
ing and rewarding permanently (by
diploma distinctions) scholarship and
study activities.

Dear Sir; — Does an A.B. degree
mean the same identical amount of
conscientious work accomplished to
every recipient? Does every Stanford
man who receives an A.B. work just
as hard, study just as long, reason
just as well, and devote his time just
as conscientiously as every other grad?
If an A.B. does mean these things,
then there is no shadow of a just
reason why A.B.'s should be granted
with varying degrees of distinction.
But it is at least doubtful whether
wen who have been on probation a
majority of their undergraduate quar
ters and who have just managed to
"get by" one course and "slip through"
another —and the men barely above
the line are by no means few —it is
doubtful whether these have actually
done as much academic work or have
gotten as much out of their lessons as
the average student (1.4). And it is
just as questionable whether the aver
age student deserves as much cre
dit as the "two per center."
Be it remembered that the student
who goes out for no activity in college
and at the end gets only the degree
and a chance at Phi Beta Kappa after
all gleans but pretty "slim pickings."
The man who goes out for athletics
has first of all fun, he makes friends,
he gets good publicity, he may "rate"
a varsity "S" or a numeral, and he gets
a whole lot of personal satisfaction. I
Likewise, journalism, dramatics, and j
debating all have their own rewards,
in the form of publicity and honors.
But the man who is just a "student",
the man who is here to get an educa- ;

» tion and goes after it, the man who
pays just as high tuition as the
; "slacker" gets nothing but the same
I degree as the other, though that other
may have been (and probably was)
enjoying a "city party" while the real
"student" was working oil his lessons
until the same hour of the early morn
ing.
Stanford is not the first university
to differentiate between good and fair
students. Harvard has long main
tained this custom in both graduate
and undergraduate schools. The plain
fact of the matter is that the Phi
Bete works harder than the rest of
us; and if that added distinction at his
time of graduation means anything to
him, let him have it.!
Most of us won't ever look at our
diploma after we get it; we certainly
won't carry it with us when we go
after a job. A Stanford man is no less
a Stanford man because his degree
carries no indication of exceptional
scholastic attainments. Many of those
who will receive the new distinction
will be teachers and professors. Surely
if those few added words will help
them either in getting a position or in
beginning with a certain reputation,
those of us who haven't worked until
12 o'clock every night reviewing our
day's work shouldn't deny these real
students the only honor they can work
for—and one which the rest of us don't
deserve.
Let's be fair. If* an A.B. means one
man has done his work better and
more thoroughly than another, let the
A.B. bear witness of the fact.
"TWENTY-TWO."
