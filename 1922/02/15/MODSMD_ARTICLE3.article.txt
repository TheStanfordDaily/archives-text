# ALUMNI DIAMOND MEN TO OPPOSE VARSITY
## COUCH TO TAKE SLAB FOR "VETS" IN TOMORROW'S GAME; DRAPER IS SEAY'S BEST BET 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock the
Ahimni team of Los Angeles will meet
the Stanford varsity. Two other
games will be played at Stanford this
week. On Friday the Alumni and
"Cliff" Ireland's Independents will
take the field against each other in
the game which was to have been
played on the thirtieth anniversary of

"Cliff's" first game against the Cards,
February 9. Satui'day's contest is to
decide honors between the varsity and
the M. J. B. Coffee Kids.
In Monday's game against the Feder
al Reserve nine, Coach Seay discover
ed that he had two teams of good
players rather than just one. Although
the Feds did not show up as fast
company, the manner in which Loew
enstein, Nef, and Clark held them
down to four hits and two tallies is
a good indication that the Card pitch
ing staff is to go strong this sea
son.
In both the infield and outer gard
ens there is to be some sti'ong compe
tition for the berths. Ratner at first,
is one of the best catchers and all
which gets the horsehide down to
second fast and sure. Captain Green
i sone of the best catchers and all
round players who ever wore a Card
uniform, and, with the recovery of
his injured knee, he will be on the
job again and sure to qualify for one
of the nine berths.

Woodward is in the running for an
infield job and so is Smurr, player on
last year's Freshman nine. "Bud"
handles himself well in both initial
sack and short territories, while Smurr
plays a good game around third. To
offset these men are the veterans,
Patterson, Heckendorf, and Maillot, all
of them hard to displace. Mitchell
and Peavy are the strong candidates
for the keystone and they have demon
strated that with either of them on
hand it will be well taken care of.
To pull down the high ones in the
outlying territories, there are Carver,

Wayland, Parker, Deffenbach, Connol
ly, Fuller, Howe, and Huneke.

Coach Seay has not given out a de
finite line-up for toßnorrow with the
exception of the battery of Draper
and Ratner. With sucn men as Couch,
Terry, and Reagon pitted against his
proteges, it is a certainty that the
Card coach will use his best bets,
starting the game with the veteraßis
who have proven their ability.

Tom Workman, '14, manager of the
alumni team has his men lined up as
follows: Workman, c; Couch, p;
Hayes, Ist; Maple, 2ud; Reagon, 3d;
Terry, ss; Beeger, If; Cass, cf; Hager
man, rf; Wickersham and Lifur will
be in reserve for the slab job.
