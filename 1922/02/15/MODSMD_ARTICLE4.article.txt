# MISS CLARA TAYLOR TO TALK ON MODERN LABOR QUESTIONS
## 
### 
Miss Clara I. Taylor, who has been
active in the work of the Y. W. C. A.
among the industrial classes of Russia
during the years of 1917 and 1918, will
speak in the Women's Clubhouse Thurs
day afternoon at 5 o'clock.
Mine. Catherine Breshkovsky, "the
little grandmother of the Russian Revo
lution," who joined with Miss Taylor
in her work, took time in her multi
plicity of duties to aid the American
women who were helping her beloved
Russia. Some of the bad practices
which Miss Taylor found in her indus
trial investigations were night work for
women, child labor, no welfare work
ers, lack of educational facilities, and a
serious problem of unemployment. In
the Survey for February 1, 1919, Miss
Taylor says:
"Step by step, dating from the Rev
olution of 1917. beginning with the or
ganization of professional unions, a
comprehensive industrial organization
has been eyolving which is now actually
participating in the management of pro
duction." Membership in the unions is
compulsory, with 2 per cent of wages
required monthly as dues. Each indus
try is represented in the district soviet.
Miss Elizabeth Buckingham will give
a reading before the talk by Miss Tay
lor. Refreshments will be served, after
the meeting, which is intended tn lie a
"get-together" for the women of the
University.
