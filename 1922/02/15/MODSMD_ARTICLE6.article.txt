# VARSITY BASKETBALL SQUAD MAKES READY FOR OREGON SEES
## 
### 
As soon as the Lemon-Yellow quintet
from the University of Oregon fills its
two-game engagement at Berkeley, it
will trek south to Stanford for a return
series witli Van Gent's five this week
end.

The games Friday and Saturday night
will ring down the curtain 011 varsity
basketball for the year on the Stanford
courts. The varsity will meet California
on February 25 in the Oakland Au
ditorium, and if a third game is neces
sary, it will be played at the same place.

The Cardinal cage squad, always but
one step ahead o£ misfortune, has been
overtaken by the jinx again. This time
Bob Janssen is the victim. Influenza has
very effectively laid up the varsity cen
ter, who had just rounded into top form
in the last three contests. He was taken
to San Francisco yesterday, and there is
little, probability of his being able to
play in the Oregon series.

Even with Janssen on the sick list, the
Stanford team holds the psychological
advantage of being the favorite over
George Bohler's battered crew. "Thir
teen games played—and thirteen lost"—
is the extraordinary conference record
of the, Lemon-Yellow basketers this
year.
Two of those thirteen setbacks were
handed the Oregonians by Van Gent's
quintet on its trip to the north a few
weeks ago. The margin of victory was
small in both games, however.
The circumstances will be more favor
able for a Cardinal victory than before.
Van Gent's men will be playing on their
own court, and they will catch the
Lemon-Yellow squad on the tail end of
its southern trip. When the teams met
before, the Stanford basket-shooters
were suffering to some extent from the
train journey and the change of climate.
Last night Van Gent set to work once
more to patch up bis court machine. All
the members of the first five were on the
floor with the exception of Janssen.
Richmond is gradually recovering from
the effects of the influenza. Ray Pitts,
who played a spectacular game at run
ning guard in the California fracas, has
been out for the last few days with a
severe "charley-horse" in his leg.
Nobody wins and nobody loses, what
ever the outcome of the Stanford Ore
gon games so far as conference stand
ings are concerned. The Cardinal bas
keters have slight chance to catch
either Washington State or California,
who are ahead of them in the percentage
column. On the other hand, Oregon is
so deeply mired in the cellar, that it will
take more than one victory to pull her

As soon as the Lemon-Yellow quintet
from the University of Oregon fills its
two-game engagement at Berkeley, it
will trek south to Stanford for a return
series witli Van Gent's five this week
end.

The games Friday and Saturday night
will ring down the curtain 011 varsity
basketball for the year on the Stanford
courts. The varsity will meet California
on February 25 in the Oakland Au
ditorium, and if a third game is neces
sary, it will be played at the same place.

The Cardinal cage squad, always but
one step ahead o£ misfortune, has been
overtaken by the jinx again. This time
Bob Janssen is the victim. Influenza has
very effectively laid up the varsity cen
ter, who had just rounded into top form
in the last three contests. He was taken
to San Francisco yesterday, and there is
little, probability of his being able to
play in the Oregon series.

Even with Janssen on the sick list, the
Stanford team holds the psychological
advantage of being the favorite over
George Bohler's battered crew. "Thir
teen games played—and thirteen lost"—
is the extraordinary conference record
of the, Lemon-Yellow basketers this
year.
Two of those thirteen setbacks were
handed the Oregonians by Van Gent's
quintet on its trip to the north a few
weeks ago. The margin of victory was
small in both games, however.
The circumstances will be more favor
able for a Cardinal victory than before.
Van Gent's men will be playing on their
own court, and they will catch the
Lemon-Yellow squad on the tail end of
its southern trip. When the teams met
before, the Stanford basket-shooters
were suffering to some extent from the
train journey and the change of climate.
