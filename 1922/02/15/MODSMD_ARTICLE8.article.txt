# "LILIOM" IS READ AT LECTURE IN LITTLE THEATRE
## Miss Gertrude Workman Gives Dramatic Interpretation of Popular Eastern Play 
### 
-Miss Gertrude Workman gave a dra
matic , reading of Franz Molnar's
"Liliom" last evening in the Little
Theafer. "Liliom" made a sensational
run in New York from last April until
it closed two weeks ago. It has caused
much comment and discussion from the
dramatic critics of America.
AI iss Workman read only the most
important and dramatic episodes of
"Liliom" and gave descriptions of the
intermediate passages. She has a pleas
ing voice and the power to change and
modulate it at will, so that the stage
seems peopled with actors.
"To produce such a play in New
York requires tremendous courage," said
Miss Workman in explaining the his
tory and import of the drama. "It
was put on by the Theater Guild of
New York." She gave a brief sketch
of the rise and work of the Theater
Guild. "The Washington Square Play
ers were disorganized by the war," she
said, "and, like a phoenix, three years
ago the Theater Guild came out of the
ruins of former association. It has a
group organization like the English
trade guild. It puts on five plays a
year, two or three of which are given
only once or twice.
"The first production of the Theater
Guild was 'The Bonds of Interest' by
Jacinto Benavente and was doomed to
failure. This was, perhaps, a fortunate
thing, because it tested the faith of the
organization. Since then its attempts
have resulted in both success and failure.
"The Theater Guild is controlled by
a board of managers, who are at pres
ent a banker, a lawyer, a playwright, a
producer, and an actress. At the be
ginning of every season subscription
tickets are sold. These are its only
endowment. Jts purpose is not to make
money, but to increase the reality, sin
cerity, and beauty of the stage."
Miss Workman gave a short biography
of the life of Franz Molnar, the author
of "Liliom." He is the son of a weal
thy Jew in Budapest. He was educated
at the Universities of Budapest and
Geneva. Among his works are nine
long novels and several dramas. He is
considered a critic of merit in Europe.
Miss Workman graduated from Stan
ford in 1912. During her college course
she was interested in dramatic study
and took part in several campus plays.
Since that time she has had engage
ments in New York and with road
shows and stock companies. She played
with Maude Fulton in "The Brat" dur
ing its New York run. Miss Work
man's most recent engagement was at
Los Angeles in "The Ruined Lady."

said, "and, like a phoenix, three years
ago the Theater Guild came out of the
ruins of former association. It has a
group organization like the English
trade guild. It puts on five plays a
year, two or three of which are given
only once or twice.
"The first production of the Theater
Guild was 'The Bonds of Interest' by
Jacinto Benavente and was doomed to
failure. This was, perhaps, a fortunate
thing, because it tested the faith of the
organization. Since then its attempts
have resulted in both success and failure.
"The Theater Guild is controlled by
a board of managers, who are at pres
ent a banker, a lawyer, a playwright, a
producer, and an actress. At the be
ginning of every season subscription
tickets are sold. These are its only
endowment. Jts purpose is not to make
money, but to increase the reality, sin
cerity, and beauty of the stage."

-Miss Gertrude Workman gave a dra
matic , reading of Franz Molnar's
"Liliom" last evening in the Little
Theafer. "Liliom" made a sensational
run in New York from last April until
it closed two weeks ago. It has caused
much comment and discussion from the
dramatic critics of America.
AI iss Workman read only the most
important and dramatic episodes of
"Liliom" and gave descriptions of the
intermediate passages. She has a pleas
ing voice and the power to change and
modulate it at will, so that the stage
seems peopled with actors.
"To produce such a play in New
York requires tremendous courage," said
Miss Workman in explaining the his
tory and import of the drama. "It
was put on by the Theater Guild of
New York." She gave a brief sketch
of the rise and work of the Theater
Guild. "The Washington Square Play
ers were disorganized by the war," she
said, "and, like a phoenix, three years
ago the Theater Guild came out of the
ruins of former association. It has a
