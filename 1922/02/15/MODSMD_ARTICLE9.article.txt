# PHI KAPPA SIGMA WINS LEAGUE ONE PLAQUE
## 
### 
A three-point margin gained in the
last few minutes of a close court battle
gave Phi Kappa Sigma's quintet the
championship bronze plaque of league
one. Phi Kappa Psi was on the short
end of the 10-7 score.
This contest contained some of the
snappiest playing of the intramural sea
son, since the teams were evenly bal
anced. with good teamwork, and very
fast. The low score was due largely to
close guarding by each five. Phi Kappa
Sigma tried to work the ball down to
the basket until the last of the game,
when the forwards began to take
chances on longer shots. Similarly, the
Phi Kappa Psi men carried the ball
down the court, only to drill into a
husky pair of guards. Rough-and-tum
ble play was on a par with thrills.
At the end of the first half, Phi Kappa
Psi was leading, 4 to 3. This advan
tage was changed to 7 4 in the second
period, and, with four minutes to go,
the Phi Psi quintet held a one-point
lead. Sweeney, Phi Kappa Sigma for
ward, had tossed in a long shot. At
this stage Sweeney ran under the bas
ket aful dropped the ball through.
Thomas, who played a strong game at
center for the winners, found the bas
ket, making the final score 10-7. Newlin
and Fish were the point-gainers for Phi
Kappa Psi.
