# ZIMMERN GIVES REMEDIES FOR EUROPE'S CRISIS
## Situation Across Ocean Is Spoken of as Economic and Democratic Struggle 
### 
"Fellowship is life; enforced fellow
ship is death," said Alfred E. Zimmern
last night in the Little Theatre, speak
ing on "The Political Framework of
Economic Policies and Specific Refer
ence to Economic Conditions." Zim
niern is making a tour of America and
visiting some of the larger universi
ties. He is editor of "The Greek Com
monwealth" in London, and is a mem
ber of the faculties of Oxford College
and the University of Wales.
"The two conflicting principles of
Europe today are democracy and those
economic forces with which you are
so familiar in America," Zimmern Laid
in defense of the map of Europe as it
stands today. He added that the
problem is to find some working ad
justment between them. The two fol
lowing solutions are the most prob
able:
First, the policy known as recipro
city, or customs union, which aims at
large economic units, and has as its
exponent Joseph Chamberlain in Eng
land, and such men as Franklin Van
derlip in America. The second is the
doctrine of equality trade condi
tions or, as referred to ex-Presi
dent Wilson,
tion.
With reference to the first solutioh?i
Zimmern outlined the five important
attempts at customs unions that were
made during the nineteenth century
and which he said failed because the
majority of people did not want them.
"To forward the cause of customs
unions," he said, "you must accept
those treaties based on self determina
tion and work for closer political
union on the basis of satisfying na
tionality." Customs unions can suc
ceed, he feels, where there is no out
side traditional antagonism, but they !
are an unnecessary stepping stone to !
federations a3 shown in the delay in j
America before adoption of the Con-!
slit ut ion.
"Ecp a'uty of trade must and is sup- i
planting free trade, which would be
profitable only under static condi
tions," he said, and added that "it is
the present time the occepted Amer
ican policy."
"The greatest disappointment of
1918 was, I feel, losing the opportun
ity to establish some effective form
of co-operative machinery," Zimmern
said. "In the future we must look j
not to a single world policy but to
co-operation in economic policy be
tween all states of the world, realiz
ing how the shoe fits the other per
son."
Equality of trade involves an ad-1
vance from self determination to
thinking in terms of the world, ac- j
cording to Zimmerns, "to a comity of I
nations for which we must have a j
world of opinion that is actuated in
altruistic motives."
