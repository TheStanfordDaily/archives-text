semble work, and individual interpreta
tions in dancing and requires the talent
in this line of all women interested.
1 lie theme deals with events in the
early days of Britain, during the time of
the Roman occupation, and will be car
ried out entirely by pantomime. Numer
ous dancing numbers and a wide variety

example of the great number needed in
the cast and group work to make a

will not be presented on that day. An
early date in May will be set.

1 lie theme deals with events in the
early days of Britain, during the time of
the Roman occupation, and will be car
ried out entirely by pantomime. Numer
ous dancing numbers and a wide variety
of pageantry will be presented in its por
trayai. The production of the Memorial,
Pageant in 1919 is remembered as an
example of the great number needed in
the cast and group work to make a
pageant effective. This fete will include
women only and it is apparent that only
through the concerted action of the
whole women's student body may the
undertaking prove a success.
Miss Edith Pasmore, instructor in
physical education, is in charge of danc
ing. She was a coach for the Parthenia
given by the women of the University of
California last year. Her experience in
managing the production of pageantry
and complicated interpretative work in
volving large numbers of women, has
more than fitted her for a position of this
kind.
The Women's Athletic Association
plans to make the pageant an annual af
fair for the benefit of the endowment
fund. The slope near the President's
house by the lake has been chosen as a
suitable site for it. Due to the usual full
program on Alumni Day, the pageant
will not be presented on that day. An
early date in May will be set.
Janice Dunker, '21, has begun work on
planning and designing costumes for dif
ferent scenes. They are expected to be
particularly elaborate to carry out a bright
setting, work on which is now under way
under the direction of Chrysella Dunker,
'22. The central committee, composed of
the heads of different divisions of the
work, is appointing committees for as
sistance. The central committee in
cludes: Anne Hardy, '21, chairman;
Catherine Donald, '22, staging, grounds;
Katberine Taff, '22, stage construction;
