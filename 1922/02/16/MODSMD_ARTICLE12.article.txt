# LIGHTWEIGHT FIVE LOSES FIRST GAME TO BLUE AND GOLD
## 
### 
Stanford's 145-pound basketball five
lost its first, game this season to the
University of California weight team,
Tuesday evening, by a score of 2!)
to 1(>. This game served as a pre
liminary to the California-Oregon fray
in the Oakland Civic Auditorium.
The Blue and Gold men had superi
or teamwork, a natural result of play
ing together for two years. During
the present season they have been
under the tutelage of varsity coach
Wright, and of ten games played have
lost none. The Cardinals were easily
equal to the Bruins as individual play
ers, but Stanford teamwork was lack
ing. A return game will take place
on the local floor.
Phil Neer piloted the team, and
scored 10 of the 16 points. Poleski,
at standing guard, was a hard man to
get around, and is considered as a
"find" for the team. Hood, and Sum
mey alternated at forward; Hamilton,
Cornell and Christianson exchanged
at center; while Coplen, Paul and Joe
O'Hara traded off at running guard.
Stanford held the Bruins down In
the first half to 11 to 8. In the second
period, however, the Blue and Gold!
men got loose on open shots, and be
gan to drop the ball through the net
with regularity. Although the Stan
ford passing was good at times, in
accuracy on the longer shots cost
many points.
