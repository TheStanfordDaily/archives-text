# OREGON COURT SQUAD ARRIVES FOR GAMES WITH VARSITY FIVE
## 
### 
With two more defeats just stamped
on their credentials by the Blue and
Gold, the University of Oregon basket
ball squad, accompanied by Coach
George Boliler, arrived on the campus
today.
The Lemon Yellow players lost no
time in donning their basketball togs
and holding a short work-out in
the Pavilion to familiarize themselves
with the baskets and the spring floor.
It is going to be a case of "do or
die" for the Oregon quintet when it
meets the Cardinal this week end. In
the past defeats have meant nothing
to them, and they have been sacrificed
no less than fourteen times to make
a holiday for some other team.
If the Oregon five is ever to win
a game, it must do so in the Stan
ford series. The dope says that Ore
gon's list of defeats will have grown
to sixteen and the Lemon Yell w will
have finished the season without a
single victory after the coming series
with Van Gent's proteges. The dope,
however, is acknowledged to be un
reliable.
One thing is certain. The team that
beats the Oregonians at the rate they
are now gofng will have to play at
least good basketball to turn the trick.
Bohler uses substitutes to good ad
vantage, and the defensive playing of
the Lemon Yellow made the margin
of victory comparative small in both
the California games.
When the Cardinals returned from
the northern trip, various members
expressed the opinion then that Ore
gon was just striking its stride, and
that hereafter the Webfooters were
going to be hard to beat. Subsequent
games of the northerners have parti
ally born out that prediction.
Van Gent is stumped by the question
of whom to put in Janssen's place at
center. Howell had the call on the
job the first of the season, but re
cently he has been turning his atten
tion to track also. Piggott, who got
into the California game for a few
minutes, seems to be the logical can
didate. The rest of the Cardinal flock
are going as well as at any time dur
ing the season. Rogers and McHose
are fighting it out for the position of
running mate to Davies at forward.
The lighting in the Pavilion will be
improved by the installation of the
remainder of the high power reflector
lights. When the bulding was com
pleted there was only half enough of
the regular type, and a make-shift ar
rangement had to be used until the
rest could be obtained from the East.
The Pacific Coast Conference race
is practically over. But two or three
conference games remain to be play
ed by the various teams, and these
will have little effect on the standings.
In the northwest, Washington
and Idaho have been making basket
ball history for 1922. The Huskies
were the Goliath with ten straight
victories and the championship prac
tically conceded to them by the cage
fans. The Vandals from Idaho, in
their first year in the conference, as
sumed the part of David. They did
what most people said couldn't be
done—they defeated the Washington
five two games in a row, 37 to 31,
and 32 to 28.
The brace of wins makes Idaho
favorites for the conference champion
ship, although they have played but
six games.

fans. The Vandals from Idaho, in
their first year in the conference, as
sumed the part of David. They did
what most people said couldn't be
done—they defeated the Washington
five two games in a row, 37 to 31,
and 32 to 28.
The brace of wins makes Idaho
favorites for the conference champion
ship, although they have played but
six games.
With two more defeats just stamped
on their credentials by the Blue and
Gold, the University of Oregon basket
ball squad, accompanied by Coach
George Boliler, arrived on the campus
today.
The Lemon Yellow players lost no
time in donning their basketball togs
and holding a short work-out in
the Pavilion to familiarize themselves
with the baskets and the spring floor.
It is going to be a case of "do or
die" for the Oregon quintet when it
meets the Cardinal this week end. In
the past defeats have meant nothing
to them, and they have been sacrificed
no less than fourteen times to make
a holiday for some other team.
If the Oregon five is ever to win
a game, it must do so in the Stan
ford series. The dope says that Ore
gon's list of defeats will have grown
to sixteen and the Lemon Yell w will
have finished the season without a
single victory after the coming series
with Van Gent's proteges. The dope,
however, is acknowledged to be un
reliable.
One thing is certain. The team that
beats the Oregonians at the rate they
are now gofng will have to play at
least good basketball to turn the trick.
Bohler uses substitutes to good ad
vantage, and the defensive playing of
the Lemon Yellow made the margin
of victory comparative small in both
the California games.
When the Cardinals returned from
the northern trip, various members
expressed the opinion then that Ore
gon was just striking its stride, and
that hereafter the Webfooters were
going to be hard to beat. Subsequent
games of the northerners have parti
ally born out that prediction.
Van Gent is stumped by the question
of whom to put in Janssen's place at
center. Howell had the call on the
job the first of the season, but re
cently he has been turning his atten
tion to track also. Piggott, who got
into the California game for a few
minutes, seems to be the logical can
didate. The rest of the Cardinal flock
are going as well as at any time dur
ing the season. Rogers and McHose
are fighting it out for the position of
running mate to Davies at forward.
The lighting in the Pavilion will be
improved by the installation of the
remainder of the high power reflector
lights. When the bulding was com
pleted there was only half enough of
the regular type, and a make-shift ar
rangement had to be used until the
rest could be obtained from the East.
The Pacific Coast Conference race
is practically over. But two or three
conference games remain to be play
ed by the various teams, and these
will have little effect on the standings.
In the northwest, Washington
and Idaho have been making basket
ball history for 1922. The Huskies
were the Goliath with ten straight
victories and the championship prac
tically conceded to them by the cage
fans. The Vandals from Idaho, in
