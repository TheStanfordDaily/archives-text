this afternoon on the local diamond. This
game, postponed for a week because of
rainy weather, offers a real test to Coach
Seay s men, for Tom Workman's aggre
gation of* former college players is
powerful. There are some stars of the
first magnitude on the squad, and con
sistent practice has developed the alumni
in the technique of teamwork.
Johnny Couch, who lias been coaching
the varsity pitchers, opposes his proteges
this afternoon. 1 his offers a good chance
to see how the pupils are comparing with
the teacher. Couch, who has played
with the San Francisco Seals the last two
years, goes to the big leagues this season.
Another man that has been a big help
to the varsity is pitting his skill against
them in the game this afternoon. This is
Zeb Terry, famous shortstop of the Chi
cago Cubs. He arrived on the campus
in advance of the rest of the alumni, and
has been out on the field regularly.
The next game on deck comes when
the alumni hook up with Cliff Ireland's
Independents tomorrow afternoon on
the local lot. The game will begin at
3:30. Ireland is due to bring his bunch
down to the campus three more times
this season, to oppose the varsity, and
this game will offer the fans and near
fans a chance to see how dangerous Cliff
and his bunch are going to be this year.
The Independents have always had one
or more big league players on the team,
and the whole aggregation has long been
famous for their pep and life on the base
ball diamond.
The alumni line-up for tomorrow's
game will be practically the same as that
which opposes the varsity today. Work
man has three pitchers to rely upon—
Couch, Wickersham, and Lifur, in case
lie does not want to use the same one for
both contests.
On Saturday the *<«rsity meets the M.
J. B. Coffee Kids here. Whether or not
the Coffee Kids have any grounds for
claiming they have a good team is still
undecided, as far as local dopesters are
concerned, but from advance reports,
they have an able bunch of ball tossers.
One of the Federal Reserve Bank play
ers, when leaving the campus Monday,
remarked that the M. J. B. team was
capable of cleaning up almost anything
around tliis territory, as they have sev
eral real horsehide experts in the aggre
gation.

1 lie varsity baseball team and tin?
alumni nine are striving for supremacy
this afternoon on the local diamond. This
game, postponed for a week because of
rainy weather, offers a real test to Coach
Seay s men, for Tom Workman's aggre
gation of* former college players is
powerful. There are some stars of the
first magnitude on the squad, and con
sistent practice has developed the alumni
in the technique of teamwork.
Johnny Couch, who lias been coaching
the varsity pitchers, opposes his proteges
this afternoon. 1 his offers a good chance
to see how the pupils are comparing with
the teacher. Couch, who has played
with the San Francisco Seals the last two
years, goes to the big leagues this season.
Another man that has been a big help
to the varsity is pitting his skill against
them in the game this afternoon. This is
Zeb Terry, famous shortstop of the Chi
cago Cubs. He arrived on the campus
in advance of the rest of the alumni, and
has been out on the field regularly.
The next game on deck comes when
the alumni hook up with Cliff Ireland's
Independents tomorrow afternoon on
the local lot. The game will begin at
3:30. Ireland is due to bring his bunch
down to the campus three more times
this season, to oppose the varsity, and
this game will offer the fans and near
fans a chance to see how dangerous Cliff
and his bunch are going to be this year.
The Independents have always had one
or more big league players on the team,
and the whole aggregation has long been
famous for their pep and life on the base
ball diamond.
The alumni line-up for tomorrow's
game will be practically the same as that
which opposes the varsity today. Work
man has three pitchers to rely upon—
Couch, Wickersham, and Lifur, in case
lie does not want to use the same one for
both contests.
On Saturday the *<«rsity meets the M.
J. B. Coffee Kids here. Whether or not
the Coffee Kids have any grounds for
claiming they have a good team is still
undecided, as far as local dopesters are
concerned, but from advance reports,
they have an able bunch of ball tossers.
One of the Federal Reserve Bank play
ers, when leaving the campus Monday,
remarked that the M. J. B. team was
capable of cleaning up almost anything
around tliis territory, as they have sev
eral real horsehide experts in the aggre
gation.
