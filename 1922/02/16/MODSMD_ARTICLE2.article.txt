# WOMEN'S WIT TO BE MANIFESTED IN NEXT NUMBER OF CHAPPIE
## 
### 
A challenge to the five hundred is
implied in the opportunity which they
have been given to edit the next number
of Chaparral. For the first time in sev
eral years, the grand high moguls of
Hammer and Coffin have been persuaded
that there is enough wit among the femi
nine element on the campus to put out a
Chappie which can hold its own among
the regular run of humor that is mani
fested each month in that publication.
Whether or not that wit does exist the
campus will be given a chance to deter
mine when the Feminine Fling makes its
appearance early in March. All women
are urged to make contributions of verse
and prose, ink drawings, jokes, or any
material, cither original or clipped from j
other publications, suitable for publica- J
tion in the Chaparral. Tf contributions
are not original please signify from what
publication they are taken.
Material for the Feminine Fling must
be in the hands of the editors by Monday
evening, February 20. Mail all contri
butions to Box 713, Campus, or hand to
Bertha Vaughan.
