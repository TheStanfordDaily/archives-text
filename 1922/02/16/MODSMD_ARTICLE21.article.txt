# Grading the A. B.
## 
### 
Sentiment among the students on the recently in
stituted system of making the A. 15. degree seems
to be set strongly against it. Opinions were solic
ited personally among various groups around the
campus by reporters on the Daily Palo Alto. When
the person interviewed had decided views on the
subject they were recorded either for or against.
When the person had not given much thought to
the matter his opinions were disregarded.
Several interesting facts were developed by the
inquiry. For one thing, if the faculty believed that
the changes as adopted would create but little stir
among the students, they guessed wrong. It was
found that the percentage of the students who had
no decided views was very low. The argument
against the marking of the A. B. is that it does
not take into account other activities. Several
ventured an opinion that if the degree is to be
marked at all it should be marked on a basis of
all-round ability in all branches of university activ
ity rather than on classroom work alone.
Both classes of students were solicited and it is
surprising to find that men who are likely to make
Phi Beta Kappa and With Great Distinction are in
many cases against the new plan.
Apparently, then, opposition to the new method
<ioes not come from disgruntled students who have
jio chance to make a distinctive degree.
