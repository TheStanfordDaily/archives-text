Stanford academic authorities have long frown
ed on the ownership of automobiles on the campus.
President Wilbur has publicly outlined his objec
tions to the practice, but 110 definite ruling regard
ing the matter has been passed by the University.
It has been the aim of the administration to leave
all such matters as fully as possible to student con
control in the belief that constructive movements
started by the students are more effective.
The first definite stand against car ownership on
the Stanford campus was taken by the author of
"Gasoline Consumptionâ€”lts Effect And Cure" in
this month's issue of the Stanford Pictorial. The
writer points out many of the evils resulting from
the practice, and proposes several remedies for ef
fecting the cure.
The writer suggests that the University either
forbid the use of autos to everyone or to under
classmen. He says, however, that nothing could
prevent the first and second year classes from using
machines owned by the older men, in case the under
class ruling were passed.
The second means of eliminating the use of cars
on the campus, as proposed by the writer, is for
students to go on record as opposed to the practice
and the third for the students to enact a definite
resolution prohibiting the ownership of cars by
those living on University grounds.
This same problem has been met by Princeton,
according to an editorial in the New York Herald,
in a most constructive way. "It has not directly
expressed its opinion 011 that practice so plainly,"
says the editorial, "to the parents of the students
forbidden its students to keep motor cars, but it has
that the growing evil doubtless will be ended."
To pass a ruling prohibiting the use of automo
biles, or at any rate, the ownership of them 011 the
campus would create too much opposition. It
would too nearly verge 011 infringement of personal
liberty. But were both the student body and the
administration to go on record as opposed to motor
ownership on the campus, and at the same time dis
seminate this information by means of regular Uni
versity publications to prospective matriculates, the
problem would be practically solved.
In order to make this move really effective, stu
dent sentiment would have to be unanimously back
of it. 1 f the student body wants to make a construc
tive move toward the furtherance of Stanford dem
ocracy, it need but express itself as opposed to auto
mobile ownership on the campus.
