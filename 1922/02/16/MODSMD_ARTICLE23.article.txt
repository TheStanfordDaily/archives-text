As long as the University retains the system of
essay examinations at the end of each quarter,
would is not he wise to institue a four-dav examin
ation period to replace the present three-day plan?
The unfairness of requiring a student to write
two four-hour examinations in one day and to pre
pare for his next day's tests is brought out every

courses are hit hardest by the present system. An
added day to care for examinations in the eleven
o'clock courses would lighten the burden ol the stu

dent and be an aid to him in the effort to secure a
better grade.
Yes and no examinations are growing in popu
larity and may at some future time replace the essay
examination, but as long as the essay style is re
tained, with its long hours of writing and longer
hours of cramming, a separate day should be given
for each examination for morning classes.
