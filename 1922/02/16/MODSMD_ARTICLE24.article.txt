# The
						Woman's Pageant
## 
### 
Work on the spring pageant to be given by the
women of the University for the Endowment fund
receives a new impetus in the trvouts for the danc
ing numbers which began today and will continue
tomorrow afternoon. Following thes£, preliminary
rehearsals will start.
This is undoubtedly the largest undertaking the
women have attempted and since it is to be the
beginning of what is to become an annual custom,
its success is all the more imperative.
An undertaking of this kind can be a success only
by means of that indespensable element in any such
endeavor —cooperation. The pageant should there
fore be a one hundred per cent affair, in which all
women connected with the University will partici
pate.
The great number and variety of the dances which
will form the important part of the pageant will
permit of an unusually large number of women tak
ing part, and the work has been arranged so that
not a great amount of their time will be demanded.
The number of tryoutees for a place iti the en
semble and solo numbers will be an index of inter
est on the part of the women, and a forecast of the
success of the forthcoming production.

MOST OF THE COMMUNICATIONS appear
ing in the "Another Viewpoint" column are from
students who are not identified with any activity.
Very few men who are participating in various un
dergraduate enterprises have written their views
on the present question of making the degree. Is
it because they have no time to spend in putting
down their thoughts?

VISITORS AT THE BASKETBALL games
with Washington remarked that Stanford students
did not support their team very well when it was
losing. A large attendance at the games tomorrow
night and Saturday will check that false impression.
