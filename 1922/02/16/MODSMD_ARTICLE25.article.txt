A poor frosh won't know what to do any more. If he
goes Row he maybe gets burnt out; if he decides to
stay Hall he maybe drowns. Choose your death!
Guess, though, the Row has the better of the propo
sition, at that. As the old saw puts it, the child that
has been tubbed is afraid of the water.

Now this Distinctive Diploma controversy to the
comparative merits of Undisturbed Scholarship gives
me an excuse to run a little pome I wrote a couple of
years ago about returning warriors, and as many are
still here, the following is still partially true:
SENIORS
"These gents in sombreros and cords
Maybe seem to us mighty fine lords,"
Said a dink to a second dit-too,
"But it's only a few years away
When we'll be the mighty hoorey—•
You'll admit that my logic is true.
"So I feel we should never bow down
To a 'somb' as if it were a crown.
For though lowly we are we will rise,
Sev'ral years with our heads in a book
And the campus will see how we look
When we are attired likewise."
"If a couple of years you can stay.
Stick the books that you mention away."
Said the second dit-to to the first.
"Be a hero in war, though a 'lieut,'
And travel o'er Europe to boot,
See the world at its very best worst.
"Come back, get a wife and the rest,
Here the call of The Farm that's it's best
To get you your cherished degree,
Come back on the Quad for a while,
With a great big 'somb' and a smile —
Then you'll make a senior—maybe!

I am stifling—stifle then! —charge for the guns, he
said —Phi Bete and flunk, friend and foe, in one wild
riot blent —the sweltering, staggering mass of humanity
struggled onward. WORSE than the Black Hole of
Calcutta, the weaker were not only trampled under
foot but often were sent crashing down the high stairs
to lurid death far below. Many the men with heads
cracked, many the women with their hair-nets destroyed.
One sweet little lisp refrained from the maddening
crowd's ignoble strife. Along came the football eleven's
biggest brute. "Get mine," suggested two eyes. 16-42-
23-39-8 —and he hurled his mastodonic hulk against the
human sea. Over their heads he would make his way
but the resistance was too strong. A dive failing, he
hit the line hard and low, hoping his buffalo shoulders
would bore through. Twice he failed. Then enraged,
he picked off the men one by one, swung them above
his head and dashed them down the stairs to the floor
below. After half an hour of such havoc, he brought
back the paper. "Thank you. thir, you are irrethit
able, I wnth tho worried my thoritie thisthers would
thee my thamination firth and I juth knew I got a
mlnuth."
Oh, 1 forgot the time and place. Time: Any day al
most. Place: Returned (?) paper rack, second floor,

Now this Distinctive Diploma controversy to the
comparative merits of Undisturbed Scholarship gives
me an excuse to run a little pome I wrote a couple of
years ago about returning warriors, and as many are
still here, the following is still partially true:
SENIORS
"These gents in sombreros and cords
Maybe seem to us mighty fine lords,"
Said a dink to a second dit-too,
"But it's only a few years away
When we'll be the mighty hoorey—•
You'll admit that my logic is true.
"So I feel we should never bow down
To a 'somb' as if it were a crown.
For though lowly we are we will rise,
Sev'ral years with our heads in a book
And the campus will see how we look
When we are attired likewise."
"If a couple of years you can stay.
Stick the books that you mention away."
Said the second dit-to to the first.
"Be a hero in war, though a 'lieut,'
And travel o'er Europe to boot,
See the world at its very best worst.
"Come back, get a wife and the rest,
Here the call of The Farm that's it's best
To get you your cherished degree,
Come back on the Quad for a while,
With a great big 'somb' and a smile —
Then you'll make a senior—maybe!

I am stifling—stifle then! —charge for the guns, he

riot blent —the sweltering, staggering mass of humanity
struggled onward. WORSE than the Black Hole of
Calcutta, the weaker were not only trampled under
foot but often were sent crashing down the high stairs
to lurid death far below. Many the men with heads
cracked, many the women with their hair-nets destroyed.
One sweet little lisp refrained from the maddening
crowd's ignoble strife. Along came the football eleven's
biggest brute. "Get mine," suggested two eyes. 16-42-
23-39-8 —and he hurled his mastodonic hulk against the
human sea. Over their heads he would make his way
but the resistance was too strong. A dive failing, he
hit the line hard and low, hoping his buffalo shoulders
would bore through. Twice he failed. Then enraged,
he picked off the men one by one, swung them above
his head and dashed them down the stairs to the floor
below. After half an hour of such havoc, he brought
back the paper. "Thank you. thir, you are irrethit

A poor frosh won't know what to do any more. If he
goes Row he maybe gets burnt out; if he decides to
stay Hall he maybe drowns. Choose your death!
