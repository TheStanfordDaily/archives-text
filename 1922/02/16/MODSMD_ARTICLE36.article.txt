# WORK OF AUSTRIAN ARTIST ON DISPLAY AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
An unusual collection, exhibiting about
sixty etchings of scenes in Austria, Bel
gium. Denmark, and other picturesque
points of interest in Europe, went on dis
play yesterday afternoon at the Stanford
Memorial Art Gallery.
These etchings combine, in the charac
ter of their work, a remarkable vigor
and virility of technique with a rare
poetic interpretation. The prints are not
done as many people suppose, in ink, but
are of three different types, the aqua
tints (water color), line, and soft
ground. The aqua-tint etchings are made
by a dry powder ground in the ink, and
are generally discernible by half-tints.
One of the prints shows brown in the
foreground, while the lighter shades of
blue are seen in the background. The
soft-ground etchings are produced with
pencil over soft wax, resulting in granu
lar pencil-like lines, and lacking the
sharper, more accentuated lines of the
line etchings.
Before the war, the artist who pro
duced these etchings did them purely
for pleasure, giving them as gifts to her
friends, but since that time she has had
to do them for their remunerative value.
Therefore they may now be secured by
anyone at much less than the usual rate
for etchings, owing to the fact that the
present rate of exchange on Austrian
currency is so low.
Throughout European art centers,
great stress is laid on the production of
etchings, and this important line of art
work is coming rapidly to the front in
America. The interest at present is
quite strong in the East. ,
Mrs. Robert Reynolds of Palo Alto,
who has recently returned from a trip
to Austria, brought back this collection
with her. The exhibit will be at the art
gallery for two weeks.
