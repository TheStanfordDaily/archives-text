# INTRAMURAL WINNERS TO PLAY CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
A series of contests between intra
mural teams of Stanford and tlie Uni
versity of California were arranged for
by the athletic departments of the two
institutions in a conference last week.
The winners of the local intramural
basketball championship will tangle with
the victorious intramural five from across
the bay, and teams will also compete in
handball and volley-ball.
Next quarter it is planned to have a
game between the intramural baseball
nines, and a hockey match.
This intercollegiate competition is
made possible by the fact that the teams
will pay their own traveling expenses.
