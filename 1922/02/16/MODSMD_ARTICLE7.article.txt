# BERKELEY HIGH QUINTET BEATS YEARLING SQUAD
## Fast Prep School Team Wins One Point Victory; Babes Are Behind at Half, 3-17 
### 
For the second time in two years, a
team from the Berkeley High School has
j hung a defeat on Coach Seay's Babe
basket quintet. However, the Berkeley
men cannot derive as much satisfaction
from their 21-20 vctory last night as they
could from their 19-17 victory of one
year ago, for Coach Seay used his second
team for the entire first half.
Basketball enthusiasts, hoping to see
the tirst team in action for the last time
before the California game on Friday,
were disappointed when the weak second
string team took the floor. Their dis
appointment became more acute as the
small and aggressive prep men scored
goal after goal on long shots, while the
Stanford freshmen wandered aimlessly
about, waiting for the ball instead of
going after it.
At the start of the second half, Coach
Seay started bis speedy tirst team and a
'rwijbasketball game at the same time.
-Tim strong men were determined
to of the high school
team and tfie prep.men were as eager to
hold their own.
The third quarter was spent by both
teams in close guarding, with Alexander
and Driscoll getting but two shots at the
goal, both of which failed to fall
through the hoop. The fierce attacks of
the diminutive high school guards, who
were the real stars of the Berkeley line
up, resulted in live fouls on their team
during this quarter, three of which were
converted into points by Alexander. The
high school team went scoreless.
In the fourth quarter, with the score
7-17 against them, the Babes broke loose.
Alexander and Shipke, who were the
stars of the first-year team, did all the
scoring. Two field goals each by Shipke
