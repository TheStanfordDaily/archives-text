# ALUMNI TOSSERS DROP GAME TO SEAY'S COHORTS
## Varsity Sticksters Hit Lifur For Six Bingles While Vets Are Bagging a Meagre Two 
### Charles Prior, '23 
Tom Workman and his crew of
hoary diamond veterans were reminded
forcibly of their decreptitude when the
Cardinal Varsity compelled them to take
the small end of a 7 to 2 score in the
second contest of the season, staged oil
the local lot yesterday afternoon.
The Alumni drew the losing ticket
because they simply could not Hit the
offerings of Seay's slabsters and the
Cards walloped the pellet for six clcan
hits which all countcd big for scores.
Lifur, the "Vet" heaver, only managed
to strike out two men and was able to
hold Seay's proteges within reasonable
limits by the help of strong support from
his team. The Card • slabsters, Draper,
Nef, Kelly, and Lowenstein, had six
strikeouts to their credit. The two
Alumni bingles, off Nef and Kelly, were
only good for one base and one of those
was wasted.
In the opening frame, Draper took the
slab for the Cards. He sat the veterans
down in one-two-three order. Wood
ward led off for the Cards af}d was
thrown out at first by McCloskey. Pea
vcy singled to left. Heckendorf flew out
to Terry, and Ratner drove one to deep
left for a complete journey, bringing
Peavey in ahead of him for two tallies.
It was rather a bad start for the "grand
old men" of the diamond. •

In the second frame the Alumni failed
to make any headway, and Carver's
triple to left for the Varsity was wasted.
The third gave the Workmanites a tally,
as a result of two errors by Nef and
Peavey. Woodward got to third on
McCloskey's error and Peavey's long
fly to left brought in another marker for
the Cards.
McCroskey connected for a single in
the fourth but'died on the bases. The
rest of the fourth and all of the fifth
were quiet with both sides going down
in rapid succession.
Peavey led off in the sixth with his
second single to left. Heckendorf gave
Peavey the signal to go down and then
was unable to connect with a wide ball —
Peavey was out at second. "Lefty"
made first on Hayes' error and Ratner's
sacrifice put him on second. Maillot's
hit to right, which Kallam almost caught
but didn't, was the bingle which brought j
Heckendorf in the fourth marker.
Kelly got into a tight hole in the |
seventh between walking three men and j
Workman's single to center, but he
managed to crawl out with only one
tally chalked up against him. With
two out and the bases full, Kelly let
Kallarn trot to first, walking Workman
in for the second and final Alumni
score.
Lifur had almost a complete blow up
in the eighth and walked four men.
Between these four gifts. Terry's error
on Peavey's grounder, and Patterson's
hit to left, the Cards were able to run
in three scores, making the final score
of 7-2.
Because of the rain, which threatened
to prevent the game, thecrowdoffans
was more minus than plus. It almost
appeared that Athletic Director Powell,
Bill Fletcher, Dean Culver, "Dad" Moul
ton, Coach Templeton, and a few other
notables, were having a private game
put on for their special amusement. By
various means of coercion, the police
men were able to keep the crowd in
order and the automobles in their proper
places. Contrary to announcement,
Johnny Couch did not take the slab in
yesterday's game.
This afternoon the Alumni and "Cliff"
Ireland's cohorts are to fight it out for
honors. "Cliff" is here with his line of
world-beating wit and today's game
marks the thirtieth time that "little old
man of Cardinal baseball history"—old
in years but young in spirits—has made
the fans roar with laughter at his man
euvers and flow of humor on the coach

Tom Workman and his crew of
hoary diamond veterans were reminded
forcibly of their decreptitude when the
Cardinal Varsity compelled them to take
the small end of a 7 to 2 score in the
second contest of the season, staged oil
the local lot yesterday afternoon.
The Alumni drew the losing ticket
because they simply could not Hit the
offerings of Seay's slabsters and the
Cards walloped the pellet for six clcan
hits which all countcd big for scores.
Lifur, the "Vet" heaver, only managed
to strike out two men and was able to
hold Seay's proteges within reasonable
limits by the help of strong support from
his team. The Card • slabsters, Draper,
Nef, Kelly, and Lowenstein, had six
strikeouts to their credit. The two
Alumni bingles, off Nef and Kelly, were
only good for one base and one of those
was wasted.
In the opening frame, Draper took the
slab for the Cards. He sat the veterans
down in one-two-three order. Wood
ward led off for the Cards af}d was
thrown out at first by McCloskey. Pea
vcy singled to left. Heckendorf flew out
to Terry, and Ratner drove one to deep
left for a complete journey, bringing
Peavey in ahead of him for two tallies.
It was rather a bad start for the "grand
old men" of the diamond. •

In the second frame the Alumni failed
to make any headway, and Carver's
triple to left for the Varsity was wasted.
The third gave the Workmanites a tally,
as a result of two errors by Nef and
Peavey. Woodward got to third on
McCloskey's error and Peavey's long
fly to left brought in another marker for
the Cards.
McCroskey connected for a single in
the fourth but'died on the bases. The
rest of the fourth and all of the fifth
were quiet with both sides going down
in rapid succession.
Peavey led off in the sixth with his
second single to left. Heckendorf gave
Peavey the signal to go down and then
was unable to connect with a wide ball —
Peavey was out at second. "Lefty"
made first on Hayes' error and Ratner's
sacrifice put him on second. Maillot's
hit to right, which Kallam almost caught
but didn't, was the bingle which brought j
Heckendorf in the fourth marker.
Kelly got into a tight hole in the |
seventh between walking three men and j
Workman's single to center, but he
managed to crawl out with only one
tally chalked up against him. With
two out and the bases full, Kelly let
Kallarn trot to first, walking Workman
in for the second and final Alumni
score.
Lifur had almost a complete blow up
in the eighth and walked four men.
Between these four gifts. Terry's error
on Peavey's grounder, and Patterson's
hit to left, the Cards were able to run
in three scores, making the final score
of 7-2.
Because of the rain, which threatened
to prevent the game, thecrowdoffans
was more minus than plus. It almost
appeared that Athletic Director Powell,
Bill Fletcher, Dean Culver, "Dad" Moul
ton, Coach Templeton, and a few other
notables, were having a private game
put on for their special amusement. By
various means of coercion, the police
men were able to keep the crowd in
order and the automobles in their proper
places. Contrary to announcement,
Johnny Couch did not take the slab in
yesterday's game.
This afternoon the Alumni and "Cliff"
Ireland's cohorts are to fight it out for
honors. "Cliff" is here with his line of
world-beating wit and today's game
marks the thirtieth time that "little old
man of Cardinal baseball history"—old

Tom Workman and his crew of
hoary diamond veterans were reminded
forcibly of their decreptitude when the
Cardinal Varsity compelled them to take
the small end of a 7 to 2 score in the
second contest of the season, staged oil
the local lot yesterday afternoon.
The Alumni drew the losing ticket
because they simply could not Hit the
offerings of Seay's slabsters and the
Cards walloped the pellet for six clcan
hits which all countcd big for scores.
Lifur, the "Vet" heaver, only managed
to strike out two men and was able to
hold Seay's proteges within reasonable
limits by the help of strong support from
his team. The Card • slabsters, Draper,
Nef, Kelly, and Lowenstein, had six
strikeouts to their credit. The two
Alumni bingles, off Nef and Kelly, were
only good for one base and one of those
was wasted.
In the opening frame, Draper took the
slab for the Cards. He sat the veterans
down in one-two-three order. Wood
ward led off for the Cards af}d was
thrown out at first by McCloskey. Pea
vcy singled to left. Heckendorf flew out
to Terry, and Ratner drove one to deep
left for a complete journey, bringing
Peavey in ahead of him for two tallies.
It was rather a bad start for the "grand
old men" of the diamond. •

In the second frame the Alumni failed
to make any headway, and Carver's
triple to left for the Varsity was wasted.
The third gave the Workmanites a tally,
as a result of two errors by Nef and
Peavey. Woodward got to third on
McCloskey's error and Peavey's long
fly to left brought in another marker for
the Cards.
McCroskey connected for a single in
the fourth but'died on the bases. The
rest of the fourth and all of the fifth
were quiet with both sides going down
in rapid succession.
Peavey led off in the sixth with his
second single to left. Heckendorf gave
Peavey the signal to go down and then
was unable to connect with a wide ball —
Peavey was out at second. "Lefty"
made first on Hayes' error and Ratner's
sacrifice put him on second. Maillot's
hit to right, which Kallam almost caught
but didn't, was the bingle which brought j
Heckendorf in the fourth marker.
Kelly got into a tight hole in the |
seventh between walking three men and j
Workman's single to center, but he
managed to crawl out with only one
tally chalked up against him. With
two out and the bases full, Kelly let
Kallarn trot to first, walking Workman
in for the second and final Alumni
score.
Lifur had almost a complete blow up
in the eighth and walked four men.
Between these four gifts. Terry's error
on Peavey's grounder, and Patterson's
hit to left, the Cards were able to run
in three scores, making the final score
of 7-2.
Because of the rain, which threatened
to prevent the game, thecrowdoffans
was more minus than plus. It almost
appeared that Athletic Director Powell,
Bill Fletcher, Dean Culver, "Dad" Moul
ton, Coach Templeton, and a few other
notables, were having a private game
put on for their special amusement. By
various means of coercion, the police
men were able to keep the crowd in
order and the automobles in their proper
places. Contrary to announcement,
Johnny Couch did not take the slab in
yesterday's game.
This afternoon the Alumni and "Cliff"
Ireland's cohorts are to fight it out for
honors. "Cliff" is here with his line of
world-beating wit and today's game
marks the thirtieth time that "little old
man of Cardinal baseball history"—old
in years but young in spirits—has made
the fans roar with laughter at his man
euvers and flow of humor on the coach
ing line.
