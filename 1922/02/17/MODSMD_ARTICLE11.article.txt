# STANFORD AND OREGON FIVES MEET IN FINAL CONFERENCE GAMES HERE; FRESHMEN INVADE BERKELEY CAMPUS
## LEMON YELLOW ON UPGRADE FOLLO WING EARL DEFEATS; JANSSEN OUT OF CONTEST 
### 
Invading forccs from Eugene Oregon, chastened but not discouraged by
their successive defeats, and the defending Cardinal squad, still pursued by mis
fortune, will stage the finale of the 1922 basketball season at Stanford tonight
and tomorrow evening on the pavilion court.
Both the Lemon Yellow and Cardinal quintets have almost traversed the
routes laid out for them by the schedule-makers. 1 liree weeks ago Van Gent's *
men traveled to Eugene and defeated Oregon on its home court, but only l>y
two and three point margins.
Since that time the Webfooters have changed mightily. A month ago they
were a battered cage aggregation, swept from pillar to post by ever>* team that
went against them. In the past two weeks they have been on more on less of

i rampage. Members of the Lemon

fellow squad began to justify prophecics
made concerning them at the beginning
of the season. To prove the assertion
that they are capable basketball players,
the men from Eugene proceeded to hold
the strong California combination to 25
to 12 and 30 to 22 scores the first of
i this week.
Neither quintet will have an easy
time in the two battles here this week
end. Oregon is on the up grade, de
termined to experience the sensation for
once of walking off the floor the victor.
Sstanford is minus the services of a
capable center, Janssen, who is hors de
combat with the influenza. Piggott will
probably take his place.
Can the Cardinals repeat their early
season wins?
Can McHose break through the Ore
gon defense as he did before and run
up the score for the Cardinals? The
answer to the first question depends on
the second. If the "juvenile wonder",
as Oregon newspapers call him, can turn
the trick again, Stanford is in a good po
sition to win both games.
"Lefty" Rogers and Davies are favor
ed to start at the forward positions, with
McHose in the offing. Richmond and
De Groot will take care of the defensive
work for the Cardinal.
George Holder, brother of J. Fred
Bolder of Washington State, handles the
destinies of the invading court squad
and he takes care that none of his play
ers gets away without playing in the
game. The Webfoot coach, who is as
| well versed in the game as his brother
is, holds Rockey, his star forward, in
reserve and then puts him in the game
:at the critical moment.
Beller guard, and Zimmerman, cen
ter. with Rockey, are reported to do
the bulk of the work for the northern
| five.
The program will start tonight and
Saturday night at 7:15. The admission
is 35 cents for holders of student body
cards and 75 cents to others.
