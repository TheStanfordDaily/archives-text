# CARDINAL BABE FIVE FAVORITE OF DOPESTERS
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball team
will clash with the Blue and Gold
freshmen, tonight, in Harmon Gym
nasium, at 8:15 p.m.
For the first time in four years the
Stanford Babes are entering the annu
j al basketball series favorites over the r
ancient rivals. Unless the meage"
I dope that is available on the Cali
: fornia freshmen is unreliable, the
i game should end with the Bruin babes
on the short end of the score.

A brief review of the cuccefsses and
failures of the two teams reveals
much to the wise eye of the dopester.
They are basing their contentions on
these grounds:

Stanford has been defeated but twice
during the entire season, once near
the first of the year by a team ad
mittedly weaker, Commerce High
School, and the second time, last Wed
nesday night, in a game that was al
most hopeless, when the first-string
men were substituted for their weaker
team-mates.
In almost every other game, the
babes have come out with a comfort
able lead on their opponents, in spite
of many shifts in the line-up by Coach
Seay, in order that he might get a
line on his players.
California and Stanford have exactly
reversed their position of last year in
more than one respect. While the
Blue and Gold '24 quintet had a great
advantage in weight and reach over the
Cardinals, the exact opposite will be
true this year. Steele, aggressive
center, and Shipke and Oliva, running
and standing guards of Coach Seay's
team, have not met their match in
weight or speed this year, and will
not do so in the California freshmen,
unless California has some men that
have not yet been on the floor.
Last year California was in a po
sition to force the play, with the then
smaller Cardinal players on the de
fense most of the time. This year
there will be another reversal of form
here. Alexander and Hoffman are
both aggressive forwards, and have
developed a method of approach that,
in spite of the absence of Hoffman
from the floor for the larger part of
the season, is working better than any
other combination that Seay has.
Shipke at running guard is the most
aggressive offensive player on the
squad. His long shots, combined with
his ability to follow the ball will do
a good deal toward a Cardinal victory.
The Stanford babes are even strong
er in defense than in offense. Steele,
center, Shipke, guard, and Oliva under
the basket, have developed a blanket
defense that is almost impregnable.
The California team has defeated
six of the trans-bay high schools, and
the Concordia club, and has suffered
defeat at the early part of the sea
son from the Oakland Technical High
School team.
Kyte, center of the Bruin babes,
hailing from University High of Oak
land. Clement and Farral, forward, and
Buckley and Gooch, guards, are the
best bets of the Berkeley coach. Cle
ment and Kyte are the dangerous men
of the Bruin line-up, as they have a
reputation for long shots that are
valuable for tallies when needed.
Simons, Baker, and Tommey, for
wards. Schmeisner, center, and Kear
ney and Carson at guard positions, are
the best substitutes of the Bruin squad.
Stanford has the advantage accord
ing to the dope, and the babe team
has more than the requisite amount
of fight. At which statement the
dopesters settle back to rd
from across the bay.
j The preliminary to the Stanford
j California freshman game will be play
jed by the 130-pound teams. Almost
the same team which defeated the
Blue and Gold lightweights last year
will take the floor tonight. There is
no dope on the strength of the Cali
fornia squad, but judging from their
usual productions in the line of bask
etball teams, the contest should be a
good one.
Meyers, Hogle, Blosser, Silveira,
Koba and Young will start.
Admission will be twenty-five cents
for those with student body cards, and
seventy-five cents for those without.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 17. (Special
Dispatch)â€” With well sharpened claws
the first year Bruin basketball quintet
eagerly awaits the initial game of their
annual series with the Cardinal fresh
men to be played tonight at Berkeley.
From the showing made by both teams
this season, they will be evenly matched
and it will undoubtedly be the hardest
game yet played by either participant.
The fighting spirit exhibited by the
Bear yearlings to date should strengthen
materially their chances of winning, as
the contest promises to be a close que.
In the first game of the season the
Blue and Gold squad was beaten by two
points by the Oakland Tech quintet, but
since that time it has developed into a
smooth running machine and recently
gained revenge on the Oaklanders by
winning from them by a sixteen point
margin. Six local high schools and
Concordia Club are numbered among
the teams defeated by them.
The accurate shooting of D. Clement,
who played four years on the Colusa
High team, and of Farrar at standing
forward has been the means of winning
a good many of this year's games.
Kyte. former University High (Oak
land) star, has also annexed a good
share of baskets. Buckley, a product of
Sacred Heart of San Francisco, and a
member of the Olympic Club 145 pound
quintet in 1919, with Captain Jesse
Gooch has made it a hard proposition
for opponents to score.
