With this edition the editor bows himself out and
Volume 60 is ended. It is with a mingled feeling
of joy and regret that this last editorial is written —
j'ov at having had the opportunity to edit the Daily
for one term, and regret that the term had to come
to a close.
Many things have been advocated through these
columns during the past few months; things that we
firmly believed were for the benefit of the University.
Likewise, have we written against many things that
we believed were detrimental to the best interests of
the University. Right or wrong, we believed that our
actions were for Stanford's greatest good.
Each editor is prone to take his position too seri
ously at first. He is lifted from the ranks of the
reporters and placed in the executive position on
the staff. Whether the Daily appears every day,
with every bit of available campus news printed in it, j
whether the Daily "aids the cause that needs assist
ance and is against the thing that needs resistance,"
are two of the things that must be thought of each |
day. Facing the new problems that each day brings
forth, the editor may come to believe that a great
deal depends upon him. A mistake in the news
columns, the wrong editorial slant, the placing of
too much or too little emphasis on a favored project,
may cause a stop in the machinery of the University.
Seriously, he believes that everything he does must
be done with ultimate care lest the whole future of
the University be wrecked.
That is the attitude of mind acquired during the
first month. Then comes the abrupt realization that
perhaps it is not so. One editor after another has
come and gone. Evidences of their work is to be
found in the bound files of each volume in the Daily
office. Some were known as good editors and some
were not regarded so highly by the readers of the
paper. Nevertheless, the University continues to
progress and files of the Daily continue to be bound
in book form and shelved.
There is reason to wonder if Omar Khayyam, the
tentmaker, was not acquainted with college journal
ism. His immortal lines,
; "The moving finger writes
And, having writ, moves on",
seem to fit the position very nicely.
With these thoughts in mind we have tried to
keep a proper perspective of the Daily in its relation
to the campus and to the whole University, and to
laugh at ourselves whenever the serious mood
threatened. It is often laughable the importance
we allow to grow upon ourselves.
After all, it is the personal satisfaction to be de
rived from expending every atom of effort toward
the promotion of an object that is the reward. 11
the Daily has improved during the present volume
the credit should fall to the stall rather than to the
editor. The staff members did the work, the editor
merely supervised. If the Daily has not improved
the fault rests with the editor, for his supervision
was faulty and he lacked the drive necessary to
putting out a successful paper. ,
' While it is with regret that we punch out these
few last lines, we are happy to turn the job over
to Bill Evans. Evans has worked conscientiously
for the Daily since he first went on the stall and it
is due to his labors in the composing room that the
Daily appeared with a bright face and columns full
of news every afternoon. That he will be a good
editor there is no doubt, and \ olume 60 wishes
Volume 61 a prosperous and happy term.

the fault rests with the editor, for his supervision

Daily appeared with a bright face and columns full
of news every afternoon. That he will be a good

With this edition the editor bows himself out and
Volume 60 is ended. It is with a mingled feeling
of joy and regret that this last editorial is written —
j'ov at having had the opportunity to edit the Daily
for one term, and regret that the term had to come
to a close.
Many things have been advocated through these
columns during the past few months; things that we
firmly believed were for the benefit of the University.
Likewise, have we written against many things that
we believed were detrimental to the best interests of
the University. Right or wrong, we believed that our
actions were for Stanford's greatest good.
Each editor is prone to take his position too seri
ously at first. He is lifted from the ranks of the
reporters and placed in the executive position on
the staff. Whether the Daily appears every day,
with every bit of available campus news printed in it, j
whether the Daily "aids the cause that needs assist
ance and is against the thing that needs resistance,"
are two of the things that must be thought of each |
day. Facing the new problems that each day brings
forth, the editor may come to believe that a great
deal depends upon him. A mistake in the news
columns, the wrong editorial slant, the placing of
too much or too little emphasis on a favored project,
may cause a stop in the machinery of the University.
Seriously, he believes that everything he does must
be done with ultimate care lest the whole future of
the University be wrecked.
That is the attitude of mind acquired during the
first month. Then comes the abrupt realization that
perhaps it is not so. One editor after another has
come and gone. Evidences of their work is to be
found in the bound files of each volume in the Daily
office. Some were known as good editors and some
were not regarded so highly by the readers of the
paper. Nevertheless, the University continues to
progress and files of the Daily continue to be bound
in book form and shelved.
There is reason to wonder if Omar Khayyam, the
tentmaker, was not acquainted with college journal
ism. His immortal lines,
; "The moving finger writes
And, having writ, moves on",
seem to fit the position very nicely.
With these thoughts in mind we have tried to
keep a proper perspective of the Daily in its relation
to the campus and to the whole University, and to
laugh at ourselves whenever the serious mood
threatened. It is often laughable the importance
we allow to grow upon ourselves.
