# Self-Defense
## 
### 
The editor takes this opportunity to defend him
self while he still has the chance. His opinion on

the "flapper" situation was demanded by one of the
San Francisco journals.
What was printed was this: "I have never en
couraged a person whom I thought was describable
by the word." What he actually said was: "I have
never encountered a person whom 1 thought was,
describable by the word." He tried to be quoted
as saying what he honestly believes. How the mis
statement occurred can better be explained by one
v who claims he understands the intricacies of metro
politan journalism.
The editor, claiming to be of a somewhat shy and
retiring disposition, wishes to be believed when lie
says he was frightfully misquoted, lest he be chal
lenged by someone who believes she is a "flapper,"
and that for him would be a terrible predicament#
