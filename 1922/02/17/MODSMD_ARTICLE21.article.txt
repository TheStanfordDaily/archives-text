Hugo, the midnight moth, turned loose from the moth
ball when he handed us the following line:

Don't think an oyster leads a dull life. He is con
tinually getting roasted —if he manages to keep out of
a broil he gets into a stew or gets a raw real.

Philosophers often declare,
That there's nothing that is quite as rare,
As the bird that gets up in the wee little hours.
who goes hopping around and his breakfast devours,
But really, this isn't quite fair.

Who, safe in his warm little rug,
Must climb from his bed and get out in the morn.
To be food for a bird that would fatten on corn.
It is certainly wrong for the bug!

highbrow jobs ahead of time.

John kicked the bucket at the State's request, or whether
the preacher and a chicken did the job.

Babylon and "pretty baby" do not seem to go together.

Mary had a pretty face,
'Twas always white as snow.
Everywhere that Mary went,
Djer-Kiss was sure to go.

All Hail, Don Gaspar Portola. You gave your name
