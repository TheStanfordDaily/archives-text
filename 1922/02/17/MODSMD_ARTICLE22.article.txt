# NATIONAL COLLEGE ATHLETIC BODY TO HIT PROFESSIONALS
## 
### 
-wide investigation of col
legiate athletics is planned by the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association for
the purpose of doing away with pro- !
fessionalism and "other abuses that '
threaten incalculable harm to amateur
sports," according to Palmer E. Pierce,
president of the association.
The two hundred members of the as
sociation have been asked to approve a
plan whereby the Carnegie Foundation
will conduct an investigation of athletics
in American colleges, particularly as re
lates to the charges that, in order to
secure suitable athletes, the various in
stitutions are rendering them financial
assistance incompatable with amateur
standards. Nine district representatives
of the organization are reported as hav
ing declared that such an investigation
would be of great benefit in some dis
tricts and highly necessary in others.
