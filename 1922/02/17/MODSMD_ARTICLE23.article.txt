HARDING ACTS ON BONUS BILL
Harding has again taken the steer
ing wheel. He has asked Congress to
pass the soldier bonus bill, and to
raise the money by means of a general
sales tax. The stage is set for a battle
I of the first magnitude, for the Farm-
I ers' Bloc: and the Democrats have both
I lined up against the sales tax, and
the White House has been assured
that the measure cannot be passed.
It is therefore thought that the Presi
dent may be using the suggestion of
the sales tax as a means of again de
laying action on the bonus bill. The
tangled situation, in which Congress
is afraid to defeat the bonus and yet
afraid to levy taxes to put it into ef
fect, brings out the need for legisla
tive leadership from the White House,
and the tendency for the Constitu- ,
tional division of powers between the j
legislative and the executive branches |
to be overstepped.
THE FOUR POWER PACT
COMES UP
The Four Power Pact came up for
consideration by the Senate for the
first time when a resolution request
ing more information as to the nego
tiation of the agreement was passed,
j Neither Lodge nor Underwood, the
| erstwhel member of the -American i
j delegation, objected to the resolution,
j but they informed the Senate that
! they knew of no information that was
being withheld. For no minutes of
| committee meetings wore kept during
j ths Conference. In anticipation of the
; ratification of the Pact, which will
| guarantee the possession of Japan,
j England, United States and France to
I their insular holdings in the Pacific,
nd forbid the erection of new forti
fications thereon, plans are being made
for withdrawing the American military
forces from the Philippines.
REVOLT IN MEXICO QUELLED
A revolt in northern Mexico was
I nipped in the bud when General Ruiz
and Captain Perez, who tried to get
Villa to join them and lead a new
revolution, were captured and exe
cuted.
