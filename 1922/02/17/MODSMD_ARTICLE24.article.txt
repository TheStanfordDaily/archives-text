To witness the energy with which the
present Stanford students are attacking
the new Scholarship Committee regula
tions might lead a casual observer from
outside into the eroneous idea that the
opinion of the student body was a force»
to be considered by the Blue Law mak
-1 ers of the institution. Argument "about
it and about" hasn't seemed to have
made many of us come out by a differ
ent door from the one thru which we
entered—the door with the sign above
it—'"lt is the BUNK." Can't we get
some of the committee to go thru once
with us?
Leaving aside the oft challenged ef
ficacy of grade averages to measure in
telligence, some of the Stanford student
body cannot but raise the question that
intelligence, as measured-by grade aver
ages has formerly had quite its share of
incentive and approval and that earnest
endeavor and participation in the activ
ities of the college are entitled to the
official encouragement and aid of the
institution. Scholarships which require
a 2.00 average quite effectively elimin
ate the student who is working his way
thru collegt, whom, did he possess that
scholarship denied to him because he
works his way, might demonstrate a
claim to intelligence —even on a grade
average scheme of measurement. By
doing away with the "on pro" system
the Stanford athlete who has done so
much to bring Stanford before the pub
lic has had distinctions which were in
his favor wiped out from what is neces
sarily his end of the grade scale. Doubt
less the new regulations will offset this
by creating distinctions to his disfavor.
I read in an article which was written
in defense of the new regulations for
the survival of the super-fluous that
"other institutions of higher learning
have adopted this system". It used to
be that the legend of Leland Stanford,
Jr. University was "The-Winds of Free
dom Blow"—a motto indicating devo
tion to original thinking and action. Ap
parently we are in a period of transition
where our temporary motto might be
given as "Everybody's doing it." If we
are going to the jazz-hounds lets get
something more recent than that.

Editor, D. P. A. Sir: —Students who
foresee danger and injustice in the
new scholastic distinctions would do
well to glance over an article by Prof.
Wilbur C. Abbott of Harvard, which
appears in last November's "Atlantic."
There they will find a very interesting
exposition of how and why outside
activities have been encroaching more
and more upon studies in the contest
! for the college student's time. The
(ilief advantage possessed by the
former is the factor of competition.
Thus: "They offer him what youth con
tinually desires, a chance to try its
strength and skill with its fellows.
And his elders might perhaps con
sider that 'curriculum' once related to
a race rather than to something that
merely goes round and round. "If
public honors were once needed to
help athletics, journalism, etc., it is
scholarship which requires them now.
By itself, Phi Beta Kappa has proved
an insufficient or too limited reward,
and therefore, from the standpoint of
a remedy for this discrepancy, the
recent ruling appears quite commend
able.
It would of course be an ideal con
dition if, assuring ourselves that
"knowledge is its own reward," we
could abolish all sordid prizes, or pen
alties in all branches of student ac
tivity. Up to the present time, how
ever, supplementary practical stimuli
have been found necessary for the
pursuit of knowledge as well as of
virtue. If the editor has so much
faith in this principle, why does he
not cease to publish each evening, in
order of their standing, the names
of his reportorial staff, and. transform
ing the wtfrk into a class in News
Writing, awards merely +'s and —'s
to its members? And who do we not
abandon intercollegiate football jfor
classes in Swedish Gymnastics?
After all, everyone knows that aca
demic learning is not by any means
the sole constituent of a college edu

Editor, D. P. A. Sir: —Students who
foresee danger and injustice in the
new scholastic distinctions would do
well to glance over an article by Prof.
Wilbur C. Abbott of Harvard, which
appears in last November's "Atlantic."
There they will find a very interesting
exposition of how and why outside
activities have been encroaching more
and more upon studies in the contest
! for the college student's time. The
(ilief advantage possessed by the
former is the factor of competition.
Thus: "They offer him what youth con
tinually desires, a chance to try its
strength and skill with its fellows.
And his elders might perhaps con
sider that 'curriculum' once related to
a race rather than to something that
merely goes round and round. "If
public honors were once needed to
help athletics, journalism, etc., it is
scholarship which requires them now.
By itself, Phi Beta Kappa has proved
an insufficient or too limited reward,
and therefore, from the standpoint of
a remedy for this discrepancy, the
recent ruling appears quite commend
able.
It would of course be an ideal con
dition if, assuring ourselves that
"knowledge is its own reward," we
could abolish all sordid prizes, or pen
alties in all branches of student ac
tivity. Up to the present time, how
ever, supplementary practical stimuli
have been found necessary for the
pursuit of knowledge as well as of
virtue. If the editor has so much
faith in this principle, why does he
not cease to publish each evening, in
order of their standing, the names
of his reportorial staff, and. transform
ing the wtfrk into a class in News
Writing, awards merely +'s and —'s
to its members? And who do we not
abandon intercollegiate football jfor
classes in Swedish Gymnastics?
After all, everyone knows that aca
demic learning is not by any means
the sole constituent of a college edu
cation. Consequently, there is no
justification for, and slight probability
of the overestimation of any purely
scholastic honors which the faculty
may see fit to bestow. F. C. H., *23.

To witness the energy with which the
present Stanford students are attacking
the new Scholarship Committee regula
tions might lead a casual observer from
outside into the eroneous idea that the
opinion of the student body was a force»
to be considered by the Blue Law mak
-1 ers of the institution. Argument "about
it and about" hasn't seemed to have
made many of us come out by a differ
ent door from the one thru which we
entered—the door with the sign above
it—'"lt is the BUNK." Can't we get
some of the committee to go thru once
with us?
Leaving aside the oft challenged ef
ficacy of grade averages to measure in
telligence, some of the Stanford student
body cannot but raise the question that
intelligence, as measured-by grade aver
ages has formerly had quite its share of
incentive and approval and that earnest
endeavor and participation in the activ
ities of the college are entitled to the
official encouragement and aid of the
institution. Scholarships which require
a 2.00 average quite effectively elimin
ate the student who is working his way
thru collegt, whom, did he possess that
scholarship denied to him because he
works his way, might demonstrate a
claim to intelligence —even on a grade
average scheme of measurement. By
doing away with the "on pro" system
the Stanford athlete who has done so
much to bring Stanford before the pub
lic has had distinctions which were in
his favor wiped out from what is neces
sarily his end of the grade scale. Doubt
less the new regulations will offset this
by creating distinctions to his disfavor.
I read in an article which was written
in defense of the new regulations for
the survival of the super-fluous that
"other institutions of higher learning
have adopted this system". It used to
be that the legend of Leland Stanford,
Jr. University was "The-Winds of Free
dom Blow"—a motto indicating devo
tion to original thinking and action. Ap
parently we are in a period of transition
where our temporary motto might be
given as "Everybody's doing it." If we
are going to the jazz-hounds lets get
something more recent than that.
