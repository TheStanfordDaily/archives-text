The M. J. B. team lias a reputation up
in San Francisco of being an efficient
bunch of ball players, able to give any
nine an interesting time. They have
won several games around the bay re
gion, and make their first appearance on
Stanford grounds tomorrow. This will
be the third game which the varsity has
played since the season opened last Mon
day.

Included in the Coffe Kids' line-up
is Milt Stengraffe, who in the summtr
season gathers in lucrative pay pitching
for the Chicago White Sox. There is
also Sid Desmond, who plays left field
and draws his salary from the San
Francisco Seals. Galla, in left, is a new
Seals recruit. Two of the M. J. B.
men play in the San Joquain Valley
League, one comes from the Canadian
League, and the short stop, Dunning, is
an Olympic Club athlete. Joe Maher,
who will cover the third base, is well
known to college fans as tht man who
caused so much trouble to opposing
teams when playing for St. Mary's and
Santa Clara.
The varsity line-up is uncertain, as
Coach Seay has yet evolved a defin
ite combination for starting .the games.
From present indications, the game will
he a close one, and will furnish the
varsity a good opportunity to see how
developments are coming.
The freshmen will line up against
Palo Alto High School in their first
game of the season on the freshman
diamond tomorrow afternoon. Coach
Kallam has been drilling his charges all
week in the finer points of the game and
they should give a good account of
themselves. No definite line-up for the
game has been announced yet, and
Kallam will probably give all of his men
a chance to show what they can do be
fore the game is over. Bleachers to ac
commodate two hundred rooters have
been placed on the freshman diamod.
Palo Alto won the first game of the
season from the freshmen' last year and
the high school lads are coming with
the determination to repeat their per
formance. The freshmen are going into
to game intending to win their first start
and a good game should result.
