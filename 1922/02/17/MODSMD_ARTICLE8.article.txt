# MEDICAL LIBRARY GETS RARE BOOKS
## 
### 
More complete than any of its kind
! in the west, a collection on the his
' tory of medicine is being built up by
| the University in connection with its
| Medical Library in San Francisco,
j From a fund established by Dr. Adolph
Barkan, emeritus professor in the
Medical School, books are constantly
being purchased from this special
field. This fund is large enough to en
able the University to make this col
lection comprehensive and complete.
A 5000-volume donation from the
library of Dr. Ernest Seidel, a dis
tinguished physician of Meisen, Sax
ony, is the most recent and notable
item in this historical collection. Many
1 of these volumes are of extreme rari-
I ty. They are now being catalogued
| in the Lane Medical Library.
Dr. Barkan is himself now in Europe
| and giving his personal attention to
! the purchase of books for the medical
history library. The University has
I also secured the expert aid of Prof.
! Karl Sudhoff, head of the Institute of
j the History of Medicine at Leipzig, in
| finding and securing volumes from all
[ parts of Europe.
Dr. Seidel, a physician, became in
j terested in the history of medicine
while a young man and for forty years
| made this his special study, gathering
during this time one of the carefully
selected and well-rounded collections
of its size in existence. His,library
contains also many extremely rare
works, including manuscripts and in
cunabula, or books printed before
1500.
Otto Harrasovitz, of Leipzig, the ex
pert in old books through whom Stan
ford arranged the details of the pur
chase, calls especial attention to two
editions which he says are of especial
value as rarities. These are the vol
ume, "De Human! Corporis Fabrica,"
by Vesalius, 1557, and the "Libellus
de Romavandis Documentis," by Avi
cenna, published in Venice in 1547.
He writes:
"Dr. Seidel's library is the most
compendius and valuable collection
treating of the history of medicine I
know of."
This is the second gift of the sort
that Dr. Barkan has made to the Lane
Medical Library. He had before this
endowed it with $10,000 to maintain
a special collection, containing his
own library, on the ear, nose, and
throat, his own special subjects, as a
physician and teacher.
Stanford's medical library is the
finest in the West and the largest of
the sort possessed by any university
in the country.
