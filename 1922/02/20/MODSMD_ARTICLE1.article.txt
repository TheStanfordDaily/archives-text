# BLUE AND GOLD COURT FIVE WINS FROM CARDINAL BABES
## Steele Stars for Stanford Quintet As Fast Bruin Cubs Take Hard Fought Game by 30-21 Score 
### D.E. Liebendorfer, '24 
Playing a tight defensive, and a fast offensive game, the California freshmen
downed the Cardinal babe quintet 30-21 in a fast game at Harnnon Gymnasium
Friday night. From the outset, something appeared to be wrong with the Stanford
yearlings' machine. Signals did not work and their passes were intercepted and
their teamwork broken up repeatedly by the faster Blue and Gold team.
The Stanford babes took the lead in the first few minutes of play on a pretty
field goal by Alexander. California converted a free throw and the score was 2-1
in favor of the Cards. Field goals by Shipke and Steele gave them a lead of five
points, which the Bear cubs promptly reduced to two by a field and a free throw.
Hoffman added a point with a free throw. Three successive field goals by Kyte,
Buckley, and Farrar gave the California freshmen the lead, which they did not lose

at any time during the rest of the contest.
The half ended with the Blue and Gold
yearlings leading by a 14-11 margin.
The California freshmen started the
second half with a fast attack which
swept tht Stanford babes off their feet
and before the latter regained their bear
ings. the offensive had netted three field
goals. At this point, he Cardinal fresh
men began to look dangerous. Some of
their old fight seemed to return and they
ran up four field goals and a free throw
while California scored two field goals.
Here the Cardinal attack faltered, how
ever, and another offensive by the Cali
fornia freshmen netted them three field
baskets. The Cardinal babes could do
nothing to stem the tide and the game
ended in a well earned victory for the
Blue and Gold yearlings.
Alexander, who was the biggest point
winner for the Stanford freshmen,
scored three field goals and two free
throws. Hoffman, who was elected cap
tain of the team, reumed to the game
after an absence of several weeks owing
to an injured knee. He played an excel
lent defensive game and was always free
4o receive the ball, but seemed unable to
find ih<* basket on several occasions. Two
field baskets and a free throw gave him
second scoring honors for the Stanford
freshmen. Shipke, at running guard,
played the floor at all times and caused
the California forwards much trouble,
but failed to pass at critical moments,
prefering to take long shots at the basket,
two of which he made good. Oliva played
his usual hard fighting game at standing
ghard, but could not stop the fast Blue
and Gold forwards. Steele, the hard
fighting center, starred for the Cardinal
babes, playing a bang-up game on the
offensive and defensive. He made two
field goals from difficult angles.
Buckley, running guard, starred for the
Berkeley freshmen. He covered the floor
in truly sensational style, playing a won
derful defensive game and making three
field goals in addition to "feeding" re
peatedly to Clement, who was the high
point man of the game. Clement made
five field goals and two field throws.
Of their eleven free throws the Cali
fornia freshmen turned but two into
points. The Stanford babes fared better
in this department. Alexander converting
two and Hoffman converting one and
missing three.
The two teams will meet for the second
time in the pavilion Wednesday night,
and Coach Duffy Seay is preparing his
men for this contest, intending to win
by a decisive margin. With Hoffman
back in the game and going at top speed,
