### D.E. Liebendorfer, '24 
Playing a tight defensive, and a fast offensive game, the California freshmen
downed the Cardinal babe quintet 30-21 in a fast game at Harnnon Gymnasium
Friday night. From the outset, something appeared to be wrong with the Stanford
yearlings' machine. Signals did not work and their passes were intercepted and
their teamwork broken up repeatedly by the faster Blue and Gold team.
The Stanford babes took the lead in the first few minutes of play on a pretty
field goal by Alexander. California converted a free throw and the score was 2-1
in favor of the Cards. Field goals by Shipke and Steele gave them a lead of five

ran up four field goals and a free throw
while California scored two field goals.
Here the Cardinal attack faltered, how

baskets. The Cardinal babes could do
nothing to stem the tide and the game
ended in a well earned victory for the
Blue and Gold yearlings.
