## IRELAND'S INDEPENDENTS WIN CLOSE GAME OF BALL FROM ALUMNI IN TEN INNINGS 
### Charles Prior, '23 Carl Shoup, '24 
The M. J. B. Koft'ee Kids of San
Francisco swatted the pellet for three
hits and as many runs in the third in
ning of their tilt with the Stanford
varsity, on the local diamond, Satur
day afternoon, and defeated Seay's
proteges by a final score of 4 to 2.
Valla, center fielder for the Kids,
was the star with the fungo, driving
out four singles, and second bringing
in two of the four runs. "Doc" Way
land took the top position in the var
sity batting average,' getting three
blows in as many times to bat.
Out of the six hits which the visit
ors chalked up during Draper's five
innings on the slab for the varsity,
only four of them were clean drives,
the other two being scratches which
gave evidence that the "rabbit foot"
was on the side of the Kids. Clark
replaced Draper in the sixth and held
the Java makers to two blows and
one tally. Steengarth pitched a con
sistent game, and with the help of air
tight support was able to hold the
varsity down to five hits.
The weather was wrong for baseball
and with only about a hundred fans

Extra-inning devotees were served
their favorite dish Friday afternoon,
when Cliff Ireland's Independent's
nosed out. Tom Workman's Alumni
nine by a 2 to 1 score, in ten innings.
The game was in doubt up to the last
out. and the spectators present were
treated to an interesting exhibition of
baseball.
Johnny Couch pitched eight innings
for the Alumni, and during that time
allowed only five hits and one run.
Furthermore, he scored the Alumni's
only run, and made two hits out of
three times up. Ireland's men con
nected for a couple of long drives that
almost broke up the game, but Couch
managed to get out of the hole without
disastrous results. Kenny Nef pitched
the last two frames. Rock was the
hurler for the Independents for five
innings, allowing during that time one
run and two hits. Minook, who pitch
ed the last five frames, was nicked
for five safeties, but he kept them
scattered, so that no damage resulted.
The Alumni's only run came in the
second. Terry singled, and showing
a burst of speed, reached third on
scattered over the bleachers, the
game was slow, even the jargon of
the players themselves lacked the
usual enthusiasm.
In the first frame Valla hit a center
for the Kids but it failed to get re
sults. Woodward and Ratner annexed
a single each and Woodward crossed
the rubber for the first tally of the
game. Draper set the visitors down
one-two-three in the second, and Way
land hit to left for a single which
advanced Maillot to third. The Card
shortstop proved his worth as a base
runner by stealing home for the sec
ond score.
The third was that fallal inning
which gave the Coffeeites the game.
Kent hit to center and went to sec
ond on Steengarth's sacrifice. Corri
gan waited "Drape" out for a walk
and Kearns hit to right, scoring Kent.
Valla's blow to left put Corrigan and
Kearns across the plate for two more
markers. The varsity half of the
frame was quiet.
The fourth, fifth, and sixth innings
brought no results for either side.
Waylaiul tried to start a rally by lead
ing off with a hit to left in the fiffh
but he died on third. Clark took the
slab in the sixth and. in both the
sixth and seventh put the Kids down,
six in succession. Wayland garnered
in another single in the seventh and
got as far as third again.
For the visitors' final tally in the
ninth, Powell hit a single to left,
->le second, made third on Hecken
dorf's error and crossed the rubber
on Woodward's error. The Cards
were unable to do anything in their
half of the last frame and the game
was over.

Couch's single to right. Couch ad
vanced to second on the throw-in. Mc-
Closky tapped the hall to Rock, and
Terry was run down between third
and home. Couch was on third by this
time, and scored on Braden's long sac
rifice fly to right.
Cliff and his cohorts came back in
the sixth. Pinelli drove a triple to
deep left, and crossed the plate when
Ellison flew out to right. The run
that finished the game was garnered
in the tenth, without the aid of a hit.
Ireland struck out for the first time
that day, but Ritchie waited Nef out
and got a walk. A wild throw to first
and a wild pitch advanced Ritchie to
third. He scored from there on Pi
nelli's fly to center.
An added touch of the old-time
spirit was given by the presence of
Jack McCarthy, former Stanford base
ball coach, as umpire. McCarthy has
had a long record of umpiring behind
him, having been in the Bib Leagues
for many years. He was coach of the
Card baseball nines several years ago.
in the days of Wickersham, and other
Stanford baseball stars of that time.
He was also at one time coach of the
California nines. The speed and ef
ficiency with which the game was run
off was a tribute to McCarthy's umpir
ing.
Cliff Ireland fulfilled the expecta
tions of the fans who had come to hear
some witty comments and see some of
the old pepper. "Three and two? Very
critical! Very critical! Patient may
not live!" "Well, well —he found it
in his glove!" and other such com
ments are only samples of the running
line of machine-gun talk that Cliff
would let out at every opportunity.
