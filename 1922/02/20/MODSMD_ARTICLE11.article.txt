# CARDINAL TAKES FINAL GAMES FROM OREGON
## 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
Consider the Webfoot basketers from Oregon, settled for the season in the
cellar of the Pacific Coast Conference. They are earnest, conscientious young men
who make more noise, take more steps, do more passing than any other teamâ€”but
they don't win anjfgames.
I here are few who will contend, however, that the Lemon-Yellow aggregation
deserved any better fate than to be debited with its fifteenth and sixteenth suc
cessive defeats in the two games played on the pavilion court last week-end. Van
Gent's five captured the contest Friday night, 17 to 12, and the following evening
came back with increased strength for a 20 to 9 victory.
It puzzled the spectators for a time to find out the secret of the Oregon
attack. The answer was not long in coming. There wasn't any. Whatever scor
ing the Webfooters did was purely incidental to the main business of guarding

their goal with a live-man defense. Three
goals from the field on each night con
stituted the only damage done to the
Cardinal defense, which was itself in
good working order.
Games Are Slow
The initial contest was slow and un
exciting, made so by close guarding; the
second aftair was slower and still more
unexciting. The rearranged Cardinal
line-up, with DeGroot jumping at center,
hut actually playing standing guard, and
Anderson as center, swung into the lead
early in the game Friday night and was
never threatened.
"Lefty" Rogers sat in the session long
enough to play some good basketball and
cage a goal. Davis, Anderson, and Rich
mond made a field goal apiece, and the
first converted one foul throw. The
score at half was 9 to 4.
Things livened up in the second period.
Had Rockhey, the little Oregon forward,
converted more of the fouls called on
Stanford the outcome might have been
different. He missed seven out of thir
teen, while Davies threw three out of
three. With the count 16 to 8 against
them, the northerners started a rally.
Beller and Zimmerman accounted for
four points, but the Cardinal defense
tightened, and there was no further scor
ing except for a free throw by Davies.
Rogers replaced Anderson near the end
of the game, and he and Davies and Mc-
Hose were more successful in penetrat
ing the Lemon-Yellow defense than the
previous combination had been.
McHose Has Indian Sign
Nip McHose lost the Indian s'gn he
was supposed to have over the Web
footers in the first game, but he recovered
it the following night in time to hang it
on them good and plenty. Ten points
resulted from his elusiveness and ac
curate shooting, and he did not get a
chance to show his wares until the first
half was nearly over.
Bob Janssen. hardly recovered from
the attack of influenza which laid him
up last week, broke into the game long
enough Saturday evening to pull the
Cardinal out from behind.
Stanford Overcomes Oregon Lead
The Webfooters started as if they
might at last break into the "win" col
umn. Goals by Rockhey, Latham, and
Zimmerman and a free throw were suf
