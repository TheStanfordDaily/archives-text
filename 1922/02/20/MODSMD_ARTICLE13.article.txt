# CARDS AND OLYMPICS TIE IN SWIMMING MEET
## 
### 
1 he Cardinal varsity swimming team
battled the Olympic Club paddlers to a
tie score Saturday afternoon in the En
cina pool, each team gathering 34 points.
Lester Smith of the Olympics was the
individual star of the meet, making 11
points and participating in the relay. He
won the 100 and 220 yard free style
events and placed tliird in the 100 yard
breast stroke race.
Several of the members of the Cardinal
team have been ill during the last week
and for this reason did not display their
usual style. The Olympic Club was
weakened by not having Small and
Howell with them.
The diving was one of the features of
the meet, with White barely nosing out
Phil Patterson for first place. Snedden
took thfrd place.
Hawley, plunging for Stanford, cre
ated the sensation of the meet when he
went 68 feet. Coach Ernst Brandsten
has trained Hawley so that he is one of
the best plungers on the coast. With a
little more experience, Hawley gives
promise of breaking the Pacific coast
record. In practices during the last
week lie twice plunged slightly over 70
feet. Landis took second for Stanford,
while Larson added one point to the
Olympics' total by taking third.
Kegsky won the 66 yard back stroke
event in 47 seconds. Wafton, Stanford,
took second and Stoll, Olympic Club,
came in third. Watson was not quite up
to his usual form and Kegsky won easily.
The Winged "O" relay team proved to
ficient to give the Oregonians a 7 to 3
lead. Davits made all the points for
Stanford in the first half with two field
goals and a foul. Oregon led at half,
7 to 5.
1 hen Janssen, McHose, Davies, et al..
started. Time after time the fives were
deadlocked in the center of the court
only to have McHose slip through and
shoot a goal. Oregon had to be satisfied
with two free throws and with keeping
the Cardinal offense away from the
basket to a great extent.
Nothing Gentle About Second
Contest
Both teams were out for blood in the
final fray—and they got it. Several pri
vate feuds were carried on behind
Referee Wing's back, and many cases of
overguarding went by uncalled, Wing
evidently working on the theory that
what he didn't see wouldn't hurt him.
Rogers and Old Man Jinx had an
other meeting last Saturday night. The
forward was thrown heavily to the floor,
injuring the weak knee which kept him
out of the game in the early par of the
season. He may or may not be in shape
for the California game next Saturday.

Anderson; McHose for Rogers; Ander
son for Janssen.
Referee—Wing, St. Ignatius.
1 he Cardinal varsity swimming team
battled the Olympic Club paddlers to a
tie score Saturday afternoon in the En
cina pool, each team gathering 34 points.
Lester Smith of the Olympics was the
individual star of the meet, making 11
points and participating in the relay. He
won the 100 and 220 yard free style
events and placed tliird in the 100 yard
breast stroke race.
Several of the members of the Cardinal
team have been ill during the last week
and for this reason did not display their
usual style. The Olympic Club was
weakened by not having Small and
Howell with them.
The diving was one of the features of
the meet, with White barely nosing out
Phil Patterson for first place. Snedden
took thfrd place.
Hawley, plunging for Stanford, cre
ated the sensation of the meet when he
went 68 feet. Coach Ernst Brandsten
has trained Hawley so that he is one of
the best plungers on the coast. With a
little more experience, Hawley gives
promise of breaking the Pacific coast
record. In practices during the last
week lie twice plunged slightly over 70
feet. Landis took second for Stanford,
while Larson added one point to the
Olympics' total by taking third.
Kegsky won the 66 yard back stroke
event in 47 seconds. Wafton, Stanford,
took second and Stoll, Olympic Club,
came in third. Watson was not quite up
to his usual form and Kegsky won easily.
The Winged "O" relay team proved to
ficient to give the Oregonians a 7 to 3
lead. Davits made all the points for
Stanford in the first half with two field
goals and a foul. Oregon led at half,
7 to 5.
1 hen Janssen, McHose, Davies, et al..
started. Time after time the fives were
deadlocked in the center of the court
only to have McHose slip through and
shoot a goal. Oregon had to be satisfied
with two free throws and with keeping
the Cardinal offense away from the
basket to a great extent.
Nothing Gentle About Second
Contest
Both teams were out for blood in the
final fray—and they got it. Several pri
vate feuds were carried on behind
Referee Wing's back, and many cases of
overguarding went by uncalled, Wing
evidently working on the theory that
what he didn't see wouldn't hurt him.
Rogers and Old Man Jinx had an
other meeting last Saturday night. The
forward was thrown heavily to the floor,
injuring the weak knee which kept him
out of the game in the early par of the
season. He may or may not be in shape
for the California game next Saturday.
