Oakland High's swimming team
proved to he no match for the Cardinal
I tabes with the result that the freshmen
ran itp a score of 50 to 9 against their
bay city opponents. The freshmen did
not have their entire team in action as
several arc ill.
Belcher navigated the 220 yards in
2:58:4, which is only four-fifths of a
second slower than the Stanford-Cali
fornia freshmen record. Wright of the
Cardinal surprised the spectators when
he defeated his teammate, McCyllister,
in the 100 yard free style event. Both'
these men have been improving very
rapidly during the last few weeks of
practice. The freshmen made a clean
sweep of all places in the 100 yards breast
stroke with Gump leading to the finish
line in good time.
In the plunge the freshmen made an
other clean sweep of all places. Coach

plungers on his first-year team and
should alive little difficulty in defeating
all opponents in this event. The Babe
