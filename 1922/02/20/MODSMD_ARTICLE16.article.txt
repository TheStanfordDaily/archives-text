# THE 						NEW STAFF
## 
### 
Tom Irwin wilt he the managing' editor
of Volume sixty-one. Irwin lias heen one
of th,e most consistent men on the staff of
the Daily for the past two ytfars and has
handled all parts of the paper at different
times. He is the senior member of the
staff, and it is the policy of the Daily to
emphasize seniority whenever consistent
with ability. Irwin will have complete
charge of the composing end of the paper
and will exercise a supervisory power over
the desk editors on duty each day.
Bertha Yaughan succeeds Mary Jane
Clark as Women's Editor. Miss Yaughan
is one of the most active woman journal
ists on the campus and a thoroughly
efficient newspaper woman. She is serv
ing her third year on the Daily staff and
is well qualified to take charge of t»he
women's end of the paper. She will have
charge of all assignments of women on the
Daily and will handle most of the editorial
work in connection with women's activi
ties on the campus.
Something new in connection with the
Daily Palo Alto will be tried with this
volume, in the shape of a board of editors.
The main idea in instituting the board is
to keep those who have been editors of
the paper as an active part of the staff.
The new board will be for the present
made up of William F. Leiser, Harry
Borba. and Mary Jane Clark. They will
act in a more or less advisory capacity on
the staff and will hen council to which the
editor can turn for advice. All of the
board have been associated with the Daily
for several years and all are practically
agreed as to policy. With this sort of
arrangement it is hoped to keep the Daily
running steadily along without the shake
ups that are common at the inception of
each new term. In this way, also, the
objection may be avoided that, once hav
ing been an editor, a man has no more to
do with the staff or the paper.
• There are some other slight changes in
the nomenclature of the staff, such as the
substitution of "Desk Editor for "News
Editor," but these will make no difference
in the duties of the various offices.
