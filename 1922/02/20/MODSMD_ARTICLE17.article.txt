# TOO MUCH DISTINCTION
## 
### 
From the size of the rooting sections at
the baseball games on Friday and Satur
day afternoons it would seem that stu
dents have taken the matter of the new
qualified A. B. seriously to heart, and that
about ninety-nine per cent of the student
body has already gone out in earnest to
make a mark of nothing less than "great
distinction."
The alumni team was brought up here
from the South at considerable expense to
the University and a schedule arranged
for its two-day stay here. Cliff Ireland
and his squad, who always have been a
big drawing card on the Stanford campus,
come down to play the alumni and a small
handful of fans turn out to see the game.
It is disheartening to any team to play
before empty bleachers, the same as an
actor before a scattered house. If the

Varsity nine is going- to have a successful
season this year it will have to he sup
ported by the student body. Now is the
time to get behind the team, before the
season is advanced any further. A heavy
attendance at all the games will be a ben
efit to everyone concerned, the players
getting the encouragement and the fans
seeing some excellent baseball. We have
a good nine this year and it will do its part
to bring home the bacon if shown that all
hands are pulling for a big clean-up in
the season.
