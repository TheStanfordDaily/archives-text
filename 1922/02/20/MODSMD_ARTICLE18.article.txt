The Stanford quintet rallied in the last
half of the Oregon game Saturday night
and came out of a 7 to 5 hole with a total
of 20 to 9. The players didn't do it from
any inspiration by loyal supporters on the
sidelines, however. They went into the
second half without the help of individual
cries of approbation from the rooters and
fought with all their might, and came out
in fine shape, making a total of fifteen
points for the half, while Oregon was
garnering only two, and those on free
throws.
In the first half of the game, when the
Cardinals were having a hard time to get
started, the most noticeable call from the
sidelines was that of falsetto mockery at
the captain. Such cries might go over
well in some high schooj in the tall uncut,
but do not get anywhere here. Whoever
owns the voice of mockery which made
itself apparent on Saturday evening will
do well to have it operated upon, so that
he can come to the next game in the Cal
ifornia series and help nerve the team to
greater effort in order to make the series
go to three games instead of 2 to 0.
