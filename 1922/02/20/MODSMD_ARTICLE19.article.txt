Are you superstitious? If not, you should be. Every
body else is. For the benefit of the ignorant, there is
compiled below a list of potent superstitions for campus
men. (Of course, if you think you're not ignorant, just
pass over these):
• * *
1. If you throw a butcher knife over your shoulder
with your eyes closed when the prof is taking the roll,
the florist business is likely to experience a suddden
increase.
2. If a straight line appears on your returned paper,
it indicates that you are not very fond of some in
structor.
3. Should you receive no laundry bill for the month,
it is not a sign that the laundry company has overlooked
you. It means you did not send any laundry.
4. If you make a date for a Sunday picnic, it is a
sign that it is going to rain that day.
5. If you find it is very hard to get up some morn
ing, it indicates one of two things. If you decide to
get up, you will be given a cut in your eight o'clock.
If you decide to stay in bed, the prof wills pring an ex
on the class.
6. A black cat crossing your path means nothing un
less you've been eating at the Union for several weeks
steady. The sight' of a horse will affect you the same
way.
7. If you dream of getting quick service at the post
office, you should see a brain doctor.
8. And finally, if you want a chance to hunt for a
job, get sarcastic with the faculty.

Dear Sir: I don't quite yet get all this argument about
"With Great Distinction," etc. etc. What difference
does it make what's on a man's diploma? A business
man don't know whether "With Great Distinction"
means the guy did good in double-crossing the profs, or
whether it means something like "Graduated by Re
quest." You might say a guy that was booted out on
a bootleg charge left with great distinction. I'd rather
not have any incriminating evidence of MY imitation
sheepskin. If some poor sap wants to gather enough
honor points to get himself in bad, let him do it. aijd
let's not kick. Yours for poor marks and peace—

Dear Sir: I think thas atrocious row being raised
about "Great Distinction," is almost abominable, and
quite unfair to such of us of the upper strata as wish
to really better ourselves. I am in possession of many
honor points, and though I do nothing else but study, I
fail to see why anyone should complain if I receive
commendatory praise at commencement. Homer said:
"Hie saec omnibus glausuc, glycerine," which, translated
means, "if you do something better than anybody else
can do it, you ought to get credit for it." I agree with
Homer.

Toward the close of every quarter a flock of sheep
dot our picturesque campus. Here is a plea for those
students who are making the fatal step toward leaving.
Sheepskins are not too plentiful nowadays. Why not
tag each sheep so that a candidate could be sure of
his much coveted diploma? The flock could be driven
into the midst of the congregation during the commence
ment ceremony, and each lucky gent could pack his
sheep away "with or without distinction."

The medical library gets some rare books, according
to news item. Now they'll need the third million to take
care of the increased enrollment.

Dear Sir: I think thas atrocious row being raised
about "Great Distinction," is almost abominable, and
quite unfair to such of us of the upper strata as wish
to really better ourselves. I am in possession of many
honor points, and though I do nothing else but study, I
fail to see why anyone should complain if I receive
commendatory praise at commencement. Homer said:
"Hie saec omnibus glausuc, glycerine," which, translated
means, "if you do something better than anybody else
can do it, you ought to get credit for it." I agree with
Homer.

Toward the close of every quarter a flock of sheep
dot our picturesque campus. Here is a plea for those
students who are making the fatal step toward leaving.
Sheepskins are not too plentiful nowadays. Why not
tag each sheep so that a candidate could be sure of
his much coveted diploma? The flock could be driven
into the midst of the congregation during the commence
ment ceremony, and each lucky gent could pack his
sheep away "with or without distinction."

Are you superstitious? If not, you should be. Every
body else is. For the benefit of the ignorant, there is
compiled below a list of potent superstitions for campus
men. (Of course, if you think you're not ignorant, just
pass over these):
• * *
1. If you throw a butcher knife over your shoulder
with your eyes closed when the prof is taking the roll,
the florist business is likely to experience a suddden
increase.
2. If a straight line appears on your returned paper,
it indicates that you are not very fond of some in
structor.
3. Should you receive no laundry bill for the month,
it is not a sign that the laundry company has overlooked
you. It means you did not send any laundry.
4. If you make a date for a Sunday picnic, it is a
sign that it is going to rain that day.
5. If you find it is very hard to get up some morn
ing, it indicates one of two things. If you decide to
get up, you will be given a cut in your eight o'clock.
If you decide to stay in bed, the prof wills pring an ex
on the class.
6. A black cat crossing your path means nothing un
less you've been eating at the Union for several weeks
steady. The sight' of a horse will affect you the same
way.
7. If you dream of getting quick service at the post
office, you should see a brain doctor.
8. And finally, if you want a chance to hunt for a
job, get sarcastic with the faculty.
