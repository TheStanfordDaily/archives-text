# BABE DIAMOND SQUAD WINS FROM SEMI-PRO CLUB BY 18-1 SCORE
## 
### 
Coach Floyd Kallam's freshman
baseball team won its first game of
the season here Saturday, defeating
the Bernal Heights Winter League
team from San Francisco, 18 to 1, in
a game featured by heavy hitting.
The visitors failed to show much
and, after the fourth inning, when
the freshman wrecking crew got under
way there was no doubt as to the out
come of the game. Three of the San
Francisco team failed to show up and
three of Coach Kallam's men played in
the outfield for the semi-pro club.
The freshmen found Milder, who
started for the visitors for ten hits
and twelve runs in the first seven
innniugs. Riccomi, who took up the
burden in the eighth frame feared
little better, and the freshmen garner
ed four hits and six runs off him in
two innings. Johnson, the husky
freshman catcher was the heaviest
hitter of the game, connecting safely
four times in five times at bat. Dick
Lawson with two hits and four runs
headed the scoring list. The babes
played air-tight ball in the field, with
one error chalked up against them.
Follansbee pitched the first seven in
nings for the yearlings and allowed
but three hits, striking out four men.
Aydelotte relieved him in the eighth
inning and although a bit wild suc
ceeded in holding the San Francisco
team to one lone run.

Roberts. 2d; Johnson, c; Cuddeback,
