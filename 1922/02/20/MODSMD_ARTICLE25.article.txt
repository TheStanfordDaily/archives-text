UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eugene,
Ore., Feb. 20. (P. I. N. S.)â€”A definite
"co-ed code" which would be an ex
pression of the code of actions in
which university women believe, is
under consideration for adoption by
the University of Oregon Women's
League. The idea was suggested by
Mrs. George Garlinger, a regent of
the university. Correct decisions in
matters that arise in college life and
the training to guide one in taking
the "right crossroad" would be simpli
fied by such a code, she says.
