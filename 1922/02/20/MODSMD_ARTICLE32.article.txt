# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
FOUR POWER PACT
IN THE SENATE
The fight for the passage of the
treaties and conventions arrived at at
the Limitation of Armaments Confer
ence has begun in the Senate. The Ir
reconcilables seem to be looking
around for "reservations" to be pre
sented, while Senator Johnson of Cali
fornia has decided to turn to "ex
perts" for advice on the matter. Pre
sident Harding is expected to send
in the records of the negotiations re
garding the Four-Power Pact to the
Senate today.
IS FRANCE INSOLVENT?
The statement of M. Louis Louche
ur, the ex-minister for industrial re
construction of France, that France is
unable to meet its obligations has
caused a stir in the financial world.
This statement is taken as the fore
runner of a general reputation of
debts by France. Some senators have
tailed the attention of President Hard
ing to this fact, with a view, obviously,
to keeping it in mind when dealing
with the refunding of foreign debts.
SITUATION IN IRELAND
The Irish situation, though bad, has
improved sonsiderably. The ready
assent of Collins to Lloyd George's
proposal to appoint a commission to
fix the frontiers between the North
and south is a proof that Collins is
anxious to settle the diffence amic
ably. The DeValera faction, however,
seems to be determined to throw dif
ficulties in the way of the new gov
ernment.
