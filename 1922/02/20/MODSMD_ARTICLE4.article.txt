# REGION ONE ALUMNI START CAMPAIGN IN CAMPUS GATHERING
## Representatives From Three Counties Meet in Little Theatre to Discuss Work 
### 
Alumni endowment work was started
on Saturday in a gathering of 250 Stan
ford men and women from San Mateo,
Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties,
who met 011 the campus for the final pre
liminary to the campaign in District No.
1. The session in the Little Theater was
preceded by a tour of the University, in
which the party visited the Memorial
Church, the women's gymnasium, Roble
Hall, the engineering shops, library, and
Art Gallery.
"The minimum basis adopted by alumni
for giving was a five years' pledge equiv
alent to the tuition now paid for four
years, which amounts to approximately
$1200,'' said Lyman L. Pierce, director of
the First Million campaign. "Another
group of more means considered that it
costs the University in the neighborhood
of $750 to $800 a year to maintain a stu
dent, exclusive of tuition fees, and
signed their pledges for a sum equal to
four years at that rate, the pledges to be
paid over a live-year period of install
ments.
"All of this," said Pierce, "was to take
care of the natural feeling of indebted
ness to the University. The real giving
was to begin at the latter figure."
George Morell, vice-chairman of the
Palo Alto section, who was presiding,
announced that this plan had already
been adopted by alumni in his locality.
President Wilbur told of the differ
ence in the early financial condition of
this and other universities, explaining
that Stanford was started more as a pro
fessional school, having medicine, engi
neering, law, and like departments. This
made the upkeep greater at the start than
that of eastern universities, which
usually started with classical depart
ments, and added the professional de
partments later as side schools connected
with the main institution.
The president glimpsed the great de
velopment of the future which, he said,
was at present a dream, but with the fa
cilities and spaces on the campus would
Ibe possible later. He told of the quads
and additions which were anticipated be
ing st-arted when the second million came
inâ€”to be used for dormitories, libraries,
and medical buildings, which would carry
out the plan of the near future, and pre
dicted the development for a hundred
years.
When the University was founded, said
President Wilbur, there were no trans
portation facilities such as at present.
He related his coming to Stanford by
boat, and being driven to the grounds
by Jasper Paulsen, for many years the
bus driver between the campus and Palo
Alto. This man, said the president, had
called him up on Saturday morning and
asked to be put down for $1000 for the
endowment -fund.
Charles K. Field told of the numerous
gifts which should have gone to Stanford
in the past, but which were diverted be
cause of the general impression that
Stanford was not in need of funds. The
alumni, he said, were to be the connecting
link between the University and people
outside, and were to be the means of en
lightening the public on Stanford's real
condition.
Instances of the early days were re
lated by Field, especially of his maiden
speech in the Little Theater, then the
assembly hall. This speech, advocating
gold as the Stanford color, lasted for al
most one sentence.
Comptroller Roth told of the financial
status of the University, and indicated
that the facts regarding finances were
presented in the Illustrated Review, lay
ing everything before the alumni for in
spection.
It was decided at this session that final
reports from workers in each town were
to be turned in at meetings tomorrow.
It was planned to see as many of the
commuting population as possible yester
day. While the campaign is to extend
to Thursday, the work has been so dis
tributed that it is hoped to have it com
pleted by Tuesday noon.
