# MIDGETS DEFEAT CALIFORNIA QUINTET
## Bruins Lose, 25-23; Initial Game of P.A.A. Tourney Won by Lightweights, 49-36 
### 
Coach W. W. Young's 130-pound
quintet won two of their hardest games
over tlie week-end. California fell lie
fore the Cardinal machine, 25-23, St.
Joseph's A. C., 1921 champions of the
I'. A. A.and scheduled to win again this
year, were swamped under a 49-36 count.
Both games weiv characterized by ma
chine-like teamwork. To a large extent,
individual starring was eliminated and
the five worked together better than
they have ever done before. After a
long struggle the "lights" are hitting
their stride.
The California game was played on the
slippery floor of Harmon Gym. An en
tirely new combination took the floor.
Blosser and Sanford held down the for
ward positions, Hogl-e, of course, played
center, and Young and Silviera took care
of the basket. Hobro, Hollingsworth,
and Meyers also played.
Many of the California points were
made on free throws. Ruby, of the Blue
and Gold, converted nine out of four
teen free tries. Stanford only made four
shots good out of a number of tries, far
less than California's. Only seven fouls
were called on California. The referee
was Riebe.
Hogle played the most outstanding
game of all. Almost always lie got the
tip and started the combination working
toward the goal. Besides, lie seemed to
sink them from everywhere. Twelve
points are accountable to Hogle.
The next evening, Saturday, the first
game of the P. A. A. schedule was won
by the 130-pounders. St. Joseph's A. C..
all rigged out in brand new uniforms as'
befits the team which dope has selected
to play a long victorious season, stepped
out against them.
On the small floor, everybody took a
shot—and was successful for the most
part. Hobro and Blosser started the
game at forward, backed by the same trio
which played in the California contest.
This did not pan out as well as that of
the night before, for two members of the
team had gone over weight a little bit
over night, and the steam-room had
sapped their strength. Espeno, fast St.
Joseph's forward, continually slipped
through. When Meyers took Blosser's
place, Espeno's activity ceased and the
Cardinals began to gain. Hobro also
played.
Five minutes before half time the
Stanford five were on the short end of a
20-18 count. At half time they stood
ahead. 32-22.
The next game on the lightweight
schedule is against California, prelimi
nary to the freshman clash.

sapped their strength. Espeno, fast St.
Joseph's forward, continually slipped
through. When Meyers took Blosser's
place, Espeno's activity ceased and the
Cardinals began to gain. Hobro also
played.
Five minutes before half time the
Stanford five were on the short end of a
20-18 count. At half time they stood
ahead. 32-22.
The next game on the lightweight
schedule is against California, prelimi
nary to the freshman clash.
Coach W. W. Young's 130-pound
quintet won two of their hardest games
over tlie week-end. California fell lie
fore the Cardinal machine, 25-23, St.
Joseph's A. C., 1921 champions of the
I'. A. A.and scheduled to win again this
year, were swamped under a 49-36 count.
Both games weiv characterized by ma
chine-like teamwork. To a large extent,
individual starring was eliminated and
the five worked together better than
they have ever done before. After a
long struggle the "lights" are hitting
their stride.
The California game was played on the
slippery floor of Harmon Gym. An en
tirely new combination took the floor.
Blosser and Sanford held down the for
ward positions, Hogl-e, of course, played
center, and Young and Silviera took care
of the basket. Hobro, Hollingsworth,
and Meyers also played.
Many of the California points were
made on free throws. Ruby, of the Blue
and Gold, converted nine out of four
teen free tries. Stanford only made four
shots good out of a number of tries, far
less than California's. Only seven fouls
were called on California. The referee
was Riebe.
Hogle played the most outstanding
game of all. Almost always lie got the
tip and started the combination working
toward the goal. Besides, lie seemed to
sink them from everywhere. Twelve
points are accountable to Hogle.
The next evening, Saturday, the first
game of the P. A. A. schedule was won
by the 130-pounders. St. Joseph's A. C..
all rigged out in brand new uniforms as'
befits the team which dope has selected
to play a long victorious season, stepped
out against them.
On the small floor, everybody took a
shot—and was successful for the most
part. Hobro and Blosser started the
game at forward, backed by the same trio
which played in the California contest.
This did not pan out as well as that of
the night before, for two members of the
team had gone over weight a little bit
over night, and the steam-room had
sapped their strength. Espeno, fast St.
Joseph's forward, continually slipped
through. When Meyers took Blosser's
place, Espeno's activity ceased and the
Cardinals began to gain. Hobro also
played.
