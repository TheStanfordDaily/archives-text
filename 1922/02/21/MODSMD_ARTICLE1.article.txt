# IRELAND'S NINE MEETS VARSITY HERE TOMORROW
## Perennial "Cliff" Will Bring Strong Team to Test Early Season Strength of Cards 
### 
Cliff Ireland and his band of inde
pendent Independents will celebrate
Washington's Birthday by a diamond
battle with the varsity tomorrow aft
ernoon, at 3:00. This will be the
fourth game the varsity has played
this season, and will mark the first of
a three-game series with Ireland's
team.
The Independents will fu'rnisli plenty
of opposition to the varsity, as can be
seen by reviewing the showing the
former made against the strong'alum
ni nine last Friday. Cliff has been
busy perfecting his cohorts in what
little teamwork they lack, and the
presence of several league stars on
the squad assures good individual
playing.
Pep, life and ginger are always on
stock when Ireland gets on the field,
and fans in attendance at the game
tomorrow will be assured of getting
a liberal education in the way of
rapid-fire wit on the field. The quick
ness with which the game was run
off last Friday was in a way a tribute
to the snap which Ireland always suc
ceeds in instilling into his team.
This is the thirtieth year that Cliff
has brought his assorted team, changed
in personnel, but not in spirit, down
to the Stanford campus to test out
â™¦he early season strength of the var
sity. Ireland himself is still as active
as ever on the ball field, although he
does not carry around any spare
weight, and shows the advent of some
gray hairs. But he is still a young
ballplayer, and every once in a while
stages a grandstand play that would
bring applause even from an umpire.
Ireland will probably put his team
in the field with the same line-up that
was presented Friday against the
alumni. Coach Seay, on the other j
hand is still trying out different men j
at the various positions, and no fixed I
line-up for the varsity can be given
beforehand. There are several candi- j
dates waging close struggles for every j
position except possibly in the out
field, and these contests are showing I
up the most reliable men.
Wet weather has hindered consist- i
ent practice lately, and the varsity
did not work out on the field Monday.
This afternoon, weather permitting, a
practice on the diamond has been
scheduled. A few of the pitchers
have been working out a little during
the bad weather, to keep their arms !
in shape. All the hurling staff are in
good condition, and no recent acci
dents have occurred to mar, the catch
ing department, the infield, or the out
field.
