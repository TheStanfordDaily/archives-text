# LIGHTWEIGHT FIVE FAVORED TO WIN
## 130-Pound Squad is in Good Condition for Return Bout With Bear Five Tomorrow 
### 
Tomorrow night the midgets meet
California on tlie home court with one
victory to the good. A team which is
about one hundred per cent better than
that of last year will make the journey
from Berkeley. The comparison of the
two scores, this year's and last year's,
will indicate this best.
The Cardinal 130-pounders are just
hitting their stride. After a rather slip
shod preliminary season, which they
managed to light through undefeated,
they have at last comc out with a team.
Good, straight, co-operative basketball
won the lirst California game for the
lightweights, and they haven't forgotten
their stuff since then.
The Cardinal five is faster than a
25-2.3 score makes them appear. They
should do much better on a familiar
court. Since the last time the midgets
played here, they have settled on the
personnel of the first squad and have
perfected the combinations.
Blosser and Sanford will probably
start at the forward positions. 1 logic,
who has played a steadily good game at
center, did most of the scoring in the
lirst Bruin game and will no doubt con
tinue tomorrow night. Coach \V. W.
Young is back at running guard and
Captain Joe Silviera will continue at
standing guard. Hobro, Meyers, and
Hollingsworth aj-c a trio who have a
good chance of getting in.
The game will begin at 7:15 as a
preliminary to the Freshman contest.
