ly as possible an authentic account of

deals with Caesar's childhood and
youth. It is intended to present an

corded with as much of their grandeur
as possible. The death of Caesar at the
hands of his supposed friend Brutus
makes the climax of the production.

only as the great statesman who ac
complished feats of power and ability,
but also as a man who was led on by.

lirst man of the world of his dav.
