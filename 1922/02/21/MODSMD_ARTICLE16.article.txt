# TRYOUTS FOR W.A.A. PAGEANT CONTINUE DURING ENTIRE WEEK
## 
### 
Tryouts for chorus and individual
dancing parts in the Women's Athletic
Association pageant will be continued
during the week from four to six
o'clock in Roble Gymnasium. Emphasis
has been placed on the fact that women
do not need previous fancy dancing
training as a requirement for entering
tryouts. Tryouts will be judged en
tirely on ability to interpret parts ef
fectively and to work to the best ad
vantage with others.
Those wishing to try out for other
parts than dancing may do so next
quarter. A large number of places will
be open to those with dramatic ability.
The Central Committee and directors j
want it made clear that the pageant will
not be counted activity, so that women
are qualified to take part in it, though
they may have parts in other campus
dramatics during spring quarter.
