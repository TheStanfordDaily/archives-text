# PALO ALTO SETS $100,000 QUOTA FOR ENDOWMENT
## Fifty Workers in Chamber of Commerce Canvass Meet at Union to Start Campaign 
### 
"Outside of the great war drives
| Palo Alto has never engaged in a more
; important undertaking than the cam
paign for Stanford University," said
Alfred Seale, chairman of the endow
ment appeal in the business men's sec
i tion for Palo Alto, to the fifty captains
and lieutenants who attended the open
| ing campaign dinner in the Stanford
! Union last night. These men pledged
| themselves to secure $100,000 in the
I three-day canvass starting today.
"Those who are interested in the
city's welfare, economically, socially,
and in a business way," continued Mr.
Seale, "will see to it that the $100,000
quota taken tonight will be sub
scribed"
Comptroller Roth explained the need
for money as a result of the increased
cost of materials in proportion to per
sonal expenses, and the necessity of
expansion if Stanford is to maintain
her place in the front ranks of the
universities of the country.
"It is difficult to get great teachers
to leave the east, the center of learn
ing," he said, "to take the place of
our grand old men who have made the
enviable history of Stanford. There
are only four of the old guard remain
ing from the fifteen professors Dr.
Jordan brought here in the beginning
days. To secure men of as great
ability will require a much greater
salary.
"Tuition in the University of Chi
cago covers 42 per cent of its annual
budget. Tuition in Stanford covers
but 26 per cent."
The Comptroller announced that
three fraternities have already made
formal application for admission to
the group dormitories planned to be
built out of the funds from the second
million.
"Two hundred and fifty million dol
lars has been raised in the past few
years to add to the endowment of edu
cational institutions," Said Lyman L.
Pierce, director of the three million
dollar program.
"California in 1900 could count on
the fingers of one hand the number
of thousands of students in high
schools. Today there are 196,000. The
need for expansion in the building
progam, and the maintenance of a
standard of leadership, is obvious. The
high standard of Stanford, if main
tained, will enable her to pick the
cream in potential leadership of Cali
fornia and challenge the interest of the
students of the world.
"San Diego raised $125,000 to ad
vertise her climate; Los Angeles raised
$300,000, and San Francisco has a mil
lion dollar program to attract new
blood; Palo Alto cannot fail to raise
$100,000 to advartise Stanford Uni
versity, which has advertised without
stint its own home. Palo Alto and
Stanford are linked the world over.
"A by-product of the campaign will
be increased property values in resi
dences for people of means and cul
ture, and increased business along all
lines."
Report meetings of the Palo Alto
workers are to be held today and to
morrow at 4:30 in the Building and
Loan Association Board of Directors
room. A dinner report meeting will
be held in the Palo Alto Hotel, on
Thursday evening, at which time it
is hoped to have finished the list of
700 people selected to be interviewed.

need for expansion in the building
progam, and the maintenance of a
standard of leadership, is obvious. The
high standard of Stanford, if main
tained, will enable her to pick the
cream in potential leadership of Cali
fornia and challenge the interest of the
students of the world.
"San Diego raised $125,000 to ad
vertise her climate; Los Angeles raised
$300,000, and San Francisco has a mil
lion dollar program to attract new
blood; Palo Alto cannot fail to raise
$100,000 to advartise Stanford Uni
versity, which has advertised without
stint its own home. Palo Alto and
Stanford are linked the world over.
"A by-product of the campaign will
be increased property values in resi
dences for people of means and cul
ture, and increased business along all
lines."
Report meetings of the Palo Alto
workers are to be held today and to
morrow at 4:30 in the Building and
Loan Association Board of Directors
room. A dinner report meeting will
be held in the Palo Alto Hotel, on
Thursday evening, at which time it
is hoped to have finished the list of
700 people selected to be interviewed.
"Outside of the great war drives
| Palo Alto has never engaged in a more
; important undertaking than the cam
paign for Stanford University," said
Alfred Seale, chairman of the endow
ment appeal in the business men's sec
i tion for Palo Alto, to the fifty captains
and lieutenants who attended the open
| ing campaign dinner in the Stanford
! Union last night. These men pledged
| themselves to secure $100,000 in the
I three-day canvass starting today.
"Those who are interested in the
city's welfare, economically, socially,
and in a business way," continued Mr.
Seale, "will see to it that the $100,000
quota taken tonight will be sub
scribed"
Comptroller Roth explained the need
for money as a result of the increased
cost of materials in proportion to per
sonal expenses, and the necessity of
expansion if Stanford is to maintain
her place in the front ranks of the
universities of the country.
"It is difficult to get great teachers
to leave the east, the center of learn
ing," he said, "to take the place of
our grand old men who have made the
enviable history of Stanford. There
are only four of the old guard remain
ing from the fifteen professors Dr.
Jordan brought here in the beginning
days. To secure men of as great
ability will require a much greater
salary.
"Tuition in the University of Chi
cago covers 42 per cent of its annual
budget. Tuition in Stanford covers
but 26 per cent."
The Comptroller announced that
three fraternities have already made
formal application for admission to
the group dormitories planned to be
built out of the funds from the second
million.
"Two hundred and fifty million dol
lars has been raised in the past few
years to add to the endowment of edu
cational institutions," Said Lyman L.
Pierce, director of the three million
dollar program.
"California in 1900 could count on
the fingers of one hand the number
of thousands of students in high
schools. Today there are 196,000. The
