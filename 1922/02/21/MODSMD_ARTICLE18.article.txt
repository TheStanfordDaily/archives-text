## Fifty Workers in Chamber of Commerce Canvass Meet at Union to Start Campaign

"Outside of the great war drives
| Palo Alto has never engaged in a more
; important undertaking than the cam
paign for Stanford University," said
Alfred Seale, chairman of the endow
ment appeal in the business men's sec

The Comptroller announced that
three fraternities have already made

the group dormitories planned to be
built out of the funds from the second

years to add to the endowment of edu
cational institutions," Said Lyman L.
Pierce, director of the three million
dollar program.
"California in 1900 could count on
the fingers of one hand the number
of thousands of students in high
schools. Today there are 196,000. The
