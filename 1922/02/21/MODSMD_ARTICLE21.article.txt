# "CARDINAL! STANFORD! WOW!"

### 
Changing the names of team represent
ing the various colleges and universities of
the West seems to have developed into
something of a mania. A good many of
the rumors have been for the most part
founded on pure fiction, though, and the
student bodies most directly interested
have not had a chance to say whether or
not they have been in favor of the changes
that have been so broadly heralded as al
ready having been made.
Someone suggested the name of "Vi
kings" for the University of Washington's
athletic teams in place of "Sundodgers,"
and the press immediately accepted it as
if it were the chosen appellation and began
calling the athletes from the north the
"Vikings." This name appeared to sound
too much as if sailing and fishing were the
major sports of the university, so the stu
dent body did not accept the name at all,
but chose "Huskies" instead. This name
appeals to the northern students as more
fitting to their environment than the old
nickname of "Sundodger," because some
one suggested that the old name had some
thing to do with those who worked in the
dark and kept out of sight in the day time.
It is a question in the minds of many
whether "Huskies" has any meaning to
anybody outside those directly interested
at the university, and whether the old name
of "Sundodger," which has stood in the
north for the University of Washington,
did not mean quite a lot to those who know
of the shorter days which come to those
who dwell up there through the winter.
Now comes a letter from the Nevada
paper encouraging a campaign among the
colleges to choose nicknames by which
their athletic organizations may be known
when they represent the universities in
contests. Stanford, is spoken of as having
adopted the name "Indians" for its teams.
Stanford has been referred to by a good
many names in the last thirty years. Some
of these have stuck and others have skidded
and never again been heard of. "Red
Shirts" has been a name frequently used by
the press and has stuck through the stories
of Stanford teams. But among the many
the name "Cardinal" has been always first.
It comes directly from the cardinal that
has been the color of Stanford from the
founding in the same as the blue of
Old Eli has been made famous by Yale
teams for scores of years, or the Harvard
crimson.
The term "Indians" arises probably
from the idea of the Indian statue which
was expected to be placed at the head of
the Stadium. The sculpture as contem
plated was to be a group featuring an In
dian overcoming a grizzly bear. But the
allegory is not meant to extend so far as to
cause the Stanford teams to be called "In
dians." The Indian design on the varsity
blankets is put there as the design most
harmonious with the Cardinal red of Stan
ford. We are not "Indians." however, but
Stanford Cardinals, and as such will win
athletic contests with a good old ( ardinal
team. Stanford team. Wow!

ing the various colleges and universities of
the West seems to have developed into
something of a mania. A good many of
the rumors have been for the most part
founded on pure fiction, though, and the
student bodies most directly interested
have not had a chance to say whether or
not they have been in favor of the changes
that have been so broadly heralded as al
ready having been made.
Someone suggested the name of "Vi
kings" for the University of Washington's
athletic teams in place of "Sundodgers,"
and the press immediately accepted it as
if it were the chosen appellation and began
calling the athletes from the north the
"Vikings." This name appeared to sound
too much as if sailing and fishing were the
major sports of the university, so the stu
dent body did not accept the name at all,
but chose "Huskies" instead. This name
appeals to the northern students as more
fitting to their environment than the old
nickname of "Sundodger," because some
one suggested that the old name had some
thing to do with those who worked in the
dark and kept out of sight in the day time.
It is a question in the minds of many
whether "Huskies" has any meaning to
anybody outside those directly interested
at the university, and whether the old name
of "Sundodger," which has stood in the
north for the University of Washington,
did not mean quite a lot to those who know
of the shorter days which come to those
who dwell up there through the winter.
Now comes a letter from the Nevada
paper encouraging a campaign among the
colleges to choose nicknames by which
their athletic organizations may be known
when they represent the universities in
contests. Stanford, is spoken of as having
adopted the name "Indians" for its teams.
Stanford has been referred to by a good
many names in the last thirty years. Some
of these have stuck and others have skidded
and never again been heard of. "Red
Shirts" has been a name frequently used by
the press and has stuck through the stories
of Stanford teams. But among the many
the name "Cardinal" has been always first.
It comes directly from the cardinal that
has been the color of Stanford from the
founding in the same as the blue of
Old Eli has been made famous by Yale
teams for scores of years, or the Harvard
crimson.
The term "Indians" arises probably
from the idea of the Indian statue which
was expected to be placed at the head of
the Stadium. The sculpture as contem
plated was to be a group featuring an In
dian overcoming a grizzly bear. But the
allegory is not meant to extend so far as to
cause the Stanford teams to be called "In
dians." The Indian design on the varsity
blankets is put there as the design most
harmonious with the Cardinal red of Stan
ford. We are not "Indians." however, but
Stanford Cardinals, and as such will win
athletic contests with a good old ( ardinal
team. Stanford team. Wow!
