Cabbages crave recognition. Too long have politics,
snakes, dramatics, sports, professors and the like clog
ged this column. We a-e out to gladden the heart of
William Randolph. We are going to write about the
flappers—Beers to 'em.

Stupendous preparations were made before conduct
ing investigations. A personal letter was sent to every
body in a position of authority, requesting them for a
definition of "Flapper." Some are reproduced below.

Cabbages:—ln my capacity as an authority on word
derivations, I should spy that it meant an object which
had something to do with flaps. I can only think of
flaps on envelopes and birds at present. No doubt you
will find some other interpretation which will perhaps
fit more aptly. PROF. ESSOR.
* * *
You're right professor, most of them sure are birds.
* * *
My dear sir:—'How can you attach "flapper" to a
young woman? It is utterly foreign to their nature,
as I know them. You know, it's absolutely ludicrous,
Haw, haw, haw, to think of an alluring young thing as
a deep-sea turtle's fin. I refer you to Mr. Webster's
volume. PAULL MAULL.
* * •
Sir:—Are you trying to insult me? VERA GUID.
• * e
Oh, you silly thing. Don't you really know what a
flapper is? I though everybody read the Examiner.
Why, a flapper is a miss whose braids flap behind her.
Just like mother's when she tucks you to sleep.
MRS. ASGOOD ASA MILE.
'S 'at right, ma?

Really, you know, I have too much at stake.

Cabbages:—l only know that all of my sisters are
nice girls. SARAH ROSIS.
* * *
Dearest Cabsy:—You know, I just can't write it but
I'd love to give you all the information I have at —well,
call 1471 some day. Ta-ta.
* * *
Yah, they're all flappers. Bring your Climax to class
tomorrow. HARDAN HARDY.

These are samples from the sacks of mail which
clogged the post-office all last week. After carefully
studying the definitions, our special correspondent com
piled the following statistics between his ten and eleven
o'clock classes:

ENGINEER'S CORNER. ELEVEN O'CLOCK
Out of possible fifty-two, I, and a chosen few to serve
as collaborators, found that thirty were bona-fide flap
pers; twenty-one were plain co-eds, and one, my girl,
was both beautiful and heady.
Of the thirty flappers, one was selected because her
shoe needed halt'-soling; two others were classed as
flappers because their jaws flapped though they said
nothing. Fifteen were plainly not unconscious, and the
rest were as homely as a deep-sea turtle's fin. so were
doubtless flappers.

ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
Now is the time, men, to take action against this con
dition. Flappers have become a nuisance. One cannot
pick up a paper without discovering that although some
body does not know of any, he is agin 'em. If the re
port is true that the alleged flapper is all wool and
several yards wide (this is a blanket statement), why
worry. Can you blame people for being driven flappy.
If it is inevitable, let us make the best of the mess.
Although the noise of flapping echoes in sleep, as it
goes about knitting up ravelled sleeves, remember, he
who is flapped hardest learns quickets.
V. U. POINT,

Wonder who the varsity nine will play next? Evi
dently the Koffee Kids didn't need the home grounds.
Next we'll have the S. F. Tanglefoot Nine. They're
sure death on flies. If the San Bruno Ragpickers' Local
86 comes down to the battle, the managerial tryoutees
will have to keep an eye on the bags.

THIS LOOKS LIKE AN END LINE BUT ITS KNOT.
