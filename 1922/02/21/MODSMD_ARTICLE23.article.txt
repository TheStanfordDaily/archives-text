Tomorrow we celebrate the one hundred
and ninetieth birthday of George Wash
ington, still considered after all these years
as America's foremost son. He has been
known in the pages of fiction and history
as "Father of His Country," the leading
American, and by many other endearing
and reverential names.
George Washington was primarily what
many men are today, a loyal American at
heart, with the good of his country first in
his mind always. But he was in addition,
what only a few of us can be, because we
lack the quality of leadership which Wash
ington possessed. He had the ability to
put his views before his associates in such
a manner that he was followed and adhered
to in time of need even by those who were
not in complete harmony with his plans.
When we are taking a holiday from la
bor tomorrow we will do well to think for
a moment on the nature of the nian whose
name has come down to us as meaning so
much when one speaks of leadership, and
kindness withal, as synonymous with
Americanism.
