# Stanford is Compared to Princeton by Secretary
## 
### 
Stanford and Princeton have much
in common, in the opinion of H. Alex
ander Smith, executive secretary of
Princeton, who recently visited Stan
ford in the course of a tour of inspec
tion of American universities.
Smith and Dr. Wilbur were closely
associated in the work of the Food Ad
ministration during the war and in a
letter to President Wilbur, after his
visit to Stanford, Smith says:
"1 believe that men wno come from
such universities as Stanford and
Princeton must have moral vision as
well as intellectual power. The very
large places will have difficulty in add
ing this all-important touch."
