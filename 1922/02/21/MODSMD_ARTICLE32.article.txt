Davies lias been turning the fouls

J Mary's game, ind in the first conflict
with Oregon.

The Oregonians have 110 permanent
; captain this season but elect an acting
field-leader before each game. Itockney,
the flashy forward, drew the joker in
I both of the contests here.

Too much of a good thing, thought
University of Washington basketball
followers when they learned that the
Huskies were slated for another ser
ies with the Cougars, whom they had
beaten in four straight games already.
The Cougars played dead in the first
contest of the latest series, according
to custom, but last Saturday night
they refused to be trampled 011 any
longer. When the Washington five re
covered from the shock they were
nursing a 30' to 20 defeat.
j» * *
The Blue and Gold basketers effect
ively put a crimp in whatever cham
i pionship aspirations the Trojan five
from U. S. C. may have harbored with
their four game conference schedule.
Wight's tossers downed the southern
(rs twice last week-end and will travel
to Los Angeles next week to try and
repeat the dose.

If the varsity squad can remain
untouched by any more illness or in
jury, the Cardinal quintet should have
an even chance to turn the tables on
the Blue and Gold outfit, notwith
standing the fact that the game will
be played at Oakland. Rogers, Davies
and McHose are the trio that can score
points in almost any man's league.
The return of Janssen to center, with
DeGroot and Richmond fit, makes the
outlook brighter than before the open
' ing game with the Bruins.
* * *
If Duffy Seay's freshman cage team
j can trample on the Bruin cubs to
morrow night, it will be doihg some
thing no first-year team has accomp
lished for a long time. Playing on
their home court should make a differ
ence to the Card yearlings. Half the
task appears to be in smothering Cle
ment, the "feed man" of the Blue and
Gold quintet.
