# DELTA UPSILON FIVE WINS LEAGUE FOUR
## 
### 
League four's championship basket.-
j ball plaque was captured yesterday
| by Delta Upsilon, in a fast court bout
i with the Kappa Sigma five, 17-6. These
! two teams were tied for first place.
The winners had superior team
work and accuracy in basket-shooting,
and, to cap the climax, the work of
their pair of guards was excellent. In
fact all members of both teams enter
ed into the defensive game with the
evident purpose of getting the ball or
somebody's scalp. Resounding smacks
were numerous. Farish, Kappa Sigma
center, and Atwill, running guard for
D. U., were usually to be found among
those present in the fray. A good
start gave the winners the lead at half
time, 10-5.
Lacey, Delta L T psilon, was the best
forward on the floor, and accounted
for three field goals, and made good
five out of six free throws. Atwill,
stellar running guard, looped two long
shots from mid-court. Relnhold made
one field goal. Black, center, and At
will and Green, guards, formed a
strong defense. The D. U. five used no
substitutes.
Hood scored all points for Kappa
Sigma. Eskew, the other forward, has
usually been fairly accurate, but in
this contest he was unable to find
the basket. Eskew and Farish direct
ed their energies towards gaining the
elusive casaba. Smurr was a battling
bulwark at standing guard.
Just before the end of the game,
Lacey put in a pretty toss from the
middle of the court. Throughout the
contest plenty of rooting support was
furnished by an exuberant crowd of
partisans.
This afternoon, at 4:20 the first and
probably the hardest round of the
championship series was played by
Alpha Delta Phi and Alpha Kappa
Lambda. At 5 p.m. Phi Kappa Sig
ma is scheduled to meet Theta Chi.
