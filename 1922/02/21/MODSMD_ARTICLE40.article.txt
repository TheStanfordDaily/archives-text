# Y.W.C.A. CONFERENCE POSTPONED TO APRIL
## 
### 
Owing to the prevalence of influenza
at Mills College the Y. W. C. A. mid
winter conference which was schedul
ed to meet at Stanford, February 24
to 26, has been postponed until the
first week in April. The type of in
llenza at Mills is more serious than
that on the campus and the conference
committee thought it wiser to post
pone the conference than run the
risks which would result from lodging
the conference representatives in the
living groups.
