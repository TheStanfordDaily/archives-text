## 
### 
Elimination matches in wrestling will
be started Friday in preparation for the
bont with California, which is scheduled
for March 7th at Berkeley, according to
Coach Harry Maloney. *
The team, believes Vaughn Hosepian,
wrestling instructor, will be stronger
this year than last, for there arc two
good men in each weight class com
peting for the initial performance. Sturm
and Fleming will settle on Friday just
who is to represent the 125-pounders.
The latter was a member of last year's
team, but Sturm, though weighing only
118 pounds, has shown aggressiveness
and speed in practice.
There are three contenders for the
135-pound class—Hosepian, Brazil, and
L. Smith. Hosepian has not yet been
defeated, and there is little chance that
either of the other men will be able
to displace him. Mercer and Montgom
ery, 145-pounders, appear to be fairly
evenly matched, but Mercer's greater
experience gives him a slight edge over
bis opponent. Boyle, Johnson, and
Nave are the three contenders of tht
158-pound class. The outcome of the
elimination can only tell which man
will represent this weight. Of the 175-
pounders, McKee, because of greater
experience, is conceded to have the ad
vantage over his opponent, Leh.
