# CARDINAL FRESHMEN MEET BRUIN CUBS IN PAVILION TOMORROW
## Saturday's Winners will Meet Stiff Opposition in Second Game 
### 
A Cardinal freshman basketball team, out for revenge, will clash with the babe
team from Berkeley tomorrow evening in the Pavilion in an attempt to take the
second game of the series with the Bruin babes.
The freshmen will have the advantage in this second game of playing on their
home court, and also will have the service of Hooper, speedy running guard, who
was out of the first game because of a cold.
Those who have been following the ins and outs of the Cardinal Babes through
last season are expecting a reversal of form in this second game that will make
third contest necessary. The husky first-year men are waiting impatiently for
the referee's whistle to give them a chance to retrieve their honors in the indoor
sport.
It is almost a certainty that Coach Seay will start the same combination to
morrow night that played the Bruins on Saturday. Hoffman and Alexander at
forward have proved themselves to be the most efficient scoring machine that has

yet taken the floor this season, and, with
Driscoll and Hooper in reserve, this end
ol tlie floor should be well taken care of.
Steele at center lias been the find of
the season. Making a poor start in the
first few games, lie has lately developed
into the most aggressive defensive play
er of the first-year squad, and. with
Harry Shipkcy at running guard, throws
a blanket defense around the basket thai
is the despair of the opposing forwards.
However, both these men were ex
periencing difficulty last Saturday in
guarding the California forwards, as the
slippery condition of the floor made it
impossible for them to change direction
as easily as their lighter opponents.
Oliva, the "Freddy Adams" of the
1925 quintet, completes the team at
standing guard. Oliva has both the
build and the knowledge of basketball
for his position.
For California, Clement and Farrar
will hold down forward positions, with
Kvte at center and Buckley and Gooch
at guard.
Buckley and Clement are the danger
ous men of the California squad, both
of them having ability in long shots
from all angles of the court.
Coach Seay was absent from his ac
customed post in the Pavilion last night,
and practice was handled by Captain
Hoffman. Light signal practice and
basket shooting occupied the entire
evening. Tonight the squad will hold
another light workout in preparation for
the game Wednesday.
