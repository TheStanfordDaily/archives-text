# CARDINALS TO MEET CALIFORNIA SOCCER SQUAD AT BERKELEY
## 
### 
Cardinal soccer players will seek Gold
and Blue competition when the Stan
lord kickers journey over to Berkeley
on Washington's birthday. Not that the
varsity expects to find easy pickings,
because of late the team has had some
of its best players on the sick list, and
Coach Harry Maloney lias had difficulty
in finding a working combination.
In order to keep the lead in the Uni
versity and Club League, it will be neces
sary for the varsity to take this game,
as it dropped one to the Palo Alto
American Legion last Saturday, and
now leads the league by a margin of
one point. This is the first game that
any of Harry Maloney's varsities have
lost for two years. One of the stir
prises of the game was Onions, Cali
fornia soccer coach, playing center half
for the ex-soldiers.
The varsity will meet at the South
ern Pacific station in order to take
the 9:15 train.
