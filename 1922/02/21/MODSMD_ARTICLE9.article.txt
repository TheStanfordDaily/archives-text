# LICK-WILMERDING TO OPPOSE BABE MERMEN
## 
### 
The freshman mermen will swim
against the Lick-Wilmerding High team
in the Encina pool at 10:15 tomorrow.
1 lie San Francisco school has been a
close contender for championship honors
in the northern part of the state and
should give the babes some real com
petition for first honors. Walter Mills,
a member of the high school team, was
formerly Pacific Coast diving champion.
The Cardinal babes will not have
Captain Klebahn to compete for them
in the sprints and relay. Illness will
also keep several other men out of com
petition for a short while.
