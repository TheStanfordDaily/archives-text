# CLIFF IRELAND’S NINE SCORES WIN OVER SEATS MEN
## Game in Doubt Until Last Out Is Made; Thrills Furnished by Rallies in Ninth Inning 
### Carl Shoup, ’24 
Cliff Ireland and his baseball cohorts
paid their respects to the varsity nine yes
terday afternoon by nosing out ahead,
3-2, in as tight a diamond battle as can
be seen in any league. The score was
knotted at 2-all up to the ninth inning,
when the Independents, by a combination
of hitting the ball and getting hit them
selves, got the winning tally across. A
rally by the varsity in the last half of the
inning furnished excitement but no re
sults, and the invaders went home with
the first of the three-game series safely
tucked away.
The main causes of the Independents'
success were the pitching of Rock—who
is to be given a chance with the San
Francisco Seals this summer—and the
support that-he received in the pinches.
Five out of the nine innings the varsity
batters were retired in one, two, three
order, while neither of the varsity
pitchers, Lowenstein and Kelly, could
work the same trick on Ireland's men at
any time. The support afforded by the
infield was erratic, sometimes putting the
pitcher in a hole and sometimes pulling
him out of one. Patterson and Maillot
worked a couple of fast double plays,
each time on Cliff Ireland himself. Cliff
would plunk one down the first base line,
with Minook already on the initial sack,
and then it would be a case of Patterson
to Maillot to Patterson, with two outs
registered.
Lowenstein started in the box for the
varsity, and went for four innings. Dur
ing the first frame, singles by Kelly and
Stanton brought in two runs, after Elli
son and Stalker had gotten on the bases
by means of a fielder's choice and an in
field error. Newton Kelly, who is the
brother of George Kelly of Giant fame,
knocked a triple to deep left in the third,
but Lowenstein ended the inning by fan
ning Stanton.
The varsity came back with a sudden
rush in the fifth and tied the score, with
Parker, who played in right field all the
game, in the hero role. The inning
