# SOCCER VARSITY WINS SERIES FROM BRUINS
## Cardinal Defense Stops Rush of Blue and Gold Forwards; Walthers Makes Only Score 
### 
Somewhat gently, but none the less in
sistently, the Cardinal varsity soccer team
forced a l-to-0 defeat 011 the California
eleven at Berkeley yesterday and so won
the annual series between the two uni
versities for the second year in succession.
Yesterday's victory gives Stanford the
first "leg" on the Bellas trophy offered
this year by Silvio Bellas, captain of
the Stanford soccer eleven in 1912. In
their first meeting this season 011 the
morning of November 19 the rival varsi
ties had battled to a scoreless tie.
The lone score came fifteen minutes
after the start of the second half. There
was a scuffle on the left side near the
California goal, and a corner kick was
called. Elmore, Cardinal outside left,
placed the ball in front of the Blue and
Gold net, and Ted Walthers, playing cen
ter forward, "headed" it in.
The first half was see-saw up and down
the field, with honors about even. Dwight,
Stanford outside right, almost broke into
the scoring column with a well-placed
shot that struck the cross-bar.
Maloney's eleven displayed recupera
tive power that swept the Bruins off their
feet in the final period. Organized team
work and good individual playing kept the
ball in the California territory for the
majority of the forty-five minutes. The
Stanford forward line had many close
tries at goal and some barely missed,
while the Blue and Gold attack was ef
fectively smothered by the Cardinal
backs.
Premier honors must go to Franklin,
husky center half of the Cardinals. His
stand out as the best man on the field,
defensive and offensive playing made him
Ankersmith, California's star center-for
ward ,did 110 damage whatever to the
Stanford defense 011 account of Frank
lin's close guarding.
Mendonca, at fullback, George Clark,
inside right, Robinson, left half, and Bill
Gorman, captain and right half, played
their last game of soccer against Califor
nia, and wound up their three years of
service for the Cardinal in a blaze of
glory.
The Stanford line-up: Masters, goal;
Anderson, Mendonca, fullbacks; Gor
man, Franklin, Robinson, halves; Dwight,
Clark, Walthers, Mesa, Elmore, for
wards. Substitutions, D. Clark for An
derson, Q. Taylor for Robinson, Escourt
for Mesa.
