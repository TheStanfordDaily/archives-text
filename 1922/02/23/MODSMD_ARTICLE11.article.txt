back to spike the home platter. In the
sixth inning McCandless beat out a
throw to first, and reached third on a
passed ball to second. Aydelotte brought
in McCandless with a bingle to the left
lucky seventh, when Lawson connected
for a double, and went home on Robert's
garden. The last run was made in the
single.
The Lowell men scored in the third in
ning when Jenkins walked, advanced to
second on Weisbart's hit. and crossed the

on bases and only one out, a pretty
double play, Mulkey to Roberts to Mc-
Donald at first, retired a rather danger
ous rally.
Lawson was the heaviest batsman
for the freshmen, with a pair of two
baggers. Brown and Aydelotte gar
nered two singles each. The first
Stanford scores were made in the sec
ond inning. McCandless walked, and
McDonald hit to the pitcher, who
made an overthrow to second. Brown
rapped out a single into left field,
scoring both men.
Tn the next frame, Johnston started
off with a walk and stole second. Cutl
deback laid down a nice bunt and
reached first, advancing Johnston to
to third. Mulkey drove a deep single over
shortstop, enabling Johnston and Cudde
back to spike the home platter. In the
sixth inning McCandless beat out a
throw to first, and reached third on a
passed ball to second. Aydelotte brought
in McCandless with a bingle to the left
lucky seventh, when Lawson connected
for a double, and went home on Robert's
garden. The last run was made in the
single.
The Lowell men scored in the third in
ning when Jenkins walked, advanced to
second on Weisbart's hit. and crossed the
plate when Buchanan sent the ball into
left field. With the bases full and two
down, a force-out 'ended the rally. In the
last frame a„double and two singles net
ted only one tally for the high-school
players.
