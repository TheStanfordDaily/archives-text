# FRESHMAN CAGE TEAM EVENS SERIES WITH 29 TO 22 WIN OVER BEAR CUBS; CARDINAL LIGHTWEIGHTS ALSO VICTORS
## Seay Quintet Holds Lead from Start In Hotly Contested Battle 
### Henry Mack, ’24 
Stanford Freshmen 29, California Freshmen 22.
Taking the lead in the lirst minute of play, the Stanford Freshmen were never
on tlie short end of the score, and were complete masters of the game for most of
the forty minutes. The chief feature of the game was its roughness, both teams
going after the ball with a rush and tight that made many fouls inevitable.
A spurt by the Blue and Gold warriors in the final five minutes, which netted
them three baskets, put the Cardinals on the defensive for the first time during the
evening, and threatened to take on serious aspects, but a rally held the fighting
Berkeley men scoreless until the gun ended the game.
Basketball enthusiasts pronounced the game as one of the best that has been
played in the pavilion this year. Teamwork on the part of Coach Seay's team was
exhibited in nearly every play. There were i)o individual stars in the Stanford

line-up. Eacli man had a part to play
and played it, to the thorough satisfaction
of coach and fans alike.
Hoffman, captain of the Babe squad,
led off in the lirst minute with a fast
dribble and overhead shot, netting two
points for his team. Alexander followed
a moment later with a difficult shot from
side court, giving the Babes a 4-point
lead over the bewildered Bruins. Farrar
scored the first tally for the Berkeley
team, and Clement the second. From this
point the fast passing of the Cardinals
kept tbeir opponents in confusion, and
baskets by Steele, Shipke, Alexander, and
Hoffman ran the score to 14-9 by half
time.
In the second half the Berkeley Bears
had recovered some of their old fight,
and for the first three minutes neither
side scored a field goal, although a foul
gave California one more point. Two
personal fouls on Gooch ran the total to
18-10. Then Hoffman, ably aided by
Steele and Shipke as "feeders," made
two baskets in quick succession; Alexan
der, Steele, and Shipke contributed one
each, and the game was practically over.
Clement and Brobts staged a last min
ute attempt to overcome the lead of the
Stanford Babes, but close guarding held
them to a basket each.
Hoffman was the high point man for
the Stanford Babes, with a total of five
field goals and three converted fouls.
Alexander came second with four field
goals, and Shipke and Steele contributed
two each.
Hoffman was the sensation of the
game with his shots from the side of the
court. Steele out jumped both Kyte and
Schmeisner, in addition to mixing into
every play. Shipke was the keystone of
the Stanford offense. Alexander failed
to do much sensational shooting, but his
feeding to Hoffman was responsible for
many of the latter's points.
Clement and Farrar were the out
standing men of the Bruin line-up. Both
turned in three field goals during the
course of the game.
The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford — Alexander and Hoffman,
forwards; Steele, center; Shipke and
Oliva, guards. Substitutions, none.
California — Farrar and Clement, for
wards; Kyte, center; Buckley and Gooch,
guards. Substitutions — Schmeiser for

Stanford Freshmen 29, California Freshmen 22.
Taking the lead in the lirst minute of play, the Stanford Freshmen were never
on tlie short end of the score, and were complete masters of the game for most of
the forty minutes. The chief feature of the game was its roughness, both teams
going after the ball with a rush and tight that made many fouls inevitable.
A spurt by the Blue and Gold warriors in the final five minutes, which netted
them three baskets, put the Cardinals on the defensive for the first time during the
evening, and threatened to take on serious aspects, but a rally held the fighting
Berkeley men scoreless until the gun ended the game.
Basketball enthusiasts pronounced the game as one of the best that has been
played in the pavilion this year. Teamwork on the part of Coach Seay's team was
exhibited in nearly every play. There were i)o individual stars in the Stanford

line-up. Eacli man had a part to play
and played it, to the thorough satisfaction
of coach and fans alike.
Hoffman, captain of the Babe squad,
led off in the lirst minute with a fast
dribble and overhead shot, netting two
points for his team. Alexander followed
a moment later with a difficult shot from
side court, giving the Babes a 4-point
lead over the bewildered Bruins. Farrar
scored the first tally for the Berkeley
team, and Clement the second. From this
point the fast passing of the Cardinals
kept tbeir opponents in confusion, and
baskets by Steele, Shipke, Alexander, and
Hoffman ran the score to 14-9 by half
time.
In the second half the Berkeley Bears
had recovered some of their old fight,
and for the first three minutes neither
side scored a field goal, although a foul
gave California one more point. Two
personal fouls on Gooch ran the total to
18-10. Then Hoffman, ably aided by
Steele and Shipke as "feeders," made
two baskets in quick succession; Alexan
der, Steele, and Shipke contributed one
each, and the game was practically over.
Clement and Brobts staged a last min
ute attempt to overcome the lead of the
Stanford Babes, but close guarding held
them to a basket each.
Hoffman was the high point man for
the Stanford Babes, with a total of five
field goals and three converted fouls.
Alexander came second with four field
goals, and Shipke and Steele contributed
two each.
Hoffman was the sensation of the
game with his shots from the side of the
court. Steele out jumped both Kyte and
Schmeisner, in addition to mixing into
every play. Shipke was the keystone of
the Stanford offense. Alexander failed
to do much sensational shooting, but his
feeding to Hoffman was responsible for
many of the latter's points.
Clement and Farrar were the out
standing men of the Bruin line-up. Both
turned in three field goals during the
course of the game.
The teams lined up as follows:
Stanford — Alexander and Hoffman,
forwards; Steele, center; Shipke and
Oliva, guards. Substitutions, none.
California — Farrar and Clement, for
wards; Kyte, center; Buckley and Gooch,
guards. Substitutions — Schmeiser for
Kate. Brobts for Farrar.
Referee —Boek.
