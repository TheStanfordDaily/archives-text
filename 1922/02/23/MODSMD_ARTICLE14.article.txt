# MIDGETS ROMP AWAY FROM BLUE AND GOLD IN FINAL CONTEST
## BI Hal Rorke, ’24 
### 
Stanford's 130-pound team won its Big
Scries from California, last night, by
racing away with the second game, 28-15.
The same line-up, with the exception of
Hogle, ran its way to a decisive victory
after defeating California, last Friday,
25-23, in Harmon Gymnasium.
Almost, mechanical teamwork charac
terized the playing of the midgets. For
mations, which started from almost any
where on the floor, seemed to have only
makeshift opposition, and, consequently,
the ball was under California's basket, or
on its way there, nearly all of the time.
Coach "Bud" Young, playing running
guard, scored more than half of the
points. He was uncannily accurate, mak
ing baskets from any angle. Sixteen of
the twenty-eight counts were scored by
Young, on both field and free throws.
Every man was responsible for a spec
tacular bit of guarding at one time or an
other during the game. The Bruins could
never hit a rally but what somebody
would do the impossible and break it up.
Sanford and Meyers, playing forwards,
had a large share in tightening up the
defense and each sent several pretty
shots for scores.
Captain Silviera played a consistent
game at getting the ball out of danger.
He finished up, playing the same steady
basketball he has shown all season.
Blosser did good work at center al
though he did not succeed in making any
baskets.
California again scored heavily on free
throws. Ruby made eight of the Blue
and Gold tallies, most of which were
from foul conversions.
It might have been a somewhat differ
ent story if California had realized the
function of the basket more fully. Time
and again they were in a position to
make an easy shot and fuddled it some
how.
The midgets will next go after the
P. A. A. championship. They have won
their first game already, defeating the
team which was doped to win the title.
The line-ups were: Stanford—Meyers.
Sanford, forwards; Blosser. center;
Young and Silviera, guards. California—
Pressler, Spurlock. forwards; Gow, cen
ter; Ruby, Hayes, guards. Hogle and
Hobro also got into the game for Stan
ford. California substituted Dickenson.
Thompson, Abey, McCreary, and Mc-
Cann.
