The response of outside alumni and friends to the
"First Million for Stanford" campaign is proving
the assertions made by those in charge, that strong'
support from the students in the time of the drive
on the campus would insure a greater return from
those who live oft* the campus and whose connection
with the University as alumni and friends is not so
immediate and active as that of the students.
In Palo Alto, the closest community to the Uni
versity, and where everyone lives in an atmosphere
tempered by the University and its activities, the
response to the campaign which began in earnest
the first of the week is loyal and prompt. The people
of Palo Alto realize keenly the need that Stanford
is in for money to provide for immediate necessities
of housing and feeding, and also see the good which
will accrue to Palo Alto from this increase in the
University.
The spirit of co-operation between Stanford and
its friends is being brought more clearly to light
by prompt, unhesitating answer to this appeal than
it ever was before, because here is something tangible
wherein all can take a hand. The work of the Palo
Altons is appreciated as a noticeable forecast of"the
success that the entire campaign is to enjoy.
