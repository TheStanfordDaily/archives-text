# COMING BACK STRONG
## 
### 
The way the Freshmen fought in the game with
the Bear Cubs last night makes the old song, "You're
never down till you're out," ring true. The babes
went into the struggle with a determination to win
any way they could, just so it was fai r . The game
was rough, with a continuous fall of players to the
floor, but was kept interesting all the time through
the spirit of "never say die exhibited by both quin
tets. It is not too much to say for the Californians
that they put up an excellent fight for a team which
never came close to winning the game. Ihe light
weight battle between the Cardinals and Blue and
Gold was full of pretty basket work and excellent
team play.
