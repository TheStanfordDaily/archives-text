# COURTESY
## 
### 
When Doctor Jordan came into the stands at the
baseball game yesterday afternoon the first man
who noticed him stood up. The example was fol
lowed by practically all the people in that section

of the bleachers. This mark of courtesy, which is
always extended to the Chancellor in meetings on
the Quad, is just another manifestation of the love
and respect commanded by Doctor Jordan among
the student body. It is a good sign of the hotno
geniety of the "Stanford family."
