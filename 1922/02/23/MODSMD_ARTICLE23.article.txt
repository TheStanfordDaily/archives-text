“CLIFF” CAME BACK TO THE FARM yesterday
with the same old spirit and line of chatter
that never grows old. As we eagerly look forward
to spring, those of us who have seen and heard
Cliff once wait for his return. Thirty years of
playing Stanford nines hasn't changed much about
Cliff but the color.of h's hair, and he always brings
the same message of cheer with him when he comes.
Incidentally, he took away a victory he came for.
