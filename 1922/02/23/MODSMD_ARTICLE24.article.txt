Dear Head of Cabbage :
It's all wrong trying to call us Indians. That's not our
name and never will be. These fancy nicknames are just
one aspect of professionalization of college sports. Many a
hick who never heard of the university on the other side of
the bay thinks the Bears stand for a National League base
ball team. Many aggregations besides the vanishing race
have been called Indians, but the Cardinal stands for just
one thing: Stanford, just as "S"'stands for serpentine.
m**
Harvard has made the Crimson distinctive of herself,
and here's trusting we've made the Cardinal just as remi
niscent of Stanford. You'll find Indians in front of every
cigar store, in every bowling alley league, and hop-skotch
competition, and serving as a label for everything from
cracked-iced tamales to Swedish raviolas.
» * *
If the 308 Econ majors at Stanford want a broad enough
field for their talents they might attempt the rearrangement
of industry in the Directory of Students.
* * m
A few industries are overcrowded and most unprovided
for. As an example of labor surplus, take the fishing
business. Here we have four Fishers and only two Fish.
♦ * *
Then, probably because of the announcement that Stan
ford is to be a state zoological reserve, two of the three
Hunters at the University last quarter have left. Just what
the survivor, Kenneth, will hunt, I don't know, particularly
as he is majoring in mining. Well, for equipment he has
only one Cannon, two Horns, and a Horner, and with this he
can seek one Baer, two Lyons, four Wolfs, and two Hares.
Stanford has only one Bird for him.
* * »
We have only two Miners at Stanford. We have nary
a Sailor, just one "Seaman." No wonder crew suffers!
* » «
Our only Churchman is a woman. But we have two Bish
ops and two Popes, who probably belong under the same
general heading.
♦ * »
Women are found in surprising numbers in masculine
trades, showing what higher education does for feminine
emancipation. Whether due to the now-passing "bobbed
hair" fad or not I do not know, but three of our four
Barbers are women. In fact, the last remaining male
Barber left last quarter!
* * *
Moreover, we have ten Kings and no Queens, thus prov
ing every co-ed is a queen, so much so that none shall reign
over her with a capital Q.
* * *
We have more Smiths than we have people in any
other industry, thirty in all. The Millers total twenty
two. And, oh you formals, we have no less than eleven
Taylors! No wonder that all three of our Cooks are
men. And we have three Webbs but only one Weaver.
* « *
AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE ARCHER AND ONLY
ONE CUPID.
* * *
Tuesday devoted his whole colyum to Flappers this week
and didn't mention what I think is the only kind we need
on this Farm, the kind they had on the island of Laputa in
"Gulliver's Travels." These Laputans were so intellectual
that they were habitually in a brown study. Each, there
fore, had a servant at his side with a bladder full of shot,
tied to a stick with a piece of string, called a flapper. ..When
his master was spoken to, the servant would crack the thinker
on the bean with his instrument and wake him up. I think I'll
carry one and find a gent who doesn't respond
to "hello" (and many don't because they're too busy congi
tating how many minuses and pluses equal cum laudos) I'll
knock him with my flapper for a goal.
* * *
"Brick" Morse wrote last night: "Men who hold a di
ploma from a college which always has a winning foot
ball team are considered by the world to amount to a
little bit more than other college graduates." A diploma
from Johns Hopkins or Columbia must be a mere scrap
of paper to Bricklets.
* * *
No frosh pec-rade yesterday, but we sure rushed the
Growler. Three times, for good luck, did the Bruin Gold
get the axe, which our men swung in true George Washing
ton style. C'al could certainly say yesterday, "We got the
axe." It happens, though, that the most important Stanford
Axe hasn't been swiped by Berkeley, and if they'd take it
away it'd tickle us immensely. Its something they haven't
got up there at all and something we could get along better
without, s owhy won't they take it away—"The Faculty Axe.
* * *
Why didn't they let A1 Hooper?
* * »
IF you're hurrying for a train and a guy stops you and
makes you miss it all because lie wants to borrow $10 —
Well, you might be a trifle angry, as it were;
IF you lost time waiting half an hour for a postoftice to
open yesterday morning in order to get an epistle from
Sweetie before you realized it was a holiday,
Well, you might be a bit irritated, so to speak; BUT
If you want to get out of an li o'clock and get to the
Union before so many hogs get their feet in the trough that
you lose your appetite, and the prof keeps* the class until
12:03 or 12:07, THEN
I can't print your sentiments in this colyum.
Such a prof ought to be made to eat at the Union or Inn
for a month every day beginning at 12:15. If he had to, the
doc would advise him to give the class a few cuts until he felt
better again.

Dear Head of Cabbage :
It's all wrong trying to call us Indians. That's not our
name and never will be. These fancy nicknames are just
one aspect of professionalization of college sports. Many a
hick who never heard of the university on the other side of
the bay thinks the Bears stand for a National League base
ball team. Many aggregations besides the vanishing race
have been called Indians, but the Cardinal stands for just
one thing: Stanford, just as "S"'stands for serpentine.
m**
Harvard has made the Crimson distinctive of herself,
and here's trusting we've made the Cardinal just as remi
niscent of Stanford. You'll find Indians in front of every
cigar store, in every bowling alley league, and hop-skotch
competition, and serving as a label for everything from
cracked-iced tamales to Swedish raviolas.
» * *
If the 308 Econ majors at Stanford want a broad enough
field for their talents they might attempt the rearrangement
of industry in the Directory of Students.
* * m
A few industries are overcrowded and most unprovided
for. As an example of labor surplus, take the fishing
business. Here we have four Fishers and only two Fish.
♦ * *
Then, probably because of the announcement that Stan
ford is to be a state zoological reserve, two of the three
Hunters at the University last quarter have left. Just what
the survivor, Kenneth, will hunt, I don't know, particularly
as he is majoring in mining. Well, for equipment he has
only one Cannon, two Horns, and a Horner, and with this he
can seek one Baer, two Lyons, four Wolfs, and two Hares.
Stanford has only one Bird for him.
* * »
We have only two Miners at Stanford. We have nary
a Sailor, just one "Seaman." No wonder crew suffers!
* » «
Our only Churchman is a woman. But we have two Bish
ops and two Popes, who probably belong under the same
general heading.
♦ * »
Women are found in surprising numbers in masculine
trades, showing what higher education does for feminine
emancipation. Whether due to the now-passing "bobbed
hair" fad or not I do not know, but three of our four
Barbers are women. In fact, the last remaining male
Barber left last quarter!
* * *
Moreover, we have ten Kings and no Queens, thus prov
ing every co-ed is a queen, so much so that none shall reign
over her with a capital Q.
* * *
We have more Smiths than we have people in any

Dear Head of Cabbage :
It's all wrong trying to call us Indians. That's not our
name and never will be. These fancy nicknames are just
one aspect of professionalization of college sports. Many a
hick who never heard of the university on the other side of
the bay thinks the Bears stand for a National League base
ball team. Many aggregations besides the vanishing race
have been called Indians, but the Cardinal stands for just
one thing: Stanford, just as "S"'stands for serpentine.
m**
Harvard has made the Crimson distinctive of herself,
and here's trusting we've made the Cardinal just as remi
niscent of Stanford. You'll find Indians in front of every
cigar store, in every bowling alley league, and hop-skotch
competition, and serving as a label for everything from
cracked-iced tamales to Swedish raviolas.
» * *
If the 308 Econ majors at Stanford want a broad enough
field for their talents they might attempt the rearrangement
of industry in the Directory of Students.
* * m
A few industries are overcrowded and most unprovided
for. As an example of labor surplus, take the fishing
business. Here we have four Fishers and only two Fish.
♦ * *
Then, probably because of the announcement that Stan
ford is to be a state zoological reserve, two of the three
Hunters at the University last quarter have left. Just what
the survivor, Kenneth, will hunt, I don't know, particularly
as he is majoring in mining. Well, for equipment he has
only one Cannon, two Horns, and a Horner, and with this he
can seek one Baer, two Lyons, four Wolfs, and two Hares.
Stanford has only one Bird for him.
* * »
We have only two Miners at Stanford. We have nary
a Sailor, just one "Seaman." No wonder crew suffers!
* » «
Our only Churchman is a woman. But we have two Bish
ops and two Popes, who probably belong under the same
general heading.
♦ * »
Women are found in surprising numbers in masculine
trades, showing what higher education does for feminine
emancipation. Whether due to the now-passing "bobbed
hair" fad or not I do not know, but three of our four
Barbers are women. In fact, the last remaining male
Barber left last quarter!
* * *
Moreover, we have ten Kings and no Queens, thus prov
ing every co-ed is a queen, so much so that none shall reign
over her with a capital Q.
* * *
We have more Smiths than we have people in any
other industry, thirty in all. The Millers total twenty
two. And, oh you formals, we have no less than eleven
Taylors! No wonder that all three of our Cooks are
men. And we have three Webbs but only one Weaver.
* « *
AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE ARCHER AND ONLY
ONE CUPID.
* * *
Tuesday devoted his whole colyum to Flappers this week
and didn't mention what I think is the only kind we need
on this Farm, the kind they had on the island of Laputa in
"Gulliver's Travels." These Laputans were so intellectual
that they were habitually in a brown study. Each, there
fore, had a servant at his side with a bladder full of shot,
tied to a stick with a piece of string, called a flapper. ..When
his master was spoken to, the servant would crack the thinker
on the bean with his instrument and wake him up. I think I'll
carry one and find a gent who doesn't respond
to "hello" (and many don't because they're too busy congi
tating how many minuses and pluses equal cum laudos) I'll
knock him with my flapper for a goal.
* * *
"Brick" Morse wrote last night: "Men who hold a di
ploma from a college which always has a winning foot
ball team are considered by the world to amount to a
little bit more than other college graduates." A diploma
from Johns Hopkins or Columbia must be a mere scrap
of paper to Bricklets.
* * *
No frosh pec-rade yesterday, but we sure rushed the
Growler. Three times, for good luck, did the Bruin Gold
get the axe, which our men swung in true George Washing
ton style. C'al could certainly say yesterday, "We got the
axe." It happens, though, that the most important Stanford
Axe hasn't been swiped by Berkeley, and if they'd take it
away it'd tickle us immensely. Its something they haven't
got up there at all and something we could get along better
without, s owhy won't they take it away—"The Faculty Axe.
* * *
Why didn't they let A1 Hooper?
* * »
IF you're hurrying for a train and a guy stops you and
makes you miss it all because lie wants to borrow $10 —
Well, you might be a trifle angry, as it were;
IF you lost time waiting half an hour for a postoftice to
open yesterday morning in order to get an epistle from
Sweetie before you realized it was a holiday,
Well, you might be a bit irritated, so to speak; BUT
If you want to get out of an li o'clock and get to the
Union before so many hogs get their feet in the trough that
you lose your appetite, and the prof keeps* the class until
12:03 or 12:07, THEN
I can't print your sentiments in this colyum.
Such a prof ought to be made to eat at the Union or Inn
for a month every day beginning at 12:15. If he had to, the
doc would advise him to give the class a few cuts until he felt
better again.
