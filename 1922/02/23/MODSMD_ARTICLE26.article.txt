# College Wits Number of Judge To Close March 1
## 
### 
Are you a college wit? Or can you
spring any? Well, that's nice. Here's
your chance, ladies and gentlemen.
Closing March 1, the College Wits'
Number of Judge (the leading comic
weekly, you know—sign on the dotted
line) is open to contributions from
humorists of every college in the coun
try. All effusions entered in the contest
will be credited to the college from which
they originated, as well as to the author.
A handsome cup—solid silver and all that
—will be awarded to the college having
the greatest number of printed contribu
tions, and to the contributor who flings
the best line. And—here's the rub—all
accepted contributions will be paid for—
providing they arrive by March 1.
