# Cathetometer Purchased By Chemistry Department
## 
### 
A cathetometer, which is an instrument
for measuring height accurately on a
small scale, has recently been purchased
by the Chemistry department. The in
strument is installed in Professor S. W.
Young's office, and is being used at pres
ent in connection with the experiments
of John Russell on vapor pressures at
low temperature. It is valued at $100.
It will measure accurately to one
twentieth of a millimeter, and can be
used for such things as measuring the
capillary rise of fluids, etc.
The University has had a similar in
strument in its possession for twenty
years, but it has been thrown slightly off
true and is not accurate for small dis
tances.
