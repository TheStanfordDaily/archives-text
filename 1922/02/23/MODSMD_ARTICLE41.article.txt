## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Y. M. C. A.
cabinet were addressed Tuesday evening
by D. E. Baker of Pomona. Baker is
the coast representative to the National
Council of the "Y," and will leave soon
for the East.
Changes in the basis of membership in
the association, tending to liberalize it,
was one of the main points upon which
Baker touched. He also spoke of the re
cent means taken to extend and multiply
the types of service and deepen and in
tensify the religious spirit behind this
service.
The National Council to which Baker
is a delegate is a committee of students
who talk over the interests of the student
movement in the United States. It helps
advise the International Committee, which
in turn gets its power from the local asso
ciations such as the Stanford "Y."
