# Safe Weighing Over Ton Taken to Second Floor of Administration Building
## 
### 
Filling the lobby of the Administra
tion Building with block and tackle, guy
ropes, and noise, a 2800-peund safe was
hoisted to the second floor of the building
Tuesday afternoon for the use of the ac
counting department. A forty-foot pole,
anchored by ropes extending to all cor
ners of the lobby,, was used to support
the raising pulley, and the safe was
hoisted by means of a rope attached to
a truck in the driveway outside. The
heavy box was set in place in the up
stairs offices in less than an hour.
This safe is to be used by the cashier
in the accounting offices. A smaller safe
will be turned over to the Board of Ath
letic Control. The new arrival will make
the fourth now used in the accounting
offices.
