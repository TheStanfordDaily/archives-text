# Literary Fire Disturbs Peace of Holiday for University Bookworms
## 
### 
Washington's birthday relaxation was
interrupted at the Library yesterday
when a fire started in a pile of waste at
the bottom of the elevator shaft. Crossed
wires in the armature of the motor was
the cause and, although no great damage
resulted, a considerable amount of com
posure was momentarily destroyed.
As the fire whistle shrieked solemnly,
the engine came roaring down the street
just in time to meet a mob of students
flocking out of the Libj-ary. Both groups
were looking for a fire, but to the de
partment it looked like post-earthquake
business.
With heroism in their eyes, the squad
of fire fighters pushed through the jamâ€”
only to stand around and watch Fire
Marshal Ed Lamb extinguish the blaze
with one chemical tank.
