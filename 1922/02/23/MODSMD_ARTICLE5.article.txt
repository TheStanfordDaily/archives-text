# TICKETS FOR BRUIN GAME NOW ON SALE
## Van Gent Puts Final Touches on Card Squad for Second Contest with Bear Quintet 
### 
Pasteboards for the second game of
the Stanford-California basketball series
at the Oakland Auditorium Saturday
night have been placed on sale on the
campus. They may be obtained at Jack
Meyer's in Encina or at Greene's cigar
store.
Holders of student body cards will be
charged 50 cents, while the price for all
others is $1. As the Auditorium has a
capacity of 6,00(), it is not expected that
there will be any difficulty in obtaining
seats, but those who buy their tickets at
the box office will have to pay the full
rate.
Washington's birthday meant nothing
to Van Gent's hard-working crew of
varsity basketers, who improved the holi
day by having a stiff workout on the pa
vilion floor. This afternoon the varsity
squad is scheduled to travel to Oakland
to familiarize themselves as much as pos
sible with the ins and outs of the Au
ditorium court.
The floor there is not strange to three
of the Cardinal basket tossers. Jimmy
Davies remembers it as the scene of the
third and deciding contest last year when
he made 17 out of the 25 points which
won the series,for Stanford. Dick Rich
mond and "Lefty" Rogers were also
among those present on that same night.
Stanford is at present perched rather
precariously in fifth place in the Pacific
Coast Conference standings. A small
shove in the form of a defeat by Cali
fornia Saturday night will tumble the
Cardinal below Washington State. On
the other hand, a victory over Wight's
gang will practically clinch Stanford's
position.
A short practice tomorrow and Van
Gent's varsity will be ready to invade
the Bears' own territory Saturday night.
The Cardinal squad is for tjie first time
since the start of the season at its full
strength. If nothing happens in the next
two days, there Will be what is commonly
called a "battle royal" when the two
fives meet at the Auditorium.
For Stanford Saturday's contest is the
last chance. Tf they lose, the series will
go to the Berkeleyites for the first time
in two years. If they win, as they are
hoping to do, a third game will be played
on the same court Friday, March 3.
