the guarding work of Pollard and Cairns
being very good.
Neer ran up 12 of the 21 points with
live field goals and three free .throws.
Both Dennis and Gerson tossed the ball
through the net twice. Cornell scored
the first basket for Alpha Kappa Lambda
on a long shot, when the first half .was
nearly over, and, in addition, converted
three free thi'ows. Howe made the other
field goal. Rawlins, the losers' star man.
was also a marked man, and he was un
able to get loose for his customary scores.
The entire game was clean and free from
roughing.
Theta Chi got off to a good start and
piled up eight points before the Phi
Kappa Sigma players could find the bas
ket. The whirlwind finish of the latter
quintet, however, cinched the contest.
In the first half, Plii Kappa Sigma
forwards missed many easy shots. Then
Crandall broke through with the first
score, which was followed by baskets by
Thomas and Coulthurst. The accurate
throwing of Hollingsworth, forward,
gave the Theta Chi five a 10-6 lead at
half time.
Both teams went strong in the second
period. Two field goals each by Crandall
and Thomas and a free throw by Coult
hurst brought the Phi Kappa Sigma score
up to 15. while Theta Chi hung on to a
slim lead of one point. With several
minutes to play, Thomas raced under the
basket and dropped the ball through the
hoop, transferring the cherished tally to
Phi Kappa Sigma.
