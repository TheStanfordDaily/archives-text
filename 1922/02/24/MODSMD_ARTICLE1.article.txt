# VARSITY SQUAD MEETS OLYMPIC NINE TOMORROW
## Seay's Diamond Team Wages Fifth Battle of Season with San Francisco Club Here 
### Carl Shoup, â€™24 
\arsity will hold sway tomor
row afternoon on the local diamond when
Coach Seay's men engage in the fifth of
their early season battles. The Olympic
Club nine will be the aggregation which
the varsity will attempt to wipe up, and
from all reports from the city this task
would be no easy job for any team, as
the clubmen have several very able ball
tossers on their team.
So far this season the varsity has
shown great potential strength, which,
under the coaching of Duffy Seay, is
tending to develop one of the strongest
baseball teams that ever represented
Stanford. Of the four contests played
so far, the varsity has won two and lost
two, but the two games lost were by
close scores against admittedly strong
teams. '1 he M. J. B. Coffee Kids came
out ahead 4-2, because they had an
American League pitcher and heavy hit
ting power. Ireland's Independents suc
ceeded in winning only after a last
inning rally, and then came within an ace,
of being defeated by a counter-rail^.
The two victories won have been over
the bederal Reserve Bank team from San
Francisco and the Alumni nine. In both
of these cases the varsity won by de
cisive scores, and showed an ability to
pickle the apple that brought cheer to the
hearts of those that remember former
hitless years.
Infield and batting practice has been
flic order of the day lately, and as the
wet weather hindered outdoor work to a
great extent last week, ic has been a case
of making up some lost time. No recent
additions to the casualty list have been
noted except Peavy, who was hit on the
head yesterday in practice when a
grounder bounced up in his face. How
ever, he will probably be in shape for
tomorrow's game.
Following the contest tomorrow with
the Olympic Club, the schedule calls for
a long series of games up to the first con
test with California on April 8. Twenty
games constitute the varsity schedule as
arranged at present, and of these four
have been played. This means an aver
age of three, and sometimes four, games
a week will be on the varsity menu.
The game will start at 3 o'clock on the
varsity field. No admission will be
charged to students with student body
cards. Otherwise the admission price will
be 25 cents.

Following the contest tomorrow with
the Olympic Club, the schedule calls for
a long series of games up to the first con
test with California on April 8. Twenty
games constitute the varsity schedule as
arranged at present, and of these four
have been played. This means an aver
age of three, and sometimes four, games
a week will be on the varsity menu.
The game will start at 3 o'clock on the
varsity field. No admission will be
charged to students with student body
cards. Otherwise the admission price will
be 25 cents.
