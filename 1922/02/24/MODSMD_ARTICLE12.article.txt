Alpha Delta Phi and Delta Upsilon
staged an "eye for an eye" battle from

the Alpha Delta Phi scoring combination
gave the winners a lead which was never
seriously threatened. Regardless of
string guarding, each team was able to
penetrate fairly close to the basket, and
not many long shots were attempted.

and tossed in three field goals. Neer
found the basket from the field once, and
converted four out of five free throws.
The other basket was made by Cairns,
running guard. Pollard consistently re
covered the ball in the home territory.

one of tlie fastest men on the court, and

nine points. Atwill, running guard,
looped in the first D. U. score, the only
one in the first half, by a long throw
from mid-court.
The score at half time was 7-2, but
Phil Neer made his opponents nervous
by rolling the ball around the hoop sev
eral times. In the first minute of the
second half, Gerson and Neer threw field
goals. Lacey came back with a basket.
In the last five minutes the D. U.'s staged
a final spurt, and Lacey and Reinhold
hung up live tallies.

Lambda-Phi Kappa Sigma game was
close, with a 6-0 advantage in favor of
the former. The burden of defensive
work was thrown on Phi Kappa Sigma,
although possession of the ball alternated
fairly evenly. However, the faster A.
K. L. quintet was able to get more and
fiettcr shots at the basket.
Rawlins and Cornell of the victors
worked together well and were easily
the best basket shooters on the floor.
Both men scored three field goals, while
Cornell made a pair of free throws
count. Sloan came up from running
guard to add the other two tallies.
In the second half, the pace quickened
and the Phi Kappa Sigma players began
to make their efforts show results.
Thomas made the first basket. Crandall
and Sweeney duplicated this perform
ance, and Coulthurst tossed two free
throws. But at the same time Rawlins,

fiettcr shots at the basket.

of a 14-9 score in a fast final series game
with Delta Upsilon, yesterday, and Alpha
Kappa Lambda's court team won from
Phi Kappa Sigma, 16-8.

staged an "eye for an eye" battle from
start to finish. The greater accuracy of
the Alpha Delta Phi scoring combination
gave the winners a lead which was never
seriously threatened. Regardless of
string guarding, each team was able to
penetrate fairly close to the basket, and
not many long shots were attempted.

and tossed in three field goals. Neer
found the basket from the field once, and
converted four out of five free throws.
The other basket was made by Cairns,
running guard. Pollard consistently re
covered the ball in the home territory.

one of tlie fastest men on the court, and

nine points. Atwill, running guard,
looped in the first D. U. score, the only
one in the first half, by a long throw
from mid-court.
