# CARDINAL FIVE PLAYS CALIFORNIA TOMORROW
## Rival Varsities at Full Strength for Second Contest of Series in Oakland Auditorium 
### 
Cardinal meets Bear tomorrow night at the Oakland Auditorium.
With everything to gain and very little to lose, the Stanford varsity basket
ball five awaits the so-called "crucial" game of the year. California is confi
dent of victory. The Cardinal warriors, primed for the biggest event of the
1922 basketball season, are hopefulâ€”eager to wipe out the memory of a 24-to
-14 defeat three weeks ago.
Should things take the trend most generally expected by followers of the
court game in bay regions, the Blue and Gold will win. Comparative scores
and past performances mean nothing, however, where teams from Stanford
and California are concerned. There are more than a few who believe that it
is written in the books for the Cardinal quintet to accomplish the unexpected
and even the series with a victory. \
