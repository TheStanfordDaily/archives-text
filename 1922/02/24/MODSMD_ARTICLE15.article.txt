# Bears Working for Nine Straight Wins In Conference Race
## 
### James B. Hutchison 
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 24.â€”With |
eight consecutive victories to its credit,
California enters the second and crucial
game of the Stanford series Saturday
night with its chances of finishing among
the leaders of the conference either ma
terially brightened or completely ruined
by the outcome of the contest. A win
over the Cardinal promotes the possibility
of tieing wrth the University of Washing
ton for second place in tlie conference
scoring column, while a defeat would
practically spell ruin.
The Bears must be conceded the edge
so f;~ as comparative scores are con
cermf. 1 hey defeated ttlu> Cardinal jin
the first game of the series, scored a
double victory over Washington State,
which in turn, defeated Stanford and
overwhelmed Oregon and U. S. C. by
large scores. But comparative scores are
disregarded in -a Stanford-California
contest. Stanford, ready to avenge the
first defeat, and California with every
thing to gain by victory, possess the in
gredients that form nothing but fight.
California, with one exception, is at its
full strength, the only disabled regular
being forward "Hal" Coop, who will be
missing from the line-up because of a
broken nose received in the last game
with U. S. C. Talt, a sophomore on the
squad, who has starred consistently for
the Bears, has been going better than ever
in the more recent games and is certain
to start. Taylor Douthit, who has been
alternating with Coop at,a forward berth,
will no doubt be selected by Coach Wight
to start the game. Douthit's playing this
year shows a noticeable improvement
over his work last season. Talt is liis
only superior when it comes to shooting
baskets. "Jeff'' Larkey, completely re
covered from his illness, will start at
center, and with Captain Eggleston and
Lehane holding down the guard positions,
California will be in excellent sh^pe.
