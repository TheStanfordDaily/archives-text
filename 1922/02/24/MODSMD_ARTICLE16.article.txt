# DR. HENRYLANZ TO PLAY RUSSIAN MUSIC AT LECTURE-RECITAL
## 
### 
Dr. Henry Lanz of the Slavic depart
ment will give a lecture-recital on the
subject of Russian music next Tuesday
evening at 7:30 in the Little Theater.
Tliis concert will take the place of the
usual Tuesday lecture for next week.
Dr. Lanz will give a brief outline of
•the history of music in Russia up to the
nineteenth century. Jn his opinion, the
success of the modern Russian music is
due to its peculiar form of development.
It has always been closely allied with the
history of the country.
He will then take up leading composers
of today, such as Rubcnstein, Tchaikov
sky and Borodin, and will play a selection
from each of them. In choosing his pro
gram, Dr. Lanz has taken the works
which he considers as most representa
tive of the musician and those which will
appeal most to the American public.
The first part of the program will con
sist of the folk melodies and church
music from which the modern Russian
music has grown. Among the numbers
from the modern composers will be "The
Song of India" by Rimsky-Korsakov.
"Rocky Tsle" by Rubinstein, and Rach
maninoff's "Prelude in C Sharp Minor.'
Dr. Lanz has given this lecture-recitat
for the Fortnightly Club of Palo Alto
and the Sorosis Club of San Francisco.
He is well known to Stanford people as
a musician and is a member of the Stan
ford Music Club.

Van Gent's men art- lit. For the first
time since the opening of the cage sea
son, there is no sickness to disrupt the
ranks at the last minute; no injuries to
keep the players from going at top speed.
Across the hay, with the ease of those
who have already proved their superior
ity, the Bruin basketers are resting. They,
too, will be at full strength.
For two of the Stanford quintet, Sat
urday's battle may be the final "big
game." Davies and Richmond for two
years have fought 011 the court against
the Blue and Gold—and their Cardinal
team has won both times. Tomorrow's
game will not be the last if they can pre
vent it, for they have their eyes fixed on
a final and deciding contest March 3.
"Lefty" Rogers is not exactly a
stranger to the Bruins, who remember
him from last year. He was off to a slow
start year, but now he is going at a
steady rate. To aid and abet Jimmy Da
vits in his efforts to roll up the score for
Stanford there is Nip McHose, former
freshman flash, who has been as con
sistent as any member of Van Gent's
squad.
Bob Janssen and DeGroot are the
heavy ones of the Cardinal team that
will take the floor and upon them falls
the bulk of the defensive work, with the
former aiding the attack. Van Gent has
worked wonders with DeGroot, practi
cally taking the big fellow off the grid
iron and making a standing guard of
him.
Several things have happened since that
night on the Stanford court three weeks
ago when a fighting Cardinal varsity,
weakened by the sickness of three first
string players, played California to a
standstill, only to lose out in the final
minutes.
Washington State has come and gone
—and left a brace of defeats pinned on
Stanford. Not decisive set-backs, but
still defeats that count against the Cardi
nal in the mind of the dopester. Cali
fornia disposed of the Cougars in two
straight games. With Oregon it was a
different story. The Blue and Gold won
from the Webfooters by 110 greater a
margin than did Van Gent's men.
Guessing the Stanford line-up has been
a favorite pastime for cage fans all sea
son. Tomorrow they will probably look
something like this:
Stanford Position California
Davies (C) forward I alt
Rogers forward Douthit
Janssen center Larkey
Richmond guard ....Eggleston (C)
DeGroot guard LeHane
Reserves: Stanford —McHose,'Cleave-
lnnd, Piggott, forwards; Pittsg. Ander
son, guards. California —Coop, Butler,
forwards.
