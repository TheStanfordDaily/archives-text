A year ago the Cardinal went over to Oakland and
before a crowd of some 10,000 whipped the Bine and
Gold in what was one of the most spectacular games
of basketball ever played in the West. Rivalry was
then at its height in the two institutions, as it will
be tomorrow night on account of the game being
the deciding one of the California series. We have
the reputation of always being at the best when on
the short end of the dope, and it has been born out
true in sports this year.
Although the title to the Pacific Coast Conference
is not at stake this year there is the same keen com
petition between the two Pacific Coast universities.
A full house on the Stanford side of the Civic Audi
torium will go a long way toward the team's bringing
home the long end of the score and a right to contend
one more game for the title to the California league.
