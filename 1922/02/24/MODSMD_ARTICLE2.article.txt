# FRESHMAN NINE TO PLAY DOUBLE HEADER WITH BAY PLAYERS
## 
### 
Floyd "Kallam's freshman ball team
will play a double-header tomorrow with
visitors from the bay region. In the
morning at 10:30, Berkeley High School
will take the diamond, and in the after
noon the Polytechnic nine from San
Francisco will endeavor to take home a
young redskin's scalp.
Both high school clubs are reported
to have a strong aggregation of players.
The infancy of the baseball season offers
little comparative dope. Polytechnic has
a first rate battery and is about on a par
with Lowell High's nine, which the Card
Babes defeated Wednesday by a 6-2
score.
For the freshmen, probably the same
men who played Wednesday will line up
tomorrow. Johnston has been receiving
the deliveries behind the bat. McDonald
and Cuddeback have been performing
satisfactorily on first and third. A large
part of the infield class rests on Mulkey
and Roberts. Mulkey picks grounders
out of shortstop territory, while "Shorty"
Roberts plays like a big leaguer at sec
ond base. Lawson, Brown, and McCand
less have been gathering in the flics and
line drives which reach the outfield.
Kallam has lined up his pitching staff,
and may give most of the members a
chance to take the mound.
