# FIRE AWAY
## 
### 
When Eddie Lamb gets through with his crusade
of installation of fire plugs around the campus, in
cipient blazes won't have a chance against the fire
department. Prevention in the strongest sense of the
word is being made by putting hydrants in all the
crowded districts of the campus and sprinkled lib
erally about the wooden built part of the University
property. The high-pressure mains are being tapped,
which will give strong force to the water and will
make the direction of large streams of water possible
in each area of the University grounds.
The inspection of campus dwellings is continuing
and the fire inspector is making every effort to get
rid of the piles of rubbish and combustibles which
are in so many of the houses on the campus. Most
of the living groups are co-operating with the fire de
partment in cleaning out their spare parts closets, but
there still remains a lot to be done in the way of doing
away with accumulations in cellars and garrets.
With spring coming on, the grass will dry, and then
will come the time of the brush fires from matches
carelessly thrown aside by passing smokers. It is to
the interest of all to see that the yards and basements
around their houses are kept clean so that a blaze can
not be communicated to the building.
