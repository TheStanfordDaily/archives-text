# "RETICENCE TO REPORT"
## 
### 
The Wharton School of Finance has dropped the
Honor System as a part of the institution and gone
back to the old style of examination under the super
vision of faculty. The taking of the Honor System
from the students of Wharton has come as a result
of "reticence to report" on the part of students who
see that things are not all right in the classrooms, but
fear to incur the dislike of some of their fellows by
reporting them to the council in charge of adminis
tration of the penalties for violations.
An excerpt from the Cornell Sun of February 16
comments upon the situation at Wharton and how
it applies to Cornell. Our interest is the same as
Cornell, and we may well think over the thought that
is brought out in the following editorial because our
Honor System, like theirs, is in the formative period.
The case is just one more bit of evidence that an Honor
System is nothing more than the students make it. No con
stitution, no chain of committees, 110 exposition of high ideals
can make it foolproof. Honor, not the system, puts a stop to
cheating. Once the honor becomes defunct, the constitution
is not worth the paper it is written on.
."Repeated violations" and "reticence to report'—these
sounded the death knell at the Wharton School. The first is
a simple matter of dishonesty, which either exists or does
not exist. At present very little of it exists at Cornell, and
011 that score our system is safe for the time being. But
"reticence to report" is another story. Although a number
of cases have recently been reported, there is still much of
the old unwillingness to "tell tales' 011 a fellow student. Re
porting a violation is not yet generally accepted as quite the

proper thing to do; there is still an idea that to report a man
is to strike him in the back. On this almost as much as 011
honesty itself will depend in the long run the success or
failure of the system. When the cheat has no trouble "get
ting away with it," the code is open to all kinds of abuse—and
abuse it will get.
The rights and wrongs of reporting will always he a fruit
ful subject for argument. The determined opponent, per
haps, can not be convinced; but he can be made to feel him
self hopelessly outvoted. It is all a question of what comes
to the accepted attitude. On this point we are still in the
formative period, and for the success of the system it is
essential that opinion as finally crystalized give the cheat no
encouragement.
The experience of the Wharton School is a good example
for Cornell not to follow. It serves as a warning of some of
the dangers which will follow a slackening of the honor
sentiment here. Our system, like any other, can not live long
on its reputation.
