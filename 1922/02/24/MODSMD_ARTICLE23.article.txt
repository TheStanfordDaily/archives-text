The worst case has been found. All honors go to the
freshman found by the Libe reading room waiting for
someone to open up. He just knew the place was
closed. Wasn't there a sign on the door that said
"OUT"?

Now that California guard was sure tired, judging
from his PANTS. Doctor's report would read "Irregular
and falling, but never getting out of control."

It is perhaps as well that men's clothingstores do not
advertise as do the shops catering to women. For ex
ample, our leading merchant could hand us something
like this:
"A smartly cut piece of goods, sewed together in the
proper places, made with a distinct check of black and
white about four inches square; is the latest model from
our exclusive pattern shop. Starting at the rear collar
button the lines divide, running both ways around the
neck and meeting somewhere in the vicinity of the top
vest button. Here they run parallel for some distance,
varying with the individual, reaching a point even lower
than this in some cases. Here they again separate, run
ning back on either side of the body and meeting at a
point directly below the starting point. These lines,
when filled with cloth, form the coat. The trousers are
beyond description. A new feature of our coats is the
way of attaching pockets. These are put in upside
down in order to keep out the rain. The result is
guaranteed to cause a sensation.

Thursday got a bit under the weather this week,
which caused him to indite the.following:
According to sporting write-ups this pre-Spring
weather is the occasion of a good deal of indisposition.
The country's dry, oh me, oh my!
I've got to have a drink.
To get my rye I'll have to try,
Some way I'll have to think.
What will I do? I'll get the "flu,"
The doc will give me some,
I've said adieu but will be true
To my dear partner, Rum.
Said Doc, "All right. Just take a mite,
I hope 'twill cure the thing:"
I wished delight, but ah, good night,
One swallow's not a Spring.

They sit all around me
In the Library. And they think that
I am studying, and writing something
Important.
They don't guess that
I aijV merely killing time
LTntil the little blond leaves
And then I can rush out and
Hold the door open for her!

Yes, I am a Ffreshman.

We always knew that we had art in us somewhere.
Now that we have taken the proper history course in
appreciation of art. we realize as never before the value
of the following picture of two black cats fighting in a
dark tunnel.

Nipped in the Bud.
The tale is a sad one, as sad as you've heard.
I'll truly admit that it sounds quite absurd,
But all of this happened, in times long ago.
When Earth was infested with monsters that grow
To mountainous sizes, then bent to the ground
To swallow the humans that happened around.
When Venus de Milo, of fabled renown.
Was woo'd by a certain young man of her town.
She answered him warmly, and hearing them speak.
The neighbors guessed marriage inside of a week.
But one quiet evening while taking a walk,
They stopped by a fountain to have a quiet talk.
She gave him her promise, but 10, at their heel,
A vicious old monster came tracking his meal!
He roared as he spied them. (Atidbit indeed)
But due to poor eyesight—perhaps to his speed.
He missed their location and making a whirl,
Just swallowed the lover —and arms of the girl!
She listlessly wandered away from the place,
And soon dropped from sight in the hurrying race;
But yet there's a moral —for women who can.
DON'T EVER BE HASTY IN LOVING YOUR MAN!
