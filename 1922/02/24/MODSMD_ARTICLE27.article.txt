## 
### 
A compromise was effected by Eu
phronia members on the question "Re
solved, that all gum champers should be
hung," which was debated at a meeting
last night. The decision was that a more
capital punishment than hanging was
necessary, and that the offenders should
therefore be made to chew perpetually,
their funerals being no exception. Movie
■gum parkers were excluded from this
category because of intense feeling, and
it was agreed that they should be junt
plain hung.
The affirmative won the decision in the
other debate scheduled, "Resolved, that
capital punishment should be abolished
in the State of California." The winning
arguments, made by H. C. Coblentz and
G. C. Darrah, were from the historical
standpoint, and to the effect that there
was, for most criminals, a chance for
reformation, and that segregation was al
ready provided for the demented type.
The negative, A. L. Crawford and N. F.
Main, argued that capital punishment
was the most expedient method of deal
ing with the criminal class, and that ths
present system, which left the decision to
the jury, was satisfactory.
R. C. Binkley was chosen to take the
place of P. I. Spencer on the Euphronia
debating squad which will meet St.
Mary's on March 4 in the semi-finals of
