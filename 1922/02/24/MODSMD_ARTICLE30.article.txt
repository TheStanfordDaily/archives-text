tory Department, entitled "Japan and the
United States," has lately been published
in the North China Diflly News, the old
est and most influential newspaper in
China. The reviewer pays a very high
tribute to Professor Treat, claiming that
his book ought to be made a textbook in
all Chinese schools which teach the sub
ject of modern history. He also pays a
very flattering compliment to the spirit
of Stanford.
In speaking of the contents of the book,
which consists of twelve lectures deliv
ered by Professor Treat on his trip
through the Orient at four of the lead
ing Chinese universities, the reviewer
says:"It is a great pity that the lec
tures have not also been delivered at
every one of the Chinese universities. It
certainly ought to be translated into Chi
nese and be a textbook in all schools in
which modern history is taught."
He goes on to praise the attitude of
Professor-Treat and of the university as
follows: "In this book we have the work
of a university professor whose aim is the
very simple one of investigation of the
truth. Stanford University is not an in
stitution which muzzles its professors and
compels them to write in accordance with
the ideas of the government of the day.
It appoints honest men to the various
chairs and gives them full scope for the
publication of the results o ftheir investi
gations."
