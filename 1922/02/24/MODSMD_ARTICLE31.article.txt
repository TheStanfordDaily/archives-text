## 
### 
Proof that Stanford has turned out
more all-around*athletes than California
is shown by a comparison of the rec
ords of "Brick"' Morse, who last week
broke out with a statement tnat there
were only three men who had ever made
their "big C" in thre sports, and of
records of the Stanford Physical Edu
cation, which show nine men who have
won the block "S" for competition in
three major sports, two of whom won
it in four branches. The San Francisco
writer gives as the first one on his list
one "Brick" Morse, followed by "Loco
motive" Smith, then Cort Majors, with
"Brick" Muller as a present prospect.
The nine men whom records show to
have competed against California in
three branches of major sport are:
Charley Adams, '96; Lewis Freeman, '00;
Alex Chalmers, '07 \ "Reg" Caughey, '18;
Ken Lilly, '19 (four sports) ; Bob Pe
louze, '19 (four sports) ; George Davis,
'20; and Fred Adams, '21.
