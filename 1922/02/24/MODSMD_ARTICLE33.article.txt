# JAPANESE PRINTS TO BE EXHIBITED BY DR. J.M. STILLMAN
## 
### 
Beginning Sunday, Dr. John Maxson
Stillnian, formerly vice-president of
Stanford, will exhibit an unique collec
tion of about one hundred Japanese
prints, in the Stanford Memorial Am
Gallery.
It is interesting to note that these
prints are not made on a press, as even
the color is put on by hand. The sub
jects are painted on a thin piece of Jap
anese paper, then glued in reverse on a
slab of wood. The Japanese engraver
cuts out all that is not subject to the
inked impression.
The Japanese and Oriental art is more
idealistic and not limited by a naturalistic
taste. In many of them, the colors are
subdued, due to their age, and to the fact
that they are the products of the older
masters.
Dr. Stillman's collection, which com
prises in all more than 500 Japanese
prints, is considered the second most val
uable in the State of California.
