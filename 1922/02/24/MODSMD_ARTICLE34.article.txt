# S's Lead Bawl-Out League; U's Rate Bottom of Ladder

### 
Not to be outdone by the "Startled
Sequoia Statistician," the Bawl-Out
Fiend has hunted around with measur
ing tape and a pair of smoked glasses,
and has uncovered some hair-raising in
formation that doesn't all come after
the students' names.
In the first place, it is an ascertained
fact that if tlje names of every student,
as printed in the Directory, were placed
end to end and not tampered with, so
that they would get out of alignment,
the straight line resulting would reach
150 feet, 1 inch out into space.
In the next place, do you know
whether or not you belong to the most
numerous group in the University, ac
cording to the letter your last name
starts with? If your name is Smith,
or Strong, or even Stace (which it is
not, if you're registered), you have the
honor of belonging to the group of S's,
of which there are 294 enrolled at Stan
ford. The M's come a close second,
with 290 (this includes all Mc's and
Mac's), while the B's are a rather poor
third, dragging along with only 271.
Next, in the order of their numbers
enrolled, come H, C, W. P, G, L, D,
R, T, F, K, A, E. J. N. V, O. I. Y, Q,
Z, and U. The U's have the cellar cham
pionship with a total of 6. The Q's and
Z's fight it out for runners-up for last
place with 8 apiece.
The only letter not represented is X.
