# DEAN CULVER SPEAKS AT INTERFRATERNITY SMOKER OF FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Dean George B. Culver and Professor
William B. Owens were the speakers
at a get-together smokes given for fra
ternity freshmen by the Interfraternity
Conference in the Union last night.
Dean Culver spoke of the value of the
fraternity to the university, and of the
potentialities of the Interfraternity Con
ference. He suggested ways of over
coming the liquor and tubbing problems.
Tubbing, he said, is usually one of the
most unwarranted of college customs,
and recommended to the freshmen that
when they become upperclassmen they
tind other ways of disciplining.
Professor Owens outlined some of
the present day problems of fraternities.
One of the most important of these is
to raise the fraternity man in the es
teem of the public. â€¢ A stigma cast upon
one fraternity man not only reflects on
bis group, but all fraternities as well.
Pete Starr, '25, gave several piano
selections; and apples, sandwiches, corn
cobs, and cider were distributed at the
conclusion of the speaking.
