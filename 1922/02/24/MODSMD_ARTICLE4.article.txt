# Do Students Ever Think? Well, Why Should They? At That, They Used To
## 
### 
A line question! How should we
know, anyway? Of course, anybody
could answer it after a moment's thought.
A symposium (you know what that is)
will be conducted by Professor R. M.
Alden of the English department on the
question — hold everything, men — "Do
Stanford Students Think?" in the Feb
ruary issue of the Cardinal, on sale Mon
day. Bruce Driven, '11, editor of the New
York Globe, ably answers this question
with the statement "Why should they?"
Among the other replies is a come-back
by one reputed to be well known among
bis acquaintances, who says "They used
to."
The February Cardinal is edited by the
faculty, and will also contain a two-page
exerpt from Melville Best Anderson's
translation of Dante's "Divina Corn
media," a poem by Frank Hill, '11, edi
torial writer of the New York Golhe, an
article by Professor ]. S. P. Tatlock on
the Dante Centenary, and a one-act play
entitled "A Balcony Scene."
