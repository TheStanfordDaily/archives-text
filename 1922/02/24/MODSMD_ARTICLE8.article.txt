# VAGABOND POET'S VERSES COMPRISE BASIS OF DRAMA
## English Club Play Is Centered Around Thrilling Episodes in Francois Villon's Life 
### 
"If I were king—ah love, if I were j
king!
What tributary nations would 1 bring
To stoop before your sceptre and to
swear
Allegiance to your lips and eyes and
hair.
Beneath your feet what treasures
would I fling:—
.J lie stars should be your pearls upon a
string,
I lie world a ruby for your linger ring, |
And you should have the sun and moon j
to wear
If 1 were king."
Francois Villon, the vagabond poet of
mediaeval France, wrote those lines, and j
they will lie repeated in English Club's j
historical representation of the play in '
which he is the leading character.
King Louis chances to overhear Villon
telling his comrades what lie would do i
if he were on the throne and gives the
poet the opportunity to carry out his
plans by appointing him Grand Constable
of France for ten days. At the end of
that period, Villon's last act is to hang
himself, unless in the meantime he wins
the love of Lady Katherine du Vaucelles,
highest in the court. When Lady Kath
erine learns the constable's true identity,
she disdains him and the last act of "If I
Were King" takes places in the shadow
of the gibbet. Dramatic episodes fill the
moments while the flickering candle
which decides the time of Villon's death
burns down and it is in the spectacular
climax of these episodes that he is finally
saved.
The part of Lady Katherine will be
taken by Violet Andrews and calls for
genuine dramatic ability.
Helen Whitney is cast for the other
female lead, Huguette, the woman of the

streets, whose love for Francois finally
ends in her receiving the dagger which
was meant for him and dying with his
name on her lips.
The emotions of these two women and
of the romantic rogue Villon run through
a series of intensely dramatic and spec
tacular incidents, which tax the ability
of actors and actresses, stage designers,
costumers, and technicians. The flash of
swords and the cries of mobs provide a
spirit of pageantry throughout the four
acts. ,
