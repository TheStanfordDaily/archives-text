# ANNUAL MILITARY BALL WILL BE GALA EVENT
## First Formal of Quarter Will Be Open to Entire Campus 
### 
Completely decorated with flags and
illumined subtley by concealed lights, the
basketball pavilion will be thrown open a
week from tonight, Friday evening,
March 3, for the Military Ball, the first
formal to be held in the new structure,
one which the military department be
lieves will be unrivaled this spring. The
Ambrose Whitmer ten-piece orchestra
has been engaged for the evening, and the
latest numbers featuring stunt work on
the bass viol will be the inspiration for
the dances, which will begin at 9 and last
until 1. To insure plenty of room for the
dancers, the tickets, which are now on
sale at the bookstore, have been limited to
300 in number.
Richard Faville has the general chair
manship of the dance committees as a
whole, with the following chairmen of
the sub-committees: Taylor, refresh
ments; DeGroot, music; Patterson,
David, publicity; Gunther, finance, and
Cleveland, programs.
The cost of tickets has been set at
$3.50, with any surplus over expenses re
verting to the endowment fund.
Officers attached to the Ninth Corps
headquarters in San Francisco are to be
accorded invitations, and all R. O. T. C.
members and others on the campus in
terested in the military organization will
have an opportunity to attend.
So far as possible, it is planned that all
those connected with the military will ap
pear in uniform, and the military de
partment has expressed a desire to aid all
those under its jurisdiction in properly
outfitting themselves for the occasion.
