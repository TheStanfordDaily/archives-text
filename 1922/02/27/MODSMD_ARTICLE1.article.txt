# CARDINAL VARSITY QUINTET DROPS SECOND CONTEST TO CALIFORNIA BY TEN POINTS
## Blue and Gold Five Captures Series With 27 to 17 Victory; Stanford Threatens Near Close of Battle 
### Garrett Elmore, ’23 
To California belongs a27 to 17 victory and the spoils, which consist of
the 1922 basketball supremacy between the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold.
The majority of the 7500 spectators which filled the Oakland Auditorium
Saturday night, expected to see the Bruins win decisively, and they were
not disappointed. With superior weight and experience, the Califronia var
sity play by play overcame the strong resistance offered by Van Gent's
basketers and earned their second ten-point victory over Stanford this year.
There was nothing disappointing in the showing of the Cardinal. To them
had been conceded that ever-present "fighting chance." They didn't convert
it into a victory because it was physically impossible. The Bruins saw to
that. The Stanford five was twenty-five per cent better than three weeks
ago, but California had improved more than that. There is but one reason
for the defeat of the Cardinals, and that is because they met a better and
bigger team.
Most of the spectators went home, however, believing more than ever

in the saying that in football and
basketball a good little team cafinot
beat a good big one.
Neither aggregation could have been
called a"court machine", Saturday
night. The pace was too hot, the
movements of the players too hurried
for the game to be much more than a
mad scramble after the ball.
Stanford Rallies
The Cardinal did not win, but it
unloosed a drive that swept the Blue
and Gold before it in the final min
utes of the contest. Cardinal stock
had touched bottom five minutes be
fore the end of fray. Janssen re-enter
ed the contest, and things turned from
bitter to sweet for Stanford adherents.
A 23 to 11 score did not phase in
the least the five Cardinal basket tos
sers. Davies coolly tossed his sixth
free throw of the evening, and Rogers
caged a pretty try from near the cen
ter of the court. The teams lined up
and Richmond made one of the special
long shots. Davies converted another
free throw. That made the score 23
to 17, and the Blue and Gold appeared
to be routed. It was only a question
of whether there would be time enough
for Stanford to continue its onslaught.
But time out was called and the
Stanford quintet lost its magic. The
Bruins came out of their lethargy and
held Van Gent's five scoreless, while
they made four more points.
Eggleston, Talt Shine
Art Eggleston, versatile running
guard of Wight's outfit, and John Talt,
forward, were the villains, as far as
Stanford was concerned.
Eggleston was right at home on the
Auditorum court, and he tossed three
field goals, besides putting a damper
on the Cardinal attack. Talt was his
co-partner in rolling up the Bruin
score, for the crack forward caged
four goals from field and five free
throws for a total of thirteen.
In Again, Out Again
The Cardinal quintet presented a
varied front throughout the contest.
Rogers started at forward, but Mc-
Hose relieved him when the half was
two-thirds over. Anderson played a
bang-up game on the defense when he
went in for Janssen, who had three
personal fouls called on him in the
first period. Janssen and Rogers re
turned after the second half was un
der way and finished the game.
De Groot kept the Blue and Gold
forwards away from the Stanford
basket and performed his task of
"feeding" the Cardinal attack in good
shape. Stanford excelled California
in converting free throws, for Davies
made seven out of nine attempts,
while Talt, who did the hurling from
the gift line for the Bruins, missed
five out of ten. Rogers, McHose, and
Richmond played better basketball
than they have all season, but the
size of the handicap was too much to
overcome.
Teams Deadlocked
There was little to choose between
the fives in the first eight minutes of
play. Two points apiece were the
fruits of their efforts as far as gather
ing the points was concerned. Then
the Bruins started. Douthit and Talt
contributed two and three points re
spectively. Stanford came back at the
Bears, Davies making a field goal and
a foul. The score was 7 to 5.
Coop, sent in for Douhit, got
loose and caged one, but Davies an
nexed one more point on a free throw.
Talt then got in his deadly work, the
husky forward scoring two goals from
field in quick succession, and one free
throw. McHose tallied two points for
the Cardinal. The score at half was
16 to 8.
Bruins Continue Rampage
The second half started as if there
was to be a slaughter with the Stan
ford basketers as the victims. Talt
made two on a double foul. But Mc-
Hose came back with a goal after
some nice passing under the Califor
nia basket. Davies converted a foul,
bringing the count up to 18 to 11.
Coop and Eggleston broke away from
the Stanford defense for a basket
apiece. Then Stanford rallied and
came within six points of the Bears,
only to have the latter stop the rout
and recover their ten point lead:
