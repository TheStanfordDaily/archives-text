# CARDINAL VARSITY QUINTET DROPS SECOND CONTEST TO CALIFORNIA BY TEN POINTS
## Blue and Gold Five Captures Series With 27 to 17 Victory; Stanford Threatens Near Close of Battle 
### Garrett Elmore, â€™23 
To California belongs a27 to 17 victory and the spoils, which consist of
the 1922 basketball supremacy between the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold.
The majority of the 7500 spectators which filled the Oakland Auditorium
Saturday night, expected to see the Bruins win decisively, and they were
not disappointed. With superior weight and experience, the Califronia var
sity play by play overcame the strong resistance offered by Van Gent's
basketers and earned their second ten-point victory over Stanford this year.
There was nothing disappointing in the showing of the Cardinal. To them
had been conceded that ever-present "fighting chance." They didn't convert
it into a victory because it was physically impossible. The Bruins saw to
that. The Stanford five was twenty-five per cent better than three weeks
ago, but California had improved more than that. There is but one reason
for the defeat of the Cardinals, and that is because they met a better and
bigger team.
Most of the spectators went home, however, believing more than ever

in the saying that in football and
basketball a good little team cafinot
beat a good big one.
Neither aggregation could have been
called a"court machine", Saturday
night. The pace was too hot, the
movements of the players too hurried
for the game to be much more than a
mad scramble after the ball.
Stanford Rallies
The Cardinal did not win, but it
unloosed a drive that swept the Blue
and Gold before it in the final min
utes of the contest. Cardinal stock
had touched bottom five minutes be
fore the end of fray. Janssen re-enter
ed the contest, and things turned from
bitter to sweet for Stanford adherents.
A 23 to 11 score did not phase in
the least the five Cardinal basket tos
sers. Davies coolly tossed his sixth
free throw of the evening, and Rogers
caged a pretty try from near the cen
ter of the court. The teams lined up
and Richmond made one of the special
long shots. Davies converted another
free throw. That made the score 23
to 17, and the Blue and Gold appeared
to be routed. It was only a question
of whether there would be time enough
for Stanford to continue its onslaught.
But time out was called and the
Stanford quintet lost its magic. The
Bruins came out of their lethargy and
held Van Gent's five scoreless, while
they made four more points.
