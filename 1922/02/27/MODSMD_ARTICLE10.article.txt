# BABE STICKSTERS DEFEAT BERKELEY
## 
### R.H. Edwards, ’24 
!• rcslimen diamond men chalked up an
other victory over a bay region prep
school nine when they defeated Berkeley
V High in a slow game, 10-4, Saturday
afternoon. The morning contest sched
uled with Polytechnic High was post
poned.
Consistent hitting by the yearling but
ters was largely responsible for the Card
success. The Freshmen drove Berkeley's
first-string pitcher out of the box in the
second inning, and collected four good
hits from the next twirler, a southpaw.
Eight out of nine Freshmen clicked out a
hit, with two bingles credited to Mul
; cliev and a riple to McCandless. Solo
! man tool' the, mound for Stanford and
pitched live innings. Teague finished the
game, Soloman allowed only two hits,
which were not converted into runs. But
five walks and four errors by the inlield
enabled the Berkeleyites to score their
only runs, one in the third inning and
three in the fifth. Both teams presented
a rather poor exhibition of fielding, the
Freshmen playing much below their
I usual standard.
