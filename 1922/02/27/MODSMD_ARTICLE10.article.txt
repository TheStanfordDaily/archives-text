# BABE STICKSTERS DEFEAT BERKELEY
## 
### R.H. Edwards, ’24 
!• rcslimen diamond men chalked up an
other victory over a bay region prep
school nine when they defeated Berkeley
V High in a slow game, 10-4, Saturday
afternoon. The morning contest sched
uled with Polytechnic High was post
poned.
Consistent hitting by the yearling but
ters was largely responsible for the Card
success. The Freshmen drove Berkeley's
first-string pitcher out of the box in the
second inning, and collected four good
hits from the next twirler, a southpaw.
Eight out of nine Freshmen clicked out a
hit, with two bingles credited to Mul
; cliev and a riple to McCandless. Solo
! man tool' the, mound for Stanford and
pitched live innings. Teague finished the
game, Soloman allowed only two hits,
which were not converted into runs. But
five walks and four errors by the inlield
enabled the Berkeleyites to score their
only runs, one in the third inning and
three in the fifth. Both teams presented
a rather poor exhibition of fielding, the
Freshmen playing much below their
I usual standard.
Early spring base-cleaning by the 1925
| batsmen in the second inning netted six
runs. Mulchey, first man up, drew a
walk and stole second, advancing to third
on a single by McDonald. Mulchey
scored on Connor's scratch hit to short
stop. Both McDonald and Connor
crossed the plate when the third baseman
fielded Soloman's grounder and over
threw first. Lavvson reached first on a
fielder's choice, and Roberts walked.
Soloman went home on a wild pitch, and
Cuddeback's sacrifice brought in Lawson.
Mulchey came to bat for the second time
during the inning and connected for a
bingle which scored Roberts.
Berkeley made a run iil the next frame.
Murphy walked, reached third on a wild
pitch and a catcher's error, and spiked
the plate when Morse sacrificed. Stan
ford came back strong in the same in
ning. Connor was safe at first on the
shortstop's error, and Soloman singled to
right field. Both runners were brought
home when Roberts drove the hall into
the left garden.
In the fourth frame Mulchey singled,
and McCandless followed him to the
plate, swatting the southpaw's offering
for a three-bagger.
The Cardinal infield staged a blow-up
and some of Soloman's glory faded when
the prep men next came to bat. Three
walks and four infield errors was a let
down which Berkeley took advantage of
to the tune of three tallies.
Kallam's men made no hits and 110 runs
until the eighth period. With two away,
Johnston hit safely and scorcd on Mlll
chey's muffed grounder. Teague struck
out two Berkeley men in their last at
tempt at bat.
