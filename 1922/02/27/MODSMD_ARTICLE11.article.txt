# DEPARTMENT ESTABLISHED IN CLASSICAL LITERATURE
## 
### 
The Departments of Greek and Latin
at Stanford have been merged into a
single Department of Classical Litera
ture, and the new department will lay
stress on the civilization and culture of
the Greeks and Romans as well as offer
courses in the ancient languages and in
the literature written in these languages.
"The uniting of the two departments,"
said President Wilbur, "is only carrying
on a line of development which they have
both been working out for a number of
years. It seemed to theni that they
could get better rounded and better co
ordinated courses if they joined forces
in a single department.
"The intellectual interest in Greek and
Roman studies and their value in show

ing the sources of much of our modern
civilization have led to both departments
giving a considerable number of courses
of benefit to the general student whose
special interests were not along the lines
of the languages themselves, ft is hoped
that expanding and co-ordinating such
courses will bring a still larger number
of students into contact with these funda
mental civilizations.
"The term Classical Literature was se
lected as a convenient name to indicate
in a general way the scope of the de
partment. In addition to the Greek and
Latin languages, the program will in
clude courses in literature, history, phil
osophy, archaeology, art. and any other
subjects lying in this field."
