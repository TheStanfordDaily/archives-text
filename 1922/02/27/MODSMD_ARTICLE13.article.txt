# HENRY LANZ TO BE HEARD IN RECITAL
## Russian Compositions Will be Feature of Tuesday Lecture in Little Theatre Tomorrow 
### 
Dr. Henry Lanz of the Slavic Lan
guage departmetn will give a lecture
recital in the Little Theater at 7:30 to
morrow evening.
Dr. Lanz will give an introductory talk
on the history of Russian music. Its de
velopment has been closely allied with
the history of the peasants of that coun
try. Up to the beginning of the nine
teenth century little attention was paid
to the cultivation of musical ability
among the Russians. There existed at
that time almost no music by Russian
composers except folk songs and church
melodies. Dr. Lanz believes that the suc
cess of the modern Russian music is due
to its peculiar development. He will play
typical examples of these old folk and
church melodies.
A short program of works of the mod
ern composers will then be given. Dr.
Lanz has included in it selections from
Rubinstein, Skrjabin, Borodin and others
whom he considers representative of the
Russian school of music. He will play
numbers which he thinks are most aypical
of the composer and which contain the
most appeal for the American public.
The following program will be given:
Kramennoi Ostrov (Rocky Isle)
Rubinstein
Troika Tchaikowsky
At the Convent Borodin
Song of India Rimsky-Korsakov
Prelude No. 8 Skrjabin
Prelude in C sharp minor
Rachmaninoff
