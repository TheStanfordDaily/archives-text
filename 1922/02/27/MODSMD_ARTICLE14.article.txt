# King Calls Court In Weird Places To Plan Intrigues
## 
### 
King Louis and his court of French
lords and ladies have been assembled
every night on the campus for the past
three weeks. Sometimes the King sum
mons his court to gather in the lobby ot
the Zoology Building; sometimes the
King and his court meet and plan their
intrigues in th* basement of the Engi
neering Building; but most of time
King Louis prefers to fight his duels and
plan his battles in the Assembly Hall.
Even on the holiday of February 22 the
King ordered his subjects to present
themselves before his throne. Str;fhge,
is it not, that a sovereign and his favor
ites should have so little leisure?
Now the power behind the throne is
Coach Gordon Davis, who has forced the
King to call his court together for re
hearsals, and who is striving to give an
artistic and finished representation of
life at a French court and in the taverns
in the coming play, "If I Were King."
The stage setting will be an accurate re
production of the castles and Paris street
scenes during mediaeval France; the
costumes will be authentic as well as pic
turesque.
