# FIRST REPORTS OF BUSINESS MEN SHOW $40,180 PLEDGED
## 
### 
Business men of Palo Alto, in their
first endowment campaign report
meeting, Saturday night, turned in
pledges amounting to $40,120. About
one-third of the list to be canvassed
was estimated as being seen. The
eight captains made individual reports
of their canvass, new cards were
distributed, and plant made to turn
in final reports Wednesday.
Charmain Alfred Seade, in comment
ing on the progress of the campaign,
said: "If this campaign is demonstrat
ing nothing else but that the business
men of this city would enthusiastically
and unitedly support a program for
a bigger, better, and busier Palo Alto,
it would be worth all the thought,
time, and effort put into it. With
work just fairly begun, we have to
report nearly half of our set quota."
Progress in the work was reported
enthusiastically by the captains of the
different sections. W. O. Horabin said,
in turning in his pledges: "Our work
has been a pleasure—people expected
us, and it was simply a matter of how
much should be subscribed." D. A.
Mendenhall declared that "there are
absolutely no rebuffs —people regret
that they cannot give more." M. H.
Buchan gave as his opinion that any
criticism of the University which
might have developed—although none
had come to him —should have no con
sideration in this campaign, for, he
said, the University is bigger than any
of its departments, its executive lead
ers, its past or present. "The future
of the University," he said, "is assured
only by hearty and enthusiastic co
operation of the business men, alumni,
and distant, though active, friends."
