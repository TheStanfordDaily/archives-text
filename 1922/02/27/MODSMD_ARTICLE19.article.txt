# WATCH YOUR TIME
## 
### 
The time of smokeups for the quarter having come
and passed, many students are singing the same old
song that is always chanted at this time of the term.
They are saying to themselves and to others that
there is no justice in the system of education, and
that they haven't had a chance to show their stuff.
Some, however, are looking deeper into the reason
why they have gotten the little blue cards and are
seeing that although they have put in many hours on
the Quad and in the Library they have not been con
centrating while they spent this so-called study time.
Where there are many things to take a student's
interest off his work he is prone to shirk any real
accomplishment even while he is putting in enough
time to do all that he has set himself to perform.
This is the case mostly where the person is studying
because he thinks himself hound in conscience to put
in the time "hitting the books." Passing time in
nothing more than reading the text of the assigned
lesson is time lost in the worst way, because if taken
out in relaxation or some sport it would at least be a
benefit to the body, while here there is no good done
in any way either mentally or physically.
The social side of wasting time is brought out in
the following clipping from The University Daily
Kansan, entitled "The Value of Time":
We are informed in a recent news dispatch that Thomas
A. Edison, 011 the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday, was
just two hours late to his office.
Here is some very fair food for thought. Much time has
been spent, much very probably wasted, in attempting to
analyze the causes of great success. Here is one fundamental
cause of one of our Nation's greatest successes, fairly thrown
in our faces.
He knew the value of time! At his seventy-fifth birthday
he still knows it. His life, already a wonderful success
measured by any standards you care to apply, is now one de
voted entirely to service. To render this service, he needs
time. And he has learned to take advantage of every bit
available.
This lesson comes very close to us of the university, and
110 doubt to the students of all universities. It is not a too
daring statement to say that there is more time wasted in the
educational institutions of the country than any other one
place. It is more dangerous because of the fact that so
much of it is hidden behind the cloak of the "social side"
of collegiate development. There is this social side, but it
lias become too much a cloud that has hidden from the stu
dents of today any realization of the value of time.
It is not the "social side" of college lite, in most
cases, that interferes with our studyâ€”not "social life,
at least, in the usual and restricted meaning of that
term, implying continuous formal entertainment and
parties. That is the cause of downfall in relatively
few cases.
The thing which is the most likely to cause harm
is the loitering when thinking that we are working
hard in the preparation of our subjects. It is easy
to stop and talk to our neighbor in the next chair or
to run down for a friendly smoke and a peek or two
at the passing show. It is this interference with
preparation which puts studies on the bum and makes
it so hard to figure why the smoke-ups always come
home to roost just about this time in the quarter.
