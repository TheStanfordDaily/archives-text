The guy we recommend for capital punishment is the
gent who is so dumb he thinks Glenn Wamer invented
speedometers.

However, the Stanford football machine, model 1922,
Warner starting system installed, will probably have
a good pick-up, and quite a few shifts, although no re

TWENTY YEARS HENCE:
(A Look Into the Future)
The men's council recommended today that twelve
hours be added to the graduation of a student because
he was found walking on the Quad with his vest un
buttoned.

Only eighty-seven parts have been allotted for the
next English Club play, "When I Was King." The other
hundred and twenty three parts will be given out next
week. Tryouts have been in progress two weeks now,
and only 1456 candidates have shown up. With more
material coming up next week, some good selections
will undoubtedly be made.

The freshman-sophomore tea fight ended in an un
sightly brawl yesterday afternoon when the first-year
men asked for the sugar. The faculty is taking under
consideration the matter of changing the rules or some
thing.

Intramural bridge started yesterday afternoon by a
victory of 3 games plus 10 honors by Team No. 1* from
Dormitory No. 89, over Team No. 7, from Hall 86. The
game was close throughout, but tended to lag. Blagg,
the winner's most consistent performer, had a habit
of marking the cards that puzzled the referee. He was
finally retired from the game on personal fouls. The
winner in each league will be presented with a hand
painted deck of cards, in a glass oase.

BOOK REVIEW
"Inside Secrets of a Professor's Life," by An Anony
mous Student. (Price, two quarts, F. O. B. San Fran
cisco. Telephone S. F. L-lll).
* * »
This book is one of the most startling that has been
released for several days,' and in it the author tells
about a lot of things we suspect he doesn't know. Does
a professor eat? Why? Does he have any friends, or
is he like an umpire? All these questions, and many
others, the author answers in a way that is at once
convincing and unreliable.
This book is well worth the price as it burns slowly,
and the cloth covers can be used for pie-crusts.

The Chemistry Department has purchased a new
Cathemometer... Just after the big agitation against ex
pensive automobiles, too!

Health Hints for the Bad Weather
How to keep dry^ —Put on a big sealskin coat and a
sombrero. Pour melted paraffiin over yourself until
you are incased in a water-proof transparent mixture.
Then stay in the house.
* * *
To mend an umbrella: —Take a piece of inner-tube
and paste it over the hole in the umbrella. Paint it
black to match with the rest of the umbrella. Take it
to a restaurant and exchange it for a good umbrella.
* * m
To avoid the Grippe:—Take a dose of arsenic and
go to the hospital. You will receive the best of care
there, and will be in no danger of catching cold.
* * *
To keep from getting the feet wet: —Walk on stilts.
* * *
When they get that new theater finished in Palo Alto,
perhaps they'll give special rain-checks to the gents
that have to occupy Rows 1, 2, 345, 346. Big money
could be made in the opera-glass business if the movie
houses should get much larger.
* * V
Hints on Etiquette:—lf you drop your knife at the
dinner table, don't pick it up again unless the prongs
aren't bent.
m * *
Never pass the jam when you want all that's left. It
isn't good for the conscience.
* # n
Don't fold your napkin as you were hanging out the
family washing.
* » *
Don't talk with your mouth full unless you know the
deaf and dumb language.

The Statistic Fiend has compiled a list of the different
kinds of cigarettes that are smoked on the campus,
and at the same time he noticed who did and who didn't
say hello. It was found that 86 per cent of those who
had cigarettes in their mouths failed to speak. The
one that didn't have any cig was too young to talk.

had cigarettes in their mouths failed to speak. The

BOOK REVIEW
"Inside Secrets of a Professor's Life," by An Anony
mous Student. (Price, two quarts, F. O. B. San Fran
cisco. Telephone S. F. L-lll).
* * »
This book is one of the most startling that has been
released for several days,' and in it the author tells
about a lot of things we suspect he doesn't know. Does
a professor eat? Why? Does he have any friends, or
is he like an umpire? All these questions, and many
others, the author answers in a way that is at once
convincing and unreliable.
This book is well worth the price as it burns slowly,
and the cloth covers can be used for pie-crusts.

Health Hints for the Bad Weather
How to keep dry^ —Put on a big sealskin coat and a
sombrero. Pour melted paraffiin over yourself until
you are incased in a water-proof transparent mixture.
Then stay in the house.
* * *
To mend an umbrella: —Take a piece of inner-tube
and paste it over the hole in the umbrella. Paint it
black to match with the rest of the umbrella. Take it
to a restaurant and exchange it for a good umbrella.
* * m
To avoid the Grippe:—Take a dose of arsenic and
go to the hospital. You will receive the best of care
there, and will be in no danger of catching cold.
* * *
To keep from getting the feet wet: —Walk on stilts.

When they get that new theater finished in Palo Alto,

The Statistic Fiend has compiled a list of the different
kinds of cigarettes that are smoked on the campus,
and at the same time he noticed who did and who didn't
say hello. It was found that 86 per cent of those who
had cigarettes in their mouths failed to speak. The
one that didn't have any cig was too young to talk.

Intramural bridge started yesterday afternoon by a
victory of 3 games plus 10 honors by Team No. 1* from
Dormitory No. 89, over Team No. 7, from Hall 86. The
game was close throughout, but tended to lag. Blagg,
the winner's most consistent performer, had a habit
of marking the cards that puzzled the referee. He was
finally retired from the game on personal fouls. The
winner in each league will be presented with a hand
painted deck of cards, in a glass oase.

BOOK REVIEW
"Inside Secrets of a Professor's Life," by An Anony
mous Student. (Price, two quarts, F. O. B. San Fran
cisco. Telephone S. F. L-lll).
* * »
This book is one of the most startling that has been
released for several days,' and in it the author tells
about a lot of things we suspect he doesn't know. Does
a professor eat? Why? Does he have any friends, or
is he like an umpire? All these questions, and many
others, the author answers in a way that is at once
convincing and unreliable.
This book is well worth the price as it burns slowly,
and the cloth covers can be used for pie-crusts.
