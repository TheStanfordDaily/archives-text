Next Saturday evening at 8:15, the
Stanford Glee Club will appear before

the season, which will be given in the
Stanford Assembly Hall.
Tickets have been placed on sale in the
office of the Alumni Secretary and at
Crandall's in Palo Alto.
On Friday evening, the group will ap
pear at San Jose in a concert at the State
reachors' College. On Tuesday evening,
March 7, a concert will be given at Scot
tish Rite Auditorium in San Francisco.
In their concert next Saturday evening
Mrs. Esther Houk Allen, contralto, well
known to local music followers, will ap
pear as guest soloist of the club. Marsden
Argall, baritone, and Richard Malaby,
pianist, are other well-known campus
musicians who will also appear with the
club throughout the season.
Ihe Pacific Musical Review compli
mented the organization, saying, "The
soloists sing like artists, the chorus ex
presses itself with musicianly skill. The
enunciation is clear and distinct, and we
do not hesitate to say that the Stanford
Glee Club belongs among the foremost
musical organizations in the Far West,
if not in the country."
The club was recently given an invita
tion to tour Mexico by President Obre
gon, who asks that it be the guest of the
republic and of the University of Mex
ico. It is expected that this invitation
will be accepted in the near future if
satisfactory arrangements can be made.
During the spring vacation, the club
expects to tour the San Joaquin and Sac
ramento valleys.
