# Wrestling Elimination Contest Is Postponed
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney received
word, late Friday afternoon, from
Graduate Manager Lute Nichols of
California, that the Bruins would be
unable to keep their engagement with
the Cardinal grapplers for March 7th,
because five members of the team
were ill with influenza. In view of
this information. Coach Maloney deem
ed it advisable to postpone the elimin
ation bouts, which were scheduled for
Friday, for it will probably be early
next quarter before a new date can
be set.
It was decided, however, to hold up
the boxing and wrestling eliminations
only until next Saturday. Stanford
wrestlers have been ready at all
times to meet their opponents, but
twice this year they have been dis
appointed by failure of outside teams
to keep their engagements. There is
some consolation, however, in the fact
that the matches scheduled with L. A.
A. C. and U. S. C. during Easter vaca
tion will give the men some valuable
experience before they take on the
Bears.
