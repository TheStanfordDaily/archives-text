Editor—Sir: Now that the spring is
on the land, a young man's fancy should
turn to thoughts of baseball, but judging
from the showing made at the Fresh
man game Saturday afternoon this hy
pothesis is anything but true. Now,
Stanford is one of the greatest American
universities, and should turn out for the
greatest American game in overwhelming
majority. Instead of which the Fresh
men toil their way to victory with no
cheering section to lend encouragement.
Varsity baseball should be supported too,
but this is an appeal to the '25 class in
particular to turn out and checr for the
home team—a team which, judging from
all present appearances, is going to go
through a glorious season and wind tip
by handing California a fine large lick
ing. Nor is the audience limited to men
—a few piercing feminine shrieks will

help many a man to beat the throw to'the
plate. This baseball team has probably a
better chance of beating California than
any other Babe team, so bring your Stan
ford spirit: out with you to every game.
W. W., '25.
