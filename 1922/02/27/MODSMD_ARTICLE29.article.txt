# Military Ball to Be All-Campus Affair; Uniform Unessential
## 
### 
A ready disposal of tickets for the
Military Ball, the first formal to be
given in the new Pavilion, has been
reported from the Bookstore. The
military department wishes to rei
terate its invitation to the campus
public to attend next Friday evening,
March 3. The wearing of a uniform is
not as essential as some have sup
posed, but has only been suggested to
R. O. T. C. members and ex-service
men as a dress befitting the occasion.
The dance will last from 9 to 1, with
Whitmer's orchestra providing the
music. Hundreds of flags are to be
used in the decorative scheme and
the floor will be in the best shape for
the enjoyment of the dancers. Mili
tary visitors from the Presidio and
elsewhere will be guests.
