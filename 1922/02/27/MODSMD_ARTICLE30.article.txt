### 
ANGLO FRENCH ENTENTE
Lloyd George and Poincare have at last
come to an understanding regarding the
policies of their governments. Lloyd
George obtained Poincare's assent to the
proposed ten-year land armament holi
day by promising to give France certain
guarantees, nad agreeing nÂ®t to include
the reparations clause of the Versailles
treaty in the agenda of the Genoa confer
ence. Lloyd George also assured Poin
care, that the Russian question would be
reconsidered. The agreement seems to
have been hastened by the anxiev of both
parties to have the United States par
ticipate in the forthcoming Genoa parley.
THE NEW LABOR PARTY
The conservative and liberal wings of
the labor party have arrived at an under
standing. Both have united in waging a
political battle in the next fall elections.
They have adopted the English labor
party as their model. Their program,
which includes a war against injunctions,
a fight against the dry laws, and finally a
campaign for the popular election of su
preme court judges, is indeed very am
bitious. They further intend to pledge
support to only candidates favoring lib
eral policy.
THE FOUR-POWER PACT IN THE
SENATE
The four-power pact is now on the
senate floor. The democrats seem to he
determined on defeating the ratification
of the treaty, and they are supported by
the four irreconcilables, namely Borah,
Johnson, La Follette, and France. The
Brandegee reservation was abandoned in
the commitee by a close vote, and after
consultation with Harding, a compromise
resolution was adopted which states:
that the United States reads the treaty
as containing no commitment to armed
force, no alliance, and no obligation to
go to anybody's defense.
