# “Religion of College Man” Talk to Encina Clubmen
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan was again
the Sunday evening speaker at En
cina Club. Last night, in his speech
on "The Religion of the College Man,"
Dr. Jordan pointed out that too often
emphasis is placed on the outward
manifestations of religion rather than
on the inward.
"Religion," he said, "has in the past
been defiled by creeds, small inter
pretations, intolerance, superstition
and mysticism." Dr. Jordan advised
the men to accept those interpreta
tions which seemed to them to be
feasible and intelligible, and to regard
the unintelligible with the attitude,
"I don't know."
In speaking of prayers, he said that

they should not be looked upon as a
means of bringing about material
changes, but should be considered as
something internal, in which you ask
for the best.
