Diogones would need a battleship
searchlight and a pack of bloodhounds
to lind many Stanford students that do
not belong to at least one organization
on the campus. The latest flash from
the statistics board indicates that in a
total student body of 2,58 X, for the
winter quarter, there are established 102
different organizations. This gives an
average of one organization for every
25 students, and as 25 is approximately
the average membership for campus
groups, it can he seen that nearly every
one is or is about to be initiated into
the mysteries of some society or other
organization.
The chances for being an officer are
batting at slightly less odds. At an
average of three officers for every or
ganization, the Mathematical Boy Won
der can take time off and figure up how
many students hold official positions.
