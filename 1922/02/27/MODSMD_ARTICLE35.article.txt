# WEIGHT COURT TEAM ENTERS SEMI-FINALS OF P.A.A. MARCH 11
## 
### 
Coach "Bud" Young's 130-pound
quintet will* play in the semi-finals of
the P. A. A. lightweight basketball
tournament, March 11. Manager J.
B. Sansone, who announced this fact
yesterday, said that their opponent
had not been selected yet. '
The midgets have only played one
game in the P. A. A. tourney so far.
A week ago Saturday, St. Ignatius
went down before the attack of the
Cardinals. This victory throws all
the dope in favor of Stanford's com
ing-out champions, for the Saints were
doped to win the title for this season,
having the 1921 gonfalon already to
their 'credit.
If the local five wins their second
game, they will be matched against
the winner of the Olympic-Ignatian
contest, on March 25, to fight for the
gold medal. Practice began today.
Since the last California game, the
team has been resting although still
keeping training.
The last two games, which won for
the 130's the second consecutive series
from the Blue and Gold, marked the
close of an undefeated season for
Coach Young's proteges. The form
shown by the midgets in the last few
games of their regular season indicated
that they have just about hit their
stride. The team-work and fire they
have exhibited points them out as the
most likely aggregation for the P. A.
A. championship.
