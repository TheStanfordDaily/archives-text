# BABE SWIMMERS TAKE MEET FROM ALAMEDA
## 
### 
The Cardinal freshmen found little
difficulty in running up 55 points while
the Alameda High team could only
gather 12 points in the dual swimming
contest held in Encina pool Saturday
morning. Coach Brandsten did not use
the entire personnel of the babes' team
in humbling the East Bay paddlers.
Cundall was the only Alameda swimmer
able to capture a first place. He de
feated Wolf in the 100-yard breast stroke
event. There were only two men en
tered in this race. The other points
gathered by the Alameda boys resulted
from four third places and a second place
in the diving.
The babe mermen were minus the serv
ices of Captain Klebahn and Meyers, the
sprint stars of the squad. Several other
men who can usually he counted upon to
make points were not able to compete.
The Cardinal paddlers made a clean
sweep of all places in the 220-yard free
style. Belcher ripped through the water
in the fast time of 2:05:3, and was closely
followed by his teammate, Draper. This
is the first time Draper has been in com
petition for several weeks. Chittendon
and Rosenbaum performed in their usual
manner, seizing lirst and second places
respectively.
Belcher was high point man for the
freshmen, taking first place in the 220-
yard and 100-yard events, besides swim
ming a lap in the relay. Watson was not
hard pressed in the 50-yard back stroke
race.
