# PALO ALTO PLAYERS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THREE-ACT COMEDY
## 
### 
broni the first appealing notes of the
song which opened the pl;*T, until the
curtain fell on the linal scene between
the lovers, the audience witnessed a thor
oughly enjoyable three-act comedy in
" 1 he Gypsy Trail," produced by the Palo
Alto Community Players in the Assem
bly Hall, Friday evening.
The plot, although not brimming with
unexpected and startling scenes, was
nevertheless versatile in comic situations
and contained many clever, laughter-pro
voking lines. Ihe play was dependent
on its actors, rather than on situations
and strategy, for its interest, which some
what took it out of the realm of the
modern, "sparkling lines,", wishy-washy
comedy. "The Gypsy Trail" was particu
larly adaptable for a community produc
tion. as it offered such a wide variety of
charatcer parts.
In the part of Michael Rudder, James
Ray was undoubtedly the star of the
production, with his emotional, buoyant
characterization of a carefree, adventur
ous youth. He did not at times quite
reach the expectation of the audience,
but on the whole his acting in this uij
usual role was excellent.
Charmingly romantic was Constance
Tamplin, '23, as Frances Raymond in the
leading feminine role, and a fascinating
puzzle to her audience as she entered
naturally into her various moods. She
laughed and rebelled at the hopelessly,
scrupulously, "perfect young gentleman,"
Edward Andrews, her lover, who even
asked for her father's consent to kidnap
her. Miss Tamplin has a very pleasing
voice, and she carried an almost pro
fessional poise throughout her difficult
part of being "just natural."
Mrs. A. E. Peek, as Ned's grand
mother. was as capticating as the heroine
and almost as vivacious. Her acting was
marred only by difficulty in hearing her.
Kidnaping a young lady whose affec
tion he is trying to win isn't the easiest
thing in the world to accomplish, but
Fred Hughes, '23, as Ned Andrews, the
prosaic but devoted lover, did it with pro
fessional ease. His playing throughout
was clone with thorough consistency.
Frank Moore did some good acting as
Mr. Frank Raymond, father of the
heroine. As his small son, Browning
Railey won several laughs from the au
dience by his life and naturalness.
Mrs. C. E. Clendennin in the part of
Janet Raymond, Morris M. Wild as the
butler, and Mrs. D. L. Webster as the
maid, were all well suited to their parts.

fessional poise throughout her difficult
part of being "just natural."
Mrs. A. E. Peek, as Ned's grand
mother. was as capticating as the heroine
and almost as vivacious. Her acting was
marred only by difficulty in hearing her.
Kidnaping a young lady whose affec
tion he is trying to win isn't the easiest
thing in the world to accomplish, but
Fred Hughes, '23, as Ned Andrews, the
prosaic but devoted lover, did it with pro
fessional ease. His playing throughout
was clone with thorough consistency.
Frank Moore did some good acting as
Mr. Frank Raymond, father of the
heroine. As his small son, Browning
Railey won several laughs from the au
dience by his life and naturalness.
Mrs. C. E. Clendennin in the part of
Janet Raymond, Morris M. Wild as the
butler, and Mrs. D. L. Webster as the
maid, were all well suited to their parts.
broni the first appealing notes of the
song which opened the pl;*T, until the
curtain fell on the linal scene between
the lovers, the audience witnessed a thor
oughly enjoyable three-act comedy in
" 1 he Gypsy Trail," produced by the Palo
Alto Community Players in the Assem
bly Hall, Friday evening.
The plot, although not brimming with
unexpected and startling scenes, was
nevertheless versatile in comic situations
and contained many clever, laughter-pro
voking lines. Ihe play was dependent
on its actors, rather than on situations
and strategy, for its interest, which some
what took it out of the realm of the
modern, "sparkling lines,", wishy-washy
comedy. "The Gypsy Trail" was particu
larly adaptable for a community produc
tion. as it offered such a wide variety of
charatcer parts.
In the part of Michael Rudder, James
Ray was undoubtedly the star of the
production, with his emotional, buoyant
characterization of a carefree, adventur
ous youth. He did not at times quite
reach the expectation of the audience,
but on the whole his acting in this uij
usual role was excellent.
Charmingly romantic was Constance
Tamplin, '23, as Frances Raymond in the
leading feminine role, and a fascinating
puzzle to her audience as she entered
naturally into her various moods. She
laughed and rebelled at the hopelessly,
scrupulously, "perfect young gentleman,"
Edward Andrews, her lover, who even
asked for her father's consent to kidnap
her. Miss Tamplin has a very pleasing
voice, and she carried an almost pro
fessional poise throughout her difficult
part of being "just natural."
