# OLYMPIC NINE DEFEATS CARDS BY 3 TO 0 SCORE
## Ludolph, Olympic Heaver, Chalks up a No-hit, No-run Record; Sixth Frame Fatal 
### Charles Prior, ’23 
The Olympic Club ball players took
home the laurels from the game with
Coach Seay's Cards on the local lut Sat-
r urday afternoon, chalking up three tallies
in the sixth inning of an otherwise air
tight contest.
Ludolph, Winged-O slahster, pitched a
wonder game and held the varsity to a
no-hit, no-run contest. Seay's best stick
stcrs simply could not connect with the
pellet and the lanky Olympian bagged
seven strikeouts. Jim Clark did good
work for the varsity and, with the ex
ception of the fatal sixth when the visit
ors drove out two hits and ran in three
markers, he had things completely in
hand. The records show five hits against
him and four strikeouts to his credit.
"Lefty" Heckendorf; Coach Seay's
doughty little third sacker, swung on the
horsehide in the fifth for a triple to deep
center, but \ ellou called him out for
failing to touch first base." "Lefty" says
he touched the base, and if he doesn't
know, who does ?
Clark started out in whirlwind style
and garnered in two strikeouts in the
first frame. In the Card half of the in
ning, Woodward struck out, Peavy hit
to the center fielder, and Patterson
bingled to the second baseman.
In the second, Kelly hit a single to
right but was caught on his steal to sec
ond. Morton hit to Peavy* and the visit
ors ha dwasted another inning. The Cards
could not fathom Ludolph's offerings and
the frame was over.
The third and fourth were airtight,
will no outbursts from either side. In
the fifth "Lefty" took his healthy swing
which looked like a score until Vellou
called it a put out.
And then came the sixth. Coleman
took first on Woodward's error and went
to second 011 Ratner's wild throw. Lu-
I dolph hit to Peavy and was safe on iirst
on fielder's choice, Peavy catching Cole
man at home. Maloney hit to left for a
double, scoring Ludolph, and went to
third on Clark s balk. Clark hit Corlian
with a pitched ball and he trotted to first.
Garrigan flew out to Wayland. Then
came Burns, the stalwart first sacker of
the visitors, and he drove a low, grass
cutting hit to left which scored Maloney
and Corlian. Kelly hit to Peavy and the
inning was over, but the damage had been
done.
The last three innings were nip and
tuck, with only one hit and that by Cor
lian in the eighth. Ratner, varsity clean
up man and one of the best hitters on the
club, fanned the atmosphere in vain and
took the count three times in as many
times at bat. "Doc" Wayland, the
"grand old man" of the Card outer gar
dens. who distinguished himself in the
M. J. B. Coffee Kid game by annexing
three hits, failed to maintain his average,
although he connected with the sphere
twice.
Peavy and Patterson hit the ball every
time up but not into safe territory. Carver
drove one to deep centcr in the fifth
which looked like it was good until Mor
ton pulled it down. Mitchell batted for
Clark in the ninth but it was a foul and
the catcher caught it. The box score
