# IRELAND'S TEAM TO CROSS BATS WITH CARDINALS
## "Cliff's" Independents Will Invade Campus Tomorrow in Effort to Win Ballgame 
### 
Cliff Ireland and his aggregation of
league stars invade the campus tomorrow
afternoon to play the varsity nine in the
second game of the three-game series
scheduled between the two teams. The
Independents arc out to make it two
straight, with a chance of cleaning up in
the series.
Seay will probably send against Ire
land the same line-up that lie used in the
last contest, with the exception of the
pitcher. Draper, Clark, and Loewenstein
have been worked most often of late, but
there are a number of other hurlers eager
for a chance to hurl against "Cliff" and
his gang. So far Seay has used more
than one pitcher in every game except the
one against the Olympic Club last Satur
day, when Jim Clark worked the whole
nine innings.
The Cards were up against the real
thing in the shape of the lanky slabster,
Ludolph, in the Wing-0 contest. Al
though it was hard on their batting aver
ages, it gave them the kind of practice
which will put them in trim to walk on
the Blue and Gold nine.
If "Cliff" can offer them the same
caliber of opposition, so much the better
for the final resuls of the season, and
judging from his last visit, it is probable
that he will do it. The Independents
have one great advantage. "Cliff" can
literally talk the average ball club right
out of a victory, and he has accomplished
this several times with the varsity.
Tomorrow's game will start at 3:00
o'clock and the admission will be student
body cards for students and 25 cents for
the public.
