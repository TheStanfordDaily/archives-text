# LANDELS CHOSEN FOR DEBATE WITH OREGON
## 
### 
Leland Stanford, '24, and Bertram!
Comparet, '24. left the campus yesterday
for Seattle, where they will meet the
University of Washington team in the
Tri State debate there Thursday eve
ning. Due to a sudden attack of in
fluenza, Emmet McCaffery, '24. was un
able to make the trip.
Edward Landels, '21. a veteran of
many successful forensic contests, will
present the second affirmative speech in
the Assembly Hall Friday evening, in
which he will deal with the economic
phase of the sales tax.
Harold Fendler, '22, the other member
of Stanford's affirmative team, has de
bated with Landels for two years in
intersociety debates. During this time
these men have not lost one debate. They
were the two members of the Euphronia
Debating Society team which won from
the Nestoria team on this same question
several weeks ago.
"I believe there is at least a fifty
fifty chance of a sales tax passing
Congress," said Coach Emerson yes
terday in discussing the subject of
the Tri-State debate, on Friday. Ac
cording to Mr. Emerson, President
Harding has repeatedly insisted that
he would veto any soldiers' bonus bill
that did not provide for a sales tax,
since the President holds that if any
bonus bill is to become law, the sales
tax is the most feasible method of
raising the money.
