# INTERPRETATION OF "HAMLET" PRESENTED
## Miss Dorothea Spinney Gives Dramatic Characterization of Tragedy Last Evening 
### Winifred Johnston, '22 
"'â– or he is likely, had he
Been put on, to prove most royal."
In these lines of Shakespeare, Miss
Dorothea Spinney in prefacing her re
cital of Hamlet, gave the immortal au
thor s ideal of his famous character, in
the Assembly Hall, last evening.
Throughout the play from which Miss
Spinney gave nine widely varied scenes,
she held the audience spellbound by her
marvelous character delineation, her
very expressive gestures, and perhaps
most significant of all, by her voice.
Critics have praised this feature of her
personality to the utmost, but certainly
too much can not be said of her power
of inflection and voice modulation, which
carried with it an impressiveness that
marked almost every word. One can
readily believe the statement that her
voice is considered second only to the
best in England, as her careful training
of it evidences, and this is undoubtedly
one of the chief reasons for her inter
national fame as one of the greatest of
dramatic readers.
Miss Spinney remarked in a brief in
troduction that, although she had never
seen "Hamlet" played during her child
hood, she had been told the story, and
that the conception of the play which she
gave last night was her very own.
Miss Spinney wore a simple black
velvet costume, which represented her
chief character, Hamlet; but she threw
herself so vitally into every part that one
could almost visualize the tragic grief
crazed figure of Ophelia, or the base.
