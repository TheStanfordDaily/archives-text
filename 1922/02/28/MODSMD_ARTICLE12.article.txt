# INTERPRETATION OF "HAMLET" PRESENTED
## Miss Dorothea Spinney Gives Dramatic Characterization of Tragedy Last Evening 
### Winifred Johnston, '22 
"'■or he is likely, had he
Been put on, to prove most royal."
In these lines of Shakespeare, Miss
Dorothea Spinney in prefacing her re
cital of Hamlet, gave the immortal au
thor s ideal of his famous character, in
the Assembly Hall, last evening.
Throughout the play from which Miss
Spinney gave nine widely varied scenes,
she held the audience spellbound by her
marvelous character delineation, her
very expressive gestures, and perhaps
most significant of all, by her voice.
Critics have praised this feature of her
personality to the utmost, but certainly
too much can not be said of her power
of inflection and voice modulation, which
carried with it an impressiveness that
marked almost every word. One can
readily believe the statement that her
voice is considered second only to the
best in England, as her careful training
of it evidences, and this is undoubtedly
one of the chief reasons for her inter
national fame as one of the greatest of
dramatic readers.
Miss Spinney remarked in a brief in
troduction that, although she had never
seen "Hamlet" played during her child
hood, she had been told the story, and
that the conception of the play which she
gave last night was her very own.
Miss Spinney wore a simple black
velvet costume, which represented her
chief character, Hamlet; but she threw
herself so vitally into every part that one
could almost visualize the tragic grief
crazed figure of Ophelia, or the base.
treacherous character of the king.
Perhaps her most gripping scenes in
regard to dramatic effect were the ones
in which the ghost of Hamlet's father
appears before him, and tells him of his
treacherous murder by his brother
Claudius; again in the garden where
Ophelia sings mad chants over her
father s grave, and at the close, where the
deaths of the king, queen, Laertes, and
Hamlet occur. Miss Spinney brought
out with vividness the different moods
of Hamlet, as sometimes he is brooding,
melancholy, sometimes angry, or again
feigning madness in order to deceive his
uncle, tlie murderer. Her wonderful in
terpretation of the famous soliloquy, "To
be, or not to be," gave the words new
meaning.
In striking contrast to the remainder
of the tragedy was the humorous scene
of the grave-diggers, in which the char
acters were rendered very lifelike by
naturalness of gesture and excellence of
facial expression.
Miss Spinney will make her next ap
pearance in "Hamlet," at the Belasco
Theater in New York, on March 28. be
fore the annual meeting of the New York
Drama League. Last year, she gave a
recital of this play to an audience of
15,000 in the Belasco Theater. After
completing her engagement in New York,
she will sail for England.

treacherous murder by his brother
Claudius; again in the garden where
Ophelia sings mad chants over her
father s grave, and at the close, where the
deaths of the king, queen, Laertes, and
Hamlet occur. Miss Spinney brought
out with vividness the different moods
of Hamlet, as sometimes he is brooding,
melancholy, sometimes angry, or again
feigning madness in order to deceive his
uncle, tlie murderer. Her wonderful in
terpretation of the famous soliloquy, "To
be, or not to be," gave the words new
meaning.
In striking contrast to the remainder
of the tragedy was the humorous scene
of the grave-diggers, in which the char
acters were rendered very lifelike by
naturalness of gesture and excellence of
facial expression.
Miss Spinney will make her next ap
pearance in "Hamlet," at the Belasco
Theater in New York, on March 28. be
fore the annual meeting of the New York
Drama League. Last year, she gave a
recital of this play to an audience of
15,000 in the Belasco Theater. After
completing her engagement in New York,
she will sail for England.
"'■or he is likely, had he
Been put on, to prove most royal."
In these lines of Shakespeare, Miss
Dorothea Spinney in prefacing her re
cital of Hamlet, gave the immortal au
thor s ideal of his famous character, in
the Assembly Hall, last evening.
Throughout the play from which Miss
Spinney gave nine widely varied scenes,
she held the audience spellbound by her
marvelous character delineation, her
very expressive gestures, and perhaps
most significant of all, by her voice.
Critics have praised this feature of her
personality to the utmost, but certainly
too much can not be said of her power
of inflection and voice modulation, which
carried with it an impressiveness that
marked almost every word. One can
readily believe the statement that her
voice is considered second only to the
best in England, as her careful training
of it evidences, and this is undoubtedly
one of the chief reasons for her inter
national fame as one of the greatest of
dramatic readers.
Miss Spinney remarked in a brief in
troduction that, although she had never
seen "Hamlet" played during her child
hood, she had been told the story, and
that the conception of the play which she
gave last night was her very own.
Miss Spinney wore a simple black
velvet costume, which represented her
chief character, Hamlet; but she threw
herself so vitally into every part that one
could almost visualize the tragic grief
crazed figure of Ophelia, or the base.
treacherous character of the king.
Perhaps her most gripping scenes in
regard to dramatic effect were the ones
in which the ghost of Hamlet's father
appears before him, and tells him of his
treacherous murder by his brother
Claudius; again in the garden where
