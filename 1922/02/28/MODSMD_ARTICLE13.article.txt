# BABE STICK ARTISTS TO CLASH WITH SAN MATEO TOMORROW
## 
### 
Coach Hoyd Kallam's collection of j
lirst-year diamond men will take the local |
field against San Mateo High School to- {
morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock. The dope
favors another victory for the Babe nine.
The freshmen have been hitting the
hall pretty well, hut their fielding in the
last game was poor, with five errors by
the infieldcrs. Ihe men performing in
the inner gardens usually gather in the
pellet like real ball players, and practice
wil remedy any tendency toward ragged
work. Jim Lawson is now out for the
position behind the bat. but he will have
to show exceptional ability to displace
Johnston. Mulchey at short and Roberts
at the second bag appear to have their!
berths cinched. McDonald will probably !
hold down the initial sack and Cudde-1
back will be at third in tomorrow's fray, j
Kallam has found a new man for the;
outfield in Connor, who played center
Saturday. Dick Lawson. left fielder,
heads the freshman batting list. Mc-
Candless has been playing in right, and
Saturday he announced his presence in
tlie game with a triple that came close to
being a home run.
The Babes' weakest department is the
pitching staff. All the slabsters need
very much the practice which the present
schedule of prep school opposition is pro
viding. Either Soloman. Teague, or
Howard will hurl against San Mateo.
