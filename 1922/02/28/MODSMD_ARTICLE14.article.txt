# Choice of Strawberry Canyon As U.C. Stadium Site is Being Fought
## 
### 
University of California professors
| and alumni are fighting vigorously
| against the choice of Strawberry Canyon
jas the site of the stadium. The row has
| culminated in the resignation of Pro-
J fessor Charles H. Reiher, head of the
| logic department, who has stated in his
| resignation that he could not countenance
i the desecration of the canyon, long a i
spot of incomparable beauty, for the
erection of a structure which could as
well be erected elsewhere at no such
sacrifice.
Similar protests arc being received by
Governor Stephens, and California
alumni throughout the state are being
asked to lend their aid in fighting this
measure. The California board of re
gents meets today to take action on the
| university budget, and is expected to
| take some action on the resignation of
Professor Reiber and its attendant com
plications.
