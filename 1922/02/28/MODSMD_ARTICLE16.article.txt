## 
### 
l'inal preparations for tlie Euphronia-
St. Mary's debate next Saturday will be
made at the session of Euphronia Society
Thursday evening in room 12 of the Law
Building. The affirmative arguments to
: be used in the contest with St. Mary's
A. P. G. U. Society will be gone through
completely by the three Euphronia speak
ers, M. O. Tobriner, '24, B. W. Levit, '24,
j and P. V. Spencer, '25. Speeches are to
last ten minutes, with four-minute re
buttals, as in the debate, and members of
the society will be given a chance to
make criticisms which will improve the
I arguments and delivery for the real con
gest in the Little Theater. This will be
the semi-final in the College Debating
Societies League.
The subject chosen is "Resolved, that
the United States forces should Evacuate
Haiti." The Haitian question has been
brought up in Congress, and a special
; Congressional committee lias been sent
j to the island to investigate conditions.
I lhe liveness of this question, and the
amount of discussion which it is causing
throughout the country is expected to
furnish both sides with a great deal of
argument lor debate.
All judges are to be chosen from otit
j side the University. Euphronia has sent
| a, list of ten people in Palo Alto to the
j A. P. G. U. Society, from which they are
I to pick three.
Little is known of the St. Mary's team,
as they have not debated here for several
years. However, the A. P. G. U. squad
recently won a victory over Congress So
cety of California. Opposed to them,
the three Euphronia men have demon
strated considerable ability, both in try
outs and previous debates. Spencer, who
has not debated at Stanford before, has
as his strong point argument from ex
position. with a clear and convincing re
j lation of conditions. Levit was a mem
j bcr of the freshman team which debated
j California, and is alternate on the tri
j state squad. Tobriner was in the fresh
j man-sophomore debate last year, was
I also on the freshman team in the contest
! against California, and was a member of
' the varsity squad last fall.
