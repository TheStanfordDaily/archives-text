# RUSSIAN MUSIC RECITAL WILL BE GIVEN TONIGHT
## Dr. Henry Lanz Will P resent Program of Modern Slavic Numbers in Little Theatre 
### 
A lecture-recital on Russian music
is the subject of the program which
Dr. Henry Lanz of the Slavic Depart
ment will give this evening at 7:30,
in the Little Theater. He will speak
on the music of the Russian school of
composers ami will illustrate his points
by exemplary selections.
l)r. Lanz believes that the success
of modern Russian music is due to its
unusual development. He will sketch
a brief history of the music of his
country before he begins the program
itself. Previous to the nineteenth
century, there was almost no cultiva
tion of musical talent among the Rus
sian peoples on account of their so
cial economic state. Consequently,
there existed only the folk songs of
the peasants and the church melodies
from which the modern type of Rus
sian music has grown.
The music of the nineteenth and the
twentieth centuries will then be dis
cussed by Dr. Lanz. His program in
cludes numbers by the composers
whom he considers as most outstand
ing and typical of their class. He has
chosen from their works, selections
which he believes to be the most rep
resentative of the man and those
which the American public will ap
preciate the most.
The fpllowing is the program which
Dr. Lanz will play:
Folk Melodies
Church Music
Kramennio Ostrov (Rocky Isle)
Rubinstein
Troika Tchaikowsky
At the Convent Borodin
Song of India Rimsky-Korsakov
Prelude No. 8 Skrjabin
Prelude in C sharp minor

Dr. Lanz has given this lecture-re
cital before the Sorosis Club of San
Francisco and the Fortnight Club of
Palo Alto. He is well known to Stan
ford music lovers and is a member
of the Stanford Music Club.
