## 
### 
kugby football will again hold sway
when the Cardinal rugby fifteen battle
for honors with the Blue and Gold team
next Saturday afternoon in the stadium.
Captain Dave Wallace received a chal
lenge from George Davis, ex-'2O, who is
now attending California and is coaching
the Blue and Gold fifteen.
The Cardinal chances are very good
for a victory over the California squad
if the material on hand means anything.
For the last few weeks there have been
forty and fifty men out for practice every
day on the California football field.
With weather permitting, the Cardinal
squad will get into action every after
noon tinder the direction of Coach Harry
Maloney and Captain Dave Wallace. The
team played well against the H. M. S.
Raleigh team several weeks ago, and
with additional practice should offer the
spectators a good brand of football.
Coach Maloney is anxious to have any
one who has played rugby football to re
port immediately for practice, as the team
that,, will play against California will be
chosen from those making the best show
ing in practice.
