# SEAY GIVING FINAL TOUCHES TO BABE BASKETBALL TEAM
## 
### 
Final touches and as much polish
as possible are being added to the
freshman court squad by Coach Seay
this week, in preparation for the final
game of the season, Friday night, in
the Oakland Auditorium.
Scrimmages the earlier part of the
week, mixed with signal practice and
a great deal of basket-shooting, will
form the basis of the work for the
game. Every member of the squad is
in tip-top shape ,with the exception
of Shopke, who has had a slump dur
ing the last few days.
Hoffman and Hooper are both in
perfect form again, after their recent
incapacities. All the stiffness has
worked out of Hoffman's knee, and
Hooper has recovered from his cold.
