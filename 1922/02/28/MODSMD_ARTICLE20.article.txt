# Encina Pool Water To Be Used Fighting Fire
## 
### 
Using the water of Encina pool to fight
fire if it becomes necessary, is being pro
vided for by the installation of a new
water main at the gymnasium. The pipes
are being so arranged that in case of fire
the water in the pool will be immediately
available for use.
This will be especially effective in
guarding against lire in the military bar
racks close to the gymnasium, as it will
put an adequate supply of water close to
the danger spot in case of conflagration,
without having to lower the pressure at
other spots on the campus to such a great
extent.
Work is also being done in the in
stallation of a new fire hydrant line run
ning back of the Press Building up
toward the Kingscote.
