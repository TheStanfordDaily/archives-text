"Divided we fall." Henry was right. The Cali
fornia concrete arena has proved a beautiful fantasy,
a lovely background for a Maxfielcl Parrish, but as
Rube Goldberg might say, "It doesn't mean any
thing." Six months of construction upon an ethereal
foundation of Ponzied procedure and the Regents of
the University of California are where they started,
and the road has gotten much worse in the meantime
due to the heavy hauling that has been done during
the preparations.
When the original site was picked everyone looked
with keen anticipation toward the erection of the
marvelous coliseum which was scheduled to arise in
a burst of public spirit. Then the minor matter of
property condemnation entered, and after assuring
all hands that everything was fine, the site was
■changed all of a sudden to Strawberry Canyon, a
neat shift in scenery to be sure.
After the dust of changing location had settled, a
member of the locating committee protested that the
Strawberry Canyon place was not the right one for
the stadium, being too close to civilization and the
Greek Theater. This makes a pretty mess for the
Regents to overcome before any real work can begin
on the stadium, bowl, coliseum, or new athletic
grounds, whichever it may be called.
We feel sorry for California and wish them well in
a speedy solution of their difficulties. In the mean
time the little Stanford excavation and elevation type
bowl waxes very beautiful as the grass is thickening
with spring, and the appearance of permanency is no
idle dream, as old Jup Pluvius has seen in his vain
endeavor to wash some of the erathwork away dur
ing the past winter.
