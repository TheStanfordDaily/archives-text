The following is from the editorial page of the
O. A. C. Barometer.
NO PLACE FOR THIEVES
In spite of repeated warnings concerning petty thievery
on the campus, offenses are still being committed.
Offenders have been dealt with severely by the student
council. In this matter the council should have the support
of the entire student body in developing a public opinion that
will ostracise any student convicted. The dignity of a college
such as O. A. C. demands that such pettiness should be en
tirely eliminated.
The same condition exists here on the Stanford
Campus to a great extent, although commonly it is
not brought to our knowledge because most students
are prone to look upon small borrowings that are
never returned as a joke rather than as a misde
meanor.
Complaints come in constantly of bicycles being
taken and then found down in Palo Alto leaning
against a curb. The person who took the bicycle
to town undoubtedly only "borrowed" it for the pur
pose of riding down town, but he is just as much a
thief in the eyes of the one who had to go without the .
wheel for a day or so as if the motive had been to
keep the bicycle for good.
In any other community the man who persistently
uses other people's property for his own advantage
without consent is fined or locked up so that he will
change his manners in the future. Here there is too
much condonement of questionable acts as being col
legiate. A few hard hits at those who are making
sport with others' belongings and the abuses will he
stopped and everyone greatly benefitted.
