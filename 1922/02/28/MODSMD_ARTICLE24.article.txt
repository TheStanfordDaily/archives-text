Pippa Passes —deal her a new hand.

The staff statistician has been busy again. The flam
ing furies of fire are his subject. No, not bottled death
or amateur chile, but regular, roaring, red, rampant
destruction. Question number one is, "What is correct
in calling the fire department?"
* * *
In the Hocka Hocka Hamma house, two suggested
telephoning the S. A. E. house and asking a freshman
to run over to the new Union where the Dekes might
be questioned as to how their insurance company was
saved money.
. One inmate thought of screaming for help while
putting a dressing robe on the trunk and throwing the
room-mate out the window.
Twenty per cent of the feminine element thought
that it might be a good idea to quit cleaning gloves
with the Pyrene, though the rest didn't. Didn't think.
* • *
Cabbages here offers one neck-piece of genuine Anga
loosian eel's fur, to the first female who answers this
question correctly: "What is correct in calling the
Fire Department?" Only grammatical calls will bs
considered. Absolutely no profanity.
* * *
For the men. Nothing could be more suitable to the
well-dressed man than a form-fitting, California Cabbage
Indestructo cigar, like that one which has been gener
ously donated by the Fire Chief to be awarded to the
first man to guess the answer to the riddle given above.
It will be considered unfair to collaborate. The only
clue to be given is "Telephone Book." No more than
three guesses of the same thing will be considered from
one person.

Take—You're Base
See College Dick in "Jazz Suit" slick
And pomade in his hair.
His snappy tie beguiles the eye—
Look! Something debonnaire.
Each loving brother cuts the other
While after co-eds fair.
His nails, Dick files, and calmly smiles—
(Please join him in the air.)
'The Roble queens don't like my line,
The sisters say I'm dumb.
But after all, I don't complain,
At Harlter's I'm no bum!'

Gliclup Concert
According to a statement issued today by Worn 'n
Dangling, the Gliclup is pretty good; since the director
has been directing. "Every guy should ought to have
went," he said. The press said "Rise, Sleep no More,"
was just like that which can be able to be listened
on five days per weekly when Baby Benjamin aids in
assisting Stanford's scholarly students to eat before
there ate o'clocks.
Any poster will tell which organist direct the Gliclup.
Also any press. Look!
* * *
"We do not hesitate to say that the Gliclup belongs
among the foremost organizations, that is, if there is
any room left there, in the country if not the universe."
—Riveters Review.
"The Gliclup shattered every box-office record at the
Blue and Gold theatre today. Ninety per cent of the
screws were shaken loose from the seats, besides; and
many windows were destroyed, both by high notes and
when the exits became jammed. When they sang
"Nature's Adoration," by Beethoven, the audience voci
ferously agreed, thinking, no doubt, that Nature would
respond with some relief. All was in vain, however, and
the crowd was completely conquered."—Police Report.
"The College songsters showed results of splendid
direction and tuition. They could not have screamed
louder had the tuition been $1,000,000." —Iron Trade
Monthly.
"Accuracy of pitch, and sureness of attack completely
routed the crowd. The heavy missies could not be
dodged and the attack was therefore a complete suc
cess. Frequent outbursts of genuine approval were
elicited fi'om the spectators, especially when they knew
the villain personally."—The Day Times.
"There existed a certain spirit which added zest to
every number. It is surprising what a presentable drink
can be made by mixing certain spirits with zest."—
Bartenders' Guide (1922 Edition).
There you have it, fellers. Don't let the filthy lucre
stand in the way. One dirty dollar does it. Come one.
come all.
Those with only one dollar had better spend it for
earmuffs and sneak in the exit.

To Help the Business Staff
He had just bought a hunch of California Neverlights.
They were supposed to be matches, and had cost him
several seal skins. Feverishly, he broke off one after
another in an effort to light a fire, so baby's usual pound
of blubber could be melted into porridge. Bah! He
gave up. (Profanity.)
Putting the rest in his pocket he pulled up a chunk
of ice from the corner of the igloo in order to rest
while he whets up for that trader. He fiercely seats
himself. Vengeance and —WOW!
"Lucky Strike!"

Gliclup Concert
According to a statement issued today by Worn 'n
Dangling, the Gliclup is pretty good; since the director
has been directing. "Every guy should ought to have
went," he said. The press said "Rise, Sleep no More,"
was just like that which can be able to be listened
on five days per weekly when Baby Benjamin aids in
assisting Stanford's scholarly students to eat before
there ate o'clocks.
Any poster will tell which organist direct the Gliclup.
Also any press. Look!

"We do not hesitate to say that the Gliclup belongs
among the foremost organizations, that is, if there is
any room left there, in the country if not the universe."
—Riveters Review.
"The Gliclup shattered every box-office record at the
Blue and Gold theatre today. Ninety per cent of the
screws were shaken loose from the seats, besides; and
many windows were destroyed, both by high notes and
when the exits became jammed. When they sang
"Nature's Adoration," by Beethoven, the audience voci
ferously agreed, thinking, no doubt, that Nature would
respond with some relief. All was in vain, however, and
the crowd was completely conquered."—Police Report.
"The College songsters showed results of splendid
direction and tuition. They could not have screamed
louder had the tuition been $1,000,000." —Iron Trade
Monthly.
"Accuracy of pitch, and sureness of attack completely
routed the crowd. The heavy missies could not be
dodged and the attack was therefore a complete suc
cess. Frequent outbursts of genuine approval were
elicited fi'om the spectators, especially when they knew
the villain personally."—The Day Times.
"There existed a certain spirit which added zest to
every number. It is surprising what a presentable drink
can be made by mixing certain spirits with zest."—
Bartenders' Guide (1922 Edition).
There you have it, fellers. Don't let the filthy lucre
stand in the way. One dirty dollar does it. Come one.

Those with only one dollar had better spend it for
earmuffs and sneak in the exit.

To Help the Business Staff
He had just bought a hunch of California Neverlights.
They were supposed to be matches, and had cost him
several seal skins. Feverishly, he broke off one after
another in an effort to light a fire, so baby's usual pound
of blubber could be melted into porridge. Bah! He
gave up. (Profanity.)
Putting the rest in his pocket he pulled up a chunk
of ice from the corner of the igloo in order to rest
while he whets up for that trader. He fiercely seats
himself. Vengeance and —WOW!
"Lucky Strike!"
