THE U. S. MERCHANT MARINE

1 lie Supreme Court yesterday upheld
tlie merchant marine law which provides
that all shipping between the United
States and it.- possessions should be car
ried in American ships.
President Harding has also recom
mended to Congress a subsidy for United
States shipowners. It is maintained that
at present the American Shipping Board
owns more merchant vessels than any
other shipping house in the world. But
the Shipping Board operates at a loss,
and if it tr-ied to sell out at this time the
ships would have to go for about one
fourth what they cost. President Hard
ing s idea i- to hold out the subsidy as
bait to American citizens to buy these
ships, thus America's merchant marine
would be maintained as the complement
of the American navy, and by thus stimu
lating the demand the Shipping Board
would not be forced to sell at such low
prices.
Objections that are always raised
against any government subsidy are being
murmured. Ihe chief argument against
it seems to lie that government 'aid al
ways brings lethargy. The farm bloc in
Congress, according to Senator Capper
of Kansas, is distinctly hostile. The
friends of the soldiers' bonus bill who
have been woefully disappointed recently,
sum up their attitude rather sarcastically
in the phrase. "Millions for shipowners,
but not one cent for the soldiers."
THE ROYAL WEDDING
The marriage of Princess Mary to
A iscount Lascelles today in Westminster
Abbey is the basis of almost unlimited
press comment. Instead of seeking out a
royal, and therefore a foreign husband
for the princess, she is being allowed to
marry a commoner. In this the English
press universally finds reason to rejoice.
Moreover, the viscount is a British sub
ject. and public opinion, favors the union
for that reason.
THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL
ASSOCIATION
The National Educational Association
meeting in Chicago is demanding a Sec
retary of Education in the President's
cabinet along with the passage of the
Towner-Sterling hill which provides fed
eral aid for schools. The hope is that
with federal aid better rural schools
could be established and the district sys
tem abolished.
