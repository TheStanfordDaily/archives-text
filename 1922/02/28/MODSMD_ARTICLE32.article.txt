### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eugene,
Ore., Feb. 28. (P.I.N.S.) â€”From present
indications Oregon is doomed for v
disastrous season in track this spring.
In the first tryouts only about fifty
men, including both freshmen and
varsity, turned out and the majority
of these were green and inexperienced.
Bill Hayward, veteran coach, is very
pessimistic over the outlook and the
apparent lack of interest shown so far.
and says that unless more material
is available for the early preparation
the student body may expect a losing
team. At present Walkley, star miler,
is troubled with a bad toe which may
prevent him from competing at all this
year, while Art Tuck, who was a con
sistent winner in the javelin throw and
weight events last year has left the
university. Art Grilley, freshman
sprinter of last year has also with
drawn from school, thus leaving a
hard gap to fill.
