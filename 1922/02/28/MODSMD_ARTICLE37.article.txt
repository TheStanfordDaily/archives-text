## 
### 
A collection of incunabula, specimens
of printing and block engraving which
appeared before or soon after 1500 A. D.,
is being displayed at the Library this
week. Some of the books on display
were purchased by the Library from the
estate of Dr. Ewald Flugel, professor of
English philology at Stanford until his
death in 1914.
A work by Seneca, printed before 1500,
is one of the volumes whidi the collection
contains. 1 here are four volumes of the
famous Bibliotheca Mundi which was
published in 1260 by De Beauvais, a
French Dominican monk. This is an en
cyclopedia of the Middle Ages, saitt to be
the greatest compendium of knowledge
of the middle thirteenth century.. Among
other books in the collection are a vol
ume (1489) by Marsilo Ficeno, a Floren
tine philosopher, and a 1487 edition of a
work by Sextus Aurelius, an
Italian scholar.
There are on display several original
manuscripts of the Middle Ages. Pro
fessor H. I\. Fairclough has loaned this
exhibit a manuscript of Virgil, written
on parchment in the Italian book hand of
the thirteenth or fourteenth century. A

manuscript in Latin prose which dates
back to the fifteenth century and is a
source of many of the versions of the
siege of Troy, was loaned by Professor
J. S. P. Tatlock.
Other parts of the exhibit are two fac
similes of early manuscripts. A volume
giving the exact color reproduction of

probably the oldest existing manuscript
of Dante's "Divine Comedy" was pre
sented by the Italian government to Stan
ford, in honor of the six hundredth anni
versary of the death of Dante. The
other is a fac-simile of the manuscript of
Ellesmere written by GeolYry Chaucer
in 1400.
