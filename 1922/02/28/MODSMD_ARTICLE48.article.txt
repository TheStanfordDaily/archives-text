"Out of the almost helpless mental de-
I pression of Germany today, comes the
hopeful spark of the 'German Youth
Movement' with its new ideas of govern
ment and social uplift." said Miss Cath
j erine Cox, '12, in her talk before the
! Cosmopolitan Club in the Women's Club-
I house last evening.
"These young people, of parents with
' radically opposite views, have joined with
a threefold purpose in view. They are
striving to make lile seem brighter, and
seek to instill dislike in the artificial life.
Along with this, they aim to have the
common people so educate themselves
that they may be fit for the occupation of
their own choosing."
Ihe speaker told of the frightful liv
ing conditions in Germany. "College stu
dents live all day on meals equivalent to
our breakfast," Miss Cox declared.
"This age of suffering will be their
blessing. The young people have learned
the lesson of the Great War, and are
spreading broadcast their new spirit of
things. May we gain as much from vic
i tory as they did from defeat," the
! speaker concluded.
