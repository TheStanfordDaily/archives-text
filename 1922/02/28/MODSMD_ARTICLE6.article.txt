# CARD FIVE FINISHES FIFTH IK CONFERENCE
## Idaho Wins Conference Title; Washington and California in Fight for Second Place 
### 
For members of the varsity quintet,
another chapter has been completed
in the history of basketball, and their
court togs are being packed away for
another year.
While the Stanford cage season
came to an end with the game last
Saturday night at Oakland, final stand
ings in the Pacific Coast Conference
are not yet settled. The Cardinal five
is at present resting at the top of the
second division, in fifth place, with
four victories and six defeats.
Whether or not they will stay there
depends upon what success meets the
effort of Washington State in its re
maining contests. The Cougars will
have to gather in a brace of wins to
overtake Van Gent's charges in the
rating, despite the fact that the latter
were beaten twice by W. S. C. this
year.
Two weeks have passed since Idaho
brought Washington to earth and the
Vandals are still at the top of the
heap, and likely to stay there.
The real race is for second place,
with California and the Huskies as
the contenders. The Seattle lads, once
figured as sure winners of the title,
are on the toboggan for fair, and were
beaten last week-end by the Oregon
Aggies, with the redoubtable Hjelte at
center.
The Bruins have their eyes fixed
on second place, and if there are no
more upsets, they are likely to land
the prize. Washington leads at pres
ent by a very small margin.

The cellar championship goes with
out argument to Oregon, by the widest
margin in several years, there being
no competition whatever for the berth.
Southern California has a firm ht)ld on j
the sub-cellar position.
The standings to date are:
