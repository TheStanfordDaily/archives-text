until a petition for such a special elec
tion, with not less than fifty students
signing such a petition, is presented to
the Executive Committee. If a petition
of this kind is taken to the Executive
Committee, a special election will be
called at which the student body, by a

against allowing automobiles on the
campus.

voted that Bill Burkhart and Elizabeth

form, so that no misunderstanding over
elections may occur in the future.

that the Board of Athletic Control meet
the expenses of the band, beginning Oc
tober 1, 1922, was accepted, and it was

equipment needed by the campus fire
department, it was decided to authorize
