Paul Cowles, superintendent of the
San Francisco office of the Associated
Press, will speak at an open meeting of
the Stanford chapter of the American
Journalists' Association next Tuesday
evening. He will tell of his experiences
in connection with the world's greatest
news gathering agency, and advice for
success in newspaper work. The asso
