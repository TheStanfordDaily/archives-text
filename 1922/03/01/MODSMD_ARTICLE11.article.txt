# PLANS FOR NEW UNION COURT OUTLINED
## Sunken Garden Effect Will Be Achieved by Arrangement of Grass, Shrubs, Trees 
### 
Presenting the aspect of a sunken
garden, with a gay variety of color and
design that, it is expected, will make it
the beauty spot of the campus, the court
>«ud in i rout of the new Union will be
artistically laid out in accordance with a
scale of planting that has been worked
out especially for this situation.
1 lie courtyard is at present bounded
on three sides only by the arcades that
have been recently completed. When
the planting is finished, the center of the
court will be marked by a bed of red
flowers, making a suitable place for the
erection of a fountain, and the rest will
be laid out in plots of grass intersected
by gravel walks, with bushes and trees
growing up luxuriantly on all sides of
the court. The farther away from the
center, the higher the foliage will grow,
until at the extreme four corners will be
planted large pine trees and Italian cy
presses, with oaks placed here and there.
1 hese oaks are 30 years old, and, like
the pine trees, will be removed from the
boxes in which they have spent this
much of their life, and be transplanted
to the courtyard.
Tlie gravel used for the walks will be
red—the same kind as that which has
light and activity.
Because of the literary value of the
production, a larger block of seats has
been set aside for the faculty, who
always take advantage :of English
Club plays. These seats may be ob
tained, beginning today at J. E. Mc-
Dowell's office in the Administration
Building. They may also be reserved
by telephone. All seats in this sec
tion not spoken for before Tuefdny
morning will be turned baclc i.ito i ve
general sale, which will open .a the
Administration Building. Friday noon.
