# ALPHA DELTA PHI AND THETA CHI WIN INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
, Intramural basketball dope was upset j
| yesterday, when Theta Chi's quintet
I staged a second half scoring parade and
won from Alpha Kappa Lambda, 21-12.
j Alpha Delta Phi's team annexed its third I
i straight victory in the final series by de-'
! feating Phi Kappa Sigma, 19-8.
Alpha Kappa Lambda held lirst hon
ors at half time with a four-point lead,
12 to iS. Rawlins, Cornell, and Howe
were going fine, and all the good luck
seemed to be on their side. The A. K. L.
five was playing a better game both on
offense and defense, than Theta Chi.
Howe scored in the first minute of play
and added two more baskets during the j
! half. Rawlins eluded his guards and j
I dropped the ball through the hoop twice, j
j Cornell made two points.
The pace quickened in the second half i
| and all the horseshoes were cornered by
i Theta Chi. However, the latter's for
: ward combination played together more
! smoothly, and a considerably stiffened
defense forced the opposing forwards to |
take longer shots at the basket than in j
i the first period. Theta Chi used a four-1
I man offense that proved effective.
In the first few minutes of the half,
j Smith, center, found the basket twice
I and the score. Another field goal by j
j Hogle gave Theta Chi the lead. From j
I then on it was mostly a case of Smith, j
| Blosser. and Hogle working the 1 mil I
j down the court, and Hogle scoring.
Hogle performed the stunt of making
i field goals six times during the game.
J Blosser was center on the 130-pound I
I team which defeated California, and
| Hogle also played against the Blue and
| Gold. Short shots did the trick.
Alpha Delta Phi's court machine ran
I true to form and rolled up 12 points in
the first half, at the same time holding
Phi Kappa Sigma scoreless. The win
ners played a five-man defense to good
advantage, and kept possession of the
ball most of the time. Short, snappy
passes and accurate shooting featured
the work of the offense.
"Hank" Gerson seemed to cast a spell
over the casaba, and tossed it into the
net from all angles, scoring 12 of the 21
tallies. Neer made the remaining num
ber of points. Dennis and Cairns played
a steady defensive game, while Pollard
was an excellent standing guard.
The Phi Kappa Sigma basketers took j
a new lease on life in the second period j
and managed to register four field goals.]
Crandall was responsible for two has-j
kets. Thomas and Coulthurst made the i
other four points.
