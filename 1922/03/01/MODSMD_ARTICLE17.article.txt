# TALENTED TRIO LEADS CAST OF PERIOD DRAMA
## Lester Seib, Helen Whitney and Violet Andrews Said to Reach Unusual Heights 
### 
A triumvirate of the best dramatic
talent on the eampus will lead the
large east of "If 1 Were King" in the
annual English Club play, Wednesday
evening, March 8.
Lester Seib, '22, will make his ap
pearance in the role of Francois Vil
lon, the vagabond poet of France in
the fourteenth century. In the opinion
of Gordon Davis, Seib will present the
best student acting ever seen here.
"If I Were King" will give him great
er opportunity than his previous ap
pearances.
Helen Whitney, '24, is fitting ad
mirably into the part of Huguette, the
carefree girl in the Inns whose wor
ship of Villon runs through the play
until her tragically beautiful death in
the third act. Display of every emo
tion which has stirred woman is neces
sary in the part, and Miss Whitney,
says Davis, has proved by her inter
pretation of these emotions that she
is a real actress.
Violet Andrews, '22, has opportunity
to reach unusual dramatic heights in
portraying Lady Katherine du Hamel.
Her scornful denunciation of the lowly
Villon in the third act is said to be
a masterpiece in historic ability.
Davis is exercising care in working
out the ensemble scenes in detaik
During the whole first act, which takes
place in a French inn, there are never
fewer than fifteen people on the stage.
Their moving about and action, shows
an ever-changing picture of color,
shown tip so well on the track in the
new stadium. With the color scheme of
the whole arrangement is expected to
come an atmosphere of beauty, some
what on the Spanish order, that will
make this place one of the most popu
lar scenic spots on the campus.
Outdoor dinners can be held in the
courtyard, and the terrace that rises
about a foot from the ordinary level in
front of the main entrance to the Union
will be in effect a natural platform. The
general impression gained will be a com
bination of arcades and outdoors.
Soon alterations in the walks leading
into the Women's Clubhouse and the
old Union will be made to conform with
the general design. Otherwise the chief
changes to be noted will be additions in
the way of landscape architecture.
