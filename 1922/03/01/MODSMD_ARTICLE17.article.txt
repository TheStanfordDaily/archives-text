A triumvirate of the best dramatic
talent on the eampus will lead the
large east of "If 1 Were King" in the
annual English Club play, Wednesday
evening, March 8.
Lester Seib, '22, will make his ap
pearance in the role of Francois Vil
lon, the vagabond poet of France in
the fourteenth century. In the opinion
of Gordon Davis, Seib will present the
best student acting ever seen here.
"If I Were King" will give him great
er opportunity than his previous ap
pearances.
Helen Whitney, '24, is fitting ad
mirably into the part of Huguette, the
carefree girl in the Inns whose wor
ship of Villon runs through the play
until her tragically beautiful death in
the third act. Display of every emo
tion which has stirred woman is neces
sary in the part, and Miss Whitney,
says Davis, has proved by her inter
pretation of these emotions that she
is a real actress.
Violet Andrews, '22, has opportunity
to reach unusual dramatic heights in
portraying Lady Katherine du Hamel.
Her scornful denunciation of the lowly
Villon in the third act is said to be
a masterpiece in historic ability.
Davis is exercising care in working
out the ensemble scenes in detaik
During the whole first act, which takes
place in a French inn, there are never
fewer than fifteen people on the stage.
Their moving about and action, shows
an ever-changing picture of color,
