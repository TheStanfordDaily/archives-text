With the signing up of Glenn Warner for head
coach of the Cardinals from 1924, the University
of Pittsburgh takes an unkind view of the fact, hold
ing that Warner is doing the college dirt by accept
ing the Stanford position at the present and dividing
his interests for the next two years while he is per
haps to stay at the eastern university. Pittsburgh
realizes, evidently, that the going of Warner means
a good deal to it in the way of sport and lays the
blame on him for contemplatd ills which they are not
sure will befall them.
Stanford comes in for a share of the censure which
is falling on the famous coach. In one of the Pitt
publications there appears the following piece:
Ix'land Stanford, great and rcspccted university that it is,
has done an unprecedented thing in signing up Warner, Kerr,
and Thornhill. It has in a way stolen from us three big men
whom Pitt needed and has made itself a party to the wreck
ing of Pitt's coaching system. We feel that Stanford should
not get out of the situation without some censure at least
for its breach of ethics.
Particular stress is laid on the fact that Kerr and
Jhornhill, Pitt's freshman coach and the line coach
at Centre, are coming to Stanford this year. There
is also an intimation that Warner may have had some
dark motive for his seeming sudden action in signing
up for the position of Coach here. On reading
through the whole article in which the previous quota
tion is contained it comes home with considerable
force that some one is pulling rank sour grapes and
making "Pop" Warner the goat.
11 has been no secret that Warner wanted, to come
west, and his acceptance of the Stanford offer did
not come as a surprise to people in touch with the
sporting world. His bringing of Thornhill and Kerr
is only natural, as they are the two men in whom he
â– can best rely to install his system of coaching.
So far as to imputing "divided interest" to Warner
while he stays in the eastern college, if he stays, it
would hardly seem consistent in one who is calling
another guilty of bad faith to criticise a man who has
meant so much to Pittsburgh and sport for so many
years. Stanford University had no other idea when
signing up Warner than to get an excellent coach
who was available, and overheated sparks from the
pen of some undergraduate are not received too kind
lv by parties to a fair contract made in the best
interest of those concerned.
Another point which strikes us as funny is that so
much should be said about Warner's bad faith when
Pitt people are making the holler that they are to
have him stay on the job there.
