# NUMBER, PLEASE
## 
### 
If you were asked what is the number of the fire
department, what would you say? If in the same
class with eighteen out of twenty-one people asked
the question today, you would have to answer to the
effect that you didn't know unless it was on the Uni
versity exchange. When a fire breaks out in the
neighborhood and you do not know the number of the
fire hall you can't warn the department so that they
can get there quickly. Learn the number tonight,
and it may come in handy when a blaze springs up
in one of the dwellings on the campus. Ihe call of
the firehouse is Palo Alto 900 Local 2.
In living groups the fire-whistle chart would make
a good addition to any phone booth and prove a handy
medium of information for anyone reporting a lire
so that a complete location of it could be given at the
time of telephning.
