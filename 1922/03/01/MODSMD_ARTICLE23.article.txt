# THE 						GLEE CLUB
## 
### 
The following, from the Daily Palo Alto limes,
makes clear the regard in which the Stanford Glee,
Club is held by people not in particularly close asso

ciation with the University. The classical program
which the club will present changes its whole charac
ter from an amateur group to one that has attained
professional standards:
The Stanford Glee Club is being advertised, in connec
tion with its appearance in San Francisco early next month,
as a college men's singing organization that has abandoned
the "old rah-rah type of program and has worked up pro
grams that are more than merely entertaining." Artistic re
. suits are the objects of their efforts, and as a result the
Stanford singers have appeared as guest artists with the San
Francisco and the Los Angeles symphony orchestras, a
signal honor, the like of which, it is said, no other college
glee club except Harvard's has equaled.
The old-time college glee club used to file out upon the
stage, seeming very young and dressed-up and sleek, look
at each other expectantly, and then burst out into melody,
spontaneously and of its ow« volition, as it were. And at
the conclusion of the ditty we applauded riotously as they
Indian-filed rapidly away, only to about-face immediately
and form again into their gleaming, white-shirt-bosomed
crescent to sing another. Now it comes out most decorously,
fixes its eyes attentively and obediently upon the baton of its
serious-minded leader and attacks the first note with exactly
the right force and volume. And gives us first-class music
with the beauty that only fresh, well-drilled young male
voices can produce. It's artistic and in every way praise
worthy; no doubt, of its being better for us and for them
than the old boyish foolishness. Of course it is.
All the same, ashamed though, maybe, we ought to be,
most of us will wait with especially pleasurable anticipation
for—we note it is promised even though stress is laid on the
artistic merit of the program—the fun hinted at in the con
cession, "and light numbers for amusement's sake." The
old college glee club used to be so amusing.
Any institution profits by favorable advertising,
and a grooup of well-trained singers, through their
general popular appeal, can do practically as much as
any other element in the University to make Stan
ford known as a place where things are actually being
accomplished. Warren D. Allen and the Glee Club,
which he has directed, have spent much time and
effort in preparing their program, which will take
the Stanford r\ame and spirit into several communi
ties this spring. Students will have their first oppor
tunity of seeing the result of that work at the open
ing concert on the campus Saturday evening.
