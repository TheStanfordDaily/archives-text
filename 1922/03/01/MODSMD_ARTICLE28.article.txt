PROTECTORATE abandoned
England has abandoned her protec
torate over Egypt, so that the latter
may be free to work out such national
institutions as might be suited to the
aspirations of her people. Martial law
will be abolished as soon as an Â»act
of indemnity has been passed. It was
explained by Lloyd George that the
martial law was used only to aid the
Egyptian ministers, and was not as a
tool in the hands of the British gov
ernment.
Although the protectorate has been
abandoned, England retains certain
rights in connection with Egypt. These
include security of British communica
tions in Egypt, defense of Egypt
against all foreign aggression, direct
or indirect, and protection of the for
eign interests of Egypt and the pro
tection of minorities.
SHIP SUBSIDY URGED
Direct aid to the merchant marine
at a cost to the government of from
fifteen milions to possibly thirty mil
lions annually, was urged by Presi
dent Harding in his message to Con
gress yesterday. Points brought out
by the President were that the mer
chant marine created as a war-time
veil Aire has been a costly failure; that
the ship subsidy plan formed of sug
gestions from Government shipping ex
perts would bring return of private
initiative and private enterprise; that
an adequate merchant marine is now
needed to promte the commerce of
America to a position equal to its
cargoes entering American ports, in
stead of exempting some and taxing
others.
TO PAY IN GOLD AND GOODS
Germany will now pay the annual
indemnity due, by means of gold and
goods, according to an agreement
reached by the reparations commis
sion. The annual payment of gold
marks will be 720,000,000, and of gold
i marks in kind, 1,450,000',000.
