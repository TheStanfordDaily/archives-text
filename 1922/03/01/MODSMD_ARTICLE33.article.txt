UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eugene,
Ore., March 1. (P.I.N.S.) â€”Although
final action on the proposed plan of
Saturday classes will not be taken
until the next faculty meeting, early
in March, nearly all the faculty mem
bers on the campus regard them as
inevitable because of the congested
condition of classrooms at the pres
ent time.
