### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eugene,
Ore., March 1. (P.1.N.5.) — Senior
"leap week" reached its climax when
the women of Hendricks Hall, one of
the women's dormitories entertained
the men of '22, and their female
escorts with a "barrom bust." It is
reported that the proverbial "Ten
Nights in a Barroom" was put to
shame in comparison with this affair.
Guns and sombreros were a prominent
part of the equipment and beer with
a root in it (some say the root of
evil) was served over the bar by a
relic of the days of '49. The success
of senior "leap week" this year will
undoubtedly lead to its adoption as a
campus tradition.
