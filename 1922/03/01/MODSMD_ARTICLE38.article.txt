Indians of a neighboring tribe took
interest in his crude drawings, and
showed him to mix and use colors.
During his eighteenth year, he went
to New York and later to Italy and

England. King George 111 becoming
interested in him, appointed him in
1772, historic painter to the king. He
was one of the founders of the Royal
Academy.

early Americau Art has increased the
attention given West's work, and the
American artists and collectors are
becoming convinced that contempo
rary judgment which ranked him with
the old masters, was justifiable.
