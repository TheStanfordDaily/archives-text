"It's the man behind the gun wlio gets
tlie best pictures, and not the one with
j merely the best camera," said Kenneth
I Ritchie, '21. speaking to a gathering of
camera enthusiasts in the Union last
night.
"Success in picture-taking depends i
j upon the knowledge of the weather con
j ditions one is working in, the proper
' manipulation of the shutter and the
: speeds, and the man who makes liis ex
posure with intelligent use of these de
vices is assured results," Ritchie con
tinued.
The speaker explained the purposes of
the different parts of the kodak and
methods of using them. He said the
blurred condition of pictures taken with
single lenses in cheap cameras is the
effect of the varied focus lengths of dif
eferent colors. Achromatic lenses in the j
more expensive kodaks eliminate this I
difficulty.
