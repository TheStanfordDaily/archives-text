# DEBATE SITUATION IS DISCUSSED BY PROFESSOR EMERSON
## Greater Support Necessary; Quality of Team Good Opinion of Coach 
### 
"Debating material at Stanford is as
good as that at any other university,
but there isn't as much to it," ac
cording to Professor James Gordon
Emerson, Stanford debating coach.
"There were only ten tryoutees for
places on the Tri-State debating team
and thirteen for the Medaille Joffre
debate team. - T n almost any other
university, and especially in the small
er denominational colleges which have
elevated debating to the rank of a
major activity, there would have been
many times that number of tryoutees
for each of these teams.
"In many universities throughout
the East and Middle West the stu
dents encourage their forensic teams
by songs, yells, banners, and the loyal
support of an organized body of en
thusiastic fans. Interest in debating
is in the ascendency in these institu
tions because the students realize the
importance of being able to analyze
keenly and to discuss intelligently and
forcefully the vital problems of the
day.
"Debating itself," says Emerson, "is
partly responsible. for the slough of
disinterest into which it had fallen
for a time. The unsportsmanlike
tactics, haggling, intellectual dis
honesty, basing a case on a technicali
ty, contesting the decision of a judge
and other like practices did i uu.h to
alienate the interest of broad-minded
students. But in the big universities
such tactics are no longer practiced.
Questions are discussed purely on the
merits of the case; and so debating
is now able to stand squarely on its
own feet and make a justifiable bid
for the attention and support of uni
versity men and women. It is not
expected that debating will supersede
athletics and social activities as an
item of student interest, but it is en
titled to a place more nearly on an
equality with that occupied by those
two.
"I wish to take issue very sharply
with those who feel that the oral de
bate idea has no place in a univer
sity. It is here that the leaders and
moulders of public opinion of the next
generation are being trained. The
university curriculum provides them
with the ability to attack a problem
and solve it intelligently, but it does
not. sufficiently provide them with the
ability to stand on their feet and pre
sent the result of their effort in a con
vincing manner to other persons of
t!ie community. Sound conclusions,
intelligently arrived at are almost
valueless socially, politically, and
economically, unless they can be con
vincingly presented to others. Al
most invariably those students attend
ing Harvard Law School who have
taKen their preliminary work in some
university where debating is stressed
as a popular student activity, make
better records than those who have
not had such a thorough training in
forensic work.
"If debating is not. right at. Stan
ford," said Emerson, "we should make
it right. T am, therefore, thankful for
the recent helpful criticisms which
have appeared in the Daily Palo Alto.
1 feel, however, that as Stanford stu
dents see that debating is sincere and
valuable, they will take an active in
terest in it. It can never come back
until it receives the interest and sup
port of the student body."

er denominational colleges which have
elevated debating to the rank of a
major activity, there would have been
many times that number of tryoutees
for each of these teams.
"In many universities throughout
the East and Middle West the stu
dents encourage their forensic teams
by songs, yells, banners, and the loyal
support of an organized body of en
thusiastic fans. Interest in debating
is in the ascendency in these institu
tions because the students realize the
importance of being able to analyze
keenly and to discuss intelligently and
forcefully the vital problems of the
day.
"Debating itself," says Emerson, "is
partly responsible. for the slough of
disinterest into which it had fallen
for a time. The unsportsmanlike
tactics, haggling, intellectual dis
honesty, basing a case on a technicali
ty, contesting the decision of a judge
and other like practices did i uu.h to
alienate the interest of broad-minded
students. But in the big universities
such tactics are no longer practiced.
Questions are discussed purely on the
merits of the case; and so debating
is now able to stand squarely on its
own feet and make a justifiable bid
for the attention and support of uni
versity men and women. It is not
expected that debating will supersede
athletics and social activities as an
item of student interest, but it is en
titled to a place more nearly on an
equality with that occupied by those
two.
"I wish to take issue very sharply
with those who feel that the oral de
bate idea has no place in a univer
sity. It is here that the leaders and
moulders of public opinion of the next
generation are being trained. The
university curriculum provides them
with the ability to attack a problem
and solve it intelligently, but it does
not. sufficiently provide them with the
ability to stand on their feet and pre
sent the result of their effort in a con
vincing manner to other persons of
t!ie community. Sound conclusions,
intelligently arrived at are almost
valueless socially, politically, and
economically, unless they can be con
vincingly presented to others. Al
most invariably those students attend
ing Harvard Law School who have
taKen their preliminary work in some
university where debating is stressed
as a popular student activity, make
better records than those who have
not had such a thorough training in
forensic work.
"If debating is not. right at. Stan
ford," said Emerson, "we should make
it right. T am, therefore, thankful for
the recent helpful criticisms which
have appeared in the Daily Palo Alto.
1 feel, however, that as Stanford stu
dents see that debating is sincere and
valuable, they will take an active in
terest in it. It can never come back
until it receives the interest and sup
port of the student body."
"Debating material at Stanford is as
good as that at any other university,
