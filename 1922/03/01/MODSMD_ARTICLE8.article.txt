# RUSSIAN MUSIC IS HEARD AT RECITAL
## Dr. Henry Lanz Gives History of Slavic Folk and Church Songs at Lecture-Recital 
### 
"Russian music, is as old as the
country itself and not an outgrowth of
the last century, as is popularly be
lieved," said Dr. Henry Lanz in his
lecture-recital 011 Russian ipusic last
night in the Little Theatre.
"Such force, such perfection and
such artistry could not have been
brought about in fifty or a hundred
years, it is in the folk songs and the j
church melodies of Russia that the
modern music had its beginnings."
Dr. Lanz gave a brief explanation
of the peculiar characteristics of the
Russian folk songs. They are a part
of the national life. Not one of them
was composed by an individual man,
for they are the product of groups
and have developed slowly through the
long and tragic history of Russia.
There are folk songs from every class
of people: workmen, students, pirates,
boatmen, robbers, and many others.
Taken out of their environment, they
lose all meaning and cannot be ap
preciated. Dr. Lanz played several
examples of folk songs.
"The church music," said Dr. Lanz,
"is the other source of the modern
productions. It is an essential part
of the church service and consists of
a series of responses sung by the
choir during the symbolic movements
of the priest. To take it out of the
church service is make it senseless.
But for the Russian it is an inex
haustible source of emotion. This is
due to the fact that the church has al-,
ways been very powerful in control-j
ing the masses of Russian people, j
Every one of the modern composers
of that country is under the strong'
influence of this church music, for it
is the origin of their first artistic in-!
spirations." This type of music was ;
illustrated by several selections.
Dr. Lanz then discussed the Russian !
music since the beginning of the '
eighteenth century when it underwent
radical changes on account of the in
novations introduced by the emperor
and the invasion of western civiliza
tion. "Glinka was the first national
composer of Russia, but he was merely ■
a pioneer in liis art." Dr. Lanz gave j
a sketch of the life and work of Anton !
Rubinstein and played his "Kamennoi j
Ostrov." He followed this with a de-1
scription of Tchaikovsky, who. he said, !
"is the most widely-known but not
the best Russian musician."
The most important composers of
the latter part of the nineteenth cen
tury were grouped by Dr. Lanz under;
the title, "The Big Five." From this |
school he played "At the Convent," 1
by Borodin and "Song of India" by
liimsky-Korsakov. The final numbers
of the program were "Prelude No. 8"
by Skrjabin, and "Prelude 111 C sharp
minor," by Rachmaninoff.

boatmen, robbers, and many others.
Taken out of their environment, they
lose all meaning and cannot be ap
preciated. Dr. Lanz played several
examples of folk songs.
"The church music," said Dr. Lanz,
"is the other source of the modern
productions. It is an essential part
of the church service and consists of
a series of responses sung by the
choir during the symbolic movements
of the priest. To take it out of the
church service is make it senseless.
But for the Russian it is an inex
haustible source of emotion. This is
due to the fact that the church has al-,
ways been very powerful in control-j
ing the masses of Russian people, j
Every one of the modern composers
of that country is under the strong'
influence of this church music, for it
is the origin of their first artistic in-!
spirations." This type of music was ;
illustrated by several selections.
Dr. Lanz then discussed the Russian !
music since the beginning of the '
eighteenth century when it underwent
radical changes on account of the in
novations introduced by the emperor
and the invasion of western civiliza
tion. "Glinka was the first national
composer of Russia, but he was merely ■
a pioneer in liis art." Dr. Lanz gave j
a sketch of the life and work of Anton !
Rubinstein and played his "Kamennoi j
Ostrov." He followed this with a de-1
scription of Tchaikovsky, who. he said, !
"is the most widely-known but not
the best Russian musician."
The most important composers of
the latter part of the nineteenth cen
tury were grouped by Dr. Lanz under;
the title, "The Big Five." From this |
school he played "At the Convent," 1
by Borodin and "Song of India" by
liimsky-Korsakov. The final numbers
of the program were "Prelude No. 8"
by Skrjabin, and "Prelude 111 C sharp
minor," by Rachmaninoff.
"Russian music, is as old as the
country itself and not an outgrowth of
the last century, as is popularly be
lieved," said Dr. Henry Lanz in his
lecture-recital 011 Russian ipusic last
night in the Little Theatre.
"Such force, such perfection and
such artistry could not have been
brought about in fifty or a hundred
years, it is in the folk songs and the j
church melodies of Russia that the
modern music had its beginnings."
Dr. Lanz gave a brief explanation
of the peculiar characteristics of the
Russian folk songs. They are a part
of the national life. Not one of them
was composed by an individual man,
for they are the product of groups
and have developed slowly through the
long and tragic history of Russia.
There are folk songs from every class
of people: workmen, students, pirates,
boatmen, robbers, and many others.
Taken out of their environment, they
lose all meaning and cannot be ap
preciated. Dr. Lanz played several
