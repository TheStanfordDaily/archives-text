# IRISH MARATHON WILL OPEN TRACK SEASON SATURDAY
## Three-legged Race, Backward Walk, Greased Pig Contest, Are Innovations to Come 
### 
Bigger than ever before, the Irish
Marathon, scheduled Saturday after
noon at 2 o'clock, is planned by Quad
rangle Club to include several events not
previously a part of the day's program.
Besides the marathon itself, and the
holdover show, there will be a 100-yard
three-legged race, a 100-yard backward
race, and a quarter mile walk. Arrange
ments are being completed for a greased
pig contest. These events are not limited
to classes.
Awards for proficiency in the various
events will be made by Roos Brothers,
Wideman's, Tlioits', and Frielander and
Xauman. The prizes average about $4
each in merchandise.
The holdover show lias been writ
ten by Tom Irwin, and will be given
under the direction of Dan Evans.
According to advance press notices, it
will present the unusual though thrill
ing spectacle of a somewhat irresist
ible body meeting a more or less im
movable force. The force was chosen,
and parts assigned, at a session of the
holdover si row committee in the Union
late this afternoon.
Final tryouts for the marathon
teams are being held today. The
freshmen, sophomores, and juniors
have their twenty-four runners prac
tically all chosen as the result of pre
vious tests. The senior and holdover
squad is still in need of more men of
ability, and Captain Bill Comstock
announces that he will hold open his
lists until the last minute in order
that more may turn out. According
to the times shown so far, and the
amount of previous ability of 'the
squads, the race is expected to be
between the juniors and the sopho
mores, as was the case last year,
when the '23 class won. With a week
of sunshine, the track will be fairly
fast, although it is still a lit tie soft
in the center.
Medals for the fastest varsity time,
and for the fastest non-varsity time
will be given by Quadrangle Club. A
member of the club will supervise
each class in the race, working with
