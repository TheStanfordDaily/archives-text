# SEAY'S NINE LOSES TO INDEPENDENTS, 3-1
## Visitors Annex Two Runs in Opening Frame That Win Game, Loewenstein Pitches 
### 
"Cliff" Ireland's Independents in
flicted a second defeat on Coach Seay's
v. rsitv '.aseball player- by as "ore of
3 to 1 when the two nines met on the
local lot vesterdav afternoon. The visit
ors won because they bunched their hits,
which they made count for tallies by
fast base running.
Al Loewenstein did the chucking for
the Car ls and managed to hold "Cliff's"
gtkng in check by feeding them balls
which drew a large number of high flies,
both to the infield and outfield. Main
taining a clean error column throughout
the .arte, the varsity fielding machine
was running in world-beating fashion.
But Manotick, the visiting slabstcr. sim
ply outpitehed Loewenstein, getting four
strike-outs against a solitary one, and
holding Seay's hitters to scattered hits
which were wasted.
The first frame was the one which
told the story. Murray got on with a
walk. Armstrong hit to left for a single
and. with two men on the bases and
none awav, Loewenstein was in a bole.
Bohnc capped the climax bv hitting an-
other single to left which scored Mur-j
ray. George Kelly, first baseman for the j
New York Giants, has not reported for;
training yet and came down with "Cliff."
He was the next man up and hit a lohg ;
fly to left. Carver pulled it down, but \
Armstrong came home for the second j
marker, liohne tried to beat the throw j
in also, but was caught at the plate, j
} Stalker put another one in Carver's 1
' trusty mitt and the first spasm of the
I Independents was over.
The visitors went down in quick suc
■ cession in the third, but the Cards started
| out like a million dollars, and it looked
like a score for sure. Loewenstein took
j the first of his two hits and Mitchell fol
| lowed him with a single to center. Pat
j terson sacrificed A! to third. Hecken- j
I dorf hit an infield grounder and Loewen- !
J stein started home, but was caught mid- j
j way and put.out. This inning, which j
; should have tied the score, was an ex
ample of the inability of the Cards to j
make use of hits.
In the fourth the visitors got busy j
j again and added the third score to their j
record. Stalker reached first with a j
j single and scored when Powell hit a low I
fly to left which took a bad hop and I
went through Carver.
Maillot smashed out a triple to right j
in the seventh and Loewenstein brought j
him home with a single.
Ratner got a blow to right in the
eighth, but there were two gone and he
died on first. As a parting token of good
will, "Cliff" walked up to the plate in the >
ninth, tapped the rubber with his stick. |
gave the bill of bis cap a hitch, and j
\ swung on the pellet for a single to left.
The three men who followed him flew
out and the little veteran never budged j
from first.
The box score follows:

Off Manouck, 1 ; off Loewenstein. 2.

"Cliff" Ireland's Independents in
flicted a second defeat on Coach Seay's
v. rsitv '.aseball player- by as "ore of
3 to 1 when the two nines met on the
local lot vesterdav afternoon. The visit
ors won because they bunched their hits,
which they made count for tallies by
fast base running.
Al Loewenstein did the chucking for
the Car ls and managed to hold "Cliff's"
gtkng in check by feeding them balls
which drew a large number of high flies,
both to the infield and outfield. Main
taining a clean error column throughout
the .arte, the varsity fielding machine
was running in world-beating fashion.
But Manotick, the visiting slabstcr. sim
ply outpitehed Loewenstein, getting four
strike-outs against a solitary one, and
holding Seay's hitters to scattered hits
which were wasted.
The first frame was the one which
told the story. Murray got on with a
walk. Armstrong hit to left for a single
and. with two men on the bases and
none awav, Loewenstein was in a bole.
Bohnc capped the climax bv hitting an-
other single to left which scored Mur-j
ray. George Kelly, first baseman for the j
New York Giants, has not reported for;
training yet and came down with "Cliff."
He was the next man up and hit a lohg ;
fly to left. Carver pulled it down, but \
Armstrong came home for the second j
marker, liohne tried to beat the throw j
in also, but was caught at the plate, j
} Stalker put another one in Carver's 1
' trusty mitt and the first spasm of the
I Independents was over.
The visitors went down in quick suc
■ cession in the third, but the Cards started
| out like a million dollars, and it looked
like a score for sure. Loewenstein took
j the first of his two hits and Mitchell fol
| lowed him with a single to center. Pat
