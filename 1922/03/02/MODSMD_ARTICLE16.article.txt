the man who rung the basket for the
Calit'ornians in the last game here.
Kyte, will be center again probably.
Buckley, and Gootch, the powerful
little blonde, will take the standing
and running guard positions.
On the open floor of the Oakland
Auditorium the difference in weight
of the California forwards will be
compensated for by the speed of the
Stanford pair. In Shipkey and Steele
Stanford has both speed and weight
for the guard jobs. The contest looks
like an even one since it is being held
on„ the Oakland court.
The freshman basketball live meets
the Cubs from the University of Cali
fornia den tomorrow night in the
third and deciding game of the babe
big series. Both teams stand even
now and are out to do or die, for on
this game binges the title to the
freshman basketball series and the
question of whether the Cardinal
youngsters can put over the wallop
ing 011 the Blue and Gold that was
served in the last game here.
Oakland Auditorium will be the
scene of the fray and the time will
be 7:oO as there is to be no pre-,
liminary.
Hoffman, captain of the Babes will
lead off as forward with Alexander as
his working partner, lloffman has
improved in shooting accuracy over
even his last appesranee on the court
and should be a sure thing when down
in Bruin territory. Alexander has had
another week of practice with Hoff
man since his last game and the com
bination that the two have worked out
ought to wark perfectly with the
new formations for offense that have
been worked out by the coach.
Archie Steele who jumped into fame
as a center of merit and all around
good player when he substituted in
the first California game will open
up in the middle position. His jump
ing and excellent work in guarding
against any offense makes him one of
the best and most valuable men on the
squad.
Shipkey, the big running guard of
tiie Babes, broke through the Bear
defense repeatedly and got the ball
down to within shooting distance of
the goal before. His work has been
coordinated with the two forwards
now so that the holes which existed
in the offense then are now filled.
Oliva the man who grabs the sphere
at the dangerous end of the court will
form the last line of defense for the
Cardinals in the position made famous
by Fred Adams of the '21 varsity.
Clement and Farrar will form the
forward combination for the Blue and
Gold. Farrar will be remembered as
the man who rung the basket for the
Calit'ornians in the last game here.
Kyte, will be center again probably.
Buckley, and Gootch, the powerful
little blonde, will take the standing
and running guard positions.
