In the passing of John Casper Branner Stanford
University loses one of its best loved leaders. Doc
tor Branner came to the University as one of the first
of the "Old Guard" under Doctor Jordan, and served
first as head of the Geology Department, then as
Vice-President, and later, when Doctor Jordan was
promoted to be chancellor, Doctor Branner was
elected to fill his place. He was President of the
University from 1913 until 1916, when he resigned
and Doctor Wilbur was chosen to succeed him.
Doctor Branner's death comes as the climax to
an illness of a number of years, which has grown
worse during the past year and a half, during which
he has been confined at home. The illness first arose
from fever caught while on geology research work
in Brazil.
This death marks the loss of one more of the old
regime whom we have learned to love and respect,
and we mourn the loss of such a personality from
the "family."
