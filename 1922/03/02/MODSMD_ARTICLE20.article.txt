# INTER-COLLEGIATE DEBATE
## 
### 
Tonight and tomorrow night Stanford debaters
are meeting men from two other colleges in the Tri-
State Debate. Tonight the contest will be at Wash
ington University, where our team will argue for
the negative, and in the meeting here tomorrow night
will have the Stanford speakers on the affirmative
side with Oregon upholding the negative.
The men who are debating for Stanford have done
all that is in their power to do to make a win for
Stanford. Coach Emerson says there is a reasonable
expectation of winning. A real representation of
Stanford' people in the assembly hall will help the
speakers to put that little bit more into their talks
that may be the deciding facor in the final judgment.
