# IRISH MARATHON

### 
The Irish Marathon coming Saturday brings the
four classes of the University once more together to
test their strength of will and lack of condition, and
to herald the coming of spring and the opening of
the track season. Men who can run will be out from
all the classes and men who have never run before
will also try their best to put up a good showing.
This is the only time of the year when all four
classes get into athletic competition together, and is
incidentally one of the best times to see good comedy
pulled off when the many would-be athletes and
won't-be athletes do their stuff and then finish with
a dramatic fade-out and a couple of loops.
