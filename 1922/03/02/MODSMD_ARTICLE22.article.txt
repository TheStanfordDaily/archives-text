# FACULTY SUPPORT
## 
### 
The Faculty at a meeting recently voted to con
tribute as a group to the endowment fund. This
might, to the person not acquainted with Stanford
faculty men and women, seem sort of funny on
account of the fact that the "First Million" is to
make possible a raise of the level of professor's
salaries.
There is, however, a completely different view to
he taken of the faculty action. It brings out clearly
that the faculty which is here sees the need of the
University for the permanent endowment to carry
on the* work here. The present faculty, the group
which is most closely in touch with scholastic needs
here, is in a position to realize our need for more
teachers, and with this idea in mind they are going
on record in a material manner as showing them
selves in favor of the movement to expand the I tii
versity into a bigger and better Stanford.
