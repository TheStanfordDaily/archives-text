# ROOT AND WIN
## 
### 
"If a sufficient nutnljcr of rooters accompany the
Babe Basketball team to Oakland tomorrow night

Stanford will win from California," said an athlete
who saw the freshman lose at Berkeley two weeks
ago and also saw the second game in the local pa
vilion which was won by the Babes.
The Babes are no hardier than other Stanford ath
letic teams, and they play best when they are being
urged by a goodly bafid of supporters. The story of
the first game tells how the freshmen fought a lone
battle against two thousand California rooters and
the Bruin Cub five. The second game is the reverse
with the California cubs playing the lone hand.
There is apparently very little difference between
the two teams as is evidenced by the scores of the
two games already played. The team that is sup
ported the best will likely win tomorrow night's con
test. California rooters will be on hand in large
numbers. Will Stanford students be there to sup
port the Babe quintet? This is the l>est chance so
far this season to score a victory over Berkeley.
