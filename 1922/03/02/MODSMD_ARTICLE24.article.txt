# UP TO STUDENTS
## 
### 
The action of the Executive Committee putting the
matter of restricting the use of student-owned auto
mobiles on the campus up to student petition places
the issue from its initiation directly in the hands
of Stanford men and women as a body.
In campus publications from time to time have
appeared articles regarding the matter either for or
against it. Here is a possibility of quick solution of
the matter one way or the other, and the students
must decide for themselves whether they wish to do
away with automobiles on the campus as far as per
sonally owned machines go. If such is the sentiment
of a majority of the campus a general vote can be
demanded by a petition with fifty names names on it
being presented to the Executive Committee. This
vote will determine whether student opinion is for or
against the measure only in case a fully representa
tive number vote at the polls. It is commonly said
and borne out by the facts that it is easy to get signa
tures to any petition among a community, and the
general rule is that the affirmative side of an argu
ment is easier to carry than a negative because the
people directly interested will turn out to cast a vote
where those not caring one way or the other will not
trouble to record their opiniojx
This is the way that most elections and amend
ments have gone in the past. Those who have spon
sored the move have organized a small but com
pact group, and this has been enough to swing the
proposition against a neglecting group which has
been a good many times considerably in the ma
jority. If the initiatory petition which the Execu
tive Committee names as the way to start the move
ment is presented it will be the duty of every mem
ber of the student body to go to the polls and make
his choice so that the final vote may leave no doubt
that it is the expressed wish of all the students either
to have machines on the campus as a regular thing or
to do away with them for gobd. The matter of pri
mary interest will show itself by the presentation or
non-presentation of the petition to the Executive
Committee.
