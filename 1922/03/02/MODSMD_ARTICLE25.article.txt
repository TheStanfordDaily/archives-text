# CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
## 
### 
The challenge of the University of California rug
by team to the Cardinals finds a ready acceptance by
an interested group here who still stick to the English
sport since it has been relegated to the ranks of minor
sports. Many of the men who have represented Stan
ford on the fifteen for several years are not now in
the University or are ineligible for one reason or
another. The team will be made up from a group
which has not played together in previous games to
a considerable extent, but this group has been prac
ticing together all this week and has worked up a
good system of teamplay which will be shown to
rugby fans on Saturday.
The charge some make that the Stanford rugby
team is a closed corporation is without foundation.
The man who in the past has played the game the
best has found a place 011 the squad and will do
so again in the coming game. Rugby fans will have
a chance to see two excellent teams in action when
the Blue and Gold and Cardinals meet in the open
game.
