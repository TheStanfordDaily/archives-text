# THE
						MILITARY BALL
## 
### 
The Stanford Military Department has recently
begun a growth which marks it as one of the most
progressive divisions in the academic life of the
University. It numbers among its personnel in the
R. O. T. C. some of the most aggressive and live
Stanford men, and it is but natural that among them
should develop an esprit de corps, a pride which
makes makes for achievement in any line of endeavor
which they undertake.
The Military Hall, to be given as an all-campus
affair tomorrow evening in the New Pavilion has
received their thought and labor. The K. O. T. C.
is striving in this way to get outside people acquainted
with it and to show that it is not merely a department
that has no interest for those who are not primarily
interested in things military. The unit is one of the
integral parts of the Stanford system and is proving
itself worthy of entire university support by the
way in which it is taking titles in the various shoots,
polo games, and drill competition with other R. O.
T. C. units in the country.
