# Sugar Refinery Films Shown; Experts Tell of Manufacturing Process

### 
Motion pictures showing the complete
process of refining sugar used by the
California-Hawaiian Refining Corpora
tion were exhibited in the Little Theater
last night.
Eighty-seven different kinds of sugar
are put out for commercial use, an
nounced Dr. E. B. Caster, an expert sent
down by tlie k plant, in a preliminary talk.
The refinery at Crockett is one of the
largest in the country, being capable of
handling the entire cane sugar product
of the Hawaiian Islands, which amounts
to more than 400,000 tons a year. The
production of the islands allows the plant
to run eleven months, whereas beet sugar
refineries run only about 100 days. Dr.
Caster compared the beet and cane sugar
refining processes. The California-
Hawaiian plant has an estimated maxi
mum daily product of 2200 tons of re
lined sugar of the different varieties, he
said, and has clock facilities which allow
2500 tons of the raw product to be taken
from ships to warehouses in eight hours.
The only other refinery which ap
proaches this capacity is in New York,
with 1000 tons capacity in eight hours.
I* int Foreman Edwards expalined the
various stages in the refining process as
they were shown in the pictures. Samples
of sugar at different intervals in the re
fining process were exhibited after the
three-reel film had been shown.
