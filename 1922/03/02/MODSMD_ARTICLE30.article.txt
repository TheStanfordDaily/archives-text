# STRAWBERRY CANYON CONSIDERED AT U.C.
## 
### 
The storm of objections tiiat has
broken over the heads of the U. C.
Board of Regents, as a result of their
decision to locate the stadium in Straw
berry Canyon, will be carefully consid
ered before tinal action is taken, accord
ing to an announcement from the board.
However, despite all protests, it seems
likely that the board will not change its
attitude, and that the canyon will be the
ultimate location for the big bowl.
The decision to locate the stadium in
this new site was taken only after months
of careful study by the regents, and they
are reluctant to change their position at
this time. Some of those who protested
against this stand claim that one of the
most beautiful spots in Berkeley would
be ruined by the stadium, and others
claim that it would be an artistic and
architectural error.
