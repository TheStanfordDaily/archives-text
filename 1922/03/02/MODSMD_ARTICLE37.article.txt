UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
SEATTLE, Wash., Mar. 2.—CP. I. N.
S.) —The rule that dancing in organized
houses on week-ends must end at eight
o'clock has been suspended by the board
of control so as to permit of more home
like entertainment. If the privilege is
abused, however, an informal date will
be taken away from that organization
abusing it.
