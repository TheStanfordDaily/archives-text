son for such an unusual bid. she said, "T
attend many of the student body assem
blies and have found extreme difficulty
while sitting in the audience to see the
platform because of the coiffure of the
girls in front of me. Then again, too
prominent ear-pugs make the girl un
attractive."

organizations on the campus.
