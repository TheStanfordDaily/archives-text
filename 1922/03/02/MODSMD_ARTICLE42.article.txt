# FRESHMEN TO MEET Y.M.I. SWIMMERS ON SATURDAY, MARCH 11
## 
### 
Ihe San Francisco Young Men's In
stitute will send its swimming team
against the Cardinal Babes Thursday
afternoon at 4:15 in the Encina pool.
I'he date of the California-Stanford
freshman meet is March 11, and Coach
Ernst Brandsten desires 'to give his
charges as much competition as possible
in order to have them in perfect condi
tion.
The strength of the Y. M. 1. squad is
unknown as this is the first meet that
this organization has participated in this
season. In past seasons many good
swimmers have worn the colors of this
club.
Captain Klebahn and Myers, who were
not able to compete against Alameda
High last Saturday, have been practic
ing for the last few days. From the times
they have been making, indications are
that they will 'add several places to the
Babes' score card.
Besides giving a great deal of atten
tion to his first-year squad, Coach Brand
sten is holding daily practices between
the freshmen and varsity water polo
teams. He has some very good material
around which he is developing two teams
that should be able to battle any of the
nearby institutions or clubs for first
honors.
Competition is being held every eve
ning for both freshman and varsity
swimming teams in all events.
