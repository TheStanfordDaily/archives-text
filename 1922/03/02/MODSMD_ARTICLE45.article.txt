# BABE TRACK SQUAD SHOWS IMPROVEMENT
## Freshmen to Hold Meet With Representatives of Four Los Angeles High Schools 
### 
Freshman track prospects indicate,
from present showings, that the year
lings have an excellent chance of taking
a string of first places in the coming
season's meets. Last night, with the
track dried out and scraped for the first
time in several weeks, a number of good
times were made, especially in the quar
ter mile by those trying for places on the
Irish Marathon team. Twelve men
have already shown to advantage in
their events, from records made in the
preliminary season, but with many of
the men not trying for points this early
in their workouts, there is a big margin
for undiscovered material.
Preliminary records slibw that the
freshmen will have strong early season
form. In the sprints Thornton and
Howard have both made records, each
registering 10:1 in the 100 yard dash.
Thornton is also counted on as a 220
man, though he has not been timed so
far. Shermund and Dole are expected
to make place winners in the quarter
mile, as Shermund has been clocked at
.51, and Dole has run to .53. Daly in the
half, and Smith in the mile have made
the best times to date in the distances,
Daly having taken the two laps in 2:00
flat, and Smith having gone around for
4:40. Charles and Holland are also
good distance men who may be expected
to place. There are not many competing
in the weight events, but with Lawson
putting the shot 39 feet in early prac
tices, Ashby throwing the discus 118
feet, and Cuddeback making 140 with
the javelin, the babe squad is assured of
putting up competition.
The hurdles are the weakest part of
the team, with no one showing as yet to
any degree of speed.
The freshmen will have their first big
meet with representatives of four Los
Angeles high schools coming here March
17. Lincoln, Los Angeles, Polytechnic,
and Hollywood will send men to this
contest. Lincoln will send four sprinters
who have made strong records *'n the
south, taking the Redlands Relay Carni
val sprint events in a clean sweep. One
of them. Miles, holds the city title in the
220. Los Angeles High has Young as
their best man in the quarter mile, but
Hollywood will have the strongest rep
resentative in this event in Coverley,
who goes around in .51 :3. In the mile
stiff competition will be furnished the
freshmen by Measelles of Hollywood
and Niersbach of Polytechnic. Terry of
Hollywood may take the broad jump if
he hits his record of 22 feet, as there
are no strong yearling competitors.

times were made, especially in the quar
ter mile by those trying for places on the
Irish Marathon team. Twelve men
have already shown to advantage in
their events, from records made in the
preliminary season, but with many of
the men not trying for points this early
in their workouts, there is a big margin
for undiscovered material.
Preliminary records slibw that the
freshmen will have strong early season
form. In the sprints Thornton and
Howard have both made records, each
registering 10:1 in the 100 yard dash.
Thornton is also counted on as a 220
man, though he has not been timed so
far. Shermund and Dole are expected
to make place winners in the quarter
mile, as Shermund has been clocked at
.51, and Dole has run to .53. Daly in the
half, and Smith in the mile have made
the best times to date in the distances,
Daly having taken the two laps in 2:00
flat, and Smith having gone around for
4:40. Charles and Holland are also
good distance men who may be expected
to place. There are not many competing
in the weight events, but with Lawson
putting the shot 39 feet in early prac
tices, Ashby throwing the discus 118
feet, and Cuddeback making 140 with
the javelin, the babe squad is assured of
putting up competition.
The hurdles are the weakest part of
the team, with no one showing as yet to
any degree of speed.
The freshmen will have their first big
meet with representatives of four Los
Angeles high schools coming here March
17. Lincoln, Los Angeles, Polytechnic,
and Hollywood will send men to this
contest. Lincoln will send four sprinters
who have made strong records *'n the
south, taking the Redlands Relay Carni
val sprint events in a clean sweep. One
of them. Miles, holds the city title in the
220. Los Angeles High has Young as
their best man in the quarter mile, but
Hollywood will have the strongest rep
resentative in this event in Coverley,
who goes around in .51 :3. In the mile
stiff competition will be furnished the
freshmen by Measelles of Hollywood
and Niersbach of Polytechnic. Terry of
Hollywood may take the broad jump if
he hits his record of 22 feet, as there
are no strong yearling competitors.
Freshman track prospects indicate,
from present showings, that the year
lings have an excellent chance of taking
a string of first places in the coming
season's meets. Last night, with the
track dried out and scraped for the first
time in several weeks, a number of good
times were made, especially in the quar
ter mile by those trying for places on the
Irish Marathon team. Twelve men
have already shown to advantage in
their events, from records made in the
