# FOUR WOMEN'S CLASS BASKETBALL TEAMS TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Four women's class basketball teams
will meet four corresponding teams at
California March 11. The announce
ment was made last evening at a meeting
of the Women's Athletic Association in
the Women's Clubhouse.
This move was made in reply to a
query sent a few days ago by the Ath
letic Association at California as to the
advisability of a meet including four
classes instead of two representing
upperclass and underclass women.
It has been the custom in women's
hockey competitions as well as for the
basketball series to have only two teams
enter from each institution. The Asso
ciation believes that the change will
stimulate interest on the part of every
class team in games throughout the sea
son. The system of elimination for in
tercollegiate competitions will be discon
tinued. Interclass rivalry will neverthe
less not be lessened as all teams will
compete for the class championship as
usual.
W. A. A. has been notified that Mills
College will be unable to meet Stanford
March 4, due to participation of members
of the Mills basketball teams in the Mills
Endowment Pageant on that date.
