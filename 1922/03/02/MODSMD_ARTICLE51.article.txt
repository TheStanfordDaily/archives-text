# CARDINAL PUGILISTS AND WRESTLERS TO COMPETE IN ELIMINATION TOURNEY
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's wrestling pro
teges are all set fur the elimination
matches which will take place Saturday
night at 8 o'clock at the Encina gym
nasium. The wrestling exhibition will
precede the boxing eliminations.
The results of this contest will de
termine the six men who will make the
trip to Los Angeles to meet the U. S. C.
matmen during Easter vacation.
Fleming, who was to have met F.
Sturm in the 125-pound class, is out be
cause of sickness, and will be succeeded
by R. Burnett. Both Sturm and Burnett
have had several years' experience, and
because of this the match should prove
a fast one. The real interest is being
manifested in the contest between
Vaughn Hosepian and "Bevo" Bailard,
135-pounders, for neither of them has
been thrown by his teammates of the
same weight, and both won their matches
against the Bruins last year.
The other bout which bids fair to at
tract considerable attention is the one
between the 158-pounders, Boyle and
Nave. Both the men are husky indi
viduals and are evenly matched.
The following bouts are scheduled:
125-pound class. Bob Burnett vs. Franz
Sturm; 135-pound, Vaughn Hosepian vs.
"Bevo" Bailard; 145-pound, Andy Mer
cer vs. D. G. Montgomery; 158-pound,
Robert Boyle vs. "Husky" Nave; 175-
pound, Marcus Leh vs. Norman McKee.
Q. W. Marcus of Palo Alto will
referee the bouts, which will last seven
minutes. If no fall is reached within
the time allotted, the referee will render
a decision. Student body cards will ad
mit all students. The general public will
be charged 50 cents.

Plenty of action is promised the box
ing fan who attends the elimination bouts
in the Encina gymnasium Saturday night.
In these matches, the two best men in
each class will face each other to deter
mine who will represent the Cardinal
against the Blue and Gold March 11.
In the 125-pound class, Kal Sapero will
be pitted against Kenny Shipp. Sapero
is a veteran from last years' squad.
Shipp, in spite of the fact that he is a
newcomer, is showing a great deal of
class. Hf 1 is fast, packs a wicked punch
in either mitt, and is always willing to
mix things with the best of them.
Jack Fishburn and Mike Hodges will
decide the best man in the 135-pound
class in a battle which should be any
thing but an afternoon tea. Hodges is
a veteran and Fishburn is a new man
who has come to the front during the
paSt few weeks.
Bill Burkhard and Walter Bills, 145-
pounders, will tangle in what should
prove out of the hardest fought bouts of
the evening. Burkhard and Bills are
both veterans from last year. Burkhard
holds a win over a California man and
Bills won his bout against the University
of Southern California. Both are in
prime condition and going at top speed.
Jim Arthur and Floyd Tull are the
boys upon whom the Cardinal chances
depend in the heavyweight class. Arthur
is a tough opponent for any man, as
those who saw him battle last year will
testify, and they say that this big boy
Tull is no novice. He is a member of
the tire squad on the campus and strange
tales of his doings with the mitts drift
from the fire house.
The feature bout of the evening will
come in the light-heavy class. "Husky"
Wassum and Mark Evans, old-time
rivals, will cross mitts and attempt to
even up the old score.. The winner of
this bout will face California's "Grand
Old Man of the Boxing Game," Jimmie
Cline.
In the preliminaries, Jake Trwin and
Johnnie Lane will furnish the curtain
raiser.
The matches will be held in the old
gymnasium and adequate bleachers will
be provided. Phil N'oonan, boxing com
missioner of the Olympic Club, will
referee the bouts, Foed Free and "Dink"'
Templeton will act as judges, and "Fat"
Osrander will be official announcer. The
bouts will be three-round affairs.
