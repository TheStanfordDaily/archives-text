### 
YAP TREATY IS ADOPTED
The Senate yesterday adopted the
Yap treaty without reservations. The
final vote was 67 to 22. The Demo
crats voted with little regard for
party lines, thirteen in a total of
thirty-two deciding for the treaty.
Only three Republicans voted against
the treaty.
The Democrats offered several re
servations but all of them were de
feated. One reservation was designed
to safeguard further the American
radio rights on the island. The treaty
provides that "no American plant is
to be installed there as long as Japan
maintains one 'adequate' to meet the
situation." Senator Lodge and Under
wood opposed the reservation offered
011 the ground "that under the treaty
itself this government would judge
exclusively in any controversy over
efficiency of the service rendered."
The four power Pacific treaty is to
be considered next. Yesterday's dis
cussion on reservations is simply a
prelude to the more intense one that
will be fought over the four power
pact. In view of the coming Con
gressional elections, party lines will
undoubtedly play a stronger part in
the vote of this treaty than they did
on the Yap agreement.
Premier Lloyd George is once more
trying to worry England with one of
his resignation threats. The last of
the threats has been made only to
Austin Chamberlain and few other
Unionist leaders as yet. It is not in
tended to involve the entire cabinet,
but only the retirement of the pre
mier personally.
Sir George Younger, a leader of the
Tory "die hards," engineered a revolt
against the premier when the latter
was at Cannes recently. Now the
premier contends that either Sir
George or himself must go.
It seems that an election can not
be staved off much longer.
The premier might resign and Austin
Chamberlain be given the work of
forming a new government. However,
the geiy»ral opinion seems to be that
the country would not support a Union
ist government for very long. British
politics have long been stagnant but
there are signs of actice developments
soon.
