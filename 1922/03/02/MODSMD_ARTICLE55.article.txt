# ALFRED MASTERS IS ELECTED CAPTAIN OF SOCCER ELEVEN
## 
### 
At present the Cardinal varsity soccer
squad leads the University and Club
League, but owing to the fact that the
Cards lost a game to the Palo Alto
American Legion two weeks ago, the
soccerites can be tied for iirst honors by
the Olympic Club in case the Winged-O
men can stow away the three games that
they have yet to play.
The Stanford team has one game yet
to be played, but it is with one of the
weakest teams in the league, and Coach
[ Maloney's men ought to have little
trouble in snowing their rivals under.
On the other hand, the Olympics have a
hard game with the Barbarians. The
Barbs have been showing more class of
late, and it would not be surprising it'
they got the better of the clubmen.
In case there is a tie in the league,
Stanford will meet the Olympic Club in
a third game to decide the championship.
This game will also decide to what team
the club cup and individual medals
will go.
By defeating the varsity, Fremont j
I Post No. 52 nosed out the California j
j varsity for third place. The Legion (
; team is a remarkable aggregation, and â€¢
j could the players have practiced together I
; a little more the soldiers would have;
doubtless been contesting seriously the!
leadership of the league.
La,st night Alfred Masters, '23, was |
elected skipper of the next year's var- j
sity. Masters plays goal for the Cardi
nal, having held down that position both j
On his freshman team and for the last j
i two seasons on the varsity. He is aj
member of Encina Club.
The prospects for a strong team are
! good for the coming year. While the j
| varsity loses Captain Hill Gorman.
George Clark, Jerr Robinson, and Mike j
i Mendonca, a nucleus still remains as
| more than a good starter.
