# STANFORD DEBATERS UPHOLD NEGATIVE IN SEATTLE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's debating team, composed
of Bertrand 'Comparet, '24, and Leland
Stanford, '24, which will take the nega
tive side of the question, will meet the
University of Washington team at
Seattle tonight in the first of the Tri-
State debates. Two years ago Washing
ton won this contest, while last year the
decision of the judges was in favor of
R. C. Binkley and Vernon Green of
Stanford. This year's contest will break
the tie between the two universities.
The debate tonight is important from
another point of view. If Stanford wins
tonight, the debate here tomorrow night
at 8 o'clock in the Assembly Hall will
be for the championship of the Pacific
Coast Debating League. Last year the
championship race resulted in a three
cornered tie for first place. Each of the
teams won its affirmative and lost its
negative debate on the subject, "Re
solved, that Congress Should Enact a
Law Prohibiting Strikes in Essential 'In
dustries (Constitutionality Granted)."
