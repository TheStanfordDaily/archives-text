# FRESHMAN DIAMOND SQUAD OVERWHELMS SAN MATEO. 21 TO 5
## 
### 
Complete annihilation was the lot of j
the San Mateo High School nine, which
went down before the Freshman attack
yesterday afternoon by a score of 21 tc> j
5. The lads from up the* highway were j
unable to reach Follansbee, the 19251
moundsman, with any regularity, and
their own erratic ball playing allowed
the Babe., to retain a safe lead at all j
stages.
The Freshmen wielded the willow j
with vengeance, and sampled the offer
ings of live different twirlers, finding
them good for sixteen hits. Dick Law
son and Cuddeback had the same record
of two doubles and a single. Johnston
celebrated in the fifth with a trip around
the bags, and Roberts drove out a triple
besides making two singles. McCand
less and Connor shared honors with a
double and single apiece.
Follansbee pitched the entire game,
and the receiving was done by Connor,
Johnston taking his place in center field.
Follansbee allowed six hits, two of l
which were doubles. Ihe game was j
called in the seventh inning.
The 'jbig sixth" was the riot of the]
game, and the Freshmen batted around.
Singles b\ Cuddeback, Lawson, Connor, |
and Roberts, with doubles by McCand- !
less, Lawson, and Cuddeback, combined
with walks, wild pitches, and plenty of
errors, enabled the first-year men to;
romp around the bases ten times. Half
of the total number of hits were made in
this batting spree.
The Freshmen started off with a rush,
with three tallies in the first frame on |
Lawson's single over second, Cudde •
back's double, and Johnston's single,
aided by two errors. The prep boys j
were held safely in the first, but in the
sccond round they put over two counts
on a pair of singles, a double, and an
error. A hit batsman, two stolen liases
and a bingle brought them another point
in the next inning, and two doubles had
the same result in the fourth. In the j
sixth frame, with two away, the San
Mateo batsmen added one more run.
Saturday the freshmen will play the
Oakland Technical High School. The
time has not been set for this game,
but it will take place on the fresh
man diamond. Soay has not selected
his slabsters so far, but he will prob- <
ably pick from Aydelott. Solomon, j
Teague, or Howard.

Complete annihilation was the lot of j
the San Mateo High School nine, which
went down before the Freshman attack
yesterday afternoon by a score of 21 tc> j
5. The lads from up the* highway were j
unable to reach Follansbee, the 19251
moundsman, with any regularity, and
their own erratic ball playing allowed
the Babe., to retain a safe lead at all j
stages.
The Freshmen wielded the willow j
with vengeance, and sampled the offer
ings of live different twirlers, finding
them good for sixteen hits. Dick Law
son and Cuddeback had the same record
of two doubles and a single. Johnston
celebrated in the fifth with a trip around
the bags, and Roberts drove out a triple
besides making two singles. McCand
less and Connor shared honors with a
double and single apiece.
Follansbee pitched the entire game,
and the receiving was done by Connor,
Johnston taking his place in center field.
Follansbee allowed six hits, two of l
which were doubles. Ihe game was j
called in the seventh inning.
The 'jbig sixth" was the riot of the]
game, and the Freshmen batted around.
Singles b\ Cuddeback, Lawson, Connor, |
and Roberts, with doubles by McCand- !
less, Lawson, and Cuddeback, combined
with walks, wild pitches, and plenty of
errors, enabled the first-year men to;
romp around the bases ten times. Half
of the total number of hits were made in
this batting spree.
The Freshmen started off with a rush,
with three tallies in the first frame on |
Lawson's single over second, Cudde •
back's double, and Johnston's single,
aided by two errors. The prep boys j
were held safely in the first, but in the
sccond round they put over two counts
on a pair of singles, a double, and an
error. A hit batsman, two stolen liases
and a bingle brought them another point
in the next inning, and two doubles had
the same result in the fourth. In the j
sixth frame, with two away, the San
Mateo batsmen added one more run.
Saturday the freshmen will play the
Oakland Technical High School. The
time has not been set for this game,
but it will take place on the fresh
man diamond. Soay has not selected
his slabsters so far, but he will prob- <
ably pick from Aydelott. Solomon, j
Teague, or Howard.
