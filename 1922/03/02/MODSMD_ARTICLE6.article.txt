# FACULTY MEMBERS WILL SUBSCRIBE TO ENDOWMENT AS UNIT
## 
### 
1 lie faculty will contribute to the en
dowment fund as a separate unit, so as
to avoid the possibility of many of the
faculty pledges being made through
alumni efforts, and thus reducing the
visible amount contributed by faculty
members. This announcement was made
public today by the committee in charge,
Professors S. S. Seward, J. O. Snyder,
and C. B. Whittier, and was the result
of a resolution adopted at a faculty
meeting last Friday. The resolution, a
copy of which has been sent to* every
member of the teaching staff, is as fol
lows :
"In appreciation of the loyal response
to the imperative need of a larger en j
dowment which is being made t the
university's appeal by its alumni and stu- j
dents and friends, the faculty welcomes |
the opportunity of participating as a c<> '
operating unit in advancing the welfare!
of the university through the endowment!
fund campaign which is now in prog- j
ress."
The chief reasons presented for this j
resolution were: The possibility that |
unless such action were taken, many fac- j
ulty contributions would he made as j
alumni pledges, leaving the amount a|>-j
parentlv contributed by tlie faculty much j
less than the actual figures; the fact that j
in all similar campaigns so far as known
to us, faculty contributions have been
made as a unit: and the fact that repre
sentative alumni who had been inform
ally consulted were of the unanimous
opinion that united faculty participation
would be not only appropriate and, in
the larger aspects of the matter, logical,
but also helpfully effective in making
the campaign a success.
It was suggested that a committee of
the faculty should he appointed to so
licit subscriptions. The proposal was J
repudiated as undesirable and inconsist-
