Dr. Jordan has given a personal sketch
of his friend:
"In person Dr. Branner was robust
and vigorous, six feet in height and well
proportioned, a man of attractive per
sonality and excellent address. In col
lege he was noted for his dry humor and
unfailing readiness and good nature. As
a teacher, he was singularly successful
in training and accurate dealing with
problems of Geology and Mining, gain
ing the personal love and confidence of
his students. Among his disciples are
many of high standing in tiie profession.
"1 may add a personal word. 1 have
known Dr. Branner well for fifty-two
years, the first two as a fellow student
and fraternity brother in Delta Upsilon;
the next thirty as a fellow teacher and
worker in science in Indiana and Cali
fornia; the next three as my successor
and colleague in administration of the
educational work to which I gave the
best twenty-five years of my life; and
finally in five years of retirement. In all
these years he has lived up to his motto
of forty years ago, 'I can get along with
out the respect of my neighbors, but not
without the respect of number one,' and
in his lifelong support of his own self
respect he has won the regard of bis
neighbors of whatever degree. From no
one of these have I ever heard an un
kind word.
"Living a righteous life helps to
strengthen all who come into contact
with it. There is always room for a
man of force and he makes room for
many others."
