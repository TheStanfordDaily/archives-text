# ST. MARY'S NINE PLAYS CARDINAL HERE TOMORROW
## Seay's Men Have Low Batting Average For Games Played, Fielding Department Good 
### 
Going up against their first college op
ponents of the season, the varsity nine
will clash with the horsehide tossers
from St. Mary's tomorrow afternoon 011
the varsity diamond.
The tide of fortune lias been running
against Seay's men lately, as they have
lost the last four games. The trouble
so far seems to lie in the lack of hitting
power. The pitching has been good
enough to win most early season games,
but tlie batters have not been coming
through with the necessary bingles at
the proper moments. The batting av
erage of the whole team for the last
four games has been .138, which is not
strong enough to win many games, even
with the best of pitching. This is partly
due, of course, to the high-class pitchers
that the men have been up against, and
as the season goes on, batting eyes
should gain in sharpness.
Seay has bought a new batch of bats
for the team, and, if the slugging picks
up in the near future, some victories
should come rolling in. Not much is
known about the St. Mary's nine that
will show up tomorrow, but the Car
dinal hitters are anxious to straighten
out a few of the tricky ones the Saint's
hurler has in stock.
The infield lineup lias been changed
but little in the last few weeks. Hecken
dorff has played consistantly at third
base, but Smurr, of last year's freshman
nine, is making a hard bid for the posi
tion. Maillot and Woodward have been
alternating at short, but when Wood
ward does not get a chance in the in
field, he usually guards the outer gar
dens. as he is always a dangerous man
with the bat.
Peavy has been displaying Mitchell at
second in most of the games so far,
Who will finally fill the job regularly is
still in doubt, but from present appear
ances last year's second-sacker will have
to show a lot of stuff to keep his job
away from Peavy. At first base Pat
terson looms up as the man for the po
sition, and is showing his last year's
ability to field and hit.
The game with the Olympic Club
scheduled for last Saturday, was called
off, along with 'some of the other ath
letic events for the day, on account of
the rain.
