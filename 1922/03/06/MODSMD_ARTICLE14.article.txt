# VARSITY BOXERS PICKED FOR BLUE AND GOLD BOOTS
## Large Crowd Witnesses Fast Matches as Pugilists Meet in Elimination Tournament 
### D.E. Liebendorfer, '24 
Shades of Jack Denipsey! It is 'im
probable that any crowd ever got more
thrills out of a world's championship
match than the cash customer* got out
of the elimination bouts in Encina Gym
nasium Saturday night. And right here
we may say that one of the largest and
most enthusiastic crowds that ever wit
nessed a boxing tournament on the
campus turned out for the matches.
I larry Maloney expressed it well .when
he said before the bouts, "Boxing is be
ing put on a high plane among inter
collegiate sports, a position which it de
served." The bouts without exception
were fast and hard fought.
The first bout of the evening, an ex
hibition match between Jake Irwin and
Johnnie Lane, showed both men at their
best. The first two rounds were any
body's, both men landing hard blows.
Lane's right was finding its mark re
peatedly on Irwin's body and head, and
Irwin was countering with lefts and
rights to the head. Lane had the first
by a shade and the second was about
even, luit Irwin came back in sensa
tional style in the final round and earned
a draw decision, which was well re r
ceived by the fans.
Jimmie Ross and Jack Fishburn in
the 135-pound class were matched in
the fastest bout of the evening. Both
fighters started at the sound of the
gong and fast pace never slackened dar
ing the entire three rounds. Fishburn,
although plainly outclassed, put up an
excellent fight and forced Jimmie to ex
tend himself to win the decision. Ross
had his opponent groggy in the first
round, driving him to the ropes time
and again with a shower of rights and
lefts. In the second, Ross again pressed
the light. His uppercut was working in
ureat style. Fishburn made a wonder
ful show of gameness in the final round
and some furious milling and toe to toe
fighting resulted. The bout ended with
Re-- leading blows almost at will, and
he was given the decision.
Kenny Shipp, the boy with the wicked
right, won his match from Kal Sapero
by a shade. He was only able to win by
a sensational spurt in the third round.
The first round started with an even
exchange of blows. Shipp's right was
not finding its mark. As the round
progressed, however, he seemed to re
cover and his blows began to tell. The
second round was a repitition of the
first, with an even exchange of hard
bloWs at close range. In the final round
Shipp forged ahead and Sapero was
groggy when the final gong sounded.
The closest and hardest fought match
of the evening went an extra round be
fore Bill Burkhard won a decision from
Walter Bills. Both men were'wary dur
ing the first round, feeling each other
out. Burkhard's right to the heard and
left to the body won him the edge in
this frame. The second round found
Burkhard on the defensive. A furious
exchange of blows with no marked ad
vantage for either man ended the round.
The third round was again even and
the men went an extra round. In the
fourth, Burkhard started swinging wild
ly, but managed to pile up enough of a
lead to earn him the decision.
Mark Evans and Husky Wassum, light
heavies, boxed an exhibition match with
no decision given. Both men were will
ing mixers and the bout was a good one.
Wassum, through superior footwork and
condition, seemed to have the edge.
Any of the fans present who had ever
wondered what would happen if two
pile-drivers came together had their
curiosity satisfied when Floyd Tull and
Jim Arthur mixed. Their little argu
ment was anything but an afternoon tea.
From the first to the last gong it was
plain that both men were there with
malice aforethought. Annihilation would
have been the fate of either had there
been any tendency to slow up. A furi
ous exchange of blows at close range
with blood spilled frequently resulted in
a bout which was of real "main event"
merit. The men were so evenly matched
that the decision could have been in
favor of either or could have been a
draw without being far wrong. Arthur
was finally given the decision.
Jimmie Britt, former world light
weight champion, was introduced to the
fans by Harry Maloney. Britt is re
membered by the tight fans as one of
the best men who ever wore the padded
mitts in his class, and it is possible that
he will coach the Cardinal pugilists in
the near future. Britt expressed himself
as highly pleased with the work of
Coach Malonev's men. W. J. Larue,
former amateur heavyweight champion
of the world, refereed the exhibition
match between Irwin and Lane. Phil
Noonan of the Olympic Club refereed
the main bouts of the evening, and Dink
Templeton and Frank I" relie acted as
judges.
