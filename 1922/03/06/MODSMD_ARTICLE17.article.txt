# FOSTERING NATIVE ABILITY.
## 
### 
Dramatic Council, which has come to stand for
marked progress in the quality of Stanford stage
work, is now offering fifty dollars for the best one
act play submitted by a Stanford student.
Heretofore the only opportunity which campus
play rights have had for testing their .skill on the
campus stage has been in the form of musical com
edy for the Junior Opera and the Ram's Head Show.
Now comes a chance for native dramatic creative
ability of any nature, with only a few minor limita
tions. There is no doubt that such ability exists
and the campus will see and judge the result next
quarter.
Although from the outset the council has been
essentially a business organization, it has shown a
spirit in all its undertakings which is placing Stan
ford in an. enviable position as a center for college
dramatics of the higher order. This is only another
step in the policy of making every element of campus
theatricals the product of local talent and effort.
