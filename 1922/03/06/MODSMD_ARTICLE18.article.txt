With the opening of the season of sunshine
thoughts turn to the sports that come in this season.
The national pastime, so called, of the Americans
enters to take up our interest and we yearn to spend
our afternoons down on the ball diamond with the
gray-clad players knocking the baseball around the
field, and running bases. Or perhaps the track ap
peals with the entrance of warm weather and we
would rather get out and don a suit of old wollens
and work off a little of the padding that inactivity
*>112 winter has put upon us.
This desire to be out of the confining room of
constant study is good because here is healthy relax
ation from the strain upon the brain and eyes, and
bodily exercise which puts the whole physical self
in trim to better absorb the things which are to be
impressed by way of the eye or ear upon the mind.
The fatigue which comes from a reasonable amount
â€¢of physical effort makes a sleep which is healthy
and builds up the system when the exhaustion re
sulting from too concentrated effort upon the books
makes a nervous condition in the body which sleep
will not undo. Our classroom work with its prepara
tion necessitates a good deal of inside work if the
study is to be done justice, and a brief work out in
one of the lines of athletics which the physical edu
cation department supplies is the best means of al
laying that strained feeling of weariness.
