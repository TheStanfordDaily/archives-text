# LESS SCANDAL NEWS.
## 
### 
Speaking before Sigma Delta Chi Thursday even
ing, Professor Tatlock commented on the marked
difference between the European Continental press
and the American papers in the handling of what
we term scandal news. He cited the case of the
Arbuckle trial. In our local papers each day's hap
penings occupied a whole page with a string of
signed stories and purported news stories on all the
ins and outs of the case. At the time, being in Paris,
Professor Tatlock was able to see the interest taken
in the matter there. Le Matin and the other large
papers of the city ran short items in the columns of
their paper which were condensed to less than the
accounts in the press wires.
The difference between the Continental dailies and
ours is largely that the papers there contain much
more of a literary style of writing than the straight
news which is the greatest part of our makeup.
Items from all over the world occupy a more prom
inent place in their sheets than in ours, so that the
average reader is kept better informed about world
wide conditions than the person here, who is forced
to cull the whole paper to find many items of interest

outside of his own vicinity.
A good many dailies in this country are trying to
get away from the purely local style of news pub
lication and are making more of a feature of the
nation and world-wide happenings. It is true that
public interest is not educated to that type of pub
lication in America as yet. but steps are being taken
every day to make the goal nearer to realization. It
is not too much to hope that within a comparatively
few years we will see the time when the stories of
crime and scandal which fill so much of the average
paper will be supplanted by a greater amount of
news taken from the events all over the world that
are of universal appeal and benefit to all.
