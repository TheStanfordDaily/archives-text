### 
The greatest surprise of the intra
mural basketball season came off on
Thursday night, when Theta Chi hung
a defeat on Alpha Delta Phi, 11 to 8,
in a close game packed full of thrills.
The latter quintet, which has been a
permanent fixture in the ranks of the
winners, was conceded an easy victory.
This is the first contest Alpha Delta
Fhi has lost during the year. Alpha
Kappa Lambda came out three points
to the good in a fast and furious court
bout with Delta Upsilon, the final score
being S to 5.
Theta Chi started strong and kept
up the pace to the finish, retaining
(he lead thruoghout the game. It
seemed that every time Alpha Delta
Phi men started a fresh drive, their
opponents would celebrate with a field
goal.
Both aggregations showed excellent
defensive work which kept down the
score, regardless of two pairs of ac
curate forwards.
The second half began with Theta
Chi leading at 5 to 2, but a basket
by Phil Neer, after a fast exchange
of plays, reduced this advantage to
one point. Theta Chi made a quick
comeback. Smith took the ball off the
backstop, when a free throw failed,
and dropped it through the hoop.
Schultzberg followed a half minute
later with a field goal which made the
score 9-4. Neer checked this attack
somewhat by finding the basket on a
long side shot. The last score for
Theta Chi was made by Bogle, star
forward, who delighted in bouncing
the ball all around the ring.
In the last few minutes, the Alpha
Delt five unloosened an attack which
threatened to snatch victory from the
Theta Chi players. Dennis looped in
