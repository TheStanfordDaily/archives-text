Phil Newill, Wednesday Engineer

Henry Mack, In Friday Caboose
We wish Wideman's would stage a Wednesday sale
for Cabbages some day, so that rolling in wealth would
be a term that really meant something.

'Twenty-four, attention! Buy from the right! If
that sale the day after tomorrow at Wideman's nets as
much money for the class as prophets predict, assess
ments will be as necessary as a fur coat on the Red Sea.

Scene: W 'm Clothing Store, on University Ave.

They enter the store, pick up three exhausted clerks
and pile them in the machine).
First Stretcher-bearer: What's the matter? Played
out?
Second Stretcher-bearer: Naw —sold out.

Still Another Viewpoint
Dear Sir: I think that idea of Wideman's of donat
ing the cash from Wednesday's sales to the soph class
is a good one, but why, I ask, let it stop there? I have
three blind aunts and a German cousin to support back
in France, and I wouldn't mind getting Friday's sales
for myself. I could give a lot of advertising in re
turn, as my step-brother is barker at the side-show, and
he could slip in a few side remarks now and then.
Then my friend, who is working several people on his
way through college, can be given Sunday's net pro
ceeds. I am writing to you because every store in
town has refused me my offer so far. Y'rs tr'ly,
PIERRE LA SPONGE.

Clipping from the Haytown, Mo., Gazette, March 10,
1922:
* * *
Word has just been received of the gallant conduct
of Josiah H. Jonathan, '25, who saved the lives of several
onlookers during a big rush that took place on a cloth
ing store in Palo Alto, Wednesday. The crowd had
massed ten deep along the outside, when Josiah noticed
a penny lying on the outskirts. He made a heroic dive
for it, but an aged man who happened to be on the
spot put his foot on the coin and got it first. Josiah
whipped out his gun and would have fired at random,
but he got a firm grip on his temper and refrained from
action, thus saving the lives of many of the onlookers.
He was awarded a nickle-plated pencil clip by the
grateful citizens of the town.

The Statistics Hound has it all figured out that if
enough goods are bought at Wideman's this Wednesday,
the amount gained by the sophomore class in dollars
and cents would, if stretched out lengthwise, reach from
here to Black Mt. and back four and a half times.

After the Wednesday Buying Panic
Chief of Motor Cops Reed: "I never saw such fast
action since I chased that 1922 Duesenberg."
Mayor Cathcart: "It gave me a great insight on
revenue raising. Down with taxes!"
Cinnamon T. Slade: "Our next door location was
worth a million to us. I always knew I'd be lucky some
day."
Fire Chief Lamb: "I thought it was a fire sale, so T
didn't call the engines out. I used to be twenty-four
myself."

MANUSCRIPT FOUND IN THE DESK OF A PRO
FESSOR, AFTER HE HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE.
"I have always tried to do the right thing by, or
nearby, the students. •
"I have never given long assignments over holidays.
"I have never wasted hours thinking up trick-examina
tion questions. , 1 12;
"I have never let five different instructors grade on
five different bases.
"I have never made a special effort to include dry
material in every day's lecture.
"Therefore, the only position open to me is a deaf
and dumb professorship in an insane asylum. Here
goes!" LUKE.

PROFESSOR SMOKES IN CLASSROOM!
SCANDAL RAMPANT AT BOLOGNA!!!!!
Bologna College, Bologna, Ariz., Jan 2. (C.I.N.S.) —
President Rufus D. Gufus was found smoking in his
