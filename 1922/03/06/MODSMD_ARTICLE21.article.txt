# LOWELL HIGH LOSES TO CARDINAL BABES IN SWIMMING MEET
## 
### 
Lowell High proved to be an easy vic
tim for the freshman water paddlers
when the San Francisco boys were
swamped by a score of 55 to 13 Saturday
morning in Encina pool. Coach Hrand
sten used all the swimmers that he will
send against the Blue and Gold babes
next Saturday in the annual meet. He
was well pleased by the showing the
freshmen made in the meet Saturday.
The Card swimmers started the morn-'
ing off with a bang by capturing all
places in the diving competition. Straube,
Gibbons, and Muir should be able to
offer the California cubs a strong
battle for honors. Another clean
sweep of all places was registered in
the 50-yard free style, when Klebahn
broke the tape and was followed by
Meyers and Peters.
Hobdy of Lowell showed his heels
to his Cardinal opponents in the 50-
yard back-stroke, and earned five
[ points for the Bay City school. Sulli
van was inspired by the achievement
of his team mate and navigated the
100-yards in free style faster than the
Babes, thus winning another first
place.
Rosenbaum and Chittendon showed
too much skill for Felton, the Lowell
plunging star, and forced him to be
content with third place.
Coach Brandsten will hold races
every afternoon of this week to get
his first-year squad in the best pos
sible condition for their struggle
against California. From the show
ing that the Babes have made in dual
meets during the last two months
Coach Brandsten has developed one
of the fastest first-year teams that
has represented Stanford for several
years. The team is not particularly
I strong in any certain events but is
a well-balanced team.
