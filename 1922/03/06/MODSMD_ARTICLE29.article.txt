G. U. Society of St. Mary's, in the
semi-finals of the intersociety league
debate held in the Little Theatre, Sat
'irday evening, on the question: "Re
solved, That the United States forces
should evacuate Haiti." This victory
gives Euphronia the right to meet
Senate of California, for the title of
the league.
The decision was made 60 per cent
on subject matter, 30 per cent on
delivery, and 10 per cent on compo
sition. The judges were E. D. Lakin,
('. C. Thouits, and W. H. Kelley, all
of Palo Alto. Herbert Alexander, '22,
presided. Ten-minute speeches were
made, with a four-minute rebuttal for
each.
B. W. Levit, '24, the first speaker for
the affiirmative, .told of the distrust of
the natives which had culminated in
a revolt. J. A. Lawler, initial negative
debater, argued that Haitians were un
civilized, and illiterate, and as such
are not a people capable of governing
themselves.
Matliew Tobriner, '24, the second
' Euphronia speaker, told of the treaty
I made by the United States with Haiti
; after the Marines had landed on the
j island, which was forced by military
power. This, treaty was immediately
: broken by the United States, Tobriner
! pointed out, by the refusal to evacuate
the island as agreed u the treaty was
signed, and by failure to properly carry
out three provisions of the treaty,
which assured finance reforms, a gen
darmerie to be officered by Americans
and competent Haitians, and which
gave a guarantee of legal inde
pendence.
M. J. Dooley, in the second speech
for the negative declared that Haiti
was not a self-supporting, functioning
republic when the United States en
tered in 1915, Slid that the landing of
French troops, when the French
Consulate was violated, forced the
United States to enter to preserve the
Monroe Doctrine.
R. C. Binkley, '22, gave the affirma
tive's final argument. Binkley made
the statement that, the United States
is not in duty bound to take over
every country which has an unstable
government. He pointed out that the
issue was something more than main
taining troops in Haiti, as commercial
I interests and the attitude of South
! America, which was being affected un
j favorably by the action of the United
! Siates, far outweighed the benefits
| of even a good government in Hai\i,
i which was not at present being estab
lished by the Marines. In reply to
j this, A. T. Duffy, the final negative
I speaker, cited the increase in com
; merce since Americans have entered
! Haiti, the sanitation reforms, the
peaceful and law-abiding character of
; the island at present, and the increase
I in educational facilities.
