# THIRTY BLOCK PRINTS OF TWO CALIFORNIAN ARTISTS ON EXHIBIT
## 
### 
Two California artists of high dis-1
tinction in their line of work, will have |
an exhibition in the Stanford Memorial
Art Gallery, during the next two
weeks, beginning Sunday.
William S. Rice, nead of the Art De-1
partment of the Fremont High School
in Oakland, has a group of thirty color :
ful block prints, portraying largely;
Cul.'lc* I'.'ii scenes, with a few from
Pennsylvania and Europe. The de-j
signs are beautifully composed and,
show a skillful color interpretation.
Rice has developed this art to the
extent that he has become one of
the leading block printers in America.
The line etchings in black and j
white are exhibited by John Winkler, j
a San Francisco man, and are among j
the best of his collection. The scenes, i
like those on the block prints, are'
mainly local and center about San I
Francisco, Oakland and its vicinity. :
The quaint, picturesque sketches of j
Chinatown are among the most inter-j
esting of the etchings. Winkler's ex-;
bibitions in New York and Boston j
were highly praised by critics, and j
lie won the leading honors in the etch
ings annuals held in Chicago recently.!
The line etchings are a direct con-;
tinuation of the type just on display j
by Baroness Gobanz and are*scratched â€¢
on metal.
The block prints differ from the'
etchings in that they are carved on a
block of wood, and have a larger en- j
semble, instead of the delicacy of out
line characterise of th- plain etch- j
ings. No block is ever reproduced a :
second time, therefore each one is
distinctive in itself.
Both of these artists were at one i
time students of Pedro J. Lemos, di-!
rector of the art gallery, and owe
much of their success to his interest i
in their work, Lemos persuading Wink
ler to make a specialty of black and j
white studies.
The Stillman collection of Japanese
prints will continue its exhibit for a j
few days longer in the main exliibi-1
tion room.
