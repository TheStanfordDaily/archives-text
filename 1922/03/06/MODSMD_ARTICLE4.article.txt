Kallam's freshman baseball players
conquered the strongest opposition yet
offered them by handing a 9-4 defeat to
the Oakland Technical High School

P>abes, with the exception of a string
of walks in the sixtli inning. The vis

one run during live frames, greeted joy
fully the base on balls episode, and
scored three tallies, which gave them
the lead at 4-3. Aydclotte allowed live
earned hits and fanned seven batters.
Butler, the opposing slabster. was easily
the best pitcher the freshmen have gone
up against tin's season. However, al

outs, he could not prevent the hard

ten blows, among them a triple by
Johnston and a double by Lawson.

putting over a run. The first man up
drew a base when hit by Aydclotte, and
took second on an infield out. He
scored when Quinn drove the ball into
left field.
Lawson ushered in the yearlings' half
of the inning by sending a two-bagger
into the left garden, advancing to third
when Roberts was safe on a fielder's
choice. An error by the catcher al
lowed Lawson to cross the plate. Rob
erts made the second tally on Cudde
back's bingle to right. Tlic prep twirlcr
closed the inning with three strikeouts
to his credit.
The freshmen held the trans-bay nitre
