# CARDINAL RUGBY MEN DUNCE CALIFORNIA
## Shlaudeman, Lynn, Hazeltine Star in 27-0 Victory Over Blue and Gold Rugby Men 
### Chester M. Dauglas '23 
The Cardinal rugby football team of
fered the spectators a great deal of e.x
citement when it trimmed the California
fifteen by a score of 27 to 0 in the
Stadium Saturday afternoon. The play
ing showed that there is still a great
deal of rugby talent and knowledge of
j the game on the Stanford campus re-
I gardless of the fact that the game lias
been reduced to a first-class minor sport.
The open field running of Bob Schlau
deman was one of the outstanding feat
ures of the contest.
Lynn at halfback and Hazeltine at
I first five-eighths, for Stanford, were in
strumental in starting the back field
i rushes that resulted in a score of seven
j tries and a Cardinal victory. Captain
\\ allace, Wrenn, and Campbell played a
very good brand of rugby. Lefty Rogers
assumed the position of fullback and
showed that he could be relied upon as
a kicker.
Walter at halfback, Paul Mohr at
first live-eighths, and Jerry Villain played
well for the Bears.
Coach Harry Maloney sent in prac
tically a new team in the middle part of
the last half, when the game had been
tucked away as a Cardinal victory.
California started the game with the
kick-off and worked the ball to the
Stanford twenty-yard line. The Card
forwards worked the ball down the field.
The Card team started a back-field rush
with Hazeltine and Kelly making long
runs. Jim Kelly made a short kick over
! the line and Murray fell on it for Stan
ford's first try. Lynn brought the score
to 5-0 by a conversion.
After see-sawing back and forth in
mid-field the Card's backfield began an-
other onslaught to their opponents' goal
line. Schlaudeman received the pig
skin out the back field line and made
the first of his spectacular runs, this
time for about twentv-hve yards. After
a line-out and a scrum on the live-yard
.line, halfback Lynn squirmed through
the scrum and backfield for the second
try. He failed to convert the goal be
cause of the difficult angle.
Immediately on receiving the drop
out kick the Cards worked the ball to
the Bears' fifteen-yard line. The Bears
were putting up a strong defense, but
were unable to stay the attack of the I
red-jersey boys. Benninger seized the j
ball when the California fullback fum- |
bled a punt and made across the chalk- j
line for another touchdown. Lynn con- j
verted from in front of the goal posts,
bringing the score to 13-0. The ball !
journeyed from one end of the field to I
the other until the half ended.
At the opening of the second half i
Coach Davis of California and Coach j
Maloney made several substitutions, j
The Stanford forwards started an ad- j
vance from the California forty-yard I
line which the backfield soon took up. j
Bob Schaudeman. got the ball on a pass j
on the fifteen-yard line and scored.
Lynn did not convert. Villain and Mohr !
had displayed their ability on several
occasions. Taylor replaced Loomis,
Dwight filled Rogers' position, and
Hayes was sent in for Maillet.
The next score came as a result of a
passing rush from mid-field, in which
Parker, who had taken the position of
second five, made a pretty run. Wrenn
received the pigskin and crossed the
line. Schlaudeman tried his skill at
kicking goals and sent the ball between
the posts.
On the next kick-off the California
team worked the ball to Stanford's one
yard line only to have the Cards put up
a wonderful defense which made it im- [
possible for the Bruins to score. This
was California's one chance to score
•The Card backfield opened another
charge, which proved to be the most
spectacular of the game, with Schlaud
man and Hazeltine gaining much ground.
On the Blue and Gold drop-out the Car
dinals started again for the chalkline j
and this time Hazeltine planted the ball
under the goal post with very little op
position hindering him, even though
they tried hard enough. Schlaudeman
failed to convert.
Another backfield charge and a
thirty-yard run through the entire Bear
team by Schlaudeman accounted for the
last try of the game. He failed to con
vert.

\\ allace, Wrenn, and Campbell played a
very good brand of rugby. Lefty Rogers
assumed the position of fullback and
showed that he could be relied upon as
a kicker.
Walter at halfback, Paul Mohr at
first live-eighths, and Jerry Villain played
well for the Bears.
Coach Harry Maloney sent in prac
tically a new team in the middle part of
the last half, when the game had been
tucked away as a Cardinal victory.
California started the game with the
kick-off and worked the ball to the
Stanford twenty-yard line. The Card
forwards worked the ball down the field.
The Card team started a back-field rush
with Hazeltine and Kelly making long
runs. Jim Kelly made a short kick over
! the line and Murray fell on it for Stan
ford's first try. Lynn brought the score
to 5-0 by a conversion.
After see-sawing back and forth in
mid-field the Card's backfield began an-
other onslaught to their opponents' goal
line. Schlaudeman received the pig
skin out the back field line and made
the first of his spectacular runs, this
time for about twentv-hve yards. After
a line-out and a scrum on the live-yard
.line, halfback Lynn squirmed through
the scrum and backfield for the second
try. He failed to convert the goal be
cause of the difficult angle.
Immediately on receiving the drop
out kick the Cards worked the ball to
the Bears' fifteen-yard line. The Bears
were putting up a strong defense, but
were unable to stay the attack of the I
red-jersey boys. Benninger seized the j
ball when the California fullback fum- |
bled a punt and made across the chalk- j
line for another touchdown. Lynn con- j
verted from in front of the goal posts,
bringing the score to 13-0. The ball !
journeyed from one end of the field to I
the other until the half ended.
At the opening of the second half i
Coach Davis of California and Coach j
Maloney made several substitutions, j
The Stanford forwards started an ad- j
vance from the California forty-yard I
line which the backfield soon took up. j
Bob Schaudeman. got the ball on a pass j
on the fifteen-yard line and scored.
Lynn did not convert. Villain and Mohr !
had displayed their ability on several
occasions. Taylor replaced Loomis,
Dwight filled Rogers' position, and
Hayes was sent in for Maillet.
The next score came as a result of a
passing rush from mid-field, in which
Parker, who had taken the position of
second five, made a pretty run. Wrenn
received the pigskin and crossed the
line. Schlaudeman tried his skill at
kicking goals and sent the ball between
the posts.
On the next kick-off the California
team worked the ball to Stanford's one
yard line only to have the Cards put up
a wonderful defense which made it im- [
possible for the Bruins to score. This
was California's one chance to score
•The Card backfield opened another
charge, which proved to be the most
spectacular of the game, with Schlaud
man and Hazeltine gaining much ground.
On the Blue and Gold drop-out the Car
dinals started again for the chalkline j
and this time Hazeltine planted the ball
under the goal post with very little op
position hindering him, even though
they tried hard enough. Schlaudeman
failed to convert.
Another backfield charge and a
thirty-yard run through the entire Bear
team by Schlaudeman accounted for the
last try of the game. He failed to con
vert.

After see-sawing back and forth in
mid-field the Card's backfield began an-
other onslaught to their opponents' goal
line. Schlaudeman received the pig
skin out the back field line and made
the first of his spectacular runs, this
time for about twentv-hve yards. After
a line-out and a scrum on the live-yard
.line, halfback Lynn squirmed through
the scrum and backfield for the second
try. He failed to convert the goal be
cause of the difficult angle.
Immediately on receiving the drop
out kick the Cards worked the ball to
the Bears' fifteen-yard line. The Bears
were putting up a strong defense, but
were unable to stay the attack of the I
red-jersey boys. Benninger seized the j
ball when the California fullback fum- |
bled a punt and made across the chalk- j
line for another touchdown. Lynn con- j
verted from in front of the goal posts,
bringing the score to 13-0. The ball !
journeyed from one end of the field to I
the other until the half ended.
At the opening of the second half i
Coach Davis of California and Coach j
Maloney made several substitutions, j
The Stanford forwards started an ad- j
vance from the California forty-yard I
line which the backfield soon took up. j
Bob Schaudeman. got the ball on a pass j
on the fifteen-yard line and scored.
Lynn did not convert. Villain and Mohr !
had displayed their ability on several
occasions. Taylor replaced Loomis,
Dwight filled Rogers' position, and
Hayes was sent in for Maillet.
The next score came as a result of a
passing rush from mid-field, in which
Parker, who had taken the position of
second five, made a pretty run. Wrenn
received the pigskin and crossed the
line. Schlaudeman tried his skill at
kicking goals and sent the ball between
the posts.
On the next kick-off the California
team worked the ball to Stanford's one
yard line only to have the Cards put up
a wonderful defense which made it im- [
possible for the Bruins to score. This
was California's one chance to score
•The Card backfield opened another
charge, which proved to be the most
spectacular of the game, with Schlaud
man and Hazeltine gaining much ground.
On the Blue and Gold drop-out the Car
dinals started again for the chalkline j
and this time Hazeltine planted the ball
under the goal post with very little op
position hindering him, even though
they tried hard enough. Schlaudeman
failed to convert.
Another backfield charge and a
thirty-yard run through the entire Bear
team by Schlaudeman accounted for the
last try of the game. He failed to con
vert.

The Cardinal rugby football team of
fered the spectators a great deal of e.x
citement when it trimmed the California
fifteen by a score of 27 to 0 in the
Stadium Saturday afternoon. The play
ing showed that there is still a great
deal of rugby talent and knowledge of
j the game on the Stanford campus re-
I gardless of the fact that the game lias
been reduced to a first-class minor sport.
The open field running of Bob Schlau
deman was one of the outstanding feat
ures of the contest.
Lynn at halfback and Hazeltine at
I first five-eighths, for Stanford, were in
strumental in starting the back field
i rushes that resulted in a score of seven
j tries and a Cardinal victory. Captain
\\ allace, Wrenn, and Campbell played a
very good brand of rugby. Lefty Rogers
assumed the position of fullback and
showed that he could be relied upon as
a kicker.
Walter at halfback, Paul Mohr at
first live-eighths, and Jerry Villain played
well for the Bears.
Coach Harry Maloney sent in prac
tically a new team in the middle part of
the last half, when the game had been
tucked away as a Cardinal victory.
California started the game with the
kick-off and worked the ball to the
Stanford twenty-yard line. The Card
forwards worked the ball down the field.
The Card team started a back-field rush
with Hazeltine and Kelly making long
runs. Jim Kelly made a short kick over
! the line and Murray fell on it for Stan
ford's first try. Lynn brought the score
to 5-0 by a conversion.
