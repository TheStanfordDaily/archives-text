# FRESHMAN BASKET TEAM LOSES TO BRUINS, 17-32
## Berkeley Babes Capture Series by Win Friday in Oakland Auditorium 
### 
California's freshman basketball
team captured the third and deciding
game of the annual series with Coach
Seay's Stanford Babes, 32 to 17, Fri
day evening in the Oakland Audi
torium.
But the score does not tell every
thing. It does not say that in the
first five minutes of one of the rough
est games of basketball that any Stan
ford team has played this season,
Harry Shipkey was removed with a
compound fracture of the nose, caused
by a head-on collision with Gooch,
California running guard. It does not
tell of Al- Hooper, still sick with a
touch of influenza, substituting for
Shipkey, and playing until he, too, had
to be removed from the game. And
it makes no mention of Alexander
being removed for a protracted col
lision with Farrar, California forward.
In the second half, with the score
20 to 2 against them, the crippled Babe
team came back with a rush that
swept the Bruins from their feet,
and so surprised them that they failed
to stop the Babe onslaught until the
gun ended the game.
Coach Seay and his squad do not
think much about the first half. They

like to think of that second period,
when the Cards came up from be
hind and outplayed a team that was
already confident that victory was
theirs. Hoffman started the landslide
when he speared an overthrown pass
in center court, and dribbled through
the Bruin guards for the first basket
that Stanford had made during the
entire game.
Hoffman was closely followed by
Steele, who looped a long one through
from the side. Hoffman added an
other to the Babe score. At this point
Shipkey returned to the game with his
broken nose protected with tape, but
he had not played more than three
minutes before a blow in the neck
caused his nose to bleed. He was
removed and Hooper substituted.
Hoffman scored another shot from
center court. Alexander and Farrar
were removed by the referee. Wisely
went in for Hooper.
Steele again broke through the
Bruin defense for a basket, and his
example was followed by Wisely, and
a moment later Driscoll. California
added four points to her score during
this period, two of them being con
