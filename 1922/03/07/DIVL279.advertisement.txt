One team everybody
can make
A FTER the big game, if you don't need a box of voice
lozenges there's something wrong. A hoarse voice is
evidence that you were covering your position on the bleachers.
The harder the game the harder it ought to be to talk
afterwards. Your "Ataboy" and "Line it out" buck up a
fagged nine —and so your shouts give you the right to rejoice
in the victory, because they helped win it.
This spectacle of a grandstand full of men fighting for
their team is one aspect of a very splendid sentiment —
college spirit.
When you show collejfe spirit you are doing a fine thing
for your college, a fine thing for the men around you, but a
finer thing for yourself. You are developing a quality which,
if carried into the business world, will help you to success.
tThe same 6pirit which keeps you cheering through a rainy
afternoon will in after life keep you up all night to put
through a rush job for the boss.
The same spirit which makes you stand by your teams
through thick and thin will find you loyal to your shop or
office, always ready with a shoulder to the wheel —even if it
isn't your own particular wheel —giving suggestion and active
help and a word of good cheer, once again earning your
right to rejoice in the victory.
In businessas in college make it a good, snappy "Yea, team 1"
