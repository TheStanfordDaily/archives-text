# COMMITTEE NAMES CO-AUTHORS OF '23 OPERA PRODUCTION
## Rosemary Drachman, '22, and Tom Kleckner, '19, Will Work on Theme-making 
### 
Rosemary Drachman, '22, and Tom
Kleckner, '19, have been selected to
write the Junior Opera for this year.
Miss Drachman was a co-author of the
1921 Junior Opera and wrote the plot
for the women's Spring Pageant. SJic
is a member of Masquers Society. Theta
Sigma Phi, and English Club. Kleckner
wrote a skit for the Football Show la'st
fall entitled, "Somewhere on Broadway."
He belongs to 'Hammer and Coffin So
ciety, Press Club, Sigma Delta Chi, and
contributes to the Cardinal and Pictorial.'
The authors were chosen by the Junior
Opera Committee, composed of Dean
Ross, chairman; Ivo Copeland, Florence
Pixley, Charles Midgley, Richard Mal
aby, and Fred Hughes.
The plan is to combine, as much as
possible, Miss Drachman's plot and
Klechner's dialogue, which they had
written in the competition. The authors
hope to have this accomplished within
two weks.
The plot concerns a man who is al
ways rescuing people from difficult posi
tions. His fiancee determines to cure
him by doing some rescuing herself. She
is amateurish and becomes so involved
in a series of rescues and counter-rescues
that she has to be rescued herself.
More emphasis is going to be placed
on the plot this year than in former
Junior Operas, though music and (lanc
ing are still to be features.
