"The movement has nothing to do with
politics," says Professor J. Elmore,
"and is receiving support from
members of every political party. It
should appeal to every one who believes,
as we all do, in liberal thought, democ
racy, public welfare and peace through
justice. These ideals are especially as
sociated with Mr. Wilson, who has
given them eloquent expression and la
bored—whether wisely or unwisely one
need not say—to bring them about. For
this reason the fund is established in his
honor and bears his name.
"We have no quota for Stanford. 1 lie
spontaneous response which has come
from people in all parts of the country
• and in all walks of life is really remark
able. We hope that every student who
is able will be represented by some con
tribution. however small."
Contributions may be handed or mailed
to any member of the committees or to
Professor Elmore.
