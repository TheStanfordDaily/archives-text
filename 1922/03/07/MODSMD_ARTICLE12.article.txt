# LADY KATHERINE SAVES VAGABOND POET AT GIBBET
## Dance Before King by Women From Paris Streets Added Third Act of Production 
### 
Violet Andrews, '23, as the Lady
j Katherine and Helen Whitney, '24, as
! Huguette du Hamul both have powerful
dramatic roles in "If I Were King,"
which will be presented tomorrow even
ing in the Assembly Hall by English
| Club.
Their love for Francois Villon, the
vagabond poet and erstwhile grand con
stable of France, runs through the four
j acts. Huguette, an appealingly bold
I woman of the tavern, reaches the height
of her emotional scenes when, in the
third act, glie receives the dagger intend
ed for her lover and dits with his name
ton her lips.
The Lady Katherine's greatest scene
j comes in the fourth act, when she saves
I the life of Villon, who has been forced
! to make his own death sentence his last
| official act.
In the opinion of Coach Gordon Davis,
these two characters are the strongest
women's parts ever brought upon the
campus stage.
An attractive feature which has re
cently been added will lie the rollicking
dance given in the rose garden before
the king by four pretty girls of Paris.
Helen Carmen, '23. Helen Harris, '23,
: Dorothy Marston, '21, and Dorothy
! Gardner, '22, have been selected for the
dance.
The Assembly Hall was a center of
activity yesterday afternoon and even
ing. Stage designers, carpenters, labor
ers. lighting experts, mediaeval warriors,
ladies, royalty, and rogues swarmed over
the stage and hall. There are fifty per
sons in the cast and the technical force

• year.
