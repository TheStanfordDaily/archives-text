# Odd Numbers to Be Played Up in Coming Chaparral

That was no way for a gent to do.
Even if lie did want to be a cowboy, he
didn't need to sleep on the range, espe
cially since he rolled over and turned on
the gas.
Did you ever see an egg who took
sugar on his artichoke, or have a room
mate who insisted on the early morning
shower? Now is the chance, men, to
get even with all the odd oysters who
occasionally slip up on you. The Odd
Number of Chaparral, coming out next
month, will even all old scores against
the more or less twisted pretzels who oc
casionally come up for inspection. Con
tributions slipped to Box 15, Campus,
will be received until six o'clock,
March 22.
