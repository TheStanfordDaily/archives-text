# ERNEST H. BAYNES 10 TELL ANIMALS' PART IN WARFARE
## War Correspondent and Na-turalist Will Give Lecture in Little Theatre Tonight 
### 
Ernest Harold Baynes will speak on
"Our Animal Allies in the World War,"
at 7:30 this evening, in the Little The
atre. Animals took a larger part in
the recent war than they have in any
previous conflict. It was found that
not only were horses, mules and dogs
important, but also that guinea pigs,
canaries and other smaller animals
were extremely useful to the military
forces.
During the war Baynes was in
France as a newspaper correspondent.
On account of this he was able to sen
all phases of the military operations
and obtain first-hand information as
to the part taken by animals. His
lecture will be illustrated by one
hundred slides which are taken from
pictures which he collected while he
was overseas.
For many years Baynes has been
interested in the study of animal life
and especially in the protection of
animals from* cruelties or unnecessary
harms. He was one of the founders
of the American Bison Society, whose
purpose is to prevent the extermina
tion of the buffalo. He is president
of the Bird Club in New England and
has heljied the development of the
Audubon Society. Because of his
work with animals, he was highly
commended by Theodore Roosevelt
and by John Burroughs, the natural
ist.
Baynes has spent much time in
vestigating vivisection laboratories in
Europe and America to discover
whether or not there is any truth in
the rumors of the cruelties which
are done to animals under the name
of experimentation. After several
years of studying the situation, Bay
nes came to the conclusion that there
is much misrepresentation about vivi
section. He will speak on the "Truth
About Vivisection," at the Palo Alto
Community house, tomorrow evening.
