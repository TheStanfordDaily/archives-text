# NEW REPORTERS
## 
### 
Seventeen new members are added to the staff
of the Daily Palo Alto today. After a week of
elimination in which more than fifty men and women
participated the following have made the grade:
Bradley Riter, Milton Drey fuss, Norton Brown,
Cranston Stroup, John Marble, James Muir, Les
ter Langford, Robert Rinn, William Wright, Archie
Steele, William Archer, Mildred Dannenbaum, Mary
Baker, Carol Peterson, Dorothy Muller, Grace Judd,
and Elizabeth Roper.
I he appointment of these people has been made
on a basis of amount of material covered, neatness,
dependability on assignment, and promptness in sub
mitting the material assigned. Exceptional work
has been done by some of the new members, and
they will cause lively competition for beats which
older reporters are covering at present. Promotion
in staff rating will be wholly based on merit of work
in connection with the Daily. Seniority will in no
way affect the comparative standing of the various
members.
1 he seventeen additions to the number of report
ers makes the staff too large for effective handling.
1 hose who have been assigned today will in some
cases have overlapping beats with older members of
the staff. In case the former prove better than those
who are their seniors they will be advanced and the
older ones dropped. Shortly after the.first of next
quarter a reduction of about ten will be made in the
reporters.
