Why doesn't the University fix the road running
out from the Lasuen gates toward Mayfield? This
is an important question to any of us who ride over
the stretch between the stone pillars on Lasuen and
San Jyan Hill. The reason for the University not
fixing the road is that it is not property of the Uni
versity.
Inquiry at the office of the Comptroller reveals
the fact that the stretch from the old bridge over
San Francisquito Creek, in past the stock farm and
through the grounds over to the back door of May
field was exchanged to the county when the Uni
versity was founded for Mayfield Avenue so that
the Quad could be put where it is now. As the
road used to run it came across the creek by Roble
bridge and up past the rear of Sequoia, going right
through what is now the center of the Quad and east
past the back of Encina to the Mayfield city limits.
When the exchange was made it was the understand
ing that the county should keep up the present county
road along with its other county construction. In spite
of the fact that a tremendous body of traffic goes
daily over the county road from the University to
the Menlo-Woodside highway there is very little
work done in maintaining the stretch.
The University keeps up many miles of paved
road through its grounds and does it well. I his
paving is used by autoists who are not coming always
to see the University, and the good road up through
the Stanford grounds is an added attraction and
advertisement to Santa Clara C ounty. It would
seem that the county could find a small amount of
funds somewhere in the budget to finish the connect
ing link to the Menlo-Woodside road when the
University already keeps up the whole length from
the main San Francisco-San Jose Highway to the
back of the Stanford grounds.
