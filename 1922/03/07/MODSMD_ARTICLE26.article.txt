Carl Shoup, Monday Conductor,
Hal Rorke, Tuesday Dispatcher.
Phil Newill, Wednesday Engineer
S. G. Trimble, Thursday Section Boss.
Henry Mack, In Friday Caboose
Even if he is rotten enough to rate
it, we won't give Thursday two holi
days in two weeks, because he's a
dying man (see grad list today), so he
pinch-hits for Tuesday today.

Dear Head of Cabbage:—l have a plea to make to
that great and august body—ye public. Spring is at
hand and that means, for obvious reasons, that it's
going to be mighty hard during the next few months to
study. Therefore I move, Mr. Chairman, that, in the
interest of scholarship, queeners be barred from the
Graduate Study or Seminar Room of the Stanford
Library. I wish to say a few words in support of my
motion. How, in Hulley Heck, can an aspirant for
distinction concentrate in the General or Reserved
Reading Rooms with all the snakes hissing around
their charmers? The sole escape is to nigger heaven.
You clamber up to that place where people who come to
college to cram are to be found. Then, Holy Honey
suckle, those !?*||()@ pigeons start cooing their love
sick strains up in the rafters. Walt Warren says that
they bellow like bulls, which shows how grotesquely
unpoetical an angry man can get. These doves of heaven
are almost as intolerable as the snakes of —well, down
stairs. Anyway, your "dig' will stand for the doves
as the lesser of two evils if the reptiles will only keep
out, as they haven't been lately. If they don't I'll have
to study down in the Cactus Garden.

Funny as the proverbial March Heiress, the women
will edit Chappie this month to prove feminine clever
ness.
Ah, Cliappilita, so this month's your coming-out?
And a party it will be!
And Chappilita, tho we haven't met before,
The Or Girl we shall gladly see.
Chappie, Chappie, Pudding and pie,
Razzes the girls and makes them cry;
When the girls come back to play,
Chappie, Chappie runs away.
So here is to you, Chappilita, at your home down on
the Farm,
You're a mighty saucy girl but you surely got the
charm;
But here'll be to you, Chappilita, with your waterfalling
hair,
You'll be a mighty clever woman if you do 'em up for
fair.

The boys and girls up in my home town are getting
a bigger kick out of finding a stadium site than they
used to hiding the thimble or finding good bunks for
Easter Rabbit nests.
Wit Tenney:—Old Cal Field is to be replaced by a
new stamping grounds for the world's champion Bears,
a billion dollar concrete stadiyum.
Bob Saylor:—Everybody, California YUH stadiYUM.
Loot Nichols: —Where'll we put it?
Wit Tenney:—We shall raze Berkeley to the ground
for as many blocks as we need for our gigantic stadi
yum.
Chorus:—What'll the Redshirts have to say? Turn,
turn, de turn.
An Attorney-at-Law:—You must build it on your own
property.
The Colonel: —Make it Raspberry Canyon then.
Chorus: —Build it in Raspberry Canyon,
But what will the queeners do?
Oh build it in Raspberry Canyon,
They'll queen in the stadium, too.
Prof. Rieber: —As logic prof I resign.
The Colonel: —I cannot comment but you are illogical.
Prof. Rieber: —But my wife is a landscape artist.
Chorus:—Cherchez la femmc!
Faculty:—We shall go to the legislature and the
courts to prevent any such stadium.
The Colonel: —Then everything goes to hell.
Faculty:—Agreed, it's only 40 miles, let all the Big
Games be played in Palo Alto.

Humor for Highbrows: Encina Hall (built in the nine
teenth century) with its pool and billiard tables cover
ed on the Sabbath, versus The Union (built in the
twentieth century) where the balls click merrily on.

Oft in my waking hours I've thought there is only
one thing on earth to beat a woman in ferreting out
news and that's Shelley Pierce. And so —
The other night I dreamt I had died and found my
self stepping into St. Peter's elevator.
"Up or down?" queried the operator.
"Cum laudo," says I, "if you don't mind."
Just then Shelley Pierce steps in with his engaging,
businesslike smile.
"Say," grunts Shelley to the operator, "take me up,
too, because I want to see all there is to see but I
want to know if it isn't better for me to go down below
where there's more gofcig on. I'm a reporter, I al
ways want to go where the news is, and as Mark Twain
said, 'Heaven for climate but Hell for society.'"
"You don't seem afraid, do you?" asked the astonished
operator.
"A good reporter isn't afraid to go anywhere," con
temptuously shrugged Shelley, "Anyway, I've been
working for Hearst's 'Examiner' and we raised hell
every once in a while so I know just what it looks
like."
Of course I went to heaven. I was dreaming, you
see. A few days later I met Shelley with his sprinkling
can, watering some choice gardens. He looked sur
prisingly concave and I realized that the gridioronated
paddles hadn't agreed with his usual good health, and
I suggested as much to him.
"Didn't intend to stay long down below," he said with
a look of how-can-I-tolerate-your-stupidity, "There's
more happening down there but any good journalist
knows it's only the important people that are worth
talking about, and they're all up here. I know my
business."
And when Shelley hasn't an answer —well, there'll be
so many moons in the sky that moonshine whiskey will
be better and cheaper than the real stuff they sold be
fore the war.

FORWARD MARCH!—BEWARE THE IDES!
