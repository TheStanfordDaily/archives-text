Tentative plans for co-operative buy

Interfraternity Conference last evening.
A standing committee of bouse man
agers was appointed to aid H. D. Sxvett,
who is representing tbe conference in
working out a suitable buying plan for
fraternities and sororities.
Representatives of Phi Kappa Psi and
the three houses forming the Fraternity
Council—Alpha Delta Phi, Beta Theta
Pi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon—were pres

agree with the conference that all the
fraternities should work out their prob
