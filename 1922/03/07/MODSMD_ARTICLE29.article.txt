"SCANDAL SHEET" EVADES
UNIVERSITY CENSORSHIP
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH, Salt Lake,
March 7. (P.1.N.5.) — Consternation,
wrath, rejoicing, etc., were registered
on the faces of the campus habitues
as they were awakened to a semblance
of life yesterday morning at the cry
of "Wuxtree, Wuxtree, Poiper here."
The commotion was due to the mem
bers of the local chapter of Pi Delta
Epsilon, national journalistic frater
nity, selling the initial issue of the
'Utah Sequel' a three-colored scandal
sheet, published by the organization.
This is the first attempt to put out
such a publication on the Utah cam
pus, the organization having been
thwarted in its purooses last year by
action of the Dean's Council. Many
lurid tales of Bacchanalian revelry
and morbid 'misdoing' were disclosed
to the alarmed and hungry eyes of
the students and professors on the
campus. It is the opinion of the
campus that the initial sheet was a
decided success.
