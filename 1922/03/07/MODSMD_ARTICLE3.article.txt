# PAGEANT REHEARSALS SHOW INSUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR DANCES
## 
### 
Rehearsals in ensemble work for
the Women's Athletic Association
pageant have not shown the sufficient
number of women needed for effective
portrayal of pantomime and dancing.
Miss Edith Pasmore, in charge of this
work announces the continuation of
preliminary rehearsals, Wednesday
and Friday, this week, at 4 and 5
o'clock.
The practices will be carried on in
sections so that women will not have
too much time on the work. Winter
quarter rehearsals will not give indi
vidual women more than one dance to
participate in.
Tryouts will be held next quarter
for parts in the cast and in individual
interpretative .dancing numbers.
