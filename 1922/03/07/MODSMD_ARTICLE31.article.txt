### 
FOUR POWER PACT
. The Administration hopes to ob
tain ratification of the Four Power
Pact in the Senate this week. Sen
ator Lodge, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, seems confident
that the necessary two-thirds vote can
be secured. But his assurance is be
lied by his anxiety in regard to the
enforced absence, on account of ill
ness, of some of the senators who are
slated to support the treaty. The op
position claims to be sure of thirty
votes against it which means that they
have to find only three more to defeat
the Pact.
LLOYD GEORGE AND THE
COALITION
The Coalition government of Eng
land with Lloyd George at its head,
which has been in power since 1916
had perhaps the narrowest escape in
its career during the last few clays.
During the Prime Minister's recent
absence from London, Sir George
Younger, leader of the extreme con
servatives, but also a supposed sup
porter of the Coalition, was instru
mental in bringing about an associa
tion of conservative independents.
The purpose of this move appeared
to be separation from the. Coalition
and a return to party politics.
In the face of the so-called attack
Lloyd George threatened to resign
last Thursday. Immediately Austen
Chamberlain, Sir Worthington Evans
and Sir Arthur Balfour, prominent
leaders of the Unionist group of the
Coalition, publicly pledge their support
and that of their followers to Lloyd
George and his government.
This was followed by Sir George
Younger's statement that his actions
were not intended to be a challenge
in the Coalition which he had hoped
would remain in power until a general
election.
Loyd George has promised to re

main in power at least until after the
Genoa Conference. His friends be
lieve that he hopes to make this his
final triumph aitd that after it he will
resign from office and retire to pri
vate life.
SPLIT IN HARDING'S CABINET
The first openly unharmonious note
in the relations between members of
President Harding's cabinet comes
from the dispute arising over Alaskan
affairs between Secretary of the In
terior Fall and Secretary of Agricul
ture Wallace. Secretary Fall wants
the entire supervision of the adminis
tration of Alaska to be under his con
trol. The extensive work of the For
estry Service is, however, under the
Department of Agriculture. Each of

the two cabinet members has laid his
case before the President and bills
to carry out the plans of each have
been submitted to Congress.
