Editor Daily Palo Alto:—Thursday
evening of this week the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra plays in
the Memorial Church in memory of the
Founders of this University. One
year ago they gave a concert in the
Memorial Church which was not as
beautiful and expressive as it might
have been, because some few express
ed their appreciation by making noise.
It would be applause elsewhere or on
a different occasion, but in the Chapel
and on Founders' Day it is only noise,
and I have found myself not alone in
thinking of it as such.
Could it not be possible that this
concert be unspoiled by a demonstra
tion such as occurred last year. The
members of the orchestra would un
derstand and appreciate silence, as T
was close enough to them last year
to plainly read disapproval on their
faces.
Let all of us, out of respect to the
memory of the Stan fords and the
Chapel, do as much as we can to keep
'he spirit of the occasion as it should
be. W. G. M.. '23.
