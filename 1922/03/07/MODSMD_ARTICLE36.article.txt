## 
### 
Considerable confusion having arisen
as to who is responsible for medical
treatments in the University on account
of the large number of cases during the
flu epidemic, the following is published'
by the Stanford medical adviser, Dr. A.
D. Browne. /
Some students arc of the opinion that
they are entitled to free medical treat
mc;:t \v!u n sick here and think that the
duties of the adviser are to take care of
the sick here in addition to his regular
routine of work in the gymnasium.
The purpose of the Students' Guild is
also explained in the following article:
The duties of the medical adviser of
men shall beâ€”
To give medical advice.
To give only emergency treatments.
To give phyical examinations to all
students registered. The medical ad

The services rendered by the Students'
Guild to students are as follows :
1. Provide ordinary hospital care and
nursing at the Palo Alto, Lane, and Iso
lation Hospitals at a rate of $2 per day
less than the regular ward rates.
2. Pay the operating fees and the cost
of special accommodations where they
are necessary.
3. Maintain the Isolation Hospital
ready for any emergency.
4. Pay the bill for medical attendance
by any reputable and licensed physician
