# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM AGAIN LEADS LEAGUE
## 
### 
When the Barbarian soccer squad
trounced the Olympic eleven two goals
to one last Saturday, the Cardinal kick
ers automatically became the leaders of
the University and Club League. Stan
ford and the Olympic Club were tied
for first honors, each team having one
defeat and four tied games to its credit.
The Barbarian victory, however,-breaks
this tie and once more gives Coach
Harry Maloney's players the top-notch
position.
The announcement of the Barb vic
tory was heralded with joy by the soccer
team, as it probably docs away with
a none too much cherished game with
the Olympic Club. The Stanford eleven
has one more game to play to complete
its schedule and, as it is with one of
the weakest teams, in the league, the var
sity undoubtedly will win and thus pro
cure the championship. If the Cards
lose this game, a third game with the
Olympic Club will settle the tic.
"This is the second victory that the
Barbs have hung up this season on the
Winged O, the Stanford squad having
fought out two no-score contests with
the club men. The winning of the game
caused the Barbarians to nose California
out for fourth place in the league.
