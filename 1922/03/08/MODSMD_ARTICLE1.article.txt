full dress rehearsal last evening show

most of.
Lighting will be a prominent ele

applied in all sincerity to "If I Were
King."

opposite type, the gracious Katherine, first lady of the court. The love
of both women for Francois Villon, the vagabond poet of France, runs
through the entire four acts. Seibwill play Villon.
