will make up the program of Founders' Day, tomorrow. A general holiday has
been proclaimed and the day is to he dedicated to the memory of the foiuidÂ«?rs
of the university, the Stanford family.
"The University and the Public," > s the subject which Chester H. Kowell
has chosen for the address which hi? wi'l deliver at the university assembly to be

held at 11 o clock tomorrow morning in
the Assembly Hall. Mr. Rowell's talk
will open the program which is arranged
annually on March 9 in observance of
the day of the founding of Stanford.
At present, Mr. Rowell is a member of
the State .Railway Commission and is
recognized as one of the foremost pub
licists in the country, and is widely
known as a journalist. His work as edi
tor and publisher of the Fresno Repub
lican a few years ago made that paper
one of the outstanding newspapers- -in
the state. He is a member of the Board
of Regents of the University of Cali
fornia and is especially interested in the
activities of educational institutions
throughout the country.
Mr. Rowell will be remembered for
the Roosevelt memorial address which
he gave here two years ago. He has
been a frequent visitor to the campus
since that time and has spoken at several
meetings and assemblies here during the
past year.
The university's increased activities
throughout the state in the last few
years have led the committee in charge
of the Founders' Day to plan programs
of a more general nature. It is with this
idea in mind that Mr. Howell has se
lected the subject for his address and
will speak especially of the relation of
the university to the public.
