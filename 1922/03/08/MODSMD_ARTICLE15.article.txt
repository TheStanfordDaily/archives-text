# GLEE CLUB GIVES THIRD PROGRAM
## Argall and Malaby in Solo Numbers, Gain Applause at Concert in San Francisco 
### Leon David, '25 
Excellent technique and finess in
the choral numbers, and interesting
and well-given solos made the third
concert ot' the Glee Club, presented
last evening in San Francisco, a com
plete musical success. Scottish Rite
Auditorium, where the concert was
held, contained a medium-sized crowd
that evinced great appreciation of the
work of the club. Scores of people
from the audience flocked about the
members of the organization to con
gratulate them and Director Warren
D. Allen, at the conclusion of the
evening's program.
Marsden Argali, singing a series of
three solos, including the "Toreador
Song," from "Carmen," received much
applause. His singing apparently was
unimpaired by his recent illness, and
through his singing in the "Faust,"
"Messiah," and "Verdi," productions
given here in former years.
The varied program of the club was
the subject of much favorable com
ment. As arranged, the members in
cluded all types of song, from the
pathetic and the weird, to the humor
ous ditty and the forceful opera num
ber. Bruno Huhn's "Invictus," the
Student Songs of Finland, the "Lone
some Tunes," "The Shadow March,"
"Requiem," and "O Hail Us. Ye Free!"
from "Ernani," were some of the num
bers which were best in their differ-
ent. classes.
Director Warren D. Allen was much
pleased with the showing of the club,
which has been so trained that it is
instantaneously responsive in giving
variations of tone and of feeling for
which he calls during the concerts.
To outside observers this feature has
become so characteristic of the club
that it seems as if it were some grand
musical instrument which (Director
Allen plays, rather than leads.
Mrs. W. D. Allen, guest soloist of
the club, was at her best'in her aria
"O My Heart is Weary," from Na
disha, which was heartily encored.
The sympathetic qualities of her
voice were well brought out in the
"Lonesome Tunes," and "Requiem,"
which she sang with the accompani
ment of the club.
Richard Malaby displayed great
skill in his piano solos. According to
many good musicians, his work is of
professional caliber, and continued
successes are expected for him.
Definite arrangements have been
completed for the spring tour of the
club. The first concert is to be given
at the Salinas Union High School, on
the evening of March 24. The club
will probably sing at Del Monte and
Watsonville, and from there go north
to Santa Rosa, Healdsburg, and Peta
luma. These concerts will be follow
ed by others at Sacramento, Willows,
Tracy and Chico. Thirty-two men are
to make the trip. Transportation by
auto is planned.
