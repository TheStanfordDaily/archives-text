holdovers, 57 seconds, and the fresh
men, 58 seconds.
The program which will be run off
under the direction of Quadrangle
Club, is scheduled in this order: Hold-
Over Show, Irish Marathon, 100-yard
three-legged race; 100-yard backward
race; quarter-mile walk; greased pig

fastest varsity and fastest non-varsity
time, special merchandise awards of
approximately $4 apiece have been
donated by Roos Bros., Wideman's,
Thoits, and Friedlander and Nauman,
for the winners of the feature events.
Quadrangle Club members have;
been assigned to the four teams, and j

preliminaries. Doug Bundy, '21, will
have charge of the senior and hold
over squad. Jimmy Davies, '22, the
juinor; Art Wilcox, '21, the sopho
mores. and "Red" Tauzer, '20, the j

The hold-over show, which is the !
outstanding comedy event to be put

much else.
