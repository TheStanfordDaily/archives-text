# FOUNDERS' DAY
## 
### 
loniorrow we celebrate the remembrance of those
who founded Stanford University. By simple exer
cises we show our appreciation for the Stanford
family and what they have done for us and for our
education. In the past we have had dedicatory
exercises marking the start on the erection of some
new building or other part of the University. These
services which we have had have marked our vari
ous stages of growth as a powerful institution.
Last Founders' Day President Wilbur broke the
ground for the Stadium, which stands today a mark
of engineering genius and loyal workmanship.
Mayo Newhall laid the corner stone for the new
Union .which is now occupied in part and will be
ready for complete occupation in a month. A year
ago the basketball pavilion was still a thing of paper,
and it has been in use for three months. All these
things were placed before us last Founders' Day
and now all are realized.
This year, with these things done, we are in a
period of more solid advancement than ever before.
We have a good start for the new endowment and
have everything to look forward to on this day of
celebration.
Chester Rowell will be the main speaker at the
Student Assembly at 11 o'clock. Rowell is so well
known that he needs no introduction to us here. He
is speaking on the subject of education, and his
knowledge of the subject from every point of view
makes him a man particularly fitted for the place.
