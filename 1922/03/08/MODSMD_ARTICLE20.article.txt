# SECRET DEPREDATION
## 
### 
Unlawful mob acts are daily taking place through
out the state and are being attributed to the Klu
Klux. Down in Taft a man is beaten and forced to
flee, leaving hsi property. Perhaps he is guilty of
some misfeasance against the law of the state or has
committed some moral sin against a member of his
community. But he has not laid himself open to the
action of a mob, no matter what perfect organiza
tion it may have.
Secret administration of justice is something fun
damentally adverse to the American spirit of inde
l>endence. It was antagonism to this secret work
that caused the break down of the Ku Klux after
the Civil War when in many cases great good was
l>eing done by clan members. Our courts afford a
road to justice which is slow in some cases but sure
in the end. There every man has a right to be
heard and impartially tried, and he can not enjoy
such a right when he is arraigned in secret by a band
which i smore or less prejudiced.
Ku Kluv Klan advertises that it is for the purpose
of furthering Americanism in business and the de
part mens of governmen. So much has been covered
in he past by claiming to operate for this supposed
"Americanism" that the secret operation of the clan
is bringing much censure upon itself by sober people
who rcmeml>er past outrages laid at the door of Ku
Klux, and fail to see the need for this hidden power
now.
