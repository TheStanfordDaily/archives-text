The Haberdash
A coat of dust lay on the field. People lined the
slopes. Under wear of the roughest sort for weeks,
the track, with its white stripes, stretched away in the
distance under the constant wash of the sea of hu
manity.
Suddenly a gun ripped the silence, and a thread of
runners tore along the lines. The pants of the racers
became audible. When the tape was breasted, the
younger young man, vested in a new dignity, broke
through the belt of his friends, and heedless of the
shouts of "tie," made for the clubhouse, his supporters
shooing all out of his path. To cap the climax, the
losers charged everything, and brought in a big union
suit, whereupon the affair ended in a general unravel
ing.

Takes a lot to rile up. But—now we ask you—
wouldn't you use the book-ends on the cantaloupe who
springs this: "So fatiguing, you know, having nothing
to do. Ah, yes, I have just finished studying for the
finals."
* * *
Yep, we now have a real celebrity in our midst. Ranks
with Bernhardt, Warfield, Bryan, and all the stronger
ranks. Gaze on him, ladies and gentlemen, our own
dear Les (What's this, more publicity?), who is now
in his second farewell appearance. Remember how he
made his absolutely final performance in campus dra
matics last fall in "A Tailor-Made Man"? And just
think, now he's famous, or might as well he.

Seems that there's a guy falls dead after drawing a
royal flush. Sure is tough. The coroner's jury expected
to bring in one of two decisions —either the poor bird
died because his heart failed, or he died of rage because
it was only a nickel limit.

The Demon Ball Fan
With the tally snarled at five-all. and the concluding
portion of the ninth cantata chalked up. Catty McOw
dislocated the souper for the first time during the orgy,
and sent nine pellets down the alley in a straight row.
allowing three biffers to whiff the ozone. This squashed
the side, and flung the clash into extra spasms.
Things then traveled along smoothly until the
twelfth encore, when the Pea-green machine picked up
a tack and ran around. The figures were still knotted
at five all, and the redoubtless Catty strode to the pan
with flame in his orbs. The slabster slung the slug
down the sluice. Catty swung. There was a protracted
collision as horsehide hit hickory; then a long drawn
out explosion burst from the stands —for the sphere
had soared over the right parapet for a circut clout,
which unraveled the tangled score and tucked the series
safely down the necks of the Amnesians.

Suddenly a gun ripped the silence, and a thread of
runners tore along the lines. The pants of the racers
became audible. When the tape was breasted, the
younger young man, vested in a new dignity, broke
through the belt of his friends, and heedless of the
shouts of "tie," made for the clubhouse, his supporters
shooing all out of his path. To cap the climax, the

made his absolutely final performance in campus dra
