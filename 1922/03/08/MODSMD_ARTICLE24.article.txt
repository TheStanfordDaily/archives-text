# PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS ANNOUNCEMENT!

### 
The annual convention of the high
school principals of the State of Cali
fornia will be held in Pasadena the
week beginning April 10, 1922. Many
of the principals will at that time seek
definite information from Appointment
Secretaries regarding available candi
dates. Owing to my absence from the
Appointment Office during the month
of February—partly on account of
business, and partly on account of
illness—l feel that I am not sufficient
ly well acquainted with those who
have registered with the office for the
first time this winter to be of real
service to them. I am, therefore, ar
ranging to see by appointment during
the week of March 13th all prospect
ive teachers in California high schools
(those who will hold either special
secondary certificates or regular sec
ondary certificates, and who will be
available in the fall of 1922). Appoint
ments for this purpose can be made
for any half-hour which is preferred
between 9 and 12 or between 1 and 4,
March 13 to 17 inclusive. To arrange
for appointments telephone or see Mrs.
Power of the Appointment Office.
Please do not neglect tho make your
appointment during the week speci

fled. No definite appointments for
htis purpose can be made during any
other week.
Do not fail to make an appointment.
(MRS.) ELIZABETH SNELL,
Appointment Secretary.
