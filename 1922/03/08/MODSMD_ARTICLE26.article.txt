# British Vice Consul Speaks to Economics Club
## 
### 
"Modern diplomacy and future poli
tics will, to a great extent rest upon
the commercial world," was the sub
stance of Mr. E. H. Davies' address
at the meeting of the Economics Club
in the Union last evening. Mr. Daviea,
a member of the British consular ser
vice and now living in San Francisco,
has an up-to-date viewpoint of trade
relations between his country and the

United States, especially the Pacific
Coast which he says will undoubtedly
develop more direct trade relations
with Great Britain through the Pana
ma Canal instead of through New
York and other Atlantic sea-ports.
Mr. Davies has spent much of his
life in Canada and during the war was
purchasing agent for Canadian sup
plies in this country.
Nelson Valjean closed the program
of the smoker with one of his clever
skits, after which refreshments were
served.
