# FRESHMAN TOSSERS PLAY OAKLAND HIGH SCHOOL HERE TODAY
## 
### 
This afternoon, the Oakland High
baseball squad will meet the fresh
men, and on Saturday two games are
scheduled. Oakland Technical High
School will play In the morning and
either Alameda or San Francisco Poly
technic will furnish the opposition in
the aft#rnoon.
Coach Kallam is building one of the
strongest baseball machines that has
ever worn the Cardinal numerals from
the 1921 squad and if something does
not turn up to wreck the team, "Nibs"
Price and his Bruin babe nine will
receive a warm greeting when they
invade the Farm for the first game
of the freshman series. The infield is
working in great style, but few errors
being chalked up against them in the
games played thus far. McDonald at
first is improving daily and gives the
promise of developing into a fast ball
player. Hoffman, freshman basketball
star, reported for practice for the first
time yesterday. He has the reputation
of being an all-around ball player, his
favorite position being first base.
Should Hoffman show a good brand
of ball, McDonald will have to work
hard to keep his position. Roberts is
performing in big league style at the
keystone sack and Mulkey at short
is a valuable man. These two men
work well together. Cuddeback is
taking the hot ones at the difficult
corner in a satisfactory manner and
getting his share of the hits.
In the outfield, Lawson, Brown, and
McCandless are gathering in the high
ones with regularity and these three
men are all good hitters. Aydelotte,
Follansbee, Solomon, and Teague form
a pitching staff which is causing the
opposing batters no end of trouble.
Charles Johnson and Lawson are do
ing the bulk of the receiving and both
are hitting consistently.
Solomon is slated to start against
Oakland High this afternoon, with the
rest of the team lining up as in the
last few games.
