# CARDINAL PUGILISTS MEET BLUE AND GOLD HERE SATURDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's Varsity Boxing Squad will
enter its first tournament of the year
against the Blue and Gold pugilists
in the pavilion, Saturday night. Indi
cations point to the fact that there
should be some fast matches. Fight
fans still recall the bouts fought in
the California-Stanford tournament
last year, and both universities enter
ed good men in every weight this
year.
The ring for the bouts Saturday
night will be put on a high platform
in the center of the pavilion floor and
in such a position that every seat in
the house will be a good one. There
will be a women's section reserved.
There were several women at the eli
mination bouts last Saturday night and
a section will be reserved Saturday
night to accommodate any women stu
dents or outsiders who desire to come.
Tickets for the matches will be one
dollar to outsiders and twenty-five
cents to students with student cards.
