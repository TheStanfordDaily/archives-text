# ENCINA CLUB SMOKER INCLUDES FOUR STUNTS
## 
### 
Knox Miller and "Jake" Irwin went
three rounds in an exhibition boxing
match last night at the quarterly Kncina
smoker. Irwin was puzzled for a time
by the way Miller held his gloves, bur
was able, nevertheless, to land sotne hard
punches.
A rather slow bout between Freeman
and Petta, freshmen, closed the program.
The bantamweights used up so much
energy in the first round that the blows
landed in the last round were mere love
taps.
