# VALUE OF ANIMALS DURING WAR TOPIC OF TUESDAY LECTURE
## 
### 
"We have heard much of the ser
vice our soldiers gave during the war,
but little of what our animal allies
did; and never in the history of man
kind, have animals played such an im
portant part," was the statement made
my Ernest Harold Baynes, war cor
respondent, and famous naturalist, in
his lecture in the Little Theatre, last
night.
The lecturer spoke of the fact that
canaries were used not only in sub
marines and gas tanks for the detec
tion of bad air, but were put on hospi
tal trains, to sing for the wounded
soldiers.
Mascots also, although they did not
play a vital part in the war, assumed
a considerable importance in helping
to keep up the morale of the men.
Perhaps the most unusual and spec
tacular type of war service contributed
by the "animal Allies" was that of
the homing pigeons, who constituted
a great messenger service. They
were noted for their wonderful cour
age and faithfulness often accomplish
ing miraculous rescues. Homing pige
ons, who would go distances of from
500 to 1000 miles, were never sent
further than seventy miles during the
war, and so infallible was their record,
that over nine-five per cent of them
arrived at their destination.
Mr. Baynes, in describing further
this extraordinary type of war hero,
stated, "The trainer had colored bands
marked and tabulated, with corres
ponding colored band? on the le.i of
the pigeon, which enabled a new care
taker to ascertain which pigeon had
b&en trained for a certain route. The
messages were written on a piece of
thin paper, folded, refolded, and then
slipped into a capsule, which was in
turn placed on the leg of the bird.
Larger maps or moving picture films j
went into a knapsack over the breast J
of the animal, strapped on over the
shoulders. In one such instance, fif
teen feet of film were carried in this
fashion."
"Cher Ami," who was known as the!
greatest of the American Pigeon birds,
homed twenty-one miles in twenty-two
minutes, after being wounded in the
Argonne. Several of the birds were
decorated in France for their service,
one even receiving the Croix de
Guerre, after undergoing terrible |
shell fire in order to reach Verdun.
He spoke of the part played by the
oxen and donkeys in their transport
work, although practically sixty thou
sand of the former were lost as a re
sult of the diseases caused by the
Testi fly. The camels also proved in
valuable, as they carried on the aver
age twenty-five gallons of water at a
time. These animals were of three
distinct types, the light-burden, the
lieavy-burden, and the fast-riding.
The lecturer then went on to de
scribe the Scotch collie, who was much
in demand on account of his great in
telligence and good speed. In Bel
gium, Mr. Baynes saw the machine
gun dogs rushing guns to the front,
or, with pack-saddles on their backs,
containing rations for the men.
Doubtless the horses, of which there
sixteen million employed during the
war, proved the most invaluable assets
as "animal Allies," according to Mr.
Baynes. They were forced to undergo
the greatest hardships, standing out
in the mud and snow for hours, with
scarcely any shelter. Cavalry horses
as cavalry was used very little, were
employed largely as patrol horses, and
in the transports. Many of them suf
fered from shell wounds and dis
eases."
The lecture which Mr. Baynes gave
last night was a summary of the one
he gave before the Lowell Institute of
Boston, some time ago. He was a
special correspondent for Harper's
magazine and a representative of the
Natural History Association in New
York.
