# CAMPUS JOURNALISTS HEAR COWLES SPEAK ON ASSOCIATED PRESS
## 
### 
"The Wurk and Organization of the
Associated Press" was the subject of
the talk by Mr. Paul Cowles at an open
meeting of the Stanford Chapter of the
American Journalists' Association, held
last night at the Kappa Alpha Theta
house. Mr. Cowles is at present the su
perintendent of the western division of
the Associated Press, which 'extends
from Alaska to southern Mexico, and
from Denver, Colo., to China.
The Associted Press, according to Mr.
Cowles, is a co-operative organization
which acts as a clearing house for news
for its thirteen hundred members in
North and South America, Hawaii, and
the Philippine Islands. In the United
States alone it has over seventy-five
thousand miles of leased telephone and
telegraph wires. During the World War
the expenses of the Associated Press
reached seven million dollars a year
with an average daily expenditure of
seven thousand dollars for cable tolls
alone.
Mr. Cowles expressed his approval of
the journalism schools now found in
many universities. In his opinion, the
men who take a college course in jour
nalism prior to entering the newspaper
"game" have, because of their higher
ideals and superior command of English,
a better chance of succeeding in the jour
nalistic field than those who have not
had this preparation.
