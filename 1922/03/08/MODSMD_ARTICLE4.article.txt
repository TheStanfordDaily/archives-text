# SKULL AND SNARES RECOMMENDS BLOCK "S" FOR BLANKETS
## 
### 
Change from the Indian head pattern
to a block "S" as the design on varsity
football blankets was recommended to
the Executive Committee and the Board
of Athletic Control, at a session last
night.
Plans were made for a jolly-up to be
given on April 8, the first Saturday after
spring quarter registration. This will
be a closed date. It was decided to
charge 75 cents a head. The regulation
of the baseball fight, which is to be under
Skull and Snakes' supervision, was dis
cussed, but no system was adopted at
this meeting.
