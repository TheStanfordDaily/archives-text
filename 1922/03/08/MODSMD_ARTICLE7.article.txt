# VARSITY NINE WILL PLAY INDEPENDENTS
## Stanford Players Have Game With Phoenix Squad from St. Mary's This Afternoon 
### 
As the main baseball diversion of the
Founder's Day program, the redoubtable
Clift Ireland, with his choice repertoire
of jokes, and his strong aggregation of
professional ball players, will appear
against Duffy Seay's tossers tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30.
From all appearances, Ireland's co
horts have the Indian sign on the Cardi
nal varsity this year. Twice before have
the nines clashed, and the visitors won
botli times. The Stanford players have
simply been unable to connect with the
offerings of Herb Manouck, the lanky
hurler who lias been flitting in and out
of the Coast League the past three years.
No less a personage than George Kelly,
guardian of the first sack for the world's
champion Giants when they captured the
big series last fall, pastimed with the In
dependents on their last appearance here.
Just who Cliff will import is not known,
but the veteran leader has several celebri
ties in baseballdom lined up.
After the Independents' last victory
over the Cardinal by a 3 to 1 score, Ire
land was complaining that his club could
never run up more than three runs, so
he has probably recruited more hitting
strength.
The personnel of the varsity is more
or less uncertain. Ratner, catcher, Pat
terson, lirst, and Heckendorf. third, ap
pear to be fixtures, with Peavy probably
starting at second. Maillot or Wood
ward will pastime at shortstop. Seay
