# VARSITY NINE WILL PLAY INDEPENDENTS
## Stanford Players Have Game With Phoenix Squad from St. Mary's This Afternoon 
### 
As the main baseball diversion of the
Founder's Day program, the redoubtable
Clift Ireland, with his choice repertoire
of jokes, and his strong aggregation of
professional ball players, will appear
against Duffy Seay's tossers tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30.
From all appearances, Ireland's co
horts have the Indian sign on the Cardi
nal varsity this year. Twice before have
the nines clashed, and the visitors won
botli times. The Stanford players have
simply been unable to connect with the
offerings of Herb Manouck, the lanky
hurler who lias been flitting in and out
of the Coast League the past three years.
No less a personage than George Kelly,
guardian of the first sack for the world's
champion Giants when they captured the
big series last fall, pastimed with the In
dependents on their last appearance here.
Just who Cliff will import is not known,
but the veteran leader has several celebri
ties in baseballdom lined up.
After the Independents' last victory
over the Cardinal by a 3 to 1 score, Ire
land was complaining that his club could
never run up more than three runs, so
he has probably recruited more hitting
strength.
The personnel of the varsity is more
or less uncertain. Ratner, catcher, Pat
terson, lirst, and Heckendorf. third, ap
pear to be fixtures, with Peavy probably
starting at second. Maillot or Wood
ward will pastime at shortstop. Seay
may experiment with his outfielders, but
Carver, Wayland, and Parker seem to
have the call on the outer garden posi
tions.
This afternoon the Cardinal diamond
men are crossing bats with the St. Mary's
nine from Oakland. In days gone by,
the Phoenix tossers would have ranked
with the leaders anywhere, but more re
cently they have fallen out of the first
class. This year, however, their follow
ers claim that their nine is up to the
standard of former years.
Draper seems likely to draw the hurl
ing assignment for this afternoon. In
case the veteran moundsman goes the
entire route, Seay will have Clark,
Loewenstein, and Kelly on deck for the
battle with the Independents tomorrow.
Clark has had over a week's rest and is
favored to start on the hillock for the
Cardinal.
