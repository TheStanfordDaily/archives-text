# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA TO PLAY IN CHAPEL
## Alfred Hertz Will Direct San Francisco Symphonists in Stanford Chapel Tomorrow 
### 
The program which the Sail Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, under the
direction of Alfred Hertz, will pre
sent in the Memorial Church, at 8
o'clock tomorrow evening contains
numbers which are varied in their
style and mood.
The first selection will be the Sym
phony No. 2 in 1) major, by Brahms.
This work is sometimes called
"Pastoral." Although the main me
lody has a spontaneous flow and
freshness which give the whole sym
phony a general tone of serenity, it
is usually considered that this name
has been wrongly applied to it. Its
feeling of primeval simpliciay brings
it nearer to the heroic than to the
pastoral, and it is thought that the
composer himself had no intention of
presenting a pastoral picture.
"Death and Transfiguration," (he
most popular of the tone poems by
Strauss, was given at the concert by
the Symphony Orchestra on Founders'
Day list year and will be repeated to
morrow night. It is generally regarded
as the most satisfactory of the works
of Strauss from the structural and
emotional viewpoint. It tells of the
last hours of a man in the pangs of
death, of his struggles with approach
ing death, of his dreams over his past
life, of his final gasp, and finally of
his transfiguration in HeaVen. Alex
ander Ritter, a friend of Strauss, has
written a poem by the same name as
the musical composition and which
was inspired by it.
The orchestra will also play a Rus
sian Easter Overture by Rimsky-Kor
sakov, a modern Russian composer,
and an air from the D. major suite by
Bach. The latter is usually given as
a violin solo and is known as the "Air
on the G string."
Admission to the concert will be
by ticket only, on account of the
limited capacity ol' the church. Tickets
were distributed to students and mem
bers of the faculty and administrative
staff during the past two days.
