# CALIFORNIA WILL SEND PUGILISTS HERE TOMORROW
## First Boxing Tournament of Season to be in Pavilion; Women's Section Reserved Stanford 
### 
Coach Stanley Jones' Blue and Gold
pugilists will meet the Cardinal box
ers tomorrow night, at 7:30, in the
basketball pavilion. This will be the
first tournament of the year for the
Stanford team, while Coach Jones'
men have taken part in several meets.
The Bruin boxers had their best
workout of the season last Friday
night, when they journeyed to Davis
Fdrm where they engaged in nine
bouts, six of which they won. Two
of the six victories came via the
knockout route.
The bouts Saturday promise to be
the best witnessed here in some time.
That Stanford will be represented by
some fast men was evidenced in the
elimination bouts last Saturday night
when the men who are to meet the
California team were picked. There
will be six bouts which will decide
the championship between the two
universities in addition to three ex
hibition matches.
In the 115-pound class, Sol Silver
man will represent California against
Thomas Bowles. Little is known of
either man but the little fellows can
usually be depended upon to put up
a good fight. George Long, the clever
little featherweight will meet Kenny
Shipp in the 125-pound class. Long is
said to be in mid-season form. He
won his match against Davis Farm
with ease. He is said to carry a wick
ed punch in either mitt. Shipp is
also going in great style, his wicked
right accounting for every bout he has
won this year. This should be one
of the hardest fought bouts on the
card.
Bill Burkhard, the hard hitting Car
dinal welterweight is meeting a tough
opponent in "Walt" Robinson. Burk
hard is improving daily and as he is
in the best of condition he should give
good account of himself. "Husky"
Wassum's opponent in the middle
weight class has not been determined
yet. Should Jimmie Cline, the Cali
fornia ace be declared eligible, he
will be Wassum's opponent, but if
not, Bob Crowley will represent Cali
fornia in the middleweight class. In
either case, the bout should be a good
one. Wassum is well known to box
ing fans on the campus and he is out
to uphold his reputation, Saturday
night. Cline is known here as one
of the best fighters in his class in
collegiate boxing circles on the coast.
Crowley is also reputed to be a dan
