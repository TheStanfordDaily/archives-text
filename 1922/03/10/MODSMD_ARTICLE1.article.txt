# CALIFORNIA WILL SEND PUGILISTS HERE TOMORROW
## First Boxing Tournament of Season to be in Pavilion; Women's Section Reserved Stanford 
### 
Coach Stanley Jones' Blue and Gold
pugilists will meet the Cardinal box
ers tomorrow night, at 7:30, in the
basketball pavilion. This will be the
first tournament of the year for the
Stanford team, while Coach Jones'
men have taken part in several meets.
The Bruin boxers had their best
workout of the season last Friday
night, when they journeyed to Davis
Fdrm where they engaged in nine
bouts, six of which they won. Two
of the six victories came via the
knockout route.
The bouts Saturday promise to be
the best witnessed here in some time.
That Stanford will be represented by
some fast men was evidenced in the
elimination bouts last Saturday night
when the men who are to meet the
California team were picked. There
will be six bouts which will decide
the championship between the two
universities in addition to three ex
hibition matches.
In the 115-pound class, Sol Silver
man will represent California against
Thomas Bowles. Little is known of
either man but the little fellows can
usually be depended upon to put up
a good fight. George Long, the clever
little featherweight will meet Kenny
Shipp in the 125-pound class. Long is
said to be in mid-season form. He
won his match against Davis Farm
with ease. He is said to carry a wick
ed punch in either mitt. Shipp is
also going in great style, his wicked
right accounting for every bout he has
won this year. This should be one
of the hardest fought bouts on the
card.
Bill Burkhard, the hard hitting Car
dinal welterweight is meeting a tough
opponent in "Walt" Robinson. Burk
hard is improving daily and as he is
in the best of condition he should give
good account of himself. "Husky"
Wassum's opponent in the middle
weight class has not been determined
yet. Should Jimmie Cline, the Cali
fornia ace be declared eligible, he
will be Wassum's opponent, but if
not, Bob Crowley will represent Cali
fornia in the middleweight class. In
either case, the bout should be a good
one. Wassum is well known to box
ing fans on the campus and he is out
to uphold his reputation, Saturday
night. Cline is known here as one
of the best fighters in his class in
collegiate boxing circles on the coast.
Crowley is also reputed to be a dan
gerous man with the padded mitts.
Mark Evans, veteran Card light
heavyweight is slated to meet G. H.
Brereton. Evans is back in old-time
form and should give his man a warm
reception.
The feature bout of the evening will
be fought in the light weight class be
tween Jimmie Ross and Bennie Ein
zig. Einzig has lately transferred to
California from the Southern Branch
and he is said to be nothing short of
sensational in his wprk in the roped
arena. He knocked out his Davis
Farm adversary in the first round of
the bout and is coming here Saturday
confident of another victory. He is
scheduled to meet some stiff opposi
tion, however, when he enters the ring
with Jimmie Ross. Ross has improveed
greatly since his last appearance in
the ring. He is faster on his feet, hits
harder, and displays better ring gener
alship.
The exhibition bouts look to be
equally as fast as the main event
bouts. Little has been heard of the
California men in these events, but
the Cardinal representatives are well
known to fight fans here. Jack Fish
burn, the boy who force.d Jimmy Ross
to extend himself to win in the elimi
nation bouts meets Abe Rubin. Walter
Bills, hard hitting welterweight will
oppose Bernie Garcia. Big Jim Arthur,
the boy who packsj a ton of dynamite
in either mitt has a dangerous man to
meet in Ahlswede, the big football
player who has been winning his bouts
consistently.
The Stanford team has been work
ing out daily on the track and in the
gymnasium and the men are all ready
for the gong Saturday night. Most of
the work of the Bruin squad has been
confined to the gymnasium as the
weather has been unfavorable to track
work.
Willie Ritchie, former lightweight
champion of the world, will referee
the bouts and Sol Levinson will act
as judge. Admission to the matches
will be twenty-five cents to students
with student cards and one dollar to
outsiders. A special section has been
reserved for women spectators.
