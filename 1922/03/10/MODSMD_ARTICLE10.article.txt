# JOHNSTON AND GRIFFIN WIN CLOSE MATCH FROM VARSITY
## 
### 
William Johnston and Clarence
"Peck" Griffin defeated the Stanford
doubles team of Neer and Davies in an
exhibition tennis match on the varsity
courts yesterday afternoon. Only one
set was played, the score being 12-10.
Previous to their Stanford bout, John
ston and Griffin, who are former na
tional doubles champions, defeated the
Kinsey brothers, 6-4, 12-10.
In the match between the Cardinal
team and Johnston and Griffin, the
Stanford pair had the advantage until
the last two games, when the San Fran
cisco team forged into the lead and cap
tured the set and the match. Several
times during the play Neer and Davies
were within point-set of taking the
match, but at each time the champions
rallied.
In both matches, Johnston lived up to
his reputation of being one of the hard
est drivers known in the net game to
day, and on several occasions his well
placed drives brought forth applause
from the spectators. The feature of
the second match of the exhibition bout
was the playing of Phil Neer. The in
tercollegiate champion was in good
form in placing his shots and showed

exceptional ability at dropping the ball
near the side lines.
One of the highest brands of tennis
played in the world today was exhibited
in the match between Johnston and Grif
fin and the Kinsey brothers' team. John
ston and Griffin have twice been national
doubles champions, while the Kinsey
brothers were Coast champions last year
and rate well up among the doubles
team in the national rating. In the sec
ond set of the match, the Kinsey broth
ers gave the former champions a hard
battle and it was only after the set had
run into twenty-two games that John
ston and Griffin were able to take the
match.
For his first match of the year. Jimmy
Davies showed up to good advantage.
Davies has one of the fastest drives on
the Coast today and, with a return of
his old form, should be able to take hi>
match with the Blue and Gold this year.
A heavy schedule is being planned for
next quarter, and, in addition to the
Ojai Valley tourney, the California
match, and the Pacific Coast Conference
tournament, several bouts with the lead
ing teams of the West are being ar
ranged.
