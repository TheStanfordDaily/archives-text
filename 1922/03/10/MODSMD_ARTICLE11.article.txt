tific, and philosophical lines that will
bring the desired results. Mr. Rowell
spoke of the frequent confusion of eco
nomic and moral judgments and the
necessity of recognizing both, and cited
Herbert Hoover as a man who is put
ting clear, economic thought into public
life.
"If training in universities can give
a fact-sense to challenge the existing
platitudes whose facts are smashing
against their theories there will be an
arousement in the university and out
side, to the immorality of crooked think
ing," said Mr. Rowell. He spoke of
Stanford's inherent spirit of simplicty
and its atmosphere of genuineness. "Its
straight-living and straight-thinking
should not only receive dedication here
each year, but also by spreading its vir
tues out for the hearing of the people,"
he concluded.
