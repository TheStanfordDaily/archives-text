# VARSITY BALL NINE LOSES TO ST. MARY'S AND IRELAND'S CLUB
## Madigan's Men Wallop Cards by 9 to 5 Margin; Cliff Takes Third Game 
### 
The Varsity baseball aggregation was
handed two decisive defeats in the two
games which it played on the local lot
Wednesday and Thursday afternoons.
On Wednesday the St. Mary's nine came
across the Bay for the first intercol
legiate game of the Cardinal schedule
and trounced Seay's men with a 9 to 5
score.
As a part of the Founders' Day pro
gram, Cliff Ireland invaded the campus
for the third time this season and took
away his third victory by a score of
3 to 1. This contest was the best base
ball show so far this season. Cliff had
practically a full lineup of Seals and
also brought Jim Scott along for good
measure. Scott was a mainstay for the
Seals last season in the chucking posi
tion. lie pitched three innings and then
Cliff thought lie had the' game cinched
and put Manouck in to finish.
Jim Clark did the hurling for the
Cards and, with the exception of the
third inning, when Kelly hit the pellet
out of the lot, he held a nine composed
of some of the best hitters on the Coast
completely in check. Clark's strikeout
boot}- was small, but he used his head
and pitched the type of ball which will
win more games than it loses. Holston,
one of the veterans on the Card catch
ing staff, donned the armor for Clark
and handled his job without a hitch.
Holston is a little weak with the stick
or he would have a regular berth on the
nine. Captain Green's knee gave him so
much trouble in the game against the
them, each one helped to put across a
most difficult play.
Matthew Tobriner showed admirable
reserve in a part that could easily have
been burlesqued, that of the "poppin
jay," Noel le Julys. Eva Williams as
Mather Villon won sympathy in spite of
her obvious youth. Lewis Hitchcock's
obsequiousness was as annoying to the
audience as it was to Villon, but other
wise his work was creditable. Dean
Ross was almost too villainous a villain
to be convincing, which was more the
fault of the atmosphere and the lines
created for him than of his acting.
Charles Parks stood out among the ruf
fians as a man to whom the campus may
look for future comedy parts.
In a few isolated spots the mob action
was natural and amusing, but it was gen
erally overdone and bordered danger
ously on the burlesque. Their laughter,
hisses, and bravos were at times ridicu
lously mechanical, unreal, and melodra
matic. Three weeks is too short a time
to perfect amateur mob action.
Technically, "If I Were King" did not
come up to expectations. Chrysella
Dunker's designs suffered from repro
duction in the second act under bright
lights, but the deep blues of the third
act improved them. The grewsome gib
bet silhouetted against the sunrise at
the opening of the fourth act was im
pressive. The warm coloring of the
tavern scene and the duel by lantern
light were pleasing effects in the open
ing act. The costuming showed care in
selection and made the stage intensely
colorful.
A ventriloquist trumpet and one or
two other ludicrous incidents brought
laughs when they were least desired
and reminded one that, after all, the
play was being presented by amateurs.

hisses, and bravos were at times ridicu
lously mechanical, unreal, and melodra
matic. Three weeks is too short a time
to perfect amateur mob action.
Technically, "If I Were King" did not
come up to expectations. Chrysella
Dunker's designs suffered from repro
duction in the second act under bright
lights, but the deep blues of the third
act improved them. The grewsome gib
bet silhouetted against the sunrise at
the opening of the fourth act was im
pressive. The warm coloring of the
tavern scene and the duel by lantern
light were pleasing effects in the open
ing act. The costuming showed care in
selection and made the stage intensely
colorful.
A ventriloquist trumpet and one or
two other ludicrous incidents brought
laughs when they were least desired
and reminded one that, after all, the
play was being presented by amateurs.
The Varsity baseball aggregation was
handed two decisive defeats in the two
games which it played on the local lot
Wednesday and Thursday afternoons.
On Wednesday the St. Mary's nine came
across the Bay for the first intercol
legiate game of the Cardinal schedule
and trounced Seay's men with a 9 to 5
score.
As a part of the Founders' Day pro
gram, Cliff Ireland invaded the campus
for the third time this season and took
away his third victory by a score of
3 to 1. This contest was the best base
ball show so far this season. Cliff had
practically a full lineup of Seals and
also brought Jim Scott along for good
measure. Scott was a mainstay for the
Seals last season in the chucking posi
tion. lie pitched three innings and then
Cliff thought lie had the' game cinched
and put Manouck in to finish.
Jim Clark did the hurling for the
Cards and, with the exception of the
third inning, when Kelly hit the pellet
out of the lot, he held a nine composed
of some of the best hitters on the Coast
completely in check. Clark's strikeout
boot}- was small, but he used his head
and pitched the type of ball which will
win more games than it loses. Holston,
one of the veterans on the Card catch
ing staff, donned the armor for Clark
and handled his job without a hitch.
Holston is a little weak with the stick
or he would have a regular berth on the
nine. Captain Green's knee gave him so
much trouble in the game against the
them, each one helped to put across a
most difficult play.
Matthew Tobriner showed admirable
reserve in a part that could easily have
been burlesqued, that of the "poppin
jay," Noel le Julys. Eva Williams as
Mather Villon won sympathy in spite of
her obvious youth. Lewis Hitchcock's
obsequiousness was as annoying to the
audience as it was to Villon, but other
wise his work was creditable. Dean
Ross was almost too villainous a villain
to be convincing, which was more the
fault of the atmosphere and the lines
created for him than of his acting.
Charles Parks stood out among the ruf
fians as a man to whom the campus may
look for future comedy parts.
In a few isolated spots the mob action
was natural and amusing, but it was gen
erally overdone and bordered danger
ously on the burlesque. Their laughter,
hisses, and bravos were at times ridicu
lously mechanical, unreal, and melodra
matic. Three weeks is too short a time
