# LABELING THE GAMES

### 
Basketball is fading from the scene almost as
rapidly as it made its entrance. A few passing re
marks about the prospects for next year, and the
sport is practically forgotten for another year. Which
is, perhaps, as it should be.
Yet few will deny that something has been ailing
with basketball at Stanford this year. For half a
decade past it has been gaining popularity, and with
a new pavilion, the stage was set for a banner season
in 1922. But expectations failed to materialize, and
there came instead an "off" year. An attendance of
700 persons at conference games here certainly does
not point toward anything that might be called a
"successful" year.
There are many probable causes for this state of
affairs, and any one of them would be difficult of
proof. Far more important, however, is the remedy,
so that the experience of the 1922 basketball season
shall not be repeated next year.
One suggestion tending toward the restoration of
basketball to its former standing is that there be a
reduction in the total number of games played on the
local courts. Four and five contests a week is a dish
upon which the average fan is easily fed up. Be
tween the varsity, freshman and weight teams, he is
easily surfeited with games to attend. With a less
heavy schedule, basketball games would become more
of events and less or ordinary occurrencesâ€”and that
is what the sport needs.
Moreover, unil there is a recognized method of
determining the champion of the Pacific Coast, inter
collegiate basketball will never enjoy anywhere near
the popularity of football and track. The logical
method of selecting the winner is through the Pacific
Coast Conference, yet in the past two basketball sea
sons that association has turned into a maze of uncer
tainty. The first step would be for all conference
teams to have a uniform number of games scheduled ;
ten, for instance. Any other contests necessary for
the proper training of the five would be labeled as
"practice" games.
The vagaries of the schedule, whereby Stanford
plays a so-called "weak" Northern team one year
and a strong one the next do not tend to heighten
interest in the game. One year let the Cardinal meet
the two Oregon teams on its northern trip, and let
California play the Washington fives. Then if pos
sible, let one Oregon and one Washington team come
south to meet both Stanford and California. The
following season, the opponents could be reversed.
Idaho, perhaps, would consent to play on a "home
and-home" basis, and a similar arrangement might be
made with Southern California. G. H. E.
