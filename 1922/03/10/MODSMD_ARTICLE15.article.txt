# CALIFORNIA-NEVADA CONFERENCE
## 
### 
The movement which has recently been started for
formation of a California-Nevada Intercollegiate
Conference to be made up of the smaller institutions
such as Santa Clara, St. Mary's, St. Ignatius, Ne
vada, College of Pacific, and Davis Farm would be
a very good thing for athletics of the Pacific Coast.
Such an organization would not only benefit the
colleges entering it, but it would also be a great help
to the Pacific Coast Conference. An organization of
the smaller colleges would bring them together on a
more even basis and under rules that would create a
better feeling among all the institutions. It will pro
mote athletic competition.
All the rules of the Pacific I oast C onference would
Ik* of benefit to the proposed organization with the

exception of the freshmen rule prohibiting iirst
vear men from competing on varsity teams. This
would of necessity have to lie disregarded because
these smaller institutions would not have the num
bers to pick their teams from that the larger uni
versities of the Pacific Coast Conference do.
A need for an organization of the smaller colleges
has been felt for many years, and now that the pre
liminary steps have been launched there is no reason
why a conference should not be formed.
