Because it is so near to the time when the various
faculty members begin thinking over their stock of
catch questions, and because of the arid space below
that must be filled, Cabbages appends herewith a list
of training rules to prepare the prospective candidates
for their examinations:
* * *
1. Begin, one week before your first examination, go
ing to bed at any old hour you please. See many
movies, eat anything you choose (and can).
2. Cut classes often. This given the prof the idea
that you are staying out to study, and is sure to make
a hit with him.
3. Rise fifteen minutes before breakfast. If you eat
at ten, rise at 9:45.
4. Before eating, dress neatly in your trousers and se
mester shirt, always remembering a black tie.(It comes
in handy for a pen-wiper).
5. Having dressed in haste and your school clothes,
run as far as possible before breakfast. This makes
the mind supple, and makes it easy to grasp the prob
lems of the day.
6. Follow these rules for a week and leave a stamped
and addressed envelope for your graduation certificate.

WHY DO THEY DO IT—AN EXPLANATION
It isn't the glamor,
Nor is it the clamor,
Of music or voices of girls,
It isn't the pleasure,
That isn't the measure,
Of dancing these intricate whirls,
And modern jazz dancing.
It is as entrancing,
As other things men can devise,
Most everyone knows it,
The reason he does it,
Is that it is good exercise!
♦ * ♦
Household hints. —To keep the spots from wearing
out of your rug: Get one with stripes in it.

Ode to a Jokesmith
We have rapped and we have pounded.
Thus our sheaves of verse compounded;
Tapping keys with llckle finger
While our thoughts on bedtime linger.
We have pondered, we have puzzled.
Wished our readers' comments muzzled,
Though we spend our hours in trying,
Our real talent lies in lying.
Yes, we've lived, prevaricated,
Had our knowledge estimated,
May Dame Fortune not malign us
Lest we draw that well-known minus!
We have types and we have written
By the poets' bug been bitten.
Here's a sample of our verses. . .
Lo! The buyers fill our purses!
We have snored and we have slumbered.
With a dream we've been encumbered;
What sad efforts one makes truly
When his fancy is unruly.
* * *
Capital punishment for this gent: He was told that
the decorations on the outside of the church were mo
saic work, and then he wanted to know where the bul
rushes were. (Students of Bible History conceded first
place on this deep one).

WHY DO THEY DO IT—AN EXPLANATION
It isn't the glamor,
Nor is it the clamor,
Of music or voices of girls,
It isn't the pleasure,
That isn't the measure,
Of dancing these intricate whirls,
And modern jazz dancing.
It is as entrancing,
As other things men can devise,
Most everyone knows it,
The reason he does it,
Is that it is good exercise!

Household hints. —To keep the spots from wearing
out of your rug: Get one with stripes in it.

Ode to a Jokesmith
We have rapped and we have pounded.
Thus our sheaves of verse compounded;
Tapping keys with llckle finger
While our thoughts on bedtime linger.
We have pondered, we have puzzled.
Wished our readers' comments muzzled,
Though we spend our hours in trying,
Our real talent lies in lying.
Yes, we've lived, prevaricated,
Had our knowledge estimated,
May Dame Fortune not malign us
Lest we draw that well-known minus!
We have types and we have written
By the poets' bug been bitten.
Here's a sample of our verses. . .
Lo! The buyers fill our purses!
We have snored and we have slumbered.
With a dream we've been encumbered;
What sad efforts one makes truly
When his fancy is unruly.

Capital punishment for this gent: He was told that
the decorations on the outside of the church were mo
saic work, and then he wanted to know where the bul
rushes were. (Students of Bible History conceded first
place on this deep one).

Because it is so near to the time when the various
faculty members begin thinking over their stock of
catch questions, and because of the arid space below
that must be filled, Cabbages appends herewith a list
of training rules to prepare the prospective candidates
for their examinations:
* * *
1. Begin, one week before your first examination, go
ing to bed at any old hour you please. See many
movies, eat anything you choose (and can).
2. Cut classes often. This given the prof the idea
that you are staying out to study, and is sure to make
a hit with him.
3. Rise fifteen minutes before breakfast. If you eat
at ten, rise at 9:45.
4. Before eating, dress neatly in your trousers and se
mester shirt, always remembering a black tie.(It comes
in handy for a pen-wiper).
5. Having dressed in haste and your school clothes,
run as far as possible before breakfast. This makes
the mind supple, and makes it easy to grasp the prob
lems of the day.
6. Follow these rules for a week and leave a stamped
and addressed envelope for your graduation certificate.
