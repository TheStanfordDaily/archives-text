# KEEP OUR BYWAYS CLEAN
## 
### 
With the warm weather we will have an in
creasing army of Sunday tourists on the campus.
At the entrance to Santa Clara County from San
Mateo there is a sign which should apply to us. It
is "Welcome to Santa Clara County; Help Us To
Keep Our Highways and Byways Clean." We can
help very much in the next few months to keep our
own byways clean when many picnickers are using
our campus as a place to spend the day. By keeping
constantly on the watch for careless ones who will
throw trash around and reminding them that they
are using the place free and owe us the courtesy of
keeping it clean we can make the arboretum look a
lot nicer to the passerby and make the work of tidying
u]) easier for the University authorities.
