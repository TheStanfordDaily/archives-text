singles player and a set of doubles will
enter from the freshman, sophomore,

thirty feet ranges. Coach Georgina
Burke put the finishing touches on the
teams yesterday with results of from
five to eight points an arrow. Helen
Meek, '23, and Anna Merrill, '25, are
expected to roll up the score for the
junior and freshman classes.
Coaches Edith Pasmore and Alice
Kendall have worked up some of the
best team work on class basketball teams
that Stanford has been able to claim in
'a long time. The final tournaments be
tween class teams have shown partic
ularly keen knowledge of technique on
the part of individual players. The soph
omore and senior squads have been the
most successful in the interclass compe
titions and will probably make a cred
itable showing against California.
Myra Waterman, '22, and Frances
Fish, '23, will uphold the upperclass
women in the tennis singles. Both
women have, proved their ability as
close-to-professional players in a long
list of previous tournaments and can be
relied upon for some expert work. Car
olyn Strouse, '25, and Katharine Ulrich,
'24, will enter the singles for the fresh
man and sophomore classes. They have
played steady, fast games throughout
the elimination tournaments and are
likely to surprise the California women.
The doubles have worked up good co
operation and will include such experi
enced racquet wielders as Elizabeth
Pierce, '24. Margaret Younglove, '22,
Virginia Burks, '23, Lucile Newmark,
'25, and Carolyn Pierce, '25.
The teams will be the guests of the
California women at lunch. The busses
are scheduled to leave Roble Gymnasium
at 7 a.m.
