# PERIOD DRAMA SHOWS GREAT STAGE ABILITY
## English Club Presentation of "If I Were King" Worthy of Professional Standards 
### Kenneth N. Stewart, '23 
Campus audiences have been educated
by Coacli Gordon Davis and clever tech
nicians to expect much of Stanford pro
ductions and to judge amateur efforts
by professional standards. In the main
they were not disappointed in Justin
McCarthy's "If I Were King," as pre
sented Wednesday night in the Assem
bly 11 all by English Club.
Lester Seib could not have had a
better vehicle with which to make his
farewell appearance here, and if anyone
doubted his exceptional ability as an
actor before Wednesday, he certainly
could not now. Seib faltered almost
imperceptibly once or twice, but the part
of Francois Villon called for a register
of almost every known emotion and the
mastery of extremely difficult and
lengthy speeches. Perhaps the con
fidence of the audience in his skill was
a psychological aid in tlie successful
characterization.
Stanford has at least two women cap
able of portraying something beyond the
usual charming, lovable, pretty but un
demanding "heroine" type. Violet An
drews and Helen Whitney proved this.
It is an accomplishment to impress a
student audience into admiring silence,
but Miss Whitney did it easily with her
beautiful death scene, which left noth
ing to be asked. To quote Robert
Benchley, "Xot being versed in the art
of intelligent enthusiasm, we can simply
say she was grand." Her seeming
superfluity of gesture and movement in
the first act may be attributed to the
nature of Huguette du Hamul.
Miss Andrews had a certain grace
and charm about her carriage and well
modulated voice which made merely her
presence on the stage pleasing. She was
at her best in her scornful moods and
the only time she did not make the most
of her possibilities was in her love scene
with Seib.
The only faults in Scherl Levy's char
acterization of Louis IX were those in
flicted by the author when the king's
spirit changed in the last act —which
was a triumph in the disappearing art
of melodrama. His gutteral chuckle was
the finishing touch in a historically and
dramatically consistent interpretation.
The program looked more like a stu
dent directory than a cast of characters,
and, although four stood out among
Saints that he did not enter yesterday's
contest.
Jim Kelly did the heaving for the
Varsity against the Saints on Wednes
day, and was able to hold his own until
the fourth inning. The visitors wal
loped out two triples and a double in
the fourth and scored three tallies.
Kelly never recovered, and they hit him
consistently until the eighth, when Net"
went in. And then they hit Xef.
George Green, Card skipper, who has
been out of the game since the beginning
of the season with an injured knee, did
the receiving against the St. Mary's nine
and did well, although his limp is still
with him and his arm has not limbered
up yet.
Ireland Game
The contest with Cliff's leaguers was
tight all the way through and if the
Cards had wielded the stick a little more
successfully the tale would have been
different, for their fielding was airtight
The three Ireland runs were made in
the third when Joe Kelly of the Seals
walloped the horsehide over the left
field fence and brought in Murray and
Scott.
In the second inning the Cards did
some professional bunting and base run
ning, and placed three men on the bases
with as many scratch hits. Parker and
Carver both scratched and beat it out.
Then Hcckendorf laid one of the niftiest
bunts down the third base that ever left
a bat. But Shades of Jupiter! Maillot
hit to Scott and they pulled a triple
play. The inning was over. The com
bination Scott to Powell to Bohne to
Powell was a deep one and showed pro
fessional finish.
In the ninth, with two down, Carver
hit a single to center and ! Icckendorf
followed with another to right. Ireland's
error let Carver come home for the
single Card marker.

Jim Kelly did the heaving for the
Varsity against the Saints on Wednes
day, and was able to hold his own until
the fourth inning. The visitors wal
loped out two triples and a double in
the fourth and scored three tallies.
Kelly never recovered, and they hit him
consistently until the eighth, when Net"
went in. And then they hit Xef.
George Green, Card skipper, who has
been out of the game since the beginning
of the season with an injured knee, did
the receiving against the St. Mary's nine
and did well, although his limp is still
with him and his arm has not limbered
up yet.
Ireland Game
The contest with Cliff's leaguers was
tight all the way through and if the
Cards had wielded the stick a little more
successfully the tale would have been
different, for their fielding was airtight
The three Ireland runs were made in
the third when Joe Kelly of the Seals
walloped the horsehide over the left
field fence and brought in Murray and
Scott.
In the second inning the Cards did
some professional bunting and base run
ning, and placed three men on the bases
with as many scratch hits. Parker and
Carver both scratched and beat it out.
Then Hcckendorf laid one of the niftiest
bunts down the third base that ever left
a bat. But Shades of Jupiter! Maillot
hit to Scott and they pulled a triple
play. The inning was over. The com
bination Scott to Powell to Bohne to
Powell was a deep one and showed pro
fessional finish.
In the ninth, with two down, Carver
hit a single to center and ! Icckendorf
followed with another to right. Ireland's
error let Carver come home for the
single Card marker.

Campus audiences have been educated
by Coacli Gordon Davis and clever tech
nicians to expect much of Stanford pro
ductions and to judge amateur efforts
by professional standards. In the main
they were not disappointed in Justin
McCarthy's "If I Were King," as pre
sented Wednesday night in the Assem
bly 11 all by English Club.
Lester Seib could not have had a
better vehicle with which to make his
farewell appearance here, and if anyone
doubted his exceptional ability as an
actor before Wednesday, he certainly
could not now. Seib faltered almost
imperceptibly once or twice, but the part
of Francois Villon called for a register
of almost every known emotion and the
mastery of extremely difficult and
lengthy speeches. Perhaps the con
fidence of the audience in his skill was
a psychological aid in tlie successful
characterization.
Stanford has at least two women cap
able of portraying something beyond the
usual charming, lovable, pretty but un
demanding "heroine" type. Violet An
drews and Helen Whitney proved this.
It is an accomplishment to impress a
student audience into admiring silence,
but Miss Whitney did it easily with her
beautiful death scene, which left noth
ing to be asked. To quote Robert
Benchley, "Xot being versed in the art
of intelligent enthusiasm, we can simply
say she was grand." Her seeming
superfluity of gesture and movement in
the first act may be attributed to the
nature of Huguette du Hamul.
Miss Andrews had a certain grace
and charm about her carriage and well
modulated voice which made merely her
presence on the stage pleasing. She was
at her best in her scornful moods and
the only time she did not make the most
of her possibilities was in her love scene
with Seib.
The only faults in Scherl Levy's char
acterization of Louis IX were those in
flicted by the author when the king's
spirit changed in the last act —which
was a triumph in the disappearing art
of melodrama. His gutteral chuckle was
the finishing touch in a historically and
dramatically consistent interpretation.
The program looked more like a stu
dent directory than a cast of characters,
