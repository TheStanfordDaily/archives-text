# PERIOD DRAMA SHOWS GREAT STAGE ABILITY
## English Club Presentation of "If I Were King" Worthy of Professional Standards 
### Kenneth N. Stewart, '23 
Campus audiences have been educated
by Coacli Gordon Davis and clever tech
nicians to expect much of Stanford pro
ductions and to judge amateur efforts
by professional standards. In the main
they were not disappointed in Justin
McCarthy's "If I Were King," as pre
sented Wednesday night in the Assem
bly 11 all by English Club.
Lester Seib could not have had a
better vehicle with which to make his
farewell appearance here, and if anyone
doubted his exceptional ability as an
actor before Wednesday, he certainly
could not now. Seib faltered almost
imperceptibly once or twice, but the part
of Francois Villon called for a register
of almost every known emotion and the
mastery of extremely difficult and
lengthy speeches. Perhaps the con
fidence of the audience in his skill was
a psychological aid in tlie successful
characterization.
Stanford has at least two women cap
able of portraying something beyond the
usual charming, lovable, pretty but un
demanding "heroine" type. Violet An
drews and Helen Whitney proved this.
It is an accomplishment to impress a
student audience into admiring silence,
but Miss Whitney did it easily with her
beautiful death scene, which left noth
ing to be asked. To quote Robert
Benchley, "Xot being versed in the art
of intelligent enthusiasm, we can simply
say she was grand." Her seeming
superfluity of gesture and movement in
the first act may be attributed to the
nature of Huguette du Hamul.
Miss Andrews had a certain grace
and charm about her carriage and well
modulated voice which made merely her
presence on the stage pleasing. She was
at her best in her scornful moods and
the only time she did not make the most
of her possibilities was in her love scene
with Seib.
The only faults in Scherl Levy's char
acterization of Louis IX were those in
flicted by the author when the king's
spirit changed in the last act â€”which
was a triumph in the disappearing art
of melodrama. His gutteral chuckle was
the finishing touch in a historically and
dramatically consistent interpretation.
The program looked more like a stu
dent directory than a cast of characters,
and, although four stood out among
