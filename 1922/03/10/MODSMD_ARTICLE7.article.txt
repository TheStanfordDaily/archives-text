## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton's incoming
crop of track athletes will Be subjected
to the scrutiny of the general public
for the first time this year in the annual
interclass meet, set for 1 :45 tomorrow
afternoon on the. Oval, weather condi
tions permitting.
At the same time the bleacherites are
giving the novices the critical "once
over"; the veterans will limber up and
provide the youngsters with some com
petition in the various events. It
shouldn't take long in the scramble for
class honors for the spectators to find
out just what talent Templcton has up
his sieve for the coming season.
Well over fifty entries ; re slated to
participate in the opening meet, somr.
forty of them being on the varsity
squad. The remainder are out for
places on the freshman team, and with
several exceptions are as yet just "pos
sibilities."
Despite their showing in the Irish
Marathon yesterday, the class of 1924
should make a strong bid for the inter
class championship. Hartranft and
Ludeke ought to clean up over ten
points in the discus and shot, with the
former placing in the 100. Then there
is Eddie Sudden, skipper of the 1924
babe squad; Coverly, and Macintosh.
Unless Morris Kirksey, the world's
"second fastest human," decides to com
pete, the combined senior holdover team
is not due to cut a very wide swath.
Gene Davis, Comstock, and Hays should
all place.
The juniors are the ones picked "bv
most of the track followers to give the
second-year men a race. The 1923 ag
gregation placed second to 1921 in the
affair last year. Lane Falk in the hur
dles, Bob Wright in the quarter, Howell
in the high jump, and Black in the pole
vault arc figured as sure point winners.
