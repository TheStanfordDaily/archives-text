# FOUNDERS' DAY OBSERVATION EVENTFUL
## Stanford Has Become More Than Name, Says Rowell, at Assembly 
### Bertha Vaughan, '22 
"Stanford has become more than a
personal name. The Stanford family
now means all of you, and every person
who has attended tlie institution. In
losing itself, it has found itself in a
great dedication to public service." This
was the tribute which Chester H. Row
ell paid to the University and its found
ers in his address at the assembly held
yesterday morning.
Mr. Rowell characterized Stanford as
one of the first and finest of endowed
universities. "There is no greater mon
ument than this University. It is the
fitting dedication of a great grief; a true
example of private wealth devoted to a
public movement."
"I he question of the usefulness of
the university today is the question of
whether it turns out men and women
who are useful to the people of the
state, said Mr. Rowell. "This means
the organized usefulness of an organized
university applied to an organized state."
Our great need today, lie pointed out,
is for a sense of fact-mindedncss to
counteract the existing crooked thinking,
and it is tlie development of the habit
of straight thinking in our universities
that will do away with the present
menace.
Mr. Rowell traced briefly the devel
opment of the American university from
its first form modeled after the British
College, to the time of the German and

other Continental influences which have
(resulted in our present type of institu
tion, which has absorbed elements from
all. He expressed the principal of the
American university in the words of the
founder of Cornell, "1 wish to found an
institution in which any person may
receive an education in any subject."
"It is the aim of our universities to be
a training place for students where they
may learn to do things with more suc
cess and more for public good," con
tinued Mr. Rowell. "but there should be
some method of bridging the present gap
between the government and the uni
versities. a war in which the investiga
tions of universities may receive prac
tical application."
Mr. Rowell pointed oiit that where the
problems of democracy were formerly
Vnoral, they are now intellectual. The
problem we face today is a new sort
of moral wrong—the immorality of illog
ical thinking. Mr. Rowell attributed
this condition in part to the large
amount of lawyer leadership in public
affairs, and the consequent temptation
of law to use argument for victory,
rather than investigation and truth.
"The lawyer has two ways of talking,"
said Mr. Rowell, "to the supreme court
and to the jury."
It is the doing away with this jurv
mindedness and the encouragement of
were presented, and decisive though
unnecessary action was taken on none of
them. Throughout the performance, the
work of the author and stage director
was in evidence.
A light between the sophomores and
the freshmen for third place furnished
the greatest excitement in the Mara
thon. In the first lap. the sophomores
dropped back of the yearlings, and by
the third, when the junior runners
passed the seniors' man for first, the
freshmen were a hundred yards ahead.
By the ninth round, the runners were
stretched out a fifth of a lap apart, but
in the twelfth Wheat started the sopho
mores' burst of speed, and Spencer and
Wood continued, so that the fifteenth
lap saw the babes left behind by fifty
yards. From then on the race was de
cided, although the seniors attempted a
comeback through the speed of. Bill
Comstock in the seventeenth relay.
The entire performance was staged
by Quadrangle Club, according to cus
tom. The profit or loss is always sus
tained by that organization.

"Stanford has become more than a
personal name. The Stanford family
now means all of you, and every person
who has attended tlie institution. In
losing itself, it has found itself in a
great dedication to public service." This
was the tribute which Chester H. Row
ell paid to the University and its found
ers in his address at the assembly held
yesterday morning.
Mr. Rowell characterized Stanford as
one of the first and finest of endowed
universities. "There is no greater mon
ument than this University. It is the
fitting dedication of a great grief; a true
example of private wealth devoted to a
public movement."
"I he question of the usefulness of
the university today is the question of
whether it turns out men and women
who are useful to the people of the
state, said Mr. Rowell. "This means
the organized usefulness of an organized
university applied to an organized state."
Our great need today, lie pointed out,
is for a sense of fact-mindedncss to
counteract the existing crooked thinking,
and it is tlie development of the habit
of straight thinking in our universities
that will do away with the present
menace.
Mr. Rowell traced briefly the devel
opment of the American university from
its first form modeled after the British
College, to the time of the German and

other Continental influences which have
(resulted in our present type of institu
tion, which has absorbed elements from
all. He expressed the principal of the
American university in the words of the
founder of Cornell, "1 wish to found an
institution in which any person may
receive an education in any subject."
"It is the aim of our universities to be
a training place for students where they
may learn to do things with more suc
cess and more for public good," con
tinued Mr. Rowell. "but there should be
some method of bridging the present gap
between the government and the uni
versities. a war in which the investiga
tions of universities may receive prac
tical application."
Mr. Rowell pointed oiit that where the
problems of democracy were formerly
Vnoral, they are now intellectual. The
problem we face today is a new sort
of moral wrong—the immorality of illog
ical thinking. Mr. Rowell attributed
this condition in part to the large
amount of lawyer leadership in public
affairs, and the consequent temptation
of law to use argument for victory,
rather than investigation and truth.
"The lawyer has two ways of talking,"
said Mr. Rowell, "to the supreme court
and to the jury."
It is the doing away with this jurv
mindedness and the encouragement of
were presented, and decisive though
unnecessary action was taken on none of
them. Throughout the performance, the
work of the author and stage director
was in evidence.
A light between the sophomores and
the freshmen for third place furnished
the greatest excitement in the Mara
thon. In the first lap. the sophomores
dropped back of the yearlings, and by
the third, when the junior runners
passed the seniors' man for first, the
freshmen were a hundred yards ahead.
By the ninth round, the runners were
stretched out a fifth of a lap apart, but
in the twelfth Wheat started the sopho
mores' burst of speed, and Spencer and
Wood continued, so that the fifteenth
lap saw the babes left behind by fifty
yards. From then on the race was de
cided, although the seniors attempted a
comeback through the speed of. Bill
Comstock in the seventeenth relay.
