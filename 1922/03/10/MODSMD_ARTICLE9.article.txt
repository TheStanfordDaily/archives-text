# CONCERT HONORS MEMORY OF UNIVERSITY FOUNDERS
## 
### Mary Jane Clark, '22 
Reverence to the memory of Stan
ford's founders was expressed in the
program given by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra in the Memorial
Church last evening as the conclusion
of a day devoted to commemorating
those who made the University possible.
The Memorial Church, filled with a
highly appreciative audience, formed an
impressive setting for the beauty of the
music which Alfred Hertz, noted con
ductor of the orchestra, had chosen for
the occasion. His numbers included
Brahms' "Second Symphony in D Ma
jor," a Rimsky-Korsakow overture;
"The Russian Easter," a Bach aria; and
the "Death and Transfiguration," by
Richard N Strauss, all of which were
highly in keeping with motive and sur
roundings.
The program was not only inspiring
in spirit, but added to this was the care
of interpretation and meticulous atten
tion to details of sdore by which Hertz
always adds to the effect of his con
certs. Certainly the Brahms "Sym
phony" with its four movements was a
test of this. These movements embody
a variety of orchestral expression from
soft, restful tones to stirring, profound
passages, and throughout the members
of the orchestra responded instantly to

the slightest demand made of them by
their conductor.
At the opening notes of the Brahms
number was suggested the fervor of its
main theme, which appeared in succeed
ing movements in marked variation. It
contained much that was lyric and melo
dious, but for the most part emphasized
a deeply religious feeling. The "Russian
Easter," which opened the second half,
was lillcd with brilliant climaxes, but
was of a different type from Brahms.
Particularly appealing was a passage
emphasized by the beauty of Persinger's
violin and a harp accompaniment played
by Kajetan Attl.
Bach's "Aria" from his "Suite Num
ber 3, 1) Major," was also spirited in
character, giving opportunity for force
ful interpretation and suggesting a cer
tain serenity in the grace of its more
subdued melody. "Death and Transfig
uration," by Strauss, remembered as an
inspiring finale to the Founders' Day
concert given by the Symphonists last
year, was a fitting close to last evening's
program. It is a vividly dramatic "tone
poem" which describes the death of a
man and his entrance into eternity, and
is a composition which leaves a linger
ing impression of the force and beauty
of the symphony.

main theme, which appeared in succeed
ing movements in marked variation. It
contained much that was lyric and melo
dious, but for the most part emphasized
a deeply religious feeling. The "Russian
Easter," which opened the second half,
was lillcd with brilliant climaxes, but
was of a different type from Brahms.
Particularly appealing was a passage
emphasized by the beauty of Persinger's
violin and a harp accompaniment played
by Kajetan Attl.
Bach's "Aria" from his "Suite Num
ber 3, 1) Major," was also spirited in
character, giving opportunity for force
ful interpretation and suggesting a cer
tain serenity in the grace of its more
subdued melody. "Death and Transfig
uration," by Strauss, remembered as an
inspiring finale to the Founders' Day
concert given by the Symphonists last
year, was a fitting close to last evening's
program. It is a vividly dramatic "tone
poem" which describes the death of a
man and his entrance into eternity, and
is a composition which leaves a linger
ing impression of the force and beauty
of the symphony.
