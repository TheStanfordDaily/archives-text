It's Now Readyâ€”
The New Display Counter Installed. Come and see the good baked
things in it.
We have been handicapped without a good place to
display the excellent cakes, pastries, pies and rolls
that we are supplying to the Stanford Cafe and other
restaurants. Now, with this new counter installed,
any shopper can come in and select the goodies to take
home that day. When you cannot visit our shop,
phone P.A. 387-J and we will promptly deliver your
order.
