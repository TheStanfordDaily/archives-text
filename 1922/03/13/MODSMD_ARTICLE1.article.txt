# GLENN HARTRANFT SMASHES RECORDS IN TRACK OPENER
## Sophomores Win Easily With Well Balanced Aggregation of Winners and Seconds 
### 
Two existing Stanford records went
into the discard Saturday afternoon as a
well-balanced sophomore team romped
away with the annual interclass track
meet. The seniors nosed out the juniors
for second place by one point, the score
board reading: sophomores, 44'/j; sen
iors, 31; juniors, 30; freshmen, 25j^.
Glenn Hartranft, '24, making his first
appearance in regular competition here,
monopolized the record-breaking. His
heave of 49 feet 6 inches in the shot bet
tered by nearly two feet the Stanford
record of 47 feet 8 inches, held by
"Here" Bihlman, and earned him a place
among the foremost intercollegiate shot
putters. Hartranft topped off the after
noon by tossing the discus 144 feet, shat
tering the Stanford mark of 135 feet,
and the Stanford-California record of
123 feet.
Five firsts and a goodly number of
second and third places won the affair
for the second-year men. Hartranft ac
counted for 13 points, and Sudden 10.
The juniors annexed four first places,
but lacked the small point winners.
Despite a soggy track, the marks
turned in sent the spectators away feel
ing that the preliminary showing of
Templeton's charges was more than sat
isfactory. Eddie Sudden, '24, the former
freshman speed burner, won the 100 in
10 fiat, and repeated in the 220 in 22:1
seconds.
Mint Howell, '23, cleared an even 6
feet in the high jump, and Bill Black,
'23, went 11 feet 6 inches in the pole
vault after the regular competition was
over.
Although the time was not exceptional,
the closest race of the afternoon was the
mile. For the four laps Charles, '25,
followed a pace behind his teammate,
Smith, and the pair rounded the final
curve neck and neck. In the last fifty
yards Smith uncorked a fast sprint and
won by ten yards.

Two existing Stanford records went
into the discard Saturday afternoon as a
well-balanced sophomore team romped
away with the annual interclass track
meet. The seniors nosed out the juniors
for second place by one point, the score
board reading: sophomores, 44'/j; sen
iors, 31; juniors, 30; freshmen, 25j^.
Glenn Hartranft, '24, making his first
appearance in regular competition here,
monopolized the record-breaking. His
heave of 49 feet 6 inches in the shot bet
tered by nearly two feet the Stanford
record of 47 feet 8 inches, held by
"Here" Bihlman, and earned him a place
among the foremost intercollegiate shot
putters. Hartranft topped off the after
noon by tossing the discus 144 feet, shat
tering the Stanford mark of 135 feet,
and the Stanford-California record of
123 feet.
Five firsts and a goodly number of
second and third places won the affair
for the second-year men. Hartranft ac
counted for 13 points, and Sudden 10.
The juniors annexed four first places,
but lacked the small point winners.
Despite a soggy track, the marks
turned in sent the spectators away feel
ing that the preliminary showing of
Templeton's charges was more than sat
isfactory. Eddie Sudden, '24, the former
freshman speed burner, won the 100 in
10 fiat, and repeated in the 220 in 22:1
seconds.
Mint Howell, '23, cleared an even 6
feet in the high jump, and Bill Black,

vault after the regular competition was
over.
