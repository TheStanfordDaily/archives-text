# FRESHMAN NINE IS 3-0 VICTOR OVER POLYTECHNIC HIGH
## 
### 
The freshman baseball nine took a
five-inning contest from the San Fran
cisco Polytechnic diamond aggrega
tion, Saturday afternoon, by a score
of 3 to 0. Santa Clara and the var- i
sity used the field at the end of five I
frames.
The Cardinal Babes showed "boil-;
siderable improvement, and played the
tightest game so far in the season.
No errors were chalked up against
the '25 men, and a beginning was
made at inside baseball. Heretofore
the yearling batters have faced the
opposing moundsmen with the main
idea of knocking the horsehide off the
sphere. Aydelott hurled a no-hit game
for the freshmen, and only one prep
man lifted the ball into the field. Six
strikeouts and three outs by way of
the pitcher to first base route com
pleted a very creditable five-inning
performance at the slab. Aydelotte
looks like a first-string man for the
Babe pitching staff.
The Cardinal stickers tried out their
swatting ability against "Dutch" Mat
zen who has the reputation of being
the best high school chucker in the
bay region. Matzen lived up to his
reputation and allowed only two hits,
and fanned six. "Dutch" represented
the majority of baseball art on the
Polytechnic team.
Coach Kallam changed the batting
line-up so that "Shorty" Roberts, who
covers the keystone territory, was
lead-off man, with Dick Lawson bat
ting third. Cuddeback retained his
position as clean-up hitter. The two
blows during the game were collected
by McCandless and Johnston, the lat
ter getting a double.
In the second inning, McCandless
home on a single by Green.
In the fifth inning Stanford took the
lead for the first time during the game.
With one out, Maillot cracked out a sin
gle and made second on a passed ball.
Peavy died out, but Carver hit the ball
for a two-bagger, bringing in Maillot
with the second tally.
Rallying in the sixth and last inning
of the game Santa Clara again tied the
score. Fitzpatrick got to first on a rield
er's choice and was advanced to second
on Clancy's walk. Logan followed with
a single which was enough to score Fitz
patrick with the tieing run with which
the game ended.
In their half of the sixth Stanford had
everything in their favor to take the lead
and consequently cinch the game. Rat
ner led off with a hard hit to left which
netted him two bases. Woodward went
in to run for Ratner and things surely
looked fine for the varsity. Wayland,
next man up, hit an infield grounder
which advanced Woodward to third.
Heckendorf drew the signal for a
squeeze play, but he failed to bunt, and
Woodward was caught off third and
tagged. Heckendorf drew a free pass
to first and went to third on a singh by
Green. Patterson was sent in as a pinch
hitter and drove out a fly to deep right
which the fielder easily got, ending the
game.

for a two-bagger, bringing in Maillot
with the second tally.
Rallying in the sixth and last inning
of the game Santa Clara again tied the
score. Fitzpatrick got to first on a rield
er's choice and was advanced to second
on Clancy's walk. Logan followed with
a single which was enough to score Fitz
patrick with the tieing run with which
the game ended.
In their half of the sixth Stanford had
everything in their favor to take the lead
and consequently cinch the game. Rat
ner led off with a hard hit to left which
netted him two bases. Woodward went
in to run for Ratner and things surely
looked fine for the varsity. Wayland,
next man up, hit an infield grounder
which advanced Woodward to third.
Heckendorf drew the signal for a
squeeze play, but he failed to bunt, and
Woodward was caught off third and
tagged. Heckendorf drew a free pass
to first and went to third on a singh by
Green. Patterson was sent in as a pinch
hitter and drove out a fly to deep right
which the fielder easily got, ending the
game.

The freshman baseball nine took a
five-inning contest from the San Fran
cisco Polytechnic diamond aggrega
tion, Saturday afternoon, by a score
of 3 to 0. Santa Clara and the var- i
sity used the field at the end of five I
frames.
The Cardinal Babes showed "boil-;
siderable improvement, and played the
tightest game so far in the season.
No errors were chalked up against
the '25 men, and a beginning was
made at inside baseball. Heretofore
the yearling batters have faced the
opposing moundsmen with the main
idea of knocking the horsehide off the
sphere. Aydelott hurled a no-hit game
for the freshmen, and only one prep
man lifted the ball into the field. Six
strikeouts and three outs by way of
the pitcher to first base route com
pleted a very creditable five-inning
performance at the slab. Aydelotte
looks like a first-string man for the
Babe pitching staff.
The Cardinal stickers tried out their
swatting ability against "Dutch" Mat
zen who has the reputation of being
the best high school chucker in the
bay region. Matzen lived up to his
reputation and allowed only two hits,
and fanned six. "Dutch" represented
the majority of baseball art on the
Polytechnic team.
Coach Kallam changed the batting
line-up so that "Shorty" Roberts, who
covers the keystone territory, was
lead-off man, with Dick Lawson bat
ting third. Cuddeback retained his
position as clean-up hitter. The two
blows during the game were collected
by McCandless and Johnston, the lat
ter getting a double.
In the second inning, McCandless
home on a single by Green.
In the fifth inning Stanford took the
lead for the first time during the game.
With one out, Maillot cracked out a sin
gle and made second on a passed ball.
Peavy died out, but Carver hit the ball
for a two-bagger, bringing in Maillot
with the second tally.
