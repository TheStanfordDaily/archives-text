# FRESHMEN SWIMMERS DEFEAT BRUIN SQUAD
## Chittenden Plunges Sixty-Eight Feet, Breaking Record for Event 
### 
The Cardinal freshmen swimming
team outswam the California Babes in
their annual contest, 35-33, in Encina
pool Saturday afternoon.
Two records were broken and one was
tied. Chittenden won first place for the
Cards in the plunge and added eight feet
to the former plunging record, making
the new mark 68 feet 5 inches. Rosen
baum captured second place for the
Card babes and he too went farther than
the old mark. Jim Carson, swimming
for the Blue and Gold babes, found little
difficulty in lowering the 220-yard free
style record by 7:1 seconds, making
2 :51:2.
Captain Klebahn pulled the surprise of
the day when he snowed his heels to
Carson and Rau of California in the 50-
yard free style and tied the record of
26 :4 seconds. He has been making good
time in all preliminary meets but had
not counted upon capturing more than
a second place against these more ex
perienced swimmers.
Gibbons and Straube proved to be
too clever for the Bruin entries in the
fancy diving and gave a better exhibition
of their skill in this meet than in any
of the preliminary contests.
In water polo the Cardinal first-year
team also showed their superiority over
their California opponents when they
defeated them by a score of Bto 5. Mc-
Callister proved himself to be a star
water polo player by making five of the
Cardinal goals besides playing a good de
fensive game. Carson, who was a mem
ber of the United States water polo team
at the Olympic Games, was easily the
star of the Bruin aggregation, but was
closely guarded.
The Cardinal water polo team was com
posed of Myers, McCallister, Wright,
Belcher, Hubbard, Graham, and Am
brose.
