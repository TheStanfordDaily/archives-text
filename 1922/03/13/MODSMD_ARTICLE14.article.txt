# COACH SEAY'S MEN PLAY 2 TO 2 TIE WITH SANTA CLARA
## Game in Doubt Until Last Out is made; Thrills Furnished in Final Inning by Cards 
### 
A battle royal was staged on the
Freshman diamond Saturday afternoon
when the Santa Clara aggregation played
the varsity nine to a 2 to 2 tie, the game
being called at the end of the sixth in
ning on account of the late start. The
game took place on the Freshman field,
due to the muddy condition of the var

The contest was tight all the way
through, the score standing at 1 -all up
to the fifth frame, when Stanford took
the lead, only to be again tied in Santa

home men were unable to put across the
winning run.

the Cards and with the exception of the
second inning when Fitzpatrick clouted
the pellet for a home run over the left
field fence, he held the visitors to four
scattered hits. His strikeout tally was
only four, but he showed himself able
to tighten up effectively in the pinches.
Green did the receiving for Loewenstein.
Gondales occupied the mound for the
Santa Clarans, and was nicked for seven
hits by the Cardinal batsmen. Fitzpat
rick did the catching for Gonzales and
looked to be a real baseball player, get

tally for Santa Clara. As usual, Caesar
Manelli, all around athlete and mainstay
of the Santa Clara College, was present
in the line-up and played center field for
the visitors.
The first run of the game came in the
second inning when Fitzpatrick hit a
long fly to left which cleared the fielder's
head and bounced over the fence, allow
ing him a complete trot around the bags.
The varsity came back in their halt'
of the second and tied the score when
"Lefty" Heckendorf, after getting a free
pass to first and stealing second, came
