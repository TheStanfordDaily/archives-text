"If religion means to hear sermons
and to pass resolutions, without taking
active steps to change undesirable con
ditions, then perhaps religion may be
considered an opiate," said Mr. Edward
T. Devine, editor of the Survey Maga
zine, in the Memorial Church Sunday
morning in his talk, "Is Religion an
Opiate?" "But I doubt," he continued,
"if such may truly be called a religion,
or its people be called Christians,'
According to Mr. Devinc, Lenin had
inscribed upon the walls of a Moscow
church these words, "Religion is a drug
that makes people contented with things
that ought to be changed." Whether or
not there is justification for such a view
depends, in Mr. Devine s opinion, upon
the definition one gives to the word "re
ligion."' If it means an artificial escape
from the realities of life, then Lenin has
some reason for this belief. But "true
religion" means ceaseless efforts to
change and rectify undesirable condi
tions, and Mr. Devine expressed tlic be
lief that the churches of today are in
creasingly accepting this view of religion.
