# A
						MATTER OF RESPECT

### 
Action of the California Student Council was in
voked and a general feeling of disgust caused by the
drunks who made merry at the expense of the women
at the Prytanean h ete on the Berkelev campus, The
matter went into the columns of the city papers and
was widely copied as good feature news for the press.
This is fine for the reputation of California when the
parents of prospective students read of the "drunken
orgies held by college boys," and other choice bits of
news. Why it is so attractive to publicity for a col
lege man to get drunk is a matter of heavy interest.
But the fact stands nevertheless that the college man
is in the limelight immediately upon doing anything
of a nature which would excite no more than a pass
ing comment if the wrongdoer were a mere taxpayer
or common citizen. There is something alluring
about that name "collegiate" which adds glamor to
an otherwise tame event and makes the press play it
up to the limit. And as it is the bad which receives
most important place it tends to put the university
person in an ill repute.
In regard to drunkenness, the hysteria over the
advent of prohibition and its resultant siege of hard
drinking by many who had never taken more than an
occasional beer has not stopped in spite of confident
assertions made two years ago that abstinence would
soon be a forced reality. We see today, certainly not
so many people drinking because the saloon is gone
from the gaze of the casual passerby, but there still
exists an unending supply of liquor, hard and mild,
good and bad. The maker of it is violating the con
stitution of the United States every day, and we
who buy illicit wet goods are helping him to com
pound a felony every time we buy a bottle of "corn"
or beer. The main thing is that we do not look at it
in this light, for the average citizen is not a man who
will countenance for a minute infractions of the laws
of the country if he really thinks soberly upon the
case. We simply take this part of the constitution as
a joke, for the most part, and go ahead with our little
brawls without a thought to the consequences.
W'hether drink is bad or not is not the matter for
our first consideration here on the farm. The evil
is proven and so is accepted or cast aside as we
choose, at our peril. But here we are a compact body
of men and women, thrown of necessity into more or
less intimacy. If the men drink and then come
around where the women are there is a direct insult
to the women because the sentiment against liquor,
held now by the public, cheapens the association of
a woman who condones drinking in public places.
Our women here, in spite of the criticism that is made
of them, rate the treatment as ladies as long as they
comport themselves as such. They do not like the
presence of liquor in the great majority of cases, and
they feel themselves lowered and embarrased when
they are seen with a man whose breath smells of
liquor. If we care enough about them to take them
out, we owe them respect and the duty of keeping
away from liquor while in their presence.
