An encouraging example of the kind of interest
being taken by the women in the pageant they are to
give next quarter is the offer the Woman's Economic
Club has made to raise the $200 needed for music
and orchestra. The selling of little Good Luck dolls
during examination week, similar to the "Phi Bet
seys" sold during the fateful season last year, will be
the first step taken by the organization in raising the

funds necessary for the music, an important part in
the pageant.
The significance of the offer is even more note
worthy, for it is this kind of support that will make
this first pageant a real achievement. The produc
tion of a masque to rank with those now being given
at leading institutions of learning throughout the
country is no slight undertaking by any means; it
requires support from all sides and genuine enthusi
asm to carry it to a successful conclusion.
The work so far accomplished has shown the
women alive to their responsibility in making some
thing worth while of this first production. It is to
become an annual or biennial event. Accordingly, it
is to set a standard for future pageants, and as such
merits an all-five-hundred support.
