# "THE MANLY ART"

### 
The class of bouts put on Saturday night by the
Stanford and California boxers left everyone with a
completely satisfied feeling at the end of the card
and showed the crowd that interest in the minor
sports is not on the wane in any way. All the
matches were fought hard by both contestants, and
the men were gluttons for punishment. The crowd
that turned out to witness the fights would have
done credit to any major sport contest. Interest
shown last Saturday night will be a big stimulus
toward larger participation in minor athletics, and
a resulting help to the lesser sports.
