# CARDINAL SOCCER TEAM WINS TITLE IN U. AND C. LEAGUE
## 
### 
When the Unione Sportiva Italiana
Club failed for the third consecutive
time to meet the Cardinal soccer team
in a regular scheduled meet, the Sportiva
Club automatically forfeited the game
and the Stanford players became the
champions of the University and Club
League. This was to be the final game
of the season for the varsity, and while
the betting odds were in favor of the
Cards, the loss of the game would have
again tiyflNlaloney's men and the Olym
pic Club/buch a game was anything but
sought by the Stanford squad, as the
Olympics can now draw upon the men
in the San Francisco Sunday League.
On the whole, the teams in the league
were evenly matched. The Stanford
aggregation had seven victories, four
tied games, and only one defeat, while
the Olympic Club was the closest con
testant for the title with live games won,
four tied, and two lost.
The old dope bucket was continually
tipped over. The Palo Alto American
Legion was the only team that succeeded
in defeating the varsity, and at that, the
line-up contained men who did not act
ually belong to the Palo Alto post. The
Barbs proved to be the jinx for the
Olympic Club. In their last scheduled
game they downed the Olympics 2-1,
thus breaking the Stanford and Olympic
tie. The California eleven also added its
share with a result that Stanford won
the league championship, with the
Winged-O placing second. The Palo
Alto Legion, Barbarians, and the Bears
placed in the order given.
By winning first place in the league
the varsity players will be awarded gold
medals besides winning the third leg on
a trophy given by Spalding's of San
Francisco.
