At enormous cost, Cabbages secured a special re
porter to cover the fisticuffs last Saturday p.m., and
takes some pleasure and more space in presenting his
offerings.
* * »
Offering No. 1. —K. O. Noktout, representing U. C.,
shook hands with O. K. Kidd of L. S. J. U. The bout
commenced. Immediately it seemed that Kidd was the
man who knocked "out" out of bout. There was nothing
left by the "B," so the spectators booed about a bit
for a bout they thought there was going to be. The
referee called a foul after three raises and threw his
hand into the discards, thus disposing Einstein's theory
of limits. The judges decided in favor of a draw and
the referee took two. At the gong, Noktout was hunting
for the ace under the canvas.

Offering No. 2. —Jack S. Dempsey, substituting for
N. O. Body, of trans-bay fame, came to blows with U. B.
Damd of local eminence soon after the fight commenced*
Jack led with his right and the trainers led him out of
the ring a couple of minutes later. Jack said he'd spent
his whole life in a Gym, but he never before knew that
dumbbells had such a funny ring. He seemed grieved
that Nature didn't finish her work in 1906.

Third acceptance—Dark Horse of Cal. tried to ram
Battle Shipp of the Cards, who showed him spades.
The Cal. trainer had one ready at the end of the second
round. After several seconds of industrious milling,
Horse decided he couldn't recover on the existing
grounds. Upon the referee's inquiry as to whether he
was curious to see what else Shipp had aboaid, Horse
replied, "Neigh, Neigh!" The fans stirred up breezy
comment.

Fourth or thereabouts —I. Black of Holy Berkeley
Eye gave an Oski Wow Wow and a typical Bruin grunt
when Muddy Lane, who swings haymakers for the
"Farm" got the idea that the sun was shining. After
four failures to submarine Lane, Black started an aerial
attack. While passing through an air pocket, he started
a tail spin that ended in a nose dive. He took flight at
the end of the third.

Fifth ditto —Work Hard of Stanford proved his mettle
when he played the "Anvil Chorus" on the Iron man
from Cal. He did plenty o£ hammering in the first,
forged ahead in the second and brought forth a few
bellows in the third. Hard is an earnest workman and
believes in polishing off all piece-work. His opponent
contributed the remark that if Hard called that peace
work, he'd hate to see any war. Hard declared that
even if he did show his mettle, the decision wasn't a
steal. The fans waved again.
♦ * *
Sixth verse—Dollar Bills of the Red-shirts paid an
old debt to I. O. Whoo, representing the California
School of Stadiums, in the first round of their mitt tiff.
Whoo aimed one at Bills, but the magazine jammed
and Bills banked one off Whoo's midriff. Whoo har
vested a mean crop of applause when he clapped his
pruning hook in Bills' Adam's apple. Bills repaid him
with interest. The referee sneezed and Whoo, thinking
it was the gong, started for his corner. He arrived be
tween two friends. The fans gave Bills the Palm.

Seventh Item —Ima Fientiemer consistently covered
his blushes when he got into the ring with Gimme
Boss, of Red renown. There must have been a plain
clothes in the crowd looking for Fientiemer, judging by
the way he kept his dukes over his mug. The judges
thought he'd dropped a niekle on the floor and was
shading his eyes while he looked for it. Perhaps it is
just as well. He was glad enough of the chance to sit
on a dime when the first round was over. The referee
solicitously inquired if any of the rest of the dishes
were broken when Boss cracked Fientiemer's mug in
the third. The fans came in handy during the hot parts
of the bout.

Eighth—(Flash)—Announcement from Cal.—That a
stadium was to be erected in Raspberry Canyon before
1937 resulted in an abrupt exodus of all Blue and Gold
box fighters. Carrying their wounded, the Bruins retreat
ed from the field in a cloud of eight-ounce gloves. As
the blow fell, the fans got the air.

A SHOT IN THE MUG IS WORTH TWO IN THE
JUG. -
