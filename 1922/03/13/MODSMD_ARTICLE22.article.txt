The Wilson Foundation is setting a
new example in not making personal so
licitation for funds. It invites subscrip
tions but leaves the question of subscrib
ing or not, and of the amount, entirely to
the individual.
Students and faculty members, having
had so many demands on the purse, are
inclined to feel they have already done
all that could be expected. They are
probably right. And yet it seems a pity
not to have some part in this under
taking to further the very highest inter
ests of our democracy. When it is es

tablished and at work, it will be con
siderable satisfaction to be able to say,
'I helped set that going."
People have different opinions about
the methods and specific policies of
Woodrow Wilson, but almost everyone
agrees that he cherished noble ideals,
and that he has made great sacrifices for
them. It is these ideals which have been
the inspiration of the Foundation and
which have drawn free-will offerings
from people in all parts of the country,
and of every shade of political belief.
The opportunity of having a hand in
this service to the world is now pre
sented to us. Shall we pass it by?
JEFFERSON ELMORE.
