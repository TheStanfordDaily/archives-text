BRITAIN FACES A CRISIS
1 he Lloyd George government seems
to be tottering badly. The troubles in
India, following on the arrest of Gandhi;
the revolt in South Africa; disturbances
in Ireland; and finally, visible instabil
ity in the cabinet itself apparently pres
age a general election, and a realignment
of parties in Great Britain. The Labor
ites are preparing to get control. The
trouble with all the parties appears to
be the lack of a man to substitute Lloyd
George.
IN THE U. S. SENATE
With McCormick, Democrat, and
Lodge, Republican, supporting the four
power pact the irreconcilables are in for
a drawn battle. Lodge's attempt to force

debates is bringing the matters to a head
and an early vote may therefore be ex
pected.
IN THE BALKANS
An explosion in the garden of the
United States legation in Sofia, Bulgaria,

investigate the matter. The troubles in
Fiume continue to cause much uneasi
ness in the political circles in Italy and
Serbia. The news about the disturb
ances is very scanty.
