# Students May Report Scholarship Handicaps
## 
### 
Students who have been ill during
the present quarter or who have
otherwise been interrupted in their
work and who fear that their marks
may be such as to cause some scholar
ship action, may report the special
circumstances to Miss McKendry,
secretary of the committee, any after
noon this week between 1 :30 and 4 :30.
Miss McKendry may be found in
Room 5 of the Law Building. The
committee meets Saturday to con
sider these excuses and therefore all
must be in by Friday at 4 :30.
