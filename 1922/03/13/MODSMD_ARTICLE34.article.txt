Hide the guide-book! Snow!
'Sno use, Mr. B. A. Booster, the
weather man is like Death—you can't
beat him. As the press agent might
phrase it, however, a bona tide Arctic
blizzard raged on the campus for no less
than two consecutive minutes last Satur
day afternoon, imported at great expense
and tribulation.
Crystal after crystal of genuine snow
of the finest water fell, commencing
about 2:01 and continuing until 2:03, or
thereabouts. In spite of the marvelous
precipitation, no unusual number of
frozen pipes, deaths from exposure, dis
asters due to falling icicles, broken
limbs (trees or otherwise), and the like
were reported. Although all telegraph
and telephone wires remained a- before,
unhandicapped, investigation has re
vealed 110 cases of lost wayfarers other
than the usual quota of vagrants.
After all, it is not very strange, for,
great as the quantity was that fell, the
snow remained on the ground, unmelted,
but a few seconds.
