# "LUCKY DOLLS" TO BE SOLD FOR PAGEANT EXAMINATION WEEK
## 
### 
Good luck talismcn, known as "Cum
Laudes," and similar to the "Phi Betsy"
dolls sold during examination week last
year, will be sold by the Women's Eco
nomics Club next week in order to raise
funds for the women's spring pageant.
The arrangement of a musical score
and the necessity of having additional
pieces to supplement the University or
chestra will amount to about $200, it is
estimated by the pageant committee, and
the Women's Economics Club at a recent
meeting voted in favor of raising the
necessary funds for this purpose. The
sale of lucky charms during examination
week will be the first effort of the or
ganization in this direction.
