Club team held the lead and finished
about seven feet ahead of the Pacific
City team. Throughout the entire
race the Cardinal team and the Pacific
City team raced neck and neck. It
was not until the last lap that Jorgen

nosed out Austin of the Cards by
about six inches.

fanoy diving for the Cardinal and
showed that he is capable of a per
formance which will soon earn him a
nosition among the leading divers of

that has been seen at Stanford this
year. With the exception of one dive
when he failed to turn kuickly enough
he excelled in every trial. He won
first place by a good margin over Pat
terson of the Oolympic Club who is
recognized as one of the leading div
ers of the Pacific Coast. Don Sned

work. Clarence Pinkston, present
world's champion diver and former

thriller. Jack Howell, of the Olympic

career and was only defeated by his
veteran opponent by about five 'feet.

outswimming four other contestants.

mer and Pacific Coast champion took
first in the 220 yard free style but had
strong opposition in his team-mate

cut down Smith's lead.

a close contest between Austin of
the Cardinal team, and Gardner of the

advantage until the last turn when
the club swimmer evened up matters.
