# STANFORD WOMEN ARCHERS WIN IN TRI-COLLEGE MEET
## Local Teams Win Laurels from Mills Entries; Break Even With California in Tennis 
### 
Stanford women made the best of
their chances in the tri-college meet
Saturday, on the Berkeley campus,
when they looted ten out of thirteen
places in the archery contest with
Mills and broke even with California
in tennis. The basketball games
scheduled with California were called
off on account of rain that ruined the
California court for play %
Although the Cardinal archers did
not come up to expectations based
on the practice average of four and
five points an arrow, they managed
to spear first, second and third places
in the sophomore and junior matches.
Wanda Leach, '22, made the highest
score of the day at 70' points; ten ar
rows shot at the 40 yard range, score
36, and ten at the 30 yards, score 34.
Elizabeth Coffeen of Mills took the
senior second place by a score of 57.
Margaret Olson, '22, concluded the '22
class match with 47 points for Stan
ford.
Julia Spears punctured the bull's
eye a few times and rolled up 63 po
ints for first place in the junior meet.
Helen Meek, '23, followed close in
second place, score 62. Her shots
were straight and forceful but she did
not get into her usual accurate aim.
Elizabeth Lawrence brought in 58 po
ints at third, having aimed well at
some good centers.
The underclasses shot ten arrows
at thirty yards only. Sarah McCann
took first place by a large margin
in the sophomore contest; score 29.
The Mills women were still unable to
mount scores and Stanford captured
second and third positions; Katharine
Calhoun scored 22 points, followed
by Ruth Newlin at third,
The freshman team had a harder
time of it, the Mills team tieing Anne
Marrill's score of 26. Mills carried
off second place, score 21. Madeline
Ziller made third by 16 points. Snow
began to fall during the freshman
meet, making the shooting non-repre
sentative of either team.
Stanford has three single matches
and one double to claim of the class
tennis tournaments with California.
Singles were won by freshmen, juni
or and senior teams, while Marion
Echols, '22, and Margaret Younglove,
'22, defeated the California senior
doubles team, 6-2, 6-3.
Myra Waterman, '22, made the senior
singles tournament the fastest and most
interesting of the afternoon, winning it
from llene Taylor by a score of 6-2, 6-3.
She kept the lead over her opponent
throughout the match with strong drives
and clever placing of balls. The charac
teristic '"Waterman" serve more than
once baffled the California woman and
was the most dangerous weapon used in
winning the sets.
The junior tournament was a close
rival to the senior in interest. Frances
Fish, '23, played her best and won;
score, 6-4, 6-8. The contestants were
well matched, which brought out the
prettiest work possible from both. Miss
Fish was at all times in position to re
ceive difficult drives, putting up a par
ticularly strong defense. She displayed
some keen knowledge of tennis technique
in forward and backhand strokes. Irma
Gutsch, '23, and Virginia Burks, '23, lost
to the California junior doubles team;
score, 6-1, 6-1.
Elizabeth Peirce, '24, substituting for
Katharine Ulrich, '24, in the sophomore
singles, bucked up against the coast
champion player, Anna McCune of Cali
fornia. She played a steady game but
could not prove herself a match for her
more experienced opponent. The per
fection of style and excellence of drives
exhibited by the champign cannot be dis
puted. The results of the match arc 6-0,
6-1. The sophomore doubles team, con
sisting of Dorothy Ehrhorn and Anita
Kerr, was defeated by a score of 6-2, 6-3.
Carolyn Strouse, '25, played to the ut
most of her ability and took the fresh
man singles by scores of 6-4, 6-1. Her
game was featured by steady accuracy
at placing, and swift serves. The fresh
man doubles team consisting of Carolyn
Peirce and Lucile Newmark lost the
match; score, 6-2, 6-3.
