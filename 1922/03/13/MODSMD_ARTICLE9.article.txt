# Varsity Boxers Win Five of Nine Bouts
## Jimmie Ross Wins Feature Bout by Outclassing Bennie Einzig 
### D.E. Liebendorfer, '24 
Before the largest crowd that ever witnessed a boxing tournament on the
campus, the Cardinal boxers won two of three exhibition bouts and three of
six regular matches from the Blue and Gold pugilists in the pavilion Satur
day night. The bouts without exception were fast and hard fought and the
enthusiasm of the fans was at a high pitch during the entire evening.
In the first exhibition bout of the evening, Abe Rubin, won the decision
over Jack Fishburn in the lightweight class. The match was a good one for
an opener as both men were willing mixers. The first round ended with
neither man getting the advantage. The second opened with a fast exchange
of blows at close range. Rubin's blows were particularly effective in the fre
quent clinches, and the round was his by a shade. The third round found
Fishburn on the defensive, with Rubin landing the majority of blows.
Walt Bills, the heavy hitting Card welterweight won his exhibition match
from Bernie Garcia, in spite of the fact that Garcia entered the ring at the

sound of the first gong with murder
in his eye. Garcia "came in like a lion
and went out like a lamb." By the
time that he came down to earth, the
first round was half over, but enough
time remained for Bills to pile up a
good lead. In the second round Gar
cia still pursued his wild man tactics
with the same disastrous results to
himself. Bills' blows landed consist
entlye and repeatedly battered his
opponent to the ropes under a shower
of rights and lefts. Bills displayed
the same coolness and ring general
ship in the third round and no one was
surprised at the decision of the judges.
Jack Moran, the California welter
weight who was selected to meet
Johnnie Lane in the third exhibition
match certainly earned the title of
"One Punch Moran." He depended
during the entire bout on a left hook
to the-body delivered as he bore in on
Lane. Lane was equal to the occasion,
however, and met every rush with a
storm of lefts and rights. The first
round went to Lane. In the second
Lane landed blows at will and piled up
a still greater lead. Moran landed
effective blows for the first time in the
third round but Lane's lead was too
great and he won the decision.
Sol Silverman, who was one of the
two California men to win matches
against Stanford last year, put Tommy
Bowles away in a minute and thirty
five seconds of fighting. For a few
seconds it looked as if Bowles might
be able to give the little California
fighter a good battle, but Silverman
staggered Bowles with a shower of
blows and finally knocked him out
with a left to the body and a right to
the jaw. Silverman is one of the best
bantam weights seen here in some
time.
George Long, the highly touted light
weight from across the bay, who was
scheduled to meet Kenny Shipp, was
unable to compete because of sick
ness, and Coach Jones unexpectedly
substituted George Allen, a negro,
contrary to a previous agreement be
tween Stanford and California, when
the color line was drawn. Shipp made
short work of Allen, however. The
first round was slow, neither man
landing any blows that did any dam
age. In the second round Shipp open
ed up and landed a series of blows
that staggered Allen. Allen was
groggy as the round ended and the
bell alone saved him from a knock
out. The third round was a repeti
tion of the second. Allen being saved
from a knockout when the referee
stopped the bout and gave the decision
to Shipp. Shipp has developed a left
which is almost an dangerous as his
right, and he made both of them count
Saturday night. He fought the best
bout of his career and he may be
looked to for more good performances.
Bennie Einzig, who knocked out his
Davis Farm opponent in ten seconds
two weeks ago, a better man in
Jimmie Ross. Ross carried the fight
to his opponen at all times and could
not induce Einzig to the lead. Both
men 4vere wary in the first round, with
Einzig clinching repeatedly. This
round was close with Ross having a
shade on his opponent. The second
round was a draw, both landing many
blows. In the final round Ross better
ed Einzig to the ropes repeatedly and
the California star was forced to clinch
many times. His win over Einzig
stamps Ross as the best light weight
in college boxing on the Pacific Coast.
Bill Burkhard won from Walt Robin
son in the welter weight class in the
fastest bout of the evening. Both
men started early in the first round
and there was plenty of action at all
times. The first round was Burkhard's
after a fast exchange of blows. In
the second. Burkhard's left found its
mark repeatedly on Robinson's body
and head. Robinson countered with
lefts and rights to the head, but the
round went to Burkhard by a shade.
Burkhard led all the way in the third
and he was given the decision.
Jimmy Cline, the California star who
had previously been declared inelig
ible, failed to shine in his bout with
"Husky" Wassum. Last year, Murphy
was accused of slowing up his fight
with Cline by clinching. Cline seems
to have learned something from Mur
phy if this is the case, for he put
up one of the cleverest exhibitions of
stalling, Saturday night, that has ever
been seen here. He clinched and held
at every opportunity during the en
tire bout and was given an unpopular
decision. Wassum showed that Cline
could be hit and hit hard. The first
round was Wassum's by a shade, and
the second went to Cline, with the
third a draw. A draw decision would
have been fair to both men.
Bob Crowley won from Mark Evans
in the final bout of the evening.
Crowley failed to show much, but
Evans was not in shape to give him
a hard battle and Crowley stalled
throughout the bout, landing blows
occasionally, and finally winning the
decision.
Stanford forfeited to California in
he heavyweight class, because Jim
Arthur, Card heavy, injured his hand
in practice.

champion of the world, refereed the

with the same disastrous results to
himself. Bills' blows landed consist
entlye and repeatedly battered his
opponent to the ropes under a shower
of rights and lefts. Bills displayed
the same coolness and ring general
ship in the third round and no one was
surprised at the decision of the judges.
Jack Moran, the California welter
weight who was selected to meet
Johnnie Lane in the third exhibition
match certainly earned the title of
"One Punch Moran." He depended
during the entire bout on a left hook
to the-body delivered as he bore in on
Lane. Lane was equal to the occasion,
however, and met every rush with a
storm of lefts and rights. The first
round went to Lane. In the second
Lane landed blows at will and piled up
a still greater lead. Moran landed
effective blows for the first time in the
third round but Lane's lead was too
great and he won the decision.
Sol Silverman, who was one of the
two California men to win matches
against Stanford last year, put Tommy
Bowles away in a minute and thirty
five seconds of fighting. For a few
seconds it looked as if Bowles might
be able to give the little California
fighter a good battle, but Silverman
staggered Bowles with a shower of
blows and finally knocked him out
with a left to the body and a right to
the jaw. Silverman is one of the best
bantam weights seen here in some
time.
George Long, the highly touted light
weight from across the bay, who was
scheduled to meet Kenny Shipp, was
unable to compete because of sick
ness, and Coach Jones unexpectedly
substituted George Allen, a negro,
contrary to a previous agreement be
tween Stanford and California, when
the color line was drawn. Shipp made
short work of Allen, however. The
first round was slow, neither man
landing any blows that did any dam
age. In the second round Shipp open
ed up and landed a series of blows
that staggered Allen. Allen was
groggy as the round ended and the
bell alone saved him from a knock
out. The third round was a repeti
tion of the second. Allen being saved
from a knockout when the referee
stopped the bout and gave the decision
to Shipp. Shipp has developed a left
which is almost an dangerous as his
right, and he made both of them count
Saturday night. He fought the best
bout of his career and he may be
looked to for more good performances.
Bennie Einzig, who knocked out his
Davis Farm opponent in ten seconds
two weeks ago, a better man in
Jimmie Ross. Ross carried the fight
to his opponen at all times and could
not induce Einzig to the lead. Both
men 4vere wary in the first round, with
Einzig clinching repeatedly. This
round was close with Ross having a
shade on his opponent. The second
round was a draw, both landing many
blows. In the final round Ross better
ed Einzig to the ropes repeatedly and
the California star was forced to clinch
many times. His win over Einzig
stamps Ross as the best light weight
in college boxing on the Pacific Coast.
Bill Burkhard won from Walt Robin
son in the welter weight class in the
fastest bout of the evening. Both
men started early in the first round
and there was plenty of action at all
times. The first round was Burkhard's
after a fast exchange of blows. In
the second. Burkhard's left found its
mark repeatedly on Robinson's body
and head. Robinson countered with
lefts and rights to the head, but the
round went to Burkhard by a shade.
Burkhard led all the way in the third
and he was given the decision.
Jimmy Cline, the California star who
had previously been declared inelig
ible, failed to shine in his bout with
"Husky" Wassum. Last year, Murphy
was accused of slowing up his fight
with Cline by clinching. Cline seems
to have learned something from Mur
phy if this is the case, for he put
up one of the cleverest exhibitions of
stalling, Saturday night, that has ever
been seen here. He clinched and held
at every opportunity during the en
tire bout and was given an unpopular
decision. Wassum showed that Cline
could be hit and hit hard. The first
round was Wassum's by a shade, and
the second went to Cline, with the
third a draw. A draw decision would
have been fair to both men.
Bob Crowley won from Mark Evans
in the final bout of the evening.
Crowley failed to show much, but
Evans was not in shape to give him

enthusiasm of the fans was at a high pitch during the entire evening.
In the first exhibition bout of the evening, Abe Rubin, won the decision
over Jack Fishburn in the lightweight class. The match was a good one for
an opener as both men were willing mixers. The first round ended with
neither man getting the advantage. The second opened with a fast exchange
of blows at close range. Rubin's blows were particularly effective in the fre

Fishburn on the defensive, with Rubin landing the majority of blows.
Walt Bills, the heavy hitting Card welterweight won his exhibition match
from Bernie Garcia, in spite of the fact that Garcia entered the ring at the

sound of the first gong with murder
in his eye. Garcia "came in like a lion

time that he came down to earth, the

bantam weights seen here in some
time.
George Long, the highly touted light
weight from across the bay, who was
scheduled to meet Kenny Shipp, was
unable to compete because of sick
ness, and Coach Jones unexpectedly
substituted George Allen, a negro,
contrary to a previous agreement be
tween Stanford and California, when
the color line was drawn. Shipp made
short work of Allen, however. The
first round was slow, neither man
landing any blows that did any dam
age. In the second round Shipp open
ed up and landed a series of blows
that staggered Allen. Allen was
groggy as the round ended and the
bell alone saved him from a knock
out. The third round was a repeti
tion of the second. Allen being saved
from a knockout when the referee
stopped the bout and gave the decision
to Shipp. Shipp has developed a left
which is almost an dangerous as his
right, and he made both of them count
Saturday night. He fought the best
bout of his career and he may be
looked to for more good performances.
Bennie Einzig, who knocked out his
Davis Farm opponent in ten seconds
two weeks ago, a better man in
Jimmie Ross. Ross carried the fight
to his opponen at all times and could
not induce Einzig to the lead. Both
men 4vere wary in the first round, with
Einzig clinching repeatedly. This
round was close with Ross having a
shade on his opponent. The second
round was a draw, both landing many
blows. In the final round Ross better
ed Einzig to the ropes repeatedly and
the California star was forced to clinch
many times. His win over Einzig
stamps Ross as the best light weight
in college boxing on the Pacific Coast.
Bill Burkhard won from Walt Robin
son in the welter weight class in the
fastest bout of the evening. Both
men started early in the first round
and there was plenty of action at all
times. The first round was Burkhard's
after a fast exchange of blows. In
the second. Burkhard's left found its
mark repeatedly on Robinson's body
and head. Robinson countered with
lefts and rights to the head, but the
round went to Burkhard by a shade.
Burkhard led all the way in the third
and he was given the decision.
Jimmy Cline, the California star who
had previously been declared inelig
ible, failed to shine in his bout with
"Husky" Wassum. Last year, Murphy
was accused of slowing up his fight
with Cline by clinching. Cline seems
to have learned something from Mur
phy if this is the case, for he put
up one of the cleverest exhibitions of
stalling, Saturday night, that has ever
been seen here. He clinched and held
at every opportunity during the en
tire bout and was given an unpopular
decision. Wassum showed that Cline
could be hit and hit hard. The first
round was Wassum's by a shade, and
the second went to Cline, with the
third a draw. A draw decision would
have been fair to both men.
Bob Crowley won from Mark Evans
in the final bout of the evening.
Crowley failed to show much, but
Evans was not in shape to give him
a hard battle and Crowley stalled
throughout the bout, landing blows
occasionally, and finally winning the
decision.
Stanford forfeited to California in
he heavyweight class, because Jim
Arthur, Card heavy, injured his hand
in practice.
Willie Ritchie, former light-weight
champion of the world, refereed the
bouts, and Sol Levinson and Salazar
acted as judges. Roland Tisne, '21,
was the announcer.
Before the largest crowd that ever witnessed a boxing tournament on the
campus, the Cardinal boxers won two of three exhibition bouts and three of
six regular matches from the Blue and Gold pugilists in the pavilion Satur
day night. The bouts without exception were fast and hard fought and the
enthusiasm of the fans was at a high pitch during the entire evening.
In the first exhibition bout of the evening, Abe Rubin, won the decision
over Jack Fishburn in the lightweight class. The match was a good one for
an opener as both men were willing mixers. The first round ended with
neither man getting the advantage. The second opened with a fast exchange
of blows at close range. Rubin's blows were particularly effective in the fre
quent clinches, and the round was his by a shade. The third round found
Fishburn on the defensive, with Rubin landing the majority of blows.
Walt Bills, the heavy hitting Card welterweight won his exhibition match
from Bernie Garcia, in spite of the fact that Garcia entered the ring at the

sound of the first gong with murder
in his eye. Garcia "came in like a lion
and went out like a lamb." By the
time that he came down to earth, the
first round was half over, but enough
time remained for Bills to pile up a
good lead. In the second round Gar
cia still pursued his wild man tactics
with the same disastrous results to
himself. Bills' blows landed consist
entlye and repeatedly battered his
opponent to the ropes under a shower
of rights and lefts. Bills displayed
the same coolness and ring general
ship in the third round and no one was
surprised at the decision of the judges.
Jack Moran, the California welter
weight who was selected to meet
Johnnie Lane in the third exhibition
match certainly earned the title of
"One Punch Moran." He depended
during the entire bout on a left hook
to the-body delivered as he bore in on
Lane. Lane was equal to the occasion,
however, and met every rush with a
storm of lefts and rights. The first
round went to Lane. In the second
Lane landed blows at will and piled up
a still greater lead. Moran landed
effective blows for the first time in the
third round but Lane's lead was too
great and he won the decision.
Sol Silverman, who was one of the
two California men to win matches
against Stanford last year, put Tommy
Bowles away in a minute and thirty
five seconds of fighting. For a few
seconds it looked as if Bowles might
be able to give the little California
fighter a good battle, but Silverman
staggered Bowles with a shower of
blows and finally knocked him out
with a left to the body and a right to
the jaw. Silverman is one of the best
bantam weights seen here in some
time.
