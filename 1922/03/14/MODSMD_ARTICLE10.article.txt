## 
###

lectures to be given by members of the
faculty and others will be about meth
ods of research in literature and applied
arts, and methods of approaching prob
lems and how to handle evidence intel
ligently. Work done by members of
the club will be submitted to a commit
tee on investigation, and material ac
cepted is to be published in a series of
volumes known as "Publications of the
Renaissance Club of Stanford." and
similar to the Harvard Studies in Phi
lology.
This point of view has never been
tried out in America, but is an approach
to the Provat Docent system in Europe,
whereby a student with special contri
bution to thought is permitted to hold
classes as a reward for personal work.
There are to be no club officers, but an
executive committee will be clccted later
in the year, consisting of half grad
uates and half undergraduates. . Those
