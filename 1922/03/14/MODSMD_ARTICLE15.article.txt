# INTRAMURAL COURT SUPREMACY WILL BE DECIDED TONIGHT
## Alpha Delta Phi and Theta Chi Clash on Encina Court at 7:30 
### 
Intramural basketball supremacy for
1922 will be decided tonight when Alpha
Delta Phi's quintet gives battle to the
Theta Chi court live on the Encina floor
at f:30 o'clock.
Several weeks ago these same teams
came together in a contest featured by
fast playing and exciting moments. The
Theta Chi aggregation of lightweights
played better basketball than their
heavier opponents and won 11-8, having
retained the lead throughout the game.
Near the end, however, the Alpha Delta
Phi forwards took the offensive and al
most changed defeat into victory. A
switch in the Alpha Delt line-up
seemed to destroy the usual smoothness
of the court machine which has not left
the ranks of the winners during the sea
son. Tonight the old combination will
get a chance to try its luck.
The Alpha Delt five is fairly heavy
and well-proportioned. "Hank" Gerson
pivots the team from center. Gerson is
very fast and. unless closely guarded,
is liable to pile up the score with his
short tosses at tli*_- basket. Phil Neer,
forward, lias gained the reputation of
being the most consistent point-maker.
The scoring machinery of the quintet
is completed by Dennis, who dis
tinguishes himself by fast dribbling and
strong defense work.
The heaviest guarding falls on Cairns
and Pollard. Cairns, although light,
mixes into the scrap and covers his
territory efficiently. Pollard at stand
ing guard is the main reason for the
opposing forwards not getting short
shots at the hoop.
Theta Chi's advantage lies in speed
and accuracy in basket shooting. Both
these attributes arc supplied in goodly
measure by three former members of
the victorious Cardinal 130-pound squad,
Hogle, Hollingsworth, and Blosser.
Hogle and Hollingsworth form an elu
sive pair of forwards which is very
dangerous within a fair shot of the bas
ket standards. Blosser, the third mem
ber of the lightweight trio, plays at run
ning-guard, and shows a disconcerting
knowledge of where the ball is going.
Smith, center, is one of the strongest
men on both defense and offense. Bar
nard has done good work at standing
guard.
Between halves a short program of
gymnastic stunts has been arranged.
White, Hudson, and Sneddon, of the
Cardinal Gym teams, will give an exhi
bition of tumbling on the mats.
Had it not been for a first-round de
feat at the hands of Phi Kappa Sigma.
17-16, Theta Chi would have cinched
the campus laurels upon winning from
