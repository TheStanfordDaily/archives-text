# BASEBALL MEN TO MEET ST. MARY'S IN SECOND GAME
## Tomorrow Afternoon Madigan's Men Come for Tilt on Local Lot; Draper to Pitch 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon Coach Madigan
and his crew of St. Mary's baseballers
will make their second invasion of the
home camp of Coach Seay's varsity. On
their last trip to the Stanford diamond
they completely outplayed the Cards and
went away with the heavy end of a 9
to 5 score.
Guy Draper, who has been out of
uniform for the last two or three weeks
because of illness, will probably do the
chucking for Stanford, with Captain
Green taking the throws. Draper is
tlie veteran of the varsity heavers, and
his presence in the box tomorrow should
make it possible to send the Saints
home with an empty game bag. Captain
Green lias beeh on the injured list since
the start of the season, but was able to
work in two games last week, and, from
the way be walloped the pellet last Sat
urday, he can be counted on for a
couple of blows in each contest.
St. Mary's has a cracking good ball
club and has developed a hitting depart
ment which wins ball games. If Wales
and Cardoza show the same amount of
ability which they did in the first con
test, it will take all the dope in Draper's
old medicine bag to hold them to time.
1 )unn, center fielder, and Fleishman,
guarder of the tirst hassock, are two
more who are dangerous with the fungo.
Coach Seay will likely use the same
lineup which worked against the Santa
Clara nine last Saturday. Ratner or
Woodward will take the throws at first.
Patterson seems to be the logical man
for the initial hassock, but an afternoon
class has been keeping him out of the
first part, of the mid-week games. Rat
ner was doing the receiving during
Green's absence from the field, and will
now work at first or in the outer gar
dens. Woodward has proved to be an
all-around man and Coach Seay has
used him at first, shortstop, and in the
outfield.
Peavy is patroller of the keystone ter
ritory and he has been doing it in
thorough fashion. Maillot will take
short and "Lefty" Heckendorf third.
Both of these men are steady and sure
on the field, but they have not been
wielding the stick to good advantage.
They have been able to meet the sphere,
but a lack of clean hits has kept their
averages down.
Carver, Parker, and Wayland will
likely take care of the outlying regions,
with Woodward or Ratner filling in.
Carver is about the only man on the
squad who has hit to advantage so far
this season. The hitting department is
the glaring weakness in the Cardinal
nine. They have been able to find the
ball, but the hits have been scattered,
mostly fly balls, and not too numerous.
The game tomorrow will be called at
3 o'clock and student body cards will
admit. General admittance will be twen
ty-five cents.
