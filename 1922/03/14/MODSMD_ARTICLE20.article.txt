l'lie Men's Council has taken upon itself the pun
ishment of those who take books from the Library
without the permission of one of the Library force.
This practice has come to be serious not only in the
present time before final examinations, when all the
books are in great demand, but at any time in the
quarter. Books continually disappear from the ref
erence rooms and from the shelves of the large read
ing room on the second floor.
It is the privilege of all students to use these books,
and the abuse by a few wrongs the rest of the stu
dent body because not only are some put to real dis
tress by not being able to get a book when needed for
reference, but the rest are looked at with suspicion,
and the librarians have to keep a constant watch on
the doors to see that the books are not carried out by
people who do not sign up for them.
1 his use of the books is one part of the honor
system the same as honor in examinations. 11 the
use of books is abused, our honor system is just so
much weakened, and we lose that must prestige
thereby. Where one gains a benefit for the time,
several lose a chance perhaps to pass a course. Think
it over.
