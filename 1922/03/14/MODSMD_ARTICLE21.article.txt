# THE
						MODERN PROBLEM
## 
### 
A certain W. L. George has summarized it all over
again: Ihe real problem is not how to reform the
modern girt, but how to live with her, states this
savant, thus giving at least a practical turn to a long
lived discussion.
And the solving of this problem really ought not to
be so bad, notwithstanding the black and disastrous
results predicted for the human race by many who
now pass time in mourning the disappearance of the
simple and demure girl of mother's day. Even after
the worst is said of the blase, sophisticated, bobbed
hair flapper of today, the present younger set of
women must have something in common with the old
fashioned girl, for quite as many young men as ever
are being daily trapped into the bonds and perils of
matrimony.
Despite constant regrets of "safety valves," "Let
ter Boxes," et cetera, stating that the only true and
worth-while girl is the old-fashioned kind, we doubt
if there will be any noticeable immigration to the
town of Sebastapol, which has just come forward
with the claim of great numbers of this very type,
willing to scrub, darn socks, and what not for the
eligible man.
We sometimes wonder if this modem girl isn't
pretty much like the ideal young lady of generations
past, after all. Women have always been criticised.
When they wore long and bulky gowns and bustles
these were attacked. Today their skirts are short,
and they are for this condemned. Formerly, tight
fitting, body-restraining, physically absurd garments
were worn and severely censored. Today the girl
supports her own body as she walks down the street,
but she still runs the gauntlet of criticism.
To our frightfully modernistic mind it occurs that
just a little may be said in favor of the girl of today.
Not that the old-fashioned girl was not attractive.
She must have been. And we also have it that she
was considerable of a problem to those people who
were worrying over the antics of a younger genera
tion fifty years ago, though many of her class have
proved to be the very best type of grandmother we
know today.
The modem girl problem will no doubt be settled

along the lines suggested by W. L. George. But why
all this worry about the modern girl, and old-fash
ioned girl, anyway. Both were good, and bad—we
like both of them—and are not both, after all, just
normal ?
