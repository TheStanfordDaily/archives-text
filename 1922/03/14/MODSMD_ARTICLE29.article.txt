eral were eligible.
Bohler placed Bryan in the position
of defensive guard because of his un
usual checking ability. Hjelte of O. A.

difficulty in capturing the center posi
tion. Sielk of University of Washington

position. The offensive work of Fox
of Idaho and the defensive work and
accurate shooting of Talt of California
made them favorites for the forward
jobs.
Bohler has selected a team made up
mostly of large, powerful men, who are
very fast on the court and who possess
an excellent knowledge of the game. It
is also interesting to note that Hjelte
and Talt are only sophomores.
