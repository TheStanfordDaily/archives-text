# NEW LAWN TO BE PUT IN MEMORIAL COURT
## 
### 
Memorial Court is being dug up pre
liminary to planting a new lawn. The
present sod, which has been in the court
for sixteen years, has become so full of
weeds as to be impossible to care for,
and is being turned under.
Fan palms lining the upper end of
Palm Drive have been removed. These
were found to be unsightly, as the dead
leaves hung down about the trunk and
gave the impression that the tree itself
was half dead. By removing these palms,
which are planted alternately with the
date palms, vistas of the shrubbery at the
upper end of the arboretum are opened
up,and the bordering line of palms made
more attractive.
