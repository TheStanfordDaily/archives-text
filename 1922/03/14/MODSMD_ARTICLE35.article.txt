## 
### 
Nestoria's end-quarter banquet, at
which officers for the coming session
will be elected, is to be in the Union,
Thursday evening, at 6 o'clock. One
of three questions submitted by St.
Ignatius for the dual debate sched
uled next quarter, will be decided
upon at this time. The questions deal
with the state water and power act,
to come up as a referendum measure
next fall, the movement for amend
ment to the constitution by direct
vote, and the abolishment of capital
punishment in California, with the sub
stitution of life terms of hard labor
