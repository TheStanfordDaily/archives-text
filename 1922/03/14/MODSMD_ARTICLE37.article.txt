THE SOLDIERS' BONUS
The Soldiers' Bonus Bill, which is at
present before the House Ways ami
Means Committee, provides four alter
native typas of relief:
1. Issuance of certificates which the
ex-soldiers might use as collateral up to
one-half their face value in borrowing
from a bank;
2. Aid .in securing a farm or home;
3. Vocational training;
4. Settlement by a gift of land.
It seems almost certain that the bill
will pass both the House and Senate,
but the President is expected to veto it.
Secretary of the Treasury Mellon in a
letter to Chairman Fordney condemned
the bill on the ground that it will cost
as much as direct payment of a cash
bonus and provides no method for meet
ing the expenses.
"There is no way," he wrote, "by
which the American taxpayer can avoid
the burden, and if the bonus is to be
imposed it is far better for all con
cerned that it be placed upon a direct
and definite basis, and paid for each
year out of current revenue."
THE ARMY OF OCCUPATION
A billion gold marks lias been paid
to the alleged reparations commission
by Germany in accordance with the
Treaty of Versailles. The commission
has divided the entire sum between
England, France, Italy, and Belgium.
The United States lias put in a claim
for $241,000,000 for maintenance of the
American Army on the Rhine. Ac
cording to an agreement between the
Allies, the cost of the armies of occupa
tion should be paid first.
The Allies admit that the claim of
the United States is a just one, but also
maintain that the money was paid under
the Treaty of Versailles, which pre
cludes the United States from receiving
any portion of it, as she failed to ratify
the treaty. Our chances of getting pay
ment directly from Germany are slim,
and the only otlier way is to use the reg
ular Allied channels. If no settlement
can be realized the controversy may
bring the whole subject of European in
debtedness before the Debt-Funding
Committee of the United States recently
appointed by the President to deal with
the Allies' debt to the United States.
ARMY EXPENDITURE
The House Appropriation Committee
in preparing the House Appropriation
Bill for the next fiscal year cut down
the War Department's demand both for
men and money. The bill calls for 35.-
000 fewer men, 1,000 fewer officers, and
$66,798,900 less expenditure than . the
War Department estimates called for.
This would give us an army of 115,000
men, 11.000 officers, and an expenditure
of $224,722,808, which is $119,000,000 less
than the appropriation for the present
year.
The committee wants the withdrawal
of all troops which have been stationed
in China since 1900, and a reduction of
our forces in the Hawaiian Islands, and
in the Canal Zone, and on the Rhine.
The British army estimates for the
coming fiscal year are one-third less
and the naval estimates little more than
half the amount appropriated for the
current year for the respective depart
ments.
