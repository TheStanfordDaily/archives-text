# Baseballs Flying Thick and Campus Awaits Contests
## 
### 
Spring is here and with its coming,
baseball is once more in full swing
on the campus. Nearly every living
group, as well as the off campus
group, is organizing or has organized
within the last few days a baseball
team in preparation for the spring
drive. Practice is well under way on
the campus, and already a few games
have been played, originating from
challenges.
The regular schedule will not be in
operation until the early part of the
spring quarter, but a challenge series
is running now to give practice to the
groups which have teams already in
working order.
The executive branch of the intra
mural baseball organization in Encina,
in charge of Charles S. Botsford, is
active. T>vo hundred p."J 112c f ty dollars
hr.s been voted to take ctre of the
diamonds already a; the disposal of
these teams, and three more new
diamonds will be laid out and rolled
by the time the season opens. There
will be one near Sequoia Hali, one in
the field behind the library, and the
other to the north-east of Encina Hall.
Backstops will be put up for all of
them, and the old faculty club dia
mond will be restored to good shape.
Provision has further been made for
to supply masks, protectors and other
equipment for the teams.
In addition to the regular games of
the intramural schedule, there will be
games slated with outlaw teams from
Menlo Park, Palo Alto and Mayfield.
