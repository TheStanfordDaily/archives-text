# Five Men Selected For Golf Practice at Menlo
## 
### 
According to arrangements made by
the graduate manager's office, five men
have been given the privilege of prac
ticing for the golf team on the Menlo
Country Club course. They are Van
Keuren, Alabaster, Bischel, Miller
and Putnam. These men had no reg
ular course on which to play and were
selected as a result of competitive
scores.
The team to meet California the
first of next quarter will be selected
from these and also from those men
who are playing on their own courses.
Others wishing to try out may do so
by turning in certified scores to Cap
tain Rosenblatt.
