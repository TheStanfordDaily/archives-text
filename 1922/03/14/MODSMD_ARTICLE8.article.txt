Coast will be pitted against the Cardi
nal speed-burners In the six meets ar

The annual clash with California
on April 22, and probably the I. C. A.
A. A. A. national championships at
Harvard, May 27 and 28, are the main
objectives of Coach Templeton's
charges. Filial arrangements have
not yet been concluded for the big
eastern intercollegiate event, and
whether or not Stanford will be repre
sented at Cambridge is largely de
pendent on the success of the pre
liminary season.
As the Blue and Gold meet will
take place at Berkeley, the main at
tractions on the Cardinal cinder-path
will be the All-Southern Conference
team anil the University of Southern

Charles Paddock, champion sprinter
of the universe, has donned the spikes
once more and will captain the Trojan
aggregation. Assisting Paddock will
be "Swede" Evans, who tosses the
discus and puts the shot, and several
others of proven worth.
The All-Southern Conference team
represents the pick of Whittier, Red
lands, Pomona, and the California In
stitute of Technology. Charles Daggs,
who has been breaking the tape with
regularity in the hurdle events, and
versatile Bill Yount of Redlands, who
also specializes in the sticks, will
probably be seen in action here.
During the Easter vacation, Temple
ton will take a squad to Los Angeles
to battle the U. S. C. athletes, at
Bovard field. As the schedule now
stands, there will be a week and a
half of rest before the California meet
