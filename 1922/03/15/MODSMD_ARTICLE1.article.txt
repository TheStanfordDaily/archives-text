# WINGED "O" SQUAD MEETS TEMPLETONS TRACKMEN SATURDAY
## Club Men Lack Old-time Stars, Hartranft Breaks Record for Shot-Put in Practice 
### 
Minus Johnny Norton and several
other of the old-time point winners,
Frank Foster's Olympic Club track team
opens the season against the Cardinal
squad next Saturday afternoon on the
local oval.
By way of preparation for the tussle
with the clubmen, Glenn Hartranft, '24,
bettered the world's record for the 12-
pound shot-put by nearly five feet in
practice yesterday afternoon, thus con
tinuing on his record-breaking rampage.
Hartranft's heave landed on the other
side of the end embankment, and mea
sured about sixty feet, although accurate
figures were impossible on account of the
sloping ground.
The late Ralph Rose, former Olympic-
Club athlete, holds the world's record of
fifty-five feet, made several years ago.
Hartranft's mark is unofficial, being
made in practice, but trie young giant
from Fullerton should find little difficulty
in shattering Rose's record in regular
competition.
The veteran MacGurn of the Wing-O
will compete against Hartranft in both
the shot and the discus next Saturday,
but it is hardly likely that he will be able
to beai the Cardinal phenomenon. Ollie
Snediger, famous as an all-round athlete
twenty years ago, is as hale and hearty
as ever, and at the age of forty or so will
enter the lists against the youngsters in
several of the field events.
Krogness, late of Harvard, comes as
near filling Norton's place as any of the
newcomers. He high-jumps, and, be
tween tries, takes a turn at the hurdles.
Pyne will be on deck again, and he and
Krogness will give Lane Falk, Gene
Davis, and Orlo Hayes of the Cardinal
a race in both the stick events.
Where the varsity is strong, the Olym
pic aggregation is weak, and vice versa.
Charley Hunter, who traverses the two
mile event well under ten minutes, is
quite a ways above any of the Stanford
performers. Art Forward in the mile,
if he competes, is slated to break the
tape first.
Stanford seems to have a monopoly
on the points in both sprints, high jump,
pole vault, discus, shot-put, and javelin.
Newhoff will wear the Olympic colors
in the dashes, but he hardly measures up
to Sudden, Carrey, and Comstock.

Charley Hunter, who traverses the two
mile event well under ten minutes, is
quite a ways above any of the Stanford
performers. Art Forward in the mile,
if he competes, is slated to break the
tape first.
Stanford seems to have a monopoly
on the points in both sprints, high jump,
pole vault, discus, shot-put, and javelin.
Newhoff will wear the Olympic colors
in the dashes, but he hardly measures up
to Sudden, Carrey, and Comstock.
