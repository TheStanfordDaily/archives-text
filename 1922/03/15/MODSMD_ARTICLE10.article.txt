# INTRAMURAL BASKET HONORS CAPTURED BY ALPHA DELTA PHI
## Hard-fought Game Ends With 12-7 Score; Victors May Play California Champions 
### Robert Edwards, '24 
Alpha Delta Phi won the intramural
basketball championship for the sec
ond time in the past two years by
defeating the Theta Chi court five last
night, 12 to 7. It is planned to have
the local winners meet the intramural
champions of California.
Playing a superior brand of basket
ball. the Alpha Delta Phi aggregation
outclassed Theta Chi, and, with the
exception of a short period in the first
half, retained the lead during the en
tire contest. However, the winners
had to travel at top speed at all times
â– o hold on to their slighf&dvantage in
points. A momentary let-down in play
ing might easily have cost them a
victory.
After a few minutes of see-saw play
at the beginning of the game, Gerson
scored the first basket for the Alpha
Delts. From then on, the latter put
up a defense that was difficult to
pierce, and the Theta Chi forwards
were unable to get through for short
shots at the basket. The losers also
did some close guarding, but their
larger and heavier opponents had the
advantage in the mix-ups. Both
squads displayed high class teamwork.
However, the winners worked around
the floor better, and more accurate
passing allowed them to carry the
ball down the court for short shots
at the hoop.
"Hank" Gerson, playing center for
Alpha Delta Phi, captured the largest
share of stellar honors, by piloting his
team effciently and tossing four field
goals. The other score from the field
was made by Cairns, running guard.
Phil Neer, played a hard, consistent
game at forward, accounting for a
pair of free throws. Rennis, for
ward, proved to be one of the best
defensive players 011 the court, while
Pollard left little to be desired in his
standing guard department.
Schultzberg, who was substituted for
Hollingsworth in the speedy 130-pound
trio of which Hogle and Blosser were
the other two members, played an
excellent game and with Hogle form
ed perhaps the fastest pair 011 the
court. Winged Mercury couldn't have
much on Hogle when it comes to
flitting about after the elusive casaba.
Blosser and Barnard took care of
the guard positions very well. Blos
ser hounded the ball, continually,
while Barnard showed several flashes
111 addition to his work of taking the
shots off the backstop. In the first
half, Barnard dribbled the length of
the court and scored a field goal
which put Theta Chi in the lead, 3
to 2, but this lead had a brief exist
ence, for Neer converted a free throw,
and Gerson found the hoop a little
later on a fast play under the basket.
Smith, Theta Chi center, threw the
