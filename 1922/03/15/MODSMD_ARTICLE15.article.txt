Gold babes have one of the best nines
that has been put in the field for several
years and the Cardinal freshmen will
have to go at top speed if they arc to

to a 4 0 score last year. Sacramento
High School is reported to have a team
of fast ball players and if this is the
case, they will be welcomed as the fresh
men have not met any teams thus far
which have been capable of giving them
much competition.
