Stanford lightweight quintets have furnished some
of the prettiest basketball games of the two past
seasons. These men practice hard for their games
and show team work that would do credit to Varsity
or Freshman fives. The midgets follow a regular
schedule of games and are handled through the man
ager system as with any other of the intercollegiate
sports.
Up to now no recognition has been given these
teams except the applause and commendation they
have won-from crowds at their contests and from
individuals who have admired their playing. For
two years the "one-thirties" have beaten the Univer
sity of California limit quintet in regular series.
At Berkeley the lightweight branch of basketball is
a first-class minor sport and a circle "C" is the reward.
As a merited award and an added incentive to par
ticipation in lightweight athletics the teams which
play a major sport in the lightweight divison might
well be added to the ranks of those receiving first
class minor sport recognition, namely the block circle
"S".
