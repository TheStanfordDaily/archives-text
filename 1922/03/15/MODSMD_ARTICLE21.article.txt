# MISNAMED, PERHAPS

At Chicago there is a club called the "Five-Minute
Eggs". The members thereof are hard, very hard,
along the line of the famed crew of Columbus. They
cultivate a flint-like exterior and a demeanor of
hatred of all that is co-educationally feminine. The
tale does not say, but it is not too much to suppose,
that the hardest guys even chew "Masterpiece" and
chuck dimes at a wall on the structural science corner
if they have one.
But are these eggs so hard ? Perhaps they are the
same as the kind we see every day boiling around
here. They pride themselves in that mackinaw or
those logger hoots and do evoke more than a pass
ing glanceâ€”from the person not versed in our pro
vincialism. But maybe beneath the armored camou
flage these bad hombres of Chicago are the same
gentle souls that dwell iti our peaceful community.
