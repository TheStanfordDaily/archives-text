# SAFE AND SANE
## 
### 
With the coming of spring the annual crop of student
owned autos will soon be blossoming forth. The slow pedes
trian will once more have to give way to the speeding motor
ist. The campus highways between classes will again begin
to look like down-town Fifth avenue during rush hours.
Only the traffic policemen are lacking, to safeguard the un
wary pedestrian's life.
It is perfectly possible to drive an auto without disturbing
any one. Speed laws and laws against muffler cut-outs were
devised with this idea in view. The ten-mile-an-hour speed
limit is unreasonably low, but a moderate amount of consid
eration for the public is not too much to ask of the driver.
There were good grounds for the complaints last year that
students were often thoughless in handling cars on the cam
pus. [112 students want to drive cars, all well and good; but
let them have a decent regard for others' nerves.â€”Cornell
Sun.
