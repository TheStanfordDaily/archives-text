# GET TO WORK
## 
### 
Finals are rapidly approaching. The quarter has
slipped by so fast that it is harrl to realize that in two
more weeks we will once more be in the throes of quar
terly exams. Right now, today, is the best time in the
world to start preparing.
We have been letting term papers, laboratory reports, book
reports, and what not hang over for several weeks. In the
rush of student life, with its multiplicity of interests inside
the classroom and out, these extra duties have been allowed
to ro untouched. This is no great calamity, nor are we any
thing worse than human in so managing our affairs; it is a
natural thing not to do anything today which can be put off

till tomorrow. But if we don't get busy right away, we
shall find ourselves in hot water.
Make it a point to get that reading for long papers done
immediately. Get some action on the laboratory reports you
have been letting ride. Start working oti every one of the
half dozen or more disagreeable or tedious tasks you have
been putting off. By so doing we will make things a good
deal easier for the instructors and for ourselves, and be able
to get eight hours sleep the night before finals begin instead
of two or three or none at all.
If you want to feel fit when writing your exams, and be
able to enjoy the short vacation in a normal manner instead
of lying in bed till noon every day catching up on lost sleep,
get to work immediately.â€”Minnesota Daily.
