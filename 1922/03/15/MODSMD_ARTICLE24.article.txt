After boxing long into the short hours of the night, we
hereby explode with a staccato plunk and ask, what the
heck can a guy make out of notes like these?

Spring—A poem
(Yeh, it sometimes gets that bad).
Oh, the pie plant bakes In the boiling sun.
And the birds are coming on the run;
But the lambs still gamble on the green,
While the red is paying at one-fifteen.
• • *
"Why didn't you look where you're going?"
"I did, but I wasn't going that way."

Gosh, what a sarcastic guy. Says he "Her death bed
scene left nothing to be asked."
• * •
With a sweeping bow, we brush off our hat to the
athletic financiers. Stanford's new tennis courts (nope,
this isn't a dedication) are covered with small and
shockingly loose rocks, placed there with admirable
foresight and considerable depth, so that a guy has to
buy a new pair of shoes every week off the gum. Not
to mention, in public anyway, the ventilation afforded to
pants in accidental hook slides down the foul line. Yeh,
it's a regular money-making proposition, men slip iu
on the ground floor now.

Hugo, the midnight moth, hit the down-grade when
he remarked that It takes a guy with a lot of courage
to use a time schedule this early.

"Hey, phone for Skug!"
"Hold the wire, he isn't in."

"Here, what's this? How'd that thing to the south of
us get in? Oh, well, there it is, and there's probably no
help for it."

Ever see the janitor brush all the dopesheets into the
waste-basket? Well, that gives you a picture of Hanni
bal Hamm partaking of a light repast. Not that he ever
did, except once when he ordered a cup of tea. an olive,
a wafer, and a club steak.

Hannibal was a well-proportioned gent of about medi
um height and the same width. His expansive face
was a study in six courses, and his panoramic mouth
would spread in a smile at the drop of a hat. He had
a roll-top chin, twin screw brogans, and a vacuus intake.
In fact, this Hannibal was as completely furnished as
an overstuffed furniture store.
♦ * +
His favorite expression was "I don't mind if I do."
and his favorite dish was a dish-pan. Strangely, he did
not care for women, as he said they were not fitting
companions for a man of his dimensions. When he sat
down, Hannibal sat on his own lap. He had never
lavished his passion on any one, except once when he
got stuck on a door.
» * •
Such is Hannibal Hamm, the hasher, whom you can
find today anywhere on the floor of the city's favorite
restaurant, where he burst last week after eating twen
ty-seven yeast cakes.
* » *
Must be a hard job, keeping that lighthouse out in
the ocean.
Naw, nothing to it—the thing stays out there itself.
# * *
Here we have it, ladies and gentlemen—how to make
money during spring vacation. Graft all the bikes, then
wait for the five bucks reward and no questions asked.
* * *
Use your own judgment on this: "There is nothing
better than five minutes with a pair of dumbells, if a
girl wants to put roses in her cheeks."
,-i * * »
We note with stupefaction that they are taking out
every other palm where the drive turns. Kinda rough
on the eggs bent on wrecking the average.
♦ * •
It was bad enough for the pedstrians before, with
those horrid high-power lights. But really, my dear,
it's quite impossible now. And cactus is so deceptive
by moonlight.
* * *
"Seventy Stanford women have strictly observed
training rules for two weeks." My gosh, no wonder
they've been having those special sales—a five-pound
box, reduced to four —and all that.
* » *
Observed 'em ourselves, once. But that was as far as
it got.

Honestly, Robertina, I don't think it's quite fair. Just
when we've got our ears nicely covered, along come
those horrid boys and start the same thing. It's a mean
advantage to take. Besides, what do they want with
side-burns. They tickle frightfully, too.

Hannibal was a well-proportioned gent of about medi
um height and the same width. His expansive face
was a study in six courses, and his panoramic mouth
would spread in a smile at the drop of a hat. He had
a roll-top chin, twin screw brogans, and a vacuus intake.
In fact, this Hannibal was as completely furnished as
an overstuffed furniture store.

His favorite expression was "I don't mind if I do."
and his favorite dish was a dish-pan. Strangely, he did
not care for women, as he said they were not fitting
companions for a man of his dimensions. When he sat
down, Hannibal sat on his own lap. He had never
lavished his passion on any one, except once when he
got stuck on a door.

Honestly, Robertina, I don't think it's quite fair. Just
when we've got our ears nicely covered, along come
those horrid boys and start the same thing. It's a mean
advantage to take. Besides, what do they want with
side-burns. They tickle frightfully, too.

Spring—A poem

Oh, the pie plant bakes In the boiling sun.
And the birds are coming on the run;
But the lambs still gamble on the green,

foresight and considerable depth, so that a guy has to
buy a new pair of shoes every week off the gum. Not
to mention, in public anyway, the ventilation afforded to
pants in accidental hook slides down the foul line. Yeh,
it's a regular money-making proposition, men slip iu
