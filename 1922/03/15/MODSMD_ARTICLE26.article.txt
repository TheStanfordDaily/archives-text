# ONION GEORGE SHEDS VIEWS ON ENDOWMENT IN NEXT 'PICTORIAL'
## 
### 
Onion George is out again. He breaks
forth with a series of startling state
ments on "The Endowment Campaign"
in the next issue of the Pictorial, on sale
Friday. He and his originator, Tom
Kleckner, have a toe-to-toe chat on fi
nancial matters and tilings like that.
A fight is started in "A Notion That
Hunts Worse," in which Mrs. Frances T.
Russell of the English department, sends
a biting reply to an article in the January
Pictorial called "A Notion That Hunts,"
which said that scholarship requirements
might not be as stiff as they are pro
claimed to be. Mrs. Russell gives a dar
ing expose of the true undergraduate
attitude toward scholarship.
The Pictorial will present a scintillat
ing innovation in photography in the
coming number. Assuming the role of
judge of the merits of hopeful celebri
ties, Pictorial has nominated in photo
graphic form several neophytes for the
enteroom of the Hall of Fame. Spring
athletic activities, including rugby, soc
cer, baseball, track, and women's basket
ball, forms the center page spread. Cur
rent events are shown in an impression
istic light by Ted Van Deusen, '24, who
has contributed a page of cartoons,
which are accompanied by significant
statements in verse form. Finally, there
is a page of pictures showing Stanford
people in a thrilling search for knowl
edge and so forth.
Tom Irwin, '23, writing on "The Pea
nut Politician," says that politics aren't
so bad after all, though they can be kept
that way by the active interest of every
one. A summary of the new baseball
fight rules, and an argument attempting
to prove that the baseball fight has not
been emasculated has been contributed
by Carl Shoup, '24.
"Bob" Donaldson, '17, now in San
Francisco newspaper work, has con
tributed an article to the coming issue,
advancing the proposition of having a
general publicity man for the university,
to send items of interest all over the
country. This, he argues, will not only
bring the alumni into a closer relation
with Stanford, but establish a better
sympathy among the university's friends.
