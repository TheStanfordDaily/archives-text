# "Necessary Number" to Be Next Issue of "Chaparral"
## 
### 
The "Xecessary Number" will be the
first issue of Chaparral to come out next
quarter. Because the Utah Humbug has
already broken loose with an "Odd Num
ber," this title had to be changed for
Chaparral's coming edition.
Copy for the "Necessary Number"
must all be in the hands of the editor—
no fooling—by April 1.
