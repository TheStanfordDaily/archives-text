# Public Speaking Contest To be Held Next Quarter
## 
### 
A cash prize of $25 and a trip north as
the Stanford representative at the Inter
collegiate Public Speaking Contest to be
held on May 6, at the Washington State
College, awaits the winner of the local
contest which the Department of Public
Speaking will hold on the campus on
Wednesday, April 12.

'"In this contest," said James C.
Emerson of the Public Speaking Depart
ment, "we want to develop the extempo
raneous, practical, plain speaking style
that will be of real value to the Stanford
student. Like the Intercollegiate contest
that is to be held later in the north, this
local contest is not a competition in ora
tory but in public speaking, and that im
plies everything that is practical and
straight-forward."

In order that students may have the
vacation in which to prepare their
speeches, the elimination trials will not
be held until Friday of registration
week. At these eliminations the eight
best speakers will be chosen, and these
will participate in the prize contest that
is to take place on Wednesday, the next
week. Speeches, which should be six
minutes in length, may be upon any sub
ject in which the student is interested.
Entries should be handed to Mr. Emer
son (Room 200, English Buildinfi at
the latest by Friday, March 24. Women,
as well as the men, are invited to par
ticipate in this contest. Graduate stu
dents, however, are ineligible.
