# AID TO CHINA IS CONDITIONAL, SAYS BAKER IN LECTURE
## Delegation at Arms Conference Attempts to Regain Lost Sovereignty 
### 
"The most important lesson to China
which came out of the armament con
ference at Washington is that for good
performance China may look to the for
eign powers for relief from the incum
brances which have been put upon her,
but that for bad conduct China may ex
pect no help from her humiliations,"'said
J. Earl Baker in his talk last evening in
the Little Theater on the subject of the
work of the Chinese delegation at the
conference. _

"The Chinese delegation purposes to
gain hack for China as much as possible
of the sovereignty which has been lost
or impaired during the past few decades.
China has never had control of the for
eign residents. They are tried accord

courts. Treaties have provided that for
eign settlements shall be governed by
foreign law. As a result of this the
treaty ports have become havens of
refuge for smugglers and revolutionists.
One of the aims of the Chinese delega

extra-territoriality. We feel that the
Chinese themselves are a little lukewarm
in wanting to get rid of this foreign in
fluence at present. The better law and
order, the sanitary methods and the gen

object lesson for the statesmen of
China."
Baker discussed the subject of foreign
postoffices in China. Until now there
have always been several postal services
maintained by various nations in the
cities of China. This took away a con
siderable amount of revenue from the
government. It was decided at the con
ference that so long as the Chinese pos
tal service is ministered with the present
regularity, the foreign postoffices shall
be removed. This is the lirst withdrawal
of foreign prerogative in China on the
basis of the efficiency of the Chinese gov
ernment along the line of the withdrawal.
In Baker's opinion it is a very important
precedent for the future consideration of
China.
Another problem which was brought
up at the conference was that of the in
tangible privileges of spheres of influ
ence which have been assumed by vari
ous nations in the different provinces
of China. "Resolutions were passed,"
said Baker, "which are quite definite
upon this point. I see na reason why. in
the future, serious plans for construc
tion by a foreign company in any prov
ince need be hindered by the fact that a
company of some other nationality has
