# VARSITY BALL SQUAD TO PLAY KENEALY'S SEALS TOMORROW
## Clark or Kelly to Twirl For Stanford Against Semi-Pro Team From San Francisco 
### 
Ihree games are on the schedule for
Coach Seay's diamond men. This after
noon the St. Mary's varsity comes for its
second tilt with the Cards. Tomorrow
Kenealy's Seals, not the Coast League
Seals, but a fast semi-pro club from San
1* rancisco, will try for honors with the
varsity. Saturday afternoon the Winged-
O nine will be the opponents.
Either Jim Clark or Jim Kelly will
start on the mound for the varsity to
morrow afternoon against Kenealy's
Seals. Clark worked against Ireland's
Independents last week and pitched a
strong game, discounting the home run
of Joe Kelly which was responsible for
the three tallies made by Cliff's men.
Kelly pitched the first seven innings of
the first game against St. Mary's and
had a good deal of difficulty with the
hard-hitting Saints.
Guy Draper will take the slab position
this afternoon and Coach Madigan's hit
ters are likely to run into a snag.
"Drape" is a hard man to hit, having a
good change of pace together with an
assortment of twisters.
Oeschger is the mainstay of the Saint
pitching staff and, although Madigan
took him out after the first inning of the
last contest because the Cards were find
ing the pellet, it is probable that lie will
start in today's game. Van Houtte is
another Saint heaver who handles the
job in thorough fashion.
Coach Seay will use his regular line
up in all three games. Green will prob
ably do the receiving. Patterson, Rat
ner, or Woodward are to take care of
things around first base. Peavy or
Mitchell will cover the keystone. Mailolt
has been knocking them down and keep
ing things clear around the shortstop
area. Heckendorf will play the third
base position. In the outlield there are
Carver, Parker, Wayland, and possibly
Woodward or Rattier.
The games today and tomorrow will
be called at 3 o'clock and the game Sat
urday with the Olympic Club at 3:15.
Admission is 25 cents or student body
cards.
