had two strikeouts to his credit and
three hits against him. During his
six innings, Draper held the visitors
down to two hits and walked three
men. One of these walks, the first
man to face "Drape," was due to a
cold arm, as Seay's veteran heaver
came right out of the dressing room
and took his place in the box. Draper's
work against the Phoenix sluggers
showed that he can be counted on to
make California earn all runs scored.

ed a bang-up game. Lindbloom did
the throwing for the Saints and with
the help of good support was able to
keep things well in hand. He annex
ed two strikeouts and allowed six
hits.
Nothing happened in the first two
innings and it began to look like a
nip and tuck contest. Then came the
third and St. Mary's had the edge
after that. Lindbloom made first on
Heckendorf's error. Dunne hit to
right and Lindbloom went to third.
Clayton flew out to Carver in loft and
Lindbloom scored. Then Wales crack
ed out a two-bagger, scoring Dunne.
A single to center by Cordoza put
Wales across the rubber for the third
tally.
Clouthurst, batting for Clark in the
varsity's half of the third, clouted one
through the keystone area for a single
but there were two down and he died
on the base. In the fifth Green hit a
single to right but there were two
down again and Draper's fly to right
fell into the fielder's hands.
In the sixth the varsity started a
rally that looked as though it would
even the score, but one marker was
the sole addition. Mitchell hit to the
pitcher and there was one gone. Peavy
hit a clean one to center and Patter
son followed with a single to right.
Parker brought the faus to their
feet when he drove out another single,
scoring Peavy. Everything was going
fine. But liatner hit a ground ball to
the short stop, a double play followed,
and the Card hitting spree was over.
In the seventh Draper's error and
a single to right by Dunne gave the
Saints their fourth marker. Cordozo
hit a double to left in the eighth but
was caught at third by Draper. In
the ninth, with two men out. Ratner
hit a single to left but he never got
around.

Summary: R. H. E.
St. Mary's 4 5 1
Stanford 1 6 3
By driving out three hits and tally
ing as many runs in the third inning,
the St. Mary's ball club took its sec
ond victory from the Stanford varsity
on the local diamond yesterday after
noon. The final score was 4 to 1.
Jim Clark was on the slab for the
varsity during the first three innings,
and was replaced by Draper who fin
ished the game. Clark held them
down in good shape for two innings
but in the third enough damage was
done to win the game.
When he went to the shower, Clark
had two strikeouts to his credit and
three hits against him. During his
six innings, Draper held the visitors
down to two hits and walked three
men. One of these walks, the first
man to face "Drape," was due to a
cold arm, as Seay's veteran heaver
came right out of the dressing room
and took his place in the box. Draper's
work against the Phoenix sluggers
showed that he can be counted on to
make California earn all runs scored.
Green held down the receiving end
of the battery combination and play
ed a bang-up game. Lindbloom did
the throwing for the Saints and with
the help of good support was able to
keep things well in hand. He annex
ed two strikeouts and allowed six
hits.
Nothing happened in the first two
innings and it began to look like a
nip and tuck contest. Then came the
third and St. Mary's had the edge
after that. Lindbloom made first on
Heckendorf's error. Dunne hit to
right and Lindbloom went to third.
Clayton flew out to Carver in loft and
Lindbloom scored. Then Wales crack
ed out a two-bagger, scoring Dunne.
A single to center by Cordoza put
Wales across the rubber for the third
tally.
Clouthurst, batting for Clark in the
varsity's half of the third, clouted one
through the keystone area for a single
but there were two down and he died
on the base. In the fifth Green hit a
single to right but there were two
down again and Draper's fly to right
fell into the fielder's hands.
In the sixth the varsity started a
rally that looked as though it would
even the score, but one marker was
the sole addition. Mitchell hit to the
pitcher and there was one gone. Peavy
hit a clean one to center and Patter
son followed with a single to right.
Parker brought the faus to their
feet when he drove out another single,
scoring Peavy. Everything was going
fine. But liatner hit a ground ball to
the short stop, a double play followed,
and the Card hitting spree was over.
In the seventh Draper's error and
a single to right by Dunne gave the
Saints their fourth marker. Cordozo
hit a double to left in the eighth but
was caught at third by Draper. In
the ninth, with two men out. Ratner
hit a single to left but he never got
around.
