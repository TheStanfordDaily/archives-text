# TWENTY-SEVEN TRACK IN TO FORM SQUAD FOR SOUTHERN TRIP
## 
### 
Twenty-seven men, including repre
sentatives in each of the fifteen events,
will comprise the squad of Cardinal
tracksters who will leave for Los
Angeles, March 24, to perform against
the U. S. C. Trojans, on Bovard field
the following day. The Stanford speed
burners, after the clash with U. S. C.
will return to the campus, no other
meets in the south being schodulPd.
There will be a respite in '.lie Kirk
sey-Paddock feud, which has been
waged since the spring of 1921, with
the Trojan flyer always the winner.
The "world's fastest human," as he is
called, has announced his intention of
leaving for the Hawaiian Islands in a
few days, to be gone a month. Kirk
sey has been doing light training, and
he may accompany the squad to Los
Angeles during spring vacation.
Meanwhile, Templeton's track aspi
rants, numbering over forty, are work
ing hard in preparation for the first
d\lÂ«) moot with the niymoic Club, on
Saturday. Art Wilcox, veteran pole
vaulter, is back in the fold, and will
compete in the event Saturday.
Eddleman, probably the best of the
two-milers, is training once more, al
though he has hardly recovered from
the effects of an injured tendon.
Mint Howell, with a mark of 6 feet
4 3-8 inches to his credit last year, is
gradually approaching that height,
topping the bar at six feet consist
ently. The Cardinal is well fixed in
both the hurdle events, with Lane
Falk, who placed second in the 220
yard hurdles at the I. C. A. A. A. A.
last year, leading the coterie.
Glenn Hartranft continues to attract
the attention of most of the spectators
who drift around to the oval. He
tossed the discus somewhere in the
neighborhood of 146 feet yesterday
afternoon, although the throw was not
measured with a tape.
Captain Hanner, as good, if not bet
ter, as any javelin thrower in the
country, has his eye on the American
intercollegiate record. The spear is
traveling quite a distance, one of the
tries landing on the 186 foot mark
yesterday.
