# YEARLINGS TO MEET PREP TRACK MEN OF BERKELEY, OAKLAND
## 
### 
Freshman track performers will
meet a combined team of Berkeley and
Oakland high schools Saturday morn
ing at 10:30, in the first yearling con
test of the season. Twenty-four men
will come to the campus, twelve picked
from each of the prep squads, and a
full program of events is scheduled.
This meet will take the place of the
contest with a picked Los Angeles prep
school team, which was called off by
southern school authorities.
Berkeley and Oakland have been
two of the strongest teams in Alameda
county track competition. In the past
five years, Berkeley has won a large
number of meets of that region, while
Oakland high has won the Oakland
Athletic League event for two years
straight. Oakland has lost most of
its surest point-winners this year
through graduation, including Jack
Helm, an all-around man who was ac
customed to take twenty points for
the Oaks in every meet. "Mitch"
Walker in the 100 and 220, Bennetts
in the pole vault, and Coakley, who
placed in the O. A. L. for the mile,
are the strongest Oakland competi
tors.
Exactly the opposite of the varsity,
the freshmen are especially strong in
the distance events, with Daly, Smith,
and Charles in the mile; Holland and
Daly in the half, and Shermund in the
440. If Guy Dennis competes, he will
tnke a first in the pole vault, unless
the prep men have a newly discovered
phenomenon to enter against him.
