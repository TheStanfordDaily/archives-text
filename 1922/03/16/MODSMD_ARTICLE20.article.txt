# FRENZIED FINANCE
## 
### 
The matter of bad-check writing by the care-free
youth and damsel continues in spite of all that is
said against it. Merchants in Palo Alto and the
banks there act tolerantly on the matter, and only
a few of them even make a charge for the n.s.f.'s
they have to return. Up at Oregon the university
has taken a hand in the matter and is going to put
the issuer of bad checks in the same class with other
miscreants who are dealt with by the Student Coun
cil. In Pennsylvania a charge is made by the banks
for all checks drawn for small amounts, and numer
ous other charges are made for small accounts.
C hecks for less than one dollar will not be honored.
Here the only charge made by the banks is fifty
cents for dropping below fifty dollars. These small
accounts are carried at a loss because they fluctuate
so much from day to day that no loans can be made
upon them. What they really amount in many cases
is a more or less gratuitous service.
The student who does not keep his check stubs or
fails to maintain some other system of tabulating
his bank balance is going on a poor track of finance.
He does not mean to make permanent overdrafts on
the banks or to leave bad checks in the hands of mer
chants, but he writes checks just the same and forgets
that each one means a subtraction from the account
in the bank.
To run over an account on Saturday deliberately is
considered no sin because you can go down to the
bank on Monday and put in some money, or even on
Tuesday, and no one will say anything. But although
nothing is said, there is a lot of thinking. It is easy,
perhaps, to get a hurry check from home or a little
loan from one of the fellows now, but it is not nearly
so simple to talk loans out of banks and business men
when you need a hurry-up sum to cover a deficit in
life off the campus. Get away from that habit of
drawing on credit to carry you along, and it will not
bother you any to keep 011 paying money instead of
paper when you get away from a town which sends
no more than polite reminders of no-fund checks.
