# ABOUT EXAMINATIONS
## 
### 
Next week is that of examinations, and we may
well give a thought to our honor system which will
be in force at this period as well as in the two past
examination seasons. For six months now we have
had the complete honor system applying to all exami
nations and study preparations, and it has been in
most cases an unqualified success. This record is one
of which we can be proud. Our system has been
tried out in various other colleges and for one rea
son or another has not worked in some of the institu
tions. Here we have had no strong complaint as
yet and seem to be making a success.
The Men's Council is seeking the co-operation of
the faculty by a letter explaining to them the working
of the honor system. It is hoped this letter will
clarify any faculty misunderstanding that may have
heretofore existed.
In this period of examinations the voluntary system
of checking up on a cheater will be the only method
of maintaining justice. The honor system is just as
much as we make it. Our united co-operation in the
matter of enforcement can make or break it. With
out the help of each of us the Men's Council is pow
erless because it can not do anything if violations are
hidden. We owe our support to the University and
to our organization to see that no one is given an op
portunity to make dishonest use of the honor system.
