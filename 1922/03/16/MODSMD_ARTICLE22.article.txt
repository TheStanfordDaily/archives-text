Dear Head of Cabbage:—l'm not feeling any too funny
today, Tom, and maybe I can't fill your colyum, because
I'm a dying man. Tom Hood, they say, died spitting
out blood and puns but I'm not a Tom. I regret that
I shall not live to hear you preach my funeral sermon
but I trust my colleagues will fix up a few last rites and
lefts to my memory.

Next week come the high hurdles and then it's all
over. A few of us will step them for a sweet "16,"
some will get '23" and others get disqualified for knock
ing too many over.

Meanwhile I'll make my farewell by singing:
RHAPSODY
Why is the poet so gay in the spring?
Why does the crazy man sing
Of the birds and the bees, and the flowers and trees,
Why does he do such a thing?
Oh I think that I know (ain't I doing it now?)
I've been finding out "why" if not "how,"
For the birds and the bees, and the flowers and trees
Will hardly a frenzy endow.
It's the ribbons pink, blue, and sashes so gay
And the white sport skirts in array,
For there's hardly a doubt it's the blossoming out
Of the co-eds that "get him that way."
P.ave on, you old poet, until you are shot,
For Nature enthuses you lot,
But the <?ay and new duds on these butterfly buds
Arp fh? reason, the h— if they're not.

And In oiir 'ast few, fitful gleams, just to prove the
true extent of our genius, we will have a "Feminine
Fling'' and produce feminine as well as masculine
humor. The las' "Chappie" showed us how distinctly
different they are.

A live, ambitious sailor lad.
TheccarP r i's job I eyed;
As third iPai I was not so bad,
And then the aptain died.
I'd be the widow's Husband Two
And get the captaii.'s place,
And sternly rulo the hip and crew
With autocratic face
i
And strange, I quick :.v won tier hand —
"I'm captain front f hi* da 1 12. —
"Indeed," she said, "j'lease unde tand
You're only second mate "

St. Patrick drove the snakes out o* li ; Vnistead

My epitaph: "And the elements so mixed u, in him
his nature might stand up and say to l 1! the world, 'A
Cabbage Man'."
