						GOOD VACATION
## 
### 
This spring-time vacation ought to be th« -st one
of the year because now the country wear its most
beautiful aspect, and everything is set for a w> 'der
ful time. We have been beset by the worst v . ther
that has fallen this part of the country in t
years, and the Christmas vacation was one s-»li< in
for the two weeks in most parts of the state.
Now is our chance. By taking advantage ! tin
fine weather we can do everything in the line o 1 v
ing a good time that we have promised ourselvt >r
the last three months. If we do all this we wiU
satisfied to come back to Stanford at the opening
the spring quarter and settle down to get much gr
out of the courses offered then. If we don't pi
hard for the vacation we will think all next quart*
that we have missed something, and we won't be abli
to put in the best work possible on study. That,
after all, is what we come here for, so let's get going
for a good old time these two weeks.
