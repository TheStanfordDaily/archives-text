# REGISTRATION FOR WOMEN
## 
### 
Women who are returning in the Spring Quarter
must either register before 5 o'clock on registration
day or notify the Registrar's Office in regard to lati
enrollment before that time if they do not wish
to forfeit their places in the list of women students.
The five hundred limit on the number of women
makes it necessary for the University to determine
the number entering each quarter by the number who
will not be back in college. When the limit is not
reached at the end of registration day the first womet?
on the waiting list are notified that they may enroll
in the vacancies left by former students.
Late registration is often necessary or entirely un
avoidable, but a few minutes time spent in sending
word of the delay to the office of the Registrar will
not only simplify matters for the force there, but will
also assure each woman of her place in the University
when she returns.
