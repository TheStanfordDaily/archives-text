# ROOMS IN NEW UNION TO BE READY BY APRIL
## 
### 
There are 112 rooms in the New
Union which will be ready for use
before the opening of the spring quar
ter. Only seniors, graduates or hold
overs are eligible for these rooms but
already there is a waiting list of about
100 men who have signed up for next
quarter. It has not been the impres
sion that graduates and holdovers
were expected to move into the New
Union as soon as it is available, but
the administration does not intend to
use compulsion in any way; all action
for securing a room is to be entirely
voluntary on the part of the student.
