LEGE, CORVALLIS, Ore., Mar. 17.—
(P. I. N. S.)—What made the whistle
blow? This was the question when
sophomores turned out to quel la rook
rally recently. An enterprising rook had
used an unusual device to turn on the
O. A. C. whistle. An alram clock was
set to relase the spring upon a mouse
trap, which in turn tripped a platform
containing two bricks. When the sopho
omores arrived on the scene the two
bricks were dangling on the whistle cord.
