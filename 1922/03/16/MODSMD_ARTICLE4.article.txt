# Campus Soon to Lose Only Titled Nobleman With Passing of Tagawa
## 
### 
Campus culinary critics will soon suf
fer a severe setback; jingling jokesters
of local journalism will lose one of their
never-failing sources of rhyme and pun;
aye, even so —for Tagawa passes.
No more, after the winter quarter,
will struggling Stanford students be able
to attribute late reports, cut classes,
missed examinations, to delay in getting
in (or out) of Tagawa's food emporium.
The Inn is to be moved from its pres
ent location, and the Union will be con
verted into an all-night lunchroom,
where students who have been studying
till three or four a. m. can drop in for
coffee and doughnuts.
