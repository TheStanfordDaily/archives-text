# MEN'S COUNCIL SUGGESTS RULES FOR HONOR SYSTEM
## Speakers Will Explain Agreement To Lower Division Classes 
### 
Co-operation of all students in regard to the honor system, and its application
in examinations next week, is urged by the Men's Council in a statement issued
today. In order to clear up any questions which may have arisen, and aid stu
dents in carrying out the spirit of this system, which has been adopted by the
student body as a Stanford tradition, several points in the pledge made to the
University last spring have been explained in detail.
Speakers appointed by the Men's Council give one-minute talks preceding ex
aminations in large Lower Division classes, composed of new students, explain
ing the substance of the agreement adopted.
This system obligates every student to refrain not only from receiving aid,
but also from giving any aid in examinations, papers, and class work in general,
unless otherwise instructed. Its enforcement depends upon the students' sense
of responsibility in reporting infractions to the Men's Council. For various rea-

sons many cases have gone unreported
and it has been suggested that instead
of individuals taking the responsibility
of reporting violations of the pledge,
this Tie done by group decision, thus
eliminating the personal element.
The Men's Council has made the fol
lowing suggestions by which the opera
tion of the system may be aided: first,
to have alternate seating wherever pos
sible; second, to have the instructor re
main in the examination room long
enough to answer questions of ambig
uity ; third, for the instructor to remain
in his office or a room near by during
the period of examination, to clear up
further questions of individual doubt;
finally, to have the instructor feel free
to go into the room at any time during
the course of the examination to make
explanations on obscure points.
A letter has been sent to members of
the faculty, asking their further co-op
eration and support in carrying out the
honor system during the coming exam
ination period.
