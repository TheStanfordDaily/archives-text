# WRESTLERS SELECTED FOR TROJAN TOURNEY
## 
### 
With all of the men in prime con
dition, the Stanford grappiors consist
ing of Sturm, Hosepian, Mercer, Jonu
son and McKee will leave for South
ern California on March 29, for the
meet with l>. S. C., the following day.
The bouts will probably take place
at the U. S. C. gymnasium.
Coach Harry Maloney has made a
slight change in the personnel of the
team since the elimination matches
on March 11. Dick Johnson, who was
one of the consistent wrestlers on last
year's team, but who had been out
all season because of an injured ankle,
will replace Boyle, in the 158-pound
division. Johnson staged a come-back
last week when he threw Boyle, the
w'nner in the elimination bouts, in
three minutes.
At the last meeting of the Pacific
Coast Conference, it was decided to
retain the old wrestling rules, but to
eliminate the feather and heavy-weight
classes. This ruling weakens the
Cardinal team somewhat, for it had
a clever featherweight in Bob Flem
ing, who normally is classes in the 125
pound division, but who easily could
work down to the featherweight class.
As there are no heavyweight wrest
lers out, the loss of this weight does
not affect the team.
Franz Storm, the chunky bantam
who is built on the plan of a miniature
Hercules, is perfecting his head
chancery hold to such a point that if
he once gets iont # on his opponent, the
latter is as good as done for.
The lightweight, Vaughn Hosepian,
is practically assured of a victory
whenever he steps into the ring, for
he is a natural born wrestler and bids
fair to become the Pacific Coast Ama
teur champion of his class. Hosepian
depends mainly on the body scissors
and the half-Nelson to weaken his
opponent.
Andy Mercer, the welterweight
grappler, is another man who has
shown marked improvement this year.
If he can use his feet to more ad
vantage, he will be a dangerous man
for the U. S. C. wrestler who opposes
him. Mercer relies on a peculiar type
of the bodyscissors, in which he sits
on his opponent's shoulders while ap
plying the hold, to force his man to
quit.
The light heavyweight entry, Nor
man McKee, is a clever and experi
enced wrestler, having been on the
Annapolis team for three years. Little
is known about the strength of the
U. S. C. team, other from the fact
that the students there have taken
renewed interest in the sport and that
the coach has had plenty of material
from which to build a strong team.
Coach Maloney is at present negoti
ating with the Pacific Fleet now sta
tioned at San Pedro, for a bout with
the sailors. The Fleet is somewhat
separated, but if they can collect a
team, a tournament is practically as
sured. This meet would follow the
one with U. S. C.
