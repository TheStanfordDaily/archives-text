# FIRST CALL FOR FOOTBALLAPR.3
## "POP" WARNER WILL BE ON HAND REGISTRATION DAY TO START PRACTICE CAPTAIN DE GROOT ISSUES CALL TO BE ON HAND 
### "Bill"—Blackface 
"Pop' Warner will be on the camptis
at the opening of next quarter, and foot
ball practice will start in earnest the
first afternoon. Captain Dud DeGroot
has received word from Warner that he
will be here with Kerr and Thornhill to
start the ball rolling at once and will
keep up the practice for from four to
six weeks if the weather does not get
too warm. It is DeGroot's wish to have
everybody out in a suit Monday after
noon, April 3, so that Warner can see
what kind of a turnout he is going to
have.
Suits, shoes, and other equipment can
be drawn at the supply room in the gym
nasium the last of vacation and on regis
tration day.
Warner will not be able to be here in
the fall, according to the plans at pres
ent, so that he will have to get in all his
personal work in the next two months.
This will necessitate hard work for all
of the men who want to stay on the
squad and will mean full afternoons until
the end of the spring season.
Thornhill, who coached the famous
Centre line of last year, will take tin
front liners here from the start and will
work them into the system that won his
team fame in the East and Wvst last
year. He has a good bunch to pick from,
as most of the big boys of the lineup
are back for next year and then there is
the recruit battalion from the '25 aggre
gation. "Dud" will captain his gang

from the center of the line, and on either
side of him he will have a few of the
featherweights and Lilliputians such as
I*a vi 11 e, Ludeke, Campbell, Shipkey, and
some more who have entered since the
last season and have a football pedigree
that says they ought to give the old
timers a tough run for the jobs.
Cuddeback looks like the boy for the
good old full position among the backs.
"Brick" Morse allows as how Cuddy is
one of the best little pigskin advancers
that Stanford has had in some time, and
after all "Brick" has been watching
Stanford teams play for quite a while.
Bud Woodward will be out after the
quarter job again, and he will have for
competition one Dick Lawson, the same
having directed the U. S. C. Freshmen
two years ago when they slaughtered the
Stanford babe eleven by a measly thirty
five tallies or so. Dick has the stuff and
so has Bud, so there's going to be a
wrassle to see who wins the command
ing berth. Ray Doughty Art Wilcox,
et al„ of the last year's eleven will be
on hand to furnish obstacles over which
the white hopes of the '25s will have to
clamber. Dennis, captain of the last
year's team .will be out for half or quar
ter, and Howard and Wheat will be
making tries for the backfield. The
coaches are going to have their hands
full, at any rate, and much good time
will be had and weight lost rapidly by
all hands.
