# CAMPUS PUFFERS HAVE PREFERENCE FOR TUBES OF WEED
## 
### 
"Ye goode olde pype of Fresluuane
rcnowne" seems to be unpopular with
the rest of the Stanford Family. Ac
cording to reports received from the
campus cigar stores, the snakish cigaret
leads in sale. Lucky Strike, Chesterfield,
and Camels are preferred in order. The
plutocratic potentate who ostentatiously
struts down the quad, with extreme pom
posity, a Havana tilted toward his patri
cian nose, makes the cigar rank second
by his purchases. And last of all. the
plebeian pipe and plug tobacco conies
tottering in, a feeble third, and none so
poor to do it reverenceâ€”but surely, tin
freshman with his odoriferous corncob
can be called somebody. Reports indi
cate that if the rest of the nation were
like Stanford, the Bull of Durham fame
would die of starvation.
