# WINGED "0" SEEKS TRACK VICTORY
## But "Dink" Templeton Just Smiles and Smiles and Smiles and Smiles 
### 
I hat the Olympic Club will conic to
the Farm tomorrow afternoon only to
return defeated, is the opinion of Coach
"Dink" 1 empleton, who is optimistic to
a high degree over the Cardinal outlook.
Except for the distance races, the Olym
pic men arc decidedly shaded, but the
dark horses which the club promises
to disclose may at least partially turn
the scale.
Kirksey, to whom all Stanford sup
porters look for a real display of talent,
ran tiie 220 in 23 3-5 in his first time
trial of the year. His legs are in good
shape for the first time in two seasons,
and lie should he able to surpass all
previous marks. Sudden's 10 Hat on the
muddy track last Saturday was the best
race he has ever run, and is something
for the Olympic sprinters to feel con
cerned about. Hartranft is running
10 1-5 seconds consistently, and the
chances are that he will hit ten flat on
a hot day. In fact, hot weather is what
the sprinters need. Both Carrey and
Cotnstock are running well and are apt
to place at the finish. Newhoff is the
best man on the O. C. team, and he will
be lucky to take better than a third in
this class.
1 he high hurdles should bring out a
pretty race between Krogness, the
former Harvard star, who took nine
points' in last year's I. C. A. A. A. A.,
and Falk, Hayes, and Davis. Krogness,
although not in training, should have
little trouble in winning over his more
inexperienced rivas. Falk should win
the lows, however, with Hayes and
Davis shutting the cubmen out of the
point column.
The Varsity should clean up in the
quarter, with Williamson, Clarke, and
Scoficld fighting it out for paces. Mac
a permanent home of their own. Here
records of all the honor societies of the
campus will be kept.
The present Union cafe, in the hands
of Frank Tagawa, will close with the
opening of the new dining hall. The
contemplated remodeling into a rath
skellar will not take place until the
Board of Governors has made a satis
factory survey of the need for it, and
of the response which the students man
ifest in their patronage of the new din
ing room.
Rooms in the new building are prac
tically all occupied. The original plans
called for one man as the occupant of
each room, hut already it has become
necessary to assign two to a compart
ment.

Cotnstock are running well and are apt
to place at the finish. Newhoff is the
best man on the O. C. team, and he will
be lucky to take better than a third in
this class.
1 he high hurdles should bring out a
pretty race between Krogness, the
former Harvard star, who took nine
points' in last year's I. C. A. A. A. A.,
and Falk, Hayes, and Davis. Krogness,
although not in training, should have
little trouble in winning over his more
inexperienced rivas. Falk should win
the lows, however, with Hayes and
Davis shutting the cubmen out of the
point column.
The Varsity should clean up in the
quarter, with Williamson, Clarke, and
Scoficld fighting it out for paces. Mac
a permanent home of their own. Here
records of all the honor societies of the
campus will be kept.
The present Union cafe, in the hands
of Frank Tagawa, will close with the
opening of the new dining hall. The
contemplated remodeling into a rath
skellar will not take place until the
Board of Governors has made a satis
factory survey of the need for it, and
of the response which the students man
ifest in their patronage of the new din
ing room.
Rooms in the new building are prac
tically all occupied. The original plans
called for one man as the occupant of
each room, hut already it has become
necessary to assign two to a compart
ment.
I hat the Olympic Club will conic to
the Farm tomorrow afternoon only to
return defeated, is the opinion of Coach
"Dink" 1 empleton, who is optimistic to
a high degree over the Cardinal outlook.
Except for the distance races, the Olym
pic men arc decidedly shaded, but the
dark horses which the club promises
to disclose may at least partially turn
the scale.
Kirksey, to whom all Stanford sup
porters look for a real display of talent,
ran tiie 220 in 23 3-5 in his first time
trial of the year. His legs are in good
shape for the first time in two seasons,
and lie should he able to surpass all
previous marks. Sudden's 10 Hat on the
muddy track last Saturday was the best
race he has ever run, and is something
for the Olympic sprinters to feel con
cerned about. Hartranft is running
10 1-5 seconds consistently, and the
chances are that he will hit ten flat on
a hot day. In fact, hot weather is what
the sprinters need. Both Carrey and
Cotnstock are running well and are apt
to place at the finish. Newhoff is the
best man on the O. C. team, and he will
be lucky to take better than a third in
this class.
