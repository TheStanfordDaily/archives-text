"He real Stanford Men and Women."
'I his Stanford ideal which in every counsel assails
the newcomer to the University is often at first intan
gible. Time and association alone bring a realization
of what it means to he a true Stanford man or a loyal
Stanford woman. Each student must come to
appreciate that blending of democracy, of freedom
of comradeship dominating the Stanford family
through close contact with it.
The freshman must particularly seek to grasp the
Stanford ideal. Before he or she can hope to be
come acquainted with the larger and finer things
that Stanford has to oiTer, the spirit which dominates
the institution must be masered.
Some of the members of the class of 1925 are
finishing their first quarter here. Others are con
cluding their second quarter, and one half of the
members of the class will within a few days have
spent three terms in the Stanford environment.
It is with pride that at this time the 1925 class
can say that in spirit and in achievement it is fast
becoming an integral and active participant 11 the
affairs of the big Stanford family. Members of the
class are to be found taking an active part in every
branch of University activity, whether it be academic,
athletic, or dramatic, forensic or journalistic. In
matters of observance of Stanford custom and tradi
tion it believes that it is not altogether amiss. The
democracy of the class, as evidenced at the recent
Freshman jolly-up, speaks well for the larger spirit
of Stanford democracy in which all are friends, with
which 1925 has been inoculated.
