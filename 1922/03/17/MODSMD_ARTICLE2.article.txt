# BABE NINE READY FOR SPRING TOUR
## Will Play San Diego High And Other Southern Prep Schools 
### 
A prolonged southern excursion will
be the lot of the perspiring members of
the 1925 baseballers during the spring
vacation, when the liabcs will seek dia
mond competition in more genial cli
mates. Leaving Stanford at 8 p. in.
Friday, March 24, the team will arrive
at San Diego on Saturday at 2:10, with
San Diego High School game scheduled
at 3 sharp. Solomon, as the huskiest
member of the mound staff, will do the
Hinging and will have a real job before
him to overcome the effects of the trip,
and the eccentric lighting of San Diego's
concrete stadium. After a lay-off on
Sunday, the second game will be played
on Monday afternoon. San Diego, ac
cording to Jess Puryear of the San
Diego Union, will have as strong a team
as that of last year, which carried off
the preparatory school championship of
the United States by defeating the Cleve
land, Ohio, High School, the acknowl
edged Eastern contender.
On March 28, 29, and 30 games will
take place in Los Angeles, Lincoln High
School being the only club definitely
signed up. The other dates will be filled
from a field of Los Angeles, Polytechnic,
Jefferson, Manual Arts, and Hollywood
High Schools. Jefferson is reputed to
possess the classiest aggregation of the
lot, but difficulties in the field of finance
have been delaying the arrangements.
Although very little dope has come out
in regard to the strength of the Los
Angeles entries, they seem slightly in
ferior as a whole to the Jefferson-San
Diego proposition, and the outlook is
promising for the freshmen.
The yearlings will then make their ap
pearance in Taft, where that high school
will entertain them on Friday, March
31,. No rumors of unbeatable teams
have floated in from the oil fields and
Coach Kallam is inclined to optimism in
regard to this game. The last stop of
the circuit will be at Ilanford, in which
city unusually good teams are sometimes
found. Sunday will see the men back
on the campus.
