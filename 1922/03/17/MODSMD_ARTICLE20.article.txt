# THE 						"FROSH" EDITION
## 
### 
Journalism has offered an attractive field of activ
ity to many freshmen students. Sixteen members of
the staff of the Daily Palo Alto are of the 1925
class. The majority of these have been but recently
selected to serve; but one and all have united in an
effort to make the Freshman edition of the Daily
I'ai.o Alto distinctive and worthwhile, it is hoped
that whatever the shortcomings of the paper may be
the charitable and forgiving sense of our readers
may attribute tljpin to the fact that today is St. Pat
rick's Day, and that the appropriate color is "green."
