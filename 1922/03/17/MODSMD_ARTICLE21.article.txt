### 
The Daily lakes this opportunity to say a word of
thanks for the makeup man who is graduating this
quarter and will not he on the paper any more. Sin
clair Trimble, '22, has been almost invaluable during
the past three years, and his absence will be keenly
missed by those who have appreciated the conscien
tiousness and originality that he has tfSed in his work
in the composing room on the paper.
