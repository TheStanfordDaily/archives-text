We take pleasure in introducing these bits of green
into the Orange State.

At any rate we have a verdant grave in which to
lay away the dead ones.

The Tall Timber having been supplanted, Mulligan
meekly inquires whence this name "The Daily Tree?"
Perhaps it's because the green leaves; but at any rate
it's over our heads.
* * •
Now that the optimists are selecting courses for next
quarter we ask you this, "Why do the Irish take to
pottery."
Answer: It's a clay "pipe."
* *
But I ask you, how can a guy cure a cofd with this
here one-half of one per cent sham rock and rye?
* * *
"What's the matter with that person?" asked the lady
tourist?
"He knocked out a tooth on the Blarney Stone, and
he feels a bit Ire-ish about it."

Paging St. Patrick
Oh, Patrick raise your sacred bones,
Ye gods, we need you now;
For Stanford is possessed with snakes.
Good Saint will you allow
This saddest state? These many nakes
Of high and low degree:
There're Beta snakes, and Alpha snakes,
And snakes with Kappa Key.
Some snakes have ties just like a string,
Somfe bandoline their hair,
The water snakes queen by the lake,
And they are passing fair, —
Boas coil 'round Roble girls,
We often glimpse them there.
Oh, Patrick, there are lizards, too,
Of a nocturnal type;
They sit around the sisters' halls;
There's nothing that they like
Better than to take a walk
Down by the Arboretum,
They feed the girls on Stickey's fruit
Wherever they may speed them.
And there are still some phantom snakes,
The "Rough and Ready" sees,
*• When he gets from Mayfield back,
With a case of real "D.-T.'s",
Oh, Patrick, raise your sacred bones,
And purge our sacred sod.
Our snakes and reptiles sure would give
The Saint a man-sized job.
¥ * *
St. Pat. Please!
"Why did Bill sell his Ford?"
"His girl kept on calling him a rattle-snake."

"Did you hear about Ireland's Independents?"
"No!"
"They fiinally got it."

"They're hanging men and women for the wearing of
the green," the poet wrote. That's not saying enough
to fill a hollow tooth, listeu to Ihis:

The Freshman's Consolation
Out of the muck which covers me,
Searsville and mud from toe to ear,
I thank what ever gods may be,
I'll be a Sophomore next year!
'Neath the swat of paddle stout,
I have not winced nor cried aloud;
And though they've battered me about,
I have not hollered with the crowd.
I do not care how hard they swat,
How much they fill my heart with fear;
This thought remains, how e'er they plot,
I'll be a Sophomore next year.

"What's that guy carrying around those property
stones for?"
"He's an impoverished Irish scene-shifter, who has
to have his shamrocks."
* * *
Help! Hitherto modest and retiring room-mate upon
being asked if he ever took part in an Irish Marathon,
replies, "Yeh," that he was a hod-carrier once for a day
and a half.

I met a poor young freshman
And took him by the hand
And I said, "How're things at Stanford,
And how do you all stand?"
"The most distressing company
That ever yet I've seen;
For they're tubbing every freshman
Who even tries to queen;
St. Patrick's day now we keep,
His color to be seen;
For there's no Cardinal law forbids
The showing of the green.
When law can tell the freshman
The thought's that he shall think;
And when it can prescribe the things
That go 011 'Jieath his dink;
Then shall they the color change
In which they now are seen
But till than time, please God, I'll stick
To the wearing of the green.
THE SEXTON TOLLED* HIS BELFAST WHERE
UPON HE LOST HIS CORK.
