# ARTISTS WOULD MOULD HUMANITY AS WELL AS SCULPTOR'S PLASTIC

The days of the French Revolution
are being recalled, and Stanford is the
possessor, 'unknowingly, of a Jacobin
Club. Despite the fact that it has but
two members, and an apprentice on pro
bation, it does not lack for discussion,
rts members have the proud purpose of
reforming the world. Mr. Seymour,
poet, writer of operas, artist, shingle
layer, and authority 011 tropical cooking,
is one half of the club. The other half
is composed of Mr. Paine, a well known
sculptor, and an amateur poet and
writer. Alden Pocter, son of the sculp
tor whose statue of the "Circuit Rider"
is now being enlarged by the Jacobin
Club from eight to five o'clock, is on
probation. He has yet to be sufficiently
ducatcd to become a member, and un
known to himself, is under considera
tion.
The headquarters of the new organi
zation is to be found in the east end of
the Aeronautic laboratory, west of the
Union, where a small door opens into
the larger world of their discussion.
Stanford students seeking the unusual
will find it there.
