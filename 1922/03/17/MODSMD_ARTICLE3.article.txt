### 
Arrangements may be made for the
Stanford fencing team to meet the
University of Southern California
team sometime during this spring va
cation. Coach Maloney is |in cor
respondence with the Los Angeles
Athletic Club in a effort of reach an
agreement. The Cardinal team has
some very good men and interest in
such a match should be keen. Harry
Sandretto is the intercollegiate novice
champion, and Gardiner holds the same
honor in the amateur class. Maloney
Is very anxious to have the men make
the trip and is confident that the ar
