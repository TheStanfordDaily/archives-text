# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
CONGRESS
The Soldier Bonus Bill is taking up
the full time of the House while the
Senate is struggling with the Four
Power Pact. The Bonus Bill will
probably be passed undei* the gag
rule, tomorrow. In its present form
it will probably be vetoed. The ship
subsidy bill will furnish the next op
portunity for a Congressional battle.
THE BRITISH EMPIRE
The London Press freely predicts
the fall of Lloyd George, whose coa
lition is falling to pieces. The union
ist party meeting refused to give him
a vote of confidence and Lord Derby
has refused to accept Lord Montagu's
place in the Cabinet, unwilling to
board a sinking ship. Disorder in In
dia increases, and the proclamation
of Egyptian independence is marred
by roits. Griffiths and be Valera are
preparing for their fight for the rati
fication of the Irish treaty. De Valera
demands the reunion of the register
of voters, but Griffiths refuses this
on the ground that he is only trying
to delay the general election.
FRANCE AND GERMANYâ€”
The Commission of Control com
plained to the German Government
that Germany is violating the disarma
ment clauses of the treaty. The Ge
noa Conference, which was to lay the
basis for European reconstruction, is
now almost friendless and abandoned.
Russia and Germany have no longer
anything to expect from it, since
America refused to attend.
