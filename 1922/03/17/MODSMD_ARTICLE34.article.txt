LEGE, CORVALUS, Ore., Mar. 17.—
(P. I. N. S.) —The Sheik of Araby was
the ruler of the Co-ed Ball at O. A. C.
"He" was judged to be the cleverest
"snake" present.
The Co-ed Ball is the annual big
"mixer" given by the Women's League,
and is for the purpose of helping the
freshmen girls get acquainted with the
upperclasswomen. The dance is given
in the form of a costume party, and the
freshman girls are escorted by girls of
the sophomore, junior, and senior classes.
