UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
BERKELEY, Cal., Mar. 17.—(P. I. N.
S.) —Quite a flurry of "gold fever"
struck the mining students of the Uni
versity of California the other day when
one of their members discovered a gold
nugget embedded in the street pavement
just off the campus. The nugget passed
the boiling acid test with flying
and a second '49 rush was only avoided
by the fact that the lead proved to be a
strangely isolated case of exposure due
to the recent rains.
