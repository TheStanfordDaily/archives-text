UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Berkeley, Calif., March 17. (P.1.N.5.) â€”
Direct evidence that the Chinese and
Japanese visited the California coast in
the "pre-Columbus" period has been
brought to the University is in the "form
of an ancient Japanese spearhead. It
was found in an Indian burial mound
near Tamales Bay, Marin County.
According to Prof. A. L. Kroeber of
the anthropology department, the spear
head is of ancient origin and a typical
Japanese * shape known as the "true
cross." Near its base is an inscription
partially obliterated by rust, identified
by Prof. Y. S. Ktino of the Japanese
department as being a mixture of Jap
anese and Chinese characters. As near
ly as he can decipher, they are mottoes
of good luck.
