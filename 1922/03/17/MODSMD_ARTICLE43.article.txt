UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Berkeley, Calif.. March 17. (P.1.N.5.) â€”
Don't crowd, boys, but listen to this one:
"Encourage, don't suppress love
among college students," said Prof. E.
J. Breitvveiser of the educational de
partment, today. According, in short,
to the excellent idea of the savant, the
unexcelled opportunities for association
and intermingling of the two sexes in
co-educational institutions is very con
ducive to happy marriages. Love is
natural, _and will do much among col
lege students to offset warped and ex
aggerated ideas of marriage and the op
posite sex.
Remember what Breitwiser says and
let your conscience be your guide.
