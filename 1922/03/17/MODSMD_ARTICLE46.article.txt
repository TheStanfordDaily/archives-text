# CHILI HAMPERED BY POINT OF VIEW
## Different Ideals Found In North and South Continents Says Dr. Galvez 
### 
"Hie essential difference between
North and South America is a difference
in the idealism," said Dr. Jose M. Galvez
in his talk 011 Chile, its culture and its
political problems, in the Little Theatre
last night.
"Christianity has served as the basis
for the idealisms which have developed
so differently in the two countries. In
North America liberty has been the
foundation stone from the very begin
ning. In Chile the government, from a
political point of view, may be republican
but we are all still subjects of an institu
tion. For three hundred years we were
oppressed by Spain, who allowed 110
English Ixioks in Latin America. Chile
is backward today because she is still
holding on to the ideals of the Middle
Ages. Even the lack of competition of
a new idealism has been a serious draw
back."
Galvez explained that the Chileans of
today are a race produced by the blend
ing of the Spaniards who invaded that
part of America and the Araucanian In
dians.
"It is not a Spanish nation, not an In
dian nation, but a Chilean nation with a
patriotism and a loyalty all its own. The
mingling of the Spanish and the In
dians has brought about class distinc
tions. There is the workingman's class,
a small middle class, and a small upper
class which ruled Chile until 1920, when
Alessandri, the first president of the
middle class, was elected."
The civil war, which was a struggle
between the congressional and the presi
dential parties, has resulted in a strict
congressional rule.
. "Our parliament," said Galvez, "is like
a horse without a rein. We need a check
on Congress. We need to check the in
fluence in Congress so as to able to push
through laws which will be for the wel
fare of the country instead of for the
welfare of the few. The present-day
tendency is to put traits of presidential
government into the government of the
land, and to reform the laws of proced
ure in both houses."
