# FURIOUS EXCITEMENT AMONG BOARDERS
## ROBLE WIPES SLEEP FROM EYES AS FIRE BELL CLANGSâ€”AH!!! 
### 
Stillness everywhere.
B-r-r-r-r-!
The lusty lungs of the Roble fire bell
peal forth into the quiet night. Un
initiated freshmen have wild visions of
a fiery death and tumble into the halls,
tearing down to the nearest exits. Others
more blase saunter leisurely to the doors,
laughing and chattering. Some are in
terrupted in slumber, a few from study
ing, others more collegiate reluctantly
leave bridge games and impromptu feeds,
one or two straggle down with damp
locks, hastily withdrawn from soapsuds
and obviously dripping. Everyone looks
at the other and then furtively unfastens
curlers. Little freshmen gasp. Where
are schoolgirl complexions, the fluffy
curls, the ruby lips of the night before?
Are these frowsy females their upper
class idols? But wait! Everyone is
lined up and a roll call is taken. Woe to
the drowsy dreamer who has sought
refuge under the covers. For no one is
excused from this periodic "drill," or
rather display of nightly accoutrements.
Everyone tells everyone else what she
had been doing when the bell clanged;
the question of the hour is, Why are fire
drills? No one can answer this vast and
and mighty question, and girls straggle
thankfully back to their rooms.
Quiet again.
