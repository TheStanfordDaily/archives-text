# Murrays Given God-speed On Journey by Club
## 
### 
That the world still needs ~the old
Greek and Roman ideas and that a
knowledge of the classical languages is
valuable, was emphasized hy Professor
A. T. Murray in his inspiring address
to the Classical Club in the Women's
Clubhouse Wednesday evening.
This meeting was the last one of the
quarter and was held in honor of Pro
fessor and Mrs. Murray, who are leav
ing for the East next week. They will
continue from there to Grece, where
Professor Murray will be the annual
professor at the American School. The
club made them each-a present of a
steamer rug.
