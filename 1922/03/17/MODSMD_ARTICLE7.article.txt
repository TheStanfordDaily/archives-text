# CARDS, OLYMPIC PLAY TOMORROW
## Keneally's Seals Take Game From "Cards" in Hot Contest Yesterday 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the varsity nine
is to tangle for the second time this
season with the Olympic Club team in
what will probably be the last game of
the quarter. On their last invasion of
the campus diamond the Winged "O"
succeeded in shutting out the varsity by
a 3 to 1 score, due chiefly to the air
tight pitching of Ludolf, who held the
Cardinal batsmen to a no-hit game.
Although this game was somewhat hard
on the Cardinals' batting averages, it
gave them some real practice, and it is
enough to say that after batting an
entire game against such a pitcher they
ought to have some insight on what he
lias on the hall and treat it accordingly.
Either A1 Loewenstein or Jim Kelly
will start on the mound against the
Olympics. Loewenstein worked a couple
of innings against Kenealy's Seals yes
terday and will probably be ready to
serve again tomorrow.
Coach Seay will use his regular lineup
for the Saturday game. Green will
probably do the receiving. Patterson,
