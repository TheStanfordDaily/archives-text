# CARDS, OLYMPIC PLAY TOMORROW
## Keneally's Seals Take Game From "Cards" in Hot Contest Yesterday 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the varsity nine
is to tangle for the second time this
season with the Olympic Club team in
what will probably be the last game of
the quarter. On their last invasion of
the campus diamond the Winged "O"
succeeded in shutting out the varsity by
a 3 to 1 score, due chiefly to the air
tight pitching of Ludolf, who held the
Cardinal batsmen to a no-hit game.
Although this game was somewhat hard
on the Cardinals' batting averages, it
gave them some real practice, and it is
enough to say that after batting an
entire game against such a pitcher they
ought to have some insight on what he
lias on the hall and treat it accordingly.
Either A1 Loewenstein or Jim Kelly
will start on the mound against the
Olympics. Loewenstein worked a couple
of innings against Kenealy's Seals yes
terday and will probably be ready to
serve again tomorrow.
Coach Seay will use his regular lineup
for the Saturday game. Green will
probably do the receiving. Patterson,
intosh, Norman, Scofield, and Judah
will give the city men more trouble
than they have experienced in the half
mile in the last two years. Macintosh is
going good, and has an even chance of
winning.
Myers, Ross, Gurey, and Swayne will
start in the mile, and probably finish in
about that order. The Olympic is
strong in both the mile and two mile,
and varsity will do well to place if
Hunter, Churchill, and Forward are all
entered.
Hartranft will be exposed to some real
composition in both the shot-put and
the discus by McGurn of the Olympics.
Given a good day, either of these men
stand an excellent chance of cracking
a record. "Tiny" in particular toys with
the shot to the extent of sixty feet, which
is in the way of making history. Ludeke
and Arthur will decide the extra place
in each event with Snedigar, the dope
favoring Snedigar.
Captain Flint Hanner has been
troubled by a peculiar growth in the
elbow of his throwing arm and will not
be at the top of his form. He could
probably take first place with his arm
in a sling, however. Righetti, who has
made 170 feet, should take Second
place, with Benninger, Wassum, and
Farish disputing the Winged "O" for
third.
Mint Howell will be crowded in the
high jump by the old reliable, Harry
Lachmund, and George Krogness. He
will have to be at his best to win, and
Robison has only an outside chance of
showing up in the summary.
With Krogness and Kelley broad
jumping for the Olympic, Minsky, the
Varsity's best bet, may have to be con
ten' with third place, but Stanford will
be strong in the pole vault, and should
take everything with Wilcox, Black, and
Davis.
in the broad jump.
It is understood that Elmer Boyden,
Vallejo High School star, who single
handed won third place for his school
in the University of Chicago national
interscholastic meet last spring, is to
compete for the Olympic Club. He is
capable of 51 3-5 seconds in the quarter.
1 :58 in the half mile, and jumps well
over 22 feet in the broad jump.
Coach Frank Foster may have other
phenomenal performers that, together
with Boyden, will make the Cardinal
squad perform well in competition.
Charley Paddock, the chief obstacle
to the success of the track team's south
ern trip, has removed himself from the
picture by his Honolulu jaunt, and pros
pects are correspondingly brighter. The
team will leave Stanford Friday night
at 8 o'clock. The meet is scheduled for
2:30 Saturday afternoon.
Just what the University of Southern

California team will be able to do
against Stanford's new stars is uncer
tain, but it is expected that good com
petition will be met with Schulled and
Blaylock in the dashes, Raab and Rog
ers in the hurdling events, Leahy in the
quarter-mile, Rodgers in the pole-vault,
and Boyle and Evans in the shot-put
and discus-throw.
No other engagements in the south
have been arranged and it is expected
that the team will return to the campus
on Sunday.
