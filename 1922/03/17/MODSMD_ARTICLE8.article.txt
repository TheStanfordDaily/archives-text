# PUGS WOULD RE-STAGE FALL OF TROJANS
## Stanford Team Will Entrain For South With Other Athletes 
### 
The Cardinal Boxers are ready for
their invasion of the south, where
they will meet the University of
Southern California pugilists. Seven
men will make the trip, leaving Fri
day evening. They will first box on
the 25th in the new pavilion at U. S. C.
The men who will represent Stanford
are Tommy Bowles, '23, featherweight
division; Kenny Shipp, '23, bantam
weight; Jimmy Ross, '23, lightweight;
Bill Burkhurdt, '23, welterweight;
Walter Wassum, '24, middleweight;
and Mark Evans, '20, light heavy
weight. Either Wals Bills or Johnnie
Lane will also make the trip and box
an exhibition before the main events.
The varsity glove swingers are con
fident since their win over California
last week, and expect to register sev
eral .knockouts in the course of the
evening.
The exact, strength of the Trojans is
unknown but they are scheduled to
meet the California Bears tomorrow,
March 17. Fairbanks won the cham
pionship in his weight last year and
is expected to repeat his performance
in this year's intercollegiate meets.
U. S. C. is known to have some heavy
punchers and doubtlessly Stanford s
men will return to the campus with
at least a black eye or two. The U.
S. C. warriors of the fistic arena are
Pillette, bantamweight; Eddie Mattis,
lightweight; Bob Hendy, welterweight;
Bill Fairbanks, middlewight and Co
villo or Pythian, heavyweights.
The Cardinals have been taking it
easy since their matches with the
Bears, and light workouts were all
that were ordered by Coach Maloney.
Tonight, however, they will be given
a few rounds of hard work to put them
on edge. Jimmy Ross, who hurt his
hand in his match with Einzig, will
be ready to enter the ring again.
Ross's win over Einzig, who won the
national intercollegiate championship
last year, stamps him as a dangerous
man. He depends to a large extent
upon his right uppercut but carries a
kick in either hand. He should win
his match in easy fashion.
Kenny Shipp, who proved his abili
ty, by his decisive victory over Allen,
California's negro phenomenon, will
again be on deck. Shipp has shown
that he can take punishment. . In
both his match with California and
the elimination contests he stopped
some hard blows, but did not become
groggy at any time. The other mem
bers of the team all showed their
ability in the bouts with California and
should make things very interesting
for the Trojans. The wrestling team
will also go to Los Angeles this va
cation to meet the Trojans. It will
leave Wednesday the 29th and matches
take place the following day in the
basketball pavilion.

Lane will also make the trip and box
an exhibition before the main events.
The varsity glove swingers are con
fident since their win over California
last week, and expect to register sev
eral .knockouts in the course of the
evening.
The exact, strength of the Trojans is
unknown but they are scheduled to
meet the California Bears tomorrow,
March 17. Fairbanks won the cham
pionship in his weight last year and
is expected to repeat his performance
in this year's intercollegiate meets.
U. S. C. is known to have some heavy
punchers and doubtlessly Stanford s
men will return to the campus with
at least a black eye or two. The U.
S. C. warriors of the fistic arena are
Pillette, bantamweight; Eddie Mattis,
lightweight; Bob Hendy, welterweight;
Bill Fairbanks, middlewight and Co
villo or Pythian, heavyweights.
The Cardinals have been taking it
easy since their matches with the
Bears, and light workouts were all
that were ordered by Coach Maloney.
Tonight, however, they will be given
a few rounds of hard work to put them
on edge. Jimmy Ross, who hurt his
hand in his match with Einzig, will
be ready to enter the ring again.
Ross's win over Einzig, who won the
national intercollegiate championship
last year, stamps him as a dangerous
man. He depends to a large extent
upon his right uppercut but carries a
kick in either hand. He should win
his match in easy fashion.
Kenny Shipp, who proved his abili
ty, by his decisive victory over Allen,
California's negro phenomenon, will
again be on deck. Shipp has shown
that he can take punishment. . In
both his match with California and
the elimination contests he stopped
some hard blows, but did not become
groggy at any time. The other mem
bers of the team all showed their
ability in the bouts with California and
should make things very interesting
for the Trojans. The wrestling team
will also go to Los Angeles this va
cation to meet the Trojans. It will
leave Wednesday the 29th and matches
take place the following day in the
basketball pavilion.
The Cardinal Boxers are ready for
their invasion of the south, where

Southern California pugilists. Seven

day evening. They will first box on
the 25th in the new pavilion at U. S. C.
The men who will represent Stanford

and Mark Evans, '20, light heavy
weight. Either Wals Bills or Johnnie
Lane will also make the trip and box
an exhibition before the main events.
