# New Stanford Union to Throw Open Its Doors on April 1st
## GIFT OF ANONYMOUS DONOR ALMOST COMPLETED 
### 
The new Student Union, long the
source of much campus interest, will be
thrown open on April 1, this date mark
ing the completion of one of the great
est utilitarian works undertaken on the
campus in recent years. Crowded living
conditions and unsatisfactory eating
facilities have for some time been
problems on the campus, and the open
ing of the new Union will at least par
tially solve them.
By far the greatest significance of the
opening, in the minds of the Board of
Governors, is that the New Union will
provide additional opportunities "for so
cial intercourse between all campus
groups, which were lacking in the old
Union. The chtbroom of the new struc
ture will be thrown open at the same
time as the rest of the building. The
control of the clubroom billiard rooms,
library, and of the various other depart
ments of the Union will be taken out
of student hands and placed in those
of a permanent steward. Smoking will
not be allowed in the transient dining
room.
Board at the new Union will be ap
proximately $30 a for those
who will take all meals there. In addi
tion, facilities will be provided whereby
the transient diner may eat any of a
varied combination of dishes, designed

to suit all tastes and prices. Fourteen
permanent cooks will be kept at the
Union, with necessary assistants, and
one professional waiter will take charge
in his department. All will he furnished
with fresh uniforms daily, cleanliness
being the prime virtue of the culinary
department.
Milk for the dining room will be sent
to the Union from Watsonville, where
a Stanford alumnus keeps a herd of
certified dairy cows. The baking facili
ties are large enough to supply the needs
of the whole campus.
Conferences are now being held with
the idea of making the Union the cen
tral link in a commissary system which
will supply all of the fraternities and
living groups, as well as the eating
clubs, thus obviating much duplication
of facilities and handling of food for
which the Stanford student now pays.
Miss Handy, dietary expert, who will be
in charge of the dining room and kitchen
purchasing, has for some time been
at the Union, and who will supervise its
supervising the outfitting of the eating
facilities at the Union, and will prob
ably be in charge of the new commissary
system when its details are perfected.
A special organization room will be
maintained in the new Union, which
will be available to all societies without
Ratner, or Woodward are to take care
of things around initial sack. Peavy will
cover second and Maillot is the logical
man for the shortstop position. Heck
endorf will play third base position. In
the outfield there are Carver, Parker,
Woodward, Wayland, Coldthurst, and
Ratner as possibilities.
The game will be called at 3:15 sharp.
Admission is 25 cents or student body
cards.
In one of the hardest fought games
ever witnessed by campus baseball fans,
Kenealy s Seals from San Francisco
nosed out ahead of the varsity nine by a
4-to-3 score yesterday afternoon on the
I'reshtnan field, the game going eleven
innings. The score stood at 1-all up to
the eighth frame, when a batting rally
by the Cards gave them a 3-to-l lead,
but in their half of the ninth the Seals
caine back and again dead-locked the
score, taking two extra innings to de
cide the fracas. Nothing happened in
the tenth, but in the first of the eleventh
the Seals managed to squeeze across the
winning tally which the Stanford men
were unable to overcome.
1 he chief reason of the Seals' success
can be attributed to the slugging powers
which Johnny Kerr, wiry little shortstop
of the visitors, displayed. In five trips
to the plate Kerr gleaned a couple of
triples, a double and a single, the re
maining time being accounted for by a
sacrifice play. Such a record is almost
enough to win any ball game, and it is
enough to say that Johnny should he able
to get the proverbial goat of almost any
pitcher.
Art Nef worked on the mound for the
varsity during the nine innings and was
replaced by Loewenstein, who finished
the game. Nef held the visitors to seven
hits, with four of them coming off the
hat of Kerr. The visitors obtained two
hits off Loewenstein in the eleventh
which clinched the game.
