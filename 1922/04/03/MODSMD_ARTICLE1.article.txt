# FOOTBALL PRACTICE STARTS TODAY
## Warner and Thornhill Begin Spring Grid Work "Pop" wants every possible man out for berths on 1922 eleven 
### 
Stanford's football machine was set in motion this afternoon at 2 o'clock,
by "Pop" Warner and Claude Thornhill, who will have charge of its opera
tion during the four or five weeks of the spring work-out.
Many of the varsity and freshmen players of last year have already signed
up for practice, but "Pop" Warner urged that any one who has any knowl
edge of the game, and men weighing 175 pounds or more, turn out for coach
ing. The game will be taken up in its more rudimentary forms; kicking,
tackling, blocking, and towards the last of the season, a few simple plays,
will occupy the attention of the coaches and men.
Practice will progress only as fast as the men master the details of the
work gone over. Men who have had no experience will be assisted in every
way possible to learn the game, and Warner is especially anxious to have
new men out for training.
Thornhill will be left in charge of coaching activities upon the return

of Warner to the East in October, With
Andy Kerr as his assistant. Kerr will
not come to the coast until the be
ginning of the autumn quarter.
Most of the men who turned out for
practice this afternoon have been
fitted with uniforms, and practice will
begin in the Stadium tomorrow. The
first few days will be devoted to limb
ering up stiff muscles and recovering
lost wind.
Some of the players are at present
busy with the regular spring activities,
and will not be out until later 011 in
the season. Many of last year's var
sity have signified their intention of
coming out for practice.
"Dud" DeGroot, captain of the 1922
varsity will not be 011 the campus for
a day or two. Woodward, Betts, Hart
ranft, Arthur, Stice, Ludeke, Sproule,
Wilcox and Hey will all be in uniform
this quarter. From last year's fresh
man team will come a great deal of
good material. Jannsen, Cuddeback,
Dennis, Dick Lausen, Jim Lausen,
Middleton, Shipkey, Dole, Johnson,
Gilliland, McCrorie, and Hooper, have
signed up.
