# CARDINAL TRACK SQUAD WINS EASY VICTORIES; TO MEET SOUTHERN STARS
## 
### 
Track luminaries from the Southern
California Conference to the number of
twenty-live, their reputations blemished
by a crushing 114 to 26 defeat at the
hands of California Saturday, will stop
off at Stanford Wednesday afternoon to
combat the Cardinal speed burners.
On paper the southern stars look good
enough to furnish some real competition,
but they failed to impress in their first
showing at Berkeley. Stroud in the 880
was the only visitor to annex a first
place, although Payne tied McDonald of
the Bruins in the quarter.
Elmer Elliott, crack miler of the 1923
freshman squad, whom the faculty ruled
off last season, has returned and should
bolster up Stanford's weakness in the
distance events. Rhigetti, who has been
hurling the javelin around the 170-foot
mark consistently, has been declared in
eligible for the varsity and will probably
compete for the freshmen.
Payne, a long rangy chap who, the ex
perts declare, ought to be the world's
champion 440 man. but isn't, will hook
up with "Blink" Williamson Wednesday

in the feature race of the afternoon.
Payne takes a long stride, and always
finishes fresh, but for sonic reason has
been unable to run under -.50 2-5 seconds.
Argue and Allen, the sprinters of the
southern delegation, have marks of 10
flat to their credit in the hundred, but
unless they have improved since last
Saturday, they will gather in no first
places. Sudden and Hartranft ought to
finish one-two in the century.
Southern papers credit Allen with
marEs of 15 seconds flat in the 120
hurdles and 241-5 seconds in the low
hurdle event, but he was beaten by Hen
derson of California in the high barriers.
Rounds and Riddcrhoff will also repre
sent the invaders in the hurdles.
Goodenough went 12 feet 6 inches in
the pole vault at Berkeley Saturday, and
if he is in as good form when he meets
the Cardinal vaulters he should win
handily. Sloan, who covers the ground
fairly fast despite a peculiar stride, has
done the two miles in 10 minutes 8 sec
onds, and he will hardly have as much
competition here as at Berkeley.
