# CARDINAL BOXERS WIN TOURNAMENT
## Trojan Pugilists Lose Three of Five Bouts to Stanford; Eddie Mathies Ineligible 
### D.E. Liebendorfer, '24 
Stanford's varsity boxers 'stamped
themselves as the best in the state and
possibly the best on the coast by winning
three of five matches from the University
of Southern California pugilists last
Tuesday evening in Los Angeles.' The
Cards have defeated their two strongest
opponents, the University of California
and the University of Southern Cali
fornia.
Shipp started things in the opening
bout of the evening at Los Angeles by
defeating Gillette, who holds a win over
Sol Silverman, the fast Blue and Gold
bantamweight. Shipp carried the fight
to his opponent from the first and had
the edge during the entire bout. He used
his left to good advantage and constantly
crossed over with his dangerous right.
1 lie bell saved Gillette from a knockout
in the third round.
Eddie Mathies, who defeated Einzig,
the California lightweight, was declared
a professional, but he .was matched with
Johnnie Lane in an exhibition bout.
Jimmie Ross was slated to fight Matties,
but the Card lightweight had his hand
broken and re-set the day before the
matches and was unable to appear. In
his bout with Matties, Lane put up the
best fight of the evening. Toe to toe
lighting during the entire match resulted
in a tough baitle. The first round went
per. This will make it possible to
operate on one shift and materially
cut the overhead expense at the start.
The kitchen of the new building
has every possible modern contrivance
for efficient service. Electricity oper
ates the refrigerating plant in the
basement which has a cooling capacity
of sufficient radius to keep the meats,
vegetables, and other perishable foods
of the Union and also cool other
rooms for extra foods and meats.
Electric meat cutters, dough mixers,
and potato parers are added parts of
the new equipment.
A complete bakery has been put in
at the rear of the kitchen, where prac
tically all the pastries served will be
made. This is a separate department
from the kitchen and is under indivi
dual management.
In the main kitchen everything is
of the most modern type. The big oil
blast stove is fronted by a hotel size
steam table from which service will
be made and in back of the stove are
the steam cookers. An electric broiler
will be placed alongside of these soon.
Dishwashing will be automatically
done in the steam washer.
The salad room is completely equip
ped as a separate part of the kitchen
with individual care and with a refrige
ration system of its own. Nothing has
been spared to make the new restau
rant the latest and most efficient pos
sible.
A thoroughly trained staff will
handle the preparation of the food.
The chef is from the Hotel Clark in
Stockton. He has two assistants di
rectly under him and the baker and
butcher are in addition. Most of the
kitchen work will be done by outside
help, but the serving of the diners will
be done by student hashers, there be
ing about thirty-five of these. The
capacity will be about 1200 meals per
day under the present schedule of ser
vice.
Room rents will be handled through
the office in the Union although Miss
Handy will not have direct charge of
the dormitory part.
The drapes for the lobby have been
delayed in transit from the east and
so the main salon will not be ready
for occupancy until the latter part of
the week at the earliest. All other
rooms are done now however and
have been nearly all furnished. Those
who require additional pieces of furni
ture may apply for them at the store
room in the corporation yard.
Men who wish to take advantage of
the American plan rate and who do
not belong to one of the already form
ed eating clubs are asked to notify
Miss Handy at her office at once so
that she may make up the seating lists
and see how many of the small rooms
are to be occupied.
