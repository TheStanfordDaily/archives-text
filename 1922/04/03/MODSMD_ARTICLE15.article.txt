# New Stanford Union Opens Limited Dining Room Today
## Dining Hall in Basement of Old Union Building to Serve Meals This Week 
### 
The New Union opened today to all its dwellers as far as rooms are con
-1 cerned, and to a limited extent started the dining facilities. Some of the
rooms have been occupied for several weeks by men who have been without
other possible place of lodging but the general move-in has been made over
the week-end.
Miss Etta Handy who has charge of all the dining room facilities of the
Union has reserved the club dining rooms for the members of the eatiruj
clubs which have been using the Inn for the last quarter, because the Inn is
now closed. Men who are living in the new Union and want to take advantage
of the reduced date that will be in effect for those wishing steady board are
asked to see Miss Handy at her office of the Union, tomorrow, to make ar
rangements. These men will have the use of the smaller club dining rooms
whether they eat as club members or in small groups.
The big dining room will not be opened until thq latter part of the week
on account of the rush incidental to the opening of the new place and due
also to the fact that the refrigerating system is not completely installed.
When the work is done on this everything will be ready as far as the restau
rant part of the Union goes and the main dining hall will be opened to the

general public. This will be run on
a la carte basis and the table d'hote
as well, but the regular boarders will
not use this room. It will be for the
transient trade on account of the fact
that this will allow the serving of
several sets of meals from this one
room for every dinner and supper.
The Inn is closed now but the din
ing room In the old Union will be in
operation until the main room of the
new building is opened to the public.
Mr. Tagawa who had planned to close
his dining room yesterday has arrang
ed to stay open until the day when the
new Union can be completely started.
When the old dining room is closed
it will not be immediately remodeled
for a lunch counter as was the origin
al plan, because it appears that the
lie wkitchen will be able to serve all
those formerly supplied by both the
Union and the Inn. The meal hours
will not be continuous but about two
for breakfast from 7 to 9, from 12 to
1 for dinner, and from 6 to 7 for sup
to Matties, the second to Lane, and the
third was even. The judges called the
match a draw and in the fourth Lane
lost the decision after making a whirl
wind start. Lane outweighed his man
fifteen pounds.
Bill Burkhard met a tough opponent
in Fairbanks. The first two rounds were
almost even, with Fairbanks slightly in
the lead, but in the third Burkhard staged
a comeback which won him the decision.
"Husky" Wassum, fighting the best
battle of his career, knocked Covino out
in the third round of a match which was
Wassum's from the first. Wassum scored
two knockdowns in the first round and
took it easy in the second. In the third,
Wassum landed one in the first few
seconds which sent Covino down for the
count.
In Pythian, Mark Evans met one of

the best men in his class on the coast.
Pythian is a powerful lighter who knows
how to use his mitts well. He out
weighed Evans twenty pounds. In the
first round, the milling was fast with
Pythian in the lead. In the second, the
big fellow landed a blow which floored
Evans. Although Evans was on his feet
again and going strong, he was no match
for his opponent, and Pythian knocked
him out with a left hook to the chin ten
seconds later.
