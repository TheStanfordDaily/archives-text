# GETTING THE JUMP
## 
### 
Today we start on the final quarter of the year
and what is to many of us the final lap of our college
career. Ten weeks, and every one of them full of
athletic and social events that will take much of our
time in spite of good resolutions to make up this
time for the slips we made last quarter. Spring
quarter is conceded by all the varsity conceders to
be the hardest one of the year, when all hands look
for the lunch courses, so that each one may spend
his hours drifting about on the lake, working on the
football field, or engaged in some other sport, and
still come out at the end with an admission ticket to
another quarter's performance. Occasionally, how
ever, one hears of the man who says he made his
best marks in a spring quarter. When you come
right down to facts there isn't any reason why such
should not be the case. The weather is the best of
the year. It is a temptation to spend much time out
of doors. This does not necessarily keep one from
making good marks, because it tends to put one's
physical self in good shape, and then it is easier to
do the routine work that goes with study and to
arrange things so that when the end of the quarter
is reached there is not fear of the examination. You
have the basic part of the work down cold and a
little review puts you in a place where you can make
the grade and come out with a good mark.
The O. A. C. Barometer says that the student
who "gets the jump" on the course has no fear of it.
Those who have tested out this theory know that in
most cases this is the truth, where you go to the first
few lectures and are ready to go on with the course
without a bad grade hanging on to drag down the
final average. The way that you go at any job is
half the fight. If you get in good licks at the first
you have things your own way to a considerable ex
tent and the end is easier for the initial spurt.
With a term as full as the present we have to get
after the studies the first week or we'll have a
mighty hard time when the ten weeks are up. Don't
make a resolution, just start and keep going.
