# SPRING PRACTICE
## 
### 
Spring football practice officially opened today
under the guidance of Glen Warner and C. E.
Thornhill. Candidates for the varsity squad are to
have their first opportunity to meet on their own
field these men who have done much to make foot
ball first among intercollegiate sports.
Both Warner and Thornhill come to Stanford,
after years of expert coaching, fully realizing the
task that confronts them. A machine must be built
up at Stanford which will defeat the best the West
has produced in many seasons; a machine with a
system behind it that looks forward to years of
football success.
There is but one thing Stanford men can do in
the direct method of co-operation with the new
coaches; they must enter whole-heartedly into the
spirit of the new regime, determined to do and learn
everything in their power to achieve the final definite
aim of every footmall team —ultimate victory.
And to achieve this, every possible candidate for the
greatest of all sports must appear for practice.
Nothing more could be done to reassure the new
staff than to show a hundred per cent turnout the
first day.
Stanford has the men, the material, the money,
the will to win, and the coaches. The first season of
practice preparatory to making these elements one

compound starts today. There can he no doubt
that every man will give the best.
