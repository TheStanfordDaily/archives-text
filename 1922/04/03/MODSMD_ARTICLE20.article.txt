# MATERIALIZING DREAMS
## 
### 
In the new Union opening today we see the first
lap finished in the new building program. In nine
months, during which time there has been first one
thing and then another in the nature of labor trouble,
and delayed shipments, the new building has been
erected and today stands as the completing part of
the original Union plan that was put into operation
when the first two buildings of the group were built.
The final step in the completion of the group was
made possible largely through the gift of an
anonymous donor, a member of the ever-growing
Stanford family.
The new building as it stands today is one of the
most complete dormitory hotels that can be found on
any campus. Living accommodations for between
100 and 150 men are furnished in the sleeping part
of the building, and on the first floor is the big lobby
for lounging and the several dining rooms.
For restaurant service the new Union will be hard
to surpass. Every modern kitchen help to speed up
service and to make the food attractive has been
installed and the dining rooms will be run on a non
profit basis by the University, so as to bring the
meal service to students at the lowest possible cost.
Those who live in the Union will have the privilege
of a reduced American plan rate, as will the clubs
who are formed for regular meals. In the main
dining room the transient will find either a la carte
or table d'hote service.
Miss Etta Handy, who will manage the restaurant
service, is specially trained in the line of restaurant
management, and she has the best culinary talent
available to help her with her work. The force in
the kitchen, meat shop, and bakery has been secured
from high-class establishments, and nothing has suf
fered from any lack of equipment in any of the
departments.
Twelve hundred meals can be served each day by
the present staff, and that ought to fill our long-felt
want for a while.
