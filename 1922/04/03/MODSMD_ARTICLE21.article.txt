The start of the Quarter —if you're through by 4:40
(this afternoon), you're lucky. There are some who
can do it in 49 seconds flat, but most of us prefer to take
fifteen hours.
* • •
What to take, or rather, What not to Take, is now
the question. Usually there is lots of advice on what
to take. Therefore Cabbages offers a few suggestions
on What Not to Take this Quarter. Look 'em over care
fully, and avoid each and every one.
• • •
Political Science 89: Elements of Plumbing. No, this
is not a pipe course, but you have to have your tools
to get through the Ave hours.
History 19: Mannerisms of the Speed Cop. A prac
tical course, with hours at any time of the day or night.
Syllabus fees are likely to be large.
Philosophy 77: Ratiocinational Hallucinations. Too
simple to waste time on, and too complicated to study.
Graphic Art 457: Second Story Work: Too much
laboratory work at late hours. Complications with the
authorities likely.
Mathematics: 80b: Raising Bank Checks. For ad
vanced students only. Prerequisite: Art 78. Theory of
Erasing. » « »
Latest song hit among the campus cooks: I've Al
ways stood for the Open Shop—But I Work on the
Union Range."
* * *
Everyone who hasn't taken a personally conducted
tour through the kitchen of the new Union should do
it several minutes ago, or at least, at once. You get all
the sensations of seeing and thinking of food without
having to pay for it. Don't get locked in the refrige
rators, though. Palmolive Pete claims he felt like an
Eskimo Pie before he got out.
♦ * *
Coming some time in the dear future is the great All-
Star-Cabbage Troup of World-Wondrous Strong Men.
A special attraction; seat sale will be at the lake. (If
that's too deep, go on to the next).
m * *
JOSEF TENDON: Clever and agile. He can balance
his bank account for three days running.
BULL-BULL, the Australian Dog-Man. Wonderful
poyer in his forearms. Once straightened out a do
mestic tangle, and has been known to twist a quotation.

A VIEWPOINT
Revered Sir: —I don't see why there- are so many
early birds on this campus because my first quarter here
I got up early to register and got down at eight o'clock
and there was a line so long I wasted half an hour
hour finding where it started and the next quarter I
got down at a quarter of eight and bumped into a line
that looked like a seat sale to "Why Girls Leave Home,"
and then the next quarter I was going to be sure so
I set three alarm clocks and got down to the Admin.
Bldg. at seven thirty and this time I froze for half an
hour with only 200 guys ahead of me and what I want
to know is why I got registered so quickly today when
I over slept and didn't get up till after noon and Ben
Franklin said early to rise all right but he didn't say
early to register. Yours for better living conditions —
YOU WON'T KNOW MY NAME.
♦ * +
The President of Princeton sent a circular letter to
all parents of undergraduates, urging that the students
be denied the use of private automobiles while on the
campus. He immediately received almost one hundred
personal letters of commendation and congratulation
from all parts of the country.
Ninety-six of them were said to be from bicycle manu
facturers.

A VIEWPOINT
Revered Sir: —I don't see why there- are so many
early birds on this campus because my first quarter here
I got up early to register and got down at eight o'clock
and there was a line so long I wasted half an hour
hour finding where it started and the next quarter I
got down at a quarter of eight and bumped into a line
that looked like a seat sale to "Why Girls Leave Home,"
and then the next quarter I was going to be sure so
I set three alarm clocks and got down to the Admin.
Bldg. at seven thirty and this time I froze for half an
hour with only 200 guys ahead of me and what I want
to know is why I got registered so quickly today when
I over slept and didn't get up till after noon and Ben
Franklin said early to rise all right but he didn't say
early to register. Yours for better living conditions —
YOU WON'T KNOW MY NAME.
