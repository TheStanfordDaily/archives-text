While the Senate, having ratified all
the pacts of the Washington Conference,
takes up the Bonus Bill for considera
tion, the House quarrels over the Naval
Appropriation Bill, with its drastic
economies cutting down our naval per
sonnel to 65,000 men. Both measures
are clearly out of harmony with the
policies of the Administration, and both
of them have the appearance of vote
getting measures, drafted with a view
to the November elections rather than to
any sound or far-sighted policy. Op
ponents of the naval cut declare that it
reduces the American navy to an effec
tive strength equal to half that which was
permitted by the Five-Power Pact. The
Bonus Bill is clearly not in harmony
with sound principles of finance or of
banking. Ex-service men will be given
certificates upon which banks will be au
thorized to loan money up to one-half
the value of the ceitiiicate. The bill is
drawn in the hope tha* most of the men
will make guch loans, and upon failure
to repay them in time, forfeit their right
to the full face value of the certificate.
In any case, the ex-soldiers will receive
something before the taxpayers are asked
to pay anything, so that no political reck
oning need be made till after the elec
tions.
The truce between Protestants and
Catholics in Ulster, in which the North
ern Government and the Free State had
gone further than ever before in making
concessions, even to the extent of pro
viding for Catholic policemen in Belfast
—was shattered last night in a series of
murders and shootings which have set
a new limit in violence. Ihe reaction
from the disorders in Belfast is felt all
over Ireland. De Valera declared that
the Free State Treaty was "already a
scrap of paper in Ulster. Two thou
sand members of the Irish Republican
Army refused to take a modified oath
which would have bound them to the
new Government. Along the border of
Ulster more shooting occurred. It is
evident that there is a large part of the
Republican Army over which the Free
State Government has no control.
