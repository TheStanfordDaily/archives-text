University of California will be held
Friday evening, April 14, on the Cali
fornia campus. The general subject
which both teams are now working on is
"France at the Washington Conference."
Two hours before the debate is called,

son, debating coach, the chances of a
Stanford man returning with the medal
are very good.
"We have this year," said Professor
Emerson, "three good men on the team.
Each is a different type of speaker, and
all are good exponents of their particu
lar style.
"In Robert Binkley, '22, we have a
man of broad academic experience. Bink
ley has spent some years in France as
attache of the Hoover War Collection,
and he is familiar with French prob
lems, especially war and post-war prob
lems.
"Knox Miller, '23, is an effective
speaker. He can be depended upon for
a thoroughly analyzed and well delivered
discussion.
"In Bertrand Comparet, '24, we have
the logician of the trio. And in case that
any of these speakers is incapacitated,
we have a very able alternate in Edward
Landels, '21. Landels is a very thor
ough student of economic theory, and
lias the ability to apply that theory in
any case that might arise in the debate."
