# STANFORD MATMEN ARE VICTORS OVER U.S.C. WRESTLERS
## 
### 
Stanford's wrestling team decisively
defeated the U. S. C. grapplers by win
ning three of the five bouts on falls and
getting a draw and forfeit on the other
two, at the U. S. C. pavilion, Thursday,
March 30. There were no stars on the
Cardinal team, for all the men displayed
consistent work. With the exception of
Hori, the Japanese wrestler of U. S. C.,
the southern university team offered little
opposition to the Stanford grapplers.
Sturm, featherweight of Stanford, met
a tough proposition in the form of Hori,
but, despite the latter's quickness and
trickiness, was able to emerge from the
tilt with a draw. Both men spent most
of the time trying to get a hold, but
neither was successful. Hori threw
Sturm to the mat twice, but was unable
to follow up his advantage and pin
Sturm's shoulders to the canvas. It was
necessary for the men to wrestle an ex
tra three minutes to decide the draw, but
at the end of this time neither had se
cured the advantage an dthe match was
declared a draw.
Hosepian lived up to his reputation of
throwing his man in short order. He
stepped into the ring, spent a few sec
onds in securing a head-lock on Porter,
the U. S. C. grappler's head, and threw
him within 43 seconds. The men weighed
in at 135 pounds.
Mercer, 145-pounder, had little trouble
in disposing of his opponent. Holquist.
The Cardinal grappler waited until he
had secured his deadly body scissors and
then with an arm-lock secured a fall
after three minutes of,wrestling.
U. S. C. had no 158-pounder to meet
Johnson, but sent in Pasthori, who
weighed 147 pounds. Pasthori evidently
did not want to meet the fate of his two
teammates, for he spent a large part of
his efforts in crawling off the canvas.
Johnson was able, however, to hold him
on the mat long enough to secure a fall.
When McKee, Stanford light-heavy
weight, appeared on the scene, he found
that there was no one to meet him, as
U. S. C. had no man in his class. This
match was forfeited, but Bragg, the
referee and wrestling instructor of the
Y. M. C. A., agreed to meet McKee in an
exhibition match. Bragg wanted the
match decided by two falls out of three,
but McKee disappointed him, for he pre
vented him from securing any falls.
Bragg's fancy work proved unsuccessful
and the match was declared a draw.
Referee, Harry Maloney.
