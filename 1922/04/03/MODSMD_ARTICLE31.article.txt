# TRACK VICTORIES
## 
### 
Two one-sided victories —the first
one a surprise to Stanford followers
—and some hard work are what the
Cardinal track and field aggregation
has to show for the ten-day vacation
period.
Ideal spring weather and a fast
track had a hand in the betten-than
ordinary marks hung up by Temple
ton's performers in the 92 to 39 win
over the Olympic Club, March 18.
While "Tiny" Hartranft was heaving
the shot 50 feet 3-8 of inch, his mates
trampled on the Winged "0"s repre
sentatives in every event except the
distance runs and the broad jump.
Falk took both of the hurdle events
from Krogness, former Harvard star,
winning the lows in :25 1-5 seconds.
Howell cleared 6 feet 2 inches in the
high jump; Hanner threw the discus
186 feet; Sudden stepped the 220 in
:21 3-5 seconds; Williamson travelled
the quarter in :50 4-5 seconds; Wil
cox won the pole vault at 12 feet 1
inch —those were the marks that sent
the bleacherites away feeling that the
Cardinal track season was off to an
auspicious start.
Cardinal track and field men an
nounced their arrival in Los Angeles
on March 25 by triumphing over the
U. S. C. squad of time and space an
nihil'ators, 85 to 46.
"Tiny" Hartranft *'as the star per
former of the day with three firsts and
a third. Hartranft opened the festivi
ties by tossing the 16-pound shot 49
feet, 7 1-2 inches, eight feet betten
than Evans of U. S. C. The hundred
yard dash came off about that time,
and the Stanford giant went over to
the cinderpath and ran away from his
competitors in 10 seconds flat. He
then set a new coast record in the dis
discus of 147 feet 1 1-2 inches, and
finished the afternoon with a third in
the 220 yard dash.
The biggest point-winners" for the
Trojans were George Schiller and
"Cap" Rogers. Schiller captured the
quarter mile in 50 1-5 seconds with
Williamson and Judali of the Cards
on his trail, and then tore off a 220-
yard run in 22 2-5 seconds. Rogers
nosed out Falk in the 220 yard low
hurdles, winning in 26 fiat, and won
the broad jump with a lunge of 22
feet 1 1-4 inches.
Raney was the only other U. S. C.
man to take a first place. Falk led
the Trojan to the tape but was dis
qualified for tipping over too many
hurdles.
