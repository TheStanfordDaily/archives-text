# VARSITY SWIMMING TEAM IS DEFEATED BY LOS ANGELES CLUB
## 
### 
A1 White, heralded as the future
diving champion, and Charlie Fletcher,
the tall breast-stroke phenom, annexe !
the only first places for Stanford in the
meet with the Los Angeles Athletic
Club in the south. Outside - of these
two, the Cardinal paddlers hardly
measured up to the class of the Mer
cury stars, and they were beaten, 43 to
14.
The L. A. A. C. relay quarter, main
ly through the efforts of Tom Blake,
set a new Pacific Coast mark of 1 min
ute 3 3-5 seconds in that event. That
same Blake had quite a bit to do with
the Cardinal downfall, as he also won
from the field in the 100 and 220' free
style races.
Klebalin, the freshman sprinter,
came in third in the 50; Austin took
third in the 100; DeGroot was third
in the back stroke; and Wooster made
one point in the 220 free style. That
was the extent of the Cardinal scor
ing, and the Mercury swimmers had
things their own way in the remainder
of the places.
