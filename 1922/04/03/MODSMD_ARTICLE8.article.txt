# VARSITY PREPARES FOR FIRST GAME WITH CALIFORNIA
## Diamond Squad Has Vacation Practice Games, Few Shifts Made in Regular Line-up 
### 
In preparation for next Saturday's
diamond contest with California, the
varsity nine spent the vacation in games
and practice. Three games with outside
teams were played, Stanford winning
one and losing two. Some shifts made
in the line-up, however, and constant
practice this week, are both factors that
will tend to make the first of the three
game series with the Blue and Gold far
from being a one-sided affair.
Playing Santa Clara Monday afternoon
on a muddy diamond, with rain interfer
ing throughout the contest, the varsity
lost, 6-3, after gaining a two-run lead in
the first inning. Nef and Loewenstein
did the hurling. The second game was
an old-time twelve-inning battle with the
Kcnealy Seals. Up to the ninth inning
the invaders had the game sewed up, 1-0,
but a last-inning rally by Seay's men
tied the score. In the twelfth Draper
won his own game with a triple, scoring
Green. Draper allowed the hard-hitting
Seals only five hits ni the twelve innings.
The third game of the season with the
Olympic Club was staged Saturday, and
for th(*third time the clubmen went home
victorious, the final score being 3-1.
Loewenstein pitched the entire game, al
lowing six hits.
The latest line-up has a few changes
from that of last quarter. Woodward,
who has been playing at short, in the
outfield, and at third, has been moved
over to first, and from present indica
tions will stay there. Peavy is handling
second base regularly, and Maillot has
covered short consistently during the
last five games. With Woodward on
first, Heckendorf has resumed his old
stand at third. The outfield has finally
settled down to Carver, Wayland, and
Parker, all of them dangerous men with
the bat.
Captain George Green has been catch
ing regularly in all of the games, and
lias added a world of power to the line
up. Ratner, who caught while Green's
leg was mending, is used as a pinch hit
ter, and has come through in this role
more than once.
Draper still remains the most depend
able pitcher on the squad, and as the sea
son advances his wing improves. His
twelve-inning game against Kenealy's
Seals was a good example of mid-season
form. Seay has been using Loewenstein
and Nef in the box during the vacation.

but a last-inning rally by Seay's men
tied the score. In the twelfth Draper
won his own game with a triple, scoring
Green. Draper allowed the hard-hitting
Seals only five hits ni the twelve innings.
The third game of the season with the
Olympic Club was staged Saturday, and
for th(*third time the clubmen went home
victorious, the final score being 3-1.
Loewenstein pitched the entire game, al
lowing six hits.
The latest line-up has a few changes
from that of last quarter. Woodward,
who has been playing at short, in the
outfield, and at third, has been moved
over to first, and from present indica
tions will stay there. Peavy is handling
second base regularly, and Maillot has
covered short consistently during the
last five games. With Woodward on
first, Heckendorf has resumed his old
stand at third. The outfield has finally
settled down to Carver, Wayland, and
Parker, all of them dangerous men with
the bat.
Captain George Green has been catch
ing regularly in all of the games, and
lias added a world of power to the line
up. Ratner, who caught while Green's
leg was mending, is used as a pinch hit
ter, and has come through in this role
more than once.
Draper still remains the most depend
able pitcher on the squad, and as the sea
son advances his wing improves. His
twelve-inning game against Kenealy's
Seals was a good example of mid-season
form. Seay has been using Loewenstein
and Nef in the box during the vacation.
