THE KREMLIN, MOSCOW
JtCost of the famous buildings of the "world
are equipped with Out Elevators
The KREMLIN is the citadel of Moscow. The walla
of the triangular enclosure were built in the year that
Columbus discovered America. Much of the history ot
Russia—a dark tale of intrigue, mystery and bloodshed—
was enacted in the Kremlin buildings.
The present Great Palace dates back only to Napoleon's
day, for his soldiers burned the old palace. There are two
Otis Automatic Push Button Elevators in the Great Palace.
There is another Otis Elevator in the Nicholas Palace.
This is significant of the world-wide scope of Otis activi
ties. From the first crude hydraulic elevators to the mod
ern miracle of automatic vertical transportation, Otis has
led the way and even now is continually developing new
and better methods and machinery.
