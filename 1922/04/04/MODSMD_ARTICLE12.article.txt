# CARDINAL DIAMOND MEN TO CROSS BATS WITH PHOENIX NINE
## 
### 
The Cardinal baseball squad, traveling
to Oakland this afternoon, is playing its
last contest preparatory to the first game
of the series with California on Satur
day. St. Mary's is the team that Seay's
men go up against, and from past sea
sons' performances, the Saints are a hard
team to beat. They won from Califor
nia's horsehide sluggers about a week
ago, and have come out ahead on both
of their two trips to the Stanford campus
this year, by scores of 9-5 and 4 1.
I lowever, Seay's men have taken a
new lease on life within the past week,
and arc due to put up a hard tight today,
and especially on Saturday. Infield prac
tice on handling bunts was the work of
the varsity yesterday, and the develop
ment of all the batting eyes that can be
located is going on steadily.
The matter of pitching is not causing
Seay much trouble at present.- Twelve
runs off varsity pitchers irt the last four
games is a creditable record, and if the
hurlers are backed up properly by clean
fielding and timely hitting, the Blue and
Gold will not be the topheavy favorites
they now are among most of the follow
ers of the game.
Fifteen games have been played by the
varsity this season, and their opponents
have gathered a total of 53 runs off
Cardinal hurlers. This makes an aver
age of three and one-half runs per game,
which shows that Seay's pitching staff is
not in the habit of giving the rest of the
team a big lead to overcome.
