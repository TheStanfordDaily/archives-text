# Women Will Hold Tryouts For Pantomine Leads and 'Walking Parts' in Pageant
## 
### 
Pantomine tryouts for leading parts
in the cast of the women's pageant
both for roles requiring dancing as
well as those which call for pantomine
work alone, will be held in the As
sembly Hall, tomorrow afternoon, at
4 o'clock. At this time women who
wish to be in the "walking parts," or
ensemble numbers which do not in
volve dancing, may tryout.
Dancing tryouts for leads and
choruses were held this afternoon at
Roble Gymnasium and those women
who qualified for solo dances will be
notified to report for pantomine try
outs tomorrow. The cast is large and
there are opportunities both for indi
vidual dancing as well as for leading
pantomine roles alone. The entire
action of the masque is in pantomine
and no spoken words are used.
There are also a number of scenes
which require many women who do
not dance but in "walking parts" con
tribute to the effect as villagers and
attendants. These roles do not re
quire much rehearsing and it is ex
pected that a large number of women
will report for these parts.
