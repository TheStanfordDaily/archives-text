# VARSITY NINE TO PLAY SERIES OF GAMES IN HAWAII
## Cardinal Batsmen Will Meet Honolulu Baseball League Teams on Six Weeks' Trip 
### 
The varsity baseball team will leave
San Francisco for Honolulu June 21 to
play a series of games with the different
teams of the Honolulu Baseball League
and with other island teams. A group
of fourteen men will be picked fur the
trip, which will be under the supervision
of Ford Tussing, baseball manager. The
team will spend the month of July at the
islands, and will leave for home on Au
gust 5.
The board of directors of the Hono
lulu Baseball League has agreed to sus
pend its regular schedule of league games
during the time the Stanford team will
visit there and to play any or all of its
teams in a series of six or more games
against the varsity. In addition, games
will be arranged with any other teams
outside the league.
The games against the Honolulu Base
ball League are to be played on the first
six Saturdays and Sundays following
the team's arrival in Hawaii. This league
is comprised of six teams: the Asahj (all
Japanese), the Allround Chinese Ath
letic Club (all 1()0 per cent Chinese de
scent), the All Chinese team, the Braves
Athletic Club (mixed Portuguese and
Hawaiian), the Wanderers Athletic Club
(all white players), and the Waikiki
Athletic Club of mixed nationalities. The
first five of these teams are ranked very
high and are expected to give the var
sity a hard tussle. The Waikiki team is
a somewhat uncertain quality as live of
its last year's best players have trans
ferred to other teams, but a team is
again being rapidly organized. Second
games may be arranged between the
Cards and such of the league teams as
make the best showing in the first game.
It is also hoped to make arrangements
for the Cardinal batsmen to meet rep
resentative teams of the Army and Navy
stationed there, and also to meet the win
ning team of the Honolulu Commercial
Baseball League, a league composed of
teams representing some of the island
business concerns. This league will com
plete its schedule early in May, but the
winning team can be held together as the
majority of Commercial League players
also play in the Honolulu League.
If time and finances will permit, ar
rangements will probably be made for
the team to visit the Island of Hawaii
to play a game against a selected group
of players of the Hilo League and also
give the Stanford men a chance to visit
the Volcano of Kilauea.
The team will leave San Francisco on
the "Manoa" of the Matson Navigation
Co. line and will return on the "Lur
line" of the same line. Hotel accommo
dations have also been arranged in the
islands.

the team's arrival in Hawaii. This league
is comprised of six teams: the Asahj (all
Japanese), the Allround Chinese Ath
letic Club (all 1()0 per cent Chinese de
scent), the All Chinese team, the Braves
Athletic Club (mixed Portuguese and
Hawaiian), the Wanderers Athletic Club
(all white players), and the Waikiki
Athletic Club of mixed nationalities. The
first five of these teams are ranked very
high and are expected to give the var
sity a hard tussle. The Waikiki team is
a somewhat uncertain quality as live of
its last year's best players have trans
ferred to other teams, but a team is
again being rapidly organized. Second
games may be arranged between the
Cards and such of the league teams as
make the best showing in the first game.
It is also hoped to make arrangements
for the Cardinal batsmen to meet rep
resentative teams of the Army and Navy
stationed there, and also to meet the win
ning team of the Honolulu Commercial
Baseball League, a league composed of
teams representing some of the island
business concerns. This league will com
plete its schedule early in May, but the
winning team can be held together as the
majority of Commercial League players
also play in the Honolulu League.
If time and finances will permit, ar
rangements will probably be made for
the team to visit the Island of Hawaii
to play a game against a selected group
of players of the Hilo League and also
give the Stanford men a chance to visit
the Volcano of Kilauea.
The team will leave San Francisco on
the "Manoa" of the Matson Navigation
Co. line and will return on the "Lur
line" of the same line. Hotel accommo
dations have also been arranged in the
islands.
The varsity baseball team will leave
San Francisco for Honolulu June 21 to
play a series of games with the different
teams of the Honolulu Baseball League
and with other island teams. A group
of fourteen men will be picked fur the
trip, which will be under the supervision
of Ford Tussing, baseball manager. The
team will spend the month of July at the
islands, and will leave for home on Au
gust 5.
The board of directors of the Hono
lulu Baseball League has agreed to sus
pend its regular schedule of league games
during the time the Stanford team will
visit there and to play any or all of its
teams in a series of six or more games
against the varsity. In addition, games
will be arranged with any other teams
outside the league.
The games against the Honolulu Base
ball League are to be played on the first
