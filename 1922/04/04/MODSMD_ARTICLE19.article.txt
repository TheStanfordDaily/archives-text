# ALL-SOUTHERN TRACK
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the varsity track team meets
the combined star aggregations from most of the
colleges of the southern part of the state. The in
vaders have a good lineup and will make some
pretty races for places. Among their number are
some men who made places at the last Olympics.
Last year when the southern composite team was
north they left here for the most part with spoken
expression of the good time that they had had while
on the campus. As far as the athletic department
is concerned they will be treated courteously and
will have everything that the department has to
offer.
Away from the track and field these men are for
the most part in our organization groups. More
than mere lodging we can give them. Make it a
jx)int to go out of the way to see that they get ac
quainted with what we have around here and that
they miss nothing during their stay.
