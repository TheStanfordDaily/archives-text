# FRESHMAN CHANGES ON TRACK LOOK BRIGHT
## 
### 
California freshman track talent will
assemble on the campus Saturday at
1 :oO for the yearlings' "Big Meet" with
the Stanford babes. The Berkeley Cubs
have a large number of aspirants, and
will probably bring about forty men to
the Stanford oval. While "Dink's"
squad will consist of little more than half
of this, records to date show that the
Card runners are averaging about as
good as the U. C. stars.
California's most dangerous men are
in the sprints, while Stanford's strength
lies in the distance events. In a meet
with combined teams of six San Fran
cisco high schools Saturday, Redmond of
U. C. took first in the hundred with 10:1,
followed by Ryan, who later took the
220-yard event with 22:3 seconds. The
Cardinal's strongest contender in these
events is Howard. In the quarter mile,
Shermund, Stanford freshman, who has
been going around in :51, is counted on
for first, with Dole probably placing,
(ioertz, Aggler, and Juch have been
cleaning up for the Cubs, but have not
run under :52. With Holland and Daly
in the half, and Smith and Charles in
the mile, the Card yearlings are assured
of placing. California's time in the mile
last Saturday was 4:54, while Smith of
Stanford has made a mark of 4:54.
California will have the edge in the
pole vault, with Garner making 11 feet
.5 inches. The Cubs will also have an
advantage in the shot put and discus,
going a good six feet over the nearest
Stanford marks, but will meet strong
competition from Harlow and Cuddc
back in the javelin throw. Harlow has
thrown the spear 158 feet in practice.
No definite squad has been chosen for
the contest by Coach Templeton, but
about twenty-five men arc turning out
for final preparatory work this week.
