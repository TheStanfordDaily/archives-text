Skull and Snakes is throwing a dance on Saturday
night in the Basketball Pavilion. The aim of the
society is to make it one of the good old jolly-up
variety, such as was the delight of the Stanford
man and waiden in the good times when Menlo was
more than a watering station on the highway.
Since the war and its attendant breaking up of
things in general those good old days haven't been
very near to us and we haven't had the chance to
get together, such as was the custom when the case
hardened rough took his chances on the polished
maple with the terpsichating fairy from the five
hundred. Many theories have been advanced to
solve the problem why this state is "as is," but none
have really gotten out and tried to bring back the
jolly old times of the grab and get 'em struggle.
We make a lot of holler at the snakes who crawl
consistently at the bi-weekly revels in the near-by
metropolis, but most of us would be lost indeed if
we did not have them to perform before our en
chanted eyes while we stand without and inwardly
realize that perhaps we are holding the sack in not
being within.
Saturday night we have our chance. Skull and
Snakes is not the host. It is merely the manager.
The dance will be as much as we make it. If we
all go, single or double, we will all have a good
time. There is no bar on partnerships for the
evening, in fact they are encouraged, the main
thing being for all to come and enjoy themselves.
This is strictly an all-university affair and merits
our support the same as any other athletic struggle.
