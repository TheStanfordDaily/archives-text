# BASEBALL AT HONOLULU
## 
### 
It seems that the much-heralded trip of the Stan
ford nine to the Hawaiian Islands is to be a thing of
reality. Arrangements hkve been made at last
whereby the team will leave after the present quar
ter and make an extended trip in the islands playing
the teams that are made up from the various clubs
in the islands.
For several years there has been talk of a team
going to the islands, but the dream has never beeft
anything more than a dream, and so it has been.
This spring Bill Fletcher received an invitation for
the Stanford nine from a member of one of the
athletic clubs in Honolulu and negotiations have
been completed in the meantime.
California's ball team made a tour of the Orient
and established the good name of the state institu
tion there. We have a large and loyal alumni body

in Honolulu which will be behind the team all the
time that it is in the islands and the men ought to
have a fine trip as well as taking the name of Stan
ford sports down into the southern archipelago.
