THE ROUND-UP
(Appologies to Service)
JL'ooped up in a chair,
With my hands in my hair,
I think of the days gone by.
Of that hard old life.
And the days of strife,
It almost makes me cry.
With a whoop and a yell,
From the old corral,
I hear the round-up start.
I hear a shrill * .|7T '
From old Wild Bill,
That almost breaks my heart.
The cowboys ar dancing,
The horses are prancing,
The mess wagon's starting to roll.
It'll be quite a battle
To gather the cattle,
And some of boys'll pay toll.
I thing of the day
When I dew pay.
And rode on the rodeo,
Tho I sit in the house,
As still as a mouse,
I surely want to go.
When the boys hit town
They'll all go down
And have drinks at "Dan's Last Chance."
And long before night
They'll all be tight,
And there'll be a hell of a dance.
But they must be gone
At the break of dawn,
And ride out over the plains.
They'll be a sick-looking crew,
But they've got 'er to do,
No matter how much the head pains.
But here, come to!
I've Mechanics to do,
Or they'llkick me out of Cornell.
But I think of the boys
An Wyoming joys,
This studying for the untamed is swell (?)
—POWDER RIVER, in the Cornell "Sun.'"

His cheeks were thin;
His face was pale;
He might have been
Just out of jail.
I asked perchance
If he were broke;
With tragic glance
He thusly spoke:
I know I look
Quite like a wreck
But you're mistook;
I'm still on deck.
I've just been through—
Ah—woe is mine! —
That regist
ration Line!"
And this was all
That I could get;
He dropped axhausted.
Dead? You bet!
