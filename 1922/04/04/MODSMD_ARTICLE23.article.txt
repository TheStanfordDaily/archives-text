# APPRECIATED EFFICIENCY
## 
### 
The speedy way that students were taken care of
in the lines before the many windows of the "busy
ofiiee" yesterday may be credited to the interest of
the registrar's office in making the matter of regis
tration as easy as possible. With the ever-growing
student body there has been more and more of a
crowd in the office during the registration period.
Yesterday at an early hour all the lines in front of
the windows where the books' are given out had
dwindled and at no time was there a long wait
when compared with what there has been in the
past quarters. The shifting of the lower division
to a separate place is excellent, as it takes them
completely awav from the upperclass lines and
avoids a large number of mix-ups.
