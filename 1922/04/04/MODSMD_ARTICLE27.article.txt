from Los Angeles, after a tour of ten
•days.
The band left on March 25, making
the trip by auto bus. They reached Los
Angeles on Sunday, but did not com
mence their series of concerts until Mon

ceded to be Los Angeles' finest "movie
palace," was the location of the band
concerts. The band played four times a
day—twice every afternoon and twice
every evening. Leaving after the Sun
day night concerts, the Stanford mu
sicians made the return trip in one day.
From the interest that was shown by
the Los Angeles people, the trip of the
band evidently succeeded in awakening
enthusiasm. A ' huge banner strung
across Broadway bid "Welcome to Los
Angeles, Stanford Band!" and the news
paper advertisements and clippings fea
tured the visit of the Cardinal continfent.
This is the first long trip the band has
taken for over four years, and although
nothing definite about a return engage
