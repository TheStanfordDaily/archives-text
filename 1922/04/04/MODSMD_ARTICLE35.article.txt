Tom Carskadon, '22, and Warren F,
Lewis, '22, were the Stanford repre
sentatives of the Hammer and Coffin So
ciety which met at Oregon Agricultural
College for the purpose of establishing a
chapter there, which will publish the
Orange Owl. The society now consists
of four chapters, namely: the Stanford
Chaparral, the Washington Sun-Dodger,
Oregon Lemon Punch, and the Orange
Owl. The organization was founded in
1906 at Stanford and plans further na
tional expansion. Editors and managers
of the other Hammer and Coffin chap
ters were also present at the meeting.
Following the installation of the chap
ter a convention was held at which
Frank Lockery, editor of the Sun-
Dodger, was elected president of the so
ciety.
