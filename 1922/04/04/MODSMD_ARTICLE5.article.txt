Twenty-one hundred and seventy
eight students registered yesterday, the
first day of the spring quarter, according
to figures announced today by Dr. O. L.
Elliott, university registrar. The num
ber exceeds by 160 the number of stu
dents who registered the first day of the
spring quarter last year.
Eighty-seven new students were en
rolled. Twenty-four are women students
and the sixty-three are men. On the
first day of the spring quarter last year
eighty-nine new students entered.
The total final registration for the
spring quartr last year was 2333. Dr.
Elliott expects the total registration this
quarter to exceed that number. Besides
the usual number of students registering
late, the members of the Glee Club and
the Stanford Hand have not yet returned
from their spring vacation trips, and
they will not register until Wednesday.
However, it is not expected that the to
tal number of students who will register
this quarter will equal the past quarter's
enrollment, which was 2619. The en
rollment for spring quarters i* invariably
lighter than for winter quarters, accord
ing to Dr. Klliott.
