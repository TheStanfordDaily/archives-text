## 
### 
"Some Aspects of the Washington
Conference" is the subject of the lec
ture which Professor Lamato lehi
hashi will give In the Little Theatre,
at 7:30 this evening.
Dr. Ichihashi attended the recent
armament conference as a member of
the Japanese delegation. He also act
ed as an interpreter for Baron Kato
from Japan. On account of his posi
tion with the delegation, Dr. Ichihashi
was able to see the inside workings
of the conference and to attend all of
its sessions. In his address this even
ing, he will deal for the most part
with the machinery of the conference
rather than with the causes for it or
the effects which it has produced.
For eight years Dr. Ichihashi has
been a member of the Stanford faculty.
He is a professor of history and gives
courses in Japanese History and insti
tutions. He took his bachelor of arts
degree at Stanford. Later, in 1914, he
obtained the degree of Doctor of Phi
losophy in Economics and History at
Harvard.
This is the first of the Tuesday
lecture series for the spring quarter.
The Committee on Public Exercises
has already a partial list of the enter
tainments which will be given on
Tuesday evenings for the remainder
of the year. W. A. Craige of Oxford
University will speak on the Oxford
Dictionary next Tuesday. Whiting
Williams, whose articles in recent
numbers of Scribners' have called
forth much amusement, will talk on
"The Economic Reconstruction of
Europe." The date for his appearance
has not been been set. Among the
others who will speak are Irving Bab
bitt, professor of French literature of
Harvard, and W. W. Ellsworth of the
company.
