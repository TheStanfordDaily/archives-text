# Card Track Squad Hopes To Run Up Large Score Against Men From South
## Hartranft, Hanner Set New Marks In Preparation For Meet With Conference Stars Tomorrow 
### 
Anxious to retrieve their somewhat damaged reputations, twenty-five
tracksters, the pick of the Southern California Conference, arrived on the
campus yesterday ready to combat Templeton's Cardinal cinder forces, to
morrow afternoon, at 3 o'clock, on the local oval.
Nothing less than a score of one hundred points will satisfy the most
enthusiastic of the Stanford followers, in view of California's big victory;
the more conservative fans place the Stanford total around eighty-five. If
the southerners are half as good as their advance notices, they will score in
the neighborhood of forty points.
Cardinal hopes for a victory over the Bruins, somewhat dampened by the
showing against U. S. C., were heightened yesterday by the registration of

Morris Kirksey, the Cardinal tiyer
who is second only to Paddock in the
sprints. Neither Elliott, miler, nor
Kirksey will run against the southern
stars. All of the varsity squad es
caped the faculty axe.
Prior to the arrival of the invading
delegation, "Tiny" Hartranft and Cap
tain Hanner demonstrated that they
are without equal in America in their
respectice events. Hartranft started
by pushing the shot out 50 feet 2
inches, farther than he had ever done
before. Then Hanner hurled the
javelin" 206 feet, with several throws
over the 190 mark. There was a slight
wind at the time of the big heave. Not
to be outdone, Hartranft walked over
to the discus ring, and after a few
preliminary throws, tossed the platter
151 feet 2 inches.
The duel between Williamson and
Payne and Powers of the visitors in
the 440 occupies the leading position
on tomorrow afternoon's bill. But in
addition to this race, several close
finishes are slated by the "dope."
Falk and Allen hook up in the hurdles,
with the odds all in favor of the Car
dinal barrier topper. Argue, with 10
fiat to his credit in the century, will
oppose Hartranft and Sudden in the
sprints.
The SBO should be a pretty race to
watch, with Stroud, conqueror of the
Bruin half-milers, favored to win, al
though Macintosh and Daly should be
close behind him.
Unless the invading squad has im
proved considerably since its appear
ance last Saturday, Stanford should
take nearly as many first places as
did the Bears, but the Cards are
weaker in the second and third places.
Students will be admitted upon pre
sentation of their A. S. S. U. cards,
while the general public will be
charged 50 cents.
