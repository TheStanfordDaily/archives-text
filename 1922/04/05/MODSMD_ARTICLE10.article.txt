# EX-COMMITTEE TO GRANT AWARDS TO LIGHTWEIGHT MEN
## Part of Carnival Receipts to Go for Stanford Banner to be Used on Big Game Day 
### 
Block circle "S" sweaters will be
awarded in the future to members of
lightweight teams which make credit
able showings in a sufficient number of
games. This was the decision reached
last night at the first weekly meeting of
the Executive Committee for this quar
ter. Awards will probably be issued next
week to basketball men of the 130-pound
squad which has made such phenomenal
showings during the past two seasons.
Authorization was made by the com
mittee for the purchase of a large Stan
ford banner for use in the Stadium on
Rig Game Day, money for which will be
taken from the receipts of the Spring
Carnival. The money necessary for
sending Stanford athletes back to the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet next spring will
also be derived from this source. All
excess will be devoted to furthering the
advancement of the Daily Palo Alto
and the Glee Club.
A national campaign initiated by Co
lumbia University with Dr. Nicholas
Murray Butler at its head, has been
started in which $800,000 lias been set as
the goal necessary for the restoration
of the library at the University of Lou
vain, which was destroyed by the Ger
mans in 1914. This sum is to be raised
exclusively by American colleges and
universities, and those colleges which
contribute will be presented with a
shield. A quota of one dollar per head
has been advised by the committee in
charge of the campaign. Whether Stan
ford will participate in the project will
be decided after an investigation which
will be made by a committee appointed
by President Dan Evans, '20.
On the recommendation of Mrs. Eliza
beth Snell. appointment secretary, a plan

student workers as circumstances arise.

were appointed to confer with Mrs.
Snell.
The committee also voted that hence
forth it will be necessary for all organi
zations holding dances or other enter
tainments in the Stanford Women's
Clubhouse, to enter into a eontrqct in
which all damages incurred during the
evening either by roughs or by partici
pant members will be shouldered by the
organization.

eral classes showed all budgets to be

to meet.
