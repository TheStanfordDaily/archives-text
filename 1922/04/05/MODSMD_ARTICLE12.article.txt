# SIXTY MEN ENROLLED FOR SPRING GRID PRACTICE
## 
### 
Sixty candidates appeared at the
second day of spring football practice
in the Stadium, and there are yet men
who have failed to enroll under Coach
Warner, because of being occupied
with other spring activities.
"I am highly pleased with the pres
ent turn-out," Warner said, "but I
would like to see more heavy men
turn out for instruction. It does not
make any difference if they have had
football training before or not; we
aim to give them that. We are start
ing with the simplest rudiments of
the gameâ€”tackling, running, and so
on, and we are going to make no
distinction between the men in the
lines of ability. Everyone will get the
same treatment.
"We are handicapped to some ex
tent by the bigness of the squad, but
we aim to give as much individual in
struction as we can.
"With what varsity material there
is left from last year, plus the new
material that has already come out for
practice, there is a good chance of
turning out a strong team.
"Let me emphasize these two tilings :
the men who are already out should I
keep at it and not get discouraged
when the season is half over; and .
second, we want more large men out." I

Students will be given their first of
ficial introduction to Stanford's new
coaches, on Thursday evening, in the
Basketball Favilion, at the Spring
sport rally.
Two tackling dummies were erected
yesterday, and work was begun on the
best way of taking them from their
hooks. Later, the candidates prac
ticed on different members of the
squad. Standing tackles only were
tised, as it is too early to endanger
the men in running tackling.
The correct form of taking off for
a "tackle-around" run, and other of
the minor details that go toward mak
ing a fast, efficient team, were ex
plained.
A new charging sled will be ready
for the men on Thursday. It has
several features that are an improve
ment over the One now in use.
Practice will be suspended this aft
ernoon in order to give the men a
chance to see the track meet.
Work will continue in the Stadium,
as it provides a means of the keeping
spectators off the field, and yet gives
them a place from which to see the
practice.
Captain "Dud" DeGroot will not be
on the campus until the latter part
of the week, because of business that
is holding him in Los Angeles.
