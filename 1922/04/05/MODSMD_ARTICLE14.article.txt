the freshmen nine staged a rally which

School yesterday afternoon. The final
score was 10-7.
The babes meet Mission High School

the last game before the battle with the
Blue and Gold freshmen Saturday morn

Milton Teague, who took the mound
for the freshmen after the high school
lads had found Aydelotte for four hits
and five runs in the second inning, was
largely responsible for the babe victory.
In addition to allowing the liard hitting
high school players but three hits and
two runs in seven innings, he came to
bat in the last of the ninth with two
down and the bases loaded and connected
with one of Kleghorne's fast ones for a
home run.
San Jose started after Aydelotte in
the second inning and sent him to the
showers under a barrage of hits and
runs. When Teague finally stepped in
and stopped the rally, the freshmen were
on the short end of a 5-0 score. In the
fourth, however, two doubles and a sin
gle and a couple of errors on the part
of the high school third baseman enabled
the freshmen to tie the score. The
high school players counted again in the
fifth and seventh while they held the
freshmen scoreless.
Johnston opened the last of the ninth
by flying out. Dick Lavvson' was safe on
an error. McCandlcss, who was the
heavy hitter of the day, got his third hit.
a clean single, Lawson going to second.
The bags were filled when the high
school second baseman muffed Jim Law
son's grounder. Hoffman fanned. Fol
lansbee, batting for McDonald, hit an
easy fly which the second baseman
dropped, and Dick Lawson scored. With
two outs, the score 7-6 in favor of San
Jose, and the bases full, Teague hit one
down the third base line for a home run,
sending three men in ahead of him.
Coach Kallam's team is in the best
shape at the present time that it has
known this season. In Roberts, John
ston, Dick Lawson, Jim Lawson, and
McCandless, the babos have a formidable
array of hitters. All of these men are
hitting the ball at a .300 clip. The fresh
men are far from weak on the defensive.
With Johnston or McDonald at first,
"Shorty" Roberts at second, Cuddeback
or Johnston at third, and Mulkey a<
short, there is little left to be desired
in the infield. The outfield has five -good
men in Dick Lawson, Hoffman, Mc-
Candless, Connor, and Brown. Teague,
Aydelotte, and Solomon complete a trio
of pitchers which causes no end of
trouble for opposing batters. Jim Law
son and Johnston behind the bat round
out a club which will undoubtedly cause
Doles Rosenthal's Bruin cubs a great
deal of worry here Saturday.

hitting the ball at a .300 clip. The fresh
men are far from weak on the defensive.
With Johnston or McDonald at first,
"Shorty" Roberts at second, Cuddeback
or Johnston at third, and Mulkey a<
short, there is little left to be desired
in the infield. The outfield has five -good
men in Dick Lawson, Hoffman, Mc-
Candless, Connor, and Brown. Teague,
Aydelotte, and Solomon complete a trio
of pitchers which causes no end of
trouble for opposing batters. Jim Law
son and Johnston behind the bat round
out a club which will undoubtedly cause
Doles Rosenthal's Bruin cubs a great
deal of worry here Saturday.

for the freshmen after the high school
lads had found Aydelotte for four hits
and five runs in the second inning, was

high school players but three hits and
two runs in seven innings, he came to
bat in the last of the ninth with two
down and the bases loaded and connected
with one of Kleghorne's fast ones for a
home run.
San Jose started after Aydelotte in
the second inning and sent him to the
showers under a barrage of hits and
runs. When Teague finally stepped in
and stopped the rally, the freshmen were
on the short end of a 5-0 score. In the
fourth, however, two doubles and a sin
gle and a couple of errors on the part
of the high school third baseman enabled
the freshmen to tie the score. The
high school players counted again in the
fifth and seventh while they held the
freshmen scoreless.
Johnston opened the last of the ninth
by flying out. Dick Lavvson' was safe on
an error. McCandlcss, who was the

Jose, and the bases full, Teague hit one
down the third base line for a home run,
sending three men in ahead of him.
