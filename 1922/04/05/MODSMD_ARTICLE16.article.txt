# Registration Reaches 2190 On Second Day
## 
### 
A total of twenty-one hundred and
ninety students registered during the
first two days of the spring quarter, ac
cording to the figures given out today
by the registrar's office. Registration for
the similar period last year was 2125.
Fifty students, especially Federal Board
students, have deferred registering for a
few days, and these, together with other
students who have yet to enroll, will
probably bring the final figures for the
week to 2350, in the opinion of Dr. O. L
Elliott, registrar.
