# CALIFORNIA'S HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
Students at the University of Califronia adopted
the honor system of government, Monday, by a
vote of about ten per cent of the registered number
attending the university. There they face the same
lack of interest that characterizes student govern
ment in so many of the larger institutions and tends
to break down the management of the discipline by
the students. A few leaders are interested in the
movement because they see the good that can come
by making each student a part of a governmental
institution and making him feel that it is his duty
to uphold the institution in order that it may func
tion.
But the ordinary student in a college, unless he is
intimately associated with some part of the univer
sity life, does not take an active interest in the
governing life of the student body. He is interested
in athletic contests and feels a patriotic spirit about
his football team or track squad, and is willing to
stand up and argue about the relative merits of the
standing of his university. As far as the adminis
tration of his affairs goes, he leaves such to the
""politicians," in most cases, because he does not
care enough about his student government to take
a hand in it. He really never thinks of it, until
some article appears in the paper about some action
of a student body board that is of particular interest
to him.
This interest in the administration of student
government is what you must have to make the
scheme a success. In Wharton School, where the
honor system broke down and was abolished by
faculty and student action, the fault was traced
directly to lack of interest by students and their
resulting failure to report violations that were too
evident to be overlooked.
In the San Francisco Chronicle of today appears
a story on the California honor system, containing
an editorial from the Daily Californian on the sub
ject. The matter of "stool pigeoning" is featured.
Now the popular conception of a stool pigeon is a
member of the morals squad, in clothes to suit the
part, snooping around in the vicinity of the favorite
l)ootlegger or poker joint to get the goods, and
hand us over to the law. This idea is played up in
the Californian and it is illustrated clearly that there
is no use for the person who goes around telling on
his neighbor for the efficient use of the honor
system.
I lowever, the editor contradicts himself when he
says, "No one is asked to do anything but see that
neither he nor any other student steals units from
our Alma Mater or does harm to her by personal
conduct." The fundamental proposition of the
whole honor system rests on the assumption of re
sponsibility by each member of the student body
for acts of his neighbor. Each of us takÂ£s on our
self the obligation to see to it that his neighbor does
not violate the system; simply acting conscientiously
yourself is nothing at all, for the honor system de
mands one hundred per cent or nothing.
