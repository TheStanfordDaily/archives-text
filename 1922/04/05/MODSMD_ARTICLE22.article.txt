The late trips of the University non-sport organ
izations to the south and to the city have brought
well-merited praise to Stanford aggregations. The
band, at its week concert tour in Los Angeles,
where it was featured at Grauman's Theater, was
appreciated by a large number of people who are
not of the class that attend athletic contests. These
people are just .as necessary to our strength as the
fans of the football and swimming team that we

send to other colleges and towns, and this class
helps out in singing our praises as much as the
younger generation which contemplates coming to
college.
Across the thoroughfare in front of Gramman's
Theater was a banner with three-foot letters. "Wel
come Stanford University Band." The concerts given
by the band did credit to any professional organiza
tion and made a name for us in that vicinity with a
laj*ge number of families who otherwise might not
have any real sight of Stanford men and the way
we do things here.
