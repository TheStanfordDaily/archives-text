# CHALK UP A WIN
## 
### 
Across the top of the Southern California Trojan
for March 30 there appeared a banner in type two
inches high, "Stanford Wins Majority of Fights."
Under this is the story of the boxing tournament
held at the pavilion at U. S. C. Particular attention
is paid in the article to the good sports that the
invaders showed themselves to be. This is the same
report that has come up from tile south about all
the teams that went down for the spring meets.
The Cardinals emerged from most of the meets
victorious. This was expected from the comparison
of the dope on the various institutions.
In some of the meets, such as the swim with the
Los Angeles Athletic Club, we got an awful beating.
But winning or losing, the same spirit of good clean
fight marked all the games and left the southern
hosts with a good impression of the kind of man who
is a student in the University. Perhdaps the most
forcible impression made prima facie was on the
high schools where the freshmen visited. The babe
nine made a pretty extended trip, down to San
Diego and back up through the San Joaquin Valley.
Most of the games were easy wins for the young
sters and they made many good friends for Stan
ford among the near graduates of the high schools
where the games were held. The spring vacation,
looking at it from a viewpoint of future returns,
seems to have been a good one—heartily in keeping
with our bright outlook for successful seasons to
come.
