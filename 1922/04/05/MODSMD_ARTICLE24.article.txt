"It's a tough break," said Hugo, the midnight moth,
as he rode around on the alarm key, "to be a nine o'clock
feller in an eight o'clock course."

Seems that freshmen were rated equal to professors
in an intelligence test recently sprung. Somebody's al
ways getting a crack at them —but really, that's carry
ing discipline a little too far.

Now Cabbages earnestly believes that that's all bunk.
Having always championed the under dogs, we herewith
present them with a chance to redeem themselves and
start like afresh. In announcing the following test, we
feel that it is only fair to state that it will not be a
steep one, and nobody will be graded over four per cent.

Those having alternate seats will onswer every other
question, while those in the middle will take the rest.
Everyone must keep strictly within the time limit,
which will be announced at the close of the hour.

1. Translate the following sentence; then tell what's
wrong with it: "Skaljord blathsnesser eaudelin whish
off skowk."
2. Name and describe the following objects without
looking them up: blue sox, brown sox, black sox, gray
sox, white sox, green sox, rool sox, etc.
3. How much does it take to sink a floating axle? Did
you ever take that much?
4. Do you chew gum? Drink? Smoke? Snore? Ride?
Walk? Park? —Why?
5. Underline the correct way of finishing this sentence:
"There will be no lecture today, because:
—I couldn't think of anything to say;
—There will be an examination instead;
—I have to play golf;
—I feel that you can learn more about this sub
ject at the library."
6. What are the correct answers to the ai,ove ques
tions? The incorrect ones? Are they?

Those wishing to get their grades immediately will
drop a stamped, self-addressed envelope at the nearest
mail box.

Since marble season is over, Cabbages suggests a re
vival of Hide and Seek. Could be played every morning
with the correctors—make him count to 1000 before
taking the roll. In seat card class, a spirited game of
Pussy Want a Corner would vary the monotony.

But seriously, one could put a great deal of joy into
the little hearts of the boys and girls in Econ, by having
an informal scrimmage for papers every Friday night
in the Pavilion. The professors would undoubtedly be
glad to climb up into the rafters and toss the exes
down for the dear children to scramble for. And it
would be so much more enjoyable than the present
scramble, where restraint has been known to curb the
soaring spirits of the youngsters, oftentimes spoiling
the party. The new system could be used as a prelimi
nary to athletic events, you know, like hot pennies used
to be.

Gent entering church (highbrow kind, where you hire
a pew): Beg pardon madam, you are occupying my pie.
Lady (feels just as bad about it): Sir, I was sowed to
this sheet.
