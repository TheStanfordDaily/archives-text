# INTRAMURAL NINES ORGANIZE LEAGUES FOR COMING SEASON
## 
### 
A busy season for campus sand-lotters
is promised by the spring schedule for
intramural baseball, which will soon be
drawn up. The entrants are divided
into five leagues of six teams each, and
each league will be assigned to a speci
fied diamond for the entire series.
The games will run seven innings, and
will be played on Monday, Tuesday,
and Thursday afternoons at
4:30, starting April 10. Teams may ar
range to play before the scheduled date,
but not after, except in case of a neces
sary postponement on account of
weather or the impossibility of securing
a field.
Members of scheduled teams may re
ceive physical training credits for base
ball practice, and a player starting out
on one team must continue on that team
throughout the season; members of the

The league championships will be de
termined on a percentage basis, and a
team forfeits the game by failing to ap
pear. In case neither team shows up,
both are credited with a loss in the
percentage column. At the close of the
season, a "world's series" will be played
off by the winners of the various leagues,
and an effort will lie made to bring the
intramural champions of the University
of California to the Farm to meet the
Stanford pennant-winners.

any roughness or retaliation'' will watch
the rest of that particular game from the
bench.
