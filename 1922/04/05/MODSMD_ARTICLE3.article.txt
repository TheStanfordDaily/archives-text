# 1923 Quad to Be Bound in Leather; Two-Prize Sales System Announced
## 
### 
For the first time in the history of
Stanford year-books, a completely
leather-bound Quad will appear on the
campus when the 1923 annual is com
pleted this year. This binding to be used
on the 1923 Quad marks the highest
grade of uniform binding ever reached
by a Stanford publication. Former Quads
have had cloth, fabricoid and imitation
leather as the standard binding.
This year's annual will be one of the
few year-books in the country bound in
leather. The leather is the most ex
pensive and of the highest grade that
can be used in bookbinding, being
known as No. 1 cowhide. Numerous
economies have made possible the use of
this type of cover without a correspond
ing raise in price.
A two-price scale will be used in the
sale of the '23 Quad. At advance sales
the purchase price will be $5.50 the same
as was charged for last year's fabricoid
bound Quad. Then at a date to be an
nounced later, the price will be raised
to $6, thus giving the early buyer a
chance to save mo ey. This price will
Â«>ill be $2.50 below the cost of the
nited leather-bound special edition of
st year's annual.
