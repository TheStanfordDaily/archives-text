# WORK OF MONTEREY AND CARMEL ARTISTS PLACED ON EXHIBIT
## 
### 
As fine examples of strength and
character, the present exhibits by the
Carrnel and Monterey artists in the
Stanford Art Gallery are rivals of
much of the eastern work. Mr. Lemos
believes this exhibition fto be one
of the best held in two years.
Among the most interesting paint
ings is the work of Jessie and Corneli
us Botke, two Hollanders who are now
residents of Carmel. Mr. Botke's ex
hibits are especially attractive from
the standpoint of color and decorative
design. "Cloud Drama" is the best
example of his interesting color
schemes. Jessie Arms Botke is famous
for her bird pictures, a particularly
difficult and a good piece of work is
"White Peacocks."
A good illustration of fine poetical
expression as well as technique is
"Early Mass, (jarmel Mission," by
Myron A. Oliver of Monterey. Oliver'.',
work is also distinctive for his use of
mass and line to bring a vivid im
pression rather than a strict adher
ence to form. Mr. Oliver is a former
student of Stanford University and is
now completing his training in Paris.
Some very splendid animal pictures
are exhibited by C. S. Price and show
clearly his understanding and love for
his subjects. Mr. Silva's work is al
ready well known on the coast and is
interesting because of his modem
skill which gives it a very naturalistic
touch. Frey G. Grey is also famous
as a master of technique and special
izes in depicting atmospheric condi
tions.
