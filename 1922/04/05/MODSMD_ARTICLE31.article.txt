# Rare Set of Papers Added To Hoover War Collection
## 
### 
A complete set of tlie "Gazette ties
Ardennes," a German newspaper printed
in the occupied part of northern France,
is one of the additions to the Hoover
War Collection at tlie library. The set
is very rare in this country and there
fore exceedingly valuable. Although
the ditors were tliree Frenchmen, it was
the official German newspaper in that
portion of the country. It is printed in
French, but every issue contains articles
for the sole purpose of influencing the
French to the side of the Germans.
Another set which was received at the
same time is that from Great Britain.
This paper was sent by the Germans to
the British and gives the economic sit
uation in Germany during the war. Both
of these sets have been used by the His
tory department and it is desirable that
students of Economics and Political
Science also should use them.
A new catalogue for the Hoover War
Collection was installed during vacation.
Herbert Hoover, '95, visited the library
while on the campus and was pleased
with the work which has been done.
