queen in existence to rule over a modern
Utopia.

liminary organization, divided the work
among fifteen or more departmental di
rectors, adopted a definite policy regard
ing expenditures, and is now ready to
send out announcements regarding con
cessions to all living groups. Besides
concessions already decided upon', which
will be assigned to organizations by
preference as far as possible, original
productions arranged by any group,
which carry out the motif of the Carni
val, will be welcomed. With the selec
tion of concessions, final assignment of
3ites will be made, and actual building
operations will start, thus allowing
plenty of time for completion before the
opening day.
