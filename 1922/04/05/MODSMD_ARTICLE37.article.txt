Stanford will be represented by two
men at the national spring-board fancy
diving championships in the Olympic
club tank, next Friday evening. A1
White and Don Snedden are the men
who will wear the Cardinal colors.
White went south with the swimming
team during vacation and the ease
with which he won his event in all
the meets causes many sports writers
to ctamp him as the future fancy
diving champion of the country.
Ernie Brandsten, Stanford swim
ming coach has gained a reputation
as a developer of diving champions,
being responsible for Clarence Pink
ston's brillian career. Snedden is an
other man who should show up well
in close competition. He is a good
all-around diver and won many points
fr.r Stanford in the Southern California
