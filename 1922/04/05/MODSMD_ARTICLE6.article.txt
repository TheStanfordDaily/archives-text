# SAINT MARY'S TEAM WINS FROM VARSITY
## Conquerors of California Nose Out "Card" Nine 5-3; Guy Draper Shows Good Form 
### 
St. Mary's won their third straight
game of the season from the Cardinal
nine yesterday afternoon in Oakland,
the score being 5-3. Three hits were all
the varsity could gather off the Saints'
hurlers, while Draper and Kelly allowed
only five bingles throughout the nine
innings.
Draper, who is due to start against
California Saturday, pitched a dazzling
five innings. He allowed but one hit,
struck out six men, and only one oppos
ing runner got as far as second base
while he was in the box. Seay took
Draper out at the end of the fifth to rest
him up for Saturday's contest, and Kelly
went in. Up to this time the varsity was
leading, 3-0, but in the last half of the
sixth the deluge came. Five runs were
scored by the Saints on two hits, and
three bases 011 balls.
This ended the scoring for the game.
The varsity's first run came in the sec
ond inning, on a single by Parker, a base
on balls, and an error. Two more came
in the sixth without the aid of a hit.
Seven Saint Mary's sluggers went out
by the strikeout route, and eight Car
dinal batters died the saiiie way.
Draper's pitching has< been the out
standing item of encouragement during
the past two weeks. Only one run has
been scored off him in the last seventeen
innings he has pitched. The St. Mary's
bat wielders whom he held to one hit
in five innings yesterday are the same
wrecking crew that pounded out a 4-2
victory over California a week ago. If
Draper goes Saturday like he has been
going, the heaviest hitter 011 the Cali
fornia team will find trouble in connect
ing for a safety.
From all indications the game will be
a pitchers' battle, unless the Blue and
Gold goes on a batting spree 011 the spur
of the moment. All the dope in the world
will be upset if Seay's men should knock
any California pitcher out of the box,
and while this is possible, it can not be
said to be probable. On the other hand,
California has the reputation of a heavy
hitting team, but against Draper that
reputation is likely to take a decided
slump.
