# TRYOUTS FOR JUNIOR OPERA TO BE HELD
## 
### 
Tryouts for parts in this year's
Junior Opera will begin on Monday.
Les Seib, who will direct the produc
tion, has announced that all students
are eligible except freshmen women.
Rosemary Drachman, '22, and Tom
Kleckner, '19, were selected last quar
ter to write the plot for the 1923
Junior Opera. Miss Drachman was co
author of the 1921 Opera, and wrote
the plot for the women's Spring Page
ant. She is a member of Masquers
Society, Theta Sigma Phi, and English
Club. Kleckner was author of a
skit for the Football Show last fall.
He belongs to Hammer and Coffin
Society, Press Club, and Sigma Delta
Chi.
This year's production will have a
combination of Miss Drachman's plot
with Kleckner's dialogue which were
written in competition. The authors
have been working for several weeks
on this plan and have practically com
pleted their task.
Although music and dancing are still
large features, more stress will be
laid on the plot than former operas.
Rescuing is the main theme of the
plot. There is a man who is always
so kindly intentioned as to try to
rescue people from difficult situations.
His fiancee starts in to cure him by
rescuing a few individuals herself.
A series of rescues and counter-res
cues involve her in such a tangle that
she has to be rescued by others.
