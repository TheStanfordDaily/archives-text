# "OPEN DIPLOMACY AT DISARMAMENT PARLEY IS FAKE"
## Professor Ichihashi Says Big Three Directed Conference After unrecorded Meetings 
### 
"The alleged open diplomacy of the
Washington Conference is pure fic
tion," said Professor Yamato Ichihashi
in his address on "Some Aspects of
the Washington Conference," last
evening in the Little Theatre. Pro
fessor Ichihashi was secretary of the
Japanese delegation and interpreter
for Baron Kato at the conference.
"The'first session of the meeting
was open to the general public. When
many other open session were held
it seemed as if there were a new era
in diplomacy and that there would be
no more secret treaties or interviews.
There was an atmosphere of inform
ality at .these open meetings. The
public in the galleries would respond
to one speech by calling out the name
of a foreign diplomat for a reply. The
foreign diplomat who was generally
not on the program for that day would
reply with a prepared speech. The
delegation from other nations were
quite at home in informal America.
"The public likes to see and hear
big men and the big men like to talk
before the public. There were many
international oratorial contests in
English, French and even Japanese,
which added to the popularity of the
Washington gallery. At these times
flie diplomats spoke freely within the
limits which were marked out for
them."
Professor Ichihashi then told of the
men who really ran the conference.
These were Hughes, Balfour and
Kato, the Big Three. They held
many meetings together, and many
other interviews when one of them
was absent. In this way they thrashed
out the questions which the confer
ence waÂ° to decide and came to the
agreements which seemed to be made
in oppn sessions of the conference.
"A hen Balfour, Hughes and Kato
had settled most of their problems the
Big Three was expanded to the Big
Five with representatives from France
and Italy added. Later this group was
enlarged to include .fifteen, and finally
it consisted of the full committee and
two naval experts.
"To most of the meetings of these
small groups the public and a large
part of the delegates were not ad
mitted. In order to encourage frank
discussions, no written record was
kept of their proceedings. These in
terviews were the most important part
of the Washington conference.
"Unlike tue international confer
ences in the past, the delegates made
a special effort to meet the representa
tives of the press, of whom there were
more than four hundred. Individual
interviews were impossible. Each
delegation maintained an office in
which they met the newspaper cor
respondents as often as possible. At
meetings of this sort the delegates
allowed themselves to be questioned
on any subject concerning the prog
ress of the conference. They did not
always answer the questions. How
ever, this put the correspondents into
close familiarity with the delegation
and the popularity of any of them was
due to the judgment of the members of
the press."
