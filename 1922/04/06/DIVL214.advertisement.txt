Yours for Service on
All Makes of Batteries
You can't expect your battery to go
on without service any more than
you can expect your tires to stand up
without air or your motor to work
without oil!
Battery service is our business. We have
the equipment, the skill and the "knowledge
that enables us to make your battery last
longer and serve better.
We always recommend Willard Threaded
Rubber Batteries, but don't get the idea
that you can't get the Willard Standard of
Service unless you have a Willard Battery.
We have only one grade of service here at
Battery Headquartersâ€”and everybody gets
it on the same basis whether he's a Willard
user or not.
