rieres why
the quality cigarette
BECAUSE we put the utmost quality into
this one brand. Camels are as good as it's
possible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge
of fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.
Nothing is too good for Camels. And bear
this in mind! Everything is done to make
Camels the best cigarette it's possible to buy.
Nothing is done simply for show.
Take the Camel package for instance. It's the
most perfect packing science can devise to pro
tect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy
paper—secure foil wrapping—revenue stamp
to seal the fold and make the package air-tight.
But there's nothing flashy about it. You'll find
no extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.
Such things do not improve the smoke any
more than premiums or coupons. And remember
—you must pay their extra cost or get lowered
quality.
If you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest
cigarette you can imagine—and one entirely free
from cigaretty aftertaste,
' It's Camels for you.
