# Professor Treat Tells of Jap-American Relations
## Peace of Pacific is Dependent upon Friendliness, Says Speaker 
### 
"The peace of the Pacific depends
upon the good will of the United
States and Japan, and the men and
women of the universities should be
willing to secure it," said Professor
Payson J. Treat, of the History depart
ment, before a student assembly this
morning.
Professor Treat was in close con
tact with the political and social lead
ers of Japan during a recent six
months visit in the Orient and has
returned more convinced than ever
that Americans should exert them
selves to live 011 friendly terms with
Japan. "The Japanese have a high
regard for the United States and wish
to win its good will and retain it,"he
said. "Every educated man in Japan
has a knowledge of America and many
of them have received their education
here."
"Japan is very eager for education,"
continued Professor Treat. "She has
one of the most adequate elementary
school systems which shows a ninety
nine per cent enrollment of the chil
dren. It is only the lack of funds
which has prevented the establishment
of more higher schools."
Professor Treat was especially im
pressed by the attentiveness of the
students at the universities at which
he lectured. His lectures were ar
ranged by the Japanese-American Re
lations Committee, a group of influ
ential Japanese who are interested in
building up a good understanding be
tween Japan and America and it was
upon their invitation that Professor
Treat made the trip to (he Orient.
Professor Treat gave his lectures in
English before student audiences of
from three to eight hundred. "It was
necessary to reorganize my material
somewhat, cutting out long sentences
and to speak more slowly," said Pro
fessor Treat.
"Stanford is well-known and ad
mired in Japan," continued Professor
Treat in speaking of the hospitality
of the presidents and faculties of the
universities which he visited. He also
spoke of the growing recognition of
the United States as an educational
center, especially for students of medi
cine.
"Japanese college students are very
much like our own," said Professor
Treat. "But they are more liberal in
political and economic thought and are
opposed to militarism. College men
there carry heavier programs than in
the United States, yet they find time
for sports and other activities." Base
ball is the national sportâ€”"The Amer
ican conquest of Manchuria," Profes
sor Treat phrased it, to a Japanese
professor while attending a college
game.
Opportunities for education in Japan
have now increased twenty-five per
cent, Professor Treat pointed out, and
this is an important fact for America
to remember that she is dealing with
an educated people. It was the re
port that educational budget must suf
fer to keep up with the armament
race which brought Japan to the reali
zation of armament costs. The invi
tation to the Washington Conference
was viewed with some uncertainty
and alarm said Professor Treat, who
arrived in Japan before the delega
tion left for this country. The out
come of the conference relieved the
tension and quieted the suspicion ex
cept among a few irreconcilables. "It
was the spirit of the conference which
meant so much to Japan," said Pro
fessor Treat. "The people felt after
it that they could count on the United
States to discuss problems of the Pa
cific, and not merely judge them."
"One of my most interesting experi
ences in Japan was a conference with
the Japanese-American Relations Com
mittee, when the members questioned
me on conditions in California. At
the end of the conference the commit
tee was convinced that Japanese im
migration should be restricted until
America is ready to welcome the
Japanese here, and that those Japanese
who have been lawfully admitted
should be given all the protection that
their treaties and constitution pro
vide." 1
