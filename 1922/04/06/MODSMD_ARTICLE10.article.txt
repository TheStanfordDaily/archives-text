# FRESHMEN PROSPECTS IN TRACK IMPROVED
## Thirty-three Entries Include Many New Runners Doped to Place in Meet Saturday 
### 
Thirty-three freshmen will enter the
Stanford-California yearling track meet
here Saturday. Entries posted by ;
"Dink" Templeton today show that the j
babes have an even better chance than |
was predicted to best the Berkeley squad.
Four new men of known ability have |
been*added to the Cardinal forces, be- |
sides a number who have entered this !
quarter from high school track squads.!
Righetti, who can toss the javelin over
170 feet, will compete for the 1925 atli- j
letes; Leistner. star hurdler of Palo
Alto High, will enter both stick events ;i
Thornton, who Iras hit 10 fiat in the lum- j
dred, will return, and Wheat, who made I
fast time in the Irish Marathon, is listed I
on the relay team, pole vault, broad jump
and high jump.
The babes' greatest power seems to be
on the track, with the javelin the only
one of the field events in which the fresh
men are sure of a place. With Thorn
ton, Shermund, and Howard in the
sprints, Shermund as a probable winner
of the 440, Smith running in the half,
mile, and two-mile, together will Charles
in the half and mile, and Holland in the
twb-mile, and Leistner entering both
hurdle events, the chances of a Stanford
victory lie chiefly in piling up points in
the cinder-burning events, in which U.
C.'s only dangerous men are found in
the hundred and quarter mile.

Thornton. Howard, Shermund, Tennant,
