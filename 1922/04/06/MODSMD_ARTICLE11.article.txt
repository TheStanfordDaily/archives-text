# GLENN WARNER TO SPEAK AT PAVILION RALLY TONIGHT
## 
### 
Coach "Pop" Warner and Assistant
Coach Claude Thornhill, will be wel
comed at the spring sports rally, which
is scheduled to start at 7:30 this
evening, in the basketball pavilion.
This will be the first opportunity that
the most of the Stanford student body
have had of hearing the new Cardinal
coaches.
Word was received here this after
noon that Coach E. P. Hunt, newly ap
pointed director of freshman athlet
ics, will be present at the spring rally
in the pavilion this evening. Coach
Hunt is to take charge of freshman
football next fall.
Coach Warner will be at Stanford
for about six weeks more, directing
spring football practice and will then
return to the East, where he is to
have charge of the University of Pitts
burgh team for the next two seasons.
This evening Warner will probably
make known his ideas concerning Stan
ford's future football policy and pros
pects as he has been able to ascertain
from the short period of practice.
Thornhill will be assistant coach next
fall and will work with Andy Kerr,
who is at present in the East, in the
development under Warner's super
vision of the Cardinal eleven. Thorn
hill was a member of the Centre Col
lege coaching staff and was one of
the big factors in developing the team
that startled the entire country with
its playing.
With the Stanford-California fresh
man track meet on next Saturday, and

the varsity meet two weeks later, i
Coach "Dink" Templeton will give
first-hand information on the prospects
for victory in these two meets. From
the early dope all sporting writers are
of the opinion that the Big Meet will
be one of the closest in the history of
competition between the Bears and
the Cardinals.
Yell Leader Bob Connolly and his
assistants Lou Minskv and Chet Doug
las are anxious to make the first pa
vilion rally one of the "peppiest" that
has ever been held. There will be
seats and space for everybody that
attends.
The first game of the three-game
series against the California baseball
nine comes off Saturday, and many of
the wise ones have predicted that a
surprise is apt to be pulled upon the
Bruin aggregation. Coach Duffy Seav
will also be heard at the rally and
may be made at this spring sports
issuing some new dope concerning
the Cardinal chances for victory.
The only restriction on the amount
of noise and the kind of noise that
may be made at this spring ports
rally is that no guns will be allowed
within the pavilion.
In past years the spring sports
rally has always been one of the big
events of this part of the year. Those
in charge wish it understood that
everyone is invited to attend, includ
ing people not connected with the stu
dent body.
