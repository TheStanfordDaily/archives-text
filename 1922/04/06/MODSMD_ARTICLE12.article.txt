# TEMPLETON'S SQUAD WINS TWELVE FIRSTS IN SOUTHERN MEET
## Technicality Deprives Hanner Of Coast Record; Williamson Runs Fast Quarter Mile 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
It was "visitor's day" at the Stanford oval yesterday, when Coach Temple
ton placed his band of Cardinal track and field athletes on exhibition before
a thousand or more spectators. Most important of the visitors were the
southern conference cinderpath stars, who despite a to 60'/, defat, more
or less justified the advance reports sent out by the press agent.
All but four of the sixteen first places—those in the 880, mile, two-mile,
and the relay—were captured by Cardinal representatives, who turned in
some good marks as the result of their afternoon's labor.
Also among those present were L. B. Mintow and J. H. Tomlinson, on
the Records Committee of the Pacific Association of the A. A. IJ., who came
down prepared to put their official sanction on one or more new records.
Captain Hanner did his best not to disappoint them, hurling the javelin 197
feet 1 inch, within 4/ inches of the American record. His throw bettered
the Pacific Coast mark, but the A. A. U. official refused to allow it because
the grip on the spear was one inch shorter than the rules specified.
Several members of the California track team were interested on-lookers.
"Oxy" Hendrixson, star 440 man of the Bears, saw "Blink" Williamson run a
sensational quarter mile in 50 seconds flat, beating Payne, of the southerners

by a good five yards. Later -in the
afternoon the watches caught William
son at 49 4-5 after he had made up
ten yards previously lost by fumbling
the baton and had come within inches
of overtaking Payne in the last lap
of the relay.
Hutchinson, Bruin sprinter, was
down to watch Eddie Sudden romp
away with the 100 in 10 flat, and re
peat in the furlong in 21 3-5 seconds.
Hartranlt failed to place in the cen
tury, Allen and Argue of the visitors,
captur'ng second and third.
Lane Falk, with "Muggs" Van Sant
of California looking on, had little dif
ficulty in beating Allen of Redlands in
the J2O yard high hurdles, in the fast
time of 15 3-5 seconds. The Cardinal
barrier-topper wound up the afternoon
by traveling the low's in 24 2-5 seconds,
with his team-mate, Hayes, close on
his heels.
Norris, who pole-vaulted for Cali
fornia, took a day off to see how hiw
rivals would fare at the hands of
Goodenough, the all-star vaulter, who
cleared 12 feet 6 inches in the meet at
Berkeley, Saturday. The best Good
enough could do here was to tie for
<hird, and the reliable Art Wilcox
took his first honors at 12 feet'. Hyde
of Redlands was the man in the pinch
foi the southerners, as he topped 12
feet on the jump-off, higher than ho
had ever gone before.
Hartranft had a quiet day, taking
first in the shot and discus with what
would be phenomenal marks if his
past performances were not taken into
consideration. Minsky surprised by
winning the broad jump, with a leap
of 22 feet.
