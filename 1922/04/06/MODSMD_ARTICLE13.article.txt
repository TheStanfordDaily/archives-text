# BASEBALL FIGHT RULES ISSUED BY SKULL AND SNAKES
## 
### 
Thursday, April 27, is the tentative
date for the annual sophomore-freshman
baseball fight. The last Monday of April
had been set aside for the brawl, but
Skull and Snakes, the organization in
charge of the light, thought Thursday
would be the proper day as all pre-tight
controversies would then be eliminated.
It remains now for the Executive Com
mittee, which convenes next Tuesday
night, \to pass on the date.
Detailed rules for the progress of the
fight have not as yet been formulated, as
Skull and Snakes is occupied at present
with the "Jolly-Up" which will be given
Saturday night. These rules will be is
sued the first part of next week. Gen
eral rules, however, have already been
passed upon by the honor society, for
the conduct of the fight, these follow:
1. Skull and Snakes society shall be in
charge and shall arrange the details of
the light.

either teams or classmen before the
