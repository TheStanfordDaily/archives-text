# BUILDING UP A SYSTEM
## 
### 
With the signing l of a contract between the Uni
versity and E. B. Hunt to come to Stanford next
year as director of freshman sports, we have added
another man to the machine being built up to
standardize our athletic system. Hunt has been
under consideration for some time and was agree
able to coming to Stanford. He has been phenom
inally successful in his work at Berkeley High
School, where he has built up a smooth working
plan of which has won him the close co
operation of the students and has made his teams
extremely successful.
When Hunt was under consideration for the
freshman coaching position here Warner gave his
unqualified endorsement of Hunt as the man to
â€¢whom he could most satisfactorily trust the fresh
man material to be trained along the line which
the varsity will receive. Hunt is thoroughly versed
in the Warner system of play and will make it
easy for the installation of the one brand of attack
in the game to be instilled in the players from the
time they first start to play football here.
With such a satisfactory addition to the staff we
may look forward to a very successful season in the
first-year sports.
