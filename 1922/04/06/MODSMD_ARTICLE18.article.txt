# THE 						SPRING RALLY
## 
### 
/ Tonight is the first time that many of us will
have had a chance to meet Glen Warner, the man
who is to shape our athletic program, as far as
football goes, for the next four years. lie will be
the main speaker of the evening. This year we
have many new things to celebrate at the rally that
we have been looking for for a long time. For the
first time it will be held in a hall where there will
be 110 crowd holding half the participants 011 the
outside and stifling those on the inside. The new
basketball pavilion will not be exactly dedicated to
noise tonight, but it will have its first workout for
a professional noise-containing hall.
1 Warner will tell the student body entire some
few things which he is going to do if we give him
our support in the next year. He talked to a small
body when here the last time, but will meet us all
donight. He is a man who has a power of convinc
ing you that you cannot overcome and attendance
at the rally will make a lot of things clear to us all
that we do not understand now.
The yell leaders have something new in the line
of stunts to work off and for the rooters to learn.
It is but little more than two weeks now to the track
meet and the babe struggle is this week. This will
be the only time we have to give them a good send
off before the meets. About 2,000 of us at the rally
will be a good representation. Let's give it about
an hour of our time* It's worth it every day.
