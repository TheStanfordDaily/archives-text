### 
V' Some rather odd outcomes marked the various
events at the meet yesterday afternoon with the
combined teams of the south. Men expected to
place first and second did not and others showed
surprising speed and fooled the dopesters. Ihe
best part of it was, though, that every contestant
was putting the best he had into his work. I his
is the thing, a lack of which robs many early meets
of interest.
Yesterday Ix'ing a warm one, without wind, the
bleachers were well filled. This is the encourage
ment that athletics needs. Ihe men cannot keep
going at their best if they do not have visible sup
port from the sidelines. We may wish them well

and all that, but it is our part to give them our
actual present support of attendance at the contests.
The meet was a good one from all standpointsâ€”for
the fans looking at the excellent marks being made,
for the runners seeing that the student body was
behind them and was pulling with them for a win.
