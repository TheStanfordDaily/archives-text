Cap and Gown will sell tags on Quad
all day Friday for the benelit of the
Women's Clubhouse, according to an
announcement by Dorothy Marston, '21,
president of the society. The tag sale
will take the place of the Cap and Gown
dance which is given annually to help
pay the debt on the clubhouse. Another
method used by Cap and Gown to aid
the clubhouse fund was to place a box
in the Stanford Bookstore for the profit

During the fall quarter, Cap and
Gown conducted a tag sale to raise
money for the varsity football training
table.
