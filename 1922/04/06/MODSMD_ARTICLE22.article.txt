THE STRIFE OF RILEY
Each day at six a. m. o'clock this husky lad dons
shoon and sock, and romps around but semi-dressed;
he breathes ten times, and slams his chest, and
swallows chunks of springtime air, and vaults around
the morris chair. Thus Thaddeus Horatius Jones puts
pep and vigor in his. bones, then comes to my sweet
trundle bed and shies an inkwell at my head; a simple
way of telling me he's going on a hiking spree, and that
I ought to go along to pass the day in festive song,
in swinging from the hawthorn bought, or playing tag
with pensive cows. I rise; my weary spirit groans on
looking at Horatius Jones, whose pants are baggy at
the knee from chasing skunks and climbing trees, who
carries hatchets by the peck and winds a knapsack
'round his neck. "My Gawd" and eke "My Gosh" I cry
and heave a deep and heavy sigh to tell him I would
sleep some more, and would |ie kindly shut the door.
Horatius, as I've said above, has Dempsey looking
like the dove that plays among the little tots and
browses on the chimney pots. He lift me like a pussy
cat and drapes a sweater o'er my slat, and leads me off
to Watkins Glen as though I were a bantam hen. The
next two weeks through nights and morn my feet are
filled with ingrown corns; I sadly hop about the Libe
a member of the sparrow tribe, and grinning yokels
say "By heck, the poor lad's seen a flivver wreck."
On dreary evenings when I go to bed, I sing my tale
of woe while winding some half dozen reels of bunion
plasters on my heels.
Just now I'm sitting in my room engrossed within a
book of Hume; a robin sits athwart the sill and fills
the air with chirp and trill. "What could be happier
than this?" I gaily cry, and dream of bliss; but then
my friend Horatius calls and yaps about Taughannoek
Falls. He drags me from my snug retreat to get new
blisters on my feet, and wear the toes from woolen
socks by wading streams and jumping rocks.
It seems reformers ought to rise and free us from
these healthy guys who want to make us sleep in barns
and dive for eels in muddy tarns. When I'm engaged
in scanning books, I've no desire for grassy nooks.
Though people stand around and say: "Good Lord,
but he's a simple jay," I want to get a raft of sleep,
and live my life so I can reap my own supply of
Heaven's manna, then die in peace; so help be Hannah

OVER THE DEEP BLUE SEA
(Apologies to Bonnie)
My Mother's a Phi Beta Kappa,
My. Father's a Tau Beta Pi.
But outside of the Kegs of I Tappa
Of what in thunder am I?
I bust all my examinations,
The professors know I'm the bunk.
In all of my recitations,
I can't grab a bit of the junk.
So I fear that I must leave college.
And start on the road to my home.
For I've found that I can't get knowledge
In my solid ivory dome.
So my future lies over the ocean,
Where liquor is good and cheap.
I'll be darned if I ain't got a notion
To try my luck across the deep.

Horatius, as I've said above, has Dempsey looking
like the dove that plays among the little tots and
browses on the chimney pots. He lift me like a pussy
cat and drapes a sweater o'er my slat, and leads me off

next two weeks through nights and morn my feet are
filled with ingrown corns; I sadly hop about the Libe
a member of the sparrow tribe, and grinning yokels
say "By heck, the poor lad's seen a flivver wreck."
On dreary evenings when I go to bed, I sing my tale
of woe while winding some half dozen reels of bunion
plasters on my heels.
Just now I'm sitting in my room engrossed within a
book of Hume; a robin sits athwart the sill and fills
the air with chirp and trill. "What could be happier
than this?" I gaily cry, and dream of bliss; but then
my friend Horatius calls and yaps about Taughannoek
Falls. He drags me from my snug retreat to get new
blisters on my feet, and wear the toes from woolen
socks by wading streams and jumping rocks.
It seems reformers ought to rise and free us from
these healthy guys who want to make us sleep in barns
and dive for eels in muddy tarns. When I'm engaged
in scanning books, I've no desire for grassy nooks.
Though people stand around and say: "Good Lord,
but he's a simple jay," I want to get a raft of sleep,
and live my life so I can reap my own supply of
Heaven's manna, then die in peace; so help be Hannah

OVER THE DEEP BLUE SEA
(Apologies to Bonnie)
My Mother's a Phi Beta Kappa,
My. Father's a Tau Beta Pi.
But outside of the Kegs of I Tappa
Of what in thunder am I?
I bust all my examinations,
The professors know I'm the bunk.
In all of my recitations,
I can't grab a bit of the junk.
So I fear that I must leave college.
And start on the road to my home.
For I've found that I can't get knowledge
In my solid ivory dome.
So my future lies over the ocean,
Where liquor is good and cheap.
I'll be darned if I ain't got a notion
To try my luck across the deep.

Each day at six a. m. o'clock this husky lad dons
shoon and sock, and romps around but semi-dressed;
he breathes ten times, and slams his chest, and
swallows chunks of springtime air, and vaults around
the morris chair. Thus Thaddeus Horatius Jones puts

I ought to go along to pass the day in festive song,
in swinging from the hawthorn bought, or playing tag
with pensive cows. I rise; my weary spirit groans on
