# FRESHMEN WIN FROM MISSION HIGH NINE BY SCORE OF 14-2
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman nine defeated
Mission High School by a score of 14-2
yesterday afternoon in the last prelim
inary game of the season. The babes
played a tight defensive game behind
airtight pitching by Follansbec, and made
most of their fourteen hits count for
runs. Follansbee allowed but two hits
and as many runs, striking out nine men.
Roberts was the heaviest hitter of the
game, getting two singles and a homer
in three trips to the plate.
George ("Shorty") Roberts was elect
ed captain of the freshman team after
the game last night. Roberts registers
from San Diego and is a graduate of
San Diego High School, where he
played ball for four years. He played
the outfield for two years, but since that
time has been a fixture at second base.
He is a clever defensive man and is hit
ting the ball at a terrific clip. The en
tire freshman infield is built around him.
Roberts is a member of Phi Delta Theta. "
With the first California game sched
uled for Saturday morning, light work
outs will be in order this afternoon and
tomorrow. Kallam had his infielders
and pitchers fielding hunts after the
game yesterday afternoon.
Kallam has not announced the line-up
for Saturday's game yet, but it is prob
able that the team will go on the field
with the same combination which has
played the last several games. Johnston
has been holding down the first base po
sition in a satisfactory manner and is
leading the team in hitting. Roberts at
second is playing bang-up ball and has
found his batting eye. Cuddeback will
undoubtedly take care of the difficult
corner, with Mulchey at short. In the
outfield, Dick Lawson, Hoffman, and
McCandless have first call on the po
sitions, with Brown and Connor to back
them up. Jim Lawson has been playing
great ball behind the bat and is getting
into old-time hitting form. It is hard
to pick the twirler for Saturday's game,
but the choice will probably lie between
Solomon and Teague.
