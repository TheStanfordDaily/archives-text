# CARD NINE IS READY FOR CRITICAL GAME
## 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
With the tirst of the three-game series
campus baseball fans are asking them
selves if the varsity's chances are as
poor as current rumor has had it, or
whether a last-minute revival has come
to the rescue to make possible a victory.
California has admittedly one of the
strongest nines in the history of the
state university. Their record this year
has shown them to be a team of heavy
hitters, with pitchers that are far from
lacking class.
Those who go about casting great
gobs of gloom over the landscape, and
who feel sure that Stanford has no more
chance than a 20-to-l shot at Tijuana,
are those who count heavily on compar
ative scores. If the comparative scores
so far this season determined absolutely
the outcome of the game Saturday, the
series might as well be called off. It
lias been proven, however, that in base
ball, as much as in any other sport, tech
nical "dope" actually works out about
once in several hundred years. This is
especially true when the weaker team
lias a pitching staff that is capable of
holding down the heaviest hitting team.
Early in the season, no one would take
a chance on predicting the future of
the Cardinal pitching staff. Draper,
however, has just recently reached his
mid-season form, and has been wreck
ing the batting averages of some of the
heaviest hitters in the locality. Cali
fornia's sluggers are apt to find that their
batting eyes were checked at Berkeley.
