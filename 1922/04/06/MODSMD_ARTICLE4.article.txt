## 
### 
Dr. Branner was a leader of men.
This was flie tribute which President
Wilbur paid to the late president emeri
tus at the opening of the student assem
bly this morning.
President Wilbur explained that the
university had, planned to have some
memorial exercises but abandoned them
in deference to Mrs. Branner's wishes.
For this reason he read an excerpt
from an address made by Dr. Branner
to Stanford student. 1908, 011 loyalty, as
typical of the life and service of the
writer. The excerpt lollows in part:
"Loyalty is an important factor in the
making of character, and even, if you
care to look at it in that light, an asset
in your profession, or in your business.
"When you get through your univer
sity studies and go out into the affairs
of life, if you become employers of other
men, you will lay great stress 011 the
loyalty of those you have about you.
You may not put it to yourselves in
just this form, but if you are wise, you
will none the less be influenced as much,
or even more, by loyalty of your em
ployees than by any other one quality
they may have. You will say of every
man you engage: 'If I can't trust this
man to think of and work for my in
terests, I don't want him around, no
matter how skillful lie may be in his
particular line of work.'
"Remember, too, that loyalty,* like
charity starts at home. Nowhere can
one see a finer sight than that of a
family that stands compactly together,
helping and encouraging each other
within, and defending each other from
without.
"And don't expect too much of any
body. We are all human, and human
frailties are in our blood and bones.
Whether the object of your loyalty be a
person, an organization, a party, or a
principle, you must not expect it to be
perfect. None of the relations of this
life are altogether satisfactory.
"Loyalty is one of the big and far
reaching virtues; it makes trustworthy
men and great men; as a national virtue
it makes a people great. For if it is love
that makes the world go round, it is
loyaltv that holds the world together."
