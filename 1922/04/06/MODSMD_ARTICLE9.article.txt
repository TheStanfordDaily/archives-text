# Established Order To Give Place To New On April 19
## 
### 
Wednesday night, April 19, has been
set aside for the Roughs' Ball, to be
given for the benefit of the lire depart
ment. The old order will be reversed.
The bearded roughs will condescend to
be entertained inside the pavilion, and
plenty of boxes will be found around the
outside for the Roble delegation. Danc
ing and diversion, music and merriment,
and no end of surprises have been
planned by the committee in charge.
Twenty-eight members of the San
Francisco Firemen's Band of soloists will
furnish the music for the evening. The
services of these men were obtained
through the efforts of Fire Marshal Ed
Lamb, a personal friend of each and
every one of them. Marshal Lamb
speaks not of the Aeolian harp, of Or
pheus' pipes, of Bach, or Bock, or the
like of that when talking of good music.
He says that this band has no superiors
and few equals.
According to the committee com
posed of Hal Rourke, Phil Newill, and
Carl Shoup, the well and favorably
known cabaret will be imitated as faith
fully as possible from reports of bona
fide snakes. Those who have been to
the Hoo Hoo House, Bagdad, Olympia,
Columbia Inn, or any other of those
better cafes, will be gratefully listened
to by the committee. Historic accuracy,
just as in the Women's Pageant, is their
aim.
