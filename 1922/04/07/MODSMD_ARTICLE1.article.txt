# MIMES TO ME BEARS HERE TOMORROW
## Varsity Ready to Upset Dope, Guy Draper to Pitch Game; Freshmen Have Good Team 
### 
With a long list of defeats behind
them and the dope all against them,
Coach Seay's nine will meet the Blue
and Gold aggregation of the local field
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
In practice yesterday afternoon, the
Cards showed up well. There is no
getting around the fact that the varsity
is a good fielding machine. They know
how to handle the horsehide when the
other team is using the stick, but they
cannot seem to get their hitting stride.
Guy Draper will take the mound for
the varsity and upon the wor|c of this
veteran heaver the fate of the game
largely rests. If he can hold the bard
hitting Bruins within reasonable bounds,
the game should be close. Captain
Green is to do the receiving and his
generalship is another factor which
comparative scores and the old dope
bucket do not take into account. Green
has the ability to stiffen tlve team under
the strain of the tight places and it is
just that spirit which may give the
Cards a victory tomorrow.
"Bud" Woodward is to guard the
initial sack and it is certain that any
thing within grabbing distance will not
get away from "Bud." If the whole
team would show the same fighting spirit
that Woodward puts into the game,
there would be no question about the
outcome of tomorrow's clash.
Peavy is slated for the keystone.
Speaking of Claude, he just naturally
gets them. Maillot will take short and
Heckendorf the area around third.
With that combination between the
bases, the Bruins will have to aim care
fully or shoot high to get the sphere
past them.
For the outer gardens, five men are
in line for positions, and Seay has not
decided which ones will start the game.
Carver, Wayland, Parker, Ratner, and
Mitchell are the possibilities. Carver
and Wayland are probably the two
surest of the five when it comes to pull- !
ing down flies. Parker has been play
ing good ball and has done some good
stick work, but he is a little erratic.
Ratner and Mitchell can always be \
counted on to make a pitcher deliver j
the goods, but their work in the field
is not up to that of the other three.
Admission will be seventy-five cents
to the public and thirty-five cents to
students with student body cards. The
game is to be called promptly at 3 :30.
FRESHMAN BASEBALL GAME.
When the Bruin cubs trot out onto
the baseball diamond tomorrow morn
ing they will face one of the strongest
nines that has ever worn the Cardinal
numerals. The Stanford babes have
had a successful preliminary season,
winning sixteen games, losing two, and j
tieing one.
Kallam announced the line-up for to
morrow's game this afternoon. "Duke"
Follansbee is slated to start the game
on the mound. Follansbee has been a
consistent winner in the last few games.
He is a small man, but has a world of
speed, good control, and a good curve
ball. Jim Lawson will occupy the ot\ier
battery position. Lawson has been
somewhat hindered this season by an
injury to his leg, sustained in early sea
son practice, but he lias finally gotten
