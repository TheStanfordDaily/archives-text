# YEARLING TRACK SQUAD TO MEET BERKELEY BABES
## Cardinal First-Year Men Are Ready for Bruin Yearlings, Teams Are Evenly Matched 
### 
The 1925 track classic will start to
morrow, at 1:30, on the Stanford oval,
with the Stanford and California track
squads giving indication of putting up
a closer and more equal fight than
has been shown by freshman runners
for several years. Both teams have
their best men in the track events,
with Stanford having the edge in the
distances and and the Cubs in the
sprints. In the field events both are
considered to be weak, with the
Cards having strong contenders only
in the javelin, while Berkeley is as
sured of a victory in the pole vault.
The greatest weakness of the Babes
is, as was the case with the varsity
Wednesday, a lack of dependable men
for second and third places. Only
thirty-three Card yearlings are enter
ed, many of whom have only been out
since the spring quarter. On the other
hand, California is sending fifty rep
resentatives to the Farm, a number
having made a record for places in
•previous meets. Of the Stanford men
who are rated for first places, Thorn
ton in the hundred and 220, Shermund
in the quarter, Smith in the mile and
the two-mile, Leistner in the hurdle
events, and Righetti in the javelin,
are expected to take honors tomorrow.
Advance calculators can see from
the following comparative table what
prospects the yearlings will have to
morrow:
Hundred yards—Thornton (S.) and
Redman (C.) have both been clocked at
10.1, and will probably provide one of
the closest races of the meet for first
place; Farnesworth and Ryan (C.) will
light it out on equal terms, with Sher
mund and Tennant for second and third.
Two-twenty—Thornton and Sher
mund, twd of Stanford's fastest fresh
men, will enter against Ryan, who has
made 22.3, and Captain Redman of Cal
ifornia.
Quarter mile—Shermund assured of
first, but, with no other strong competi
tion, Gertz and Aggler (C.) will prob
ably make a close run for second and
third.
Half—Either Holmes or Dole are ex
pected to break in the lead with only
average time. Smith of Stanford will
try the place, but will save himself, in
case of a fast run, for the two-mile
event following.
Mile—Smith and Charles figured for
an easy first and second, with Carr (C.)
a probable third.
Low hurdles—Leistner, entering from
Palo Alto High, has made better time
than Lindstrom, U. C.'s strongest con
tender ; third place rated equally be
tween Silver (S.) and Wadsworth (C
High hurdles—Leistner again shows
better advance form than Cub entries;
California conceded second and third.
Broad jump—Both sides weak, with
Harrell (S.), jumping at 18.8 feet, a
possible winner.
High jump—Hess and Becker of Cal
into condition and is a valuable man be
hind the bat. He can also be counted
upon to do his share of hitting.
The babe infield is the strongest de
partment of the team. "Chuck" John
ston on first is playing good b;\Jl and
leading the team in hitting. "Shorty"
Roberts and Mulchay at second and
short are stopping all of the hot ones
that come near the keystone sack. Rob
erts is hitting the ball at a good clip,
and, although Mulchay is in a slump,
in his lead-off position he is bad medi
cine for any pitcher. Cuddeback will
play third, where he has been perform
ing well all season. Cuddeback is an
other dangerous hitter.
In the outfield, McCandless, Dick Law
son, and Hoffman will start. These men
have been pulling down the long ones
regularly, and are all good hitters.
The Bruin yearlings have been playing
a good brand of ball, and if comparative
scores mean anything, are evenly
matched with the Card babes. Although
they have not played as many games
as the Stanford freshmen, the cubs have
had an equally successful preliminary
season. They have been depending
mainly on two pitchers, a left-hander
and a right-hander.
The game will be played on the var
sity diamond at ten o'clock. Manouck
and Croter will handle the indicators.
How they will go to bat:
Stanford Freshmen —Mulchay, S. s.;
Roberts, 2d ; Cuddeback, 3d ; Dick Law
son. 1. 11 2.; McCandless, r. 11 2.; Johnston,
Ist; Jim Lawson, c.; Hoffman, c. 11 2.;

lansbee.
California Freshmen—Hall, r. 112.;

Keaney, s. s.; O'Rouke, Kelly, p.; Pa
vizza, 1. 11 2.; Rubin, c.; Shield, 2d. Util

resentatives to the Farm, a number
having made a record for places in
•previous meets. Of the Stanford men
who are rated for first places, Thorn
ton in the hundred and 220, Shermund
in the quarter, Smith in the mile and
the two-mile, Leistner in the hurdle
events, and Righetti in the javelin,
are expected to take honors tomorrow.
Advance calculators can see from
the following comparative table what
prospects the yearlings will have to
morrow:
Hundred yards—Thornton (S.) and
Redman (C.) have both been clocked at
10.1, and will probably provide one of
the closest races of the meet for first
place; Farnesworth and Ryan (C.) will
light it out on equal terms, with Sher
mund and Tennant for second and third.
Two-twenty—Thornton and Sher
mund, twd of Stanford's fastest fresh
men, will enter against Ryan, who has
made 22.3, and Captain Redman of Cal
ifornia.
Quarter mile—Shermund assured of
first, but, with no other strong competi
tion, Gertz and Aggler (C.) will prob
ably make a close run for second and
third.
Half—Either Holmes or Dole are ex
pected to break in the lead with only
average time. Smith of Stanford will
try the place, but will save himself, in
case of a fast run, for the two-mile
event following.
Mile—Smith and Charles figured for
an easy first and second, with Carr (C.)
a probable third.
Low hurdles—Leistner, entering from
Palo Alto High, has made better time
than Lindstrom, U. C.'s strongest con
tender ; third place rated equally be
tween Silver (S.) and Wadsworth (C
High hurdles—Leistner again shows
better advance form than Cub entries;
California conceded second and third.
Broad jump—Both sides weak, with
Harrell (S.), jumping at 18.8 feet, a
possible winner.
High jump—Hess and Becker of Cal
into condition and is a valuable man be
hind the bat. He can also be counted
upon to do his share of hitting.
The babe infield is the strongest de
partment of the team. "Chuck" John
ston on first is playing good b;\Jl and
leading the team in hitting. "Shorty"
Roberts and Mulchay at second and
short are stopping all of the hot ones
that come near the keystone sack. Rob
erts is hitting the ball at a good clip,
and, although Mulchay is in a slump,
in his lead-off position he is bad medi
cine for any pitcher. Cuddeback will
play third, where he has been perform
ing well all season. Cuddeback is an
other dangerous hitter.
In the outfield, McCandless, Dick Law
son, and Hoffman will start. These men
have been pulling down the long ones
regularly, and are all good hitters.
The Bruin yearlings have been playing
a good brand of ball, and if comparative
scores mean anything, are evenly
matched with the Card babes. Although
they have not played as many games
as the Stanford freshmen, the cubs have
had an equally successful preliminary
season. They have been depending
mainly on two pitchers, a left-hander
and a right-hander.
The game will be played on the var
sity diamond at ten o'clock. Manouck
and Croter will handle the indicators.
How they will go to bat:
Stanford Freshmen —Mulchay, S. s.;
Roberts, 2d ; Cuddeback, 3d ; Dick Law
son. 1. 11 2.; McCandless, r. 11 2.; Johnston,
Ist; Jim Lawson, c.; Hoffman, c. 11 2.;
Follansbee, p. Utilities: Brown, Con
ner, Grace, McDonald, Teague, and Fol
lansbee.
California Freshmen—Hall, r. 112.;
Hunt, c. 11 2.; Kyte, Ist; Macßea, 3d; Mc-
Keaney, s. s.; O'Rouke, Kelly, p.; Pa
vizza, 1. 11 2.; Rubin, c.; Shield, 2d. Util
ities; Wright, Bobbitt, Cheney, Spence,
Toomey, and Kelly.
The 1925 track classic will start to
morrow, at 1:30, on the Stanford oval,
with the Stanford and California track
squads giving indication of putting up
a closer and more equal fight than
has been shown by freshman runners
for several years. Both teams have
their best men in the track events,
with Stanford having the edge in the
distances and and the Cubs in the
sprints. In the field events both are
considered to be weak, with the
Cards having strong contenders only
in the javelin, while Berkeley is as
sured of a victory in the pole vault.
The greatest weakness of the Babes
is, as was the case with the varsity
Wednesday, a lack of dependable men
for second and third places. Only
thirty-three Card yearlings are enter
ed, many of whom have only been out
since the spring quarter. On the other
hand, California is sending fifty rep
resentatives to the Farm, a number
having made a record for places in

made 22.3, and Captain Redman of Cal
ifornia.
Quarter mile—Shermund assured of
first, but, with no other strong competi
tion, Gertz and Aggler (C.) will prob
ably make a close run for second and
third.
Half—Either Holmes or Dole are ex
pected to break in the lead with only
average time. Smith of Stanford will
try the place, but will save himself, in
case of a fast run, for the two-mile
event following.
Mile—Smith and Charles figured for
an easy first and second, with Carr (C.)
a probable third.
Low hurdles—Leistner, entering from
Palo Alto High, has made better time
than Lindstrom, U. C.'s strongest con
tender ; third place rated equally be
tween Silver (S.) and Wadsworth (C
High hurdles—Leistner again shows
better advance form than Cub entries;
California conceded second and third.
Broad jump—Both sides weak, with
Harrell (S.), jumping at 18.8 feet, a
possible winner.
High jump—Hess and Becker of Cal
into condition and is a valuable man be
hind the bat. He can also be counted
upon to do his share of hitting.
The babe infield is the strongest de
partment of the team. "Chuck" John
ston on first is playing good b;\Jl and
leading the team in hitting. "Shorty"
Roberts and Mulchay at second and
short are stopping all of the hot ones
that come near the keystone sack. Rob
erts is hitting the ball at a good clip,
and, although Mulchay is in a slump,
in his lead-off position he is bad medi
cine for any pitcher. Cuddeback will
play third, where he has been perform
ing well all season. Cuddeback is an
other dangerous hitter.
In the outfield, McCandless, Dick Law
son, and Hoffman will start. These men
have been pulling down the long ones
regularly, and are all good hitters.
The Bruin yearlings have been playing
a good brand of ball, and if comparative
scores mean anything, are evenly
matched with the Card babes. Although
they have not played as many games
as the Stanford freshmen, the cubs have
had an equally successful preliminary
season. They have been depending
mainly on two pitchers, a left-hander
and a right-hander.
The game will be played on the var
sity diamond at ten o'clock. Manouck
and Croter will handle the indicators.
How they will go to bat:
Stanford Freshmen —Mulchay, S. s.;
Roberts, 2d ; Cuddeback, 3d ; Dick Law
son. 1. 11 2.; McCandless, r. 11 2.; Johnston,
Ist; Jim Lawson, c.; Hoffman, c. 11 2.;
Follansbee, p. Utilities: Brown, Con
ner, Grace, McDonald, Teague, and Fol
lansbee.
California Freshmen—Hall, r. 112.;
Hunt, c. 11 2.; Kyte, Ist; Macßea, 3d; Mc-
Keaney, s. s.; O'Rouke, Kelly, p.; Pa
vizza, 1. 11 2.; Rubin, c.; Shield, 2d. Util
ities; Wright, Bobbitt, Cheney, Spence,
Toomey, and Kelly.
The 1925 track classic will start to
morrow, at 1:30, on the Stanford oval,
with the Stanford and California track
squads giving indication of putting up
a closer and more equal fight than
has been shown by freshman runners
for several years. Both teams have
their best men in the track events,
with Stanford having the edge in the
distances and and the Cubs in the
sprints. In the field events both are
considered to be weak, with the
Cards having strong contenders only
in the javelin, while Berkeley is as
sured of a victory in the pole vault.
The greatest weakness of the Babes
is, as was the case with the varsity
Wednesday, a lack of dependable men
for second and third places. Only
thirty-three Card yearlings are enter
ed, many of whom have only been out
since the spring quarter. On the other
hand, California is sending fifty rep
resentatives to the Farm, a number
having made a record for places in
•previous meets. Of the Stanford men
who are rated for first places, Thorn
ton in the hundred and 220, Shermund
in the quarter, Smith in the mile and
the two-mile, Leistner in the hurdle
events, and Righetti in the javelin,
are expected to take honors tomorrow.
Advance calculators can see from
the following comparative table what
prospects the yearlings will have to
morrow:
Hundred yards—Thornton (S.) and
Redman (C.) have both been clocked at
10.1, and will probably provide one of
the closest races of the meet for first
place; Farnesworth and Ryan (C.) will
light it out on equal terms, with Sher
mund and Tennant for second and third.
Two-twenty—Thornton and Sher
mund, twd of Stanford's fastest fresh
men, will enter against Ryan, who has
made 22.3, and Captain Redman of Cal
ifornia.
Quarter mile—Shermund assured of
first, but, with no other strong competi
tion, Gertz and Aggler (C.) will prob
