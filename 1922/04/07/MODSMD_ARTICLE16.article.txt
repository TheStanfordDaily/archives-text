# AN UNITED STATES PROJECT

### 
The location here of an experimental station by the
United States Government for study of the decidu
ous fruit cultivation is an important addition to the
possibilities for study of the fruit production in this
vicinity. Santa Clara Valley is probably the place
where more different kinds of fruits are grown than
any other place in the world and so is an ideal site
for the installation of such a station.
The exceptional library facilities that the Univer
sity offers makes study here easy and the matter of
a location for the farm is simple where it can be
placed in any one of so many spots on the campus.
Twenty acres will be the first unit, and the first work
taken up will be selection and breeding for study pur
poses only. No shipments-will be made at all for a
time, it being chiefly a government enterprise for own
research without the sending out of anything more
than literature at first.
This is a valuable addition to our plant here and
does not run in the same line as the state experiment
farms that are maintained throughout the state. It is
, a government help to this part of the country.
