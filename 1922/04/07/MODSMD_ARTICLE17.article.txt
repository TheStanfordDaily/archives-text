# UP AND AT 'EM

Something more than shouting made lumps in the
throats of several hundred Cardinal supporters at
the rally last night when "Dink" Templeton was
called on to tell some of the lown-down on the track
dope. The disparities in firsts and seconds being les
sened a long way from last season much is to be
hoped.
A roar that blew out the powder in the flash light
can so that pictures could not be taken heralded
"Pop" Warner's step to the stage. He and his assist
ant " Piny" Thornhill and Coach Hunt got a not-to
be-forgotten testimonial that we are behind them and
will do our best to help them do their stuff in making
up teams that will bring horn the good old pennants
that have been A. W. O. L. for several seasons.
