Four meets with the University of California will
he held over the week-end. The freshmen will tangle
in the annual track meet and both varsity and fresh
man nines will mix it here. The wrestlers go to
Berkeley.
The babe aggregations as far as track goes look
pretty even, with stars from the prep schools of the
state on both line-ups. Each team has a number of
men on it that are making fast time, and each is out
to cart away the bacon. The California youngsters
are coming down full of confidence, and our own
babes are going out with the idea of sending them
back with the empty sack.
The dope on baseball gives the Blue and Gold nines
a harder hitting average than our own clubs. We
have the advantage of having them down here, how
ever, and that makes it possible to turn out in force
to get behind our teams and cheer them on tojthe last
inning. They will do their best if we come out and
show them that we are backing them.
