# YE GOODE OLDE DANCE
## 
### 
Tomorrow night we have a chance to show if we
can bring back the good old time we mourn as lost
when Skull and Snakes throw their dance in the Pa
vilion. The society lias gone as far as it can to make
clear that what is necessary is nothing more than the
nominal fee to appease the doorkeeper. Not even a

date is needed. Perchance the hardy one who dares
might get over without the formality of any recent
hirsute operation. This is a real attempt on the part
of one organization to put us hack on the plane of
simple fun instead of the borcsotne round of "dress
up parties," and as such is worthy of our help in
making it a success. Drop around to Dad Moulton
and get some rub-down on the knees and then try a
few laps on the maple. Skull and Snakes makes the
offer of a return fare to anyone who does not get his
monev's worth in the evening.
