In order to be in line with the leading journals, Cab

number on this occasion. This is the UNEXPECTED
NUMBER.

ONE OF LIFE'S TRAGEDIES
The man stood before the mirror. You have often
done this very thing, so you know the technique.
On his face was an expression of irresolution, of pain,
of anger, of dismay. (For further terms see any good
dictionary). After several moments of irresolution, of
pain (see above), he made a complete analysis of the
situation. Not knowing what to do with it, he threw it
under the table. His face became contorted with pain
and anger; he made several incoherent gestures; he
tore his hair and part of his shirt; suddenly his face
.became fixed in set, hard lines. He would do it, he
would! Taking a firm grip of himself, he forced his
lagging arms and hands to perform the awful act. His
whole body tense, there was a short sharp struggle, a
muffled, gurgling cry—and the man walked triumphantly
from the mirror. He had fastened his collar!

OUR QUESTION BOX
Dear Editor: —How can 1 raise guinea pigs?
—AARA PLANE.
Dear Ara: —Put them on an elevator. —Ed.
* * *
Dear Editor: —I agree with what you say about kiss
ing, and don't do it. You should be commended for your
position on kissing. —DELLA DINGLE.
Delia Dingle:—'Who told you what my position on
kissing was? Ed.
* * *
WIRE BRIEFS
Hayfield, California. —A fire broke out here this after
noon and was put out before much damage could be
done by the volunteer fire department.
« * *
Bay Shore, California. —Residents on the edge ot' the
bay have developed quite an industry salvaging bottles
found floating in the bay. It is said that this means of
livelihood has sprung up in the last few years.
• * *
She never went to dances.
And never to a snow,
She wasn't seen in places,
Where lots of women go.
She hadn't any powder,
Or paint or likes of that,
She never bragged about herself—
She was the family cat.

CALIFORNIA PLANS
Now California's Stadium was to be of concrete hard,
For weeks its praise was sung by poet and by bard.
It was to have bronze tablets sunk for ever in its face,
It was to be the largest that could be found any place.
There were to be no knotholes in its arched and fluted
side,
It was to be the center of their spirit and their pride.
STANFORD PLANS
The Cardinals seemed to have no time for songs or for
campaigns,
They wanted to complete their "Dirt-pile", 'fore the
rains.
'Twas not for them the spreading arch or vaunting con
crete pier,
They had a lot of fool ideas they'd culled from far and
near,
And so they piled their mound on up. and nailed the
seats in fast,
And finished up both track and field —their "dirt-pile"
done at last.
CALIFORNIA STILL PLANS
The winter rains have come and gone, the Mound's not
washed away,
And yet the Californians have no place for the "Wonder
Team" to play.
Some want it here, and others there, the thing's in
hot debate.
And jokes about the "Dirt-pile" aren't so popular of
late!

SHEEPSKIN WARRIORS START
SPRING PRACTICE
Stanford's drybawl machine got off to a
* kick start this morning ai 2 o'clock, shoved
by "Sap" Boner and his lusty co-horts. They
will explain booting, knocking, signals, drop,
p "*' hitting the line, fake kick, delayed pass,
rr ' time out, aerial attack, sliding through on
open formation, and other rudimentary
forms, in the three months of spring work
out. The first few days will be devoted to
making up for lost wind.
In the opinion of Boner, it is the duty of
every man to turn out and jump in the spirit
of the thing up to his neck. This will give
a preliminary working knowledge of the
systems of those instructing and how to
work them.

STANFORD PLANS
The Cardinals seemed to have no time for songs or for
campaigns,
They wanted to complete their "Dirt-pile", 'fore the
rains.
'Twas not for them the spreading arch or vaunting con
crete pier,
They had a lot of fool ideas they'd culled from far and
near,
And so they piled their mound on up. and nailed the
seats in fast,
And finished up both track and field —their "dirt-pile"
done at last.
CALIFORNIA STILL PLANS
The winter rains have come and gone, the Mound's not
washed away,
And yet the Californians have no place for the "Wonder
Team" to play.
Some want it here, and others there, the thing's in
hot debate.
And jokes about the "Dirt-pile" aren't so popular of
late!

ONE OF LIFE'S TRAGEDIES
The man stood before the mirror. You have often
done this very thing, so you know the technique.
On his face was an expression of irresolution, of pain,
of anger, of dismay. (For further terms see any good
dictionary). After several moments of irresolution, of
pain (see above), he made a complete analysis of the
situation. Not knowing what to do with it, he threw it
under the table. His face became contorted with pain
and anger; he made several incoherent gestures; he
tore his hair and part of his shirt; suddenly his face
.became fixed in set, hard lines. He would do it, he
would! Taking a firm grip of himself, he forced his
lagging arms and hands to perform the awful act. His
whole body tense, there was a short sharp struggle, a
muffled, gurgling cry—and the man walked triumphantly
from the mirror. He had fastened his collar!

lagging arms and hands to perform the awful act. His
whole body tense, there was a short sharp struggle, a
muffled, gurgling cry—and the man walked triumphantly
from the mirror. He had fastened his collar!

She never went to dances.
And never to a snow,
She wasn't seen in places,
Where lots of women go.
She hadn't any powder,
Or paint or likes of that,
She never bragged about herself—
She was the family cat.

CALIFORNIA PLANS
Now California's Stadium was to be of concrete hard,
For weeks its praise was sung by poet and by bard.
It was to have bronze tablets sunk for ever in its face,
It was to be the largest that could be found any place.
There were to be no knotholes in its arched and fluted
side,
It was to be the center of their spirit and their pride.
STANFORD PLANS
The Cardinals seemed to have no time for songs or for
campaigns,
They wanted to complete their "Dirt-pile", 'fore the
rains.
'Twas not for them the spreading arch or vaunting con
crete pier,
They had a lot of fool ideas they'd culled from far and
near,
And so they piled their mound on up. and nailed the
seats in fast,
And finished up both track and field —their "dirt-pile"
done at last.
CALIFORNIA STILL PLANS
The winter rains have come and gone, the Mound's not
washed away,
And yet the Californians have no place for the "Wonder
Team" to play.
Some want it here, and others there, the thing's in
hot debate.
And jokes about the "Dirt-pile" aren't so popular of
late!

SHEEPSKIN WARRIORS START
SPRING PRACTICE
Stanford's drybawl machine got off to a
* kick start this morning ai 2 o'clock, shoved
by "Sap" Boner and his lusty co-horts. They
will explain booting, knocking, signals, drop,
p "*' hitting the line, fake kick, delayed pass,
rr ' time out, aerial attack, sliding through on
open formation, and other rudimentary
forms, in the three months of spring work
out. The first few days will be devoted to
making up for lost wind.
In the opinion of Boner, it is the duty of
every man to turn out and jump in the spirit
of the thing up to his neck. This will give
a preliminary working knowledge of the
systems of those instructing and how to
work them.
