# NEER AND DAVIES TAKE EXHIBITION FROM CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Captain Phil Neer and Jimmy Davies
defeated Wallace Bates and Irving
Weinstein yesterday afternoon in an
exhibition doubles tennis match staged
on the varsity courts, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2.
The match was closely contested
throughout and was one of the best
exhibitions given on the local courts
this year.
The visitors captured the first set on
the playing of Bates. The Cardinal pair
came through and won the next three
sets, playing a brand" of tennis that
marked their eastern invasion of last
summer. Neer played an exceptional
game for Stanford, using place shots to
a* good advantage. Jimmy Davies is
fast rounding into form and his fast
drives in the match yesterday had a
great deal ( to do with taking the bout
for Stanford.
The Stanford-California tournament
will be held at Berkeley Saturday, April
15, and is a part of the big athletic
program arranged by the Blue and Gold".
Special admission will be charged stu
dents, one ticket admitting them to all
contests, including the California-Mis
souri track meet and all baseball games.
No definite team has been picked to
play against the Bruin racket squad and
a great deal will depend upon the show
ing made by the players during the next
week. Richard Hinckley, Ted Mertz,
Norman Deback, Ford 1 ussing, B.
Leeds, and Jacie Neer are showing up
well on the courts now and the team
mates to Neer and Davies will probably
be picked from the above squad.
