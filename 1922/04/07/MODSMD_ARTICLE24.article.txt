# STANFORD MAT TEAM MEETS CALIFORNIA IN FIRST CONTEST
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's Cardinal
wrestlers will meet the Blue and Gold
squad in Harmon Gymnasium, Satur
day evening, at 8:00 o'clock. With
their win over U. S. C. last week, the
Cards look to be in the best of con
dition. Dope shows the teams to be
about evenly matched.
Chang, the clever Chinese bantam
weight of California, who won a de
cision over Fleming of Stanford last
year, will meet Sturm, the Card ban
tamweight. Sturm holds a win over
Hori, the Japanese wrestler of U. S. C.
Hosepian, the Cardinal lightweight,
will meet Taulver, a new man, who
placed second in a wrestling tourna
ment held recently at the Olympic
Club. Hosepian is in good form this
years and should win his match.
With Mercer laid up with an injured
ankle, Coach Maloney loses his best
bet in the 145-pound class. Newby,
the Bruin grappler, threw Mercer last
year, but Mercer has improved so
much that wrestling fans were look
ing for a close match this year. Bill
Fawcett, member of the freshman
wrestling squad two years ago, "Bevo"
Bailard and Vaughn Hosepian, are pos
sibilities for Mercer's place.
Fay is the California man whom
Johnson will meet. Fay is a new man
on the Bear squad, but comes well
recommended. The 175-pounder who
will face McKee of Stanford, is slow
and judging from the exhibition McKee
put up against Bragg, wrestling in
structor of the Los Angeles Y. M. G.
£ McKee should win his match.
The matches will be regulated by the
P. C. C. rules which provide for bouts
of seven minutes duration to be de
cided by the best two falls out of three.
If no falls occur, a decision will be
given. In case of a draw decision the
bout will be extended an extra seven
minutes. It is planned to have the
wrestling commissioner of the Olympic
Club referee the bouts.
