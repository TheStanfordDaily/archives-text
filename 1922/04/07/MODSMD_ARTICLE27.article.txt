# BABE TENNIS SQUAD TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
The babe racquet squad will meet the
California freshmen 011 the varsity
courts at 10 o'clock Saturday morning.
California lias one of the best net teams
in several years. Alec Wilson and Phil'
Bettens are the leading players on the
Bruin squad. It is likely, however, that
Bettens, who is coast junior champion,
will be unable to play Saturday.
The Cardinal team will be picked from
a squad composed of the following men:
Holmes, Logan, Willis, Aydelotte, Foye,
Murphy, and Price. Holmes lias been
showing up very well, playing a steady,
consistent game. The best doubles com

bination is Holmes and Logan. Logan's
accurate drives and strong volleying sup
plement Holmes' steady game.
Tlie first year squad has been practic
ing hard for several months in prepara
tion for its encounter with the Beat
cubs and is in the best of condition.
