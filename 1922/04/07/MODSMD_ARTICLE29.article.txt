# JAPANESE POLICIES WILL BE DISCUSSED IN LECTURE SERIES
## 
### 
Dr. George Gleason of Palo Alto will
deliver a series of lectures on "Japan
and Her Policies," in Room 5(5 of the
Education Building, the first occurring
Sunday morning, at 10 o'clock. The
lectures are primarily intended for
Stanford upperclassmen.
Dr. Gleason's treatment of the
Japanese question in his book called
"What Shall We Think of Japan," has
created a great deal of interest. Dr.
Gleason has been in Japan for twenty
years, during which time he has often
acted in unofficial advisory capacities
to Japanese authorities. During the
recent disarmament conference he
acted as intermediary between Japan
and the United States. At present,
he is devoting his time to a thorough
study of the Japanese question as it
exists in California.
