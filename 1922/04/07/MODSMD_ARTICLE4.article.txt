accomplished in the Junior national wa
ter polo tournament last fall. Coach
Brandsten has greatly strengthened his
team.
The St. Mary's team has greatly im
proved, according to dope that has
drifted down from the bay regions, since
they last appeared at Stanford in the
invitational swimming meet. The team
is built around Lane and Kuhane, two
Hawaiian swimmers that are well
known in the swimming world.
The freshmen will meet one of the
strongest teams in the state when they
confront Stockton High. The Stockton
athletic authorities have been' planning
on sending several of their swimmers
to the national interscholastic champion
ships which will be held in the East
within several weeks.
With the national diving champion
ships being held at the Olympic Club
tonight, Coach Brandsten has entered
A1 White and Don Snedden. White
has been the sensation of the Pacific
Coast this season and it would be no
great surprise if he would give his
former teammate, Clarence Pinkston, a
stiff battle for first honors. Pinkston
and White were both developed under
the expert coaching of Ernie Brand
sten. Pinkston is at present world's
champion. Besides these two stars,
Krisscl of the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, Kuehn of the Multonomah Club
of Portland, Patterson of the Olympic
Club, and Swenson of the L. A. A. C.
and several other contestants will try
for the honors.
At the same time as the diving cham
pionship is taking place the Pacific Ath
letic Association will hold its junior
100-yard breast stroke championship.
Schmeider and Kraemer will carry the
Cardinal colors in this event and from
their performances have Rood chances
of bringing back the honors. Charlie
Fletcher, who has starred in this event
for Stanford all this season, will not
be able to compete, as lie is a national
junior champion. A novice race has
also been placed on the program and
Coach Brandsten has entered Myers,
Klebahn, MacCallister, and Miller.
