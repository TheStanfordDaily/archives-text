# GOVERNMENT PUTS FRUIT EXPERIMEN STATION ON CAMPUS
## University Donates Twenty Acres to Form Grounds of New Addition to Stanford 
### 
An experimental station has been
established at Stanford, bu the United
States Government, to study the
propagation and improvement of the
deciduous fruit of the Santa Clara
Valley. Twenty acres have been set
aside by the University for the use
of the station.
W. F. Wright, a Stanford mail in
charge of the Chico experiment sta
tion, will be in charge here with Pro
fessor, Abrams of the Stanford Botany
department.
The Stanford campus offers the cli
mate of the Santa Clara Valley which
produces more kinds of deciduous
fruits than any other place in the
world and at the same time there are
the facilities of the library and labora
tories close at hand. All the products
of the station will be available to the
Stanford botanists.
It is the plan to carry on the experi
ments here for at least ten years with
the idea of enlarging the plant as pro
gress is made. The farm here will
in no way be the same as the agri
cultural and citrus station maintained
by the state and will not form a dis
tributing place for plants and trees
at present.
Later the material will probably be
distributed thruogh the state experi
ment stations but there will be no
distribution until the fruits raised here
are found to. possess real merit.
