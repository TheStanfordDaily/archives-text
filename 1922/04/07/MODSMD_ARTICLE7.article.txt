# CARDINAL BOXERS TO MEET TROJANS HERE IN RETURN TOURNEY
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity boxing squad will j
c ; loae a successful season next Tuesday I
evening, when the University of South-1
ern California pugilists invade the |
campus for a return tournament. The '
Cards annexed three of five bouts from i
the Trojans during spring vacation, i
and the dope shows that they will re
peat their performance next Tuesday i
evening.
U. S. C. will bring five men on the
trip. Abrams will Meet Kenny Ship
in the 145-pound class. Shipp has been
going after his opponents in whirlwind
fashion and has not lost a bout this
season. He is improving in every
match. Shipp is a hard man to hit and
unless Abrams shows a great deal
more stuff than the Card battler's
other opponents, the U. S. C. man will
have a. hard time staying the full time.
Eddie Matties, who had a hard time
defeating Johnnie Lane at Los Angel
es in four rounds will meet either
Jimmie Ross or Lane. Ross will prob
ably be out of the tournament as his
broken hand has not mended suffici
ently.
Galloway, who did not box at Los
Angeles, meets Jack Fishburn. Fish,
burn is a tough man for any opponent
and he is improving daily.
Fairbanks, Avho lost a decision to
Bill Burkhard in the south, is sched-1
uled to meet either Walt Bills or i
"Husky" Wassum. Fairbanks forced
Burkhard to extend himself to win
and will undobtedly be a hard man
to beat.
Covillo, who took the count of ten
when he stopped one of Wassum's
books in the last tournament, is to
meet either Wassum or Johnnie Lane.
Five freshmen will stage a ' battle
royal" as a. preliminary to the bouts.
A purse will be made up and given to
the winner.
The bouts will start at 7:30 and the
admission will be fifty cents or a stu
dent body card. Jimmie Britt, former
world champion boxer will probably
referee the bouts.
