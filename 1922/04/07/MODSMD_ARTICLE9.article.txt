# CARDINAL SPORT PROSPECTS TOLD AT SPRING RALLY
## New Stanford Coaches Predict Victories For Card Teams in Coming Athletic Events 
### 
1 "I feel assured that* you have here
' at Stanford, a team that knows foot
; ball, and with Stanford spirit, next
year's varsity will be a hard team to
beat," said "Pop" Warner, future foot
ball mentor of the Card eleven, last
night, at the first spring sports rally,
held in the new pavilion, in which
Stanford's three new grid coaches
were introduced. "You are not to ex
i pect too much at the start, because of
the difficulties which are bound to
arise under a new system of football
and under new coaches."
"I've already seen your crew and
your track teams perform, so that I
have been favorably impressed with
Stanford not only scholastically, but
athletically; and since I have been at
Stanford, this feeling has not been
diminished," Glenn Warner continued.
He vouched for the ability of Stan
ford's new assistant coaches, Claude
Thornhill and Andy Kerr.
"Andy Kerr, since 1915 has always
turned out a good freshman football
team at Pittsburgh. He is respected
and well-liked, and I know from my
j associations with him, that he will
render excellent service."
In speaking of Thornhill, Warner
j declared him to be one of the best
j linesmen ever turned out at the Uni
j versity of Pittsburgh, and one of the
big factors in the phenomenal success
of the Centre College football team.
"He is a quiet, unassuming man," was
Warner's comment of him.
Both Thornhill and Warner feel en
couraged with the interest shown in
spring football practice and speak for
a sucessful season if sufficient men
; come out. Warner declared that it
is not the size of the institution that
I determines what kind of a football
| team that institution will have, but
! the interest shown in the game, as
! rhanifested by the number of men who
I report for practice.
E. P. Hunt, who has successfully
I coached Berkeley High athletics for
j the past four years, and newly ap
! pointed Card freshman athletic coach,
! declared that he was ready to fit into
any scheme that Stanford may offer
him. "I assure you I will do all in
my power to teach the freshmen some
of the rudiments of the game, so that
when they are eligible for the varsity,
they will at least know the difference
between a football and a tennis ball."
"There is one possible exception to
California having the greate&t track
team in the United States, and that
exception may show up 011 the twenty
second of this month," said track coach
"Dink" Templeton. 111 preparing the
dope sheet for the annual varsity meet,
he advised fans to remember that in
last year's meet, California took all
points in five events, bringing her
total to 45 points and 50 with the re
lay. These weak points 011 the Stan
ford squad have been bolstered up
since then," said Templeton. "The
shot will make a difference of five po
ints, while the half-milers in my opini
on, are stronger than those of Cali
fornia. In the mile, we can probably
j upset the dope if Elliot can whip him
| self into shape within the next three
■ weeks. Minsky is going great in the
broad jump, but in the two-mile, we
| have made little headway."
111 discussing freshman track, Temp
leton declared that the class of 1925
would put over for the first time a
Stanford win. In comparing the two
squads of the rival schools, he said
that neither was especially strong.
Redmund and Goertz are California's
best bets in the dashes and quarter
mile, respectively, while Thornton and
Shermund are Stanford's.

E. P. Hunt, who has successfully
I coached Berkeley High athletics for
j the past four years, and newly ap
! pointed Card freshman athletic coach,
! declared that he was ready to fit into
any scheme that Stanford may offer
him. "I assure you I will do all in
my power to teach the freshmen some
of the rudiments of the game, so that
when they are eligible for the varsity,
they will at least know the difference
between a football and a tennis ball."
"There is one possible exception to
California having the greate&t track
team in the United States, and that
exception may show up 011 the twenty
second of this month," said track coach
"Dink" Templeton. 111 preparing the
dope sheet for the annual varsity meet,
he advised fans to remember that in
last year's meet, California took all
points in five events, bringing her
total to 45 points and 50 with the re
lay. These weak points 011 the Stan
ford squad have been bolstered up
since then," said Templeton. "The
shot will make a difference of five po
ints, while the half-milers in my opini
on, are stronger than those of Cali
fornia. In the mile, we can probably
j upset the dope if Elliot can whip him
| self into shape within the next three
■ weeks. Minsky is going great in the
broad jump, but in the two-mile, we
| have made little headway."
111 discussing freshman track, Temp
leton declared that the class of 1925
would put over for the first time a
Stanford win. In comparing the two
squads of the rival schools, he said
that neither was especially strong.
Redmund and Goertz are California's
best bets in the dashes and quarter
mile, respectively, while Thornton and
Shermund are Stanford's.
1 "I feel assured that* you have here
' at Stanford, a team that knows foot
; ball, and with Stanford spirit, next
year's varsity will be a hard team to
beat," said "Pop" Warner, future foot
ball mentor of the Card eleven, last
night, at the first spring sports rally,
held in the new pavilion, in which
Stanford's three new grid coaches
were introduced. "You are not to ex
i pect too much at the start, because of
the difficulties which are bound to
arise under a new system of football
and under new coaches."
"I've already seen your crew and
your track teams perform, so that I
have been favorably impressed with
Stanford not only scholastically, but
athletically; and since I have been at
Stanford, this feeling has not been
diminished," Glenn Warner continued.
He vouched for the ability of Stan
ford's new assistant coaches, Claude
Thornhill and Andy Kerr.
"Andy Kerr, since 1915 has always
turned out a good freshman football
team at Pittsburgh. He is respected
and well-liked, and I know from my
j associations with him, that he will
render excellent service."
In speaking of Thornhill, Warner
j declared him to be one of the best
j linesmen ever turned out at the Uni
j versity of Pittsburgh, and one of the
big factors in the phenomenal success
of the Centre College football team.
"He is a quiet, unassuming man," was
Warner's comment of him.
Both Thornhill and Warner feel en
couraged with the interest shown in
spring football practice and speak for
a sucessful season if sufficient men
; come out. Warner declared that it
is not the size of the institution that
I determines what kind of a football
| team that institution will have, but
! the interest shown in the game, as
! rhanifested by the number of men who
I report for practice.
