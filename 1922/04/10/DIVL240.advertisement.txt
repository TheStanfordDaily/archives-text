Which will next year's
captain wear?
IT DOESN'T need much wisdom to predict that
next year's nine will be captained by a '23
! man or maybe a '24 man.
This is no affront to underclassmen. Years of
steady plugging must go before you can handle the
man-sized responsibility of running a team.
That this is just, seniors will be the first to assert.
* They have seen how well it works for team and col
lege. Then let the seniors keep this point of view,
for soon they will find how closely the principle
applies to themselves in the business world.
Captains of industry are not made overnight.
Don't expect to step into a managership right
away. Before you can lead, you've got to serve
in the ranks awhile.
This is best for your organization and best for
you. The time and energy you put in working up
from the bottom, taking the bitter with the sweet,
t getting the upperhand over your job, will stand
you in good stead when you have won through
to executive position.
When you have learned how to handle detail
work, you can begin intelligently to direct other
men to do it, and thus free yourself for creative
planning.
ou who intend to be captains, have patience.
Your year will come and so will your chance.
