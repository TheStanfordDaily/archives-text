# CALIFORNIA BABES WIN TRACK MEET FROM STANFORD TEAM BY CLEAN SWEEP OF FINALS
## Righetti And Kern Break Records In Javelin And Discus; Final Score Is Closest In Years 
### 
California freshmen rolled up a victory
011 the Cardinal yearling runners in the
last three events of a stiff struggle on
the Stanford track Saturday, making a
final score of 73 1-2 points to the Cards'
57 1-2. After leading by a six-point
margin for eleven events, the babes
dropped the 220 and broad jump to Cali
fornia, and lost in the final stretch of
the relay, giving the vtibs 23 points in a
row.
Nevertheless, the Stanford freshmen
made a showing far superior to any made
in recent years, a snowing which indi
cates that the 1925 aggregation will be
come a formidable squad in later con
tests.
Two Stanford-California records were
toppled by contenders Saturday. Rig
hetti, Stanford, flung the javelin 173
feet 1-2 inch, passing well beyond the
mark of 158 feet 7 made by Harris
of California last season; Kern, Cali
fornia, tossed the discus 118 feet 5
inches, bettering the record of 117 feet
1 1-2 inches set by Berkey, U. C., in
1920.
Becker of California was high point
man for the meet, cleaning up first in
the high jump and seconds in the high
and low hurdles fen" a total of 11 points.
A1 Smith and "Swede" Leistner of Stan
ford were tied for second with 10 tallies,
Smith breaking the tape in the half and
mile, and Leistner coming iirst in both
hurdle events. Despite predictions that
Stanford would score 011 lirsts and Cali
fornia on seconds and thirds, the first
places were evenly divided, Stanford
getting seven to the Cubs' six, with the
Cubs taking the relay. Two unexpected
five-point tallies were registered for the
Cardinals, when Richards broke loose
and hurled the sixteen-pound shot 39
feet 3 1-2 inches for a first, and A1
Charles got away from his competitors
in the two mile.
Al Smith of Stanford jumped into the
electric glare through his consistent
speed in the distance events. He broke
across the line first in the mile with a
time of 4 minutes 39 l'-5 seconds, out

distanced his nearest competitor in the
half by ten feet after trailing for a lap,
registering five points with a time of
2:3 4-5, and, finally, made a fast sprint
around the oval in the relay, putting six
feet between himself and the California
man. He also entered the two mile, and
was getting set for a place in that event
when Coach Templeton took him out to
save him for the relay.
As usual, the relay furnished the
greatest thrills of the meet, even though
the victory had already been decided.
Stanford took the lead in the first lap,
when "Swede" Leisiner galloped out
ahead of Juch in the last fifty feet.
Davies of California nearly got ahead of
Dole in the second lap, but Smith re
