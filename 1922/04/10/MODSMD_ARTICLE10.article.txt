# FULL DAY PLANNED FOR FIREMEN FUND PROGRAM APRIL 19
## 
### 
A full day of entertainment, details
for which were arranged yesterday at
a meeting of the general committee,
is being planned to raise funds for
the campus fire fighters. Wednesday,
April 19, is the date of the program,
which includes a parade in Palo Alto
in the morning, a concert by the San
Francisco Fire Department Band in
the afternoon, and a "firemens" caba
ret" in the pavilion in the evening.
Money taken in at the evening en
tertainment will go toward buying ap
paratus and equipment for the fire
house and the men, which is not ab
solutely necessary but is highly de
sirable for making a more efficient
fire department. Almost all available
funds were used with the recent pur
chase of the Seagrave engine, and
Comptroller Roth did not feel that
the University could grant additional
money at this time.
The parade of Tiremen and band on
the Palo Alto streets at 10 o'clock in
the morning and the open-air concert
by a thirty-five piece band in front
of the new Union, at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, will be the free features of
the day. Six clever skits, including
numbers by Les Seib, '22, and Arnold
Bayley, '23, will be presented at the
dance in the Basketball Pavilion dur
ing the evening.
Those who are working out the pro
gram for the Fire Fighters' Fund Day
are:
General Committee —H. B. Rorke,
'24, chairman; Carl Shoup, '24, and
Phil Newill, '24.
