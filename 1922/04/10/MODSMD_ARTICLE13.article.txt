## Freshman Sluggers Knock Out Six Runs and Hold Yearlings from Across the Bag Scoreless 
### 
Coach Floyd Kallatn's babe nine com
pletely outclassed the Bruin cubs and
defeated them by a score of 6-0 in the
first game of the freshman series here
Saturday. The Blue and Gold yearlings
failed to show much strength in any de
partment of the game, and never threat
ened the Cardinal babes' lead during the
entire game.
Jimmie Aydelotte pitched a remark
able game for the Stanford freshmen, al
lowing but four hits, walking two men,
and striking out nine. He was in danger
only once, in the eighth inning when,
with two down, the cubs tilled the bases.
The big fellow tightened up at this point,
and the next man grounded out. In ad
dition to his performance in the box,
Aydelotte got two bingles and a walk in
four times at bat.
The Card yearlings started things in
the first inning, and before Nibs Price's
charges came down to earth, five runs
had crossed the plate. Mulchay, lead
off man, was safe on an error. Roberts
took first and Mulchay went to third
when Spence dropped a throw to first.
Kelly, the cub pitcher, was visibly nerv
ous and lie bit Cuddeback, filling the
bases. Dick Lawson walked and Mul
chay scored. McCandless was safe on a
fielder's choice, but Roberts was cut off
at the plate. Johnston laid down a
pretty bunt and Cuddeback scored. Jim
Lawson singled to left, scoring Dick
Lawson and McCandless. Hoffman re
ceived a pass, Lawson going to second.
Aydelotte singled to center and Jim
Lawson counted. Mulchay ended the
inning by striking out.
The Bear cubs tightened up after the
first inning, and although Kelly allowed
seven hits in the next eight innings, he
kept them well scattered except in the
fifth when successive doubles by John
ston and Jim Lawson accounted for an
other run. The Stanford freshmen
played their best game of the year in the
