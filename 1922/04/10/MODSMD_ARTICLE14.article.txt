# WHITE INS NATIONAL DIVING CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
The title of national fancy diving
champion was won by Albert White,
last Friday evening, in the Olympic
Club tank of San Francisco, when he
defeated Clarence Pinkston, former
title holder and world's high diving
champion and several other star per
formers. The scoring in the contest
was, White (Stanford), 435 points;
Krisell (L. A. Athletic Club), 419
points; DeFarrari (Olympic Club),
393.1; Pinkston (Olympic Club), 390.4.
The dives in which White displayed
the best form were the standing two
and a half, cut away one and a half,
and running gainer one and a half
back. White's victory is nothing short
of marvelous when it is considered
that he was practically an unknown
diver at the beginning of the school
year. Before entering Stanford, White
had done hardly any diving whatever,
but under the expert coaching of
Ernie Brandsten. has made rapid im
provement until he has reached the
position of being one of the world's
leading fancy divers. Great credit
should go to Coach Brandsten of the
Cardinal team, who has not only
taught White all the tricks of the div
ing game, but who also developed
Pinkston, present world's champion
high diver and former national cham
pion fancy diver.
