WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE
(P. I. X. S.). —Seventy freshmen were
today named on the honor roll for last
semester. To he eligible it was necessary
to have at least 8 hours of A and an
average of above 90 per cent.

Stanford 5, California 3—nine innings.
"You can't ever depend on a Stanford
team—to lose," remarked a visitor sour
ly after the baseball game here Satur
day afternoon.
There was plenty of basis for that re
mark. The Cardinal nine went into the
contest with 90 per cent of the outside
world, including the California baseball
squad, sure that a decisive victory would
be registered by the Blue and Gold. A
decisive victory was registered, per
schedule, but Stanford, not California,
attended to the registration.
Draper had the heavy sluggers of the
invaders helpless most of the game, and
not once did he lose command of the sit
uation. Each California batter, regard
less of what had gone before, found him
self facing a cool *and collected hurler
whose grin seemed to foretell death to
fat batting averages. Draper showed
good control, not allowing a single base
on balls. He received perfect, some
times brilliant, support in the field, not
an error being chalked up against the
varsity during the whole contest.
1 lie Cardinal attack* was not sensa
tional, but it was a fighting attack every
minute of the game, and it was strong
enough to win. Seven hits, one of them
a double by Green, were extracted from
Morrow's delivery. Draper helped the
family name by tearing off two hits.
Green got a single for his second safety,
and Woodward, Maillot, and Mitchell
accounted for the other three hits.
Whatever the cause may have been,
California's in field defense cracked with:
open time after time, and the Stanford
baserunners took an exhilarating advant -
age of these misplays. Six errors, most
of them on easy chances, helped the good
cause along. Drap'er was touched for
only seven hits, but four of them were
extra-base cracks, including a home run
iby Morrow and a triple by Thompson,
the catcher. G. Makin, playing second,
connected for a couple of doubles. A
word should be put in for the good work
of the California outfielders, in justice
to the Cardinal batters that were robbed
of more than one hit by swift work in
the outer garden.
The first four innings saw each side
get one hit but no results. Green opened
the second by singejng the horsehide for
a two-base smack past third. He ad
vanced to the latter bag on a wild pitch,
but died a lonely death when Peavy and
Heckendorf went out on infield ground
ers and Wayland whiffed.
In the fifth inning California dragged
out the silver platter, but Seay's men
didn't wait for it to be handed to them.
They went up and grabbed it. Hecken
dorf started off by drawing a walk. Dra
per got on first and Heckendorf went to
second when Morrow thought first base
was somewhere it wasn't and made a
wild throw. Mitchell came through with
a short hit that advanced each runner a
base, bulging the bags. Maillot rapped
out a grounder, and all hands were safe
when the California infield failed to get
Heckendorf at the plate. Woodward
drove a long fly out to left field, allowing
Draper to come in with the second run.
Parker was out, short to first, but on
Green's grounder the shortstop pegged
