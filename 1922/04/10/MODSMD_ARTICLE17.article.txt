# FIRMER FOUNDATION
## 
### 
Glenn Warner is a real coach and the type of man
Stanford students want the head of athletic en
terprises. Likewise Andrew Kerr. And while
mentioning coaches we would not think of leaving
out the name of "Dink" Templeton.
In placing these men at the head of two activities,
and providing a continuous policy in the sports, the
Board of Athletic Control has made up for a host
of deficiencies, possibly due to no fault, that have
handicapped progress for several years.
A full Stanford track team will go to Boston.
The baseball team will tour Hawaii. The tennis
men, we understand, will again go East. Our fresh
man football and baseball teams are this year pro
vided with a wider range of action than that of any
schedule on record. We have always desired and
needed such competition, though we realize the lack
of funds has prevented a previous expansion along
these lines. The Board of Athletic Control has put
Stanford in a position to engage in such expansion,
through its excellently planned and well-executed
stadium campaign, and we humbly voice our opinion
that in this the Board has moved in exactly the
right direction for the building of Stanford athletics.
On a par with the above moves of the Board is
the improvement in the Graduate Manager's office.
Long-standing tangles have been straightened out,
affairs are running smoothly, and we are beginning
to know what's what at the gymnasium. In taking
over the program selling and concessions at the Big
Game and subsequent events, the Board has pre
vented certain favored students from acquiring new
automobiles, but it has boosted the athletic income to
an extent that will more than cover the salaries of
the Graduate Manager's office. The Board or the
(Manager, or probably both, deserve the everlasting
appreciation of the student body in this move, for
grafting has been eliminated, money is saved to
athletics, and student purchasers are saved incon
venience, annoyance, and exhorbitant prices as well.
1 .William Fletcher's success in handling the affairs
of the office emphasises the wisdom of the Board in
selecting an older man for the job. Fletcher having
been a tniler, has the very important viewpoint of
the athlete as well as that of the executive, and is
able to conduct the affairs of both without infring
ing on either.
The major steps of the Board of Athletic Control
during the past year certainly indicates immense
progress, and are very encouraging to followers of
Stanford athletics. The financial handicap has been
removed, and the right men are being placed in the
right places. If the several vacancies for next year
are filled with Warner's, Templeton's, and Fletch
ers, there will be little but rejoicing among the Stan
ford student body.

to know what's what at the gymnasium. In taking
over the program selling and concessions at the Big
Game and subsequent events, the Board has pre
vented certain favored students from acquiring new
automobiles, but it has boosted the athletic income to
an extent that will more than cover the salaries of
the Graduate Manager's office. The Board or the
(Manager, or probably both, deserve the everlasting
appreciation of the student body in this move, for
grafting has been eliminated, money is saved to
athletics, and student purchasers are saved incon
venience, annoyance, and exhorbitant prices as well.
1 .William Fletcher's success in handling the affairs
of the office emphasises the wisdom of the Board in
selecting an older man for the job. Fletcher having
been a tniler, has the very important viewpoint of
the athlete as well as that of the executive, and is
able to conduct the affairs of both without infring
ing on either.
The major steps of the Board of Athletic Control
during the past year certainly indicates immense
progress, and are very encouraging to followers of
Stanford athletics. The financial handicap has been
removed, and the right men are being placed in the
right places. If the several vacancies for next year
are filled with Warner's, Templeton's, and Fletch
ers, there will be little but rejoicing among the Stan
ford student body.
Glenn Warner is a real coach and the type of man
Stanford students want the head of athletic en
terprises. Likewise Andrew Kerr. And while
mentioning coaches we would not think of leaving
out the name of "Dink" Templeton.
In placing these men at the head of two activities,
and providing a continuous policy in the sports, the
Board of Athletic Control has made up for a host
of deficiencies, possibly due to no fault, that have
handicapped progress for several years.
A full Stanford track team will go to Boston.
The baseball team will tour Hawaii. The tennis
men, we understand, will again go East. Our fresh
man football and baseball teams are this year pro
vided with a wider range of action than that of any
schedule on record. We have always desired and
needed such competition, though we realize the lack
of funds has prevented a previous expansion along
these lines. The Board of Athletic Control has put
Stanford in a position to engage in such expansion,
through its excellently planned and well-executed
stadium campaign, and we humbly voice our opinion
that in this the Board has moved in exactly the
right direction for the building of Stanford athletics.
On a par with the above moves of the Board is
the improvement in the Graduate Manager's office.
Long-standing tangles have been straightened out,
affairs are running smoothly, and we are beginning
to know what's what at the gymnasium. In taking
