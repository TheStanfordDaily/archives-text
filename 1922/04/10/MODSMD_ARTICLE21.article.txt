I go on the supposition that there's a lot of sur
prises in every meet, so why not dope it out on all of
'em being surprised? That's what I have done. Clup
this out, Cabbages, and see if I' mnot right on the 22d.
I'll get left if I'm not. Resp'tf'lly—

We advocate a "Use-Your-Hat-Week," now that the
"Eat-a-Prune-a-Day Week" and the "Electrify-Your-
Home Week" have passed. Palmolive Pete suggests
that there be instituted a "Cut-a-Class-a-Day Week," and
that it be made permanent, 52 times in the year.

Now that a new highway is to be built from San Fran
cisco down the peninsula, it might not be a bad idea
for everyone to rehearse carefully the State traffic rules
and memorize them carefully. Here they are:
1. Never turn to the right without putting out your
left hand, and never turn to the left without putting
out your right hand. If you're not going to turn at all,
put out both hands. If you're going{Ho stop, put out the
lights.
2. If you can't see around a corner, don't cut it. If
you can see around it, dou't turn. There would be no
kick to it then.
3. Don't turn around to talk to the passengers in the
back. Buy a roadster.
4. Honk at the car ahead when passing. It makes
them feel good.
5. Don't bluff a street car. You'll get called —above.
6. Don't park in front of a fire hydrant. Carry
Pyrene.

THE DEMON REPORTER
The wrestling teams got under way safely this after
noon at 2 p.m. The first bout was a safety match, as
both men took no chances on hurting anybody's feel
ing. Gargoyla, the visitors' entry, got an ear-hold in
the first ten minutes that would have been fatal had
the ear not been of tin and come oft". Manzuski, the
home entry, didn't have a tin toe, and so he lost, 7-6.
The second match wouldn't strike for a few minutes, but
one of the boys whispered something mean about the
other boy's grandmother, and in a second they were
down and at each other. Jimson, the home-talent, tried
to keep a good man down. Boola Singh, his opponent,
a headlock, and armlock and a padlock, but he couldn't
fasten on a scissors kick to the chin and scored the
first fall with a spring. The third match was a bout
to decide the championship, but it didn't go quite that
far. It was stopped by the umpire on account of cru
elty. Hawkshaw, the local flash, got a mean strangle
hold on the invader's ankle, and just wouldn't let go.
despite cries for mercy from the rooting sections. The
ring was cleared and presented to the champion for his
next engagement.

THE MID-DAY MEAL.
First Day
The prof hits the desk with resounding whacks
And tells of his course in a voice that cracks;
The students sit up, some even take down
What he says today of his own renown.
Worst Day
In a sing-song drone he raises his moan
On the greatest problem sinve Eve was a bone;
Says he: "Let me just suggest to you
The question of where to wear one's shoe."
Last Day
Every one is on ,edge, some even on less,
The professor's pants have a brand new press,
"There is no final, you will all get credit" —
And he beams at applause for lecture's merit.
• • *
We note with solemnity that some one has followed
the example of the illustrious gent who painted the
Pally post-office, and has flung the red on the city's fire
hydrants.

The wrestling teams got under way safely this after
noon at 2 p.m. The first bout was a safety match, as
both men took no chances on hurting anybody's feel
ing. Gargoyla, the visitors' entry, got an ear-hold in
the first ten minutes that would have been fatal had
the ear not been of tin and come oft". Manzuski, the
home entry, didn't have a tin toe, and so he lost, 7-6.
The second match wouldn't strike for a few minutes, but
one of the boys whispered something mean about the
other boy's grandmother, and in a second they were
down and at each other. Jimson, the home-talent, tried
to keep a good man down. Boola Singh, his opponent,
a headlock, and armlock and a padlock, but he couldn't
fasten on a scissors kick to the chin and scored the
first fall with a spring. The third match was a bout
to decide the championship, but it didn't go quite that
far. It was stopped by the umpire on account of cru
elty. Hawkshaw, the local flash, got a mean strangle
hold on the invader's ankle, and just wouldn't let go.

THE MID-DAY MEAL.
First Day
The prof hits the desk with resounding whacks
And tells of his course in a voice that cracks;
The students sit up, some even take down
What he says today of his own renown.
Worst Day
In a sing-song drone he raises his moan
On the greatest problem sinve Eve was a bone;
Says he: "Let me just suggest to you
The question of where to wear one's shoe."
Last Day
Every one is on ,edge, some even on less,
The professor's pants have a brand new press,
"There is no final, you will all get credit" —
And he beams at applause for lecture's merit.

We note with solemnity that some one has followed
the example of the illustrious gent who painted the
Pally post-office, and has flung the red on the city's fire
hydrants.

EVEN THORNHILL WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME

Dear Cabbages:—l am tired of all these guys that
try to guesa the results of the track meet on the 22d.
Why don't they gueßs it now, and be done with it?
Follow my system and you never lose. The results of
the meet will be: Stanford, 80; California, 40. Here is
the way the events will run:
100-yard dash —Hutchinson, Hartranft, Sudden. Time,
11 flat.
220-yard dash —Sudden, Hutchinson, Kirksey. Time,
unknown.
440-yard dash —Saxby, Mac Donald, Clarke. Time, also
unknown.
Half-mile —Tie for first between Pierce, Macintosh
and Daly.
Mile —Tie for first between Elliott, Denton, Fiske, and
Kitts.
Two-mile —Will not be run, due to heavy wind.
Low hurdles —Henderson, first. Everybody else will
knock over four hurdles. Time, 18 flat.

hurdles.

I go on the supposition that there's a lot of sur
prises in every meet, so why not dope it out on all of

try to guesa the results of the track meet on the 22d.
Why don't they gueßs it now, and be done with it?
Follow my system and you never lose. The results of
the meet will be: Stanford, 80; California, 40. Here is
the way the events will run:
100-yard dash —Hutchinson, Hartranft, Sudden. Time,
11 flat.
220-yard dash —Sudden, Hutchinson, Kirksey. Time,
unknown.
440-yard dash —Saxby, Mac Donald, Clarke. Time, also
unknown.
Half-mile —Tie for first between Pierce, Macintosh
and Daly.
Mile —Tie for first between Elliott, Denton, Fiske, and
Kitts.
Two-mile —Will not be run, due to heavy wind.
Low hurdles —Henderson, first. Everybody else will
knock over four hurdles. Time, 18 flat.
High hurdles —Will not be run, due to lack of
hurdles.
High Jump—Dalton, Treyer, Muller. Height, 5 ft. 16
inches.
Broad jump—Minsky, Boren, Merchant.
Pole vault—Black, Dennis, Norris, Graham and Wil
cox tied for third. Height, over eleven feet.
Discus and Shot put —Hartranft.
Javelin —Hanner.
Relay—Dead heat.

I go on the supposition that there's a lot of sur
prises in every meet, so why not dope it out on all of
'em being surprised? That's what I have done. Clup
this out, Cabbages, and see if I' mnot right on the 22d.
I'll get left if I'm not. Resp'tf'lly—

We advocate a "Use-Your-Hat-Week," now that the
"Eat-a-Prune-a-Day Week" and the "Electrify-Your-
Home Week" have passed. Palmolive Pete suggests
that there be instituted a "Cut-a-Class-a-Day Week," and
that it be made permanent, 52 times in the year.

Now that a new highway is to be built from San Fran
cisco down the peninsula, it might not be a bad idea
for everyone to rehearse carefully the State traffic rules
and memorize them carefully. Here they are:
1. Never turn to the right without putting out your
left hand, and never turn to the left without putting
out your right hand. If you're not going to turn at all,
put out both hands. If you're going{Ho stop, put out the
lights.
2. If you can't see around a corner, don't cut it. If
you can see around it, dou't turn. There would be no
kick to it then.
3. Don't turn around to talk to the passengers in the
back. Buy a roadster.
4. Honk at the car ahead when passing. It makes
them feel good.
5. Don't bluff a street car. You'll get called —above.
6. Don't park in front of a fire hydrant. Carry
Pyrene.

THE DEMON REPORTER
The wrestling teams got under way safely this after
noon at 2 p.m. The first bout was a safety match, as
both men took no chances on hurting anybody's feel
ing. Gargoyla, the visitors' entry, got an ear-hold in
the first ten minutes that would have been fatal had
the ear not been of tin and come oft". Manzuski, the
home entry, didn't have a tin toe, and so he lost, 7-6.
The second match wouldn't strike for a few minutes, but
one of the boys whispered something mean about the
other boy's grandmother, and in a second they were
down and at each other. Jimson, the home-talent, tried
to keep a good man down. Boola Singh, his opponent,
a headlock, and armlock and a padlock, but he couldn't
fasten on a scissors kick to the chin and scored the
first fall with a spring. The third match was a bout
to decide the championship, but it didn't go quite that
far. It was stopped by the umpire on account of cru
elty. Hawkshaw, the local flash, got a mean strangle
hold on the invader's ankle, and just wouldn't let go.
despite cries for mercy from the rooting sections. The
ring was cleared and presented to the champion for his
next engagement.

THE MID-DAY MEAL.
First Day
The prof hits the desk with resounding whacks
And tells of his course in a voice that cracks;
The students sit up, some even take down
What he says today of his own renown.
Worst Day
In a sing-song drone he raises his moan
On the greatest problem sinve Eve was a bone;
Says he: "Let me just suggest to you
The question of where to wear one's shoe."
Last Day
Every one is on ,edge, some even on less,
The professor's pants have a brand new press,
"There is no final, you will all get credit" —
And he beams at applause for lecture's merit.
• • *
We note with solemnity that some one has followed
the example of the illustrious gent who painted the
Pally post-office, and has flung the red on the city's fire
hydrants.
* * •
EVEN THORNHILL WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME
WITH THIS LINE.
First prize (flat-bottomed discus) —To the gent that is
so dumb he thinks Nova Scotia is a great opera singer.
Second prize (steam-heated fountain pen)—To the
gent that is so dumb he thinks they make pianos in the
Grand Canyon.
