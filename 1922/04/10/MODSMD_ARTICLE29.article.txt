# BEAR MATMEN DEFEAT CARDINAL WRESTLERS
## 
### 
Vaughn Hosepian, lightweight, was
the only Stanford man to win his
wrestling match, scoring two falls
over Taulver, of the Bruins, in 'the
Card-Bruin contest, Saturday night.
According to P. C. C. roles, each
match was divided into two periods
of seven minutes eoch with a seven
minute rest between each go. While
one weight was wrestling one was rest
ing.
Chang, bantamweight, repeated his
performance of last year winning two
falls over "Shorty" Sturm of Stan
ford. In the first period Chang was
able to clamp a body scissors om
Sturm, which the latter, despite his
struggling was unable to break, the
match resulting in a fall for Chang
after five minutes. In the second
round Sturm secured a head scissors
on his Chinese opponent, who stood
up and whirled him in the air and then
fell backwards 011 him. Chang broke
Sturm's head scissors, and in turn ap
plied his reliable body hold to such
an advantage that he won a second
fall.
Coach Andrews told Hosepian when
he stepped into the ring to meet Taul
ver, the much touted lightweight
wrestler, "Young man, you'll last about
two minutes." But Hosepian proceeded
to show Andrews that his statement
was wrong, for in five minutes he pin
ned his opponent's shoulder to the
mat with an arm bar and a half-Nel
son. In the second period Hosepian
repeated the performance, but took
only Iwo minutes this time to com
plete the fall.
Bailard, weighing 135 pounds, enter
ed the ring to fill the shoes of Mercer,
the regular welterweight who has an
injured ankle. Newby of California,
veteran of last year's team, threw
Bailard the first time in three min
utes, using a body scissors, and in
the second round he threw him in two
minutes with the same hold.
In the 158-pound class, Fay of Cali
fornia outclassed Johnson of Stanford
although the latter was the huskier.
McKee of Stanford entered the 175-
pound class, weighing only 162 pounds,
while his opponent, Riskin, had 15
pounds to his advantage. McKee was
much the faster but lacked the bull
strength of the adversary. A body
scissors forced McKee to give up. Mc-
Kee returned in the second perior with
vengeance in his eye. With a half-
Nelson he almost floored Riskin, but
the latter slipped the hold and in turn
tossed McKee to the mat for a fall.
