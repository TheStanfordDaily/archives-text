# STANFORD'S WATER POLO TEAM DEFEATS CALIFORNIA MERMEN
## 
### 
The Cardinal varsity water polo
team completely outplayed the Cali
fornia squad in their annual contest
and romped away with the honors with
the score of 10 to 1, at the Encina
Pool, last Saturday morning. The Blue
and Gold squad were on the defense
nearly the entire game.
Coach Brandsten's team started
right off from the beginning and it
was hardly a minute before the Cardi
nal squad had picked a hole in the
Bruin defense. Stern accounted for
the first tally. The second score came
when Fletcher passed to Lacey, who
was near the side of the tank. Lacey
made a long throw to the cage. Mil
ler scored the next goal and then
Dickey added two more. The half
ended shortly after Fletcher had
placed the ball in the goal for the
sixth tally. The team-work and the
passing of the Cardinal team was far
superior to the work of the California
squad. >
With the opening of the second half
Podesta replaced DeGroot as goal
keeper. The Card paddlers began the
attack again with the result that Lacey
and Dickey each found the goal.
Robertson, the star forward of the
California team, got himself loose
long enough to break through the
Cardinal defense and thus kept the
Bears from being blanked. Dickey
and Lacey continued their scoring
activities by each accounting for a
point.
Although Dickey scored four points
and Lacey three, the credit for the
overwhelming victory must go to the
machinelike team work that was
shown throughout the contest. Cali
fornia had a team composed of veteran
water polo players but they lacked
teamwork. The guarding of Coach
Brandsten's aggregation prevented the
Bears from getting many chances to
score. Georfe Lineer of the Pacific
City Club refereed the contest.
The line-up of the teams was as
follows:
Stanford—Forwards, Lacey, Dickey,
Miller; backs, Austin, Fletcher, Stern;
goal-keeper, DeGroot, Podesta.
California — Forwards, Robertson,
Mitchell, Harrison; backs, Lockhardt,
O'Conner, Brennan, Sharp; goal-keep
er, Schubert.
