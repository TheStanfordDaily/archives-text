# Canoe Rescues Crew of Capsized A.T.O. Craft; Skipper Sticks to Last
## 
### 
In an attempt to outdo Sir Thomas
Lipton in modern yachting on a heavy
running sea, the crew of the A. T. O.
sailing vessel met with a wet fate
when the sturdy craft capsized Satur
day afternoon. The crew which con
sisted of Ten Van Deusen and George
Houck, violated all navigation and
maritime laws when they attempted
to brave the gale without the one im
portant feaLure of a yacht, namely, a
keel. With all the canvas spread, the
boat was speeding towards the center
of the lake, when the winds gave it a
side slap, and forced the crew to leave
their vessel. To Van Deusen goes the
supreme naval honor of being the last
to leave his ship. The men were able
to reach the drain pipe before R. E.
McDonald reached them with the life
boat.
