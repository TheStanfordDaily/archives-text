# TROJAN TRACK STARS HERE FOR CARD MEET
## 
### 
George Schiller, the spectacled
quarter-miler, and other Trojan track
and field stars, were expected to arrive
here today for the return meet with
the Cardinal squad, Wednesday after
noon, on the local cinder-path.
Schiller and his associates, who num
ber about altogether, have been en
tertained over at Berkeley by Walter
Christie's Bears, who piled up a 92
to 34 victory. The U. S. C. delegation
has hopes of doing better against the
Cards, as only seven of them broke
into the point column last Saturday.
In the past two years, the Trojans
have been known as Paddock <& Co.,
with the famous sprint champion in
the title role, and a Kirksey-Paddock
duel featured every U. S. C.-Stanford
meet. This year, however, Schiller
has advanced to the position formerly
held by Paddock, who is now busy
running exhibition races.
Fans will see something almost as
exciting as a race between Kirksey and
Paddock when Schiller, and William
son, the Stanford star, hot-foot it
around the track in the 440 yard dash.
The southerner holds one decision over
Williamson this year, when he won on
his oval, but as far as times go the
Cardinal flash has all the better of
the argument.
"Tiny" Hartranft shattered a couple
of record opposing Evans and Boyle
of U. S. C. in the weight events at
Los Angeles, and with the same gents
in the competition again, the blond
youth may repeat. Whatever points
the Trojans annex in the pole vault
wil lbe due to the efforts of Emmons,
who is credited with a mark of 12
feet in that event. He and Davis are
southerners' only hopes in the high
jump.
