This year Comptroller llotli has spent more money tor tire protection
than has been used during the last five years. The reason is that he isi an
alumnus of this university and, like all broadminded men, he realizes tlia
when the parents of twenty-five hundred young men and women send then
children to the university tliey expect that they will he cared tor from a
angles and protection from fire is one of these.
Stanford University is the only institution of its kind that maintains its
own fire department. The personnel of this department consists of a lire
Marshal a Fire Chief, and ten assistants. In order to build up an efficient de
partment. the morale of these ten men must he kept up. I have been in then
place and I know. They need attention.
For example, wtien the men went up the stairway to fight the fiie under
the roof of the Delta Kappa Epsilon house, they had no fire turn-out clothes
or helmets. Hot coals were falling all about. Live fire dropped 011 their un
covered heads and some were burned. But they stuck. They deserve the
protection proper clothing would give them.
When a fire has occurred heretofore, things have been thrown out or
windows and considerable destruction has resulted. Insurance does not cover
these broken articles. The company's liability ceases as soon as the furni
ture has been taken from the property. '
It is necessary for the department to have canvas covers to throw over
furniture protecting it from water and sparks. Fire fighting is not to destroy
but to prevent destruction. An improperly equipped department can do as
much damage with water as a good-sized fire can without water.
In 1917 the Menlo Park Fire Department was organized. The insurance
rate at that time was $1.45. Since then, year by year, the rate has decreased
until now it is maintained, with the co-operation fo the citizens, at the lowest
possible rate—$0.45. The more efficient the Stanford Department is, the
lower the rates will be. A contribution is an investment.
1 could go 011 and record many other things which are necessary for the
comfort of the men. but I know that Mr. Roth does all that he possibly can.
The Comptroller's office works on a September to September budget, and an
unusual amount has been spent already this year—easily the limit for the
big new Seagravc engine and other new equipment and overhauling jobs. To
bring the department to a metropolitan standard is my aim. For the uni
versity to own a complete fire house equipment is highly desirable.
It. is for these improvements, of prime importance, that I understand the
Student Body's Fire Fighters' Fund committee is working.
August io to 15 the fire chiefs of the world will convene in San Fran
cisco. Fire engineers from England, France, Scandinavia, Canada. Peru,
Africa, and from every other place which has a fire protection organization,
will undoubtedly visit the only American university department. I hope it
will be a model by that. time.
I know the San Francisco Fire Department Band, thirty-five pieces, is a
good musical organization. I have confidence that the entertainment at the
Fireman's Cabaret will be excellent and feel sure that the campus roughs
will have a good time while giving us individual aid.
