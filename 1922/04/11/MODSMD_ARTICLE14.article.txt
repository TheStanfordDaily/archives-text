# Cardinals and Trojans Compete on Track This Afternoon; Howell is Out
## 
### 
Several private track feuds were car
ried on at the Cardinal oval thi-s after
noon when a small coterie of stars from
U. S. C. bumped up against Templeton's
varsity squad.
Mint Howell, Stanford's only high
jumper, is laid up with the influenza, and
will be out for another week. His ill
ness gave the U. S. C. jumpers, Emmons
and Davis, the edge for both first and
second on the event.
Against the California aggregation the
nine 1 rojans amassed a total of thirty
four, with Schiller out of the quarter.
With Howell out of the competition, the
U. S. C. total this afternoon was figured
around thirty-five, while Templeton's
charges were doped to score about ninety,
with all of the events run off except the
relay.
