# CHARGING SLED IS PROVIDED TO TRAIN HARD-HITTING LINE
## 
### 
A new type of charging sled, provided
by "Pop" Warner and C. E. Thornliill
for the development of the line-plunging
abilities of the spring football tryoutees,
lias proved a big success in the first few
days of its use.
The sled consists of seven upright
posts set on a base that is provided with
runners, making it possible to slide the
entire frame along the ground. On each
post is sufficient padding to keep neck
and shoulders "from being injured. The
idea of the sled is to have it represent
an opposing line; the prospective ends,
tackles and guards line up and "buck
the line" five or ten feet across the
ground.
In order to make tne men charge low.
the padding is placcd on the lower part
of the upright posts, and the line candi
dates soon get the idea of "hit 'em
low."
After the workout last week, the sled
was badly in need of more bolts and
nails, and one of the upright posts had
been torn from its foundations by a
I husky tackle.
Backfield men were under Warner s
care most of the practice time, and were
drilled in handling the ball, taking off
for runs, and in some of the rudiments
of their positions.
Twenty-seven backfield men were in
uniform last week, and "Tiny" Thorn -
hill had thirty-eight prospective linemen
working the sled around and around the
stadium, or tearing the tackling dummies
from the hooks.
