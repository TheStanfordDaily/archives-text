# SANTA CLARA NINE PLAYS CARDINALS ON DIAMOND TODAY
## 
### 
Santa Clara is the baseball nine that
Seay's varsity is facing this afternoon as
a warming-up test for the second game
of the Big Series with California, which
occurs on Saturday. The Saints have
shown some good playing in their con
tests with the Cardinal so far this sea
son, and have been slated to offer the
varsity some tough opposition.
Now that the smoke of Saturday's
battle has blown over, it is possible to
look forward to the remaining two
games of the scries with the Blue and
Gold. Regardless of who wins this next
game, there will be a third contest played
at California on the afternoon of April
J2, following the track meet.
The Bruin nine has undoubtedly real
ized by this time that this year's series
is no set-up, and they should be able to
offer stronger opposition in the second
game. Overconfidence marred almost
every play in this last fracas, and it is a
sure thijjg that that overconfidence has
received a hard blow. Both teams will
have to play a better brand of ball than
they exhibited last Saturday if they arc
to win this coming week-end. In all
probability th<;re will be no silvej- plat
ters passed around again, unless one nine
or the other cracks open under the strain.
It is the usual thing in any series for the
teams to tighten up with each successive
game, especially when the last contests
are the most important. "Usual things,"
however, mean nothing half the time in
baseball, so that a bush league score will
be by no means an impossibility.
