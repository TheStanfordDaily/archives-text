# MORE SPEED LESS CARS
## 
### 
Complaints come in again of students breaking
laws pertaining to speed on the campus. Palo Alto
authorities say that the students take delight in
dashing from the tracks in Palo Alto to the entrance
of Palm Drive and then "giving her the gas" and
vanishing up the drive with a horse laugh for the
motor cop, who does not have jurisdiction on
campus property. There is a certain amount of
truth in this, because the straight-away on Palm
Drive does offer a beautiful run for the record
buster who makes the walls of the Quad tremble
'as he goes rushing by with the cut-out open and all
six hitting pretty.
No action has been taken by the University au
thorities in connection with student-operated autos
because it is the University policy to keep away
from parental power exercising as much as possible.
But the Comptroller's office has had notice of many
violations of late and will be forced to act if the
abuse of privilege in running cars on the campus
is not stopped. As a matter of justice to the large
number of people who operate cars on the campus,
the violators should stop their persistent road races
from hither to yon about the campus and its en
virons. If these infractions of rules are not stopped,
not only the guilty but the whole body of student
car operators will be jerked up on the carpet and
the rights of all will be curtailed.
