To make possible the purchasing of modern pro
tective appliances for the Stanford fire fighters a
grand evening of sports, cabaret, and band music
from the Stanford Band and the band from the
San Francisco lire Department will be given
Wednesday, April 19. Since the installation of
Eddie Lamb as fire marshal here the Comptroller
has been able to make many improvements in the
matter of fire prevention, with new high-pressure
lines about the campus to hitherto unprotected spots
and the addition of the new chemical engine. The
fire house is being enlarge to properly contain the
new equipment and the old Cadillac is being made
over for extra service, as is the Ford truck.
There are canvas covers needed for furniture in
houses that may be drenched in time of fire, and
also a need of fire-proof coats for the firemen. In
the Delta Kappa Epsilon fire, the last one of good
proportions on the campus, the men had to go into
the third floor while the roof was a blazing inferno
above their heads and coals were falling on their
bodies. The work was done well, but these men
were exposed to unnecessary danger. It is to get
clothes which will make it safe for these fighters
that the proceeds will go on the night of the fire
men's benefit. The entertainers are doing their
part for nothing, so there will be 110 money-making
on the side. We will get the whole benefit in added
protection to our property, and perchance our lives.
