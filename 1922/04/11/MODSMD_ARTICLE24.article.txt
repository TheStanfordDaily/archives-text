FIRE!

By the looks of the Firemens' Cabaret, it might be
said that someone is going to have a hot time.
* * *
Campus experts have estimated that the party should
appeal to almost everybody the exception of the
Y. W. C. A. members. After hearing their rendition
of "I'm a Little Prairie Flower," at the recent "Y"
banquet, professional men agree that it will be hard
to find hardened enough firemen for escorts.

COFFEE DAN says that he knows a lot of wise cracks
about Cabarets, but he can't seem to clean any of
them up.

The San Francisco Fire Department Band will easily
stage a wash-out, if not a knock-out.

Arrangements are yet to be completed with the
manager of the new union for having the meal served
early, in, order that the soup course can give volume
to the 4:00 o'clock concert.

Whether anybody gets mad or not, they'll see a lot
of red a week from Wednesday.

SPRING!
To eyes of deep, mysterious blue,
Or golden locks with silken sheen,
About the heart so staunch and true —
I'll e'en enthuse to Johnny Breen.
If write I must, perchance I will
Knock off a word for starving art;
And, though another's tossed this pill
Before, I'll rave on Cupid's part.
Of roistering and wassailing cry
Right gladly I'll the welkin ring
But I'll be damned if ever I
Will write a line for Spring.
—'N. R. G.

It's about time some other selection was written to
take the place of "Smiles." Somebody might write a
special tryout piece with "Groans" as the title. This
could be used for working out dancers as well as sing
ers.

It could also be made into a phonograph record.
There would be a great sale among "colyumists."

Following out the industrial idea of working to music,
it could be put in every classroom during examination
week.
* ♦ *
No end of editorial offices, dentists' waiting rooms,
offices of professors-who-teli jokes, committee meetings,
council conference and the like could be made hearable
by a pleasantly doleful "Groans."
• * *
Junior Opera tryoutees may not know enough to
pound sand into a rat hole, but if it was a respectable
rat and kept decent rooms next to the floor, they might
be very useful in kicking sand in.
* * *
A short sleeved dress coat has nothing to feel elated
about. Other things are easily as graceful.

As Ethel said to Methyl, "That's what the freshmen
are for." So saying he left Methyl's house and arriving
home, called one of his own cohorts to help him up
stairs.

Kid Nicotine —I bet I can lay off smoking longer than
you can. «
Tobaccanalian —If you want to play hide and seek, say
so like a man.

The thing that puzzles BLUE BELLE is the matter
of unofficial awards. Now that the bar "S" goes to
managers, there is nothing left to parallel the snake
"5"... Why do they give the managers the bar "S"?

Now that Easter is so near at hand it might be said —
A POKE ON THE HEAD IS WORTH TWO ON THE
JAW.
