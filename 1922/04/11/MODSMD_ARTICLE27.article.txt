## 
### 
Co-operative buying placed on an en
tire university basis—with ten sororities,
twenty-three fraternities, six eating clubs,
anfl the R. O. T. C. bachelors' mess rep
resented—will be described in the
April Pictorial, to be off the press Fri
day, by Milton Drey fuss, '24. Details of
the system, which include quantitative
purchasing, reductions, deliveries, quality
of foods, and so forth, have been worked
out by Harold Swett, '20. appointed
chairman of the co-operative buying
committee of the Inter fraternity Council,
and are fully described in the coming
issue of Pictorial.
Defending the policy governing pub
licity of the university, attacked by "Bob"
Donaldson, '17, in the March Pictorial,
K. N. Stewart, '23, shows just how news
papers would receive such a plan as sug
gested by Donaldson, and, which is more
important, what would receive the news
sent out under the proposed scheme.
