# SIGMA CHI TAKES FIRST INTRAMURAL BASEBALL CONTEST
## 
### 
The intramural baseball season
started yesterday afternoon with three
games on the schedule. The most
closely contested game of the day
was in League Five, between Sig√üia
Chi and Delta Kappa Epsilon. Sigma
Chi taking the honors by a 3 to 2
score. Fox did the twirling for the
winners and held his opponents in the
pinches. Dallas did the receiving.
Meekin's four-base jolt in the first
inning was the turning point, and
started Sigma Chi on its road to vic
tory. Howard and Litle did battery
duty for Delta Kappa Epsilon.
Two of the scheduled games were
postponed, off-campus defaulting to
El Cuadro and Sequoia No. Two, de
ferring their game with Delta Upsilon
until later because of lack of equip
ment.
Phi Gamma Delta and Sequoia No.
One put on a tight game for three
innings, but the former manager to
solve Chedister's delivery and took the
game, 10 to 5. The Chi Gamma Delta
battery was Bonner and Pitts.
Phi Kappa Sigma reached Bailard
for 15 hits and 17 runs in the most
decisive Je'eat of the day, allowing
the Breakers only two tallies. Castle
man yielded three hits, two of which
went to Bailard, the opposing pitcher.
Plenty of errors featured this con
test, many of which were due to the
slippery footing of the Faculty ball
diamond.
Teams wishing to play their games
early in the morning may use the
freshman and varsity diamonds until
these nines close their regular season,
according to the gymnasium office.
Tuesday afternoon will see the fol
lowing teams in action: Phi Kappa
Psi vs. Delta Chi; Alpha Chi Sigma
and Encina Two; the Japanese Club
will play El Toro, El Capitan meets
Kappa Sigma, and Alpha Kappa
Lambda takes on Delta Tau Delta.
Attention is called to the fact by the
intramural managers, that a club must
have seven men on the field at the ap
pointed time, or forfeit the game. A
forfeit counts as a loss in the per
centage column. Catchers' equipment
and umpii'es are furnished, when
necessary, by the gymnasium.
