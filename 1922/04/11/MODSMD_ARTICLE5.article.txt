# Campus Groups Will Be Assigned Concessions in Vanity Fair Tonight
## 
### 
Vanity Fair's concessions and stunts
will be chosen, and assigned to organiza
tions at a meeting of representatives of
all campus groups tonight at 7 o'clock
in the Women's Clubhouse. This time
has been decided on instead of 4 o'clock,
as previously announced, because of the
track meet.
Living groups and campus organiza
tions are requested to choose immedi
ately definite ideas for concessions to be
presented at the Carnival, so that these
may be taken up by the committee at the
session tomorrow. If approved as suit
able, each organization's stunt will be as
signed to it at this time, otherwise some
thing worked out by the Carnival com
mittee will be given. Anything, accord
ing to concessions director "Dick", Tay
lor, with originality, color, speed, and
carrying out the theme of Vanity Fair,
will be welcomed with a cheer.
