# FEDERATION FOR COOPERATION IN BUYING ADOPTED
## Entire Campus to Join Move for Reduced Living Costs; Purchase to Be Supervised 
### 
Eating and living groups on the cam
pus have formed an association to be
known as the Associated Stanford Buy
ers for the purpose of insuring better
prices and service to the members in the
matter of buying any such articles as
they may wish. The pooling method by
which the houses and clubs buy as a
group will make a volume of trade able
to command lower prices and better
service.
The association comprises twenty-two
fraternities, ten sororities, six eating,
clubs, and the bachelors' mess of the
military organization. Approximately
950 Stanford students are taking part in
the buying combine.
The constitution provides that the As
sociated Stanford Buyers shall be ad
ministered by an executive committee
composed of three house managers from
the fraternities, two house managers
from the sororities, two managers of
eating clubs, and an ex-officio member
appointed by the comptroller. The ex
ecutive committee selects a president and
secretary-treasurer. Officers and mem
bers of the committee are as follows:
Ernest H. Moeller, '24, Sigma Xu,
president.
Oma Retterath, '21, Alpha Omicron Pi,
secretary-treasurer.
Mrs. Mabel Foulkes, Kappa Alpha
Theta.
Hudson Proctor, '22. El Catnpo.
Frederick Frederickson, '21, Alpha
Sigma Phi.
Robert Cravens. '23, Zeta Psi.
Warren Kraft, '21. Phi Delta Theta.
Miss Etta Handy, in charge of the new
Union.
The executive committee keeps in con
tact with the fluctuations in market prices
and compares the prices given the asso
ciation with market prices. I lie com
mittee is empowered to give the trade
of the association to any given trader,
dealer, or company. It shall make such
agreements with the traders as shall be
necessary, but it shall never bind the
trade of the association for any definite
time, or guarantee an amount. The ex
ecutive committee also investigates all
grievances.
The constitution stipulates that "in no
case will it be necessary for any one
member to make use of all the trade
agreements established by the associa
tion, but it may make use of one or all
agreements only as members." After a
member has dealt with the official trader
it may not stop its trade without the
consent of the executive committee.
Cessation of trade without such consent
constitutes dismissal from the association
and loss of its benefits.
The history of the organization began
last quarter when H. D. Swett, '20, was
appointed by the Interfraternity Confer
ence to investigate different plans for co
operative buying. The proposed plan was
adopted for purchasing staples through
the new Union. Later a committee was
appointed with Swett as chairman to go
ahead with the proposition. A constitu
tion was drawn up and was adopted at
the end of the term.
