# FEDERATION FOR COOPERATION IN BUYING ADOPTED
## Entire Campus to Join Move for Reduced Living Costs; Purchase to Be Supervised 
### 
Eating and living groups on the cam
pus have formed an association to be
known as the Associated Stanford Buy
ers for the purpose of insuring better
prices and service to the members in the
matter of buying any such articles as
they may wish. The pooling method by
which the houses and clubs buy as a
group will make a volume of trade able
to command lower prices and better
service.
The association comprises twenty-two
fraternities, ten sororities, six eating,
clubs, and the bachelors' mess of the
military organization. Approximately
950 Stanford students are taking part in
the buying combine.
The constitution provides that the As
sociated Stanford Buyers shall be ad
ministered by an executive committee
composed of three house managers from
the fraternities, two house managers
from the sororities, two managers of
eating clubs, and an ex-officio member
appointed by the comptroller. The ex
ecutive committee selects a president and
secretary-treasurer. Officers and mem
bers of the committee are as follows:
Ernest H. Moeller, '24, Sigma Xu,
president.
Oma Retterath, '21, Alpha Omicron Pi,
secretary-treasurer.
Mrs. Mabel Foulkes, Kappa Alpha
Theta.
Hudson Proctor, '22. El Catnpo.
Frederick Frederickson, '21, Alpha
Sigma Phi.
Robert Cravens. '23, Zeta Psi.
Warren Kraft, '21. Phi Delta Theta.
Miss Etta Handy, in charge of the new
Union.
The executive committee keeps in con
tact with the fluctuations in market prices
and compares the prices given the asso
ciation with market prices. I lie com
mittee is empowered to give the trade
of the association to any given trader,
