# BABE DIAMOND NINE PLAYS HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS THIS WEEK
## 
### 
With two games scheduled for this
week, the freshman baseball team is
preparing for the second California
game, Saturday morning. The Lick
Wilmerding High School nine invaded
the campus this afternoon and ChiCo
High School will play the babes to
morrow. If the freshmen play the
same kind of baseball this week that
they displayed in the California game
last Saturday, the high school lads
shoulds prove easy for them.
Coach Kallam has been putting his
men through some stiff work-outs this
week, and the babes will go into Sat
urday's game with a lot of confidence.
The yearlings have the edge on the
series and are doped to win if they
continue to play the same consistent
brand of ball.
The line-up for the second game
with Bruin Cubs has not been an
nounced yet, but it will probably be
the same as that of last Saturday's
game. Either Teague or Foljansbee
are due to pitch with Jim Lawson be
hind the plate. Johnston, Roberts,
Cuddeback and Mulcliay will compose
the infield, with Dick Lawson, Hoff
man, McCandless, Brown and Conner
to chose from in the outer gardens.
