# OPEN-AIR OPERAS IN STADIUM ARE PLANNED
## 
### 
"Stanford's Stadium may be utilized as
an open air auditorium, seating 20,000
people for a grand opera season next
June. The project now is being put
through by Gaetano Merola, who has
had experience as a director of grand
opera not only with the Metropolitan
Grand Opera Company of New York,
but in New York, London, Paris, and
i Milan, as well as in large Araer
| ican cities. He has announced that lie
will secure the best singers from all
parts of the world for his leading roles
and also will present the largest ballet
and chorus ever seen on an operatic
stage. The enterprise will be made to
contribute to the benefit of a number
of Stanford undertakings.
Some time ago Merola approached
the Stanford Board of Athletic Control
with this project and the Board agreed
to his proposal. The contract has not
yet been fully completed and signed,
but doubtless will be, since only one or
two matters of minor detail remain to
be settled.
Stanford from the beginning planned
to have a removable stage constructed,

so that one part of the stadium could be
converted into an open air theater.
This agreement witli Merola has hast
ened the making of that stage. Baker
and Carpenter were some time ago in
structed to secure architect's drawings
and compile estimates of the cost of
making such a stage, but have not yet
reported back to the Board.
The Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol, for its part, will construct the stage
and install conduits and other equip
ment for lighting the stadium outside
and inside for evening performances.
Furthermore, it will provide all the men
to direct the crowds, handle tickets,
and so on , at Mcrola's expense. He
will pay also such items as the cost of
light and for removing the temporary
fixtures employed for bis performances.
By the agreement lie will appropriate
15 per cent of his pross gate receipts
to be divided equally among the Board
of Athletic Control, the Stanford En
dowment Fund, the fund for the en
largement and improvement of the Me
morial Church organ, the Stanford Clin
ics in Sail Francisco, and the Home for
Convalescent Children 011 the campus.
