# TROJAN BOXERS WIN FISTIC TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
University of Southern California
boxers won two of three matches from
the Cardinal pugilists here last night.
The bouts, with one exception, were
not up to the standard set by the Stan
for glove artists early in the season.
The men plainly showed lack of con
dition.
In the 125-pound class, Kenny Shipp
met Farlow. The U. S. C. man was fast '
and had a terrible punch in either mitt. j
The bout was called a draw at the end
of three rounds. In the fourth, both
men were badly winded, when Farlow
landed a right hook to the jaw and!
Shipp hit the canvas. Galloway out- j
classed Jack l'ishburn and won from ;
him easily. Both Fishburn and Shipp .J
lacked condition and were unable to |
stand up under punishment.
Johnnie Lane furnished the only ex
citement of the regular bouts in his
match with Fairbanks. Lane did not j
open up until the second and third j
rounds, but when his blows began to
find their mark the outcome of the bout
was not in question. In the last two
rounds. Lane led all the way and Fair
banks was 'groggy when the final gong
sounded.
Three preliminary bouts preceded the
regular matches. Bill Payne and "Kid"
Freeman boxed a featureless match.
"Husky" Wassum and Covillo mixed
for three rounds in a slow manner.
Wassum plainly outclassed his oppo
nent and did not extend himself to out
point him. Kennedy and Tull, heavy
weights, staged a rough and tumble
match. Both men landed many hard
blows. The third round was especially
fast.
The best part of the evening's enter
tainment was a battle royal between five
freshmen. The boys were willing mix
ers and did not hesitate to land hard
blows when they were able to locate an
opponent. The battle was called a draw
and each freshman drew a dollar for
his share in the program.
Jimmie Britt referced the bouts and
Jack Spalding and Hildebrand acted as
judges.
