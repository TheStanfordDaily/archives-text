# WARNER IN NEED OF HEAVY MEN FOR SPRING FOOTBALL
## Rudiments of Football Being Taught; Knowledge of the Game Is Not Necessary 
### 
"More large men are necessary if
Stanford is to build a winning football
team," said "Pop" Warner in an inter
view last night.
"Stanford men have long desired an
adequate coaching staff, and now that
the Board of Athletic Control has gone
to considerable trouble in providing one
that seems satisfactory, the students
should give it their unqualified support.
"California has so many more stu
dents than Stanford that Thornhill and
I have come to the conclusion, after
being here nearly two weeks and get
ting into intimate touch with football
conditions and football material, that if
Stanford is to cope with her greatest
rival upon equal terms all the available
material must turn out for the team.
We have seen many big husky chaps
around on the campus who are not out
for football and we are convinced that
some of these arc good men who could
help very materially to strengthen Stan
ford on the gridiron.
"Every student should use his or her
influence to get these big fellows out.
Tt doesn't matter whether they have
played football before or not. If any
of these men who are not out think
they will wait until next fall they are
making a big mistake, because now we
have time to teach the rudiments of
the game; next fall the games come so
soon after practice begins that little
time can be given to rudiments. The
important thing, then, is to get the best
men together into a smooth-working
machine as quickly as possible.
"This spring practice will prove of
the greatest value to every candidate
and we can't urge too strongly that all
the big fellows get out. They must get
out if Stanford is to beat California."
