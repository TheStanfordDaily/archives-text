## 
### 
Santa Clara's sluggers went on a ;
spree yesterday afternoon and garner- j
ed twelve hits off the delivery of
Loewenstein and Clark, winning from
the varsity nine by a score of 9 to 5
The Card hatters could get only five
bingles off the delivery of Dunne. Er
rors were made by both sides and
long-distance hits were not infrequent.
The varsity took the lead in the
second inning by scoring a tally on a
base on balls, a single by Green, and i
a sacrifice fly by Peavy. In the third
frame the Cardinal wrecking machine
opened up slightly and gathered two
more markers. Maillot drew a base
on balls and Woodward got a single.
Both men were promptly brought home
when Parker cracked out a triple.
Up to the fifth inning Loewenstein
had allowed only one hit, but in the
fifth the heavy artillery of the enemy
opened concentrated fire and drove in
five runs on six hits. Fawke and
Clancy started the carnival with a
single apiece. Clancy was forced at
second on a fielder's choice, but Fawke
scored on the play. Toso got a single,
but was also out at second on a field
er's choice. With two down and two
men on base, Bedolla celebrated some
body's birthday.by joining the Home-
Itun club, clearing the sacks and add
ing three to the run column. Vukota
got impressed wtih the idea and drove
out a triple, scoring on Manelli''?
single. This ended the scoring for
that canto.
