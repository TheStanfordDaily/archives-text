# NOW IS THE TIME
## 
### 
While the spring sports are keeping - men from the
football practice there are many men on the campus
who are not doing a thing and are, as far as physique
goes, good candidates for the varsity. These men
are missing a chance to make something of them
selves and to do their part for the University.
"Pop" Warner is here for only three weeks more.
He will not be here in the fall. At the present time
he is teaching the men the rudiments of the game.
Thornhill is breaking in men to a new style of line
attack. In the fall the coaches will have to begin at
once with the formation of a team and will not have
the time to put on the rudimentary work of the game
as they are doing now. Without this first knowledge
of the game that is being instilled into the men indi
vidually and collectively now there will not be a team
in the fall that is thoroughly wise to the Warner
style which is to be used.
In the line especially is the place for the inex
perienced man to develop quickly. Thornhill wants
big men there no matter what experience they may
have. ILe can give his time to individual teaching
now in a way that he will not be able to do in the
fall, lie is willing tu put in his time if the men
will give him their time.
I hose of us who are not eligible for the team
can be of inestimable help in edging those on who
have the talent for the jobs. Now is the time to get
them out, because in the fall there will not be any
more than enough time to get a team into shape
before the first of the games which come in the
middle of October. There are only three weeks
more; after the track meet there will only lie two,
and a large number of men from the track squads
will be taking up the time then. Make the effort
this week and it will never be regretted when the
possible new material blossoms forth into good foot
ball players in the fall.
