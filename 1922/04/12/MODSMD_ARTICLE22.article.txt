# THE 						FIVE-POINT CHUCKLE
## 
### 
| No one has spent an afternoon in the track bleach
ers watching the progress of R. L. Templeton and
his gang in their daily workout without marveling
at the way these men are plugging at their game.
We all have heard of this old days of star athletes
developed by faithful and constant work —of under
rated teams getting in position to upset the dope,
if there are any among the track fans of today who
doubt the tales of old, they should lose no time in
getting wise to what Templeton and his present
track squad are up to.
"Dink" can be found at the oval at practically
any time of day. Apparently he lives there, going
from performers in one event to candidates in an
other ; he seems to know the weights and sprints as
well as the jumps in which he himself was a star;
and there is not a man in his outfit who is not im
proving.
We have watched Templeton in this role for two
weeks, lie took over the track-coaching job when
this sjjort was at its lowest ebb, and he devoted
himself no less constantly to it then than now. But
there is this year on the coach's part a new note
which we notice quite frequently as he goes about
directing the men, that is, the "five-point chuckle."
This peculiar outburst emanates quite audibly
from the thorax of Stanford's youngest sport
mentor when Kirksey and Sudden come rambling
down the sprint lanes. It is unmistakable when
J Tart ran ft plays among the scrapiron and when Cap
tain Hanner hauls out his favorite spear. We seem
to hear it distinctly when llowell clears the high

jump bar, and what was formerly a simple purring
has come to he a loud rapping of the ear drums in
the case of Falks' barrier sprinting. Those who
know the coach best claim to have detected signs of
a new five-point chuckle' several weeks ago when
Williamson came 'round the oval in style to litis
liking, and last night it attained almost full develop
ment.
To know the true dope, fans must be as familiar
with the men in the daily workout as in the com
petitive performances, and there is not a Stanford
man in the University who will not have his eyes
glued to the squad in its progress during the next
two weeks.
A short time ago someone mentioned a slump.
This is over as far as track is concerned. Victory
or otherwise on April 22, there will be come-through
performances, shattered dope, and national records
on the part of the Stanford athletes, and later there
will be new American Intercollegiate champions.
The five-point chuckle names one or two as cer
tainties.
All of which reminds us that seats at the rooters'
section for the Big Meet are on sale tomorrow, and
that very few cardboards are now in the hands of
students. These tickets are being handled a> were
those at the P>ig Game, and students who do not
secure them now will be without places at the best
dual meet in three or perhaps ten years. Stanford
must at least be prepared for a great serpentine.

| No one has spent an afternoon in the track bleach
ers watching the progress of R. L. Templeton and
his gang in their daily workout without marveling
at the way these men are plugging at their game.
We all have heard of this old days of star athletes
developed by faithful and constant work —of under
rated teams getting in position to upset the dope,
if there are any among the track fans of today who
doubt the tales of old, they should lose no time in
getting wise to what Templeton and his present
track squad are up to.
"Dink" can be found at the oval at practically
any time of day. Apparently he lives there, going
from performers in one event to candidates in an
other ; he seems to know the weights and sprints as
well as the jumps in which he himself was a star;
and there is not a man in his outfit who is not im
proving.
We have watched Templeton in this role for two
weeks, lie took over the track-coaching job when
this sjjort was at its lowest ebb, and he devoted
himself no less constantly to it then than now. But
there is this year on the coach's part a new note
which we notice quite frequently as he goes about
directing the men, that is, the "five-point chuckle."
This peculiar outburst emanates quite audibly
from the thorax of Stanford's youngest sport
mentor when Kirksey and Sudden come rambling
down the sprint lanes. It is unmistakable when
J Tart ran ft plays among the scrapiron and when Cap
tain Hanner hauls out his favorite spear. We seem
to hear it distinctly when llowell clears the high

jump bar, and what was formerly a simple purring
has come to he a loud rapping of the ear drums in
the case of Falks' barrier sprinting. Those who
know the coach best claim to have detected signs of
a new five-point chuckle' several weeks ago when
Williamson came 'round the oval in style to litis
liking, and last night it attained almost full develop
ment.
To know the true dope, fans must be as familiar
with the men in the daily workout as in the com
petitive performances, and there is not a Stanford
man in the University who will not have his eyes
glued to the squad in its progress during the next
two weeks.
A short time ago someone mentioned a slump.
This is over as far as track is concerned. Victory
or otherwise on April 22, there will be come-through
performances, shattered dope, and national records
on the part of the Stanford athletes, and later there
will be new American Intercollegiate champions.
The five-point chuckle names one or two as cer
tainties.
All of which reminds us that seats at the rooters'
section for the Big Meet are on sale tomorrow, and
that very few cardboards are now in the hands of
students. These tickets are being handled a> were
those at the P>ig Game, and students who do not
