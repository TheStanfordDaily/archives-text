INVESTIGATION DEMANDED
Representatives Woodruff and John
son, two Republican ex-serice men,
jointly offered a resolution in the
House to appoint a tommittee to in
vestigate the liquidation contracts of
Attorney General Daugherty, Secretary
of War, Weeks, Secretary of the Navy,
Denby, and Alien Property Custodian,
Miller. Johnson charged the depart
ment heads with having given valu
able contracts, without dompetitive
bidding, to their friends. Woodruff
was especially bitter in his denuncia
tion of the Attorney General, and
threatened the latter's impeachment
if matters are not cleared up. On the
other hand, Johnson assailed Secretary
Weeks, General Pershing, and Budget
Director Dawes, claiming that the
War Department has wasted millions.
MILITARY HOLIDAY PLANNED
AT GENOA
Tchitcherin of the Russian Delega
tion backed by Lloyd George will at
tempt to put through a program for
land disarmament for a period of
years similar to the ten-year naval
holiday of the Washington Conference.
France and Poland will oppose any
cut in their armies. Poland wishes
to maintain her army because it gives
her the direction of Eastern Europe.
France does not wish Russia to de
mobilize its army of 1,500,000 because
this will give France an excuse to keep
a large army. Germany has but 100,-
000 1 men and it is not necessary for
France to have an army of 1,000,000
on that account. Dr. Rathenau, the
German Foreign Minister, declared
that Germany was "intensely interest
ed in Tchitcherin's demands."
NEW TARIFF BILL REPORTED
The new tariff bill as reported yes
terday by the Finance Committee to
the Senate will afford, on the average,
greater protection than the former
Payne-Aldrich law. Agricultural prod
ucts will be benefited more than any
other group of commodities. The
Senate bill will in general provide
greater protection for American in
dustries. The steel industry will be
benefited by reduction in the proposed
duties on raw materials.
