# STRAWBERRY CANYON FIGHT DEVELOPS INTO LEGAL CONTROVERSY
## 
### 
Opposition to the use of Strawberry
Canyon as the site for the proposed
University of California stadium, was
renewed yesterday at the meeting of
the Board of Regents.
A new angle for attack has been
developed by opponents of ,the Straw
berry Canyon site in which they con
tend that the title to the canyon
passed jointly to the University of
California and the Deaf, Dumb and
Blind Asylum in 1895 for a dam and
reservoir site and cannot now be used
for "inconsistent purposes" such as a
stadium. A letter to this effect has
been sent to individual members of
the board by J. S. Hutchinson of San
Francisco, attorney for the opponents.
Going back into the history of the
property hq declares tT.at the legisla
ture granted land within the proposed
bowl jointly upon the ground that it
was needed as a part of the water
supply of the university and the
asylum. The title of land was given
to the regents but the obligation to
the asylum assumed by the legislative
act still exists and cannot be removed
except by the legislature, he adds.
