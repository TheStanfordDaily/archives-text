# Improvements Being Made In University Gardens
## 
### 
University gardeners were busy today
planting flowers in the shrubbery plots
of the inner quad. Some of the less
sightly trees and shrubs in these plots
were removed and gardens laid out last
week. It is intended that the plants now
being set in will present a mass of color
on University Day, May 20.
Men have been working for several
weeks in Memorial Court spading up the
fifteen-year-old lawn and preparing the
soil for new grass which will be planted
soon. Pines and cedars are being trans
planted from the arboretum and used to
beautify the exterior of the basketball
pavilion.
The old Stanford inn will be moved
in the near future and the kitchen and
sheds torn down. The building will be
located east of Encina gymnasium at the
end of the former football field, and,
after being remodeled, will serve as the
main office of the military department.
At present this department is using the
one-time training quarters, which may be
transported to the polo field to be em
ployed as a clubhouse.
D. H. McQueen has been deputized as
a guard to take charge of the boathouse
at the Lagunita. Part of his work will
be to keep small boys off the lake and to
strictly enforce the university ruling that
only those students who have passed the
swimming examination may go on the
lake. Swimming Coach Brandsten will
announce when these proofs of swim
ming ability may be made.
