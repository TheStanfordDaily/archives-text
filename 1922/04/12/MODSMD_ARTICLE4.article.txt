# North Coast Section Prep Schools Here Saturday in Annual Cinder Path Meet
## 
### 
The annual track meet between prep
schools in the North Coast section will
be held Dii the tSanford Oval this com
ing Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
Twenty-two schools, as compared with
seventeen last year, with a total of 212
athletes, will compete in the meet. The
fight will probably center around the
athletes from San Jose, Berkeley, Hol
lister, Palo Alto, and Alameda.
Palo Alto Union High School has
been successful the past two years in
taking first place in the annual meet,
and indications point to their taking an
other cup this year. San Jose and Berke
ley High will be Palo Alto's most
dangerous opponents, so that the 120-
pound class events, as in past years, may
again be the events on .which the out
come of the meet will center.
Stanford students who are interested
in athletic activities of the neighboring
prep school can gain admission to the
meet on payment of 35 cents.
