"Scarcely any event, historical or oth
erwise, has failed to leave its influence
upon the language of the people. Step
by step and point by point the progress
of these events can be traced in the dic
tionary. Not only may we here trace
the development and change in spelling,
and in meaning, and sense of words, but
we also find the stability brought out of
the main factors underlying our lan
guage."
This was the theme of the lecture
delivered last night by Dr. W. A.
Craigie of Oxford University. His
subject was the Oxford Dictionary, of
which lie is at the present time co
editor.
The stupendous task of compiling
such a work as the Oxford Dictionary
was brought out by the lecturer in trac
ing the development through which it
has passed to its present form.
Before the year 1600 whatever dic
tionaries were compiled were made
with the intention of enabling its users
to learn a foreign language, not with
the purpose of helping them to under
stand their own. Early in the seven
teenth century a new ideal developed
among the dictionary makers, which re
sulted in the gradual development of the
form of lexicon with which \?e are now
familiar.
Jn the middle of the nineteenth cen
tury the English Philological Society
took up the matter of investigating the
deficiencies of our English dictionaries,
and resolutions were passed relative to
undertaking the preparation of a new
work of this nature.
Dr. Craigie explained the method of
collecting material for the completion
of the Oxford Dictionary, and gave a
general estimate of the extent of the
work when finished. The completed
dictionary will include ten volumes,
dealing with the treatment of practic
al! v 400.000 words.
