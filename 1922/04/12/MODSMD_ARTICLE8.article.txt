# VARSITY BEATS U.S.C. IN MEET HERE, 86-40
## Cardinal Entries Take Clean Sweep of Six Events of Fifteen 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
While several hundred track fans sat shivering on the bleachers, the
Cardinal cinder path athletes went through the form of a dual meet with
a nine-man team from the University of 6outhern California. The net re
sult was an 86 to 40 Stanford victory.
As far as quality went, the Trojan delegation was all right, but when it
came to quantity, the southerners were sadly lacking... Schiller and his mates,
among whom was "Cap" Rogers, took three first places, while the Cardinal
performers made clean sweeps in six events. . The relay was not run because
U. S. C. had no entries.
A cold wind, blowing across the track, hampered the efforts of the ath
letes. Schiller roused the bleacherites when he let Williamson lead three
fourths of the way in the 440, and then by a fast finish, beat the Cardinal

flyer to the tape with three yards to
spare. The time was 50 seconds flat.
Schiller beat Williamson again in the
220, finishing second to Sudden.
Wilcox is by no means "through"
in the pole vault. The reliable Art
won the event hadily at 12 feet and
3 inches, and then did 12 feet 6 inches
immediately afterwards in an exhibi
tion jump.
Norman Scofield, another veteran,
staged a comeback. Formerly a quar-
ter miler, he has been devoting his
time to the half this season. Yester
day he beat his team-mates, Daly and
Macintosh in that event in the fast
time of 1:59 minutes.
The performance of Minsky, who
won the broad jump with a leap of 21
feet 8 inches, and of Eddie Meyers,
were also encouraging to Cardinal ad
herents. Meyers made his debut as
a two-miler, stepping the distance in
10 minutes and 13 seconds, which may
or may not assure him of a place in
the Big Meet.
"Rhino" Hartranft had to content
himself with a heave of 49 feet 3
inchps in the shot-put and a second
in the 100-yard dash. To the surprise
of the crowd, he was disqualified in
the discus, and Boyle of U. S. C., won
the event with a toss of 135 feet.
Walt Christie, U. C. track coach,
and "Pesky" Sprott were down to look
over the Cards.
