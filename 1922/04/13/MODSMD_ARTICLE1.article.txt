# CARDINAL PLAYERS PLAN OFFENSIVE IN SECOND U.C. GAME
## Guy Draper Slated for Slab-Duty in Contest Saturday on Blue and Gold Diamond 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
Preparation for the second game
of the "World's Series" between Cali
fornia and Stanford nines is going on
today as Seay's men are working out
a system of attack that will have a
good chance against the Blue and
Gold on Saturday. The game will
be played up at California, and on
that diamond there are likely to hap
pen any kind of upsets in the time
worn dope.
Yesterday afternoon the first team
was sent to bat throughout the prac
tice agaiiißt the send team, which
acted as a defense for the first-string
men to work against. Said defense
was no stonewall, naturally, but the
attackers had an opportunity to prac
tice base-running and hitting that all
goes to help win a ball game. Draper
was out part of the afternoon, but (lid
not stay the whole time.
Most of the local Grantland Rices 011
the campus are figuring that the Car
dinal nine will have a tougher team to
meet this Saturday, compared with
the one they beat last Satuftlay; and
from all indications, such will be the
case. California did not play the
game they are capable of when thev
lost 5-3. The fact that they made six
errors shows this. Everything appear
ed to be in their favor, and defeat was,
to them, far away—until the game got
really started. This Saturday they
will not enter the contest with the
same feeling. They know that they
have a tough proposition to go up
against in the Card line, and they
should be on their toes from the
start.
Guy Draper pitched a remarkable
game of ball last Saturday, but he will
have to go even better than he did
then if he is to win the day after
tomorrow; that is, unless California's
defense cracks open again, or the var
sity sluggers go on a real batting
spree for the first time this season.
If Draper is at his best —and there is
a good chance that he will be —Cali-
fornia will be lucky to get more than
one run. Guy's team-mates should be
able to gather in a couple of tallies,
if not more, by devious means; and
these would be sufficient t6 win.
The line-up will probably be with-
