shal Ed Lamb advises. "You better be

he-man ruckus—fights, Madame Bella
Donna, the city firemen's band —say! the
yelling fur that jew-jitsoo! You don't
know what you're missing. You ladies
is outa luck!"
With the proceeds of the Firemen's
Cabaret, the hire Fighters' Fund com
mittee figures to forcc the fierce flames
to full submission, fitting the fighters so
efficiently that all conflagrations must fail
except those foisted from films. No fires
will hereafter be allowed to occur un
less approved by the Chief two weeks in
advance, at least!
"Don't neglect to remember that after
the colossal and colorful parade, the
stirring assembly, and the glorious, rip
snorting concert by the well and favor
ably known San Francisco Firemen's
Band, equaled by few and surpassed by
none, the stupendous, red-blooded, rois
tering, Firemen's Cabaret is scheduled,"
