# CARD MERMEN SWIM AGAINST BEARS FRIDAY
## 
### 
The Cardinal swimming team is all
set for its annual contest against the
Blue and Gold paddlers which is on
schedule for Friday evening, at S p.m.,
in the Olympic Club tank. Coach
Brandsten's followers have a very
good chance of emerging with a good
point-lead over their ancient rivals
from across the Bay.
With Dud DeGroot performing in
top form it looks as if a new Stanford-
California record will be hung up in
the backstroke event. Charlie Fletch
er, is at present the national junior
champion in the breast stroke race,
and should have little difficulty in tak
ing first place and also making a new
record.
The Cardinal squad is particularly
strong in the plunge for distance with
Hawley going about sixty feet in the
three days he has been out for prac
tice.
