# SONG WRITERS WILL GATHER TOMORROW
## 
### 
Campus song-writers will meet with
Dick Malaby and Chick Midgley of
the junior opera committee at the A. T.
O. house tomorrow afternoon, at 3:30.
The composers are asked to bring
what they consider their best numbers
and to write out a lead-line or melody
which may be used by the committeo.
Malaby and Midgley will attend to the
harmonizing of the songs.
