###

tails of the evening of stag entertainment

The picturesqueness of firemen in uni

the opportunity to aid in a move which
serves the double purpose of saving in
surance costs and providing protection
for campus residents," was promised by

action. Baldy Quintero, '22, has been
slated for a novelty soft-shoe dance and
there will be numbers by Arnold liaylcy,
'23, Richard Malaby, '23, and Les
Seib, '22.
By no means all the entertainment is

crafty Oriental art of self-defense and in
boxing ai*e lined up.
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb will explain in
a brief talk the drawbacks under which
the tire fighters here are now working
