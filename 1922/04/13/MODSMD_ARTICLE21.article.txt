# A 						MEETING OF COLLEGE EDITORS
## 
### 
Representatives from the dailies, weekly papers,
and magazines from most of the colleges west of
the Rockies meet at Stanford next Monday. This
is the second gathering of the Western Intercol
legiate Press Association, and the leaders in jour
nalism from the different universities are meeting
to put the news of the various institutions on a more
standardized basis.
Last year Stanford sent one delegate to Utah,
where the first convention was held. There were
thirty-six members of the Association there and
considerable was done in the way of establishing
news service between the various colleges in the
western states.
Since that time wire services have been instituted
between some of the universities and a regular
service of written news is maintained between the
rest. This year it will be the attempt to put in
wireless between the colleges of the Pacific Coast,
so that immediate results may be had from athletic
contests, forensic meets, and other things of interest
may be sent from one place to another without the
delay incidental to the mail. If this wireless service
can be maintained it will put the dailies of the
colleges in shape to offer a much better and diversi
fied sort of news than is in most of them at the
present.
The Western Intercollegiate Press does not only
have daily papers in its organization, but includes
all sorts of magazines that are published on the many
campuses. It is working in direct conjunction with
the Hammer and Coffin Society, for instance, which
has chapters at several of the Coast colleges, and is
attempting to bring all the representative organs
into close touch with each other for the mutual
benefit of all concerned.
j Â».While these delegates are here they will the
guests for the most part of Sigma Delta Chi and
Press Club, that is, these two organizations will
have the active work in furnishing entertainment
for them and in handling the program of the meet
ings during the three-day conclave. But members
will be quartered at most of the living groups and
will be open at some of the time for being showed
about the campus and to the many points of interest
in and about the University.
On Tuesday afternoon it is arranged to take
these delegates on a short ride into the La Honda
hills and give them a view of some of the beautiful
country about the University. Autos are needed
for this and it will be much appreciated if the use of
some machines can be gotten for a couple of hours
between 2 and 4. Carl Shoup, '24, is in charge of
the afternoon's ride. You will be helping the jour
nalistic part of University activity very much if
you will give the use of your machine for this time
to taking these men around. This is not for the
staff of any of the campus periodicals, but is an
inter-university proposition and these men are here,
some of them from a distance of 800 miles, to
transact real business.
If we show them as good a time as was extended
to our delegate last year in Utah, they will pack off
a very satisfactory idea of the University. Presi
dent and Mrs. Wilbur have extended the courtesy
of their house for Tuesday evening and the rest of
the time will be taken care of, with the one excep
tion of the auto ride. I hat is the only time that is,
asked from members of the student body as a whole.
