Henry Mack, In Friday Caboose

Herewith we take shovel in hand to keep a few weeds
out of the patch until Friday can get back on the job.
These are guaranteed to be dyed-in-thelwool, 100 proof
Cabbages, and any insinuations that they are cold
storage Cabbages is hotly denied. It's a long row to the
bottom of the column, but here goes.

Artist—Somehow, this picture seems to lack something
Cynic—How about a few clothes?

If the bird with the hair-tonic tenor coesn't quit
twanging his vocal chords in M.E. 12 when this particu
lar Cabbagist is attempting to draw a steam pump, he
is going to be running around looking for some way
to get a T-square out of his eye.

The band leader states that the next time each and
every saxophone in the band is found equipped with a
deceased mouse, things are going to go hard with some
body.

We have received a communication denying with in
dignation the report that the assemblage arose as one
man at the recent banquet in honor of Marshal Joffre,
when the band struck up "Madelon."

We don't want to get personal or anything, but we
venture to opine that "Tiny" Hartranft is never going to
be outclassed in any domestic plate trowing duel.

If the language of the headlines is a true criterion
of the evolution of "Americanese," as has been alleged,
why shouldn't the University Schedule real like this:
Oct. 1. —Registrar Swamps Card Babes, 96-0.
April 7 —Somb-Pillars Cop Sheey Grief-Ticket.
Junel2 —Mentors-Studes In Quarterly Skull Classic.

Speaking of appropriate names, Sudden has a rival—
this bird Aydelott who pitches for the frosh.

"I just know those California hoys are crooks," re
marked Ambrosia. "Did you see in the papers that
Walter Christie doped his track team to win? Fancy
filling innocent college boys full of morphine or cocaine
or some horrid drug just to win a track meet."

A thoughtful chap may obtain really startling effects
by merely taking certain parts of current advertising
matter in some of the rather more exclusive periodicals,
cutting them out in appropriate poses and securing
them to the wainscoting either in the conventional
border design, or'in the rather more dashing rosette
figure. These, when added to by a sprinkling of La Vie
to give the rather more necessary verve, will prove a
constant source of fascination to the rather more ro
mantically inclined of your acquaintances, and will
make the apartment a gathering for all sorts of gay
little parties. Rather more than anything else, the
appropriate placement of placards, as for example "You
Dive at Your Own Risk over the window paneling, is in
strong favor, and denotes that you have a broad, even
a thick sense of humor, which is coming into vogue
this season rather more.
One must be careful never to let the perfectly ap
pointed salon be opened without preparing a festoon
of some quaint article, half inch cigar butts being pre
ferred. This festive quad may be placed in any manner
with regard to-the decorations, just so it is enabled to
give the quaintly hospitable welcome to the stranger,
removing his hat for him at a clean sweep.
With these details completed, nothing remains but
to fill up the compartment with antique perniture, leav
ing, of course, the proper spacing of approximately 3
15-100 inches and you have the little home complete,
with plenty of room left on the window ledge for sleep
ing and dressing.

"Ready for Easter in Every Section of This Great
Store," reads an advertisement in a San Francisco paper.
Including, doubtless, the Christmas tree department.

No, Heloise, a man that is too small to run the mile
isn't called a half-miler.

HOW'S THIS FOR A LAST LINE.
