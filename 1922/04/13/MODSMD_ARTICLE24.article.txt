# RESIGNATION AND PROMOTIONS
## 
### 
Charles Prior, desk editor, has resigned from the
Daily. Too much work on the outside forces Prior
to give up his position. The Daily is sorry to lose
him, as he was one of the most conscientious work
ers on the staff. Philip Newill, '24, and Carl Shoup,
'24, go on the desk force today. Both men have
served nearly two years on the staff and are ex
perienced in work on the copy desk. One or the
other has headed the staff for the last six months,
so both rate the advancement as a matter of seniority
in work done.
