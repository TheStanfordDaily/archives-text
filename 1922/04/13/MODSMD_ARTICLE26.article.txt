The Daily Palo Alto:
Not knowing whom to address this
plea directly, 1 am referring it to the
D. P. A. for its publication, trusting it
will reach the attention of the right per
sons and that it may receive some con
sideration.
My plea is that a room be reserved, or
that space be given in the lobby of the
new Stanford Union for the cups and
other trophies won by Stanford. At
present, about the only trophies the stu
dents get to see are the few cups left
in the reading room of the Men's Union.
These, apparently, have never been
looked after, some are tarnished, and all
of them are literally hidden from public
view.
It seems to me that it is almost an in
justice to the students who have worked
and fought for them that these be hidden
or stored away as soon as they are won.
Probably this is met Â°ly an oversight
by the perosns in charge, or else from
lack of a suitable place, but now that the
new Union is to be open to the student
body as a whole and to the public in
general, it appears to me that it would
be an ideal place for them until a real
trophy room may be secured.
Yours for Stanford,
P. S., '23.
out change. The team worked well as
a whole against California, and the
fact that not an error was made
showed that every man was up 011 his
toes and fighting. Green will catch,
with Woodward, Peavy, Maillott and
Heckendorf the best choices for the in
field. Mitchell, Wayland, Parker and
Carver are the best outfielders on
tap.
If the varsity cinches the series
with a win over California Saturday,
it will be because fight has conquered
odds; but the fact that it has been
done already paves the way for a good
chance again.
