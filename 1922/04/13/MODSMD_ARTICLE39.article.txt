### 
The eighth annual track and field meet
of the high schools in the north coast
section of the California Interscholastic
.Federation will be held Saturday after
noon in the Stanford Oval at 2:30. The
north coast section is composed of fifteen
counties of northern California, includ
ing some fifty high schools from Eureka
on the north to Monterey on the south.
In last year's meet Palo Alto Union
High School took first honors for the
third successive year, winning with a
total count of 42 points. Hollister placed
second with 35, Berkeley third with 32,
Alameda fourth with 28, and San Jose
fifth. San Jose and Berkeley High
Schools have entered the largest teams
against Palo Alto this year and will offer
some stiff competition. The events in
the 120-pound class, as in past meets,
"promise again to be the events on which
the outcome of the meet will center.
Many of the point winners in last
year's meet have again entered this year.
Two hundred and thirty athletes from
twenty-two schools will compete. .Such
a large number will make it necessary to
run off the heats in the 100-yard dash
and the quarter mile Saturday morning
at 11 o'clock. From twenty-live to forty
athletes are entered in every race, so it
will be necessary to assign the men
lanes ip all heats and races except the
finals.
The time schedule allows eight min
utes for each event. The 880, 8- and 12-
pound shots, discus throw, pole vault,
and high jump will start at 2:30, with
the broad jump and javelin throw at
3 :30.
