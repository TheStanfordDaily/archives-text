WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE,
Pullman, Wash., April 12. (P. I. N. S.)
â€”Women students of the State Col
lege of Washington have voted down
a proposal to don rooter caps like
those of the men, an overwhelming
vote following the opinion stated by
one young woman that it would not
be possible to enforce a ruling to wear
caps. At least, she said, it would be
beneath the dignity of the young wom
en to do so. The men enforce their
ruling by a vigilance committee arm
ed with wooden paddles.
