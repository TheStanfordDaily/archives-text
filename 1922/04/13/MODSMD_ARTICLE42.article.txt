ANOTHER AGREEMENT IN
IRELAND
A meeting between deValera and
Griffiths, in which a compromise is
to be negotiated which will put an end
to civil strife between Republican and
Free State factions, is reported today.
It is said that the compromise will in
volve postponement of the elections
till fall, the revision of the registra
tion lists, and may possibly place de-
Valera once again in his old position
as president of the Dail. This is the
price the new government may have
to pay for an opportunity to restore
peace. The difficulty that will con
front the new government regardless
of the success of the new agreement
has been made apparent in the
failure of practically every agreement
negotiated in Ireland to hold the sup
port of those in whose name it was
negotiated. The treaty with England,
the two agreements with the Northern
Government, the truce patched up be
tween the two factions in southern
Ireland have all suffered the same
fate —they have been denounced and
broken by an intransigeant minority
which does not know what com
promise means.
THE RECOGNITION OF RUSSIA
Russia has been handed the terms
upon which the Powers of Western
Europe will grant her recognition.
These terms involve a recognition of
all the debts contracted by previous
governments, a recognition of debts
due the nationals of foreign countries
in Russia, guarantees that foreign
capital entering Russia will be pro
tected, and provision that foreigners
in Russia will receive justice in the
Russian courts. The amount of the
debts due to governments and indi
viduals would be fixed by a Commis
sion. Russia would also have to give
compensation for losses which were
caused by acts of the Revolutionary
Government. Tchicherin has asked
for more time in which to study the
proposals, and has intimated that the
Western Powers can afford to make
better terms than have been offered.
Meanwhile an effort is being made to
create the impression that the bad
boy of the Conference is to be neither
Russia nor Germany, but France.
FRANCE TO GENOA
France refuses to consider the limi
tation of armament on the ground that
the Genoa Conference is "economic
and not political," whereas America
refused to participate in the confer
ence because we were afraid it would
be "political rather than economic,''
and one of the reason for our believing
that it could not be a successful eco
nomic conference was that it had
stricken the limilation of armaments
from its agenda. So the Devil quotes
Scripture. The Conference would cer
tainly find no easy sailing if it under
took to limit the size of armies
throughout Europe; French opposition
would not be the only thing in the
way. However, it is probable that
those who brought up the subject of
land armament did not expect to do
anything more with it than to em
brace France and put her 011 the de
fensive. Doubtless further attempts
will be made to bring the question of
Reparations before the Conference, and
these attempts will also be blocked by
France. It is very significant, how
ever,,that 011 question of such funda
mental importance France can so easi
ly be placed in a position of diplomatic
isolation. The situation emphasizes
the fact that French interests, unlike
British interests, do not coincide with
the interests of most of France's neigh
bors. For England the primary ob
ject is the economic recovery of
Europe—reparations and guarantees
can be sacrificed to recover lost mark
ets and revive British industry. But
France, which is more nearly self
supporting economically, does not suf
fer so much from the lack of European
markets, and would suffer infinitely
more from the loss of reperations and
the sacrifice of guarantees. So Genoa
presents a spectacle which can give
Frenchman 110 pleasure—the alliances
of three years ago are 011 their way
to the discard; England and France
are locking horns in a diplomatic
battle, Germany stands by to profit
from the quarrel of her erstwhile
enemies.

fate —they have been denounced and
broken by an intransigeant minority
which does not know what com
promise means.
THE RECOGNITION OF RUSSIA
Russia has been handed the terms
upon which the Powers of Western
Europe will grant her recognition.
These terms involve a recognition of
all the debts contracted by previous
governments, a recognition of debts
due the nationals of foreign countries
in Russia, guarantees that foreign
capital entering Russia will be pro
tected, and provision that foreigners
in Russia will receive justice in the
Russian courts. The amount of the
debts due to governments and indi
viduals would be fixed by a Commis
sion. Russia would also have to give
compensation for losses which were
caused by acts of the Revolutionary
Government. Tchicherin has asked
for more time in which to study the
proposals, and has intimated that the
Western Powers can afford to make
better terms than have been offered.
Meanwhile an effort is being made to
create the impression that the bad
boy of the Conference is to be neither
Russia nor Germany, but France.
FRANCE TO GENOA
France refuses to consider the limi
tation of armament on the ground that
the Genoa Conference is "economic
and not political," whereas America
refused to participate in the confer
ence because we were afraid it would
be "political rather than economic,''
and one of the reason for our believing
that it could not be a successful eco
nomic conference was that it had
stricken the limilation of armaments
from its agenda. So the Devil quotes
Scripture. The Conference would cer
tainly find no easy sailing if it under
took to limit the size of armies
throughout Europe; French opposition
would not be the only thing in the
way. However, it is probable that
those who brought up the subject of
land armament did not expect to do
anything more with it than to em
brace France and put her 011 the de
fensive. Doubtless further attempts
will be made to bring the question of
Reparations before the Conference, and
these attempts will also be blocked by
France. It is very significant, how
ever,,that 011 question of such funda
mental importance France can so easi
ly be placed in a position of diplomatic
isolation. The situation emphasizes
the fact that French interests, unlike
British interests, do not coincide with
the interests of most of France's neigh
bors. For England the primary ob
ject is the economic recovery of
Europe—reparations and guarantees
can be sacrificed to recover lost mark
ets and revive British industry. But
France, which is more nearly self
supporting economically, does not suf
fer so much from the lack of European
markets, and would suffer infinitely
more from the loss of reperations and
the sacrifice of guarantees. So Genoa
presents a spectacle which can give
Frenchman 110 pleasure—the alliances
of three years ago are 011 their way
to the discard; England and France
are locking horns in a diplomatic
battle, Germany stands by to profit
from the quarrel of her erstwhile
enemies.
ANOTHER AGREEMENT IN
IRELAND
A meeting between deValera and
Griffiths, in which a compromise is
to be negotiated which will put an end
to civil strife between Republican and
Free State factions, is reported today.
It is said that the compromise will in
volve postponement of the elections
till fall, the revision of the registra
tion lists, and may possibly place de-
Valera once again in his old position
as president of the Dail. This is the
price the new government may have
to pay for an opportunity to restore
peace. The difficulty that will con
front the new government regardless
of the success of the new agreement
has been made apparent in the
failure of practically every agreement
negotiated in Ireland to hold the sup
port of those in whose name it was
negotiated. The treaty with England,
the two agreements with the Northern
Government, the truce patched up be
tween the two factions in southern
Ireland have all suffered the same
fate —they have been denounced and
broken by an intransigeant minority
which does not know what com
