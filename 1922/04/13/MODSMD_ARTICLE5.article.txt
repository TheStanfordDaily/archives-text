# BABE DIAMOND NINE WINS RAGGED GAME
## 
### 
Playing the most ragged game of the
season, the freshman nine won an un
deserved victory from Lick Wilmerding
High School last night by a score of 8-7.
Overconfidence and numerous errors on
the part of the babes, coupled with timely
hitting by the high school lads, almost
lost the game for Coach Kallam's team.
The babes scored in the second and
third innings and led 2-0 when the high
school lads went to bat in the first of the
fourth. Follansbee wobbled badly in this
inning with two down and allowed three
successive singles. The freshman in
field made three costly errors at this
point and three runs crossed the plate.
The yearlings wiped out the lead in the
fifth with four runs on two hits and as
many errors on the part of the high
school infield.
No further scoring occurred until the
ninth, when Lick Wilmerding scored
four runs on three hits, a walk, a hit
batsman, a sacrifice hit. and an error.
In their half of the ninth, the freshmen
played baseball for the first time in the
game. Cuddeback beat out a bunt and
scored on McCandless' double. McCand
less stole third and scored on Roberts'
bunt.
With the second California game
scheduled for Saturday morning, the
Cardinal babes will have to do a great
deal of work if they hope to win the
necessary victory. The infield is not
working as it should and the heavy hit
ters are not coming through in the
pinches. Follansbee had his worst game
of the year yesterday.
The babes meet Cliico High School
this afternoon in their last game before
the battle with Coach Price's men Satur
day.
