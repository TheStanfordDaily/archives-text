# APPLICATIONS FOR SUMMER CAMPS MAY NOW BE HANDED IN
## 
### 
Major Leroy P. Collins of the Military
department is now receiving applications
for enrollment in the Citizens' Army
Training Camps which are to be held
this "summer at the Presidio at San
Francisco and various other points. The
aim of the three courses of instruction
provided at these camps is to fit the
citizen at large to Serve as a reserve
army officer, and to provide a means
whereby those R. O. T. C. men who have
not had the opportunity to complete their
courses at college may still secure-their
commissions.
Practically every branch of the service
will be represented in the camp at the
Presidio. The course is graded and ex
tends over three summers.
Those interested should communicate
at once with Major Collins, as enrollment
in some of the courses is limited.
