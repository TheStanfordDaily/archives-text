to also exercise control and be a help to the magazines and all periodicals
published.
At the first convention, at Utah, Warrep Lewis, '21, editor of the Cardinal
and business manager of the Chaparral was the Stanford delegate. He
brought back many good ideas on the consolidation of the fields covered by

the several publications that exist on
the campus, and especially the matter
of getting together on the advertising
where as at Stanford there is a small
advertising field to draw from.
The three-day program of the con
vention while here, will be chiefly
made up of business sessions in the
mornings and afternoons of each day.
Speakers from the San Francisco
papers will address the convention on
the various phases of newspaper work.
Some of the Stanford faculty will
speak from the historical standpoint
where they have gotten a first-hand
knowledge of journalistic work in the
foreign countries during the last few
years.
Talks by the delegates on the prob
lems that confront the average uni
versity paper and magazine will occu
py most of the rest, of the time in
business sessions. As a part of the
entertainment there will be a banquet
011 Monday night to which the mem
bers of the campus publications will
be invited. The speaker of the even
ing has not yet been announced. Tues
day afternoon and evening will be
given up to a ride around the hills
near Stanford and a dance given by

ing in honor of the delegates.

several associations doing much the same work through the western terri
tory but all of them were limited to the news exchange in newspaper work.
The purpose of the Western Inter-collegiate Press Association is not to only
take in the newspapers of the various member colleges and universities but
to also exercise control and be a help to the magazines and all periodicals
published.
At the first convention, at Utah, Warrep Lewis, '21, editor of the Cardinal
and business manager of the Chaparral was the Stanford delegate. He
brought back many good ideas on the consolidation of the fields covered by

the several publications that exist on
the campus, and especially the matter
of getting together on the advertising
where as at Stanford there is a small
advertising field to draw from.
The three-day program of the con
vention while here, will be chiefly
made up of business sessions in the
mornings and afternoons of each day.
Speakers from the San Francisco
papers will address the convention on
the various phases of newspaper work.
Some of the Stanford faculty will
speak from the historical standpoint
where they have gotten a first-hand
knowledge of journalistic work in the
foreign countries during the last few
years.
Talks by the delegates on the prob
lems that confront the average uni
versity paper and magazine will occu
py most of the rest, of the time in
business sessions. As a part of the
entertainment there will be a banquet
011 Monday night to which the mem
bers of the campus publications will
be invited. The speaker of the even
ing has not yet been announced. Tues
day afternoon and evening will be
given up to a ride around the hills
near Stanford and a dance given by
President and Mrs. Wilbur in the even
ing in honor of the delegates.
