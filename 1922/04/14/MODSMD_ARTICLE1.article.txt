# VARSITY NINE TO MEET CALIFORNIA IN SECOND GAME
## Stanford Due For Hard Fight, But Has Good Chance to Sew Up Series With Bears 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
Who will win the second game of
the baseball series tomorrow after
noon,' when Stanford and California
tangle on the Berkeley field? That
is the question being asked all over
the campus since the recent revival
of interest in the sport following the
upset of the statistics hounds last
Saturday.
Prediqtions that are worth their
weight in ink are rare; but it seems
safe to say that tomorrow's game will
be a close, hotly contested battle, with
neither team running away with a
large score. The field up at Berkeley
is conducive to misplays, but both
nines are keyed up to a point where
careless errors will not be allowed
on the program. Granted a fair share
of the breaks, the Cardinal varsity
can be rated an even-money bet to
win. Those who want a sure thing,
however, had better put their coin out
at 4 per cent interest.
The Stanford line-up will be sub
stantially the same as was used last
Saturday. Draper and Green will, of
course, form the battery. Woodward
on first, Peavy on second, Maillot on
short, and Heckendorff at third, loom
up as the infield that will start. Seay
has four men to pick from in the outer
pastures. Parker, Wayland, Mitchell
and Carver are all on deck, and any
three of these may be chosen.
Draper will have to work his best
against California tomorrow,-but from
the way he has been going, there i3
nothing to fear 011 that account. He
has absolute control over the ball, and
this, with his past experience and his
valuable knack of using his head, tends
to give him the edge over batters he
has met before. California has the
reputation of having a heavy slugging
team, but they have yet to show it
against Draper.
The Cardinal attack is the big ques
tion mark in the problem. If Captain
Green and his men open up full blast
with a flock of hits, a Stanford win
should be a certainty. So far this sea
son the Cardinal hitters have not
shown a concentrated attack, but from
the way batting practice went yes
terday afternoon, they are due to find
their batting eyes. The general feel
ing is that most of them are overdue,
and are likely to knock the California
hurlers for a row of tastefully deco
rated fire hydrants.
The Blue and Gold will be a different
team from what they were last Satur
day. At least, they should be. They
entered the first game with the feeling
that they could not very well lose,
especially on the record of past per
formances. Their playing in the in
field was often careless, and not un
til toward the end of the game did
they tighten up. They know now
that they have a formidable opponent
facing them tomorrow, and they are
due to take no chances.
