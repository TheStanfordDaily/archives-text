# CARDINAL TRACK VARSITY STARTS FINAL WORKOUT
## Howell Well Again Following Influenza Attack; Former Distance Star is Visitor 
### 
All intensive training for the Cali
fornia meet 011 April 22, except in one
or two cases, will be halted, Monday,
and from then until Saturday the var
sity cinder-path athletes will occupy
themselves on the track just enough
to keep 011 edge.
Coach "Dink" Templeton has al
ready ordered some of his men, par
ticularly those in the jumps and the
quarter mile, to begin to taper off
their work. Meyers, Elliott, French,
Eddleman, and Rousselot in the dist
ance runs are still after power and
endurance, will work up till Monday.
Templeton's main concern now is to
keep his candidates in top condition
for the Big Meet, and to prevent any
injuries or last-minute casualties. Most
of the men are in good condition, says
Dad Moulton, veteran trainer, and
Howell is the only real invalid. The
high jumper is reported to be almost
well, however, and will probably re
turn to the campus this week-end.
How much jumping he will be able
to do next week is problematical.
Outside of Howell, there is little to
worry Templeton as far as the condi
tion of his athletes goes, uene Davis'
"charley-horse" is almost well, and
Orlo Hayes returned to work last
nignt after a lay-off of almost a week
011 account of an injured leg. Eddlf
man is gradually recovering from the
effects of a pulled tendon, and is
slated to enter the two-mile.
Morris Kirksey, the veteran Cardi
nal sprinter, who can lead any man
to the tape except Paddock, has been
doing light training. Kirksey, although
he has been having some trouble with
one of his legs, and is at disadvantage
in that the California affair will be his
first regular meet this year, is con
ceded fir-it in both the 1)0 and 220 by
the majority of fans.
From remarks dropped by Walter
Christie at the Stanford-U. S. C. meet
Tuesday, the California mentor thinks
little of the Cardinal's changes in the
big event. After watching Temple
ton's charges to their stuff against
the Trojans, Christie opined that Cali
fornia would win rather easiiy. He
also added that "Brick' Muller would
be ready to do "some" jumping next
Saturday.
A tall, well-built man dropped in at
the training house Wednesday after
noon He was L. L. Chapman, '18,
who came as near to being an "iron
man" on the track as any Stanford
man ever did. In the 1918 classic
Chapman, who was captain, opened by
winning the mile handy. Some min
utes later he entered the two-mile,
and broke the tape in that event also.
After his three miles, he went into
the 880 and set such a fast pace that
the Bruin entries wore themselves out
chasing him, and that his team-mate
won on the finish.
Chapman, although he had not done
any work on the track for four years,
donned the spikes, and was L.soon seen
circling the oval. He led Templeton's
milers around and then took on the
two-milers for a few laps' jaunt.
