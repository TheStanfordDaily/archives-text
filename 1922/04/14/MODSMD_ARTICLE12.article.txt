# CARDINAL SWIMMERS WILL MEET CALIFORNIA TONIGHT
## 
### 
Coach Ernie Brandsten will send his
aquatic team against the Blue and Gold
swimmers this evening at 8 o'clock in the
Olympic Club tank in San Erancisco.
With both teams composed of some of
the best swimmers that have ever rep
resented any college on the Pacific Coast,
the spectators will more than likely see
several records changed. The prelim
inary dope of the meet, however, seems
to favor the Cardinals.
The meet will find Stanford particu
larly strong in four events and a good
chance of making points in the three
other events and the relay. In the div
ing, White, who last week won the
national diving championship when he
defeated Clarence Pinkston. former
national diving champion and at present
world's champion, will have a little dif
ficulty in capturing first place. Last
Wednesday lie again defeated Pinkston
in the final meet with the Olympic Club.
Sneddon will also be entered in this
contest and should add three points to
the Cardinal's score.
Charlie Fletcher and Kraemer, wear
ing the Stanford colors in the breast
stroke event, should take first and sec
| ond places. Fletcher is at present na
tional junior breast stroke champion
and is considered out of the most
promising swimmers in the country in
this race'. Kraemer has been showing
up well in practice races.
Captain Austin will compete in the
100 and 220-yard free style races and

will have to meet California's best men
in these contests. California is consid
ered strong in the sprints, but the Car
dinar skipper lias been making good
time in practice 'and he will more than
likely win at least one of the events.
Hi Wooster, present P. A. A. junior
220-yard free style champion, has been
one of the finds of the local swimming
season and can be counted upoji to win
his share of the honors.
In the 50-yard event, Miller and A1
Hooper will compete for Stanford.
Miller has been making fast time all
season, while Hooper was the sprint
star of last year's freshman team. In
Dud DeGroot, Coach Brandsten has one
of the fastest backstroke swimmers on
the Pacific Coast. DeGroot was a star
performer in high school and made an
excellent record here in his freshman
year. Fletcher will also enter this event.
llawley has been making over seventy
feet consistantly in the plunge for dis
tance and it is doubtful if California
has a man that can come anywhere near
his mark. Coach Brandsten discovered
this plunging star at the beginning of
this season. Dick Fullcrton tried his
skill in this event a few days ago and
found that lie was able to make about
sixty-five feet, which should earn him a
second place. The relay team will be
chosen from Austin, Hooper, Miller,
Overacher, and Dickey. Owing to the
size of the pool, each team will be al
lowed to enter only two men in each
I event.

skill in this event a few days ago and
found that lie was able to make about
sixty-five feet, which should earn him a
second place. The relay team will be
chosen from Austin, Hooper, Miller,
Overacher, and Dickey. Owing to the
size of the pool, each team will be al
lowed to enter only two men in each
I event.
Coach Ernie Brandsten will send his
aquatic team against the Blue and Gold
swimmers this evening at 8 o'clock in the
Olympic Club tank in San Erancisco.
With both teams composed of some of
the best swimmers that have ever rep
resented any college on the Pacific Coast,
the spectators will more than likely see
several records changed. The prelim
inary dope of the meet, however, seems
to favor the Cardinals.
The meet will find Stanford particu
larly strong in four events and a good
chance of making points in the three
other events and the relay. In the div
ing, White, who last week won the
national diving championship when he
defeated Clarence Pinkston. former
national diving champion and at present
world's champion, will have a little dif
ficulty in capturing first place. Last
Wednesday lie again defeated Pinkston
in the final meet with the Olympic Club.
Sneddon will also be entered in this
contest and should add three points to
the Cardinal's score.
Charlie Fletcher and Kraemer, wear
ing the Stanford colors in the breast
stroke event, should take first and sec
| ond places. Fletcher is at present na
tional junior breast stroke champion
and is considered out of the most
promising swimmers in the country in
this race'. Kraemer has been showing
up well in practice races.
Captain Austin will compete in the
100 and 220-yard free style races and

will have to meet California's best men
in these contests. California is consid
ered strong in the sprints, but the Car
dinar skipper lias been making good
time in practice 'and he will more than
likely win at least one of the events.
Hi Wooster, present P. A. A. junior
220-yard free style champion, has been
one of the finds of the local swimming
season and can be counted upoji to win
his share of the honors.
In the 50-yard event, Miller and A1
Hooper will compete for Stanford.
Miller has been making fast time all
season, while Hooper was the sprint
star of last year's freshman team. In
Dud DeGroot, Coach Brandsten has one
of the fastest backstroke swimmers on
the Pacific Coast. DeGroot was a star
performer in high school and made an
excellent record here in his freshman
year. Fletcher will also enter this event.
llawley has been making over seventy
feet consistantly in the plunge for dis
tance and it is doubtful if California
has a man that can come anywhere near
his mark. Coach Brandsten discovered
this plunging star at the beginning of
this season. Dick Fullcrton tried his
skill in this event a few days ago and
found that lie was able to make about
sixty-five feet, which should earn him a
second place. The relay team will be
chosen from Austin, Hooper, Miller,
Overacher, and Dickey. Owing to the
