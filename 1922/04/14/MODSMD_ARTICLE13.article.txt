# Court Favorites Will Do Battle For Sceptre of Resplendent Realm

All was dark. The velvet canopy of
night was black and fuzzy. In the
arched vault of sky, the stars twinkled
down without much success.
Suddenly a beam of light shot across
the enclosure, and fell upon a glamor
ous scene. Upon a glittering pedestal
sat two noble figures, epitomizing the
beauty and strength of a close race. A
circlet of refulgent gems flashed lire
from their splendid brows. It was the
king and queen.
"What I10!" cried the kind. Where
upon forty knights and forty nobles
were slaughtered in the rush for garden
tools. For the king's word was law
in those days.
"1 say," said the queen â€” but you
know the rest.
Once again the gallant knights and
lovely ladies see bitter jousts for their
favorites. For the 1922 Carnival's king
and queen contest is to start next week,
and a host of candidates, backed by
powerful organizations to rule the realm
of Vanity Fair, have announced their
intention of going out for the night.
