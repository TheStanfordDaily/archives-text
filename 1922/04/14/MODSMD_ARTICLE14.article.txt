# BABE NINE DEFEATS CHICO HIGH SCHOOL
## Cardinal Yearlings Will Meet Bruin Cubs in Second Game of Ball Series Tomorrow 
### 
Coach Kallam's freshman nine showed
a reversal of form yesterday and de
feated Chico High School by a score of
7-1 in a well played game. But two
errors were chalked up against the
babes and they made most of their
eleven hits count for runs.
Hoffman, pitching for the yearlings,
proved a complete mystery to the high
school lads, allowing but three hits and
striking out ten men. Yesterday's game
was the tirst Hoffman has pitched this
year, but he looks like a comer. In ad
dition to his pitching performance, he
got a triple and scored two runs. Rob
erts, with two singles in as many times
at bat. was the heaviest hitter of the
day. lie also scored two runs and stole
as many bases.
Tomorrow at 10 o'clock the yearlings
will tangle with Nibs Price's Bryin cubs
in the second game of the series. Last
Saturday the Cardinal freshmen won
from the Blue and Gold yearlings by a
score of 6-0, and if they play the same
kind of ball tomorrow as they did
against Chico High School yesterday,
they should have an even break with
their rivals across the bay.
The Card babes may enter the fray
tomorrow with a somewhat crippled
line-up. Jim Lawson injured his weak
leg in the Lick Wilmerding game
Wednesday and may not be in shape
for the game. Lawson is a bulwark of
strength behind the plate and is a strong
hitter. Johnston is fully capable of till
ing Lawson's shoes, but he would be
missed at first. McDonald can hold
down the position at tirst, but he is a
weak hitter. The infield is working bet
ter and the hitters seem to have recov
ered their batting eyes. Mulchay came
out of a bad slump in yesterday's game
and registered two times in the hit col
umn in four trips to the plate. Guide-
back and McCandless have bAtli been
hitting the ball harder this week. Dick
Lawson has completely recovered from
an injury to his back and he adds a
! great deal to the morale of the team.
Kallam has not announced his choice
for mound duty in the game tomorrow
yet. Follansbee will probably get the
call if he is in good form. The little
fellow pitches excellent ball when he
has a good day, but on his off days he
proves easy for opposing basemen.
Teague and Aydellotte pitched good
ball against the California freshmen
last Saturday. Kellam may start
the big left-hander, however, as he has
had a good rest since last Saturday.
The Cardinal yearlings rested this after
noon and will travel to Berkeley tomor
row morning.
