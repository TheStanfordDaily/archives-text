# Law May Decide Fight Over California Stadium
## 
### 
The tight against the Strawberry
Canyon site chosen by the regents of the
University of California for the proposed
stadium, will be carried to Attorney
General Webb, if necessary, according to
J. S. Hutchinson, lawyer, A new light
has been cast on the controversy as a
result of the filing of a document by
Hutchinson which holds that the con
struction of a stadium in Strawberry
Canyon would be a distinct violation of
the terms under which the land was
originally secured.
The only thing done at the meeting of
the state university regents last Tues
day was to receive the plans drawn up
by the university architect, John Galen
Howard. Hutchinson's document was
not received in time for consideration, so
will probably be discussed at the next
meeting.
