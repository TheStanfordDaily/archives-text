# STANFORD TENNIS SQUAD WILL MEET BEARS AT BERKELEY
## Cardinal Players Have Slight Edge Over Blue and Gold Opponents in Annual Meet 
### 
Stanford will have a slight advantage
in experience over California in the an
nual dual tennis tournament held on
the Berkeley courts tomorrow. Ncer
a'nd Davies are playing their third sea
son on the Cardinal varsity, while the
Blue and Gold team was weakened this
year by the loss of Levy, Weinstein,
and Casey. At the present, Captain
Wallace Bates is the only veteran on
the Bruin squad.
Captain Phil Neer or Jimmy Davies
will play the first singles match of the
tourney, meeting Bates. Both players
won from Bates last summer, Davies
defeating him in the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet, while Neer won from
him in the National Intercollegiate
championships in the East. Bates,
however, has shown much improvement
in the preliminary matches this year and
will give the Cardinal representatives a
hard battle. Conrad has been rated
number two on the Blue and Gold line
up and will play in the second singles
match.
Dick Hinckley, captain of the 1924
freshman team and former junior dou
bles champion, will meet W. A. White,
Jr., in the third singles match of the
tournament. Very little is known of
White's record, with the exception of a
fair showing made' by him in the Idaho
state tourney two years ago.
The doubles teams picked to repre
sent Stanford are composed of Neer and
Davies, and Hinckley and Mertz, with
Ford Tussing as an alternate. Neer
and Da\ ies will meet Bates and Conrad
in the first match, while the second
doubles bout will be between Mertz and
Hinckley and White and Carol Jensen
of California.
Comparing previous records, Stanford
should take the tournament. Botli
doubles matches are doped to be Car
dinal victories, while the majority of the
singles events should be taken by the
Stanford trio. Yesterday afternoon the
doubles teams played several p/actice
matches in San Francisco with the Cal
ifornia Club stars, the Cardinal players
working more for forn\ and team work
than anything else.
