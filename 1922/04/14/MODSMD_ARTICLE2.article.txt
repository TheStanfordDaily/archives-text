# WELCOME TO OUR CITY; IS THE CRY OF ONION GEORGE
## 
### 
Onion George steps up and hands the
hospitable mitt to the incoming jour
nalists, in the April Pictorial, out Mon
day. Ditching the boiled halibut style
of greting, Onion explains why be
figures the outfit rates a regular hello,
then barks amiably at one and all.
They don't, says Marjorie Cohen, '24,
summarily answering the question, "Do
Co-eds Dress for Roughs?" That done,
she goes right on and gives numerous
highly personal reasons why women
choose a wardrobe, with a formula for
doing it yourself, if you want to.
Contrary to report, the Appointment
Office is not the place to make a date,
Clarence Stupid thought so, and went
there. His adventures under the guid
ing hand of Mrs. Snell are chronicled
by Robert R. Porter, '22, who declares
that Horatio Alger would come second
to Clarence in any fame and fortune
contest, after that. Completing the April
issue, C. A. Sheffield, '23, gives the third
stanza of the automobile crusade, mak
ing it two to one in favor of the gas
carts, on partial returns.
