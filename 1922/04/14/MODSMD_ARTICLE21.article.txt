# SUPPORTING A CHAMP MAKER
## 
### 
Ernie Brandsten's gang of swimmers go up
against the mermen from California tonight at the
Olympic Club in the big meet of this season. In the
last year Ernie has developed two men who are in
a fair way to be world's champions. A1 White beat
Clarence Pinkston last week easily and took the Na
tional title in the fancy dives. Hi Wooster is break
ing records in the 220. Neither of these men have
been active in aquatic events until this year. White in
particular being absolutely raw material at the time
Brandsten took him in tow.
While swimming is a minor sport at Stanford and
at California it is becoming more and more impor
tant every season, and this is largely due to the faith
ful work that Brandsten is putting in on the sport.
He says little; just goes ahead and turns out the
stars. This year he has a good team, strong in most
of the events, and working hard to put the name
of Stanford in the limelight of water sports, although
the sport is not a major. The swim tonight will be
a hard-fought one from the first and well worth
seeing.
