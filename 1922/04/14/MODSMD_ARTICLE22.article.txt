# HIGH SCHOOL TRACK
## 
### 
The annual inter scholastic track meet of the North
Coast Section of the California Interscholastic Fed
eration is here tomorrow. Again the Palo Alto
High School is picked as a likely winner. Boys from
all the schools of the bay region and surrounding
counties will be here to try and take home the title
to their county, however.
These boys have been here before in some cases.
-When they have been they have all expressed thanks
for the fine time they have been shown by Stanford
â€¢while visitors at the meet. Many letters come each
year from the principals of high schools throughout
the north coast district'of the state telling how much
the young fellows appreciate the courtesy that is
shown them while they are here.
This is not wasted in any sense of the word. The
friends that we make among these boys helps our
stock with the outside public and takes our fair name
into the homes of these boys, and from these homes
is where we get our immediate support. We have
some of them among us tonight. They are anxious
to see* the campus and know about our University
life. Any time that we spend 011 them will be re
paid many times in the good word that they spread
about our institution when they go away.
