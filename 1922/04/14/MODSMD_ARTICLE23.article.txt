# KEEP UP THE STREAK

### 
Stanford baseball team hit a winning stride last
week when both varsity and freshman teams wal
loped like organizations from across the bay in good,
air-tight form. Some people were surprised, not all
of them Blue and Gold supporters, and others were
just gratified. It has long been said when a Stanford
team goes up against the Berkeley gang it plays away
over its head. In fact, that is one of the most popular
saying with certain sporting writers of the city papers.
Last week there was no playing over anyone's
head except for a couple of long hits. The teams
simply played good hard ball and played all nine in
nings to win. That is the kind of playing that does
win games. A real representation of fans watched
the games and got a good satisfied feeling to see the
club perform. Tomorrow varsity and '25 will try
to repeat. A repeat on the red is a good bet in rou
lette. It looks like it were going to be good in
baseball. A crood crowd over at Berkeley will make

the repeat a lot more certain. The varsity series
goes three games, hut there is no time to take a loss
now when a win is in sight.
