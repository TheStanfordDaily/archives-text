# POMONA'S GLEE CLUB CONCERT
## 
### 
Tomorrow night the Pomona Glee Club will be
heard in concert in the Assembly Hall. Jn the south
among the colleges of the Southern California Con
ference the glee clubs are held in the highest esteem
and membership in the college club is considered one
of the best things a student can have. There being
a number of small colleges there the clubs make many
trips around and sing on the various campuses under
the auspices of the local club of the college enter
tained.
When the Stanford Club was south last year the
Pomona College men showed it a fine time in the mat
ter of entertainment while there and had a full house
for the performance. This northern trip of the Po
mona singers is a sort of return being given under the
auspices of the local club. The members of the Stan
ford Glee Club will provide for the southerners when
here as far as entertainment goes. Our part is in
turning out to show them that we appreciate the activ
ity and that we are backing our own glee club in the
same way that the southern colleges back theirs.
