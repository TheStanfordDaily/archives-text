# CORNELL AND STANFORD
## 
### 
Although Coach Templeton and his athletes are un
able to accept the invitation of the Cornell track team
to a casual meet and training quarters at lthica prior
to the Cambridge Inter-Collegiates, the Stanford
team and members of the student body appreciate
the courtesy of the Cornell men in extending the
invitation.
Templeton would like nothing better than the
opportunity to work out with the Cornell athletes
during a three- or four-day period before the na
tional meet. But as this event takes place at a time
when the track men can least afford to lie away from
their studies, the trip east and return must be made
in the shortest period possible, and it will allow of
little or 110 time for training or acclimating in the
East. '
Stanford is sincerely grateful to Cornell for the
courtesy to her track men, hoping that the future will
be more favorable in allowing of association with the
men of the great Eastern University.
