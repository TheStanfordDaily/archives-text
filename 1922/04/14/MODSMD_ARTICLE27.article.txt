Now Short is rather slim and long,
While Long is rather short,
So both have names entirely wrong,
For Long's name should be short.

Old White is inky-black,

Or White would be like Black.
If Short is long and Long is short,
And Black is lilly-white,
But—well, to cut a long tail short,
I'll say that wrong is right!
—Pelican.

Our Question Box
Dear Editor: —My wife does not miss me very much.
Is that a sign that she does not love me? —Pensive.
No, that is a sign that her aim is perfect.
* * »
Dear Editor: —I own a hen that lays eggs without any
shells. Do you think that these eggs are lost?
—Lotta Ground.
No, Lotta, only mislaid.
