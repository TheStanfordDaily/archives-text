GENOA CONFERENCE
The reparation's question is again
in fair way to be brought before the
Genoa Conference, according to to
day's report. This augurs well for the
success of the meeting. If its scope
can be enlarged to include reparations
and disarmament, the principles of a
permanent settlement of the European
economic problem may yet be laid
down. This step resulted from Berg
man's statement that Germany would
be unable to make further reparation
payments except through a foreign
loan which would improve German ex
change. The French immediately
shifted position and are now making
desperate efforts to drag the issue into
the conference, in the hope, of course,
that they may force payment on the
old conditions. Lloyd George has re
fused to give his support unless the
question is brought before all the dele
gates.
The Russian delegation is still con
sidering the report of Ihe London
experts. Indications are that Tchi
cherin will flatly reject the proposal
to alter the Soviet judicial system and
object to the neutral commission that
is to fix Russian indebtedness. His
attitude toward such interference in
Russian internal affairs isundoubted
ly sound. The situation is compli
cated by the Allies' formal acceptance
of the report of the London experts.
The wisdom of such an uncompromis
ing attitude at this time is question
able.
