## 
### 
Intramural baseball yesterday after
noon was a series of surprises. Loomis,
pitching for the Alpha Delta Phi nine,
violated all conventions of the game
by smashing out two home runs, help
ing his team defeat Sigma Nu, by a
score of 17 to 2. Walthers and Dwight
pitched for the Sigma Nu team.
The honors for the most complete
route of the series go to Phi Delta
Theta, by virtue of their 31 to 2 vic
tory over Alpha Sigma Phi. This was
a busy game for the outfielders, as the
Phi Delta Theta baseballers had their
batting clothes on. Craft and Edwards
handled the ball for the winners, and
a large part of the Alpha Sigma Phi
team took a turn in the box.
Beta Theta Pi took a fast game from
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 7 to 3. When
the slippery condition of this diamond
is considered, it is surprising that the
score could be kept so low. Reed and
Bruce did the heavy work for Beta
Theta Pi, Gifford and Draper forming
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon battery.
The tightest game of the day was
Theta Delta Chi's victory over Theta
Chi. *5 to 4. The game was called at
