Organizers Wanted
Men who have been "through the mill" enough to realize
that radical changes are necessary to make that mill a good
. workshop for themselves, their children and children's children.
But men without set convictions as to the precise nature of
the needed changes or the methods of bringing them about.
Hence men with open mind on all big questions, including,
particularly Economics, and even Religion. Not chronic or
crystallized believers or disbelievers, not hampered with ob
sessing fads or hobbies. Men who can see the value of "prac
tical idealism'' in business.
Not handicapped with serious financial or family worries.
The more all-around independent the better.
Fluent talkers, logical thinkers, well read. Men who have
kept themselves posted on large current events from a (more
or less) unbiased point of view.
Men with or without much artificial schooling to whom
their life has been a real education.
Of good presence, presentably dressed.
In robust health, of sound body as well as sound mind-
Such men are needed for pioneering in a highly important
campaign of organization.
Do you, Mr., Mrs. or Miss Reader, know of such a man?
Most likely it is not the reader: that kind of man seldom
reads this kind of advertisement.
In this advertisement we are fishing rather for names than
for applications. Send us the name and address on a postal
(postal preferred). It may be you own, but we do not care
to know. We are not interested in the sender as such. The
name may be fictitious as long as it establishes communication.
To that (to us impersonal) name and address we shall send
something to read, enabling the recipient to decide whether
or not to pursue the subject further. We shall disclose our
identity and enclose a photographic copy of this advertisement
with the information that someone has given us his name in
response thereto.
To whom of your acquaintances would you have us send
that "something to read"? It concerns men of various past
and present occupations, men who have not found their best
opportunity in those occupations. They may be or have been
attorneys, ministers, teachers, salesmen, agents, promoters,
advertising men, brokers, business men, engineers, chemists,
etc., and business or social organizers.
The advertiser feels that for a certain type of men this may
prove a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Some of them at least may be able to arrange their affairs
in such a way that they can hold on to the ground already
gained while proving to themselves whether or not this under
taking offers them a decidedly improved future in a materially
different capacity.
Your postal had better give us no particulars whatever.
Send the -name as a service, possibly to yourself, more
likely to someone for whom you hold a friendly interest.
The possibilities as to the earnings are fine: depend on
general results.
Presumably the size (cost) of this advertisement is suf
ficient evidence of the advertiser's good faith and responsi
bility.
