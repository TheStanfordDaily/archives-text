# KNOX MILLER, '23 CAPTURES JOFFRE DEBATING MEDAL
## Stanford Carries Off Prize in Annual Contest With Blue and Gold Forensic Artist 
### 
Stanford defeated California in the
annual Joffre debate, held last Fri
day night in Wheeler Hall, at the Uni
versity of California. The Joffre
Medal went to Knox Miller, '23, who,
in the opinion of the three judge, de
livered the most effective, all-around
speech.
Miller, in addition to this medal,
received a briar pipe, autographed by
Marshall Joffre. Each of the other
five speakers were presented similar
pipes, in accordance with the promise
made by Marshall Joffre when he was
in San Franciieo.
The question under debate was:
"Resolved, That France's position on
the submarine issue at the Washing
ton Conference was justified." The
affirmative of this question was sup
ported by Robert C. Binkley, '22, of
Stanford, and Sam Gardiner, '23, of
California. The negative was upheld
by Arthur Murphy, '22, and Howard
Bohnet, '22, of California; and Bert
rand Comparet, '24, and Knox Miller,
'23, of Stanford.
Miller, in supporting his contention
that France's demand for a subma
rine tonnage equal to that of Great
Britain was unjustified, maintained
that the only justification for any
armament is the necessity of defense.
The factors that should determine a
nation's naval requirements were, he
contended, the extent of its coast line,
the volume and nature of its com
merce, the need of protection for its
lines of communication, and its colo
nies; and in these for regards, Miller
contended that Britain's need for naval
defense was greater than France's. As
contrasted with the British, the
French requirements for national pro
tection, he concluded, demanded not
a large navy, but a large army.
Mayor Bartlett, of Berkeley, acted
as chairman of the debate. The three
judges were Mr. Frank Cornish, San :
Francisco attorney; Rev. C. W. Dut-1
ton, of San Francisco; and Professor!
Scott, exchange professor from Eng
land, to the University of California.
