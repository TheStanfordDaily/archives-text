# CAST FOR JUNIOR OPERA ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
After one week of tryouts the cast
for the 1923 Junior Opera was chosen
by Lester Seib, director of the pro
duction, and the Junior Opera Com
mittee. More than a hundred candi
dates tried out.
In Seib's estimation, there are four
leads. The feminine juvenile parts
will be taken by Geraldine Watt, '24,
and Edythe Baylis, '24, while Dick
Richmond, '21, and Dick Persh
ing, '21, will play the masculine
roles. Both Miss Baylis and Dick
Richmond have appeared in campus
productions this year, the former in
the sophomore play and Richmond in
the "Charm School." Pershing played
the leading role in last year's Ram's
Head show and was in "Koo Koo Ku
bistown." This will be Miss Watt's
first appearance in campus dramatics.
Ivo Copeland, '23, will be remember
ed for her work in the 1922 Junior
Opera. Helen Whitney, '24, and For
esta Hodgson, '24, have parts which
offer a specialty in Russian dancing.
Selections for the masculine char
acters were made with difficulty on
account of the large number of excel
lently fitted candidates. Warren
Lewis, '21, and Fred Hughes, '23, were
in last year's opera. Nelson Valjean,
'24. has made a distinct hit in the last

two Ram's Head Shows, while Stod
dard Atwood, '21, is well-known for his
past work in dramatics.

There will be a meeting of all mem
bers of the cast including the choruses
tonight, at 7:30 in the Assembly Hall.

"Who do you think would have done
it?" breathlessly thquired the reporter
of the local campus sleuth.
"Can't get a clue to work on,"
growled the sleuth. "The varlets
covered their tracks so durned well
that we ain't been able to trace 'em."
According to the tale which emulate
frum the local intelligence bureau, at
a dark hour on Saturday night two
footpads were seen in the vicinity of
the fast dying tnn. As the marauders
emerged from their hiding, they b >re
with them'a large dark object. With
the coming of the dawn, the holy re'ic
which had wafted in the breeze s'nee
was gonn! And ain't it too bad
when you consider that Pedro J. Le
n or, curator, intended to cure it for
the museum.
What are we talking about? The
Jrn sign, of course. Haven't you
missed it?
