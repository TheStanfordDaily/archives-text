						WELCOME TO JOURNALISTS

Editors and Managers of publications from the
various colleges of the West are gathered today at
Stanford in the second convention of the Western
Intercollegiate Press Association. Some of these
men have come over a thousand miles to meet here
and to try and further the journalistic bonds be
tween the many universities of the western part of
the United States. The movement is only part of
a larger move to put the publications of all the
colleges of the country in some sort of an organiza
tion to the benefit of all in matters of getting adver
tising, outside news, and to promote among the
institutions of the different sections of the country
a better feeling by the interchange of ideas through
their publications.
Success has been made in the last couple of years
with small associations in limited sections. The
Western Intercollegiate Press Association has in
mind the combining of all the groups of the country
west of the Rockies. No other association takes in
any more than either magazines or newspapers and
so their work is necessarily limited to one type of
news. Every kind of publication is entitled to rep
resentation in the W. I. P. A., however, and the
editors of papers in the smaller colleges of the
West are especially sought, it being the idea of the
association that it can be of help to the smaller
papers and other publications by extending to them
the news service that it runs.
Perfection of the dispatch services between the
institutions will be one of the main affairs of the
convention this time. Speakers of wide journalistic
experience and historical research will outline the
work of the press in other places than in the college.
A wire or wireless news service is sought to be
installed between the colleges in the association. If
this can be instituted soon it will mean a distinct
advantage to the colleges in getting outside news.
The program calls for sessions until Wednesday
noon. While the delegates are here they are wel
come to our campus and to our places of interest.
We want to show in the best way possible that we
are doing our part in making the Western Intercol
legiate Press the success that its ideals merit.
