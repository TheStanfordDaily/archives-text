# BRUIN NET STARS WIN THREE MATCHES IN TENNIS RATTLE
## 
### 
California upset the dope Saturday
morning by capturing the annual, dual
tennis tournament, winning three of the
live matches from the Cardinal. The
tourney, played on the Berkeley courts,
was one of the closest played in years,
and it was not until the last serve that
the match winners* were decided.
The first of the singles matches,
played between Phil Neer and Wallace
Bates, went to California. Bates played
a strong game throughout, and his plac
ing to the backlines was one of the
features of the match. The first set
was won by Bates, 6-4, while the tSan
ford captain rallied in the second, taking
it, 6-2. Neer weakened, however, in the
third set and the Californian won, 6-3.
The biggest upset of the day was the
defeat of Jimmy Davies by David A.
"Brick" Conrad. Davies played in poor
form and lacked the necessary punch in
the critical moments of the match. Con
rad made effective use of the backhand
stroke and forceful drives in the
pinches won the match for him, 6-3, 1-6,
6-2. Conrad is a former Stanford stu
dent.
The third and last of the singles
matchcs was taken by Dick Hinckley,
the 1924 freshmen captain, defeating
Carol Jensen of the Blue and Gold
team, 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. Hinckley got o to
a bad start, but managed to come back
in the last two sets, taking the match
with ease.
Playing a different brand of tennis
than shown in the singles, the Stanford
doubles team of Neer and Davies de
feated the California team of Bates and
William "Bee Boy" White, 6-2, 8-6. The
last set was strongly contested and most
of *the games were long drawn out in
deuce score. With the tournament de
pending upon the winner of the second
doubles match, played between Hertz
and Hinckley of Stanford and "Buzz"
Powers and Joe Whitehead of Califor
nia, the bout was the hardest-fought of
the day The first set went to twenty
iwo games, the Blue and Gold pair win
ning. 12-10 In the sccond set, Powers
and Whitehead showed better team work
and managed to take the set and the
match, 6-4.
