# INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING
## 
### 
Colonel Hanford McNider, National Commander
of the American Legion, lias enlisted the heads of
most of the colleges in the United States to bring into
the Legion the eligible men among the various stu
dent bodies. The idea of the move is to bring the
college trained men together on this common footing
to form a great and powerful force for the furthering
of national and international peace, the thing for
which we strove in the late war and which we are
now trying to attain by parleys and treaties.
As shown by the last war, the treaties have not
amounted to much, the "scraps of paper" talked
about were in the most cases not even taken notice of
at all when it seemed more advisable to the interested
governments to go ahead with some other scheme.
At the first of this year, in response to McXider's
letter, the presidents of the universities throughout
the country pledged their support. We have not yet
seen visible work here in the matter of publicity.
President Wilbur is, however, in favor of the plan of
an interallied veteran organization which has for its
purpose the procuring of assured and lasting peace.
The Legion is assailed often for either now being
lowered or soon to be lowered to the machinations of
politicians and with being sure to become a great
political party run by a military party of men. It is
to combat this that the aid of the students of the
country is sought by joining the Legion and putting
into it their thought and constructive ability. It is
simply the recognizing of the worth of balance in a
college trained man.
It is perhaps too much to say today that a majority
of the present students in college are men eligible for
the American Legion, but there are thousands of
eligibles today in the universities who are not mem
bers of the Legion. Those of us who are members
see the things that can be accomplished by a body
of such enormous size if it can be thoughtfully
directed and made to seek the ends that are planned
for it. A chance awaits us to do our additional bit
in completing the establishment of peace throughout
the world that we tsarted five years ago. If we treat
it right without allowing the undermining influence
of petty political affairs to crowd in the world can be
given its greatest service in history. Nothing has
ever existed probably that more demands our united
effort than this movement to build up an understand
ing among the citizens of the countries of the earth
so that instead of regarding each other with suspicion
they will look upon each other's actions realizing
what each is doing when his government initiates a
certain program.
