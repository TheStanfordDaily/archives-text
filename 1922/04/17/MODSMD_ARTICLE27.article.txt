but were unable to make a run. Then
in the fifth, with two out, the llermele-
Thompson wrecking crew trotted out
the gunpowder., A clean single and a
smashing double to center did the work,
and the score stood 1-0.
Fighting for the breaks, and getting
them, Stanford scored in the sixth.
Two were down when Woodward got
a single. Parker floated a nice Texas
Leaguer over third, and Woodward
reached that base safely. Morrow made
a wild pitch that got away from Thomp
son and rolled a few feet away from
the plate. Woodward tore for home,
and, although lie was apparently out by
ten feet, he slid into the plate with such
force that the ball was knocked from
Thompson's hands. That knotted it up
tight at 1-1.
For the next four innings Morrow did
not allow a hit. Draper was in luke
warm water all this time, and in the
tenth it became actually hot. Douthit
led off the merry lioo-rah with a double
to deep center. H. Makin chopped the
ball in front of the plate, and didn't
start for first, thinking it a foul. Greet*
thought differently, however, and sapped
the horsehide down to Heckendorf,
catching Douthit, who was ambling un
certainly ort the baseline between sec
ond and third. Heckendorf relayed the
sphere to Woodward, putting Makin
out. Everything was fine, except that
the umpires were thinking of something
far away, and saw only half the play.
Time was taken out for a tri-side de
bate, and when the fogs of oratory
finally lifted a Missouri compromise had
been reached. Douthit was out on
third, but Makin remained on first. Erb,
next up, slashed one at Heckendorf.
The ball took a bad bounce, and all
hands were safe. On the next two!
grounders, however, outs were made at
second, and, aside from reports of three
more cases of heart-failure iti the stands, j
all was intact, with the score still tied. ;
The twelfth inning, which came in i
like a lion and went out like a whole I
zoo, opened auspiciously. Green singled i
to center, and went to second on a wild j
throw by Morrow. Peavy flied out, and ,
Carver was safe on an unsuccessful
fielder's choice. Heckendorf bit one at
the first baseman, lie tried to catcli
Carver at second, and in so trying hit
Rov in the back with the ball, allowing !

Green to score. Tliat looked like the
regulation winning run. Two more
outs prevented further scoring.
California came up determined to
make the most of their last chance.
Douthit, first up, cracked out a single.
Makin popped out, and all seemed well.
But McHenry, batting for Erb, con
nected with a single, sending Douthit to
second. Radebaugh, batting for Mor
row, pinch-bit in the story-book style
and slapped one far and wide, scoring
Douthit. This was sad enough, bul
when Turner tapped a tantalizing Texas
Leaguer just out of Mitchell's reach
the depths of despair were reached.
McHenry scored with the winning run.

in the fifth, with two out, the llermele-
Thompson wrecking crew trotted out
the gunpowder., A clean single and a
smashing double to center did the work,

Fighting for the breaks, and getting
them, Stanford scored in the sixth.
Two were down when Woodward got
a single. Parker floated a nice Texas
Leaguer over third, and Woodward
reached that base safely. Morrow made
a wild pitch that got away from Thomp
son and rolled a few feet away from
the plate. Woodward tore for home,
and, although lie was apparently out by
ten feet, he slid into the plate with such
force that the ball was knocked from
Thompson's hands. That knotted it up
tight at 1-1.
For the next four innings Morrow did
not allow a hit. Draper was in luke
warm water all this time, and in the
tenth it became actually hot. Douthit
led off the merry lioo-rah with a double
to deep center. H. Makin chopped the
ball in front of the plate, and didn't
start for first, thinking it a foul. Greet*
thought differently, however, and sapped
the horsehide down to Heckendorf,
catching Douthit, who was ambling un
certainly ort the baseline between sec

sphere to Woodward, putting Makin
out. Everything was fine, except that
the umpires were thinking of something
far away, and saw only half the play.
Time was taken out for a tri-side de

next up, slashed one at Heckendorf.
The ball took a bad bounce, and all

grounders, however, outs were made at
second, and, aside from reports of three
more cases of heart-failure iti the stands, j
all was intact, with the score still tied. ;
The twelfth inning, which came in i
like a lion and went out like a whole I
zoo, opened auspiciously. Green singled i
to center, and went to second on a wild j

Carver was safe on an unsuccessful
fielder's choice. Heckendorf bit one at
the first baseman, lie tried to catcli
Carver at second, and in so trying hit
Rov in the back with the ball, allowing !

Green to score. Tliat looked like the

Douthit, first up, cracked out a single.
Makin popped out, and all seemed well.
But McHenry, batting for Erb, con

but were unable to make a run. Then
in the fifth, with two out, the llermele-
Thompson wrecking crew trotted out
the gunpowder., A clean single and a
smashing double to center did the work,
and the score stood 1-0.
Fighting for the breaks, and getting
them, Stanford scored in the sixth.
Two were down when Woodward got
a single. Parker floated a nice Texas
Leaguer over third, and Woodward
reached that base safely. Morrow made
a wild pitch that got away from Thomp
son and rolled a few feet away from
the plate. Woodward tore for home,
and, although lie was apparently out by
ten feet, he slid into the plate with such
force that the ball was knocked from
Thompson's hands. That knotted it up
tight at 1-1.
For the next four innings Morrow did
not allow a hit. Draper was in luke
warm water all this time, and in the
tenth it became actually hot. Douthit
led off the merry lioo-rah with a double
to deep center. H. Makin chopped the
ball in front of the plate, and didn't
start for first, thinking it a foul. Greet*
thought differently, however, and sapped
the horsehide down to Heckendorf,
catching Douthit, who was ambling un
certainly ort the baseline between sec
ond and third. Heckendorf relayed the
sphere to Woodward, putting Makin
out. Everything was fine, except that
the umpires were thinking of something
far away, and saw only half the play.
Time was taken out for a tri-side de
bate, and when the fogs of oratory
finally lifted a Missouri compromise had
been reached. Douthit was out on
third, but Makin remained on first. Erb,
next up, slashed one at Heckendorf.
The ball took a bad bounce, and all
hands were safe. On the next two!
grounders, however, outs were made at
second, and, aside from reports of three
more cases of heart-failure iti the stands, j
all was intact, with the score still tied. ;
The twelfth inning, which came in i
like a lion and went out like a whole I
zoo, opened auspiciously. Green singled i
to center, and went to second on a wild j
throw by Morrow. Peavy flied out, and ,
Carver was safe on an unsuccessful
fielder's choice. Heckendorf bit one at
the first baseman, lie tried to catcli
Carver at second, and in so trying hit
Rov in the back with the ball, allowing !

Green to score. Tliat looked like the
regulation winning run. Two more
outs prevented further scoring.
California came up determined to
make the most of their last chance.
Douthit, first up, cracked out a single.
Makin popped out, and all seemed well.
But McHenry, batting for Erb, con
nected with a single, sending Douthit to
second. Radebaugh, batting for Mor
row, pinch-bit in the story-book style
and slapped one far and wide, scoring
Douthit. This was sad enough, bul
when Turner tapped a tantalizing Texas
Leaguer just out of Mitchell's reach
the depths of despair were reached.
McHenry scored with the winning run.
