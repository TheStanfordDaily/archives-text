Did you even drink two dollars
worth of lemonade? Well then, you
don't know how it feels. No kidding
aside, it's the most—eh—unusual feel
ing since Nerve Potion went off the
market.
Penrod Schofield found all that out.
I.i about two hours.
"Penrod," the four-act production to
be nut on by the Alcazar Players
ment Committee has bought out the
next week, and for which the Endow
]2oo seats the night of the track meet,
call* foi five boys and one girl all
about twelve years old. "Bob" Rus
sell, known as one of the cleverest
boy actors on the Pacific Coast, has
been secured to play "Penrod." His
chum, "Sam Williams," will be in
the hands of Sumner Getchell, who
created a good deal of comment in the
part when the play was originally
staged last July. Lucile Shirpser, the
girl, has appeared many times in Al
cazar stock, and is in demand when
ever a child is needed by Bay City
stock companies. She will play
the role of "Marjorie Jones," Penrod's
initial sweetheart.
