## 
### 
At the performance of Dubois' well
known sacred cantata, "The Seven Last
Words," by the University Choir Fri
day evening in Memorial Church, Stan
ford and Palo Alto audiences heard a
production which, if not as elaborate in
scale as "St. Mary's" by Horatio
Parker, was undoubtedly as successful.

Mrs. Ruth May Friend, soprano,
whose voice is well known to audiences
here, sang with her usual clear quality,
and was admirably adapted to the type
of solo parts she took. The two male
•010 parts were taken by Warren Waters,
also prominent in musical circles, whose

baritone voice was appealing in its
depth and vigor of tone; and Marshall
Monroe, tenor, who, although compar
atively new to Stanford audiences, nev
ertheless delighted both with the qual
ity of his voice and his interpretation.

The cantata is essentially typical of
Dubois, and is one of the most vigor
ous of his compositions. The two duets
u ith the background of chorus were
especially effective. Throughout the
composition the grief is wonderfully ex
pressed in the minor cadencies and in
the dramatic response of the chorus to-

Dr. D. Charles Gardner conducted the
service, reading the words of the can

address was delivered by Dr. A. W.
