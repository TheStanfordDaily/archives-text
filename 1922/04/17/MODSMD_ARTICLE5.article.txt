# PALO ALTO FIREMEN VOLUTEER TO AID IN CAMPUS DRIVE
## 
### 
Co-operation between the campus
and Palo Alto Fire Departments has
been indicated by the assistance which
the town firemen are giving to Wed
nesday's Firemen's Fund Day pro
gram. In addition to a ten-dollar con
tribution, the Palo Alto red-shirts will
attentt the cabaret Wednesday evening
in a body, and will bring with them a
representative group of men from the
town.
The following letter was received
yesterday by Fire Marshil Ed Lamb:
The Stanford University Fire Depart
ment. Dear Gentlemen: â€”You will
find enclosed a check for ten dollars,
as a little token from the members
of the Palo .Alto Fire Department,
to be applied by your organization in
any manner that your members may
choose.
With the best lushes of the Palo
Alto Fire Department, I am yours
truly,
GEORGE W. TINNEY, Secretary.
With visitors from San Francisco,
Palo Alto, and surrounding communi
ties, added to the larger number of
students and faculty men who have
signified their intention of attending,
indications are that the cabaret will
be the largest stag affair on the cam
pus in many years.
