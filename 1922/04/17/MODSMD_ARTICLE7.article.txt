Stanford, 2; California, 3; twelve in
nings.
Big league baseball never furnished a
game more thrilling, or more heart
breaking to lose, than was furnished
Saturday on the California diamond
when the Cardinal varsity lost the sec
ond contest of the series to the Blue
and Gold. Fight and determination
were furnished in abundance by Stan
ford's nine, but the odds were too great,
and as a result the deciding game will
be played next Saturday at California.
The twelfth inning was the one that
furnished more cases of heart-failure in
the audience than any ten reel murder
movie has ever done. The score was
1 -all when the frame opened, and be
fore the Blue and Gold knew what it
was all about Captain Green had
crossed the plate with the run that
seemed to cinch the series for the Car
dinal. Then California got their last
chance. Only three outs stood between
Stanford and victory. But the Cali
fornia sluggers got their eye on the
ball, and four hits in a row brought in
the two runs that won.
By all rights of logic, California should
have won before the ninth, for they had
made twelve hits off Draper before the
tenth opened, and three of these had
been doubles. But logic counted for
nothing against the wonderful defense
furnished by the whole Stanford team.
Time after time California was on the
verge of scoring, and time after time
some hair-raising play cut off a run.
Two men were nabbed at the plate,
having made the mistake of trying to
get past Green—a thing that couldn't
be done. Woodward pulled some div
ing catches and one-handed stops that
would make any team in the civilized
world look good. Peavy at second
never hobbled a one of the many hard
ones he had to scoop up. Too much
cannot be said for the brand of ball
played by the whole nine on the de
fensive. When a team gets seventeen
hits, as California did, and then scores
only three, it speaks well for the op
posing defense.
The Cardinal attack was stronger than
last Saturday, but it did not come up to
California's hitting. Eleven safe ones
were coaxed off of Morrow's delivery,
and only one of these, Parker's double
in the eleventh, w.as an extra-base blow.
Green and Parker each got three safe
ties out of five trips to the platter, and
Maillot hit twice out of four times at
bat.
It was California's hitting that won
the game for them. Draper was never
entirely free from trouble, although lie
tightened up in the pinches many times.
Thompson and Mermcle were special
poison. The former got five hits—two
of them doubles—out of six times up,
and the latter got three blows the first
three times he had a chance.
During the first four innings the
Bruin diamond artists got seven hits,

Nibs Price's Blue and Gold fresh
man nine defeated the Cardinal babes
by a score of 11 to 5, in a ragged game
at Berkeley, Saturday morning. Coach
Price must have told his players a
great deal about the national pastime
after their 6 to 0 defeat by the Card
yearlings last week, for an entirely
different team wore the blue and gold
numerals Saturday. The team played
better baseball and displayed more
fight than in the first game.
Aydelotte who started for the Stan
ford freshmen, suffered the same fate
that Kelly, the cub pitcher, did in the
first game. The California babes took
the lead in the first inning, scoring
four runs on one hit, a fielder's choice,
two errors, a walk and a sacrifice hit.
The Card babes scored one run in the
second and two in the fourth and the
score stood 4 to 3. In the last of the
fourth, McKeaney, Cub short stop,
bounced one into the left field bleach
ers with two men on bases and three
more runs scored. Hoffman took the
mound in the last of the fifth when
Aydelotte allowed two hits, a walk,
and a run. He held the Bruin babes
to two hits and two runs during the
next three innings, but the damage
had already been done. The Stanford
yearlings brought their total to five
by scoring one in the sixth and an
other in the seventh.
The California freshmen played
better ball in the field than did the
Stanford freshmen,and all the breaks
of the game favored the Blue and
Gold yearlings. Kelly, who pitched
for the Berkeley babes allowed ten
hits and was constantly in trouble,
but was saved several times by sensa
tional fielding on the part of his team
mates. Most of the Cub's nine hits
counted for runs.
Kelly and Cuddeback were the
heaviest hitters of the day. Kelly got
two doubles, a single and a walk in
four trips to the plate, and Cuddeback
secured a double, two singles, and two
walks in six times at bat. In the third
inning, Cuddeback lifted one over the
right field fence into the bleachers
but was allowed only two bases on
the hit.
The deciding game of the freshman
series will be played here eifher on
Wednesday or Thursday of this week.
