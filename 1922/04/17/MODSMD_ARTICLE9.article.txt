# CARDINAL MERMEN OUTCLASS BRUINS IN ANNUAL MEET
## 
### Chesley M. Douglas, '23 
I lie Cardinal varsity swimming team
easily defeated the California mermen
in their annual tussle at the Olympic
Club tank Friday evening by a score of
40 to 27. The meet proved to be a

showdown on the records of the pre-

vious Stanford-California meets, with
the result that all the records but the
plunge for distance were lowered by
several seconds in every event. Both
teams broke three records apiece.

1 o Dud DeGroot, captain-elect of the
Cardinal football team, went the honor
of making the largest slash in the pro
gram of breaking records when lie low
ered the 100-yard back stroke mark by
10 2-5 seconds by swimming the dis
tance in 1:13:1. The record was
formerly held by Douglas Montell of
California. DeGroot is one of the stars
of the 1923 freshman team, but did not
compete last year. After a year and
a half's absence from competition he

returned /to the aquatic sport I about
three weeks ago and displayed more
class and speed than ever before.

'1 lie most exciting race of the big
meet turned out to be the 220-yard free
style, which Captain Austin captured in
the fast time of 2:24:4, cutting 5 1-5
seconds from the old mark. The first

three men to finish fought the race out
neck and neck nearly the entire race.
1 li Wooster had a slight lead at first,
then Mitchell of California slipped into
the front. After the last turn Captain
Austin cut loose a reserve of energy
and finished less than a foot ahead of
ihe Blue and Gold star. Wooster fin
ished about a foot behind Mitchell.
1 his race was the first time that Austin
had competed in the 220 event this year,
but Coach Ernie Brandsten pulled a sur
prise by Austin's entrance in this race.
As had been expected by the follow
ers of the water sport, Charl'es Fletcher
had no difficulty in taking the honors in
the 100-yard breast stroke race and also
in creating a new record of 1:17:1. The
old mark was 1:22. His teammate,
Kraemer, easily annexed second place.
Dempster of California finished third,
hut was disqualified for using the scis
sor kick.
Jack Robertson of California proved
to be the high point man of the meet
by winning the 50 and 100-yard free
style and practically winning the relay
for California. He navigated the
shorter distance in 25 2-5 seconds, which
is 3-5 of a second faster than the pre
vious record. In the 100-yard race he
set a new mark of 57 3-5 seconds, this
time. .
The relay was won by the Blue and
Gold team with a lead of about one
foot over Coach Brandsten's cohorts.
In winning the race the record was
lowered one second and now stands
1 :6:4.
A1 White. Cardinal diving star, seized
first honors with little trouble, but gave
his usual exhibition of the skill that last
week won him the national champion
ship. Don Sneddon took second for the
Cardinal team. Hawley and Fullerton
took first and second places, respect
fully, in the plunge for distance. Neith
er man made the distance they have
been doing in practicc, but probably this
was due to lack of practice in salt water.
