WANTED—A few men (young attorneys, writers, engi
neers, and business men) with bright minds and some spare
time, to take up certain problems and phases of problems
bearing on the development of San Francisco Bay and a more
economic method of distribution—especially of food products.
It is impracticable to go into details concerning my plans
in this advertisement, so have decided to invite those selected
from the answers hereto to an evening meeting where my
plan will be unfolded. As the applicant may not know me, I
will pay a nominal sum for attendance at a meeting to be
held in Palo Alto, date and place to be furnished him in our
reply.
We have no means of gauging the ability of the applicant
except his letter of application, so it behooves him to do him
self justice
After we have explained the plan, or phases of it, to those
selected, each one will be permitted, if he so desires, to execute
certain assigned work, which he may do in his own home or
office, receiving compensation therefor at his own valuation of
the work performed. We will then be able to decide whether
any particular man is desirable. There is his work: there is
his compensation: is value received? If not, the man is elim
inated. If yes, we go further into the unfolding of our plans
and the assignment of work.
We wish it understood that at the present time no perma
nent positions are offered, and this advertisement is directed
more especially to those who have employment for part of
their time. We assume there are many bright men in this
city whose "future" in their present line of endeavor seems
to them to be long deferred, who will welcome this opportunity
to take up something new and at the same time cling to the
ground already gained until they clearly see a very decided
improvement in their future in a perhaps very different
capacity with us.
We do not hesitate to assert that there are phases of our
plans which will appeal to men of ability in nearly every line
of endeavor.
Replies hereto, will be held strictly confidential and the
subject matter of subsequent meetings must be treated like
wise.
