# FORMER STARS TO ACT AS OFFICIALS AT BIG TRACK CLASSIC
## Foster and Snedigar Will Be Starters; Templeton's Men In Good Condition for Meet 
### 
Athletes who starred for the Car
dinal and Blue and Gold in "big meets"
of years gone by will act as officials at
the track and field classic at Berkeley
next Saturday.
One world's champion and two former
world's' record holders—Eddie Beeson,
George Horine, and Lee Scott—are in
cluded in the list. Ten years have
passed since Horine and Beeson of the
Blue and Gold staged their duals in the
high jump. In 1912 Horine shattered
the record with a leap of 6 feet 7⅛
inches. A year later Beeson defeated
the Cardinal jumper and set a new
mark of 6 feet 7 5-16 inches, which is
still unbeaten.
Lee Scott, '09, held the world's rec
ord in the pole vault for several years,
and his mark of 12 feet - 10 inches re
mains as the Stanford record in that
event. Stars of a more recent date
who are to officiate are "Here" Bihl
man and "Reg" Caughey, who used to
perform in the weights for Stanford
and also played on the 1919 football
team, and Cort Majors, former Cali
fornia shot-putter and captain of the
1920 eleven.
Frank Foster, coach of the Olympic
Club track team, and Ollie Snedigar, a
great all-round athlete twenty years
ago, and still active on the track, will
handle the gun.
There is little question but that Hart
ranft and Kirksey will be in good shape
fo rthe meet. Hartranft was not feel
ing well last week-end, and rather than
take any chances, the doctors sent him
to the hospital. He was up and about
the following day, however. Kirksey
has been working out every morning.
With the exception of Mint Howell,
all of Templeton's squad are ready for
the starting gun. Elliott, accorded only
an outside chance to place in the mile,
is in as good condition as three weeks'
time will allow. Howell returned to the
campus yesterday after a spell of the
"flu," but he will do no jumping until
the day of the meet.

One world's champion and two former
world's' record holders—Eddie Beeson,
George Horine, and Lee Scott—are in
cluded in the list. Ten years have
passed since Horine and Beeson of the
Blue and Gold staged their duals in the
high jump. In 1912 Horine shattered
the record with a leap of 6 feet 7⅛
inches. A year later Beeson defeated
the Cardinal jumper and set a new
mark of 6 feet 7 5-16 inches, which is
still unbeaten.
Lee Scott, '09, held the world's rec
ord in the pole vault for several years,
and his mark of 12 feet - 10 inches re
mains as the Stanford record in that
event. Stars of a more recent date
who are to officiate are "Here" Bihl
man and "Reg" Caughey, who used to
perform in the weights for Stanford
and also played on the 1919 football
team, and Cort Majors, former Cali
fornia shot-putter and captain of the
1920 eleven.
Frank Foster, coach of the Olympic
Club track team, and Ollie Snedigar, a
great all-round athlete twenty years
ago, and still active on the track, will
handle the gun.
There is little question but that Hart
ranft and Kirksey will be in good shape
fo rthe meet. Hartranft was not feel
ing well last week-end, and rather than
take any chances, the doctors sent him
to the hospital. He was up and about
the following day, however. Kirksey
has been working out every morning.
With the exception of Mint Howell,
all of Templeton's squad are ready for
the starting gun. Elliott, accorded only
an outside chance to place in the mile,
is in as good condition as three weeks'
time will allow. Howell returned to the
campus yesterday after a spell of the
"flu," but he will do no jumping until
the day of the meet.
