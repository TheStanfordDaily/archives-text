# Construction Work on Pageant Stage Under Way at Lake
## 
### 
Construction work of the outdoor
stage for the Women's Spring Page
ant, which will be given May 6, is
well under way at Lagunita. The
stage proper will be on the bank of
the lake near the band stand. The
ground for it has been ploughed up
and will be rolled and turf planted.
The seats will be across the path
on the side of the hill. Terraces are
being cut in the hill to form a natural
seating arrangement. According to
this pliin the spectators will have a
vista of the lake back of the stage
which will be broken only by the trees
and a Roman wall to be built on one
side.
The band stand will be turned to
face the hillside so that the music will
be. directed towards the audience. The
University Orchestra supplemented by
pieces from San Francisco will fur
nish the music for the dances and
pantomime numbers,
Mrs. Chloe Starks' art classes in
textiles will design the block printing
which will be used to form the borders
of the Roman costumes. The members
of the class will also make these cos
tumes, dyeing them to the desired
shades and applying the designs.
Rehearsals for the pageant are show
ing unusualy degrees of skill and en
thusiasm. Owing to the fact that there
will be only three or four more prac
tices for some of the dances, Helen
Greene, '23, chairman of the dance
committee, urges that every woman be
present at each practice on time. The
pantomime parts are being worked out
separately under the direction of Mar
garet Bailie, '24, who is also taking
the part of the hero of the fete.
