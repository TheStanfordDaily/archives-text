# Continuation Canvass to Be Started This Week
## 
### 
The endowment continuation com
mittee has completed its plans for
getting in touch with all Stanford stu
dents, and will start this week. In
opening this canvass, which will be
devoted especially to Palo Alto stu
dents and commuters, about one-fifth
of whom were seen during the four
day campaign, the committee makes
the statement that they are in no way
going to attempt to get subscriptions
from students by duress or "drive"
methods; the canvassers intend mere
ly to put the opportunity before every-
I body, and let them judge for them
selves of their ability to give.
The continuation committee, consist
ing of A. R. Tyler, '21, chairman; Clair
Senior, '22. Mabel Jones, '2H. B. W.
Wyatt, '2:?, W. K. Whiteford, '211 Violet
Andrews, '24, Orion Clark, '24, Carolyn
Strouse, '25, Leon T . David, '25. have
divided the partially canvassed dis
tricts, and wi'h a sub-committee to be
chosen, will go over the territory until
every one has been interviewed.
