# FIRE PREVENTION WEEK
## 
### 
This is Fire Prevention Week. It does not seem
any different to us than any other week, but through
out the country there is being conducted this week a
campaign of fire prevention propaganda to show the
public what a simple thing it is to prevent the occur
rence of most fires. Carelessness, the cause of half
the accidents of % world, is the main cause of fires,
and it is to stop this carelessness that the campaign
is being carried on.
We have been told many times in the past few
months of the dangers of fire in a community of
frame houses like the ones that a good part of us
dwell in. Some measures have been taken to make
it safer for us. New equipment has been put in that
has materially lowered the risk on buildings on por
tions of the campus, and the lire department has been
reorganized under a marshal who puts in most of
his time on fire prevention work. When he is not in
the engine house he is putting most of his time in on
some part of the campus doing some work that will
lessen the risks of fire in our houses. He has the
administration of the University behind him and is
not lacking for funds to do his work and do it well.
Many of us have cleaned up our cellars and garrets,
and many others have not. Student (ires have shown
how easy it is for sparks to quickly spread into a
conflagration when once they get a hold in the old
attics of our dwellings. Still many of us will not
heed but wait for the time when we will be the ones
on the bad end of a bill for repairs for damage done
by fire.
The winter has been unusually wet, and the grass
is luxuriant around the campus. As soon as this
dries there will be the finest kind of fuel for fire to
take ahold of, and we will have many of these little
blazes. We do every year, and no one thinks of
them for more than the moment when they are
burning. But each one is a menace to some building
if it should spread, so we cannot afford to let out
places go unprotected.
Tomorrow we have an assembly where the sub
ject of the talk will be 011 fire prevention. We can
get a good idea of the enormous loss that is suffered
each year by thoughtless people due to not making
preparation against fire if we go to the assembly.
The University is doing its part to make our living
safe while here. We should bear an interest in the
University enough to find out all we can about fires
in order that we may contribute our share toward
making the place the best risk possible from the stand
point of personal interest as well as duty toward the
community.

if it should spread, so we cannot afford to let out
places go unprotected.
Tomorrow we have an assembly where the sub
ject of the talk will be 011 fire prevention. We can
get a good idea of the enormous loss that is suffered
each year by thoughtless people due to not making
preparation against fire if we go to the assembly.
The University is doing its part to make our living
safe while here. We should bear an interest in the
University enough to find out all we can about fires
in order that we may contribute our share toward
making the place the best risk possible from the stand
point of personal interest as well as duty toward the
community.
This is Fire Prevention Week. It does not seem
any different to us than any other week, but through
out the country there is being conducted this week a
campaign of fire prevention propaganda to show the
public what a simple thing it is to prevent the occur
rence of most fires. Carelessness, the cause of half
the accidents of % world, is the main cause of fires,
and it is to stop this carelessness that the campaign
is being carried on.
We have been told many times in the past few
months of the dangers of fire in a community of
frame houses like the ones that a good part of us
dwell in. Some measures have been taken to make
it safer for us. New equipment has been put in that
has materially lowered the risk on buildings on por
tions of the campus, and the lire department has been
reorganized under a marshal who puts in most of
his time on fire prevention work. When he is not in
the engine house he is putting most of his time in on
some part of the campus doing some work that will
lessen the risks of fire in our houses. He has the
administration of the University behind him and is
not lacking for funds to do his work and do it well.
Many of us have cleaned up our cellars and garrets,
and many others have not. Student (ires have shown
how easy it is for sparks to quickly spread into a
conflagration when once they get a hold in the old
attics of our dwellings. Still many of us will not
heed but wait for the time when we will be the ones
on the bad end of a bill for repairs for damage done
by fire.
The winter has been unusually wet, and the grass
is luxuriant around the campus. As soon as this
dries there will be the finest kind of fuel for fire to
take ahold of, and we will have many of these little
blazes. We do every year, and no one thinks of
them for more than the moment when they are
burning. But each one is a menace to some building
if it should spread, so we cannot afford to let out
places go unprotected.
Tomorrow we have an assembly where the sub
ject of the talk will be 011 fire prevention. We can
get a good idea of the enormous loss that is suffered
each year by thoughtless people due to not making
preparation against fire if we go to the assembly.
