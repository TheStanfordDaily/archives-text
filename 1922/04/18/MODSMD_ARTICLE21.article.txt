# SUPPORTING THE CANDIDATES
## 
### 
Tomorrow the women students will choose their
council representatives for the coming year at a Quad
election. The senior receiving the largest number
of votts becomes the President of Organized Women,
two other seniors and two juniors receiving the high
est number of votes will make up the other four
members of the council. Each group and each in
dividual, through her group representation on Con
ference, has taken part in nominating the women
whose names will appear on the ballots. 1 lie num
ber of votes cast for the nominees will determine
the amount of the individual woman's interest in the
selection of her leaders.
Student self-government is a tangible expression
of student regard and interest in their own affairs.
Stanford women have enjoyed the plan of self-gov

ernment for a number of years. It has met the needs
of the women students in their various problems,
and its continued use is one of the most outstanding
proofs of its success.
The only danger to women's self-government
which has so far been apparent is a lack of sufficient
interest to make the vote a representative one. True
representation can be had only when every member
of the voting body is represented at the election, and
this can be accomplished only when every woman
makes it a point to cast her vote for the candidates.
