Popular Superstitions:
(A Selection from the Convictions Most Deeply Rooted
in the Average Mind)
That all engineers are by nature roughs, know not the
joys of snaking and abhor the tailor-made.
That two-hour oourses are pipes and that these same
two-hour pipes are harder than a heavy five-hour
course.
i*?iat only Bloateu Ilutocrats rate benzene buggies
around the campus.
That any reference to alcohol is exceedingly humorous.
That a snake lias no excuse for existing.
That an engineer studies harder than an eeon. major.
That only high brows read the Cardinal.
That debaters deserve support but are too try to listen
to.
That the *vindy Willy never says anything.
That your room-mate does not care how long you keep
him waiting before paying a debt.
That food around these parts is not fit to eat.
That everybody now in Cal. tried to get in Stanford
first and were refused.
That all fat people would like to be thin.
That all frosh need training and that the sophomores
are the proper persons to give them this training.
That Encina studies after eight o'clock.
That the dink is the only headgear worn by '25.
That campus dramatics are good.
That epigrams such as these are used merely to fill up
space and are never read.
—Paul Joseph,' 24.

Yes, I believe them even more now.

Rough—For the love of Mike, look at Charlie. I
didn't recognize him at first.
Rougher—l know it. He usually danced on the other
cheek.
* * *
Izzy—What's the matter.
Dizzy—Smith borrowed my togs for a trip.
Izzy—Well?
Dizzy—'He's hiking to New York.
