### 
RUSSO-GERMAN ALLIANCE
FORMED
An alliance has been negotiated be
tween Russia and Germany which de
finitely sets aside the Brest-Litovsk
Treaty and places the two states on a
basis of equality. Russia waived its
claim on Germany for an indemnity
of eighty billion gold marks which
was guaranteed to her by the Treaty
of Versailles. The two countries have
agreed to reciprocal "favored nations"
clauses to each other's commerce. The
treaty was signed at 8 o'clock Sun
day night and comes as a great blow
to the Allies. The Germans declare
that negotiations have been carried
on secretly for the past month and
that it was only by accident that the
treaty was signed during the Genoa
Conference. It need not, they say,
interfere with the progress of the
Conference.
Great Britain and France* fear that
the commercial alliance will 'be fol
lowed by a military alliance which
would mean the uniting of over two
hundred million people for purposes
of offense and defense. France would
be placed in greatest jeopardy by such
an alliance and her statesmen make
no secret of their great discomfiture
and disappointment at the result. It
will be interesting to see whether
France will withdraw from the confer
ence or whether she will attempt to
oust Germany. Some of the French
leaders believe that the treaty would
not have come about if it had not been
for Lloyd George's lenient policy to
wards Russia.
ATTEMPT UPON THE LIFE OF
MICHAEL COLLINS
Sunday evening shots were fired
from ambush at Michael Collins, the
leader of the Irish free state. He
believes it was a Republican attempt
to kidnap him and that he was fired
upon only because of his resistance.
Republican leaders claim that the as
sault on Collins was unintentional;
that he was mistaken for someone
else.
GREAT DAMAGE CAUSED BY
TORNADOS AND FLOOD
A number of people were killed and
injured and hundreds were driven
from their homes by severe storms in
Indiana and Illinois. Tornados are
reported in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,
and Indiana. The village of Irving
ton, Illinois, was practically destroyed.
Owing to six weeks of heavy rain
fall the Mississippi is at danger po
int near Caifo. Illinois. Several floods
have already accurred in Indiana.
