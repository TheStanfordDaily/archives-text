# ASSOCIATED BUYERS DESIGNATE DEALERS
## 
### 
The executive committee of the Stan
ford Associated Buyers has made four
trade agreements and designated official
dealers.
Considerable price reduction occurred
in every case. Ice cream in bulk was
reduced thirty cents per gallon and in
brick one dollar. Milk costs members
of the Association less than five cents
per pint when a gallon is ordered each
day, and less than four cents when two
gallons are used. Butter is supplied at
market quotation. The cleaners who
have been given the campus trade in
creased their discount from 20 per cent
to 30 per cent. In a year the Associa
tion intends to save $15,000, and under
the expansion of purchasing functions
this saving will be much greater. Be
fore any bid to supply perishable goods
was accepted, the Palo Alto Health De
partment examined the shops and tested
the products thoroughly.
In making these agreements bidding
methods are used. Before accepting
bids, the committee takes into considera
tion price, quality, service, healthful
ness, and ability to handle the trade.
So far, excepting cleaners, only firms
supplying perishable goods have been
dealt with.
The Association deals in perishables.
Buying staples is under the direction of
Miss Etta Handy of the new Union,
who puts i:i orders weekly with the pur
chasing agent of the Lane and Stanford
hospitals in San Francisco. In the lat
ter case co-operation by campus groups
is unnecessary.
At present the Association is consider
ing bids for the bread and vegetable
trade. Later on it is hoped to make a
large saving by buying coal in one big
order.
