A telegraphic golf match is the latest
suggestion for intercollegiate competi
tion on the Pacific Coast. The Univer
sity of Washington has written Captain
Rosenblatt of the Stanford golf team
asking for a match to be played off in
this manner.
Because of the differences in courses
and weather conditions, Captain Rosen
blatt says, a meet of this kind would not
give very definite results and could not
show the relative abilities of the two
teams. However, Rosenblatt says, golf
is only in an embryonic stage 011 the
coast and competition by telegraph
would at least stimulate interest in the
sport and make possible closer relations
later.
