# DAVIS WILL ATTEND CHICAGO CONVENTION
## 
### 
Gordon Davis, Stanford dramatic
coach, left yesterday for Chicago
where he will attend the convention
of the Drama League of America, to
be held Thursday, Friday and Satur
day of this week. Davis will speak
on "Dramatics at Stanford."
Stanford has gained a nation-wide
fame for the quality of her dramatic
productions since Coach Davis has
been in charge, and he hopes to bring
back new ideas which will place the
drama on a still higher plane than it
now holds here. It will be remember
ed that Davis was referred to as 'Hhe
Belasco of the West" in a recent
article in "Billboard," national theat
rical magazine.
