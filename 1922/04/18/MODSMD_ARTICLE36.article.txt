# SOPHOMORE CLASS TO GIVE BENEFIT DANCE
## 
### 
The sophomore class will give a
dance in the new pavilion, May 6. A
ten-piece orchestra will be secured
and programs furnished. The admis
sion price has been set at $1.50.
This dance is part of the program
to help in reducing the class debt.
The program also includes a plan
whereby the class will sell cords to
its members for next year. These
cords will be sold through the courtesy
of Ed Landels of the Encina haber
dashery and will cost $5.75. Men will
be sent around in a few days to the
living groups to solicit the advance
deposit of one dollar for the cords.
The remaining $4.75 will be paid upon
delivery. The committee in charge
wishes to emphasize that these are
regular $6 cords and will be cut to
measurement.
