# Woman's Dedication of Fraternity House Destroys Part
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO, April
13. ( P.I.P.A.) â€”The big feature of the
opening of the new Phi Delta Theta
house Saturday was the hurling of the
bottle of dedicating solution through
a plate-glass window instead of against
the side of the building. Miss Lucy
Davis, a member of the Kappa Kappa
Gamma, demonstrated woman's accu
racy when she missed the brick work
at a short range and smashed the win
dow to hits.
