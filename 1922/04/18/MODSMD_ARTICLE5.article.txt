# FIREMEN'S CABARET PURELY STAG AFFAIR
## Slime of the Underworld Will Be Revealed in Ram's Head Skit on Movie Production 
### 
"The word 'cabaret' does not neces
sitate the presence of women," said
H. 13. Rorke, '24, chairman of the
Firemen's Fluid Committee, today.
"There seems to be some misunder
standing about the nature of the enter
tainment tomorrow night. It is to be
a purely slag affair —no women —all
men —no queening—unlimited rough
ing—a genu-ine lie-party."
Among the many other visitors who
will be present in the Pavilion when
the program starts at 8 o'clock, will
be the delegates to the Western Inter
collegiate Press Association, the final
night, of their convention here, having
been reserved for the Firemen's Caba- j
ret.
"Rosc.oe's Revenge, or the Under-'
world Slime," is the romantic title of,
Carl Shoup's travesty on "movie" pro-j
duction, which is being produced by j
Ram's Head Society. Dainty Paul |
Claflin of "Bedelia" fame will be the
lovely heroine who succumbs to the
masculine charms of the hero, Arnold
Bayley. Because of the dastardly na
ture of his role, the name of the vil
lain is being with-held. Bill Shiels
and "Nip" Mcllose, as directors and
camera man, control the destinies of
the other characters. That is only one
feature of the evening's (entertain
ment.
All other organizations on the cam
pus will sink into significance tomor
row morning when the Stanford Fire
Department takes the front. The day's
activities begin with the Fire Pre
vention Assembly at 9. An hour later
the thirty-five piece San Francisco
Firemen's Band will arrive to lead the
parade through the streets of Palo
Alto. In the afternoon, the visiting j
musicians will entertain with a con- J
cert in front of the New Union, and j
at 8 o'clock in the evening will come j
the crowning event, the University j
Firemen's Cabaret in the Pavilion.
