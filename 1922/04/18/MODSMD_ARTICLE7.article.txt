# BANQUET IS CLIMAX TO FIRST PRESS SESSION
## PROFESSOR ROBINSON TELLS JOURNALISTS' RELATION TO ARMS CONFERENCE 
### 
Edgar E. Robinson, professor of
American History at Stanford, was the
speaker of the evening at a banquet
held last night in honor of the Western
Intercollegiate Press Association which
is being held 011 the campus. The topic
of the speech was "Publicity and Prop
aganda :tt the Washington Disarmament
Conference." Professor Robinson was
iu personal contact with the journalists
at the conference, and he gayc many
inside glimpses of the method in which
the news of the convention was given
out.
One of the most interesting teatures
to the journalists was the classification
of the writers at the convention. Pro
fessor Robinson put them into four
classes, namely, fact, feature, opinion,
and interpretative journalists. The
speaker said that in his opinion the last
two classes played the most important
part in covering the news of the meet
ing. He believed that the "opinion"
class of journalists came to the Wash
ington conference with a definite idea
011 which to work and that they were
working all the information which they
were able to obtain around this idea.
These writers, he thought, soon gave
way to the interpretative journalists or
the people who compared the functions
of the meeting with past history and
who looked ahead to see how the efforts
of the assembled nations would work
out. One of the things that impressed

him most was the attention paid to the
publicity of the conference.
When Professor Robinson arrived in
Washington he found that most of those
assembled were firm believers in some
sort of method by which future wars
could be stopped. He thinks that the
reason that the conference was such a
success was because the American dele
gates knew what they wanted from the
start. The fact that Secretary Hughes
came forward 011 the first day of the
convention and suggested s a ten-year
naval holiday and the 5-5-3 ratio was,
lie stated, the act on which the confer
ence worked throughout the entire
meeting. He contributed the success of
Lord Balfour to the fact that soon aftvir
the convention opened that Balfour
accepted for Great Britain the American
plan and knew exactly what he wanted.
The banquet was a seven-course din
ner held in one of the rooms in the New
Union. There we're about sixty present,
including the delegates from the west
ern states.
At the regular morning session Ernest
J. Hopkins, staff writer of the San Fran
cisco Examiner, spoke on "The Prob
lems of a Staff Writer 011 a City News
paper." After the talk an open discus
sion was held on "Advertising in College
Journals" and other similar subjects.
Tonight at the President's Mansion,
Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur will give an in
formal dance in honor of the conven
tion delegates.

including the delegates from the west
ern states.
At the regular morning session Ernest
J. Hopkins, staff writer of the San Fran
cisco Examiner, spoke on "The Prob
lems of a Staff Writer 011 a City News
paper." After the talk an open discus
sion was held on "Advertising in College
Journals" and other similar subjects.

Edgar E. Robinson, professor of
American History at Stanford, was the
speaker of the evening at a banquet
held last night in honor of the Western
Intercollegiate Press Association which
is being held 011 the campus. The topic
of the speech was "Publicity and Prop
aganda :tt the Washington Disarmament
Conference." Professor Robinson was
iu personal contact with the journalists
at the conference, and he gayc many
inside glimpses of the method in which
the news of the convention was given
out.
One of the most interesting teatures
to the journalists was the classification
of the writers at the convention. Pro
fessor Robinson put them into four
classes, namely, fact, feature, opinion,
and interpretative journalists. The
speaker said that in his opinion the last
two classes played the most important
part in covering the news of the meet
ing. He believed that the "opinion"
class of journalists came to the Wash
ington conference with a definite idea
011 which to work and that they were
working all the information which they
were able to obtain around this idea.
These writers, he thought, soon gave
way to the interpretative journalists or
the people who compared the functions
of the meeting with past history and
who looked ahead to see how the efforts
of the assembled nations would work
out. One of the things that impressed

him most was the attention paid to the
publicity of the conference.
When Professor Robinson arrived in
Washington he found that most of those
assembled were firm believers in some
sort of method by which future wars
could be stopped. He thinks that the
reason that the conference was such a
success was because the American dele
gates knew what they wanted from the
start. The fact that Secretary Hughes
came forward 011 the first day of the
convention and suggested s a ten-year
naval holiday and the 5-5-3 ratio was,
lie stated, the act on which the confer
ence worked throughout the entire
meeting. He contributed the success of
Lord Balfour to the fact that soon aftvir
the convention opened that Balfour
accepted for Great Britain the American
plan and knew exactly what he wanted.
The banquet was a seven-course din
ner held in one of the rooms in the New
Union. There we're about sixty present,
including the delegates from the west
ern states.
