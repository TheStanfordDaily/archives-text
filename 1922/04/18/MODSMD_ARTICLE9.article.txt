# "DAD" MOULTON SEES SIXTY-SEVEN POINTS FOR CARDINAL SQUAD
## 
### 
When the last event is over in the
Big Meet next Saturday, will "Dad"
Moulton have called the turn again?
If so, then there will be no Blue and
Gold victory.
The veteran trainer, associated with
Stanford athletic teams for over twenty
years, sees sixty-seven points in the
condition of his athletes. There will lie
one point to spare in the Cardinal vic
tory, says "Dad," no more, no less.
"Dad" has probably predicted the out
come of more Stanford-California tracl*
meets correctly than any other man,
even including "Brick" Morse. Nearly
half a century ago lie was one of the
leading sprinters of the country, and has
been connected with the cinder path
ever since that time.
So when he says he can see sixty
seven points for Stanford, there must
be something to it.
