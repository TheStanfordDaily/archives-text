# CARDINAL BABE NINE 10 MET BEAR CUBS IN DECIDING BATTLE
## Final Game of Series Played Tomorrow Afternoon, Hoffman or Teague Pitch 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball team
will meet the Blue and Gold Babe nine
tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock on the
Stanford varsity diamond, in the decid
ing game of the freshman series.
Tomorrow's game should be the best
and closest of the series, as each team
has a victory to its credit. The Stan
ford babes won the first game of the
series by a score of 6-0 and the Berkeley
yearlings won the second, last Saturday,
11-5. The Cardinal men have not
played the kind of baseball they are
capable of, in either of thsee games.
Although they outhit the cub nine last
Saturday, they booted the game away
in the field. Coach Kallam has been
working his men hard this week and
they are beginning to show improve
ment over their playing of last Saturday.
The infield is working with more pre
cision and the outfielders are gathering
in the long ones in the same satisfac
tory manner. Not an error has been
chalked up against the Card babe out
fielders during the series.
Hitting practicc took up most of the
time last night and the babes were
knocking the apple to all corners of the
lot. In the first two games of the
series, the Card babes have outbatted
successful in bunching their hits. Kal
lam's men are resting today and should
be in the best of shape for tile game.
With one or two minor changes, the
lineup will be the same in tomorrow's
game as it was in the first two games
of the series. Johnston first, Roberts
second, Cuddeback third, and Mulchay
shortstop, will make up the infield. If
these lads are right, nothing will get
past the inner defense. Dick Lawson,
McCandless, and Hoffman, Teague, or
Follansbee will lill the outfield posi
tions. Jim Lawson will be in the usual
position behind the bat. Lawson.'s leg
has almost entirely recovered from the
injury sustained last week. Kallam has
not announced his choice for slab duty,
but it is probable that either HofYman or I
Teague will draw the assignment, with ]
the odds favoring the former. Hoffman
held the Blue and Gold hitters safe in
the three innings he worked last Satur-
day and is in good shape. Teague, who
played the outfield in the last game, has
been pitching during the preliminary
season and may break into the game.
Kelly, the slim youngster who gets
himself into and out of more holes in
one game than most pitchers do in three,
has pitched the first two games for the
Bear cubs and may be Coach Price's
choice again tomorrow. O'Rouke is the
other possible choice.
Admission to the game will be fifty
cents to the general public and twenty
five cents to students with student cards.
