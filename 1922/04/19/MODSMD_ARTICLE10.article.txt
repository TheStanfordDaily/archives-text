# POPULAR ACTORS INCLUDED IN LARGE "PENROD" CAST
## 
### 
A cast of eighteen people, headed by
Gladys George and Dudley Ayres, is
included in the Alcazar Players' produc
tion of "Penrod," for which the en
dowment committee has bought all seats
of the Alcazar Theater for the Satur
day night performance in San Fran
cisco following the track meet.
Six children, who will take the parts
of Penrod Schofield, his five boy chums,
and bis schoolgirl sweetheart. Marjorie
Jones, have been selected from among
the juvenile talent in the bay cities. San
Francisco critics who' have already seen
the performance which opened Sunday,
say that these children are not only
competent in their parts, but carry their
parts with charming naturalness and
lack of artificiality. "Bob" Russell, tak
ing the tilk' role of "Penrod," is par
ticularly praised for his work as "Pen
rod," who is always starting something
and always being misunderstood on ac
count of it.
Gladys George, the leading lady, who
takes the part of "Margaret Schofield,"
Penrod's hasassed sister, has been with
the Alcazar company nine months, pre
vious to which she was playing leads

in motion pictures, appearing opposite
Thomas Meighan in "The Easy Road."
Walter Belasco, veteran ?tage director
and brother of David Belasco, is man
aging the production.
In direct contract to the "road shows"
that come to San Francisco, which" gen
erally have one star and poor support,
the Stock Company includes
only actors of veteran ability. These
artists are secured by the Alcazar be
cause of the advantages of continued
work in one city.
The plot, which is based on Booth
Tarkington's series of stories which ran
in the Cohmopolitan concerns the am
bitions and adventures of four boys,
headed by Penrod. Their ordinary
make-believe feats as amateur detectives
are broken into by the advent of a real,
honest-to-jimmy creek, who provides the
opportunity to try out the detectives'
effectiveness in real life.
Tickets for the performance next Sat
urday, which will also include a number
of between act stunts by Ram's Head
and other campus organizations, arc on
sale at J. E. McDowell's office, and at
Crandall's in Palo Alto, at $1.50 for any
seat in the house.
