Campus clothes are in order tonight
for the entertainment in the Pavilion
which will come as the culmination
of a day devoted to the interests of
the Stanford Fire Department.
Although women have been abso
lutely forbidden the privilege of com
ing or of being brought to the affair,
the committee has arranged for the
presence of a number of charming bits
of femininty—not of the co-ed type.
These women will lend the cabaret
color to the evening but will not in
flict themselves upon those of the
roughs to whom the presence of wom
en is annoying.
The important feature of the even
ing will be the San Francisco Fire
Department Band, which will sand
wich numbers between the other acts.
The band was heard in a brief concert
in front of the New Union this after
noon. During the San Francisco Ex
position of 1915, the firemen found
themselves called upon frequently to
parade through the city streets. Fnd
it necessary to secure some sort of
band for each of these processions,
the department finally organized one
despite several close meets.
Stanford will score sixty-seven
points next Saturday, according to
preliminary observations, says Coach
Templeton. "Dad" Moulton, trainer
of the Cardinal track squad, also fig
ures sixty-seven for his men. Kirk
.sey's leg is in none too good a con
dition, and he is more or less of an
enigma. 6as far as two firsts in the
dashes are concerned.
It is more than • likely, however,
that the former Stanford captain will
romp home first in both the 100 and
*220 events, and in fast time. This is
his last meet, and he has has heart
-set on lowering the marks in the cen
tury and furlong.
Templeton's biggest surprise, if it
happens, will be a second in the broad
jump. The Cardinal coach thinks that
Minsky, on the California take-off, will
be able to do nearly 22 feet 6 inches,
which will be good for third, and pos
sibly a second.
A clean sweep is conceded the
Bruins in the mile by Templeton, as
Elliott has little chance of placing.
Myers, however, is counted on to take
third in the two-mile grind. Others
that Templeton looks to see place are
Hayes in both the hurdles, Scofield and
Daly in the half, with Bauman of Cali
fornia having almost an even chance
of breaking the tape.
Reports from Berkeley indicate that
the equilibrium of the Bruins' well
balanced team is being disturbed by
injuries to Van Sant and Hutchison
The Blue and Gold skipper is down
with acute tonsilitis, and "Brick'
Morse vouches for the statement that
Van Sant has been hobbling around
on crutches. With both of these out
of the meet, or in poor condition, the
Cardinal team is conceded the ad
vantage.
