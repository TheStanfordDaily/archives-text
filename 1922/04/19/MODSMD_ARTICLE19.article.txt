# A
						ROUGH'S NIGHT
## 
### 
1 lie Firemen's Cabaret holds out interest for this
evening", that is, the interest of the male portion of
the student body. Something not soon to be for
gotten is promised by the committee in charge of the
stunts. They are advertised as being real rough and
bad, in fact horrid. This ought to make them inter
esting to a community unaccustomed to anything
other than performances which are prosaically per
fect and beautiful.
But to get away from any comments on how our
sensibilities are to be affected, the show tonight is a
proposition in which we all have an interest. Our
fire department is in need of fireproof and water
proof suits. This night of entertainment has been
made to furnish an attractive evening for the "lone
wolf" who likes to have his night to howl, but doesn't
crave a lady to hover near him and listen to his vocal
efforts. Here in the basketball pavilion we will have
a chance to howl to our heart's content at the funny
antics of the performers, and listen to the struggles
of two brass bands when they try to drown out each
other in bursts of melody.
The Firemen's Band of San Francisco has come
down to the campus to donate its services to the en
tertainment. The Stanford Band is doing its part
in making the evening a success. Here is our one
chance to get together without any of the loved,
hated, exalted, bedamned, and so forth sex to in any
way interfere with whole-souled enjoyment on the
part of the shy flowers who shrink from the touch of
feminine association. The word to the thoughtful is
to wear spikes because it is going to be rough. Only
2000 seats, and shortage of cardboard at the crucial
moment, as the sport writer would say. One last
prayer: remember the main (high pressure) and be
kind to the umpire.
