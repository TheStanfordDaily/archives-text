# VANITY FAIR BOASTS THIRTY CONCESSIONS FOR CARNIVAL NIGHT
## 
### 
Thirty concessions, ranging from
chute-the-chutes to horse shows, will be
grouped within the enclosure of Vanity
Fair to welcome the King and Queen |
when their reign begins 011 the night of
April 28.
Besides the Ram's Head Ballet, the
free entertainment offering for the
delectation of the beholder of the high
est type of song and dance art, inter
preted by a chorus of eight campus
beauties, there will be two other inno
vations in music and terpsichorean spe
cialties, offered by Kappa Kappa Gamma
and Alpha Delta Phi, and by Delta
Gamma and Phi Delta Theta, making
the grand total of "ladies of the chorus"
come to twenty-five.
Fifty girls will appear in the ultra
modern costumes of Vanity Fair, not
counting the sprightly maidens who
will act as escort of honor to the King
and Queen of the Carnival, and as la
dies-in-waiting to the Queen. Each gown
is to be a distinctive creation, governed
by the whimsy of the Vanity Fair
modiste, and each of the damsels will
be framed in a concession whose softly
blending colors, intimates by George
Thompson, scenic director, will combine
to set off the dainty draperies in a vision
of glowing hues.
