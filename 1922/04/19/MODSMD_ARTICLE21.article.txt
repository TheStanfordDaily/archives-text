# AVOID THE RUSH
## 
### 
Tt is still possible to obtain tickets to the track
meet at the campus ticket offices. \s always many
arc holding off to the last minute on getting the ad
missions. At no time has there been such a call for
tickets as now and the limited capacity of the bleach
ers on the California field will be overfilled on the
day of the big meet. The chance to get the tickets
here makes it possible to avoid all the rush of the
gate with the standing in line for an hour that will
l>e necessary if delay is made in buying until getting
to Ucrkeley. Take the hint and get vours now.
