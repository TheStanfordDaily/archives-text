"Do Co-eds Dress for Roughs?"—or some such ques
tion, asks a dame in recent edition of Police Gazette.
Preposterous at first glance; but as Ed Lamb says,"a
telescope often puts another view on the situation."

Cabbages firmly believes that the people want to
know something more about history than just a bare
recital, you know, of the facts. Accordingly, Cabbages
delves into forthcoming files, and announces with unc
tion a new future, a wart on the nose of time, as it were:

"If Dripper Works Saturday," said Hugo, the mid
night moth, snatching one off the plate, "the way he
worked Monday, we ought to win hands down."
* * *
Nut—Shh, there's a price on my head!
Mutt—Yeh, you do need a haircut.

Hand it to the woman who christens a house by
flinging the bottle through a window. Seeing as she
had to break glass anyway, it was well she didn't break
the one that would spill anything.
• * *
Seems that the latest entertainment is a contest be
tween boxers and wrestlers, with nothing barred except
hammer lock and rabbit punch. Why stop there? Why
stop at all? Why not get the champion sword-swallower
and the long-distance spitter to put on a pie-eating con
test?
* * «
While dashing to press, we pause to note that the
initial nominator ceases to be queen. Wonder what
Mary, queen of Scots, will say?
♦ * *
A cat can always look at a king, but very few can
vote for one.
* * *
They painted the fire hydrants white. That's so's you
won't mistake them for water hydrants.

Question is, did they paint the lamp-posts orange so
that valve-in-head lights could pick them off easier?

We believe in reform. In fact, we stand firmly be
hind it; even get out in front and shove on any that
comes up. Right now it seems that there is a crying,
not to say a howling, need for reform in the matter of
noises made by the people you see in the funny papers.
Undoubtedly, one could improve and enlarge on such
expressions as "Ah-chew." Such things are really quite
trite, and whenever any one makes such a remark you
may be sure that he is not trained in the more polished
forms of intercourse.

Have you ever been afraid of making the wrong noise
in the right set. It is not necessary. When you finish
the following remarkable set of Right Noises for Every
Occasion, you can't go wrong:
POONK—In use whenever habv hits papa with the
ice pick.
BLOUG—A noble noise for Annabelle's first coming
out party.
WAWF—One of the better noises employed in drown
ing.
BLA-SWUNK—Greatly in demand whenever a cauli
flower is dropped down one's neck.
OOK—Rather more in vogue since the advent of the
pogo sticks.
MOWSH—When the coke straw reaches the end of
navigation.
Editor (a bum)—Hand me the paste. \
Editee (aside)—Here's my chance.
* * *
Speaking of the Inn — Well, why not? — We have
noticed a marked decrease in the amount of Orientally
prepared hash since they started tearing up the under
neath part.
* * *
Another one of those things:—"Give 'er the gas," said
the dentist as he sharpened up his tools.
* # «*
Clarence:—I don't think we ought to leave that light
out there in the hall.
Clarise:—No, let's leave it out here.
* • •
A giant Firemen's Band, huh? Well, for once there
ought to be some really big men on the campus.
• * •
"Air on G String," is part of organ recital Saturday.
Make your own joke.

The Lay of the Last Easter Egg
The wait was long, the soup was cold.
The hasher was infirm and old.
Full many a time and oft had he
Chanted nightly, "Coffee or tea?"
Alas, that we should see him here,
Sadly passing out root-beer.
But lo! He comes to break the fast,
And bring the omelet at last.
What's this? A mirthless fantasy,
In blue and mauve, and ebony.
"Oh, yet," he says, "That's six bits more,
"Those were Easter eggs, three days before,"

EVEN CORDS HAVE AN INTERCOLLEGIATE
