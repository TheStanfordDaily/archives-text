ALLIES DECLARE RUSSO-TEUTON
TREATY VOID
The Allied and Little Entente pow
ers have expelled Germany from the
Conference Committee dealing with
Russian affairs because of her action
in signing a separate treaty with Rus
sia on Sunday. Since the Russian
question pervades practically every
problem that might be brought before
the session, the punishment meted out
by the Allies virtually amounts to
barring Germany from further parti
cipation in the Conference. In a note
sent to the German Delegation yester
day signed by Lloyd George (England)
and Barthou (France), it was stated
that Germany by her action had vio
lated the pledge she had taken when
she entered the session. She had
agreed to a frank cooperation with the
allies. When a separate treaty had
been made by Russia, Germany had
renounced all further participation in
the discussion of the conditions of
agreement between Russia and the
other countries represented at the
Conference. Walter Rathenau, Ger
man Foreign Minister, stated that he
had tried three times within a week
to see Lloyd George in order to in
form him of Germany's discussions
with the Russians. Each time he had
been informed that Lloyd George was
too busy. After hearing' that £he
British were making arrangements
with Russia which would be harmful
to Germany and further isolate her,
Rathenau decided to conclude the ne
gotiations which had begun in Berlin.

partment made public a letter to Sen
ator McCumber in which he had stat
ed that, instead of a deficit for 1922
as had been expected, there would be
a small surplus, but by 1923 the de
ficit would be $359,000,000 as com
pared with the budget estimate of
