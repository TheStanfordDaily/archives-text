# SEQUOIA NINES TAKE INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
The two teams drawing from Sequoia
Hall both figured in the feature con
tests of yesterday's intramural baseball
program. Team One, playing against
Phi Kappa Psi, brought home the tro
phy by the narrow margin of one run,
the final score standing 6 to 7. Prior
and Smith did battery work for Sequoia
One, with Richmond and McAllister on
the job for Phi Kappa Psi.
Team Two took a closer engagement
from Phi Chi, 7 to 8 telling the tale.
Sequoia cut off a Chi Psi rally in the
first frame by a big-league double play,
executed by the Sequoia second sacker,
unassisted, and the Chi Psis never
seemed to recover their lire. Morrison
and Settee made up the Sequoia battery,
with Wallace and Ankele working for
the losers.
Three and one-half innings proved
the superiority of Breakers over Alpha
Chi Sigma, the game being called with
the chemists on the short end of 16 to 7.
Breakers got only six safe hits, while
Bailard refused to allow Alpha Chi
Sigma a solitary blow.
Delta Kappa Epsilon continued its
â€¢losing streak by dropping a game to
Alpha Lambda, 7 to 4. Howe
and Van Bebber formed the Alpha
Kappa Lambda battery, with Howard
and Wheat on duty for Delta Kappa
Epsilon.
El Capitan had little trouble in bury
ing Alpha Tail Omega under a 15 to 5
score. Edwards, catching for Alpha
fau Omega, cut down several men at
second with his cannon-ball peg, but
was unable to win the game. His bat
terymate was Taylor. Lindersmith and
Ferrin started for El Capitan.
The main difficulty in intramural base
ball at present is the lack of suitable
playing fields. There is an excellent dia
mond near Sequoia Hall, but the others
are marred by trees, telephone poles,
paths, ditches, and other natural haz
ards. This situation will be improved
with the close of the University baseball
season, when the Freshman and Varsity
fields will be taken over for intramural
use. Until ibis time the teams will be
under a disadvantage, which might be
overcome by playing games in the early
morning, when either of the regular
fields may be used. Teams wishing to
do this should make arrangements with
Mr. Botsford, at the Gymnasium.
