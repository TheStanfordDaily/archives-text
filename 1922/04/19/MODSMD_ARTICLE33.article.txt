tional government reflect their prin- |
ciples. An outstanding example of this j
fact is the theocratic governments of i
the ancients, which is an outgrowth of
the Religious category.
The speaker traced political history
down through the ages, bringing out the
principles set forth by the most out
standing political thinkers of the past
centuries down to the present era, Plato,
Aristotle, Confucius, Macchiavelli,
Locke, llobbs. and Montesquiew, and
their relative holding to the theories of
one of these three human categories.
He also brought out the manner in
which modern political movements are
tlie result of an emancipation from me
dieval theocracy to naturalism, and
showed the change which has come
about in politics, whereby the absolute
sovereignty of the people has replaced
the ancient theory of the absolute sov
ereignty of God.
The series will be continued today,
tomorrow, and Friday. These lectures
will be delivered at 7:30 each evening
in the Little Theater.
In spite of the general attempt to
establish the principle that the under
lying category of human relationship is
an economic one, a careful study of
human problems will discover the fact
that the economic category runs into the
political, the political into the philo
sophical. and the philosophical may be
traced to the religious.
Such was the explanation with which
Professor Irving Babbitt, of Harvard
University, began liis lecture on "The
Types of Political Thinking in Their
Relation to Ethics," which he delivered
last evening, as the t'irst of a series of
four such lectures under the West Me
morial Foundation.
Professor Babbitt developed his
theme by bringing out the three great
categories of human experience as they
may be traced in history, and showed
the gradual transition from one to an
other in periods of the world's progress.
These categories, as stated by the lec
turer, are Humanistic, Naturalistic, and
Religious.
