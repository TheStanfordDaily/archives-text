# FIRE IS UNCONQUERED ENEMY, SAYS SHIVELY
## Authority on Fire Prevention Speaks on Elimination of waste of Life and Property 
### 
Co-ordination of eye and hand, to
see and eliminate fire hazards are
the important factors in combating
"America's unconquered enemy," ac
cording to J. H. Shively, authority on
fire prevention, in his address before
a student body assembly this morning.
"Property loss from fire in the
United States in 1920 amounted to
five hundred billions," said Schively
in pointing out the enormous waste
due to fire. "Property destroyed in
this way can not be replaced. In
surance companies can return the
money value but they cannot recreate
the property. Such a loss represents
1500 fires a day or more than a fire
a minute."
The establishment of national Fire
Prevention Days and state Fire Pre
ventions Weeks is evidence of the
awakening of the people to the im
portance of overcoming fire waste and
the importance of fire prevention.
According to Schively it is the develop
ment of individual responsibilty which
will prove the most effective weapon
against fires resulting from careless
ness.
"Ninety-five out of. every hundred
fires occur through some negligence
or indifference," said Schively. " 'Let
George do it,' is the universal atti
tude which is responsible for the ex
isting waste. Over one million dollars
of the fire loss is the result of the
mishandling of electric appliances and
nearly the same sum is lost through
the careless disposition of cigarettes,
cigars or matches."
Schively emphasized especially the
danger of the use of gasoline near
flames or inflamable substance. "Gaso
line is more dangerous than dynamite
because of the highly explosive nature
of its fumes," he pointed out. Schi
vely cited a number of cases where
complete destruction of buildings and
loss of life has resulted from the care
less disposal of matches or cigarettes,
and open fireplaces, using slides to
illustrate the many ways in which
fire may be caused and enumerated
the precautions which may be used
to prevent them. Shively urged the
co-operation of the entire campus with
the University Fire Department in its
endeavors to try "prevention before
cure."
