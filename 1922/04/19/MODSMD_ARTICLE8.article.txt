Exactly twenty-nine years ago to the
month some forty pioneer athletes
representing the Cardinal and the
Blue and Gold en'gaged in the first
Big Meet. The result was hardly
pleasing to Stanford adherents, for it
is a matter of record that the Bruins
trampled all over the Cardinal hope
fuls, 91 to 35.
Since that time, there has been a
Big Meet every year, with the excep
tion of 1906, the year of the earth
quake. Of the twenty-eight meets,
California has won fifteen, and Stan
ford twelve, with one tie. The Blue
and Gold also holds the record for
successive victories, from 1893 to
1903, Stanford cinder path hopes drop
ping every meet with the exception of
one tie during that period. From 1913
to 1920, however, the affair was noth
ing more than a Cardinal promenade,
of its own. With an original outlay
of $4,000, instruments were bought
for the thirty-five members and for
six years now. the San Francisco fire
men-musicians have been playing at
department exhibitions and for charity
affairs. They consented to come here
in the interests of the local fire fight
ers, who are in need of additional ap
paratus and equipment in the fire
house which the University at present
is unable to purchase.
In addition to the band, a program
has been arranged which includes tho
cleverest of campus talent. Ted
Merts and Louis Alabaster will be
heard on the Saxaphones in a group
of the latest end most popular songs.
Arnold Bayley will do something new
with his •sureatile vocal chords in his
monologue, "Vox Humana." A song
and dance number by Lester Seib, a
battle royal, and Ram's Head Society's
"Roscoe's Revenge or the Underworld
Slime," will provide entertainment
that makes one forget the worries of
pending examinations and A. B.'s cum
laude. Hollis Chalmers, Bill Shiels,
' Nip" McHose, Arnold Bayley, Paul
Claflin and others make up the cast
of the Ram's Head movie travesty.
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb will open the
program with an explanation of what
the firemen have done and expect to
do with the additional funds which
are secured by voluntary contributions
from campus residents and from the
proceeds of the cabaret tonight.
The program will start promptly at
8 o'clock.

Exactly twenty-nine years ago to the
month some forty pioneer athletes
representing the Cardinal and the
Blue and Gold en'gaged in the first
Big Meet. The result was hardly
pleasing to Stanford adherents, for it
is a matter of record that the Bruins
trampled all over the Cardinal hope
fuls, 91 to 35.
Since that time, there has been a
Big Meet every year, with the excep
tion of 1906, the year of the earth
quake. Of the twenty-eight meets,
California has won fifteen, and Stan
ford twelve, with one tie. The Blue
and Gold also holds the record for
successive victories, from 1893 to
1903, Stanford cinder path hopes drop
ping every meet with the exception of
one tie during that period. From 1913
to 1920, however, the affair was noth
ing more than a Cardinal promenade,
of its own. With an original outlay
of $4,000, instruments were bought
for the thirty-five members and for
six years now. the San Francisco fire
men-musicians have been playing at
department exhibitions and for charity
affairs. They consented to come here
in the interests of the local fire fight
ers, who are in need of additional ap
paratus and equipment in the fire
house which the University at present
is unable to purchase.
In addition to the band, a program
has been arranged which includes tho
cleverest of campus talent. Ted
Merts and Louis Alabaster will be
heard on the Saxaphones in a group
of the latest end most popular songs.
Arnold Bayley will do something new
with his •sureatile vocal chords in his
monologue, "Vox Humana." A song
and dance number by Lester Seib, a
battle royal, and Ram's Head Society's
"Roscoe's Revenge or the Underworld
Slime," will provide entertainment
that makes one forget the worries of
pending examinations and A. B.'s cum
