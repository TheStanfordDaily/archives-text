# RADIO PRESS SERVICE PLANNED FOR PACIFIC COAST UNIVERSITIES
## Karl King, University of Utah, Elected Association Head at Close of Sessions Here 
### 
Wireless service between the colleges
of the Pacific Coast and those of the
Rocky Mountain states will be put in as
soon as possible. This was decided at
the last meeting of the Press Confer
ence held here from last Monday until
yesterday.
The Western Intercollegiate Press
Association was formed for the pur
pose of bringing the papers and mag
azines into closer contact throughout
the West and with an idea of making an
exchange of ideas from the several cam
puses. When the wireless communica
tion is put in, it will simplify matters
by making it easy to have the news of
one campus on any other of the associa
tion in the course of a couple of hours.
The using of the journalistic societies
to back the various publications took
up most of the morning session. Stan
ford has more societies in immediate re
lation to its publications than any other
of the colleges of the West. From the
discussion it was proved that the esprit
de corps built up through having some
sort of a social organization behind a
publication is of great help to the pub
lication from the standpoint of securing
material and also to help in time of
financial need. Some of the colleges are
just starting humorous publications and
these found in the Chaparral some ex
cellent ideas for the production of a
successful comic.
The constitution of the Association,
which provided for officers without re
gard to their being all in one college,
was suspended until the time of the
joint convention, which is to be held, if
possible, with the Pacific Intercollegiatc
Press Association in October at the Uni
versity of California. If possible, the
combination of the Pacific Intercolle
giate Press Association, Western Inter
collegiate Press Association, and South
western Intercollegiate Press Associa
tion will be made. These three asso
ciations cover all the territory west of
the Rockies and it is the desire of all
to put the three into one centrally gov
erned group.
Karl King, business manager of the
Utah Chronicle, was elected president
of the Association for the coming year
and will be in charge of bringing about
the affiliation with the Pacific Intercol
legiate Press Association. R.| L. Alder,
business manager of the Humbug, the
Utah humorous magazine, was elected
secretary. W. D. Porter, editor of the
Utah Agricultural Student Life, was
secretary of the convention and is in
charge of publishing the minutes.
Delegates in attendance were: Espey
and Gustafson of Redlands, Jones of
Pomona, Huggard of Brigham Young
University, Utah, Dodsworth of Colo
rado Agricultural College, Coons of the
Daily California!), Porter and Merrill of
the Utah Agricultural College, King anil
Alder of the Utah Chronicle and Utah
Humbug. The Stanford representatives
consisted of the editors and managers
of all the publications.

and will be in charge of bringing about
the affiliation with the Pacific Intercol
legiate Press Association. R.| L. Alder,
business manager of the Humbug, the
Utah humorous magazine, was elected
secretary. W. D. Porter, editor of the
Utah Agricultural Student Life, was
secretary of the convention and is in
charge of publishing the minutes.
Delegates in attendance were: Espey
and Gustafson of Redlands, Jones of
Pomona, Huggard of Brigham Young
University, Utah, Dodsworth of Colo
rado Agricultural College, Coons of the
Daily California!), Porter and Merrill of
the Utah Agricultural College, King anil
Alder of the Utah Chronicle and Utah
Humbug. The Stanford representatives
consisted of the editors and managers
of all the publications.
Wireless service between the colleges
of the Pacific Coast and those of the
Rocky Mountain states will be put in as
soon as possible. This was decided at
the last meeting of the Press Confer
ence held here from last Monday until
yesterday.
The Western Intercollegiate Press
Association was formed for the pur
pose of bringing the papers and mag
azines into closer contact throughout
the West and with an idea of making an
exchange of ideas from the several cam
puses. When the wireless communica
tion is put in, it will simplify matters
by making it easy to have the news of
one campus on any other of the associa
tion in the course of a couple of hours.
The using of the journalistic societies
to back the various publications took
up most of the morning session. Stan
ford has more societies in immediate re
lation to its publications than any other
of the colleges of the West. From the
discussion it was proved that the esprit
de corps built up through having some
sort of a social organization behind a
publication is of great help to the pub
lication from the standpoint of securing
material and also to help in time of
financial need. Some of the colleges are
just starting humorous publications and
these found in the Chaparral some ex
cellent ideas for the production of a
successful comic.
The constitution of the Association,
which provided for officers without re
gard to their being all in one college,
was suspended until the time of the
joint convention, which is to be held, if
possible, with the Pacific Intercollegiatc
Press Association in October at the Uni
versity of California. If possible, the
combination of the Pacific Intercolle
giate Press Association, Western Inter
collegiate Press Association, and South
western Intercollegiate Press Associa
tion will be made. These three asso
ciations cover all the territory west of
the Rockies and it is the desire of all
to put the three into one centrally gov
erned group.
Karl King, business manager of the
Utah Chronicle, was elected president
of the Association for the coming year
and will be in charge of bringing about
the affiliation with the Pacific Intercol
legiate Press Association. R.| L. Alder,
