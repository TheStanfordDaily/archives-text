# RADIO PRESS SERVICE PLANNED FOR PACIFIC COAST UNIVERSITIES
## Karl King, University of Utah, Elected Association Head at Close of Sessions Here

Wireless service between the colleges
of the Pacific Coast and those of the

The Western Intercollegiate Press
Association was formed for the pur

by making it easy to have the news of
one campus on any other of the associa

The using of the journalistic societies
to back the various publications took

of the colleges of the West. From the
discussion it was proved that the esprit

financial need. Some of the colleges are
just starting humorous publications and
these found in the Chaparral some ex
cellent ideas for the production of a
successful comic.
The constitution of the Association,
which provided for officers without re

was suspended until the time of the
joint convention, which is to be held, if
possible, with the Pacific Intercollegiatc
