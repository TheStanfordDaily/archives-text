# ROUSSEAU AND BURKE COMPARED IN LECTURE
## 
### 
"In the battle between the spirit of
Rousseau and the spirit of Burke dur
ing the last century, Rousseau has in
the main triumphed," said Professor
Irving Babbitt of Harvard University
last night in his lecture on "Burke and
Rousseau" in the Little Theater. The
talk was the second of a series of four
which lie is giving under the auspices
of the West Memorial Foundation,
According to the doctrine of Burke,
it: is the imagination which really gov
erns. The state is an ethical unit —
awing -and commanding—he maintained.
In dread of the unimaginative revolu
tion and the forces bringing it on, Burke
came to fear the critical intellect as well,
and this resulted in a general attitude
of anti-intcllcctualism. He associated
his defense of moral imagination too
much with forms of the past, Professor
Babbitt believes.
Rousseau, Professor Babbitt showed,
is a strangely divided personality whose
sentences seem contradictory in differ
ent parts of the same book. His influ
ence has been felt along two lines: first,
as the author of democracy, and sec
ond, in the spirit of imperialism which
the Germans say they have made their
own by adopting his spirit.
The Rousseauistic dream of a state
of equality in which there exists abso
lute liberty and fraternity, assumes that
man is naturally good and is bad as a
result of bad institutions. "This results
in a monstrous state of the other ex
treme," said Professor Babbitt. The
doctrine that "the king can do no
no wrong" is here transferred to the
people, who are subject to no higher
power or control.
