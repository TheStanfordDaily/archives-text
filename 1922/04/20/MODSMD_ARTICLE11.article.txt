# Glide For Life Will Be Outdone At Encina Pool
## 
### 
Encina pool is to be put to a new
use. Rivaling A1 White's form in enter
ing the water, and unsurpassed by the
Dizzy Dip or any of the better thrillers.
Vanity Fair will present a life-size
chute-the-chutes, a thirty-five-foot slide
for life into F.ncina pool, with specially
constructed water-skimming boats and
a twenty-five-foot drop from the top of
the tower to the splash below. Every
boat will be manned by a competent
navigator, and is to be constructed on
scientific non-sinkable lines.
Members of Phi Gamma Delta, put
ting on the concession, have completed
plans which call for a thirty-five-foot
runway, a slide tower rising twenty-five
feet above the shallow end of the pool,
to be festooned with vary-colored lights.
A spotlight mounted on the diving plat
form will play upon the joy-riders as
their boat splashes into the water.
The plan of the boats, selected be

cause of the methods of securing com
plete stability, calls for a flat-bottomed
craft practically rectangular, with the
bottom curving sharply upward at the
bow. Safety-flange runners are to be
used on the runway, and a special block
and tackle system has been worked out
to convey the boats to the landing at
the top of the tower. Construction work
is to start on the shutcs Monday.
Man o' War's Wife, the winner of
the Brown Derby, the Wild Horse, cap
tured in a wild oat field, and other
successors of the steeds which once
roamed the Farm, are being transported
at great expense and tribulation to the
Carnival, by Sigma Chi, and will be on
display as part of the Horse Show at
Vanity Fair. Special stalls are to be
erected, and a solid steel loving cup
will be offered to the entry which, in
the opinion of the judges, comes near
est to perfection in horse flesh.
