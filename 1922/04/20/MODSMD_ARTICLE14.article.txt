# BLUE AND GOLD CREW TO MEET WASHINGTON ROWERS AT SEATTLE
## 
### 
The rowing classic of the Pacific Coast
will take place tomorrow afternoon when
the University of California crew battles
for honors with the crew from Univer
sity of Washington at Seattle, Wash
ington. The winner of this race will
represent the Pacific Coast in the inter
collegiate regatta at Poughkeepsie this
year.
California defeated the northern crew
last year by the scant margin of five
feet on the Oakland estuary in one of
the closest races ever seen on the Pa
cific Coast. The Washington stars arc
out to turn the tables on the Blue and
Gold boat this year and from prelim
inary dope will enter the contest with
the odds slightly in their favor.
Coach Ben Wallis of California start
ed the season with only three men back
for practice and has had to develop an
entirely new machine. Illness and in
juries have hindered the work of sev
eral of the best men in the first boat.
Coach Ed Leader of Washington was
fortunate in having the majority of the
1921 crew return and with some very
fine material from last year's second
varsity and freshman crews has built
up a formidable aggregation. Several
of the members of last year's varsity on
the Washington boat were not able to
hold their places, due to the wonderful
work that has been shown by several
members from the freshman eight of
1921. The 1921 freshman crew earned
the reputation from its showing at Oak
land last year of being one of the finest
first-year crows that has ever been de
veloped on the coast.
