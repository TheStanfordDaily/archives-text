# CARDINAL CHANCES DROP WHEN HOWELL GOES TO HOSPITAL
## Relapse from Weakness After 'Flu' Sends Jumper to Bed With Temperature of 102° 
### 
Popular opinion in the sporting wofld,
which had inclined towards Stanford
with Hutchinson and Van Sant, the
Bruin stars, incapacitated, swung back
to the Bears yesterday when it became
known that Mint Howell was in the
hospital with a fever of 102 degrees.
Howell, who had apparently recov
ered from a severe attack of influenza,
had been counted on to out-dual Muller
in the high jump. His last-minute ill
ness shifts three points from the Stan
ford column to that of the Blue and
Gold. >
"Dad" Moulton' was inclined to view
Howell's sickness rather optimistically
last night, assaying that the Cardinal
jumper wpuld be able to enter the irieet.
If his condition is at all improved Sat
urday, he will probably make the trip
to Berkeley, but his chances of besting
Muller and Treyer, in view of the fact
that he has lost fifteen pounds in the
past three weeks, are very slim.
Botli Jim Arthur, weightman, and
Linn Parish, javelin thrower, whose
names werfc omitted from the list «112
entries last night, will compete Satur
day, according to Tenipleton.
Porty-seven men have been entered in
the meet by Walt Christie. Of those
forty-seven, some dozen or fifteen will
bear the brunt of the point sc«ring.
Merchant and Muller are the "work
horses," each of them being entered in
four events. Muller will try his hand
at the javelin, along with the broad
jump, high jump, and discus.
Meanwhile, a great deal is being said,
and more imagined, concerning the
twenty-ninth annual track classic. The
athletes themselves, the most import
ant persons, are virtually marking time
waiting for Saturday, and trying to think
as little as possible about the affair.
The relay or the "breaks" will decidc
the winner, according to the majority
of those who profess to be acquainted
with the ins and outs of the intercol
legiate cindcr path. The relay itself,
thinks "Dink" Templeton, will be de
cided before it is every actually run. If
Williamson wins the quarter mile, the
relay will go to the Cardinal, and prob
ably the meet. If, however. McDonald
or Hendrixson beats the Stanford flyer,
the Bruins will likely annex the final
event.
Stanford holds the advantage in the 440
in the matter of positions on the track.
In that event, Williamson will get the
pole, giving him the edge over the rest
of the field. The triangular race be
tween Williamson, McDonald, and Hen
drixson, billed as the feature event of
the afternoon, will be decided in the final
100 yards. If the Stanford man can
pile up a big enough lead in the first
300 yards to withstand McDonald's ter
rific finish, lie will win.
Lute Nichols, graduate manager at
California, has announced that the mile,
the first track event on the program,
will start at 1 :30. The track itself and
infield will be carefully policed to see
that the competitors are not bothered
by any of the spectators crowding
about.
