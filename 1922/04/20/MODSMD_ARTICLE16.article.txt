# CARDINAL CHANCES DROP WHEN HOWELL GOES TO HOSPITAL
## Relapse from Weakness After 'Flu' Sends Jumper to Bed With Temperature of 102° 
### 
Popular opinion in the sporting wofld,
which had inclined towards Stanford
with Hutchinson and Van Sant, the
Bruin stars, incapacitated, swung back
to the Bears yesterday when it became
known that Mint Howell was in the
hospital with a fever of 102 degrees.
Howell, who had apparently recov
ered from a severe attack of influenza,
had been counted on to out-dual Muller
in the high jump. His last-minute ill
ness shifts three points from the Stan
ford column to that of the Blue and
Gold. >
"Dad" Moulton' was inclined to view
Howell's sickness rather optimistically
last night, assaying that the Cardinal
jumper wpuld be able to enter the irieet.
If his condition is at all improved Sat
urday, he will probably make the trip
to Berkeley, but his chances of besting
Muller and Treyer, in view of the fact
that he has lost fifteen pounds in the
past three weeks, are very slim.
Botli Jim Arthur, weightman, and
Linn Parish, javelin thrower, whose
names werfc omitted from the list «112
entries last night, will compete Satur
day, according to Tenipleton.
Porty-seven men have been entered in
the meet by Walt Christie. Of those
forty-seven, some dozen or fifteen will
bear the brunt of the point sc«ring.
Merchant and Muller are the "work
horses," each of them being entered in
four events. Muller will try his hand
at the javelin, along with the broad
jump, high jump, and discus.
Meanwhile, a great deal is being said,
and more imagined, concerning the
twenty-ninth annual track classic. The
athletes themselves, the most import
ant persons, are virtually marking time
waiting for Saturday, and trying to think
as little as possible about the affair.
The relay or the "breaks" will decidc
the winner, according to the majority
of those who profess to be acquainted
