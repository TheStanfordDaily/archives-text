# YOUTH MUST BE SERVED
## 
### 
The old story of youth against experience will be
enacted once again when California and Stanford
athletes compete on the track and field at Berkeley
Saturday. Walter Christie, for twenty-one years
leader of the Bears, is without doubt among the old
est if not the grandaddy of Coast Conference coaches,
while "Dink" Templeton of Stanford is the youngest
major sport mentor in the same group of universities.
Through his long reign Christie has on the whole
been successful, though Stanford annexed a seven
straight string of victories from 1913 to 1919. Chris
tie has taken his share of wins, and has produced ath
letes who will long be remembered.
The Board of Athletic Control appointed Temple
ton, who was then a student, head track coach for the
1921 season when Stanford's track power was at its
lowest ebb. Some questioned the wisdom of the
Board in naming a youngster, but Templeton has re
builded the Cardinal strength in an unbelievable de
gree with his single year of service.
Next Saturday Stanford's youngest and Califor
nia's oldest will dope the events, estimate competi
tors, and match wits for points. There is a great deal
more to winning races than natural ability. Form,
attitude, the way the race is run, and the arrange
ment of entries, suggest just a few of the problems
for which the coach is responsible.
It will be interesting to notice which coach has
his athletes in best condition, which has the greatest
number of unexpected come-through performances,
and whose men show the greatest skill and general
ship in handling their events.
L&st year Hartranft was a mediocre weight man.
Last year Stanford had no quarter-milers, yet Kenny
Wright ran away from Mac Donald. YVe had no
4>ole-vaulters, but Black tied Norris. This year Tem
pleton had no half-milers. Now he has three, and
â€¢his squad is no larger than before. Christie had no
high-jumper, but rumors have it that he has uncov
ered a real one this last week. There is a great deal
more to coaching a track squad than watching the
candidates work out. It will be more than interesting
to see how Templeton and Christie stack up as strate
gists, developers of new material, and as builders of
spirit. And if the Stanford gang has really caught
the competitive stubbornness of its leader. Califor
nia's oldest mentor's prediction of an easy victory
should not prove altogether accurate.
