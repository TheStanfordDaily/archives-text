# JUST A REMINDER

### 
Several hundred who are going to the Big Meet
have not bought tickets. The sections cannot he ar
ranged satisfactorily unless the sales are made in
advance. Why not get your ticket today and make it
easier for all concerned next Saturday. And by the
way, have you your reservation for "Penrod" at the
Alcazar on Saturday night? The show is our enter
prise and the profits go directly to our use.
