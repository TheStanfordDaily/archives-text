After considerable mental turmoil we have decided
to conduct a Short Course In Campus Humor. This will
be free of charge (if we're lucky).
• * *
Rule No. 1. —All campus jokes must under all circum
stances be confined to the following subjects:
a. Co-eds.
b. Women's clothes.
c. Liquor.
d. The faculty.
* * •
Rule 2.—As long as the joke is on one of the above
subjects, it is not necessary that there be any particular
point to it. For instnace:
ECON: —Have you ever seen a co-ed smoke?
ENGINEER: —No, but I've seen some pretty hot ones
This is an example of Rule 1-a. We defy any reader
to find anything to laugh at in that, but the editor
printed it. If we can get away with it you can.
* * •
Rule No. 3.—lf you are good at limericks, write some
thing like this:
There was a collegian from Bath,
Whose dimensions were those of a lath.
He conquered with ease
A lawyers degrees,
But was always a dumbell at math.
and throw it in the waste basket. Now write one like
this:
There was a young medic from Troy,
Whose prescriptions were always a joy.
But he changed his ethyl
To a low grade of methyl
And laid out three men and a boy.
and light a cigarette with it.
♦ * *
Anyone following carefully all of the above direc
tions and fails to get anything accepted is perfectly
normal.
* • •
We have found a team-mate for the yokel that asked
for an Eskimo Pie a la mode —the boy who asked for
a choc malt ice cream cone.
» * *
Heloise, please understand that just because the
"Flying Dutchman," is an imaginary ship, it isn't neces
sarily a fairy boat.
♦ * •
Hennery says that when he buys that new furnace he
thinks he'll get one of these hear British Thermal Units
he's been reading about.

"I will never leave you!" he whispered.
"Not even your life insurance." she cooed.
• * *
He said he worked in the Business Office. I asked
him why he wasn't in hell. He said, "And why should
I be in hell, you shrimp?" And I said "Because that's
where business has gone," and he said "Why don't you
take up Econ?"
* * *
The physics prof says he can't work problems of
density in his head.

A Little Poem From the Ancient Chinese

Along came Cliooey-chooey.
Chooey-chooey go tooey-tooey.
Fooey.fooey no hear chooey-choey go tooey-tooey.
Gooey!

No, Ambrosia, Tuskegee Institute's participation in a
track meet doesn't make it dark meat.

Where 1 came from, the track team is so good that
they use a vaulting pole for a relay baton.
