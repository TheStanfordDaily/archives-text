Ijt is somewhat unfortunate that
criticism of the New Union should be
gin before it has fairly gotten under
way; but it is the writer's belief that
frank expressions of student sentiment
will aid the management in the solu
tion of its problems. Moreover, great
many students find that the eating
situation has become almost intoler
able, for economic reasons. The need
for relief is immediate.
There is a large body of students
who for various reasons find it im
possible or undesirable to eat on the
Club or monthly plan. These stu
dents had long been awaiting the open
ing of the New Union, in the hope
that there they would be able to se
cure decent meals at comparatively
low cost. The result has been a rather
bitter disappointment. The dining
hall a la carte as conducted at present
is an economic impossibility for most
of us. We are worse off than formerly.
Our only remedy is to eat in Pally—
and that is what most of us are do
ing at present, as a matter of neces
sity.
If anyone wishes to estimate how
much patronage the New Union has
lost already, it is only necessary for
him to visit the Pally restaurants at
meal hours, crowded with students
prefering to walk two miles rather than
pay the exorbitant Com
ments from all sides —even from mem
bers of the faculty, leave no doubt
as to the unfavorable impression the
management is creating. The inevit
able result will be failure and disaster.
In many institutions a boycott would
immediately be organized under con
ditions similar to these.
In fairness, it should be said that
those who eat 011 the monthly plan
have no cause for camplain; but the
impression is gaining ground that the
public dining-hall is being made to
pay partly for what the clubs eat. If
this is true, it does not impress us
either as good business or as a square
deal; if it is not true, we remain at
a loss in understanding the necessity
for the high charges.
The average student likes a certain
freedom of choice as to whot he wish
es to eat and how much he cares to
spend for each meal. This explains
the popularity of the cafeteria style
of service, indicated by the large
numbers who patronized the old Inn in
spite of its disagreeable feature. Sure
ly some attempt should be made to
consult the preference of those for
whose benefit the New Union was
supposedly designed. The most im
perative need on the Stanford campus
is a reduction in the cost of living,
to neutralize as far as possible the
financial burdens imposed by increased
tuition.
The writer feels certain that he has
freedom of choice as to what he wish
opinion, but the sentiment of a great
many students. A statement from the
management as to any plans for reliev
ing the situation would be greatly ap
preciated by all of us.
