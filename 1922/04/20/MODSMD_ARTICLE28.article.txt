posed amendment to the state constitu
tion providing for a so-called Water
and Power Act should be defeated."

two to one decision, while the negative
squad was also suffering defeat in San
Francisco.
Although the Nestorians did not suc
ceed in defeating St. Ignatius at Stan
ford, the debate was closely contested,
as the two to one ballot indicates. The
affirmative Nestoria team attempted to
prove that the proposed act was an un
tried experiment and would not accom
plish the purposes for which it has been
instituted. It was further pointed out
that due to the large number of private
power corporations that would have to
be bought out, the would bring un
necessary expense on the public.

affirmative's arguments, demonstrated
the success of similar laws in other sec
tions of the country, and showed that
the act was both necessary and advan
tageous. Heckling of the speakers by
members of the opposing team was an
interesting feature of the debate.
The St. Ignatius team was composed
of Edward Keil, Charles Ruggles, and
Gerald O'Gara, while DeWitt Webb,
'24, Horace Dryden. '24, and Homer
Brown, '22, made up the Nestoria
