### 
Twenty cases of books, containing
over four thousand volumes, have just
arrived at the library, coming direct
from Paris by way of the Panama
Canal. The private library of Fran
cois Picavet, professor in the College
of France, and a well-known philo
sophical writer, forms the larger part
of the shipment. This collection is
rich in material relating to medieval
philosophy and literature.
