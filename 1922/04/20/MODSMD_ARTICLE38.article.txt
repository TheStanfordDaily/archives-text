THE RUSSO-GERMAN
AGREEMENT
The incident of the Russo-German
agreement is by no means closed. It
stUl dominates the situation; the Con
ference seems to be held up pending
its settlement. Lloyd George and
Rathenau held an inconclusive confer
ence yesterday. The propagandists on
both sides are arguing as to whether
the British were or were not notified
of the treaty before its signature. It
is obvious that, much as they would
like to the Powers cannot of their
own right annul a treaty made between
Germany and Russia. They are bring
ing pressure upon Germany to induce
her to denounce it, but it seems that
Russia is going to stand by her new
friend. If Germany is excluded from
the committee on Russian affairs,
Russia may withdraw, leaving the
other delegates in the position of the
coroner's jury which was disappointed
to find that the corpse had walked off
and left them nothing to do.
The significance of the treaty is not
so mucu that it brings underhanded
methods of diplomacy into the pure
air of Genoa, for the air was already
quite murkv, nor that it destroys the
plans laid by rhe French to have the
Russian share of German reparations
handed over to them, nor even that
it takes out of the hands of the Con
ference many questions it was meet
ing to decide, but rather that it threat
ens Europe with a new alliance â€”a
combination that can muster more men
than France with all her Continental
friends can put in the field. England
is thus placed again in her old position,
holding the balance of power.
Germany has shown herself very
obstinate in the matter of reparations
due to France, and has declared her
self unable to pay her next install
ment. The French may also have to
meet the subtle argument suggested
by Lloyd George before he left Lon
don: that if war-impoverished Germany
can pay regardless of her exhaustion,
perhaps war-impoverished France can
do a little toward paying the interest
on the debt she owes Britain. French
journals are again discussing an in
vasion of Germany.
There is one great hope for France:
that the action of Germany may be so
widely resented that France may re
gain her moral position as the oppon
ent of a powerful and unscrupulous
enemy. It may also dawn upon the
world that if the political provisions
of the Treaty of Versailles are to be
rewritten, they can only be rewritten
in blood. Such considerations may
prevent the isolation which would re
sult for France if England should de
sert her in the face of such a hostile
coalition as that of Germany and Rus
sia. The Russo-German agreement,
marking as it does the beginning of
a new cycle in European diplomacy,
may be as far reaching in its import
ance as the Treaty of Versailles.
