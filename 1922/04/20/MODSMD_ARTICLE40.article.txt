OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, April 20. (P.I.N.S.) â€”The first
"Travel On Party" offered by the co
eds at O. A. C., instead of the annual
stunt show, proved to be a knockout.
The men were forced to walk ladders,
dive through auto tires, explore subter
ranean depths of sorority basements,
and sneak through ranks of ghdstly
dress forms.
