UNIVERSITY OF OREGON, Eu
gene, April 20. (P.I.N.S.) â€”Everything
from medieval knight to the twentieth
century football player was in evidence
at the annual April Frolic, the only ex
clusively women's, entirely "manless"
student affair of the year, last week-end.
An animated basket of poinsettas was
awarded first prize as the best indi
vidual costume of the evening, while the
second prize was awarded to a co-ed
who impersonated a Flap-Jack. Stunts
by the various women's organizations
and a dance comprised the program.
