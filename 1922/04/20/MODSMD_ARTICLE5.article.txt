# RIVAL NINES PREPARE FOR CRISIS OF SERIES
## 
### 
Preparing to show all their strength
against California, Saturday afternoon,
the members of the varsity baseball
nine are perfecting their attack and
defense to that this year's series may
go to Stanford. Coach Seay is hav
ing infield and batting practice every
afternoon, and the whole team is
working together to achieve what,
three weeks ago, would have been
pronounced an impossibility—the de
feat of California's heavy-hitting,
smooth-fielding team.
From every indication, this next
game will be the hardest fought of
the series, and when last Saturday's
contest is taken into consideration, it
can be seen that that statement means
a good deal. California, doped from
the beginning to win, is bound to show
all the strength possible to avoid be
ing beaten when the odds were so
much in its favor. Captain Green and
his team-mates, on the other hand,
have the opportunity to spring the
surprise of the athletic season. They
were within three outs of doing so last
Saturday, and there is a good chance
that they will finish the job this week
end.
California's improvement over their
showing in the first game was to be
expected. They entered the second
fracas with their self-confidence
shaken, and determined to take ilo
chances. The return of Hermele, star
first-sacker, helped the Blue and Gold
to a great extent. Hermele can catch
almost anything that is thrown to
first base, and he is besides a demon
batter. He was captain of his fresh
man nine two years ago. Thompson,
California's heavy-hitting catcher, will
be present again to menace the horse
hide. During the two games this
season he has landed on the sphere
for seven hits, including a triple and
two doubles.
The heavy hitting on the Cardinal
varsity is being done by Captain Green
and Parker, both of these men batting
well up in the .300 division. The
team as a whole has shown an in
crease in batting fever over the early
part of the season, and has gathered
eighteen hits off Morrow in the two
games of the series. Both nines have
been hitting with regularity, but the
brand of defense put up, especially by
Stanford's infield, has kept the score
down in both contests.
