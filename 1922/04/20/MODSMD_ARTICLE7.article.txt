# DAY DEVOTED TO FIREMEN CLOSED BY PAVILION SHOW
## Program Crystallizes Support For Campus Fire Fighters; Visiting Band Entertained 
### 
Stanford belonged to the firemen yes
terday. They took possession when J.
H. Schively,spoke at the Fire Preven
tion Assembly and returned the keys
when the San Francisco Fire Depart
ment band left the campus in a special
bus following the entertainment in the
Pavilion last evening.
A busy week had its effect upon the
cabaret attendance, but, although the
crowd was not particularly large, num
bers by the best of campus talent were
received with enthusiasm. Financially,
the proceeds little more than equaled
the expenses, but, according to H. B.
Rorke, '24, who headed the Firemen's
Fund committee, the sentiment,created
in support of the Stanford Fire De
partment by the day's activities will pro
vide incentive for later assistance. More
than $150 has already been received
in voluntary contributions from campus
residents.
Arnold Bayley, '23, delighted the
roughs at the Pavilion with his imper
sonations of prominent campus figures
and stray bits from campus drama'tics.
Ted Mertz, '23. and Louis Alabaster,
'24, with M. O. Grinstead at the piano,
won repeated encores with their popular
saxaphone numbers.
A burlesque movie production of the
underworld, written by Carl Shoup,, '24,
was the contribution of Ram's Head
Society, which the best campus com
edians made ludicrously amusing. Ar
nold Bayley was the heroic hero, Bill
Shiels, '22. the villainous villain, Paul
Claflin, '22. the lovely lady, Mollis Chal
mers, '22, the director. Nip McHose,
'24. the cameraman, and Sam Menden
hall, '24, the atmosphere.
An innovation was provided in the
free-for-all gloved scramble for a
marked dollar. It was won by Sam
Hayes. '22.
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb opened the
program with an explanation of how
the funds being raised for the fire fight
ers will be used and the seriousness of
the fire menace on the campus.
Throughout the evening the San Fran
cisco Fire Department Band of thirty
pieces, led by Thomas Kennedy, played
popular music.
Other events in the day's program
were the parade in Palo Alto yesterday
morning, selections by the visiting band
in the new Union Court at 4 o'clock,
and a special organ recital for the vis
itors by Warren I). Allen in Memorial
Church.
