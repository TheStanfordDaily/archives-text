# HUGH H. BROWN TO DISCUSS AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION
## 
### 
Hugh IT. Brown, '96, a loader of the
bar in the state of Nevada, will give an
address on the American Bar Associa
tion on Friday, April 21, at 3:15. in
Room 12 of the Law School.
Brown will discuss the work of the
state commissioners on Union State
Laws. As a representative of Nevada,
he is a member of that commission,
which is composed of lawyers, one ap
pointed by each state, who meet every
year for the purpose of working out
methods of unifying various state laws.
The present uniform laws on commer
cial paper are the work of this com
mission. It is now examining the ques
tion of divorce laws, though most of
its work is of commercial nature.
