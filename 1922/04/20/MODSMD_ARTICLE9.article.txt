# FIRST GRIDIRON CONTEST WILL BE PLAYED ON MAY 6
## Eight Stanford Teams to Be Matched in Games Which Will End Football Season 
### 
bootball enthusiasts will be given their
first glompse of the 1922 football squad
in action on May 6, according to plans
that are now being formed. On that
date eight teams, matched as evenly as
possible, will meet in the Stanford Sta
dium in violent combat.
Every man on the Stanford squad
will be given a chance to play. Two
teams will be pitted against each other
for one fifteen-minute quarter; at the
start of the next quarter two fresh
teams will take the field.
Spectators are thus assured of plenty
of action during the entire day. Inten
sive training was immediately begun
after announcement of the game.
The date has not been definitely set
as May 6, because practice may be ex
tended another week if "Pop" Warner
and C. E. Thornhill thinks that the men
are still getting benefit from it at the
end of the five weeks.
Tomorrow afternoon there will be a
short scrimmage in order to illustrate
some few simple plays. Heavy equip
ment is in demand by most of the
candidates, in preparation for tackling,
running punts, and scrimmages, which
will form a large part of the training
from now on.
A squad of seventy men is reporting
every afternoon for work, and Warner
is well pleased with the showing made
by the men. Big men are in demand,
and the coaches wish to emphasize that
it is not yet too late for a husky man
to get out and learn the rudiments of
the game.
