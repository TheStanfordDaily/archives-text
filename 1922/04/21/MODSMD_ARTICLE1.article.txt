# NEITHER TEAM HAS EDGE IN MEET CARD BABES WIN BASEBALL SERIES
## Kallam's Sluggers Batter Cub Hurlers For 11-3 Victory 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Coach Floyd Kallam's freshman baseball team made history yesterday by de
feating the California yearlings 11-3 in the deciding game of the series. In win
ning the series, the 1925 diamond squad did something that no other Cardinal
freshman team has done in the past.
One of the biggest factors in the Card yearlings' victory yesterdey was the
pitching and hitting of Milton Teague, the little right-hander. With the exception
of one inning when he wobbled, Teague pitched superb ball and had the Bear cubs
eating out of fiis hand. By driving in four runs with a single and a double and
scoring one run himself he completed a very creditable performance.
The Card babes started after O'Rouke, the cub pitcher, in the second inning,
scoring three runs on a walk, two errors, and two hits. O'Roiflke wobbled again in

the second and was replaced by Kelly
when a hit, a walk, and a wild pitch re
sulted in another run. Kelly was treated
in the same way, and hits by Jim Lawson
and Follansbee resulted in another run
before the Stanford babes were retired.
The Card babes scored again in the
sixth when McCandless singled and came
home on Mulchay's triple. The eighth
inning was a slugfest for Kallam's men.
Jim Lawson, first man up, singled. Mc-
Candless was safe and Lawson went to
second when the cub shortstop booted an
easy grounder. Follansbee walked, till
ing the bases. Teague cleared the bases
with his second hit of the day, a long
double to the left field fence, and ad
vanced to third on Mulchay's sacrifice
hit. Roberts grounded out. Cuddeback'
singled, scoring Teague, and came home
a minute later on Dick Lawson's triple.
Johnston flied out, ending the inning.
The Blue and Gold yearlings looked
dangerous only once —in the fourth
inning when an error and four successive
singles netted them their only runs of
the game.
The Cardinal freshmen secured eleven
bingles off the two opposing pitchers,
Cuddeback, Jim Lawson, McCandless,
and Teague getting two each, while Mul
ehay and Dick Lawson got triples. The
Bear cubs got but seven hits off Teague,
and eight of them were retired via the
strike-out route.
The Card babes played excellent ball
in the field and not a costly error was
chalked up against them, while the Cali
fornia freshmen made seven errors.
Manouk handled the indicator.

Coach Floyd Kallam's freshman baseball team made history yesterday by de
feating the California yearlings 11-3 in the deciding game of the series. In win
ning the series, the 1925 diamond squad did something that no other Cardinal
freshman team has done in the past.
One of the biggest factors in the Card yearlings' victory yesterdey was the
pitching and hitting of Milton Teague, the little right-hander. With the exception
of one inning when he wobbled, Teague pitched superb ball and had the Bear cubs
eating out of fiis hand. By driving in four runs with a single and a double and
scoring one run himself he completed a very creditable performance.
The Card babes started after O'Rouke, the cub pitcher, in the second inning,
scoring three runs on a walk, two errors, and two hits. O'Roiflke wobbled again in

the second and was replaced by Kelly
when a hit, a walk, and a wild pitch re
sulted in another run. Kelly was treated
in the same way, and hits by Jim Lawson
and Follansbee resulted in another run
before the Stanford babes were retired.
The Card babes scored again in the
sixth when McCandless singled and came
home on Mulchay's triple. The eighth
inning was a slugfest for Kallam's men.
Jim Lawson, first man up, singled. Mc-
Candless was safe and Lawson went to
second when the cub shortstop booted an
easy grounder. Follansbee walked, till
ing the bases. Teague cleared the bases
with his second hit of the day, a long
double to the left field fence, and ad
vanced to third on Mulchay's sacrifice
hit. Roberts grounded out. Cuddeback'
singled, scoring Teague, and came home
a minute later on Dick Lawson's triple.
Johnston flied out, ending the inning.
The Blue and Gold yearlings looked
dangerous only once —in the fourth
inning when an error and four successive
singles netted them their only runs of
the game.
The Cardinal freshmen secured eleven
bingles off the two opposing pitchers,
Cuddeback, Jim Lawson, McCandless,
and Teague getting two each, while Mul
ehay and Dick Lawson got triples. The
Bear cubs got but seven hits off Teague,
and eight of them were retired via the
strike-out route.
The Card babes played excellent ball
in the field and not a costly error was
chalked up against them, while the Cali
fornia freshmen made seven errors.
