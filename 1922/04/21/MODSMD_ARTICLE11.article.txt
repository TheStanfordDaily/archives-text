# OUTCOME OF MEET LIES IN THIRD PLACES
## 
### 
Seldom has there been such a collec
tion of stars gathered together in one
meet. Hartranl't, the "wonder athlete,"
Kjrksey, "second fastest human," Hau
lier. leading javelin thrower, Falk, a bet
ter than ordinary hurdler, Wilcox and
Norris in the pole vault, Muller in the
high jump, Williamson, Hendrixson, and
McDonald in the quarter—these are some
of the athletes that are attracting the
public interest.
Every event will be closely contested
even to third place, for it is the three
ami one-point places that will decide.
The entries and their chances in the
events follow :
MILE RUN
The Bruins start the afternoon with
nine points. Fiskc, Denton, and Kitts
should all finish in about 4:30 minutes.
Eddlcman and Elliott, who are in poor
condition, have little chance of placing, i
440-YARD DASH
If Williamson can stave off McDon
ald's finish, he ought to break the tape in
about 50 seconds flat. Hendrixson, al
though a great competition runner, seems
. to he relegated to third place. Judah of

the Cardinal may take third.
120 HIGH HURDLES
Henderson, of the Bruins, is consistent
if nothing else, but his best time is 15 4-5
seconds. Falk is doped to win rather
easily in about 15 2-5 seconds, with
Hayes of Stanford pushing Henderson
for Second.
100-YARD DASH
The points should begin to roll to the
Cardinal side of the scoreboard with this
event. Kirksey, with his training last
summer and this spring, should win, un
less his leg goes back on him. Even at
that he has an even chance to beat
Hutchison. Sudden, the young Cardinal
dash man, is in great condition, and is
countcd on for second, or possibly first,
in case Kirksey fails to win.
880-YARD RUN
This cace will "make or break" the
Stanford chances. Scofield of Stanford
has done the best time. He and Daly,
his teammate, look to be the best. Bau
man and Pearce of the Bruins have run
close to two minutes. Macintosh may
surprise with a first or second.
TWO MILE RUN
Watch Myers, the blond Stanford two
miler. Dorr, the Bruin record holder,
is conceded first, but Myers will pass
Knowlton, the second man. Dorr may
break his mark of 9:47 minutes, made at
Stanford last year.
220-YARD LOW HURDLES
With Van Sant out, the Cardinal may
make a clean sweep, with Falk first in
about :24 1-5. Both Hayes and Gene
Davis, who won sixteen points in the
California meet three years ago, have
made better time than Neff of the Bears.
220-YARD DASH
If Kirksey can make the grade in the

100, he should also win in the 220, with
Sudden close behind. Hutchison may be
beaten by Comstock or Hartranft, pro
vided the latter enters.
RELAY
California's quartet of Saxby, Hen
derson, Hendrixson, and McDonald hold
the edge over the Cardinal team, if it con
sists of Wright, Judah, Clarke, and Wil
liamson. A different aspect would be
put on things if Sudden runs, but he will
be tired from the 220, which immediately
precedes the relay. The winner's time
should come close to the record of 3 :21
minutes.

POLE VAULT
.Wilcox is in better shape than he ever
lias been for a Big Meet. He has done
12 feet 6 several times, but so have Nor
ris and Graham of California. Three
points apiece seems to be a fair division.
Black, who tied for lirst last year, is clue
to break in on this triumvirate.
HIGH JUMP
On Mint Howell rests the burden of
getting points for Stanford. Muller
ought to win, with Howell second and
Treyer third. "Brick" has been doing
more jumping than is generally believed.
Treyer may beat Howell for second.
BROAD JUMP
The broad jump at Berkeley, according
to "Dad" Moulton, slopes downhill, so
Minsky is tigured to approach 22 feet 6,
which may or may not assure him of a
place. Merchant. Boren and Muller are
all generally good for over 22 feet.
DISCUS
This is merely a question of how far
Hartranft will heave the platter, and
how many records he will break. Berkey
of California is slated for second with
Muller third, since Arthur is out.
SHOT PUT
Here again the Cardinal should get
live points handily with Hartranft toss
ing the ball 49 feet or so. He may better
his previous mark of 50 feet. Merchant
and Witter will probably take four points
for the Bears.
JAVELIN
Captain. Hanner, in practice at Berke
ley last Saturday, hurled the spear 206
feet. There is no reason why lie should
not do as well tomorrow. Sorrcnti and
Neufeldt of the Bears have both thrown
farther than Parish, so four points will
likely go to California.
There has never been' a Big Meet,
however, in which there were not several
unlooked-for happenings. Some un

known competitor lias always broken
into the limelight, »or some veteran lias
staged a comeback.
Included in the list of "dark horses"
tomorrow are: Davis in the hurdles,
Neff in the hurdles, Merchant in the 100,
Myers and Rousselot in the two-mile.
Black in the pole vault, Minsky in the
broad jump, Graham in the pole vault,
Hendrixson in the quarter, Elliott in tin
mile, and Pearce in the half.
