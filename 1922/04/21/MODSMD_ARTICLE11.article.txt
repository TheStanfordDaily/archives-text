# OUTCOME OF MEET LIES IN THIRD PLACES
## 
### 
Seldom has there been such a collec
tion of stars gathered together in one
meet. Hartranl't, the "wonder athlete,"
Kjrksey, "second fastest human," Hau
lier. leading javelin thrower, Falk, a bet
ter than ordinary hurdler, Wilcox and
Norris in the pole vault, Muller in the
high jump, Williamson, Hendrixson, and
McDonald in the quarterâ€”these are some
of the athletes that are attracting the
public interest.
Every event will be closely contested
even to third place, for it is the three
ami one-point places that will decide.
The entries and their chances in the
events follow :
MILE RUN
The Bruins start the afternoon with
nine points. Fiskc, Denton, and Kitts
should all finish in about 4:30 minutes.
Eddlcman and Elliott, who are in poor
condition, have little chance of placing, i
440-YARD DASH
If Williamson can stave off McDon
ald's finish, he ought to break the tape in
about 50 seconds flat. Hendrixson, al
though a great competition runner, seems
. to he relegated to third place. Judah of

the Cardinal may take third.
120 HIGH HURDLES
Henderson, of the Bruins, is consistent
if nothing else, but his best time is 15 4-5
seconds. Falk is doped to win rather
easily in about 15 2-5 seconds, with
Hayes of Stanford pushing Henderson
for Second.
100-YARD DASH
The points should begin to roll to the
Cardinal side of the scoreboard with this
event. Kirksey, with his training last
summer and this spring, should win, un
less his leg goes back on him. Even at
that he has an even chance to beat
Hutchison. Sudden, the young Cardinal
dash man, is in great condition, and is
countcd on for second, or possibly first,
in case Kirksey fails to win.
880-YARD RUN
This cace will "make or break" the
Stanford chances. Scofield of Stanford
has done the best time. He and Daly,
his teammate, look to be the best. Bau
man and Pearce of the Bruins have run
close to two minutes. Macintosh may
surprise with a first or second.
