# CARD TRACK STARS WILL ENTER FRAY WITH EVEN CHANCE
## TEMPLETON'S MEN ARE STRONG IN HURDLES, DASHES AND WEIGHTS; ARTHUR WILL NOT COMPETE 
### GARRETT ELMORE, '23 
Tonight members of the Cardinal cinder path squad are
resting easily, with little thought, apparently, of tomorrow,
when they travel to Berkeley, ready to rob the Golden Bear
of his anticipated victory in the twenty-ninth annual track
classic.
The hustle and bustle of the final week have ceased; and
in the momentary lull the trainers are adding the final touches
to the condition of the athletes.
With a clear day promised by the weather man, the
setting is perfect for what is generally conceded will be the
closest and best track carnival in the history of Stanford-Cali
fornia competition. Records in a half dozen events seem
doomed to fall before the onslaught of the Cardinal and the
Blue and Gold stars.
On the eve of the meet there are few mysteries. The

past twenty-four hours have dispelled
the clouds of doubt which have hung
over the rival camps. Neither Temple
ton nor Christie have any last-minute
"sensations" or surprises up their
sleeves.
There will be very few absentees
from the ranks of either squad. Mint
Howell, crack Cardinal high jumper,
will compete, unless he takes a sud
den turn for the worse; Bob Hutchin
son, the Bruin captain, although very
weakened by his attack of tonsilitis,
will enter the lists. Arthur, Stanford
weight man, and Van Sant, California
hurdler, alone will watch the spec
tacle from the side-lines. Arthur was
finally declared ineligible. With How
ell in a weakeiul condition, what
ever advantage there may be, is ac
corded California. A powerful, well
balanced aggregation, devoid of stars,
closely akin to a "machine" —that is
Christie's team For spectacular per
formances, however, honors must go
to the squad developed .under the
guiding hand of "Dink" Templeton,
who was himself competing for the
Cardinal only three years ago.
Not the relay, but those things
known as the "breaks" will determine
the winner, say some of cinder path
followers. The team with the "dark
horses" who will annex the points in
half (Jozen events classed as "un
certain" will not need the five points
concerned in the relay for its victory.
By far the majority of the fans, how
ever, are firm in their belief that the re
! ault will hinge on the last event. Christie
and Templeton have both remained silent
on the personnel of the teams, which will
probably be selected just before the
event.
The quarter mile, with the triangular
battle between Williamson, the Cardinal
hope, and the two Bruin entries, Mc-
Donald and Hendrixson, intercollegiate
champion, is hilled as the feature race of
the afternoon. Other events in which
there will be close competition are the
100 and 220 yard dashes, half mile, pole
vault, and high jump.
Hanner, Hartranft, and Kirksey are
popularly picked as the ones almost cer
tain to shatter the records in their vari
ous events. 'I he real struggle will not
b for first places, the majority of which
are conceded to Templeton's men, hut
for the seconds and thirds.
Hartranft and Merchant, the Bruin
"handy man," will carry on a private
feud in the sprints. Both are weight
men as well as sprinters. Hartranft, on
account of his enormous stride, is fa
vored to win, although Merchant has
placed in previous big meets.
Not alone will it be a combat between
j Youth and Age. Templeton and Christie
I differ also in methods of training their
men. Templeton believes in enough
work to lying out all the possibilities;
Christie rules his men with rather an
easy hand, and gradually brings them to
j top shape for the Big Meet.
Can Stanford stem the rising tide of
j California victories? The Cardinal had
I its "seven years of plenty'' from 1913 to
111
j 1920, whereas the past two years have
| been rather "lean" ones. If victories go
I in periods, the Blue and Gold will win
jon the track for seven years. That con-
J tingency is hardly bothering Templeton,
j who, although lie doesn't predict a Card
inal win, nevertheless thinks his men
have an even break.
The entire Stanford squad was out-
I fitted with new suits yesterday. The
jerseys are white with a red "S" in the
center, and the trunks have a band of red
around the top.
The shotput will start at 1 :15 and the
track events at 1 :30.

Blue and Gold stars.
On the eve of the meet there are few mysteries. The

past twenty-four hours have dispelled
the clouds of doubt which have hung
over the rival camps. Neither Temple
ton nor Christie have any last-minute
"sensations" or surprises up their
sleeves.
There will be very few absentees
from the ranks of either squad. Mint
Howell, crack Cardinal high jumper,
will compete, unless he takes a sud
den turn for the worse; Bob Hutchin
son, the Bruin captain, although very
weakened by his attack of tonsilitis,
will enter the lists. Arthur, Stanford
weight man, and Van Sant, California
hurdler, alone will watch the spec
tacle from the side-lines. Arthur was
finally declared ineligible. With How
ell in a weakeiul condition, what
ever advantage there may be, is ac
corded California. A powerful, well
balanced aggregation, devoid of stars,
closely akin to a "machine" —that is
Christie's team For spectacular per
formances, however, honors must go
to the squad developed .under the
guiding hand of "Dink" Templeton,
who was himself competing for the
Cardinal only three years ago.
Not the relay, but those things
known as the "breaks" will determine
the winner, say some of cinder path
followers. The team with the "dark
horses" who will annex the points in
half (Jozen events classed as "un
certain" will not need the five points
concerned in the relay for its victory.
By far the majority of the fans, how
ever, are firm in their belief that the re
! ault will hinge on the last event. Christie
and Templeton have both remained silent
on the personnel of the teams, which will
probably be selected just before the
event.
The quarter mile, with the triangular
battle between Williamson, the Cardinal
hope, and the two Bruin entries, Mc-
Donald and Hendrixson, intercollegiate
champion, is hilled as the feature race of
the afternoon. Other events in which
there will be close competition are the
100 and 220 yard dashes, half mile, pole
vault, and high jump.
Hanner, Hartranft, and Kirksey are
popularly picked as the ones almost cer
tain to shatter the records in their vari
ous events. 'I he real struggle will not
b for first places, the majority of which
are conceded to Templeton's men, hut
for the seconds and thirds.
Hartranft and Merchant, the Bruin
"handy man," will carry on a private
feud in the sprints. Both are weight
men as well as sprinters. Hartranft, on
account of his enormous stride, is fa
vored to win, although Merchant has
placed in previous big meets.
Not alone will it be a combat between
j Youth and Age. Templeton and Christie
I differ also in methods of training their
men. Templeton believes in enough
work to lying out all the possibilities;
Christie rules his men with rather an
easy hand, and gradually brings them to
j top shape for the Big Meet.
Can Stanford stem the rising tide of
j California victories? The Cardinal had
I its "seven years of plenty'' from 1913 to
111
j 1920, whereas the past two years have
| been rather "lean" ones. If victories go
I in periods, the Blue and Gold will win
jon the track for seven years. That con-
J tingency is hardly bothering Templeton,
j who, although lie doesn't predict a Card
inal win, nevertheless thinks his men
have an even break.
The entire Stanford squad was out-
I fitted with new suits yesterday. The
jerseys are white with a red "S" in the
center, and the trunks have a band of red
around the top.
The shotput will start at 1 :15 and the
track events at 1 :30.
Tonight members of the Cardinal cinder path squad are
resting easily, with little thought, apparently, of tomorrow,
when they travel to Berkeley, ready to rob the Golden Bear
of his anticipated victory in the twenty-ninth annual track
classic.
The hustle and bustle of the final week have ceased; and
in the momentary lull the trainers are adding the final touches
to the condition of the athletes.
With a clear day promised by the weather man, the
setting is perfect for what is generally conceded will be the
closest and best track carnival in the history of Stanford-Cali
fornia competition. Records in a half dozen events seem
doomed to fall before the onslaught of the Cardinal and the
Blue and Gold stars.
