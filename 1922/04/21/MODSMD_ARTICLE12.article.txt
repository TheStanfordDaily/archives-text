# CARD TRACK STARS WILL ENTER FRAY WITH EVEN CHANCE
## TEMPLETON'S MEN ARE STRONG IN HURDLES, DASHES AND WEIGHTS; ARTHUR WILL NOT COMPETE 
### GARRETT ELMORE, '23 
Tonight members of the Cardinal cinder path squad are
resting easily, with little thought, apparently, of tomorrow,
when they travel to Berkeley, ready to rob the Golden Bear
of his anticipated victory in the twenty-ninth annual track
classic.
The hustle and bustle of the final week have ceased; and
in the momentary lull the trainers are adding the final touches
to the condition of the athletes.
With a clear day promised by the weather man, the
setting is perfect for what is generally conceded will be the
closest and best track carnival in the history of Stanford-Cali
fornia competition. Records in a half dozen events seem
doomed to fall before the onslaught of the Cardinal and the
Blue and Gold stars.
On the eve of the meet there are few mysteries. The

past twenty-four hours have dispelled
the clouds of doubt which have hung
over the rival camps. Neither Temple
ton nor Christie have any last-minute
"sensations" or surprises up their
sleeves.
There will be very few absentees
from the ranks of either squad. Mint
Howell, crack Cardinal high jumper,
will compete, unless he takes a sud

son, the Bruin captain, although very
weakened by his attack of tonsilitis,
will enter the lists. Arthur, Stanford
weight man, and Van Sant, California
hurdler, alone will watch the spec
tacle from the side-lines. Arthur was
finally declared ineligible. With How
ell in a weakeiul condition, what
ever advantage there may be, is ac
corded California. A powerful, well
balanced aggregation, devoid of stars,
closely akin to a "machine" â€”that is
Christie's team For spectacular per
formances, however, honors must go
to the squad developed .under the
guiding hand of "Dink" Templeton,
who was himself competing for the
Cardinal only three years ago.
Not the relay, but those things
known as the "breaks" will determine
the winner, say some of cinder path
followers. The team with the "dark
horses" who will annex the points in
half (Jozen events classed as "un
certain" will not need the five points
concerned in the relay for its victory.
By far the majority of the fans, how
