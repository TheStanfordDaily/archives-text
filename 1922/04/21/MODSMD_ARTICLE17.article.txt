# IT GOES TO SHOW
## 
### 
A lop-sided victory for the Stanford freshmen, a
comeback of stronger hitting and running by the
California babes, and then as a finale a swatting jag
that leaves the Cardinal youngsters with the title
to the baseball series. Three games, one of the
few times the series has had to go so far and wound
up by a nifty exhibition of baseball by the well
balanced team.
Hie babes outwitted, outhit, outtalked, and
outdid the I Ã¼bs yesterday. The entire freshman
nine worked like machinery behind the pitcher, while
the Californians never seemed to be able to get
going against it. Ihe result shows very gratifv
ingly the good work that Floyd Kallam has done
with making his excellent material into a well
balanced aggregation able to come through in the
pinches.
