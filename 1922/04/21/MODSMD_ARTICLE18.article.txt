# SPIRIT AND STUBBORNNESS

J onight should be quiet. Every man connected
with Stanford University fundamentally has his mind
fixed on one group of men, the athletes who work in
Berkeley Saturday. While students will he tempted
to celebrate they should bear in mind this night is the
most important of all in this year's athletic history. Jt
means condition, form, and allertness for the track
men on the Berkeley oval, and the same for the base
ball tossers at California field. It should be as quiet
as possible.
I omorrow's meet is essentially of "come-through"
character. Stanford rooters will witness one of the
greatest "guts' tests in years. Ex-Captain Kirksey,
who became one ot the country's few great sprinters
under handicaps that would have made tramps of
ordinary men, will try to register for a third time ten
points for Stanford in the dashes. He is not yet in
his best condition, but still may be capable of repeat
ing bis performances against Berkeley. Captain
Manner must break records to make good. W illiam
son, newly ranked with the fast quarter-milers, will
ibe sent against the intercollegiate champion 1 len
drixon in a race that may mean the meet. Wilcox
â€¢will also try to beat supposedly better men in the
pole vault. It is by winning over supposedly better
competitors that Stanford bases hopes of victory, yet
many experts have confidence in the ability of Tem
pleton and his outfit to do just this. So have we.
Win or lose we believe Coach Templeton has the
greatest collection of stars and come-through per
formers ever to claim the Stanford oval as their
home. But why lose? Keep the Farm quiet Friday
night, give them backing Saturday, and learn if
Stanford teams are not still made of the stuff of the
days of old.
