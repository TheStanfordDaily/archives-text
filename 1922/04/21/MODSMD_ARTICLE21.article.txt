# CABBAGES and THINGS T.I. '23

Since all good sports writers like "Brick" Morse and
Fred Farmer, as well Jack James, are posing as clair
voyants, Cabbages comes to the tore with six rahs, a
rare and a well-done to dope out the Big Meat. It's our
gravy.
* • *
It's a nice thing, by the way, that California has a
Van Santa Claua to make a merry Christmas for Stan
ford in the high hoidles. But Stanford has something to
Howell about in the high jump.
♦ * *
And so in this last day of printed grace, Cabbages has
opened a "Who Will Win" column that will make the
dopesters' ears fly back. Everybody from soaks to
celebrities have sent in their guesses. Gaze and gurgle.
» * »
Editor Cabbages, dear sir—With Kirksey and Sudden
out of the mile dash, and nobody but Ludeke entered
in the pole vault, I don't see how California can help
but win. Of course Hanner and Daly will go well in
the low hurdles, but Falk doesn't stand a chance in the
shot. I see nothing but disaster for the Stanford Red.
Well-read Willie, fifth floor Encina.

Cabbages, sir:—Cal's cookies cooked. Couldn't win
dual meet with Milpitas grammar school. Cocky, con
fident. No ability. Toll knell. Page persons. Call hearse.
Doxology.
Hurried Harold (Enroute Berkeley to place
month's allowance on Red-Shirts.)

Editor Cabbages, sir:—As a member of the faculty,
I am in a position to say that Stanford certainly ought
to win by an enormous margin. Judging by the way
men cut my classes, they must spend a studendous
amount of time training for the Meet. If they don't win,
they ought to.
FRANK FACULTY.
♦ * *
Cabbage Conductor, hello gents:—Now when I was in
college, 1 run the left leg off Locomotive Smith and gave
all the rest of the Bruins the asthma for runnin' in my
dust. I never let a California man beat me yet, and I
don't expect to see 'em beat anybody tomorrow. But I
was pretty good in '98.
AUGUST ALUMNUS.

Members of the Bruin track team were approached
early this morning and asked their opinions as to the
outcome of the Big Battle tomorrow. They said, in
part:
HUTCHINSON —''We can't win all the time. The
Cards sure stacked the deck when they drew Hartranft.
All we got was the joker."
MERCHANT —"Ever since I came to California,
eleven years ago, I've been looking forward to this
meet. I expect it to be one of my last."
MULLER—"If I don't sprain an ankle or break another
leg, chalk me up for five points in the high jump. Howell
would probably have furnished me a little competition
if he had been in his best, form."
DORR —"Twelve hours is ample work at U. C."
WITTER —"I shall have the best available detectives
around the pit to see that Hartranft doesn't substitute
a twelve-pound shot for the sixteen."
BERKEY —"I shall advise the judges to see that Hart
ranft doesn't try to palm off a pie-plate on us in the
discus."
NOORIS —"The Califoi'nia-Stanford record is going by
the boards in the pole vault tomorrow. 1 hope I do it."
I3AUMAN —"Time will tell." (He wouldn't tell the
time.)
HENDRIXSON —"Because of my Scottish descent 1
can make a quarter stretch farther than anyone I know
of."
* * •
Walter Christie was noncommittal. He said, how
ever, "This is Bear-meat."
« * *
"Dink" Templeton was studiously engaged in a game
of "purgatory" with the Breakers' cook when our special
reporter interviewed him. The cook won and "Dink"
in a bad frame of mind refused to commit himself. He
was heard to say. however, just after hurling a boiled
potato at the departing back of our esteemed reporter.
that he expected Bear meat for dinner tomorrow.
» * *
Captain Hanner menaced our beloved reporter with
the spear when he was approached this morning. "If
you value your life, don't stand within 210 feet of me
tomorrow," he remarked. Our reporter, whom we hold
in high regard, was seen to walk hastily toward the
cover of the track house.
♦ * •
Our very efficient reporter has doped out the meet,
but because of space limitations will not publish it
until Monday's issue of the "Daily." He asserts that he
will have every man and point placed. We consider
this a remarkable feat and if achieved it deserves spe
cial mention.
* * •
We hereby make special mention of the remarkable
achievement of our very efficient reporter.

I am in a position to say that Stanford certainly ought
to win by an enormous margin. Judging by the way

Cabbage Conductor, hello gents:—Now when I was in
college, 1 run the left leg off Locomotive Smith and gave
all the rest of the Bruins the asthma for runnin' in my
dust. I never let a California man beat me yet, and I
don't expect to see 'em beat anybody tomorrow. But I
was pretty good in '98.

Members of the Bruin track team were approached
early this morning and asked their opinions as to the
outcome of the Big Battle tomorrow. They said, in
part:
HUTCHINSON —''We can't win all the time. The
Cards sure stacked the deck when they drew Hartranft.
All we got was the joker."
MERCHANT —"Ever since I came to California,
eleven years ago, I've been looking forward to this
meet. I expect it to be one of my last."
MULLER—"If I don't sprain an ankle or break another
leg, chalk me up for five points in the high jump. Howell
would probably have furnished me a little competition
if he had been in his best, form."
DORR —"Twelve hours is ample work at U. C."
WITTER —"I shall have the best available detectives
around the pit to see that Hartranft doesn't substitute
a twelve-pound shot for the sixteen."
BERKEY —"I shall advise the judges to see that Hart
ranft doesn't try to palm off a pie-plate on us in the
discus."
NOORIS —"The Califoi'nia-Stanford record is going by
the boards in the pole vault tomorrow. 1 hope I do it."
I3AUMAN —"Time will tell." (He wouldn't tell the
time.)
HENDRIXSON —"Because of my Scottish descent 1
can make a quarter stretch farther than anyone I know
of."

Walter Christie was noncommittal. He said, how
ever, "This is Bear-meat."

"Dink" Templeton was studiously engaged in a game
of "purgatory" with the Breakers' cook when our special
reporter interviewed him. The cook won and "Dink"
in a bad frame of mind refused to commit himself. He
was heard to say. however, just after hurling a boiled
potato at the departing back of our esteemed reporter.
that he expected Bear meat for dinner tomorrow.

Captain Hanner menaced our beloved reporter with
the spear when he was approached this morning. "If
you value your life, don't stand within 210 feet of me
tomorrow," he remarked. Our reporter, whom we hold
in high regard, was seen to walk hastily toward the
cover of the track house.

Our very efficient reporter has doped out the meet,
but because of space limitations will not publish it
until Monday's issue of the "Daily." He asserts that he
will have every man and point placed. We consider
this a remarkable feat and if achieved it deserves spe

Since all good sports writers like "Brick" Morse and
Fred Farmer, as well Jack James, are posing as clair
voyants, Cabbages comes to the tore with six rahs, a
rare and a well-done to dope out the Big Meat. It's our
gravy.

It's a nice thing, by the way, that California has a
Van Santa Claua to make a merry Christmas for Stan
ford in the high hoidles. But Stanford has something to
Howell about in the high jump.
♦ * *
And so in this last day of printed grace, Cabbages has
opened a "Who Will Win" column that will make the
dopesters' ears fly back. Everybody from soaks to
celebrities have sent in their guesses. Gaze and gurgle.

Editor Cabbages, dear sir—With Kirksey and Sudden
out of the mile dash, and nobody but Ludeke entered
in the pole vault, I don't see how California can help
but win. Of course Hanner and Daly will go well in
the low hurdles, but Falk doesn't stand a chance in the
shot. I see nothing but disaster for the Stanford Red.

Since all good sports writers like "Brick" Morse and
Fred Farmer, as well Jack James, are posing as clair
voyants, Cabbages comes to the tore with six rahs, a
rare and a well-done to dope out the Big Meat. It's our
gravy.
* • *
It's a nice thing, by the way, that California has a
Van Santa Claua to make a merry Christmas for Stan
ford in the high hoidles. But Stanford has something to
Howell about in the high jump.
♦ * *
And so in this last day of printed grace, Cabbages has
opened a "Who Will Win" column that will make the
dopesters' ears fly back. Everybody from soaks to
celebrities have sent in their guesses. Gaze and gurgle.

Editor Cabbages, dear sir—With Kirksey and Sudden
out of the mile dash, and nobody but Ludeke entered
in the pole vault, I don't see how California can help
but win. Of course Hanner and Daly will go well in
the low hurdles, but Falk doesn't stand a chance in the
shot. I see nothing but disaster for the Stanford Red.
Well-read Willie, fifth floor Encina.

Cabbages, sir:—Cal's cookies cooked. Couldn't win
dual meet with Milpitas grammar school. Cocky, con
fident. No ability. Toll knell. Page persons. Call hearse.
Doxology.
Hurried Harold (Enroute Berkeley to place
month's allowance on Red-Shirts.)

Editor Cabbages, sir:—As a member of the faculty,
I am in a position to say that Stanford certainly ought
to win by an enormous margin. Judging by the way
men cut my classes, they must spend a studendous
amount of time training for the Meet. If they don't win,
they ought to.
FRANK FACULTY.

Cabbage Conductor, hello gents:—Now when I was in
college, 1 run the left leg off Locomotive Smith and gave
all the rest of the Bruins the asthma for runnin' in my
dust. I never let a California man beat me yet, and I
don't expect to see 'em beat anybody tomorrow. But I
was pretty good in '98.

Members of the Bruin track team were approached
early this morning and asked their opinions as to the
outcome of the Big Battle tomorrow. They said, in
part:
HUTCHINSON —''We can't win all the time. The
Cards sure stacked the deck when they drew Hartranft.
All we got was the joker."
MERCHANT —"Ever since I came to California,
eleven years ago, I've been looking forward to this
meet. I expect it to be one of my last."
MULLER—"If I don't sprain an ankle or break another
leg, chalk me up for five points in the high jump. Howell
would probably have furnished me a little competition
