# WARREN BROWN HAS AN ESKIMO PIE ON CARDINAL CHANCES
## 
### Warren Brown 
(Son Francisco "Call")
I'd like to see Stanford win the track
meet, if only for the reason that I have
bet an Eskimo pie on its chances. But
I don't think the Cardinal can make the
grade.
The most disappointing feature to me,
as these lines are written, is the illness or
injuries to star athletes on both teams.
I have in mind "Tiny" Hartranft, Mint
Howell, Boh Hutchison, et al. I'm par
ticularly disappointed in Hartranft's
case, as Harry Borba has me so "hopped
up" over this young giant's ability, 1 con
lidently expected him to knock over the
Campanile with a 678-foot put. And
I've been waiting for somebody to do
that ever since some goof climbed up in
there last football season and played
"Nearer, My God To Thee" on the
[chimes as the Southern California team
came within a foot of the Bears' goal
line.
Howe.ver, even if these star athletes
do not report for duty, I'm sure there
i will be enough around to keep "Brick"
I Morse dizzy trying to look two ways at
I the same time. And it may just work

out that Stanford will come with a rush
and we'll see the spectacle of V alter
Christie out on the track waving his arms
and wondering what it's all about. That's
what Stanford would like to see, and,
remembering my Eskimo pie bet, that's
what I'd like to see myself, especially if
it's a warm day. But it can't be done—
not this vear.
