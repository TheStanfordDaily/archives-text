# MUSCIO AND WASSUM COMBINATION LEADS IN CARNIVAL RACE
## 
### 
"Husky" Wassum and Neva Muscio,
backed by a powerful organization,
flooded the ballot box in the first two
days of free voting, rolling up a total
of 4640 and 3870 votes for King and
Queen of Vanity Fair, when the count
so far was completed at 1 o'clock
today. Their lead was being threaten
ed, however, by Frances McGregor
and Eddie Waful. whose supporters
brought in a basket fovotes totalling
2240 and 1630, and announced that
more were on the way. Jim Lawyer
and Peggy Richardson broke into
third place this morning with 1530 and
1570> respectively.
Free voting closes with tonight's
issue of the Daily, and ticket sales,
votes for king and queen retailing at
one cent each, started today, and will
continue until the final day of the
contest. Whether the present leaders
will lose their advantage when finance
enters the contest is problematical,
and campaign managers are already
lining up the Wall Street influence.
Starting Monday, cuts in candidates
will begin, with the roll being sliced
to eight on Monday, to six on Tues
day, and narrowing down to three on
Wednesday, with one more day to go.
At 12 o'clock Thursday the final tally
will be made, and the rulers of Vanity
Fair announced.
