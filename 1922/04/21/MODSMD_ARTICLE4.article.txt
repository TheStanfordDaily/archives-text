# INDIVIDUALISM IS MODERN PROBLEM, DECLARES BABBITT
## 
### 
To find some means of controlling the
rank individualism of today is the most
pressing modern problem, according to
Professor Babbitt, who lectured on
"True and False Liberals" in the Little
Theatre last night. "The solution," he
continued, "is not to be found in external
control and legislative enactment such as
is popular today, but in an inner control
which the individual must exercise over
himself.''
Because man today does not fear tra
ditional authority, lie has given himself
over to the entire satisfaction of his
natural desires and appetites. The doc
trine has grown up, said Professor Bab
bitt, that because a man desires a thing
is a sufficient reason for his taking it.
This has resulted in Occidental individ
ualism that threatens to overthrow
Western civilization. It is this individ
ualism which has been the cause of the
intense nationalism and imperialism
which runs rampant in Europe and has
split the peoples of Europe into armed
camps ready to fly at one another's
throats. If Europe keeps on in this
fashion, a real Asiatic "yellow peril"
threatens the Occident, in Professor
Babbitt's opinion.
Europe and America must look to the
Orient to find the secret of true liberty
and individualism. Buddha, Confuscius,
and Jesus —all Orientals—have repeated
ly maintained that if man is to attain the
high and good things of this life he must
work for them with strenuous effort.
Not only physical work is absolutely
necessary, but more especially mental,
moral, and spiritual work.
