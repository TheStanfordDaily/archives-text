# SEAY'S NINE MEETS BEARS IN DECIDING CONTEST TOMORROW
## Guy Draper to Occupy Mound For Cardinal Nine; Line-up to Be Same As Last Week 
### 
Tomorrow the 1922 baseball series will
go either to the Cardinal or the Mine and
Gold. Barring an extra-inning tie, either
one team or the other will emerge from
the fracas at Berkeley tomorrow after
noon with the game and the series tucked
away. If California does it, it will be
what was expected by everyone three
weeks ago, before the first game of the
three was played. If Stanford wins the
series it will be one of the biggest re
versals the dope hounds have suffered
since David confounded the ancient sport
critics.
Looking at it from every angle, the
Cardinal stands just as good a chance
of waving triumphantly when the score
keeper finally clambers down from his
platform as does the Blue and Gold. In
the first game California was clearly out
classed. In the second game the Blue
and Gold showed a great improvement,
but they had to go extra innings to win,
3-2â€”despite the fact that Draper was
not going as good as usual.
In this third game, the Cardinal at
tack should be able to register at least
three runs. Each succeeding contest
lately has shown the batting averages to
be slowly but surely creeping up. The
defense, if it can duplicate last Satur
day's work, will be enough to win almost
any game. Draper should have no more
trouble than he had last Saturday, and
he probably will not have as much. The
score should be low and close.
The line-up that will start the melee
will be practically the same as that which
has been used in the first two series
games. Seay will in all probability pitch
Draper again, as he is the surest Cardinal
bet. Green will receive Draper's shoots.
Woodward will guard first, and from the
sensational fielding that "Bud" has been
doling out lately, the Blue and Gold bat
ters will have a hard time getting safe
ones along the first base line. Peavy
will be at second to scoop up grounders
reliably and efficiently, while Maillot will
guard short. Heckendorf will be sta
tioned at the third station to take care
of the hot ones that come from the Blue
and Gold pomegranate maulers.
The outfield will be chosen from four
men: Parker, Carver, Wayland, and
Mitchell. All four have been used in the
series so far. Parker is especially val
uable as a hitter, besides being a fast
man on the bases. For reserve pitchers
Seay has Clark, Loewenstein and Nef to
call on if necessarv.
