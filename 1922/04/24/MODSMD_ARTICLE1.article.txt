Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling, Jack
London, and Theodore RooseveP. Mr.
Ellsworth believes that every person,
whether he intends to follow writing

Mr. Ellsworth is not a new figure

lecture, bound to interest not only to
those who write, but those, who, hav
ing no thought of writing, enjoy what
is written."
