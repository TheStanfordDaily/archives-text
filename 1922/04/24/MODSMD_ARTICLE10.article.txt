# CARDINALS AND BEARS BATTLE TO DEADLOCK IN BIG TRACK CLASSIC
## RELAY TEAM SAVES COACH CHRISTIE'S MEN FROM DEFEAT Hartranft High Point Man; Williamson Wins Quarter From Hendrixson 
### GARRETT ELMORE, '23 
Before 20,000 persons, jammed into the Berkeley oval, Saturday, Cardinal
cinder path stars tore to pieces the fiction of a California "wonder" track
team.
Only a first-class relay team lifted Christie's "second-third place" aggre
gation—figured as an easy winner—from a 70)-.>-60]/ 2 defeat to a
deadlock, for the second time in the twenty-eight years of competition neither
team could gain the necessary advantage.
Is was a heart-straining two hours. For an hour and a half predictions
and comparative figures went into the discard as Templeton's men fought
their way to unexpected firsts, seconds and thirds. With the javelin, broad
jump and relay left, the man on the score board hung up, Stanford 60'/£<
California, 47]/ 2 , and the Cardinal rooters in the west stands went wild.
Then the Bruins, with defeat staring them in the face, halted the vic
torious march of the Cardinal. Boren, Merchant, and Treyor, the Blue and
Gold broad jumpers, "came through," although Minsky leaped 22 feet 7y 2
inches. Farish threw the javelin farther than he ever had before, but was
beaten by Sorrenti of the Bears for third, by one foot.
The relay did not decide the meet ,as so many had believed would be the

case. It merely determined whether
Christie's team would be saved by a
tie, or whether Stanford would win by
ten points.
T mpleton Saves Sudden
In the final event the Bears came up
to expectations. Blemmer led Wright
by ten yards, and Henderson added
three more over Clarke. Judah held
his own, and Williamson gained on
McDonald, but the handicap was too
great.
Templeton refused to let Sudden,
who had won the 100 and 220, run a
lap for the Cardinal. It might have
injured the sprint phenom, and Temp
leton preferred to save him for the
I. C. A. A.. A. A. meet next month.
Ten First Places
But five out fifteen firsts, including
the relay, were captured by the Bluo
and Cold; Qardinal performers ac
counted for the other ten.
Despite close competition, the times
were slow, due to the loose California
track. Only two records, both of them
Stanford-California marks, were shat
tered, instead of the anticipated five
or six. Hartranft, who led the scoring
with eleven points, threw the discus
137 feet, and Hanner tossed the jave
lin 182 feet l/ 2 inches.
Upset No. 1 came when Elliott, with
but three weeks of training, out-gamed
Fisk of California for third in the
mile. Elliott used every ounce of
energy in the race, and had to be car
ried to the training quarters.
Champions Beaten
Three national intercollegiate cham
pions gave way to new comers Satur
day; Muller in the high jump alone
retained his laurels.
Williamson- brought the Cardinal
home first in the feature quarter-mile,
besting Hendrixson, champion in 1920
j and 1921, by three yards. Judah, run
-1 ning a heady race, slipped into third
ahead of McDonald of California. Mc
, Donald found the pace too hot to al
low him to stage his famous finish.
"Red" Norris, heralded as a great
competition athlete, and joint holder of
intercollegiate title, had to be con
tent with third in the pole vault. Wil
cox and Black, the latter winning the
title of champion "darkhorse," were in
great form, and tied for first at 12 feet
5 inches.
Morris Kirksey, who had won ten
points for Stanford in the meets for
the past three years, attempted to
repeat, but his leg gave way under
the strain. Sudden bested him in the
hundred, and in the 220 the famous
sprinter had to pull up at the 150-
yard mark. Hutchison and Merchant
failed to place in the 100. Hartranft
ran in third. In the 220 Sudden won,
the Bruin skipper second, and Corn
stock third.
Daly Captures Half
For almost the entire two laps, Daly
lay back in the bunch while his team
mate Macintosh led the field. On the
final stretch Daly uncorked a fast
spurt, passing Pearce and Bauman of
the Bears. He ran the event in 1:59:3
minutes, the best time made this sea
sond around the bay.
Falk contributed ten points to the
Cardinal total, winning both hurdles.
Hayes and Davis put the Stanford lead
out of striking distance by finishing
second and third in the lows.
Dalton, who wound up a lengthy
career for the Bears Saturday, did
better than he thought when in the
early part of the aftrnoon he tied with
Howell for third in the high jump.
That half point would have meant
the 220-yard dash. Howell who had
that Stanford had the meet won after
a temperature of 101 degrees was obvi
ously relying on his nerve alone.

I. C. A. A.. A. A. meet next month.
Ten First Places
But five out fifteen firsts, including
the relay, were captured by the Bluo
and Cold; Qardinal performers ac
counted for the other ten.
Despite close competition, the times
were slow, due to the loose California
track. Only two records, both of them
Stanford-California marks, were shat
tered, instead of the anticipated five
or six. Hartranft, who led the scoring
with eleven points, threw the discus
137 feet, and Hanner tossed the jave
lin 182 feet l/ 2 inches.
Upset No. 1 came when Elliott, with
but three weeks of training, out-gamed
Fisk of California for third in the
mile. Elliott used every ounce of
energy in the race, and had to be car
ried to the training quarters.
Champions Beaten
Three national intercollegiate cham
pions gave way to new comers Satur
day; Muller in the high jump alone
retained his laurels.
Williamson- brought the Cardinal
home first in the feature quarter-mile,
besting Hendrixson, champion in 1920
j and 1921, by three yards. Judah, run
-1 ning a heady race, slipped into third
ahead of McDonald of California. Mc
, Donald found the pace too hot to al
low him to stage his famous finish.
"Red" Norris, heralded as a great
competition athlete, and joint holder of
intercollegiate title, had to be con
tent with third in the pole vault. Wil
cox and Black, the latter winning the
title of champion "darkhorse," were in
great form, and tied for first at 12 feet
5 inches.
Morris Kirksey, who had won ten
points for Stanford in the meets for
the past three years, attempted to
repeat, but his leg gave way under
the strain. Sudden bested him in the
hundred, and in the 220 the famous
sprinter had to pull up at the 150-
yard mark. Hutchison and Merchant
failed to place in the 100. Hartranft
ran in third. In the 220 Sudden won,
the Bruin skipper second, and Corn
stock third.
Daly Captures Half
For almost the entire two laps, Daly
lay back in the bunch while his team
mate Macintosh led the field. On the
final stretch Daly uncorked a fast
spurt, passing Pearce and Bauman of
the Bears. He ran the event in 1:59:3
minutes, the best time made this sea
sond around the bay.
Falk contributed ten points to the
Cardinal total, winning both hurdles.
Hayes and Davis put the Stanford lead
out of striking distance by finishing
second and third in the lows.
Dalton, who wound up a lengthy
career for the Bears Saturday, did
better than he thought when in the
early part of the aftrnoon he tied with
Howell for third in the high jump.
That half point would have meant
the 220-yard dash. Howell who had
that Stanford had the meet won after
a temperature of 101 degrees was obvi
ously relying on his nerve alone.
The results:
Mile Run—Kitts (C), first; Denton (C),
second; Elliott (S), third. Time, 4:02 minutes.
440-yard Run —Williamson (S), first; Hen
drixson (C), second; Judah (S), third. Time,

Before 20,000 persons, jammed into the Berkeley oval, Saturday, Cardinal
cinder path stars tore to pieces the fiction of a California "wonder" track
team.
Only a first-class relay team lifted Christie's "second-third place" aggre
gation—figured as an easy winner—from a 70)-.>-60]/ 2 defeat to a
deadlock, for the second time in the twenty-eight years of competition neither
team could gain the necessary advantage.
Is was a heart-straining two hours. For an hour and a half predictions
and comparative figures went into the discard as Templeton's men fought
their way to unexpected firsts, seconds and thirds. With the javelin, broad
jump and relay left, the man on the score board hung up, Stanford 60'/£<
California, 47]/ 2 , and the Cardinal rooters in the west stands went wild.
Then the Bruins, with defeat staring them in the face, halted the vic
torious march of the Cardinal. Boren, Merchant, and Treyor, the Blue and
Gold broad jumpers, "came through," although Minsky leaped 22 feet 7y 2
inches. Farish threw the javelin farther than he ever had before, but was
beaten by Sorrenti of the Bears for third, by one foot.
The relay did not decide the meet ,as so many had believed would be the

case. It merely determined whether
Christie's team would be saved by a
tie, or whether Stanford would win by
ten points.
T mpleton Saves Sudden
In the final event the Bears came up
to expectations. Blemmer led Wright
by ten yards, and Henderson added
three more over Clarke. Judah held
his own, and Williamson gained on
McDonald, but the handicap was too
great.
Templeton refused to let Sudden,
who had won the 100 and 220, run a
lap for the Cardinal. It might have

leton preferred to save him for the

failed to place in the 100. Hartranft
ran in third. In the 220 Sudden won,
the Bruin skipper second, and Corn
stock third.
Daly Captures Half
For almost the entire two laps, Daly
lay back in the bunch while his team
mate Macintosh led the field. On the
final stretch Daly uncorked a fast
spurt, passing Pearce and Bauman of
the Bears. He ran the event in 1:59:3
minutes, the best time made this sea
sond around the bay.
Falk contributed ten points to the
Cardinal total, winning both hurdles.
Hayes and Davis put the Stanford lead
out of striking distance by finishing
second and third in the lows.
Dalton, who wound up a lengthy
career for the Bears Saturday, did
better than he thought when in the
early part of the aftrnoon he tied with
Howell for third in the high jump.
That half point would have meant
the 220-yard dash. Howell who had
that Stanford had the meet won after
a temperature of 101 degrees was obvi
ously relying on his nerve alone.
The results:
Mile Run—Kitts (C), first; Denton (C),
second; Elliott (S), third. Time, 4:02 minutes.
440-yard Run —Williamson (S), first; Hen
drixson (C), second; Judah (S), third. Time,

Before 20,000 persons, jammed into the Berkeley oval, Saturday, Cardinal
cinder path stars tore to pieces the fiction of a California "wonder" track
team.
Only a first-class relay team lifted Christie's "second-third place" aggre
gation—figured as an easy winner—from a 70)-.>-60]/ 2 defeat to a
deadlock, for the second time in the twenty-eight years of competition neither
team could gain the necessary advantage.
Is was a heart-straining two hours. For an hour and a half predictions
and comparative figures went into the discard as Templeton's men fought
their way to unexpected firsts, seconds and thirds. With the javelin, broad
jump and relay left, the man on the score board hung up, Stanford 60'/£<
California, 47]/ 2 , and the Cardinal rooters in the west stands went wild.
Then the Bruins, with defeat staring them in the face, halted the vic
torious march of the Cardinal. Boren, Merchant, and Treyor, the Blue and
Gold broad jumpers, "came through," although Minsky leaped 22 feet 7y 2
inches. Farish threw the javelin farther than he ever had before, but was
beaten by Sorrenti of the Bears for third, by one foot.
The relay did not decide the meet ,as so many had believed would be the

case. It merely determined whether
Christie's team would be saved by a
tie, or whether Stanford would win by
ten points.
T mpleton Saves Sudden
In the final event the Bears came up
to expectations. Blemmer led Wright
by ten yards, and Henderson added
three more over Clarke. Judah held
his own, and Williamson gained on
McDonald, but the handicap was too
great.
Templeton refused to let Sudden,
who had won the 100 and 220, run a
lap for the Cardinal. It might have
injured the sprint phenom, and Temp
leton preferred to save him for the
I. C. A. A.. A. A. meet next month.
Ten First Places
But five out fifteen firsts, including
the relay, were captured by the Bluo
and Cold; Qardinal performers ac
counted for the other ten.
Despite close competition, the times
were slow, due to the loose California
track. Only two records, both of them
Stanford-California marks, were shat
tered, instead of the anticipated five
or six. Hartranft, who led the scoring
with eleven points, threw the discus
137 feet, and Hanner tossed the jave
lin 182 feet l/ 2 inches.
Upset No. 1 came when Elliott, with
but three weeks of training, out-gamed
Fisk of California for third in the
mile. Elliott used every ounce of
energy in the race, and had to be car
ried to the training quarters.
Champions Beaten
Three national intercollegiate cham
pions gave way to new comers Satur
day; Muller in the high jump alone
retained his laurels.
Williamson- brought the Cardinal
home first in the feature quarter-mile,
besting Hendrixson, champion in 1920
j and 1921, by three yards. Judah, run
-1 ning a heady race, slipped into third
ahead of McDonald of California. Mc
, Donald found the pace too hot to al
low him to stage his famous finish.
"Red" Norris, heralded as a great
competition athlete, and joint holder of
intercollegiate title, had to be con
tent with third in the pole vault. Wil
cox and Black, the latter winning the
title of champion "darkhorse," were in
great form, and tied for first at 12 feet
5 inches.
Morris Kirksey, who had won ten
points for Stanford in the meets for
the past three years, attempted to
repeat, but his leg gave way under
the strain. Sudden bested him in the
hundred, and in the 220 the famous
sprinter had to pull up at the 150-

Before 20,000 persons, jammed into the Berkeley oval, Saturday, Cardinal
cinder path stars tore to pieces the fiction of a California "wonder" track
team.
Only a first-class relay team lifted Christie's "second-third place" aggre
gation—figured as an easy winner—from a 70)-.>-60]/ 2 defeat to a
deadlock, for the second time in the twenty-eight years of competition neither
team could gain the necessary advantage.
Is was a heart-straining two hours. For an hour and a half predictions
and comparative figures went into the discard as Templeton's men fought
their way to unexpected firsts, seconds and thirds. With the javelin, broad
jump and relay left, the man on the score board hung up, Stanford 60'/£<
California, 47]/ 2 , and the Cardinal rooters in the west stands went wild.
Then the Bruins, with defeat staring them in the face, halted the vic
torious march of the Cardinal. Boren, Merchant, and Treyor, the Blue and
Gold broad jumpers, "came through," although Minsky leaped 22 feet 7y 2
inches. Farish threw the javelin farther than he ever had before, but was
beaten by Sorrenti of the Bears for third, by one foot.
The relay did not decide the meet ,as so many had believed would be the

case. It merely determined whether
Christie's team would be saved by a
tie, or whether Stanford would win by
ten points.
T mpleton Saves Sudden
In the final event the Bears came up
to expectations. Blemmer led Wright
by ten yards, and Henderson added
three more over Clarke. Judah held
his own, and Williamson gained on
McDonald, but the handicap was too
great.
Templeton refused to let Sudden,
who had won the 100 and 220, run a
lap for the Cardinal. It might have
injured the sprint phenom, and Temp
leton preferred to save him for the
I. C. A. A.. A. A. meet next month.
Ten First Places
But five out fifteen firsts, including
the relay, were captured by the Bluo
and Cold; Qardinal performers ac
counted for the other ten.
Despite close competition, the times
were slow, due to the loose California
track. Only two records, both of them
Stanford-California marks, were shat
tered, instead of the anticipated five
or six. Hartranft, who led the scoring
with eleven points, threw the discus
137 feet, and Hanner tossed the jave
lin 182 feet l/ 2 inches.
Upset No. 1 came when Elliott, with
but three weeks of training, out-gamed
Fisk of California for third in the
mile. Elliott used every ounce of
energy in the race, and had to be car
ried to the training quarters.
Champions Beaten
Three national intercollegiate cham
pions gave way to new comers Satur
day; Muller in the high jump alone
retained his laurels.
Williamson- brought the Cardinal
home first in the feature quarter-mile,
besting Hendrixson, champion in 1920
j and 1921, by three yards. Judah, run
-1 ning a heady race, slipped into third
ahead of McDonald of California. Mc
, Donald found the pace too hot to al
low him to stage his famous finish.
"Red" Norris, heralded as a great
competition athlete, and joint holder of
intercollegiate title, had to be con
tent with third in the pole vault. Wil
cox and Black, the latter winning the
title of champion "darkhorse," were in
great form, and tied for first at 12 feet
5 inches.
Morris Kirksey, who had won ten
points for Stanford in the meets for
the past three years, attempted to
repeat, but his leg gave way under
the strain. Sudden bested him in the
hundred, and in the 220 the famous
sprinter had to pull up at the 150-
yard mark. Hutchison and Merchant
failed to place in the 100. Hartranft
ran in third. In the 220 Sudden won,
the Bruin skipper second, and Corn
stock third.
Daly Captures Half
For almost the entire two laps, Daly
lay back in the bunch while his team
mate Macintosh led the field. On the
final stretch Daly uncorked a fast
spurt, passing Pearce and Bauman of
the Bears. He ran the event in 1:59:3
minutes, the best time made this sea
sond around the bay.
Falk contributed ten points to the
Cardinal total, winning both hurdles.
Hayes and Davis put the Stanford lead
out of striking distance by finishing
second and third in the lows.
Dalton, who wound up a lengthy
career for the Bears Saturday, did
better than he thought when in the
early part of the aftrnoon he tied with
Howell for third in the high jump.
That half point would have meant
the 220-yard dash. Howell who had
that Stanford had the meet won after
a temperature of 101 degrees was obvi
ously relying on his nerve alone.
