# WOW NINE WINS FINAL GAME 54
## Morrow Holds Card Sluggers to Four Hits in Deciding Battle for Championship 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
California 5, Stanford o—nine innings.
fhe Blue and Gold carrfled off the an :
nual baseball series when they won the
third game Saturday afternoon on the
Berkeley held. The game was fast and
well-played, but the Cardinal nine had
few chances to put over the runs neces
sary to win. What chances did come
along were smothered by California's
fielding, especially the sensational
catches by Douthit in center.
Draper pitched the whole game, and
was touched for ten hits. These were
bunched opportunely by the Bruin slug
gers. so that they made the most of their
opportunities. Morrow, California's
hurler, allowed only four hits. Peavy,
going on a batting spree, got three of
these in three times up. Maillot was the
only other Card batter who could get a
bingle off Morrow. Perfect support was
accorded Draper, while only one error
was made behind Morrow.
Three tallies were manufactured by
the Blue and Gold in the first frame. H.
Makin singled, and got to third by some
tricky base-running when G. Makin
rolled one down to short. Both men
were safe, and scored when Thompson
lived up to his heavy-hitting reputation
by connecting for a double. Douthit
flew out, but Radebaugh, whose pinch
hit the Saturday before had proven fatal,
lined out a single, scoring Thompson.
Draper allowed two more runs the next
inning. Frb, of football fame, tripled to
left, and was promptly brought in when
Morrow doubled over the right field net
ting. McHenry singled, but Draper re
tired the next three men.
The fifth run was made in the seventh
inning. H. Makin received a free pass,
went to second on his brother's infield
out. and scored when Thompson got his
second timely hit of the day.
The Cardinal attack was not strong
enough to seriously menace California.
Once, in the third, what might have been
a good chance was smothered by Dout
hit in center field. Peavy, first up,
started his slugging day by a clean sin-
gle. Heckendorf landed on one with all
his force, and the horsehide sailed high
and far and fast out into center. Dout
liit turned his back on the ball and raced
for the grandstands. Sticking up his
mitt, he made a running back-handed
catch that savored of highway robbery.
Peavy got on first twice more through
his own efforts, but never got to second.
Every once in a while one of Seay's
men would land on the ball hard, but it
always went into the waiting hands of a
California outfielder.
