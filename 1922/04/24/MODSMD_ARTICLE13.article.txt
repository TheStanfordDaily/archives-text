# "PENROD" PLAYS TO STANFORD AUDIENCE
## 
### 
Campus audiences take a personal atti
tude toward Stanford plays. They are
not highly critical, except when some
body forgets his lines in the big scene.
So "Penrod," the endowment committee's
offering at the Alcazar Theatre in San
Francisco Saturday night, bewildered
the campus critic, for there was none of
the intimate interest bred of adjacent
seats at 8 o'clock, and none of the usual
amateur defects to pick on. The Alcazar
players showed customary professional
finish, but the comedy lacked the uncon
scious whoop of college productions.
However, the six children in the cast in
troduced a few private whoops of their
own which more than made up for the
lack.
For some obscure reason, the campus
talent and yell kings failed to show. Pos
sibly the sedate mob of alumni out front
abashed them.
"Penrod" presented a surprising inno
vationâ€”a comedy which did not depend,
411 a single instance, on prohibition or co
educaton for its laughs. The problems
of one small boy furnished constant fun
for four acts, with interludes of domestic
trials by Penrod's parents. What might
even be called juvenile slapstick was in
troduced in the second act, for the plot
went into the regular movie-comedy
chase, with four kids in ftirtive but noisy
pursuit; the hounded villain was greatly
wronged, being a horse-thief in Penrod's
dramatic imagination, when he was
really a high class con-man.
Bob Russell was "Penrod" as Booth
