# "PENROD" PLAYS TO STANFORD AUDIENCE
## 
### 
Campus audiences take a personal atti
tude toward Stanford plays. They are
not highly critical, except when some
body forgets his lines in the big scene.
So "Penrod," the endowment committee's
offering at the Alcazar Theatre in San
Francisco Saturday night, bewildered
the campus critic, for there was none of
the intimate interest bred of adjacent
seats at 8 o'clock, and none of the usual
amateur defects to pick on. The Alcazar
players showed customary professional
finish, but the comedy lacked the uncon
scious whoop of college productions.
However, the six children in the cast in
troduced a few private whoops of their
own which more than made up for the
lack.
For some obscure reason, the campus
talent and yell kings failed to show. Pos
sibly the sedate mob of alumni out front
abashed them.
"Penrod" presented a surprising inno
vation—a comedy which did not depend,
411 a single instance, on prohibition or co
educaton for its laughs. The problems
of one small boy furnished constant fun
for four acts, with interludes of domestic
trials by Penrod's parents. What might
even be called juvenile slapstick was in
troduced in the second act, for the plot
went into the regular movie-comedy
chase, with four kids in ftirtive but noisy
pursuit; the hounded villain was greatly
wronged, being a horse-thief in Penrod's
dramatic imagination, when he was
really a high class con-man.
Bob Russell was "Penrod" as Booth
Tartyngton conceived him—even more
than Wesley Barry in the film version.
In spite of the attempt of Ed Rose, the
adaptor, to make of Penrod an extraor
dinary youth, even a wild and undisci
plined one according to the lines he gives
his grown-ups, he is still, in Russell's
careful interpretation, an ordinary boy
who gets into ordinary scrapes. The two
colored boys were perfect in their parts,
especially Lloyd Anderson, the younger
brother, as "Verman," who was very
tongue-tied, and let every one know it.
Gladys George, the leading lady, as
"Margaret Scholield," was, excluding the
ten-color back drop, quite th most beau
tiful thing on the stage. Anatomically,
her nose is that peculiar shape which can
be called neither classic nor retrousse,
and her abundant golden hair met the
eye with considerable force; but pulchi
tudinally, she dazzled, even with field
glasses.
It's not fair to compare campus actors
with a stock company, which has also
had seven days' performances to correct
weak action. A statement, then, that
the cast of "Penrod" made every part
stand out as an individual, in contrast to
the two or three people who usually bear
the burden of acting in Assembly Hall
plays, must be taken with that reserva
tion.
Stanford far outclassed the San Fran
cisco house in settings. The Alcazar's
scenery was obviously moth-eaten and
often in bad taste. The living room in
the last act, in particular, had a com
bination of red plush boarding house fur
niture and fashionable miniature table
lamp. The stage storm effect was fairly
good, except sometimes when the thun
der forgot to follow the lightning.
