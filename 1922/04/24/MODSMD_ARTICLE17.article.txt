No Stanford man familiar with Cardinal athletics
for the last three years conid review the dual track
and field competition of Saturday without a tribute
to former Captain Morris Kirksey, who registered a
very necessary three points in the 100-yard dash.
Kirksey became one of the world's few great sprint
ers under handicaps that probably no other athlete
could have mastered; and, with all reason against his
starting, he thought little of entering two more
â– dashes with the hope of aiding a Stanford victory.
Experts point out that Kirksey's leg seemed to tie
between the seventy- and eighty-yard mark of the
century, though he himself says he did not feel it
then.
Normally he would never have entered the fur
long. He knew his leg, which was hard as stone,
could not hold; but it was hope against judgment,
and he risked practically everything he had in an
effort to get an extra point that would cinch the
meet. The muscle tied up completely and he could
not finish the last dual meet race he will ever run.
The sprint star may never run again. A less de
termined athlete would certainly be through, but you
never can tell about Kirksey. Whether he does or
doesn't put away his spikes, Stanford's athletic pres
tige owes to him more than to any captain of history,
for he upheld the name of Stanford with great per
formances in races of America and Europe, at a time,
during an unprecedented all-round athletic slump,
when Stanford was most in need of a redeeming
power.
Do not mistake this for sympathy. An athlete
who could countenance such a thing would not be
admired on the Farm. But the good name of Stan
ford athletics, for a three-year period, has rested
largely on the performances of one great athlete.
Stanford knows it. If he is through, or if he \\*ns
the next I. C. 4-A., the name of Morris Kirksey will
occupy a top place in the minds of Stanford en
thusiasts long after Dink Templeton gets his present
flock of younger champions to shattering records as
well as dope sheets.
