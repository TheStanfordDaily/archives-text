t When the track meet was over the most prophetic
<»112 those who claimed the dope would be upset had
seen more upsetting than ever would have been sus
pected. Men not conceded a chance had come
through in a manner that made Walt Christie keep
that anxious look; he had looked for a big lead ala
the "Brick" Morse forecast, and something had gone
wrong. It is all in the way you look at it, and to us
it seems that things went right.
After the relay had been run the sideliners could
pick many places where the meet could have been
won. If Mint Howell hadn't been sick for two
weeks, if Morris Kirksey hadn't had his leg hurt last
year, if the broad jump had only gone right so that
twenty-two feet seven inches would have meant a
place as was doped. The ifs had a lot of theories to
offer on how the day should have been won but most
of them omitted to think of how easily it could have
l>een lost. We were not lucky to win, we simply
came through in a lot of places that the "wise ones"
had not seen possible. No one thought of a tie for
first in the pole vault; that is, no one among the
doping public. Few gave us three places in the
hundred. Not many offered any money on two
places in the quarter.
That is the way the meet went, however. It was
the story of past meets over again, but this time we

were equipped with bettter material. When an
event went adversely sonic among the crowd weak
ened. but there was no weakening on the bench by
the Stanford dressing room. "Dink" Templeton
had his squad balanced to win ; he was confident that
the necessary number of points were to be taken by
his men and he wasn't much off. When we look at
all the forecasts made "of the meet's outcome we sort
of think that another victory has been chalked up
for youth over the old established order.
