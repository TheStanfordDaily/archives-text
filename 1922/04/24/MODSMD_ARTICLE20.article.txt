Irving Berlin writes confidentially that he writes all
his Blues songs on Monday. That being the case, there
is still a wide field for the amateur Blues writers that
are springing up everywhere. Suggestions for Blues
titles f0110w... Long titles seem to be all the rage now:
• • •
"Those Dyeing Blues."
"I've Got Those Beans-Every-Sunday-Night-Hash-Every-
Monday-night Blues."
"Those Whose-Gone-and-Taken-My-Pebeco-Tube-Again-
Blues."
"The're The Blues the Head-Waiter Gave Me."
"I've Got Those Mussed-Up-and-Fussed-Up-and-Out-or-
Breath-Running-From-Trying-To-Get-There-on-
Time-But-I-Missed-That-Last-Train-Again Blues."
"Those Monday Blues."
* • • •
—1935—
"We regret to see that the class of 1933 has again
violated all rules of decency and respect in putting up
their dance poster. The word "hop" is not only un
dignified, but non-euphronious, and the mere mention of
"date" is certainly out of place on a public pronounce
ment such as this. The placard menace is becoming a
serious one, and unless such crudity is throttled, trouble
may result."
* * •
Absent-minded profs are used far too often in jokes.
Therefore pass over this one if you like the unusual. But
Palmolive Pete hands out that it's the straight goods
that one prof he knew was so absent-minded that when
he came home from a walk in the rain, they found his
umbrella in the bed, while he was standing in a corner,
dripping wet.

Our idea of a publicity hound: —The guy that signs
up for library books so that he can have his name be
fore the public.
Disappointed patron:—l thought I had sixteen, but one
of them flew.'

No, Heloise, the section gang is not the track squad.

But the spirited Cards
Berft the Bruins by yards

Encouraged by the waves of applause following this
delightful bit of poetry, our able verse writer responded
to the encore with this:
There's a college that's known as U. C.
But its track team is up a tall tree.
For the boys from the Farm,
Turned in the alarm.
And put out the fiire as you see.
As the resulting subdued snicker, our talented verse
