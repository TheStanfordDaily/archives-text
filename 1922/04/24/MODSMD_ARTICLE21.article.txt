THE GERMANS AT GENOA
The Germans have agreed to withdraw
from all committees and commissions
dealing with Russian affairs. This was
the Allied alternative to the revocation
of the Russo-German agreement signed
at Rapallo, and the result of the German
withdrawal will be the continuance of
the Genoa conference. The Germans
have also contributed further to the
tranquillity of the conference by deciding
not to send any answer to the note of
the Ten Powers stating that they re
tained the right to declare void any clause
in the Russo-German agreement which
conflicts with any existing treaty.
THE RUSSIAN NOTE
The Russian reply to the demands of
the Allied experts covers four main
points:
First—Russian agrees to recognize her
war debts on condition that the Allies
reduce the amount by not demanding pay
ment of the now overdue interest and
granting a moratorium.
Second—Assumption of the pre-war
debts is made conditional upon de jure
recognition of the soviet government by
the Allies.
Third—Both the first and second are
contingent upon a loan of the powers to
Russia.
Fourth—The soviets promise adher
ence to the principle of restitution of
property formerly belonging to foreign
ers but seized by them during the revolu
tion and subsequently.
STRUGGLE FOR PEACE IN IRE
The Labor party of southern Ireland,
backed by the Lord Mayor and Council
of Dublin, called a general strike for to
day (Monday), the purpose being a pro
test against civil war in Ireland.
Michael Collins, head of the Free
State provisional government, on Satur
day won supporters for his cause and
bore witness of his position as head of
the only legal government of Ireland.
He went to Kilarney, the heart of the
rebel district, and spoke there aft# the
meeting had been forbidden by the au
thorities of the so-called Irish Republic.
The latter had also attempted to block
the roads, and Michael Collins was met
at the station by a squadron of the rebel
troops; nevertheless he was successful
in carrying out his plans.
