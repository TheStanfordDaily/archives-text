# BLUE AND GOLD CREW OUTROWED BY VIKINGS IN SEATTLE REGATTA
## 
### 
The University of Washington Vikings
outrowed California's varsity shell crew
over a three-mile course, winning by ten
boat lengths, in the annual regatta held
on Lake Washington last Saturday. The
Blue and Gold freshmen lost by eight
boat lengths in two miles.
The Washington varsity raced through
with a time of 15 minutes 58 3-5 seconds,
within 2 3-5 seconds of the record time
made by Washington in 1916.
This event, first scheduled for 10
o'clock, was postponed until nearly 4, due
to the roughness of the water, which made
rowing impossible. California took the
lead with short, strokes, but fell
behind when Washington's long easy
strokes of 34 to the minute began to
show results.
Washington led by two boat lengths
at the end of the mile, and at half dis
tance had increased her lead to four
lengths of open water. California started
to sprint during the last quarter mile,
but Washington, continuing her stroke
of 32 to the minute, crossed the finish
line a little over ten boat lengths in the
lead.
California did not finish the course be
cause of a mishap to Sesnon, rowing
number six in the California shell, who
collapsed and fell into the water. He
was picked up and quickly revived.
Washington's victory last Saturday as
sured them the honor of representing the
Pacific coast in the annual national re
gatta at Poughkeepsie in June.
