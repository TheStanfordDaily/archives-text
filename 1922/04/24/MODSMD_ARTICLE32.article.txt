# Side-Lights On The Meet
## 
### 
The crowd Saturday was one of the
largest that lias witnessed a track meet
at Stanford or California in the past ten
years.
I
Walt Christie, Bruin coach, in accept
ing the touring car given him by mem
bers of the Big C Society, said that his
mind was more on the relay than on the
car. It might well have been, for Christie
had predicted his -team would win by
twenty-five points, and at that time Cali
fornia had to take the relay to tie the
score.
Point winner# in former Big Meets
didn't fare so well Saturday. "Brick"
Muller, high point man at Stanford last,
year with 16, only took one first and a
third for 6. Merchant, who gathered in
12 or so two years ago, made 4. Kirksey,
a 10-point man usually, got only 3, and
Hutchison a like number.
Scofield, picked by some to win the
half, ran quite a ways farther than the
rest. He stayed in the third lane about
all the way. Although he had some re
serve left for tlie finish he couldn't keep
up with the others' fast spurts.
Charley Dorr of the Bears just gal
loped around on the final lap of the two
mile grind. He stuck around with
Knowlton, his teammate, until the final
curve, and then romped down the final
stretch as if he were finishing a quarter
mile. The pace was a bit too fast for
Myers, the Cardinal entry.
The "breaks" were about evenly di
vided between the two teams. The Blue
and Gold claim that the absence of Van
Sant in the hurdles and Hutchison's
sickness hampered them. Howell and
Kirksey were on the injured list for the
Cardinal. Graham, California pole
vaulter, was injured while jumping and
was forced to quit.
Saturday was probably the last time
the present Berkeley oval will be the
scene of a Cardinal-Bruin meet, as the
California stadium, with a new track,
should be ready by 1924.
