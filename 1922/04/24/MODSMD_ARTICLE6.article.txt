# WAR OF CLASSES IS PROBABLE, BABBIIT SAYS IN LAST TALK
## 
### 
Class wars, if the present conception
of liberty as unrestrained individualism
persists, were predicted by Professor
Babbitt, of Harvard University, in his
closing lecture Friday night in the Little
Theatre. "The result of no restrictions
upon man's natural desires and impulses
is not an Arcadia of 'Liberty, Fraternity,
and Equality,' but an emergence of the
'Will to Power' which inevitably leads
to intense nationalism, imperialism, and
class war. Real justice, which recog
nized only two classes, the righteous and
the wrongdoers, has given way to the so
called justice which takes cognizance of
economic classes. And where class jus
tice is, class wars follow."'
Strong condemnation of the large mass
of laws that is now being turned out by
the American legislatures was expressed
by the speaker. In his opinion, the mod
ern practice of attempting ttf correct
evils by legislative enactment fails to
reach the evils at their source, namely,
the individual. The Rousseauistic phil
osophy that evil is foreign to man's na
ture and that it is present in man be
cause of social institutions, naturally
leads to the conclusion on the part of the
lawmakers that evil can be eradicated by
merely cahnging the institutions.
The greatest peril of democracy lies,
according to Professor Babbitt, in its
inappreciation of the value of the critical
spirit. Democracies are gullible; they
can not distinguish between their friends
and their flatterers.
Conventions and standards of action
must again be set up; the "ethical will"
must again be developed to serve as a
check upon our individualism, if we arc
to have a spiritual reconstruction and a
saving of our western civilization, in
Professor Babbitt's opinion. "In the
final analysis," he said, "it is a question
of education. We must teach our young
to form civilized habits. But how can
this be done as long as educators can not
agree what arc civilized habits?"
