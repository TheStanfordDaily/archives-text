# CAPELLA CHOIR TO GIVE SACRED MUSIC TOMORROW EVENING
## 
### 
The Capella Choir from the College of
the Pacific, consisting of twenty-five
voices, will give a concert jointly with
Warren D. Allen, university organist, in
the chancel of Memorial Church, Tues
day evening at 8 o'clock. Charles M.
Dennis will direct the production. The
chorus will perform entirely without ac
companiment, and will sing three types
of medieval choral music: the old choral
or medieval songs, the Russian, and the
English.
During the Middle Ages before the
organ came into use, the chorus was al
ways unaccompanied, and the same cus
tom also prevailed in Russia and Eng
land. The music has beautiful simplicity
and is exquisite in tone. " '
The concert is unusual in its character,
and distinctly unique. A large crowd is
expected both from the campus and out
of town, and it will be advisable there
fore to come early in order to secure a
good seat.
