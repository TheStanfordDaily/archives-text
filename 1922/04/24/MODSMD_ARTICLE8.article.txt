Stanford made a clean sweep of the
southern California inter-collegiate
tennis tournament held at Ojai last
week, winning both the singles and
doubles title. In the singles tourney,
the finals were played between two
Cardinal players. Only once before in
the history of thu tournaments have
two players representing the same uni
versity met in the finals like this.
111 the singles event, Jimmie Davies
won permanent possession of the Ojai
Inter-collegiate singles cup, by taking
his match in the finals from Phil Neer,
6-3, 5-7, 6-4. Davies previously held
the cup in 1918 as a member of the
Hollywood Junior College and in 1920,
representing Stanford.

defeated Ellison of California Tech.,
6-0, 6-2, in the first round, while Paul
Greene, of U. S. C., was downed in the
second round, 6-2, -64. Dave Conrad
of the Blue and Gold Squad was met
in the semi-finals and offered Davies
the best competition of the tourney,
the Cardinal player winning after
three set, 6-3, 0-6, 6-4. In his match
with Neer, Davies played exceptional
tennis, placing the ball in all corners
of the court.
One of the features of the tourney
was the defeat of Wallace Bates of
California in the semi-finals, by Phil
Neer. The Stanford captain showed
a reversal of form exhibited in the
dual meet a week before and had but
little trouble in winning, 6-2, 6-4. In
the preliminary bouts, Neer defeated
Schugart of California Tech, 6-0, 6-1,
and Stanley Welsh of U. S. C., 5-7, 6-0,
and 6-4.

Cardinal team of Neer and Davies, the
Stanford pair defeating the U. S. C.
