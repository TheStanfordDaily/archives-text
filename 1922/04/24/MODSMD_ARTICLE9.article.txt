# CONSTRUCTION WORK ON CONCESSIONS FOR VANITY FAIR STARTS
## 
### 
First intimations of the architecture of
Vanity Fair were given today. Ham
mers, saws, and pliers were brought to
Encina gymnasium enclosure, and actual
construction wa sstarted on the thirty or
more concession booths for the 1922 car
nival, under Chet Douglas, building di
rector. Locations were assigned the or
ganizations and the design under which
Vanity hair will be laid out was ex
plained. This plan calls for a grand
promenade down the center of the en
closure, on which most of the booths
will face, and is to have lesser streets
branching from it.
Construction work will continue at top
speed until Friday. Director Douglas
announces that all organizations must
start erection of booths immediately, 'in
order to allow time for special work of
the Vanity Fair design to be started soon
enough before opening on Friday eve
ning. Lumber is to secured from the
football bleachers and that left from the
pavilion, and canvas such as was used
last year will be supplied. All special
materials, such as back-drops, curtains,
and so forth, must be provided by the
organizations themselves; ordinary con
struction materials will be supplied by
the carnival committee.
Stages for eight dancing and chorus
productions, similar to the Pi Beta Phi-
Alpha Delta Phi concession last year,
must be erected, and preliminary con
struction was started this afternoon. The
Fijis' shoot-the-chntes is well under way,
with details of the scaffolding, boats,
pulleys, etc., completly mapped out and
building started.
No stage is to he built for the Ram's
Head ballet, as the production this year
is to be much more elaborate, and will
come as the climax o the carnival, at
the Vanity Fair ball in the pavilion Sat
urday night. Rehearsals started Friday,
with a cast including Gene Trago and
Dick Pershing as principals, and a chorus
of eight, consisting of Gertrude McLeod,
Dorothy Williams, Evelyn Huntington,
Ruth Wierrick, Pauline Stanton, Dorothy
Dahlcr, Frances Foster, and Frances
Thompson. The production is being
staged under the direction of Hollis
Chalmers and Ned Prather.
