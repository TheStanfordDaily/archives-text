that was!
It had everyone going! Many a Blue and Gold heart
trembled when Minsky jumped 22-7, and more than a few
cheerers of the Red watched Hendrixon gain a part of the
Kuppenheimer space he was foxed out of by the plucky "Blink" earlier in

.
Every day more people are wearing Kuppenheimer Good
Clothes. They recognize the firm materials and excellent
tailoring that enables these clothes to last in the pinches
like that Stanford team came through in the pinch last Sat
urday. Buy these good clothes for longer wear —and they
will loo"k as good in six months as the day you buy them.
