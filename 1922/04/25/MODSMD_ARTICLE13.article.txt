Softly sliding sylphs slipping in
swinging symmetry to the sleezy sym
phony of saxaphonic syncopation;
sleeply sloe eyes swirling softly—oh,
slush!
Even so. For two night the rulers
of the campus, the king and queen of
the Carnival, will reign over a sway
ing kaleidoscope of figures, a gigantic
sea of motion devoted to terpsiehore,
A luminous archway, stretching from
Vanity Fair grounds to the gaily deck
ed pavilion, will deal to the scene—
the Vanity Fair Fidget, opening the
lightsome ceremonies on Friday night,
and —ahh —the Frivolity Fete!
Of course. Closing the 1922 Carni
val in a flash of splendor, the "Parade
of Pride," Ram's Head's freshman
Follies chorus, will dance across the
boards in the opening number of the
festivities program. For Frivolity
Fete, the grand finale of Vanity Fair
on Saturday night, is to be the Mecca
for devotees of the dance, the place
where pleasure seekers may while the
last hours of the Carnival away, enter
tained by sprightly maidens in gorge
ous costumes and moving to the sooth
ing strains of Mose Granstead's aug
mented Carvinal orchestra. All this
for a dollar, ladies free.
