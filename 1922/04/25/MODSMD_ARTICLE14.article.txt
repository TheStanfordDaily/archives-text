# STUDENTS DESIGN PAGEANT POSTERS
## All-Day Rehearsal to Include Entire Cast of Production is Scheduled For Saturday 
### 
Art posters, the signal 1 work of the j
commercial art - class taught by Emile i
Grebs, advertising the Women's Page- j
ant, were put up on the campus and
in Palo Alto yesterday.
There are thirteen of the posters in
all. They were made by J. H. Mc-
Creery, Estella liorsholt, Helen Harris,
Janice Dunker, Helen Paulsen, Evelyn
Olsen, Andrew Hill, Mercedes Hill,
Wanda Leach, Harry Kennedy, Ted Van i
Deusen, Lloyd Podesta, and Margue- i
rite Tedford.
Grebs conies down from San Fran
cisco once a week to lecture to the
class, supervise its work and assign
problems to be worked out during the j
week. The plot of the pageant was I
read to the artists and they constructed
the posters to characterize some feature
of it.
The special feature of the posters is
their brilliant coloring. One by Ted
Van Deusen represents in bright reds a
Roman soldier who seems to be the per
sonification of strength and vigor. J. H.
McCreery has done a vista of a Roman
wall over the top of which are visible
the plumes on the helmets of soldiers
who are- marching by on the other side.
There are several posters which take
dancing nymphs as their motif. The
Pipes of Pan by Helen Harris is an
other unusual poster.
An all-day rehearsal of all parts of
the pageant has been announced for
Saturday. Practices will be from 9 to
12 in the morning and from one to
three in the afternoon. This will be the
first time that all the cast dancers and
pantomime parts have been assembled
for a rehearsal.
