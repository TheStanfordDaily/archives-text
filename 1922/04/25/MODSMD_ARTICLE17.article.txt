# ELLSWORTH TELLS JOYS OF WRITING IN ASSEMBLY TALK
## Only Way to Learn Game is to Write, Publisher Says in Relating Actual Experience 
### 
"The only way to learn to write is to
write," said William Webster Ellsworth,
former president of the Century Pub
lishing Company, in his address on "The
Joy of Writing," in the Assembly Hall
this morning. "Every young person has
the right to express his own individ
uality in writing and he should not be
hindered from doing it. It is learning
to express your own thoughts, to love
hooks, and to appreciate literature that
brings happiness," he continued.
Mr. Ellsworth, who for thirty-seven
years was connected with the Century
Company, based the substance of his ad
dress on actual experiences with writers
and their work. "The publisher gets
his rewards in numbers," he said. "Al
though he does not contribute creative
work to literature, he has a share in
producing that work."
Some people possess the gift of writ
ing, Mr. Ellsworth pointed out, and they
should not he afraid to try themselves
by actual writing. The writers of the
future must come from this generation
and beginners should not shrink from
the criticism which will aid them in
writing.
"Robert Louis Stevenson is an ex
ample of a writer who accomplished a
great amount of work in a short life
time —all of his work being done in
sixteen years," said Mr. Ellsworth in
speaking of a number of famous literary
personalities he has known. Mark
Twain was one of the most interesting
figures of whom he spoke. "Mark
Twain possessed almost a super-human
imagination." he said. "It was easier
for him to make up a story than to tell
a true one."
"One of the joys of writing," con
tinued the speaker, "is creating beauty.
There is more than meaning in words,
there is the beauty of sound, and the
effect of putting words together. Books
and dictionaries are at your hand to use
for the equisite combinations of words.
It is through such combinations that the
characters of literature become living
creatures in the homes of the readers."
Mr. Ellsworth spoke of the conflicting
ideas in regard to the influence of a col
lege education on authorship. One sur
vey shows that of a number of suc
cessful writers twenty-nine attended
college, while thirty-one did not. "Gen
eral college culture increased the pow
ers of Lowell, but it would have hamp
ered the style of Mark Twain or Walt
Whitman. Creative writing cannot be
taught, but it can be inspired."
A list of English writers shows a pre
ponderance of college-trained men, said
Mr. Ellsworth. In the opinion of a
number of short story writers in this
country, nine were against short story
classes in college, while seven favored
them, with qualifications regarding the
method of giving the courses and the
natural qualifications of those taking
them.
Mr. Ellsworth advised the use of a
"commonplace book" for aspiring writ
ers to be used daily for various types of
writing. "Mark Twain always carried
two books," he said, "one to read and
one to write in. Style is acquired only
as you write."
Journalism has in many cases been a
stepping stone for well-known writers,
according to Mr. Ellsworth. He spoke
especially of the large number of Stan
ford graduates, are now successful
writers, who started in this way.

especially of the large number of Stan
ford graduates, are now successful
writers, who started in this way.
"The only way to learn to write is to
write," said William Webster Ellsworth,
former president of the Century Pub
lishing Company, in his address on "The
Joy of Writing," in the Assembly Hall
this morning. "Every young person has
the right to express his own individ
uality in writing and he should not be
hindered from doing it. It is learning
to express your own thoughts, to love
hooks, and to appreciate literature that
brings happiness," he continued.
Mr. Ellsworth, who for thirty-seven
years was connected with the Century
Company, based the substance of his ad
dress on actual experiences with writers
and their work. "The publisher gets
his rewards in numbers," he said. "Al
though he does not contribute creative
work to literature, he has a share in
producing that work."
Some people possess the gift of writ
ing, Mr. Ellsworth pointed out, and they
should not he afraid to try themselves
by actual writing. The writers of the
future must come from this generation
and beginners should not shrink from
the criticism which will aid them in
writing.
"Robert Louis Stevenson is an ex
ample of a writer who accomplished a
great amount of work in a short life
time —all of his work being done in
sixteen years," said Mr. Ellsworth in
speaking of a number of famous literary
personalities he has known. Mark
Twain was one of the most interesting
figures of whom he spoke. "Mark
Twain possessed almost a super-human
imagination." he said. "It was easier
for him to make up a story than to tell
a true one."
"One of the joys of writing," con
tinued the speaker, "is creating beauty.
There is more than meaning in words,
there is the beauty of sound, and the
effect of putting words together. Books
and dictionaries are at your hand to use
for the equisite combinations of words.
It is through such combinations that the
characters of literature become living
creatures in the homes of the readers."
Mr. Ellsworth spoke of the conflicting
ideas in regard to the influence of a col
lege education on authorship. One sur
vey shows that of a number of suc
cessful writers twenty-nine attended
college, while thirty-one did not. "Gen
eral college culture increased the pow
ers of Lowell, but it would have hamp
ered the style of Mark Twain or Walt
Whitman. Creative writing cannot be
taught, but it can be inspired."
A list of English writers shows a pre
ponderance of college-trained men, said
Mr. Ellsworth. In the opinion of a
number of short story writers in this
country, nine were against short story
classes in college, while seven favored
them, with qualifications regarding the
method of giving the courses and the
natural qualifications of those taking
them.
Mr. Ellsworth advised the use of a
"commonplace book" for aspiring writ
ers to be used daily for various types of
writing. "Mark Twain always carried
two books," he said, "one to read and
one to write in. Style is acquired only
as you write."
Journalism has in many cases been a
stepping stone for well-known writers,
according to Mr. Ellsworth. He spoke
especially of the large number of Stan
ford graduates, are now successful
writers, who started in this way.
