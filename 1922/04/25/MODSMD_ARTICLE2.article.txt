brainy case-running and a temporary j

Battery, with Mertz, Reed, and Bruce
doing the heavy work for Beta Theta

ing a precarious lead throughout the
game. The only long hit of the game
went to Tussing, who poled out a Babe

hits were singles.
Seven home runs in a single game
is the second established by Kappa
Sigma, incidental to a defeat over
Theta Chi by a22to 1 score. Rogers
and Conover were the most consistent
hitters, with a pair of circuit blows
apiece, and Aid and Powell led the j
scoring with five trips across the plate.,
Rogers and Spires were at the points
for Kappa Sigma, and Blosser and
Franklin for Theta Chi.
The end of the Varsity and Fresh
man schedules has released two I
regular diamonds for the use by the I
intramural nines. League Three has
been transferred from the old football i
gridiron to the Freshman field, and
League Four will henceforth pastime
in the Varsity ball park. This allows:
two leagues to use perfect diamonds,
and the other three now have fairly
open playing fields, with no obstacles
save the slippery condition of tho turf,
which will be improved if possible.
There are no games scheduled for
Tuesday afternoon.
