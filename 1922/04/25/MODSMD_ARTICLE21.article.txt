Another view-point in the Daily says that the price
of luncheon is too high. Ile says that many students
are being driven to go to Palo Alto to lunch because
of the fact that they do not wish to pay fifty cents
for lunch. He brings out that the matter is not
any fault with the fifty-cent lunch as far as it goes,
but the main cause of discontent lies in the fact that
the average student does not want so much for lunch
as he gets in the half-dollar meal. What he wants
is just a light repast of one course and one that he
can select from a number of dishes. This he had at
the Inn and he misses the service now that the Inn
is gone.
When the two old dining rooms closed down it
was thought that the one in the old Union could be
made into a dairy lunch cafeteria at once to take
the place, as far as light meals goes, of the Inn.
That proved impracticable with the facilities, so for
the time being there had to he only one dining room.
As soon as possible, however, there will he a light
lunch room put in the basement of the old Union
and the choice of dishes will be offered there the
same as in the old Inn, in the same modern, cleanly
way that characterizes the service in the dining
rooms of the present Union cafe. There the student
who wishes only a small lunch will be able to satisfy
his taste without paying a ilat rate and getting more
than lie wants. This ought to take care of all the
complaints that arise out of the present system of
table d'hote service.
