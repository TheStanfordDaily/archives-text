If students are satisfied with the present general
three-day examination schedule, this particular com
ment will be of no interest. Members of the Law
School have never been satisfied with the prevailing
program of finals.
They pointed out that while a normal being may
possibly be capable of writing thoroughly on two
five-hour three months' "culture" courses in any
one day, he cannot do so with two professional legal
subjects. Students quite frequently become "goofv"
at the end of one four-hour struggle, and when two
examinations of the harder variety present them
selves on one day, headaches and other physical
handicaps become very noticeable by the middle of
the afternoon.
Furthermore, the scheme presented a most unfair
luck element. Two students ifiay have "Evidence"
in the afternoon ex. One of them may have "Equity"
in the forenoon of the same day. The latter must
divide the preparation of the evening before, take
one final in the morning, which in the case put will
leave him no energy; then he must go the afternoon
in "Evidence" on what he has left. The first student
has had the morning free for preparation; he has
been troubled with no physical or mental exertion;
he has no handicap. The two take "Evidence," and
their papers are graded on a com punitive basis. It
is quite like running a 220 man over a quarter mile
before starting him against a fresh athlete in the
furlong, and basing his chances on staying in the
University on the result.
The law students pointed these things out to their
faculty niÂ§n, who saw the viewpoint, and eliminated
the two-exes-in-one-day possibility. If other depart
ments feel the same way, their faculties are no less
reasonable. If the feeling is general, the problem is
for the Academic Council. The place to take tip the
matter is in departmental organizations of any kind.
