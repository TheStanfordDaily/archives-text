Glue Blub Scores
Big Hit

Singing with marvelous tone quality and splendid
interpretation and beautiful simplicity (dwell on that)
and remarkable vigor and several other good phrases
I won't be able to remember until I find my concert
program scrap book, the Glue Blub, of which I am a
member, knocked a stupendous audience out of their
seats in a recent concert. None of the seats were
damaged. Under the able direction of the Director, the
paid admissions were refunded without a panic.—Advt.

G. Blub Scores On
Big Hit
Gripping the bludgeon with a half-score of vise-like
digits, G. "Gee" Blub, '89, addressed the plate, calling
it a dish-face and whiffed the first horsehide offered
into a gallop over the Dye-works bleachers driving in
three tallies before him and putting the game on ice,
from which it may be taken for a review of bingles by
any inquisitive coroner.

Big Mitt
G. Lou Blubb, talking before 19,000 students and an
Econ. major expressed as nis opinion, "On the last
analysis a big mitt is all to the uh-uh! However, just as
Cuticura will polish nails, the last analysis will be
performed for you if you try to polish girders— particu
larly those girders which gird up loins —porg loins." ,
G. Lou Blubb continued, addressing the Econ major.

The word "scud"! Faugh. A coarse, guttural sound,

Seeing as how an Ad Club has been formed, it seems
only right, fellers, that we all ought to chip in and
form a few more clubs. Every Student a Club Member!
should be our motto, and we shouldn't rest until it is
fulfilled. There could be an Eight O'clock Club for
those who insist on getting to 8 o'clock on time. There
could be a Late Club formed of those commuters who
are consistent in missing their cars and trains.
What about a Finals Club, whose members should
be exempt from all final examination. Of course, only
those not registered in the University could belong to
such an organization, but the idea is worth reading,
at any rate. Think it over, fellers, and let us know
how you stand! Even a club-footed man could have a

G. Blub Scores On
Big Hit
Gripping the bludgeon with a half-score of vise-like
digits, G. "Gee" Blub, '89, addressed the plate, calling
it a dish-face and whiffed the first horsehide offered
into a gallop over the Dye-works bleachers driving in
three tallies before him and putting the game on ice,
from which it may be taken for a review of bingles by

Seeing as how an Ad Club has been formed, it seems
only right, fellers, that we all ought to chip in and
form a few more clubs. Every Student a Club Member!
should be our motto, and we shouldn't rest until it is
fulfilled. There could be an Eight O'clock Club for
those who insist on getting to 8 o'clock on time. There
could be a Late Club formed of those commuters who
are consistent in missing their cars and trains.
What about a Finals Club, whose members should
be exempt from all final examination. Of course, only

such an organization, but the idea is worth reading,
