POiNCARE THREATENS TO
COERCE GERMANY
In a speech delivered at Bar le Due,
Premier Poincare of France threaten
ed to quit the Genoa Conference un
less more attention were paid to the
French point of view. In a reply to
the charge of Imperialism, now so fre
quently brought against France, he
pointed out the possible effect of the
Russo-German alliance. If France
should disband its army, Russia and
Germany working together would con
trol the destiny of Europe.
The provisions of the Treaty of Ver
sailles, he says must be enforced.
France demands no more but if the
Germans fail to meet the conditions
set by the reparations commission it
is the duty of the Allies to compel
them to do so. If need be France will
undertake the task alone.
Premier Lloyd George plans to re
turn to London next Saturday. This
is taken as an indication of greater
harmony in the conference for it is
not likely he would leave if there were
a probability of violent discord.
NEW SOLDIERS' BONUS SCHEME
Senator McCumber, the chairman
of the Senate Finance Committee has
introduced a measure as a substitute
for the soldiers' bonus bill which was
passed by the house. The new plan
is to spread payments over a greater
length of time and to decrease the
amount to be spent for that purpose
during the first year from three hun
dred million dollars to one hundred
million. The new scheme seems to
be quite popular in the Senate. How
ever, President Harding is opposed
to any measure which does not pro
vide for the raising of revenue to meet
the expenses and since Senator Mc-
Cumber's plan does not provide for
a method of financing it is not much
more likely to receive the President's
signature than was the House Bill.
