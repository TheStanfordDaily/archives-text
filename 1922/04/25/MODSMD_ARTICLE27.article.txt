# EDUCATOR TELLS OF STUDENT MOVEMENT AND LIFE IN CHINA
## 
### 
"Studnt Life and the Student Move
ment in China" was the subject of a talk
given by Nga Van Yue, '22, last night
before the Cosmopilitan Club.
The lack of national unity was China's
greatest drawback until very recently,
according to Yue. But the Shantung
incident and the resulting student move
ment have tended to remedy this. Yue
told of 3,000 students who were arrested
in Peking alone, for having opposed the
Shantung policy of the national govern
ment, and how these students, since the
iail- could not hold them all, were
confined to the Peking University build
ings, around which guards were sta
tioned. Later, when the government
wanted to release them, these students
refused to leave their prison, de
manding that the president of China
first send them an apology. This he did.
Yue related the origin of the present
National Student Movement, which in
clude- students of all the provinces, and
whose purposes are to keep a watchful
eye on the corrupt governmental officials
and to carry on constructive work over
all China in the economic, social, and
political fields.
A short business meeting followed.
