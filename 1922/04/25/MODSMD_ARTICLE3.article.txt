# Four Freshmen Trip Up On Law While Putting Up Placards On Poles
##

—And then they were flung into
durance vile! The minions of the law
had laid violent hands on their tender
innocence, and hailed them summarily
to court for defiance to the laws of
the commonwealth or some such thing.
For four foolish freshmen, on plea
sure bent, took the wropg turn yester
day afternoon. They carried with
them a noble purpose and 200 posters,
which they began to wrap engaging
ly about telephone poles in a nearby
metropolis. All went well until —
hist! An officer came around [the
corner. He saw them. They saw
him. They saw each other. Then
he saw the poster. It said "Are you
vain ?"
That settled it. The yearlings were
yanked before the chief. They were
thrown into jail. But that wasn't the
worst. They were forced to listen
to a lecture by the supreme authority,
to the ultimate effect that it was
against the law to put up posters for
Vanity Fair, or anything else, on tele
phole poles in Palo Alto.
