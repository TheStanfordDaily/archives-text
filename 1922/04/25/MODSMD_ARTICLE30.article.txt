# APRIL CARDINAL WILL GO ON SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Is a college meant for activities or
study? Archie Binns, '22, discusses this
question in the April edition of the Car
dinal, which will be on sale on the
campus tomorrow.
Harold Davis, '23. who is known in
literary circles for his work in "Poetry
and Poet Lore," has contributed a page
of verse to the Cardinal. An article on
Philippine Problems by Fred Fisher,
'24, gives many sidelights on the condi
tions in the islands drawn from his
own experiences.
