# Circle "S" Society Plans For Novel Entertainment
## 
### 
The Circle "S" society is planning
something new in entertainment at
dances on June 3, when they plan
to give a dance at this time with
feature stunts during the evening. It
is probable that boxing, wrestling,
fencing, and other athletic exhibitions
of this kind will form the main part
of the program.
The proceeds will go toward a
trophy case for the university. If they
can get enough money before the end
of the year, the case will be construct
ed in some prominent place, probably
in the lobby of the Union or a suit
able spot in "the Library.
