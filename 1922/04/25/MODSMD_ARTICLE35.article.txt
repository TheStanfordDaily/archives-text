Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
In view of the fact that every man
student in the University is paying $5 a
quarter toward the support of his share
of physical education, and in view of
the fact that the present policy seems
to indicate that rugby, soccer, and other
sports would be done away with in or
der to concentrate on American foot
ball, isn't it only fair to every man that
the Board of Control make a statement
of their policy? If each student pays $5
for the support of I'ncina Gymnasium—■
and believing that he will get some ben
efit from it—why shouldn't he know the
policy of the Athletic Board of Control
in handling this $10,000 or so, given to
them to spend by the students?
Another question is: Will American
football be the only activity conducted
in the fall months? Haven't the large
number of men who are out in 'rugby,
soccer, and other sports" just as much
claim as, say, the 50 big men in Amer
ican football? Is the future policy —
ican football? Is the narrow-minded
American football ? Is the narrow-minded
policy—and is it backed by the Board of
Control? Give us, who are not interest
ed in playing American football, some
knowledge of what the $5 per quarter
is being used for, and what it is going
to be used for—and what activities it is
going to be pay for. Most certainly if
there are 50 men in American football,
the rest have just as much right to be
trained in the activity in which they can
be interested, or the one for which they
are best fitted.
