# SACRED CONCERT TO BE GIVEN IN CHURCH
## College of the Pacific Choir Will Present Choral Music In Church This Evening 
### 
A special sacred concert will begin
tonight in Memorial Church, by a
chorus composed of twenty-five trained
voices from the College of the Paci
fic, under the direction of Charles M.
Dennis, Acting Head of the Conserva
tory of Music.
Such old masters as Plasterina of
Italy, Vittoria of Spain, and Sweelinck
in the Netherlands, who were con
sidered supreme masters of their art
during the "Golden Age of Choral
Music," will form one group of selec
tions. The earliest of the Medieval
Motests dates back from the 15th
century. The realistic atmosphere and
setting for the production of the old
choral numbers is preserved by the
fact that there will be no organ ac
companiment', the organ being un
known at the time the music was
written. The choir will also be gown
ed in their vestments and will sing
from the Chancel of the Church.
The Russian numbers are charac
terized particularly by their brilliance,
vigor and sonority of tone, represent
ing most successfully the Palestrina
fdeal of modern music. The organ is
unnecessary and unknown in Russian
service.
Alternating with the choral groups,
Warren D. Allen, University Organist,
will play organ selections from both
the classic and modern schools.
