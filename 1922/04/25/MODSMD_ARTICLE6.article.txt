# FOLLIES OF CARNIVAL STARTS REHEARSALS
## Two Vanity Fair Concessions Offer To Carry All Expenses 
### 
In an effort to secure the silver cup offered by the Carnival committee,
two organizations presenting concessions in Vanity Fair have offered to pay
all expenses of putting on their stunt. Delta Gamma and Phi Delta Theta,
offering "the Follies of Vanity Fair," a flippant flight of fancy with chorus
and dance specialty numbers, including complete costumes for every act, and
Encina Club, with "Coo Coo Cutie," a mysterious extravaganza similar to the
Ram's Head show, have raised the money to completely finance all details
of their production.
A special stage is being constructed for the chorus of "The Follies of
Vanity Fair." A glittering galaxy of talent, in musical numbers written by
campus favorites, are to present the frills and foibles of the carnival in three

scenes and a rippling revue, with
specialty acts put on by such stars as
Paul Claflin and Frances Merrill inter
spersed.
Three plots are to be unravelled in
twenty minutes, In the exposure ol'
"Coo Coo Cutie." Nineteen people are
in the cast, not counting an eight-piece
orchestra, four uniformed ushers, and
a lusty announcer in full dress and
top hat. The leading roles are taken
by Everett Swing, at "Cutie," Walter
Broenkow as "Cutie's Cutie," David
Faville as "Demosthenes Skugg," and
Sam Mendenhall as the "Society
Sneak." Rivalling Ram's Head's Bal
let, Encina Club is offering a pony
chorus of nine, every last one of them
freshmen, and a male chorus of four.
The scene is laid in the excess bag
gage room of Roble station. The open
ing chorus, in which the dainty dam
sels enter on a specially constructed
runway, is to be the latest hit which
has been knocking them out on Broad
way. The sequence of scenes is thus:
"The Diamond Necklace," a deep
mystery in which the Society Sneak
slides through on high, the "Balcony
Scene," in which the actors play to
the gallery, and "The Love of a Man
and a Maid," in which the hero is
saved at the last moment.
