# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE TO COME TO CLOSE ON MAY 6
## 
### 
With the conclusion of the spring
sport season Saturday, Coach Warner
received a large number of new men
on his football squad, bringing the
total registration up to one hundred.
Most of the new men are in fair
physical condition, and show an apti
tude and a willingness to learn "that is
encouraging, according to Warner.
None of them have much football
knowledge, but with hard work and
careful coaching they can be brought
up almost to the par of the other men
before the season starts.
A few elementary signals, tackling,
running down punts, simple plays, and
the use of the straight-arm, are occu
pying the attention of coaches and
players from four till six every night.
Thornhill is gradually developing
his line-men in the rudiments of indi
vidual play; co-ordination of the play
ers into a smooth-working whole will
be left until next autumn.
The most difficult task that will face
Coach Kerr and Coach Thornhill next
autumn is finding the right men for
the right position, and in selecting the
men to remain on the squad. Until
the coaches get to know the differ
ent candidates personally, selection is,
to a certain extent, done blindly.
Discussing the squad as a whole,
Coach Warner seems well-satisfied
with the material that has turned out;
it is not exceptional but with careful
development it has many possibilities.
May 6 has been tentatively set as
the date for closing spring practice,
unless it seems that the men can re
ceive more valuable training in one or
two weeks more.
