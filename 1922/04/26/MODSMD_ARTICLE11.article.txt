# VARSITY BASEBALL PLAYERS ARE HAVING TWO-WEEK LAY OFF
## 
### 
Two weeks of layoff from all prac
tice has been given the varsity baseball
squad, following the conclusion of the
series with California Saturday.
At the end of this period practice will
be resumed, and games with some out
side teams will probably be played. This
will all be in preparation for the trip
to Honolulu, which will take place dur
ing the last of June. Just who will go
to the Hawaiian Islands is not vet
known, as some who were originally
scheduled for the trip may not be able
to go. There will be about fourteen
men taken, including, in all probability,
an extra catcher, one or two extra pitch
ers. and a couple of general utility men
who can be used either in the infield
or outfield as the occasion demands.
Regular intercollegiate competition
has ceased for this season, as the Cali
fornia series marked the climax of the
long list of games through which~~tbe
varsity plowed during March and April.
Any contents that may take place in
| order to get the team in shape for the
summer trip will be made as additions
to the regular schedule that was pre
pared at the first of the season.
