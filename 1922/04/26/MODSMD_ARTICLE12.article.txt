Unique in its method of portrayal,
varied in tone production and in the
character of the different choral
groups, was the concert given last
evening by the A. Capella Choir of
thirty-five voices from the College of
the Pacific, in the Memorial Church.
The old choral music offered un
usual opportunity for work in the dif
ferent parts, and the voices of the
singers blended in rich and perfect
harmony throughout the performance.
With the exception of a few slight
hesitancies in the second group of
mediaeval songs, there was little critic
ism to be offered of the production.
This ,group was characterized par
ticularly by its ethereal beauty and
simplicity. In Sweelinck's "Born
Today," there was a loftiness of style,
which is typical of the author.
The choir sang from the chancel of
the Church and wore vestments, which
created atmosphere and an artistic
setting for the production. In speak
ing of the method of training the
chorus, Charles M. Dellis, Director,
said, "It is only by repeated rehearsals,
and the most careful training that
such harmony of voices, without the
aid of the instrumental music, may
be effected."
Perhaps the most enjoyable group
of songs on the program were the
Russian choral songs, which had a
brilliance and deep, organ-like quality
of tonft Dignity, pathos, and a ma
jesty of theme were characteristic in
the rendition of "Angus Dei," and
the "Only Begotten Son."
An interesting contrast is observed
between the Russian and the English
choral music, in that with the former,
the organ was unknown, while in Eng
land n.e organ was used to iome ex
tent. The four authors in the last
group oi English choral songs have
specialized in this type of music and
are among the most noted of English
musicians. Although lacking in the
characteristic dramatic quality of the
Russian, the English choral music
possesses a dignified beauty and rich
ness of tone.
While offering an effective contrast,
the classic organ selections which
Warren D. Allen played at intervals
during the concert, were particularly
well-chosen and blended beautifully
with the music of the choral group.
Tbe "Passacaglia" by Bach, was im
pressive and majestic in tone, con
taining a wealth in variety of rhythm.
The fugue which comes at the climax,
brings the composition to a dramatic
cJoce. Rubinstein's "Music of the
Spheres," charmed the audience with
its ethereal beauty and exquisite tone
quality. No more need be said than
that the composition was essentially
what its title suggested.

of songs on the program were the
Russian choral songs, which had a
brilliance and deep, organ-like quality
of tonft Dignity, pathos, and a ma
jesty of theme were characteristic in
the rendition of "Angus Dei," and
the "Only Begotten Son."
An interesting contrast is observed
between the Russian and the English
choral music, in that with the former,
the organ was unknown, while in Eng
land n.e organ was used to iome ex
tent. The four authors in the last
group oi English choral songs have
specialized in this type of music and
are among the most noted of English
musicians. Although lacking in the
characteristic dramatic quality of the
Russian, the English choral music
possesses a dignified beauty and rich
ness of tone.
While offering an effective contrast,
the classic organ selections which
Warren D. Allen played at intervals
during the concert, were particularly
well-chosen and blended beautifully
with the music of the choral group.
Tbe "Passacaglia" by Bach, was im
pressive and majestic in tone, con
taining a wealth in variety of rhythm.
The fugue which comes at the climax,
brings the composition to a dramatic
cJoce. Rubinstein's "Music of the
Spheres," charmed the audience with
its ethereal beauty and exquisite tone
quality. No more need be said than
that the composition was essentially
what its title suggested.
Unique in its method of portrayal,
varied in tone production and in the
character of the different choral
groups, was the concert given last
evening by the A. Capella Choir of
thirty-five voices from the College of
the Pacific, in the Memorial Church.
The old choral music offered un
usual opportunity for work in the dif
ferent parts, and the voices of the
singers blended in rich and perfect
harmony throughout the performance.
With the exception of a few slight
hesitancies in the second group of
mediaeval songs, there was little critic
ism to be offered of the production.
This ,group was characterized par
ticularly by its ethereal beauty and
simplicity. In Sweelinck's "Born
Today," there was a loftiness of style,
which is typical of the author.
The choir sang from the chancel of
the Church and wore vestments, which
created atmosphere and an artistic
setting for the production. In speak
ing of the method of training the
chorus, Charles M. Dellis, Director,
said, "It is only by repeated rehearsals,
and the most careful training that
such harmony of voices, without the
aid of the instrumental music, may
be effected."
Perhaps the most enjoyable group
of songs on the program were the
Russian choral songs, which had a
brilliance and deep, organ-like quality
of tonft Dignity, pathos, and a ma
jesty of theme were characteristic in
the rendition of "Angus Dei," and
the "Only Begotten Son."
