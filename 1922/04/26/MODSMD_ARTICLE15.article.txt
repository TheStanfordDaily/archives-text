# DANCERS WILL HONOR GODDESS OF SPRING
## 
### 
One of the principal dances of the
women's Spring Pageant will be a ritual
dance in honor of the goddess Freya,
'which will be given by Randalin's mai
dens Freya is the ancient Celtic god
dess of springtime, of the sowing of
the fields, and of all good things. The
Britain maidens are especially devoted
to her and maintain shrines in her
honor. In the spring of every year
they hold a festival in her name. It is
at the celebration of this date that the
maidens dance this ritual.
The particular maidens who will par
ticipate in the festivities of Freya at
the pageant are the followers of Ran
dalin, the heroine of the plot. They
are Mary Sloan, Margaret Carlsmith,
Mildred Dannenbaum, and Carol Pet
erson.
The Cymbal Dance forms a contrast
with the more primitive ritual of the
Britains, for it is a classic Roman
dance. The Roman maidens who have
come to Britain intend that it shall show
the uncouthness of the native dancers
and try to make it a model of technique
and form. They use brass cymbals
which they clang and clash together in
time to the rythm of the music. The
women who will appear in it are Mabel
McKibben, Barbara Wellington, Enime
line Williams, and Elizabeth Simmons.
The steps for all the dances in the
pageant have been worked out by Miss
Edith Pasmore of the Physical Educa
tion Department. She has planned the
music for them and is coaching the
practices which are held each afternoon
in the Roble Gymnasium.
