# MILITARY STUDIES RE-ARRANGED TO AID FRESHMAN STUDENTS
## 
### 
In order to make it possible for
more first-year men to enroll in the
Military Department, without conflict
ing with the requirements of the
Lower Division, a new schedule of in
struction has been adopted and will
be put into effect in the coming autumn
quarter. Students entering the basic
course are to be enrolled in a class
which will be both practical and theo
retical in its nature, calling for only
three hours a week attendance instead
of six as at present. The advanced
courses will remain substantially the
same.
