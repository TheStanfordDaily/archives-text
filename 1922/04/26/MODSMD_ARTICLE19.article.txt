# ALUMNI ADVOCATE ONE YEAR RUSHING FOR FRATERNITIES
## Freshmen Will Be Pledged in May; Plan to Be Voted on at Next Meet of Chapters 
### 
A year's rushing period for fraterni
ties, called the "May Pledging Sys
tem," by which freshmen will be pled
ged in the eighth week of the Spring
quarter has been worked out by the
Alumni Interfraternity Conference of
San Francisco, in co-operation with a
committee of the local Conference,
and is now being considered by the
Stanford chapters. The system will
be voted 011 at the next meeting of the
Interfraternity Conference 011 Monday
evening, and if acted on favorably will
go into effect next year.
The essential feature of the plan
is the eight months rushing season,
with one pledge-day under an inter
fraternity referee at the end of that,
period. Men subject to "May Pledg
ing" my be pledged informally at any
time after pledge-day, and all men
other than freshmen may be pledged
informally at any time. There shall
be 110 rushing off the campus, and no
freshman shall be permitted to spend
the night in a fraternity house. A
freshman pledged in the spring quar
ter shall not be initiated until he has
registered in the University for some
succeeding quarter. The term "fresh
man" shall mean any man registering
in the University for the first time
between one pledge-day and the next.
The alumni generally feel that the
various systems of rushing tried out
by the fraternities at Stanford during
recent years have not proven satis
factory. On the judgment "May Pledg
ing" is sound in principle, will work
well in practice, and will add an or
derliness and dignity to the matter
of chosing new members for a frater
nity. It is believed also that the plan
will substitute a considered and na
tural selective process for the neces
sarily hasty and somewhat artificial
