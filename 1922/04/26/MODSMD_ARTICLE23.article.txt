# GET BEHIND AND PUSH
## 
### 
Construction work on Vanity Fair is progressing
and going satisfactorily. But it is not being pushed
fast enough. As usual most of the work has to he
done by volunteer labor and it is falling upon a few
who have the interest of the thing at heart to do the
hard jobs in order that the rest of us may have the
enjoyment of an evening on Friday and Saturday.
We are prone to say that the performers are the
ones interested in getting their stages set up so let
them do the work. They are interested from a
matter of necessity, they have to have the places
prepared before they can put on their show. But
we are just as interested, at least should be. This
Carnival, whatever be its name of theme, is the
annual stunt which we put on to finance the sending
of a track squad to the east for the National Cham
pionships.
This year, when we have the brightest chance of
our history to clean up the title in the east, we
should he more closely interested in the work of the
Carnival than ever. We are going to send a big
representation and must have the wherewithal to
make this jjossible. To have this we must put out
a show that will be attractive.
We can easily afford to give some time to the
work down at the gym for the next couple of days
without hurting ourselves. Only by all of us work
ing can we hope to have a successful outcome. We'
don't want any failures.
