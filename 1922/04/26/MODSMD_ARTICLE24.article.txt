# ALL COLLEGES THE SAME

Pride in one's university, says the Oregon Daily
Emerald, is a glorious thing. It grows out of the
maintenance of traditions founded back in the days
when Harvard was but a little college struggling for
an existence with a staff smaller than most of the
.primary schools of today. The traditions breed
loyalty by their observance, and no matter whether
the tradition is over a celebration of a major victory
in the sport world or some slight occurrence which
later became dear to the hearts of the students, the
remembrance of the date brings back a warmth to the
heart of the alumnus after he has gone out from his
alma mater, and makes him live again those days he
spent as an undergraduate. Probably in no other
way is the time of college days brought more forcibly
back to him than when he sees the celebration of
one of the traditions that he observed when he was
a student.
Oregon says that there they have an interest in the
athletics, and interuniversity societies of the other
colleges of the Pacific coast that they meet in con
ference games, and that there the interest ends. But
the thought there is that Oregon is following the
lead of many state institutions in standardizing its
system of instruction to the exclusion of all indi
viduality. This is the thing which is breaking down
the morale of some state colleges, because when a
college, like a human being, is robbed of individ
uality it becomes a humdrum round of daily work
that is nothing more to the student than any job on
the outside.
Fortunately we are not hampered by the bonds
that keep a state college within a certain line. To
do things differently has always been what the Stan
ford curriculum has aimed for. Here we have our
traditions, large and small. Some of them, trivial
and founded in the days when California still

thought we were a private school for boys and girls,
are just as alive today as they were the year that the
first observance was made by the men who at the
time were interested in the acts as matters of seem
ing great moment.
Oregon is fearful lest the societies founded from
a tradition become affiliated with some national
organization. \Ye think this is stretching pro
vincialism pretty far. There is no necessity for
sacrificing the personal part of one's group or tra
ditional associations when they are affiliated with
something of a national character. There is for the
most part only a gain which comes through the
intimate insight into the life of the different sections
of the country that is obtained by close relations
between the members of the different sections.
While we are proud of our traditions in regard to
inculcating loyalty in our hearts we look with favor
on affiliation with outside groups that will bring us
into more intimate touch with the sentiment ex
pressed in other localities than our own.
