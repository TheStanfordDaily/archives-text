was overturned op the freshman leader's head, washing
out the waves. Infuriated, she turned upon her tor
mentors and hurled great lumps of sugar. At this in
hospitable greeting, the sophomores retired, abashed,

present. With smothered snarls of annoyance, they
returned. Brandishing their student body cards and
using severely reprehensible language, they rushed the
ante-room and demanded their money back.
The demand was received coldly, and hot words fol

about to return in a hack when the skulls and snakes
arrived in a body from their various front porches and,
amid the cries of the wounded, declared that there would

Dedicated to Great Grandmother —She's my Mammy's
Mother's Ma.
I been layin' here an' thinkin'
O' the birdies in the trees
And of posies and lumbago
And of canned milk and of fleas.
Here a layin' 'neath this willow
With my toes a pickin' grass
I can see the foamy cloudlets
Which is not at all like Bass'.
Now the sum and whole substance
Of my cerebral reflex
Leads me to some deep conclusions
Which my disposition vex.
For the dew was on the crayfish
And the creak came from the spring
When I had the mental vision
Of which I fain would sing.
So,
If the only wealth is workin'
And the real work's 'neath the rind —
Oh, I hesitate to tell you
For you might be far behind —
Well, my heaviest deduction
Leads me to feel sure that but
For the fact that papers buy this
I should think myself a nut.
* * *
She has a neck like a swan—
Yeh, she's always craning it!
* * *
Hail—the financial genius on the job! Latest pro
posal is to have everybody look up in the air at the
man in the airplane, while the committee collects funds.
Sandbag Sum says his way is easier, though not requir
ing the same skill.

Pause. Do you realize that there are only 47 days
before finals? That within a short time we shall again
be clapping with relief? That we ought to do some
thing about it?

Why not give the profs a real send-off, something
they will remember —a confetti shower, or a sky-rocket?
Think how pleasantly surprised they would be when the
A student of the class pops up with: "Altogether, men,
six for Prof. Pretzel —Aaaarrrgh!"
