ADEQUATE STATE OR PREPARED
NESS URGED
Secretary of War Weeks and Gen
eral Pershing yesterday, before a
Senate Committee, urged that the
army be not reduced below the limit
of 13,000 officers and 150,000 men that
the War Department feels is the mini
mum to which the army can be cut at
the present time. Both officials plead
for a national military policy which
would assure that the United States
in case of emergencies would not be
forced to resort to the wasteful ex
penditures and the consequent econ
omic disturbances which have char
acterized our participation in all past
wars.
SOVIET NOTE TO POLAND
CREATES SENSATION
The Soviet Government yesterday
sent a note to Poland in which the
Russians intimated that Poland had
violated the treaty signed at Riga in
1921 by her action in joining the Al
lies in the protest against the Russo-
German pact. The note stated that
the Riga treaty covered all relations
between Poland and Russia and there
was no reason for the Polish participa
tion in a further discussion of the
Russian affairs. Since Russia has a
large army close to the Polish border
her action virtually amounts to a
threat of war. Due to this note and
the attitude of France as expressed
by Poincare's Bar-le-duc speech, the
Conference again seems to be drifting
onto the rocks.
