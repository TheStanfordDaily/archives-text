# LAND TITLE CRASH IMPORTANT IN EARLY UNIVERSITY HISTORY
## 
### 
Because a Norwegian sea captain
had a number of distant heirs, Stan
ford University was located on the
south side of San Francisquito creek,
and Palo Alto instead of Menlo Park,
became the college town. This is
part of the interesting data relative
to the early history of Stanford which
has been found by the Palo Alto Times,
and which so few today, know about.
The land which the Stanfords se
lected for the university site, was
originally owned by two Irishmen who
settled in Menlo in 1854 as the pos-
a large estate. Their home
stood a little distance from El Camino
Real, to the rear of the gate which
they built and which still stands.
Later the property passed into the
possession of one Captain Peterson,
a retired Norwegian sea captain. At
his death, the property passed on to
his widow, and by the time of her
death, had been almost entirely sold.
The Stanfords had always preferred
Menlo Park to Palo Alto, and it was
only the difficulties which arose over
titles to the land which caused the
Senator to change his plans.
The life of Menlo Park before the
days of the university, was one of
pink teas and horse races. The most
famous stables were owned by Sen
ator Stanford, and on his private track,
some of the fastest horses of the
country were bred and trained. To-
some of the fleetest horses racing
are descendants of the old champions.
The stables at the time overlooked
Lagunita, but all that remains now is
a long, white barn at the upper end of
the lake.
