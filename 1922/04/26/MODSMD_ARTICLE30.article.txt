# IDAHO FRATERNITIES STAGE BATTLE ROYAL
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO, April
25.â€”A "Battle Royal" staged between
men from different fraternities on the
campus proved to be the most interest
ing feature of the I Club smokeless
smoker given last Friday evening in the
University Gym. In this event a man j
from each organization was placed in 1
the ring and allowed to attempt the re-!
moval of any of the other men by any I
means except slugging. The battle was j
fast and furious for several minutes. '
then the number of contestants began to
dwindle, leaving only two pair of men
on the mat. These two final engage-!
ments proved to be as interesting as any i
wrestling match and lasted until the
winner succeeded in rolling his opponent
onto the floor.
