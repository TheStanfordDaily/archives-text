Dear Sir: —A communication pub
lished in your issue of April 25th im
plies that a change has been made by
the Board of Athletic Control in its
policy towards sports other than foot
ball. No such change has been made
or contemplated. The usual activities
will be supported next year to the same
extent as during past seasons, and no
other policy is under consideration. A
complete financial statement is pub
lished every year in the Report on the
Students' Organization Fund, and any
one interested may obtain a copy at my
office. Very truly yours,
J. P. MITCHELL,
Secretary, Board of Athletic Control.
