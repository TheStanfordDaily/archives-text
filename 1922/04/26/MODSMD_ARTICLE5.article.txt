# STRICT OBEDIENCE TO FIGHT RULES NEEDED
## 
### 
An urgent need of strict compliance
with the rules governing the conduct
of the annual sophomore-freshmen
baseball fight on May 1, if the tradi
tion is to be retained, was made by
"Red" Tauzer, '22, representing Skull
and Snakes Society, at a smoker and
business meeting of the sophomore
class held last evening in the old
Union. The rules which must be fol
lowed by both classes, follow:
1. There shall be no kidnaping of
either teams or classmen before the
fight. Neither will there be any
grouping or assembling except in
regularly called class meetings.
2. The fight shall commence some
time during the fifth inning of the
baseball contest when the varsity cap
tain throws the ball into the air. The
fight will last for one hour,, at the
end of which time a pistol will be fired
and all hostilities will cease. The
class which returns th 6 ball will be
declared the winner. If neither side
is successful in returning it, the fight
will be called a tie.
3. All motor cars and vehicles are
forbidden.
4. Infractions by members of either
side will receive summary action by
the Men's Council.
5. Men's Council will exact summary
justice upon violators of the above, who
will be reported by the Varsity "S"
men in charge of the fight. All "S" men
will be on the field Monday.
Tauzer explained some of the details
which Skull and Snake have arranged.
The game between the sophomore and
freshman teams will be called at 4 on
the varsity diamond. The sophomore
spectators will sit along the third-base
line and the frosh will be situated along
the third-base' boundary.
Some time (luring the progress of the
game, Captain George Green will toss
a specially marked ball out on the field.
The idea will be to return it to Captain
Green before an hour has elapsed, keep
ing it at all times within the fence
which surrounds the held. The man
who returns the ball wins for his class
and the man who violates any of the
tight rules concerning relaying the ball
loses for his class.
Tauzer has asked that all "S" men
meet him in front of the Union about
3:45 Monday, in order to arrange the
details of the refereeing.
