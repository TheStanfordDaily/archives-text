# Zoology Classes Herald Forth Extreme Utility of Ordinary Barn Owl
## 
### 
That the common barn owl is an
extremely useful citizen, and further
more that it undoubtedly spends more
time "boning" than the greater part
of students of the institution is prov
en by a discovery recently made by
the members of the zoology classes.
In truth the discovery would indicate
that "boning" must have been the
chief diversion of the bird although
he perhaps derived more pleasure from
this occupation than the average stu
dent would.
However, the find brought to light,
in a pile of discarded bones beneath
the nest of this bird, the remains of
355 gophers, eight mice, two moles,
one shrew, thirty-four small birds, two
large birds and many insects. Quite
a pile of gruesome relics, you will say,
but it is evident that the harm done
by the killing of the birds is undobted
ly more than offset by the large num
ber of gophers dfevoured, for these
animals are serious pests on farms
and gardens.
