# DEAN YOST EXPLAINS EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION HONORS
## 
### 
The number of questions about the
Comprehensove Examination for can
didates for Graduation Honors, which
have come to the attention of Dean
Mory Yost eince the notice was pub
lished .makes it advisable in her
opinion to state again the conditions
under which Graduation Honors are
given:
(a) The degree will be granted
"with distinction" to about one-tenth
of the graduating class. A minimum
grade point average of 2.00 will be re
quired.
(b) The degree will be granted
"with great distinction" to about one
twentieth of the graduating class. A
minimum grade point average of 2.40
will be required.
(d) The grade point average will be
reckoned on the work of the five quar
ters preceding the quarter of gradua
tion. Residence at Stanford for three
quarters is required. Work elsewhere
will be evaluated to conform to Stan
ford standards.
(e) During the five quarters men
tioned in (d), the student must have
completed forty units of work listed
as advanced undergraduate or gradu
ate work.
(112) Degrees "with distinction" and
"with great distinction" are to be dis
tributed among the five groups of de
partments approximately according to
registration.
(g) Recommendations from depart
ments will be requested and used as
in the case of Stanford Scholars.
(h) Each department will be re
quested to offer in the eighth week
of each quarter a comprehensive ex
amination on the undergraduate work
of the department if there are appli
cants for such an examination. Any
record made in this way will be con
sidered by the Committee in making
recommendations for degrees "with
distinction" or "with great distinc
tion."
Thus it will be seen, announces Dean
Yost, that the regulations, first, do
not require a Comprehensive Exami
nation in the major subject; second,
that if this examination is taken, the
result of it, whatever it is, will be
considered as part of the evidence
which the Committee will consider in
choosing the Honor Students.
Those students who wish to take
these Comprehensive Examinations
are requested to leave their names in
the office of the Dean of Women be
fore May 1, so that the Committee can
then present these applications to the
several departments. It rests entirely
with the departments whether or not
the Comprehensive Examinations will
be given.
A complete statement of the rules
for the New Honors System is posted
on the Bulletin Board in the Dean of
Women's office.

nation in the major subject; second,
that if this examination is taken, the
result of it, whatever it is, will be
considered as part of the evidence
which the Committee will consider in
choosing the Honor Students.
Those students who wish to take
these Comprehensive Examinations
are requested to leave their names in
the office of the Dean of Women be
fore May 1, so that the Committee can
then present these applications to the
several departments. It rests entirely
with the departments whether or not
the Comprehensive Examinations will
be given.
A complete statement of the rules
for the New Honors System is posted
on the Bulletin Board in the Dean of
Women's office.
The number of questions about the
Comprehensove Examination for can
didates for Graduation Honors, which
have come to the attention of Dean
Mory Yost eince the notice was pub
lished .makes it advisable in her
opinion to state again the conditions
under which Graduation Honors are
given:
(a) The degree will be granted
"with distinction" to about one-tenth
of the graduating class. A minimum
grade point average of 2.00 will be re
quired.
(b) The degree will be granted
"with great distinction" to about one
twentieth of the graduating class. A
minimum grade point average of 2.40
will be required.
(d) The grade point average will be
reckoned on the work of the five quar
ters preceding the quarter of gradua
tion. Residence at Stanford for three
quarters is required. Work elsewhere
will be evaluated to conform to Stan
ford standards.
(e) During the five quarters men
tioned in (d), the student must have
completed forty units of work listed
as advanced undergraduate or gradu
ate work.
(112) Degrees "with distinction" and
"with great distinction" are to be dis
tributed among the five groups of de
partments approximately according to
registration.
(g) Recommendations from depart
ments will be requested and used as
in the case of Stanford Scholars.
(h) Each department will be re
quested to offer in the eighth week
of each quarter a comprehensive ex
amination on the undergraduate work
of the department if there are appli
cants for such an examination. Any
record made in this way will be con
sidered by the Committee in making
recommendations for degrees "with
distinction" or "with great distinc
tion."
Thus it will be seen, announces Dean
Yost, that the regulations, first, do
not require a Comprehensive Exami
nation in the major subject; second,
that if this examination is taken, the
result of it, whatever it is, will be
considered as part of the evidence
which the Committee will consider in
choosing the Honor Students.
Those students who wish to take
these Comprehensive Examinations
are requested to leave their names in
