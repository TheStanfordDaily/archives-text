"J'en ai Marre"
Isn't half so desperate as it sounds, for it's only
the 7iame of a song—and a perfume.
The song is sung by Mademoiselle "finguett, the
darling of the Casino de Paris. J'he perfume is
her very own, presented tcf San Francisco for,
the first time by Livingston's.
"J'en ai Marre" comes in a black-and-gold box
symbolic of a suicidal railroad bridge, and in its
ineluctable fragrance there lingers something of
the personality of this bewitching Parisian.
