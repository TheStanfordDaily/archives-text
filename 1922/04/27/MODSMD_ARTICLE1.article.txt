# KIRKSEY WILL RUN IN P.A.A. MEET AT BERKELEY APRIL 29
## Five Babe Athletes Included In List of Sixteen Entries; Sudden Takes Out 'Leave' 
### 
While sporting writers have been
handing him verbal bouquets in one
paragraph and crowning a new spirit
champion in the next, Morris Kirksey,
the veteran Cardinal speed burner, has
been quietly preparing to romp away
with the dashes in the P. A. A. meet at
Berkeley Saturday.
Kirksey isn't passe yet, as many of
the cinder-path followers believe. The
bad weather the first of this month
hindered his training, and he had not
rounded into form in the Big Meet last
Saturday. With two weeks of warm
weather, the Cardinal sprinter declares,
he will be as good as ever.
In the P. A. A. competition, in which
teams from California, Olympic Club,
Italia Virtus, and San Jose Y. M. C.
A. have been entered, Kirksey's principal
competitor will be his old rival, Hutch
ison, the Blue and Gold captain. Pro
vided his leg is fairly strong, and can
stand the gaff, the Stanford flash should
beat the field to the tape in both the
dashes.
Sixteen men have been entered in the
meet by Coach Templeton. The varsity
entries are: Kirksey, dashes; Black,
pole vault; Minsky, broad jump, hop,
skip, and jump; Ludeke, hop, skip, and
jump, 56-pound weight; Hartranft, shot
and discus; Hayes, hurdles; Wright,
220 and 440; Williamson, 220 and 440;
Coverly, 440; Falk, hurdles; Arthur,
shot, discus, and 56-pound weight
Smith, the freshman distance crack,
wants to trot around the track with
Charley Dorr, the Blue and Gold star,
before the latter graduates. Dorr will
probably enter the mile, as there is no
two-mile event, and Smith is also sched
uled for the four-lap grind
Other freshmen who will enter are
Leistner, hurdles; Tennant, dashes;
Murphy, mile; Harrell, broad jump.
The freshmen and varsity points will be
counted separately.
Eddie Sudden, who won both the
sprints last Saturday, has taken out a
leave of absence, and will go south to
train with Paddock at Pasadena. Sud
den's leave of absence will in no way
affect his eligibility for the I. C. A. A.
A. A. meet at Cambridge on May 27
and 28.
If Kirksey makes the grade in the
P. A. A. meet, he will probably go East
with the Stanford delegation, and the
Cardinal chances of winning the cham
pionship, with all of the men eligible,
will be considerably heightened.
