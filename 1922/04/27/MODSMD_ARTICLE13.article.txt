# Oxygen Pumps and Gas Masks Bought for Fire-Fighters
## 
### 
The live-ton ammonia tank in the
basement of the new Union developed
a leak yesterday afternoon, and gas
masks from Palo Alto had to be rushed
to the campus for the emergency.
Comptroller Roth ordered several gas
masks, together with a life-saving de
vice, which will in the future take care
of such emergencies.
As a result of the fire-prevention cam
paign conducted, improvements are al
ready being made in the Stanford de
partment. Six canvas covers for pro
tecting furniture from water during
tires have been purchased. The enlarge
ment of the engine .house to contain
three tire trucks a Cadillac, a Ford, and
the Seagrave motor, will begin soon.
The Ford has already been overhauled,
remodeled, and repainted, and has been
equipped with chemicals to fight grass
fires', which form the greatest single
cause of loss by lire in this vicinity.
The Cadillac will carry eighty gallons
of chemicals and six men, and will also
be used in lighting grass tires, when the
overhauling is completed.
