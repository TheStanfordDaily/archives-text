# Special Arrangements Being Made For Novel Program Dance in May
## 
### 
According to all plans of the commit
tee in charge of the Sophomore Dance
iii the Pavilion, it will be one of the
best dances yet held there. A ten
piece orchestra has been secured for the
evening; special programs with a spe
cial design will be exchanged for tick
ets at the beginning of the dance.
Because of the difficulty of hearing the
music at former dances, special arrange
ments will be made in placing the or
chestra. If it is possible to have the
new sounding board in place in time, it
will be used at this dance.
The proceeds of the dance will be used
towards paying the class debt. Tickets
may be obtained at the bookstore or
from various members of the class.
The dance will be a 12 o'clock informal.
