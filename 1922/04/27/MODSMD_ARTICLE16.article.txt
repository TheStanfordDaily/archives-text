# VANITY FAIR BALL WILL BE SCENE OF REVELRY TOMORROW
## 
### 
What! You never heard of it ?
Neither did we. But it was up in
Sallys' garret that they held the mirth
ful revels which have made the village
famous.
Sally was the queen of Greenwich
Village at its height. "In Sally
Garret," staged at Vanity Fair by
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Alpha
Delta Phi, will reproduce in exact de
tail the artist's studio, the careless mas
terpieces scattered about, the futuristic
atmosphere, and—ah-h ! —the „ Cubist
Chorus. Ten glorious girls in flashing
raiment will dance into the radiance of
six spotlights. Intricate steps, lilting
melodies—the very latest —and the
Greenwich Village Frolic (two scenes)
have been arranged by Les Seib, coach
ing the production. The theme —Vanity
at her fairest.
Cartoonist or photographer— to which
would you rather trust yourself? In
other words, how vain are you? If you
are, you may prefer the cartoonists. A
flattering likeness in three minutes, is
the motto over Cartoonists' Cave, with
Fred Fisher and Ted Van Deusen of
ficiating as cavemen. Freeman of Palo
Alto believes in the frank infallibility of
the camera, and offers to let you see
yourself as others see you inside of ten
minutes after exposure. The contest
is Truth vs. Beauty; may the best man
hold the ring.
