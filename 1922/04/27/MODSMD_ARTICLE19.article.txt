# U.C. PROFESSOR WILL ADDRESS CERCLE ON PROBLEMS OF FRANCE
## 
### 
"La France et Les Difficultcs Artuel
lcs" will be the subject of an address
by Professor Regis Michaud, of the
Romanic Languages department of the
University of California, at the meet
ing of the Cercle Francais in the Wo
men's Clubhouse, this evening at 8. The
speaker will discuss some of the fore
most problems in the affairs of France
today.
Miss F. Badger of San Francisco will
give several vocal selections for the mu
sical part of the program.
Miss Jessie Smith, '16, president of
the club, urges all members to be pres
ent, as plans for the benefit production
of French plays to be given May 10
will be discussed.

Two nights of dancing—the Vanity
Fair Fidget on Friday, and "Frivolity
Fete," combining free entertainment and
terpsichore, on Saturday—will mark the
festivities of the 1922 Carnival, which
throws open a mysterious realm tomor
row night. Three hours, from 10 to 1
o'clock, will be devoted to the dance to
be held in the pavilion tomorrow even
ing. On Saturday, the pavilion will be
surrendered to merry-makers from 10
to 12.
"The Parade of Pride," Ram's Head
Vanity Fair Ballet, will come on the
scene as the chief attraction in Frivolity
Fete. A forty-five-minute production,
with four specialty and ensemble num
bers, four different costumes ranging
from ballet skirt to evening gown, and
four absolutely unheard-of songs, are
promised by the directors, who have
seen tit to add to the lavishness of the
presentation since rehearsals . started
last Friday.
A sounding board, extending the
length of the pavilion stage and up to
the balcony, will be erected to throw
the music to all parts of the pavilion.
An eight-piece double-piano orchestra,
under the direction of Grinstead and
Hackett, has been secured to play both
nights, and indirect lighting arrange
ments are to be in the hands of Carroll
Hudson, '22.
Every college production has some
thing to laugh at. That is the opinion
of Arnold Bayley, '23, loyally supported
by Alpha Sigma Phi. Bayley, whose
reputation as an organist threatens to
surpass that of Warren D. Allen, an
nounces "The Burly Burlesque," a sali
ent review of the sharper points in cam
pus productions from "Pierre of the
Plains" up and down, as a twelve-act
extravaganza with sacred concerts in
between, while Alpha Sigma Phi an
nounces that a reinforced supporting
cast will hold up all details.
"Getting Gertie's Garter" is child's
play, declares Theta Chi, and forthwith
offers Something really intriguing by
comparison. "Sunbonnet Sue" (though
what good a sunbonnet does her is a
mystery) is the title of the fair damsel
who will sit in a place of eminence in
the Carnival tomorrow night. You get
three shots for a dime, and if you hit
the target the young lady obligingly falls
into a tub of brine to the rear. If you
do it twice in five—here's the catch—
you get a handsome and useful garter,
to be worn in the lapel, etc.
By 3 o'clock this afternoon, the out
line and proportions of the structures
in Vanity Fair were beginning to take
shape. Freshman work continued until
5:30. All organizations are doing their
own decoration and construction work
inside concessions, and will be required
to furnish their own shows. Stages will
be open for dress rehearsal tomorrow
afternoon, when all work on individual
concessions must be finished in order
to allow the Vanity Fair art director
and electricians to put the finishing
touches on the festive enclosure.
