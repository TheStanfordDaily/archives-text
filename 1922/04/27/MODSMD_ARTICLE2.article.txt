# EUPHRONIA DEFEATED IN TITULAR DEBATE
## 
### 
By a two to one decision of the
judges, Euphronia Debating Society
lost the deciding contest of the Inter
society Debating League to the Senate
Society of the University of California,
at Berkeley, last evening.
Euphronia debated the affirmative of
the question, "Resolved, That the United
States should recognize the defacto gov
ernment of Mexico." The negative
team based their arguments on the as
sumption that Article 27 of the Mexican
constitution threatened the interests of
American capital in Mexico, because it
would have a retroactive effect. Ar
ticle 27 provides for the nationalization
of Mexican oil lands and prevents
Americans from owning property ac
quired after the adoption of the new
constitution.
Euphronia, in refuting the arguments
of the negative, demonstrated that the
Obregon revolution was justified and
that its accomplishments have merited
recognition. It was further pointed out
that American interests, in Mexico will
be little affected by American recogni
tion.
Edward Landels, '22, Mathew To
briner, '24. and William Bielefeldt, '25,
represented Euphronia in the debate.
The Senate debaters were S. G. Bender,
L. Schere, and L. M. Twedt. Paul
Scharrenberg and George Samuel of
San Francisco, and Wells Orury of
Oakland acted as judges of the debate.
