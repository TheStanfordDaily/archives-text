# MORE OF THEM

Is it significant that the two Stanford teams which
came all the way through this year were led by
Stanford coaches? Floyd Kallatn's freshman base
ball outfit made the best showing of any in history,
and Dink Templeton's squad of tracksters provided
the greatest collective dope upset on the books of
track athletics.
A man who knows Stanford, with athletic ability
equal to that of a newcomer, will have a five years'
start on the latter when it comes to handling Stan
ford teams. While we have no complaints to make
of the spirit shown in other sports this year, that of
the track and freshmen baseball squads was emphati
cally the most tenacious. Every fielder of the 1925
tribe had the cocky attitude of a regular Ty. Cobb,
and each man stepped up to the plate with the full
confidence of Babe Ruth or Hornsby.
Templeton's squad had more than confidence. They
had determination, "guts," and stubbornness in the
extreme, and no one of them, star or outside chance
contender, would recognize a superior in any Bruin
contender of world fame or otherwise.
Stanford men seem to know just a little better how
to develop and take advantage of the true Stanford
spirit, and to make this intangible force a real factor
in counting results.
These well-known and experienced coaches who
have been appointed for next year have our unquali
fied approval. We have been hoping for their type of
men for a long time. But when the remaining vacan
cies are to be filled, and when subordinates are to be
added to the staffs already named, we suggest for
consideration of appointing officials the records of
the two Stanford coaches in charge this year.
Quite a few graduate athletes of the keener stra
tegic variety would be available to Stanford. With
men of the type of Templeton in charge of basket
ball or baseball, with athletes of Kallam's stamp
working with the freshmen or serving under our
famous instructors in football, the Stanford coach
ing staff would indeed be well rounded out, and the
future of the coaching situation insured. L. E.
