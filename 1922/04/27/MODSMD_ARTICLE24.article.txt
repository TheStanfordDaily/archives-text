# IT MEANS QUITE A BIT TO US ALL

The simple statement of Skull and Snakes this
evening should he easily understood. A student Car
nival may he a gala occasion which all may enjoy, a
co-operative student enterprise which brings together
all parts and groups of the campus in a month of
planning and working together, as well as in patron
age of the gala affair on the night of presentation.
The Carnival has the further advantage of provid
ing a certain sum of money for athletics and student
body coffers. Neither purpose will be effected if the
Carnival of this season presents some of the aspects
of that of 1921. An exact repetition of that affair
would leave the Student Council honor bound to ban
any production of future Carnivals. University au
thorities would be forced to step in if the Student
Council did not, and this would mean practically the
fall of student government.
It is no idea of the Daily Palo Alto to paint
a black picture, but merely to suggest that students
who would in any measure lend to the appearance of
the wrong sort of thing Friday and Saturday are not
only putting the student government to a strenuous
test; they are preventing the rest of he campus
from the rightful enjoyment of an occasion that

belongs to all; they are hurting athletics; and they
most surely prevent the possibility of future engage
ment in an activity that can be highly beneficial to all
of us. Is there any reason why each man of the
student body should not take the attitude of Skull
and Snakes' members as indicated in the statement
today?
