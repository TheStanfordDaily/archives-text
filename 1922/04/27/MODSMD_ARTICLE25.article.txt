# IS IT SPRING FEVER?
## 
### 
Each year about this time we hear the cry, "We'll
never get the stages up in time for the Carnival."
In the end it has always come out all right, though,
and things have been in pretty fair shape at the open
ing of the shows. Today, no different than any
other Carnival time, there remains a large part of
the work to be done the last day. The performers
are working on their skits for tomorrow night. To
morrow afternoon they will have to have rehearsals
all afternoon, so that they can't do anything on the
construction. Go down in the morning if you are
one of those lucky persons who have no Friday classes
and help get the stagings set so that the performances
in the afternoon can be run off in time to give the
actors a little rest before the evening shows.
