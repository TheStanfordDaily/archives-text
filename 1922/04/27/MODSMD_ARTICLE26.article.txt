# LOOK AND THEN ASK
## 
### 
While we are always ready to print items of gen
eral interest that are submitted under the viewpoint
of some student, we believe that it is not necessary
to break forth into print when the thing sought for
is something that can be readily found by application
to some known office of the University. Such infor
mation places are for the convenience of the student,
and there he can find out all that he wants to know
on the subject that he is interested in.
Viewpoints submitted to the Daily, while in good
faith, often place the organization inquired about in
an unfortunate situation. The reading public is quick
to seize upon anything that looks as if there might
be some scandal or mismanagement in a department
and not nearly so alert to see the justifications that
later come out.
Wherever there exists some condition that is of
interest to our community as a whole we welcome it
in our columns. But in case it is something that
perhaps had better be investigated first by the indi
vidual as to the facts it is a better plan not to come
out at first in the paper and invite a discussion where
there is none needed.
