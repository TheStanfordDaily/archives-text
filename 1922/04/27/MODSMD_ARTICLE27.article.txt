Yessir, boys, the Carnival is tomorrow night. Visitors
are warned that the lions are cross and that small boys
with hatpins concealed about their persons will be sum
marily dealt with. Bring your peanuts—the elephants
are hungry. The public is warned that anyone feeding
Jumbo a loaded peanut does so at his own risk, and that
the management positively will not clean up the re
mains.
* 9 e
To proceed. On our right, ladies and gentlemen, we
have the remarkable Tehootenary of Central Africa.
This unusual animal, positively the only of its kind on
the campus, is equipped with beautiful blue eyes and
four legs. The starboard legs are three inches longer
than those on the port side, thus fitting the beast most
admirably for its customary counter-clockwise progres
sion about the hills of its native land. For centuries,
ladies and gentlemen, the animal was hunted without
a single one being captured. It finally remained for the
ingenious American to trap the Tehootenary. This was
accomplished by walking around the hills in a clock
wise direction, meeting the surprised Tehootenary face
to face. In an effort of escape it turned around, and
losing its balance, rolled downhill into the waiting arms
of a second scientist, who was severely bitten.

I once knew a man from Poughkeepsie,
Who was firmly devoted to whiskey.
When invited to talk
He only would balk,
And reply, "My dear, I'm too tipsy."

"My dear sir, this is no aquarium. You have the

Announcement in the Daily Palo Alto of Wednesday: —
All Roble girls are advised to dine at Roble
tonight, because of the English Department din
ner, as ice cream will be served tonight instead
of tomorrow night.
Cabbages welcomes this further evidence of the
growing spirit of co-operation between faculty and stu
dents. In the near future it is quite possible that we
will see announcements like this:
The Mechanical Engineering Department wishes
to advise that hash will be served at the Union
tonight.
The Chemistry Department is credibly informed
that Larkin's is ottering a choice brand of corn
ed beef and cabbage tonight.
The Geology and Mining Department regrets to
advise that the pumpkin pie now on sale at the
Union is very stale.

Yessir, boys, the Carnival is tomorrow night. Visitors
are warned that the lions are cross and that small boys
with hatpins concealed about their persons will be sum
marily dealt with. Bring your peanuts—the elephants
are hungry. The public is warned that anyone feeding
Jumbo a loaded peanut does so at his own risk, and that
the management positively will not clean up the re
mains.

To proceed. On our right, ladies and gentlemen, we
have the remarkable Tehootenary of Central Africa.
This unusual animal, positively the only of its kind on
the campus, is equipped with beautiful blue eyes and
four legs. The starboard legs are three inches longer
than those on the port side, thus fitting the beast most
admirably for its customary counter-clockwise progres
sion about the hills of its native land. For centuries,
ladies and gentlemen, the animal was hunted without
a single one being captured. It finally remained for the
ingenious American to trap the Tehootenary. This was
accomplished by walking around the hills in a clock
wise direction, meeting the surprised Tehootenary face
to face. In an effort of escape it turned around, and
losing its balance, rolled downhill into the waiting arms
of a second scientist, who was severely bitten.

Who was firmly devoted to whiskey.

He only would balk,
And reply, "My dear, I'm too tipsy."

Announcement in the Daily Palo Alto of Wednesday: —
All Roble girls are advised to dine at Roble
tonight, because of the English Department din
ner, as ice cream will be served tonight instead
of tomorrow night.
Cabbages welcomes this further evidence of the
growing spirit of co-operation between faculty and stu
dents. In the near future it is quite possible that we
will see announcements like this:
The Mechanical Engineering Department wishes
to advise that hash will be served at the Union
tonight.
The Chemistry Department is credibly informed
that Larkin's is ottering a choice brand of corn
ed beef and cabbage tonight.
The Geology and Mining Department regrets to
advise that the pumpkin pie now on sale at the
Union is very stale.

Yessir, the game was a knockout. First somebody
knocked out a fly and then the pitcher was knocked
out of the box, and finally, a bat broke and knocked out
the bat-boy.
