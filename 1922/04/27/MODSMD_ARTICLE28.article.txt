# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
IN WASHINGTON
Congressman Johnson created a stir
in Washington with the charge that
hundreds of millions worth of dupli
cate Liberty Bonds were in circulation
as a result of inefficiency or corruption
in the Bureau of Engraving anil Print
ing. This charge voices a persistent
rumor that has been circulating ever
since the recent drastic executive
order discharging employees of the
Bureau. A Congressional investiga
tion may be ordered.
IN THE FAR EAST
The War Lords Chang Tsao Lin and
Wu Fei Fu have opened their cam
paign against Peking. The President
of China has issued an appeal, declar
ing, that his nation is on the verge of
civil war. As a matter ol fact it has
been torn by civil war for the last ten
years. Corruption is now vorse tun
in, the da/* of Manchus, and merchants
speak of the Manchu days as the
"good old days." It is possible that
Dr. Sun Yat Sen, head of the only
government in China that stands for
anything more than the personal am
bition of some leader, may also lead
an expedition against Peking.
AT GENOA
Lloyd George drew an alarming pic
ture of conditions in Europe in an
interview with American and British
journalists. He pointed out that Rus
sia and Germany together contain two
thirds of the population of Europe, and
it would be folly to try to ignore their
importance. As proof of the danger
of trouble, he cited the fact that there
is no frontier from the Baltic to the
Black Sea, from Lithuania and Poland
to Rumania, that had been accepted.
He is said to be preparing the way for
a "peace-pact," by which each power
would undertake not to invade the
lands of any other for a term of years.
Such a pact would give stability to the
uncertain eastern frontiers, and it
would also have a result of tremendous
importance to France. It would tie
her hands and make it impossible for
her to force Germany to come to terms
by invading her soil.
