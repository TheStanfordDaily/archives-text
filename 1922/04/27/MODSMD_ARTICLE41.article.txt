SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY,
April 27. (P. I. N. S.) â€”To say that a
college student is a good athlete and a
good actor at one and the same time
may sound like "4 case of "dual person
ality," but the "Mission Play of Santa
Clara," which opens here Tuesday, has
proven such a thing is not only possible,
but actually true. Of the sixteen major
parts in the famed drama seven arc
taken by men who have made recent
sports history at the Mission school.
The leading part of "Padre Jose Ma
ria Del Real" is taken by Mike Dunne,
varsity pitcher on the 1922 nine. Mike's
dramatic activities kept him off the dia
mond considerably, but he managed to
win his block at Stanford's expense.
Other leading actors and athletes are:
Alfred A. ("Fat") Ferrario, football
and basketball star; Caesar Mannelli, all
round athlete.; George Haneberg, base
ball captain; John Lewis, football tackle;
Tom Crowe, center on grid team; and
"Hoot" Miller, football player.
