# MAYOR OF BERKELEY TO SPEAK ON PUBLIC UTILITIES TONIGHT
## 
### 
Louis Bartlet and Arthur M. Cath
cart, mayors of Berkeley and Palo Alto,
will speak this evening, at 7:30 o'clock,
in Room 12 of the Law Building.
Bartlet, who is president of the
League of California Municipalities, will
speak on the subject, "How California
Can Be Made as Efficient as Palo Alto
in Its Public Utilities." The competent
management of Palo Alto's public util
ities has attracted the attention of state
and municipal public service organiza
tions, and many cities in California are
considering the adoption of a plan sim
ilar to that in use in Palo Alto. Bart
let, in his lecture, will show how an
improvement of this kind can be ef
fectively brought about.
Largely because of Mayor Bartlet's
efforts, the 1922 convention of the
League of California Municipalities will
be held at Stanford some time next Sep
tember. He is a member of the State
Water and Power Act Campaign Com
mittee, and when not acting in his of
ficial capacity, as mayor of Berkeley, he
practices law in San Francisco.
Professor Cathcart will preside at
the meeting, which is under the auspices
of Euphronia Debating Society. The
public is invited to attend.
