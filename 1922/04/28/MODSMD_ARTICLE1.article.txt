# SIXTEEN MEN WILL WEAR CARDINAL IN ANNUAL P.A.A. MEET
## Event at Berkeley Tomorrow Will Bring to Close Local Cinder-Path Competition 
### 
Sixteen entries will represent the Car
dinal at Berkeley tomorrow afternoon in
the Pacific Athletic Association meet,
which will draw the curtain on inter
collegiate track competition for the year
in this part of the country.
Neither Templeton nor Christie is
making any effort to enter a full-strength
team. The Stanford coach is sending
eleven varsity men and five freshman
tracksters, while Christie is withholding
Muller, Hendrixson and Hutchison. The
points for both the Stanford and Cali
fornia freshmen will be counted sepa
rately from those of their respective
varsities.
By far the greatest interest here cen
ters on what sport writers are pleased
to call the "comeback" of Morris Kirk
sey. If the Cardinal veteran tries to run
tomorrow, the results will determine
whether he will need to make a "come
back" or not, for lie has only appeared in
competition once this year, and that is
no fair criterion of whether he is
"through."
Other Cardinal entries tomorrow are
Falk and Hayes in the hurdles; Hart
ranft, Ludeke, and Arthur in the
weights; Black in the pole vault, Wright
and Williamson in the quarter, Macin
tosh in the half, Minsky in the broad
jump and hop, skip and jump, and pos
sibly Hanner in the javelin.
A high-class field of 440-men will toe
the marks in the one-lap event. Mc-
Donald of the Bears will be after Wil
liamson for revenge, since the former
failed to place last Saturday. Storie,
former San Jose High quarter-miler,
who ran the distance in 51 flat, will also
compete.
Several of the "old-timers" will get
into the harness again tomorrow. Waltz,
former California miler, will wear the
colors of the San Jose Y. M. C. A.
Lanky "Red" Drew, who ran the hurdles
for the Bruins last year, is entered in
the 220 lows. Krogness, former Har
vard star, will run in both the barrier
events.
Of the five Cardinal freshmen. Smith
and Leistner appear to have the best
chance of winning points. Leistner ran
the 120 highs in 15 3-5 seconds against
Becker of the Bear cubs, and that time
is good enough to guarantee him a place
in any hurdle race in this vicinity. Smith
has never run up against any real com
petition, and should do close to 4 :30 in
the mile if pressed.
