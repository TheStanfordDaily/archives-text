# REVELRY 10 RULE AT OPENING OF GRAND PROMENADE IN VANITY FAIR
## JUNIOR OPERA WILL NOT BE ELABORATE Complicated Plot Has Simple Setting; Music and Story Will Have Co-ordination 
### 
This year's Junior Opera, to be pre
sented May 13, will not be spectacular.
Simplicity and coherence are the ele
ments which the authors, Rosemary
Drachman, '22, and Tom Kleckner, '18,
and Coach Lester Seib, '22, are striving
to secure.
There are complications in the plot—
for it would not be a Junior Opera with
out complications—but they are all in
geniously untangled before the final cur
tain. Bill, the rescuing lover, spends
most of his time during the first act in
pulling people out of predicaments and
has little time to spare for his sweet
heart. Tired of suffering because of the
plights of others, Lyle, the sweetheart,
resolves to tackle the rescuing game her
self. Being an amateur, she almost
hopelessly tangles things hp, and in the
end has to be freed herself. On her
crusade, Lyle sells her father's studio to
the wrong party—a man who made the
purchase because of his love for one of
the dancers. The only way to get back
the studio is to make him fall out of
love—and attempts to do this occupy the
entire second act.
The opera will not be of the revue type.
The songs all work logically into the
plot and the ballet setting allows oppor
tunity for bringing in several dancing
numbers.
Another element dicerent from former
third-year productions will be the fea
turing of the best musical numbers sev
eral times throughout the show. Fewer
songs with greater emphasis upon their
perfection is the idea with which the
musical end is being worked out under
the direction of C. W. Midgeley, '23.
"There is nothing weird, exotic, ka
leidoscopic or sensational about this
year's opera," said the authors this morn
ing. "Beauty and comedy of the sim
plest sort is what we have tried to pro
vide as a sort of relief from the mad
race for new technical thrills."
