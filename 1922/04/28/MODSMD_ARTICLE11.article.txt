## 
### 
"A Stanford tradition is at stake,
and whether the baseball fight will be
retained at Stanford, depends on the
action of sophomores and freshmen
within the next twenty-two hours."
This is the final statement issued by
"Red" Tauzer ,'2O, president of Skull
and Snakes, preliminary to the big
brawl which commences next Monday
afternoon.
The baseball game between the rival
underclassmen is called for 4 o'clock
on the varsity diamond. Sometime
during the progress of the game, Cap
tain Geroge Green will toss a specially
marked ball out on the field. The fight
will last for one hour and must at all
times be kept within the fence sur
rounding the field. At the end of the
specified time, a pistol will be fired
and all hostilities will cease. The
class which returns the ball will be
declared the winner. If neither side is
successful in returning it, the fight
will be called a tie.
"Red" Tauzer has called a special
meeting of all "S" men for 3:45 Mon
day afternoon in front of the Union,
to make final arrangements for the
refereeing of the fight.
