# THE 						NIGHT IS YOUNG
## 
### 
This is our evening to revel within the maze of
concessions modelel along the lines of the things
that we see advertised in the Vanity Fair stories.
We have unique acts based on the characterizations
of the Vogue artists and beauty ballets modeled on
nothing more than the characterizations of the wealth
of home talent. Every sort of fun-making awaits
our entrance. The spirit of the night is joy. Let's
have it entire without any of the less enjoyable fea
tures that mark so many public performances since
it waxes collegiate to get paralyzed before an evening
can be enjoyed.
