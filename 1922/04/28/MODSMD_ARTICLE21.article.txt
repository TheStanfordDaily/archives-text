# TIME TO CRY ENOUGH
## 
### 
When we see that police officers are among the
bands of armed men who are acting in the name
of justice to rectify the wrongs that are claimed to
be undermining our country, we wonder where we
are finally to get off. The police officer is the man
upon whom we rest for a last resort in case of need
in time of disorder. Now we see that he may be
directly in league with the masked groups which are
terrorizing our communities. Is it that we can not
call upon the law now to protect us in time when
our homes are jeopardized?
There is no argument about the fact that many of
the things that are done under the guise of the In
visible Empire are things which the law should see to.
Rut still we cry that there is no license that gives a
man or group leave to go out and exercise justice
simply because there is the ability. The very idea
takes us back to the stone age when each man was
his justice. When he was wronged he wielded a
hammer for a little while and his wrongdoer was
Itors dc combat for keeps. It isn't a very big jump
to taking men out of their homes in the middle of
the night and scaring their women folks to the point
of prostration. While we don't defend the culprits
in the latest Los Angeles outbreak, and while we
think that the charges against the Ku Klux are likely
exaggerated, still we can not help thinking that such
an usurpation of power by an unauthorized hand is
breaking down our system of justice and endangering
all our rights and principles.
