# IS THIS FLATTERY?

A couple of college men were standing on a down
town corner after the Big Meet. Two other college
men came down the street, one of the latter a man
whom the first two had not seen for two years. The
greeting was cordial and felicitations were passed on
the outcome of the meet.
A policeman stepped up to the four men and said,

Move on around the corner with that stuff: keep
out of sight." Now this was at 7 o'clock in the
evening and the men were going home. The cop
took it that they were drunk, at least that they had
been drinking. They had not. We wonder if the
idea has gotten so far about drinking that the police
men believe every happy young man on the street to
be liquored. If this is so we are placed in a truly
unenviable situation from which we must strive to
free ourselves. To be taken for drunk may seem
flattery to us for a minute in this time of drought,
but we realize afterward that it is not well for us or
our home.
