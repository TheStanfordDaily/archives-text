A stagger on an icy walk,

Out of the city chickens and pointed prunes into a
snaky sea of lounging lizards and goofy gurgles, she
wearily wended her winding way undaunted, unafraid.
Many millions trailed in the wicked wake of the pretty
peach who silently started from the cracked city of
the humble hicks. From a giggling girl to a mushy
miss, this silvervoiced singer flouted feeble men. Gal
lant gentlemen and monocled inogs sighted singular in
cidents of her able ability on brilliant Broadway. Gib
bering guys and jesting jays silently singled out this
priceless princess for fickle flirtations and pleasing
pleasures. To these romatic rovers, the sassy singer
slopped slushy slang and sang silly songs of blissful
bunk. Painted pickles proudly protested, but their
jabbing jealousies and frivolous fizzes functionally fail
ed to emotionally effect the far-famed stage star. Flary
flatterers proudly proclaimed her fiery features. Many
bubble boulders asked for her handsome hand, but all
were ousted overboard in the dizzy dance of her so
called success. A full future lusciously loomed before
her highness, but she miraculously met a former friend
who had attained achievement. He had hailed from the
same hard-boiled hick town. Strange synthesis were
rapidly rushed, and today our loving little lady is hap
pily hampered by a henpecked husband with whom she
is working wonders.

Why not bring advertising to the class room?
Why not include the following in the Registration
Manual? "Integral Calculus, 2b; Take off that unsightly
honor-point surplus." "Citizenship 1; A quiet 10 o'clock;

course and grow thin —you'll never have time for lunch."

Out of the city chickens and pointed prunes into a

wearily wended her winding way undaunted, unafraid.
Many millions trailed in the wicked wake of the pretty
peach who silently started from the cracked city of
the humble hicks. From a giggling girl to a mushy
miss, this silvervoiced singer flouted feeble men. Gal
lant gentlemen and monocled inogs sighted singular in

bering guys and jesting jays silently singled out this
priceless princess for fickle flirtations and pleasing
pleasures. To these romatic rovers, the sassy singer
slopped slushy slang and sang silly songs of blissful
bunk. Painted pickles proudly protested, but their

were ousted overboard in the dizzy dance of her so

her highness, but she miraculously met a former friend
