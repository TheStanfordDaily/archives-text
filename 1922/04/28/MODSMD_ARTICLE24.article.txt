THE REPARATIONS QUESTION
The Genoa conference appears to
have reached a crisis over the repara
tions question. France insists that
Germany must fulfill to the letter her
financial obligations under the treaty
of Versailles. Premier Poincare plans
to bring the question before the sup
reme council, plus Poland and the little
entente. If this body refuses to take
the decisive steps that France de
mands, he has threatened to with
draw from the Genoa conference and
make a separate military demonstra
tion in the Ruhr. Lloyd George is
making frantic efforts to avoid taking
this course. He insists that all the
Versailles signatories be consulted,
hoping in* this way to strengthen the
British Block by the addition of Portu
gal and the British dominions. The
British delegation hopes untimately to
bring the general question of repara
tions before the conference itself. If
they succeed in reconciling France
to this course, Lloyd George will have
achieved one of the great diplomatic
victories of his career. Failure will
involve the break up of the Genoa con
ference and will greatly impair the
British premier's chance of success at
the next election.
HARDING SPEAKS ON GRANT
President Harding yesterday deliv
ered an address at the Point Pleasant
exercises commemorating the 100 th
anniversary of the birth of General
Grant. The President eulogized the
great military leader's magnanimity,
and remarked " the need of a similar
spirit of reconciliation in the world
today. "I cannot help but believe,"
he said, "that something of the spirit
with which Grant welcomed victory,
something of his eagerness to return
to helpful ways have speeded the re
storation and hastened the return to
prosperity and happiness without
which there can be no abiding peace."
He emphasized the triumph of the
principles for which Grant stood, and,
comfortably oblivious to the recent
history of occidental civilization, ex
claimed: "A score of new republics
have unfurled their flags and democ
racy has opened new avenues of liber
ty and made justice more secure. Ci
vilization meanwhile has made such
advances that there has seemed a di
vinity poining the way. The Presi
dent has seldom revealed more expli
citly his own benevolent outlook on
life..
ARMY AND NAVY APPROPRIA
TIONS
$t is reported that the Senate com
mittees will recommend army and
navy appropriations considerably
larger than those approved by the
House. Administration senators are
determined not to let armaments be
reduced to a size inadequate for na
tional defense. An effort will be made
to increase the personnel of the army
above 115,000 and provide for the con
struction of an aeroplane carrier at
a cost of $15,000,000.

reduced to a size inadequate for na
tional defense. An effort will be made
to increase the personnel of the army
above 115,000 and provide for the con
struction of an aeroplane carrier at
a cost of $15,000,000.
THE REPARATIONS QUESTION
The Genoa conference appears to
have reached a crisis over the repara
tions question. France insists that
Germany must fulfill to the letter her
financial obligations under the treaty
of Versailles. Premier Poincare plans
to bring the question before the sup
reme council, plus Poland and the little
entente. If this body refuses to take
the decisive steps that France de
mands, he has threatened to with
draw from the Genoa conference and
make a separate military demonstra
tion in the Ruhr. Lloyd George is
making frantic efforts to avoid taking
this course. He insists that all the
Versailles signatories be consulted,
hoping in* this way to strengthen the
British Block by the addition of Portu
gal and the British dominions. The
British delegation hopes untimately to
bring the general question of repara
tions before the conference itself. If
they succeed in reconciling France
to this course, Lloyd George will have
achieved one of the great diplomatic
victories of his career. Failure will
involve the break up of the Genoa con
ference and will greatly impair the
British premier's chance of success at
the next election.
HARDING SPEAKS ON GRANT
President Harding yesterday deliv
ered an address at the Point Pleasant
exercises commemorating the 100 th
anniversary of the birth of General
Grant. The President eulogized the
great military leader's magnanimity,
and remarked " the need of a similar
spirit of reconciliation in the world
today. "I cannot help but believe,"
he said, "that something of the spirit
with which Grant welcomed victory,
something of his eagerness to return
to helpful ways have speeded the re
storation and hastened the return to
prosperity and happiness without
which there can be no abiding peace."
He emphasized the triumph of the
principles for which Grant stood, and,
comfortably oblivious to the recent
history of occidental civilization, ex
claimed: "A score of new republics
have unfurled their flags and democ
racy has opened new avenues of liber
ty and made justice more secure. Ci
vilization meanwhile has made such
advances that there has seemed a di
vinity poining the way. The Presi
dent has seldom revealed more expli
citly his own benevolent outlook on
life..
ARMY AND NAVY APPROPRIA
TIONS
$t is reported that the Senate com
mittees will recommend army and
navy appropriations considerably
larger than those approved by the
House. Administration senators are
determined not to let armaments be
reduced to a size inadequate for na
tional defense. An effort will be made
to increase the personnel of the army
above 115,000 and provide for the con
struction of an aeroplane carrier at
a cost of $15,000,000.
