# ANNUAL P.A.L. MEET HELD HERE TOMORROW
## 
### 
The Peninsula Athletic League track
meet for the 1922 season is to be run off
on the university oval next Saturday
afternoon at 2:30.
As usual, the big fight of the meet
will be between San Jose and Palo Alto
high schools. The teams of these two
institutions are practically evenly
matched, as shown by the results of the
North Coast Section meet where San
Jose scored 27 points and Palo Alto 22.
The Paly men, however, will have a
more evenly balanced squad, which will
offset San Jose's larger number of
track entries.
The other schools in the league have
not as large squads as Palo Alto and
San Jose. Other schools entering teams
are Mountain View, San Mateo, Red
wood City and Santa Clara.
