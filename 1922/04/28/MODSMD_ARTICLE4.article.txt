# Results of Battle For King and Queen Inserted As Daily Goes to Press
## 
### 
Amid shouts of rage and excitement
by four campaign managers, the con
test for King and Queen of the carni
val came to a close yesterday at 2:30.
A quiet student slipped in a last
check saying, "Credit this with the
rest." Then the election clerks dash
ed out of the mob into a waiting ma
chine, and headed for the Daily Palo
Alto office. There was ten minutes
left to get the results into the paper.
The linotyper idled while the votes
were told off. Then came the last box,
the clerks saw two candidates go far
into the lead, and the reporter dashed
into the back room with the story
"Muscio and Wassum Win!"
As the type was being set for the
evening edition, the officials rechecked
the votes, and the final count record
ed "Wassum 22,720, Waful 14,293;
Muscio 23,115, Richardson 15,790."
