# WOMEN TO REHEARSE PAGEANT TOMORROW
## Separate Parts of Masque to Be Put Together For First Time in All-Day Practice 
### 
All parts of the women's Spring
Pageant will rehearse tomorrow at the
stage which has been constructed on
the lake bank. Practices will start at 9
in the morning and at 1 in the afternoon.
The afternoon rehearsal will be dis

Merrymakers' Dance they present a story
of childish love-making. After the girls
