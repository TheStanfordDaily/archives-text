around a celebration in honor of the
godess Freya, who is the ancient Celtic
patro nof springtime, of the fertility of
the fields, and of agriculture. The
Britain villagers dance'and make merry
on this day of festival. In the Festival
Dance they represent in pantomime the
plowing of the fields, sowing the seed,
and finally cutting and threshing it.
They then begin one of the old Britain
folk-dances, such as were danced on
the village green. Those who will take

Mildred Burlingame, Helen Lunsford,
Alice Dodds, Dorothy Meyer, Mabel
Jones, Ruth Newlin, Doris Hall, Adele
Wellman, Sarah Meskitnons, Hazel
Churchman, Margaret Loper, Beatrice
Fenner and Katherine McCleave.
The boys and girls of the village romp
through this day of freedom. In the
Merrymakers' Dance they present a story
of childish love-making. After the girls
dance while the boys pipe for them on
shepherds' reeds, the maidens coquetish
ly quarrel with their swains, who go
off and tear their hair. They soon for
get their grienvances and dance mer
rily together again. The merrymakers
are Margaret Harroun, Frances Pleas
ants, Barbara Bledsoe, Anna Fitzhugh,
Eugenia Bentley, Dorothy Muller, Ruth
Langer, Dorothy Dahler, Veta Hopper,
