# WATER AND POWER ACT IS DISCUSSED BY MAYOR BARTLETT
## 
### 
"Competition between the state and
public service corporations will mean
cheaper and better service in public utili
ties," declared Louis Bartlctt, mayor of
Berkeley, in advocating the proposed
water and power act, here yesterday eve
ning.
Bartlett pointed out that the majority
of the municipal public utility enter
prises have been unqualified successes.
Los Angeles was cited as being a city
whose system of municipal power con
trol had resulted in a great increase in
efficiency and consequently a propor
tionate reduction in tax expenses.
"Palo Alto is one of the most efficient
communities in the country in all phases
of municipally operated public utilities,"
according to Mayor Bartlett. He stated
that the passing of the water and power
act would mean the adoption of a plan
by the state which would be as efficient
as that in use in Palo Alto, but on a
larger scale.
Bartlett justified the proposed act by
showing that it would mean a reduction
of taxes to the people of the state and
that it would not hinder the work of the
private power corporations but would
merely supplement their enterprises.
Following the lecture an open discus
sion was held. Herbert Alexander, '22,
presided at the meeting.
