# R.O.T.C. PROGRAM IS PLANNED FOR ALUMNI
## 
### 
The hundreds of Stanford alumni who
will return to the campus for University
Day, Saturday, May 20, will be given an
opportunity to see the Stanford field
artillery battalion of the R. O. T. C. on
dress parade and be the spectators of a
fast polo game between the teams of
the Stanford corps, in which Major Le
roy P. Collins, professor of military
training at Stanford, will participate.
The Stanford battalion will on that
day inaugurate the custom of holding a
President's Review, at which time Pres
ident Wilbur will present the graduates
of the unit with their commissions in
the reserve corps.
The Stanford unit has made a remark
able record. While in actual numbers
it holds only fourth place in the corps
area in percentage of commissions won
it outranks every other unit, more than
10 per cent of the total strength having
won commissions as second lieutenants.
Sixteen men will be commissioned as
second lieutenants of field artillery and
one as second lieutenant of infantry.
The Stanford R. O. T. C. men take
considerable pride in pointing out that
if the University of California unit with
its 1671 students, equaled the Stanford
record they would commission this year
about 170 second lieutenants instead of
the 25 they actually have. The review
and presentation of commissions by
President Wilbur will take place at 9:30
in the morning.
At 10:30 will come the polo game.
The Stanford polo players have de
veloped a first class team this year and
their game is also made much more
spectacula rby the fact that Major Col
lins has been able to secure good polo
ponies for them.
The game on University Day will be
in the nature of a hard practice before
the sn ies of three games with the R. O.
T. C. unit of the Oregon Agricultuarl
College, which will take place the week
of May 29 at Stanford. The northern
unit has accepted Stanford's challenge
and expects to send down a tea mthat
will give the Stanford men a hard con
test for the championship.
On Saturday, May 27, the Stanford
field artillery unit will hold its annual
military tournament which, attended by
high military officers and filled with con
tests between mounted men and teams,
is always a gala occasion.
