# WHITING WILLIAMS DESCRIBES MODERN WORKERS' PROBLEM
## Three Years' Experience As Laborer Forms Background of Former Executive's Talk 
### 
There is nothing fundamentally wrong
with the laborer of today, says Whiting
Williams, whose varied experiences with
his "overall" method formed the basis
of his talk on "What's On the Workers'
Minds?" at the Assembly Hall this
â€¢
morning.
Williams, who was vice-president of
the Hydraulic Steel Company in 1919,
put $25 in his overall's pocket, assumed
an alias, and for three years has been
working as a laborer in all parts of the
world and in all kinds of jobs. So ef
fective was his transformation from the
"white-collared" office man to the every
day workman, that not once was his
identity and purpose suspected.
What Williams found by analyzing
his companions during those three years,
was forcefully brought home to his au
dience. By far the most important
things on the minds of the workers of
today, he thinks, is the having and
holding of a job. That is the key to
the labor problem. Before one can hope
to understand the situation, or the point
of view of the laborer, he must have
an idea of the importance of a steady
job.
Next important in the mind of the
workman, is what Williams termed the
"spiritual factors." He found that,
from lowest rank among the unskilled
workers to the more advanced positions,
that the job and its nature determined
a man's self-respect. "A better job
makes a better man," was the way Wil
liams characterized the feeling of the
workman.
"The great demoralizing factors today
are the denial of the man's importance
and the intermittent, seasonal job. The
chief incentive should be hope for re
ward, rather than fear of joblessness.
Irregular work makes an irregular
worker, and the irregular worker be
comes an irregular citizen."
Another drawback, Williams believes,
exists in the physical condition of many
jobs. Men that are perennially tired,
he declared, can't make a good return
on the capital invested in them in the
form of wages. Heavy drinking was
attributed to the desire to forget the
conditions under which the niejn
worked every day.
There is room for improvement in
the attitude which some business organ
izations take toward their workers, said
Williams. The men invariably are bet
ter satisfied, and, moreover, do more
work, if they know the employer real
izes feelings of his men.
Captain J. D. Houser, '10, one of the
organizers of the newly formed Em
ployment Relations Association, in a
short, interesting talk, told of the work
which they hoped to accomplish in the
Bay district.
