# ENSEMBLE REHEARSAL OF PAGEANT DANCES IS CALLED FOR TUESDAY
## 
### 
A complete rehearsal of all the dance
numbers in the Women's Spring Pageant
with the University Orchestra will be
held at 4 o'clock tomorrow at the stage
constructed at the Lake.
Miss Edith Pasmore, who is directing
the dances, urges that every woman who
has a part in them be present, since this
is the first time that the orchestra has
practiced with the dancers.
Construction work on the out-of
of-doors. theater is progressing rapidly.
The stage was first ploughed up and
then rolled and turfed. Canvases are
stretched over the new turf during
practices, so that it will not be de
stroyed. The side of the hill back of
the stage where the audience will be
seated has been terraced and benches
for the spectators will be placed on
these terraces.
One of the features of the pageant
will be a series of Roman dances, in
which Octavia, a jealous Roman maiden,
sees that her lover is being taken away
from her by Randalin and calls her fol
lowers out to dance for him and in
this way to reveal the uncouthness of
the Britains, who arc Randalin's follow
ers. These dances are all classic in
type and will be models of technique
and skill. Among them are a trio, an
Urn Dance, and a Cymbal Dance.
Tickets for the pageant are on sale
this week at Crandall's in Palo Alto and

tained from 9 to 12 at the box office
