# ENCINA, EL TORO, AND DELTA CHI WIN INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
Work on the Spring Carnival was re
sponsible for two breaks in the intra
mural baseball program last week; Del
ta Kappa Epsilon forfeiting to Delta
Tau Delta, and Alpha Tau Omega post
poning their match with Kappa Sigma,
by mutual consent. Three games were
played off.
The best game of the year was that
between Encina No. Two and the Break
ers Club, which went to the former by
an 8 to 7 score. The game was closely
contested throughout, and full of action
and unusual plays. Smith, Taylor, and
Rowland did battery work for Encina
No. Two, with Eddleman and Davis for
the losers. Taylor, who was a member
of the Cornell varsity squad, pitched
well in the two innings in which he fig
ured, allowing no hits, but walking two
men.
Sequoia teams were unfortunate, Team
No. One losing to Delta Chi, 9 to 5.
Sequoia took the lead early in the game,
but was unable to hold it. The only
feature was a lapse in signals by Delta
Chi, when their first baseman attempted
a double play by throwing to his own
base, which was unoccupied. Coplen
and Gorman made up the Delta Chi
battery, with Prior and Smith working
for the losers.
El Toro took a fast game from Se
quoia No. Two, the score standing at 11
to 10. This was played on the varsity
diamond, and errors were consequently
reduced to a minimum. Connolly and
Wright were the winning battery men,
with Morrison and Londahl on duty for
Sequoia No. Two.
This afternoon, Beta Theta Pi played
Phi Kappa Sigma, Delta Upsilon met
Alpha Delta Phi, El Cuadro tangled with
Theta Chi, and Sigma Chi engaged El
Campo.
