# STANFORD TRACKMEN TAKE 52 POINTS IN BIG P.A.A. CINDER MEET
## California Winner With 72 Points; Cardinal Babes Beat Bruin Cubs; Hartranft Is High Point Man 
### 
Twelve trackmen of Coach "Dink" Templeton's clan scored fifty-two
points in the Pacific Association meet of the A. A. U., at Berkeley, Saturday.
The University of California, with twice as many entries, easily topped the
point-column with a total of seventy-one. With forty-eight and one-half points
the Olympic Club took third, while the Stanford freshmen entries beat the
Bruin first-year representatives, eight to six.
Of several enraged Bears reported to have been laying in wait for a
chance at one or two of Templeton's outfit who finished ahead of them in>
the Big Meet, "Red" Norris, California pole vaulter, was the only man to
actually try a come-back. This Blue and Gold "fire-top" set the bar at 12
feet 9 inches, and cleared it. The extra height meant nothing to Black, who
duplicated the performance, and the two quit at a tie. Both tried 13 feet 1
inch unsuccessfully.
Neither Hendrixson nor McDonald showed up for the quarter mile, and

Williamson ran against the Bear fresh
men, Geertz, Storie of San Jose, Sax
by of California, and his team-mate
Coverly. "Blink" drew an outside
lane, took a third place on the turn,
and raced with Geertz for the lead on
the back stretch, but could not quite
get the pole. He dropped back for the
second turn, and three men came into
the home stretch ahead of him. With,
an easy finish he passed the field and
was timed at 50 4-5 seconds. Coverly
ran a nice race, finishing fourth. Witi*
a little more strength this youngster
will not be the slowest of William
son's team-mates.
Ex-Captain Kirksey loafed through
the 220-yard dash in 22 4-5 seconds.
The veteran had a nice workout, and
apparently could have traveled much
faster had there been necessity.
Bear Mile Trio Defeated
The mile race offered a surprise.
The Bruin trio of Denton, Kitts and
Fiske, who have been breaking the
tape in the four-lap race for California,
and Knowlton, a fourth Bear, lined
up against the Stanford freshmen
entry, Smith. One by one they passed
Smith until he ran in fifth position,
fiftefen yards behind Denton, who led.
Smith stepped out at the second turn
of the last lap, apparently giving:
everything he had, until he led the
field twenty yards from the finish.
Denton, with a beautiful sprint, then
closed up on the freshman, who sensed
his presence, added a spurt, and broke
the tape by two yards.
Leistner, another freshman entry,
took a third in the low hurdles, and
Tennant a fourth in the century.
Ludeke, finding a couple of events
to his liking in the wide variety offer
ed, took second in the 56 pound
weight, and in the hop, step, and
jump.
A Bad Day For Captains
Captain Flint Hanner and Captain
elect Ftelk both showed a knock-ofl:
