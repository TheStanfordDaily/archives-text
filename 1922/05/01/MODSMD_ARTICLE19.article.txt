# THE 						FIGHT AT STAKE
## 
### 
I his afternoon the treshmen and the Sophomores
battled to a finish; at least we hope that all is
finished. On the outcome of this fight hangs the
decision whether there will be more in the future or
not. Like so many other g'ood old traditional scraps
and class celebrations, too many objectionable things
have crept into the underclass fight, and so it has
been cut down now to a place where it is nothing
more than art afternoon's workout and in the estima
tion of many ought to be done away with entirely.
Looking back a couple of years to the two nights
spent in rounding up freshmen before the fight, and
to the auto rides indulged in just before the fight
when we got left ten miles away without shoes, we
are inclined to think the fight of today to be a bit
tame. But such is not the case. There the fight
was only an incidental part of a two- or three-day
campaign by the opposing forces and the outcome
depended to a large degree on the success of the
strategy used by the commander of one force or the
other.
Today there is no need for the sleepless vigil
which interfered with the study of the student, and
at the same time there are the baseball game and the
fight which are the main points of the struggle. As
soon as the fight is over and the ball has been gotten
out there is only a short time to get it back to the
captain. This takes away the joy of an evening's
fight iti addition to the one of the afternoon. But as
the fight is being this year put on a completely dif
ferent basis than ever before we hope that it proves
the success that it must be to keep the yearly event
liere at all.
On how well the rules are lived up to depends
the existence. The whistle blown for the final end
ing may it really be, and no reprisals be made on
either side after dark to endanger the perpetuation
of the tradition.
