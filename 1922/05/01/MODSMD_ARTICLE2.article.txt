# MAY PLEDGING PLAN TO BE VOTED ON TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford fraternities will act tonight
on the "May Pledging System" whereby
new men are pledged in the eighth week
of the spring quarter. A letter from
the president of the Interfraternity Con
ference explaining the plan and its in
tended results has been sent to the head
of each house and will be read at the
chapter meetings this evening.
Last term it was unanimously agreed
by the fraternities that the system of
selecting freshmen which was used dur
ing the fall was unsatisfactory, being
too long to practice the unavoidable in
tensive type of rushing. The thirteen
day period adopted by the Conference
has also proven unsatisfactory. Realiz
ing the shortcomings of the present sys
tems, the Alumni Interfraternity Con
ference of San Francisco, after making
an investigation of conditions, has en
dorsed the principle of a year's rushing
period.
"The adoption of the plan of May
Pledging will be a potent factor in en
abling fraternities to justify their ex
istence," says Heaton Wrenn, '21, presi
dent of the Interfraternity Conference.
"Mistakes in the choice of membership
will be practically eliminated. Freshmen
will have to substantiate themselves in
the University before they will be con
sidered for membership. Fraternities
will grow from the idea of a social and
fraternal body, and will more or less
develop the earmarks of an honor so
ciety."
B. C. Wohlford, '18, Delta Kappa Ep
silon, says:
"The adoption of the May ■ pledging
system would be the big step forward
that fraternities have taken during their
existence at Stanford, and should put
them on an infinitely higher plane than
they now enjoy. It will substitute for
the frenzied, hasty rushing of freshmen,
a sane, orderly method of choosing men
that will fit into houses and be a credit
to them. Moreover, the freshman will
be on trial and have to prove himself,
with the result that he will go out for
athletics and good scholarship, to the
benefit not only of fraternities, but of
all Stanford.
"In considering the adoption of this
plan, one should look, not mainly to
the immediate consequences, for any
major change will bring some incon
venience until houses have become ad
justed to it, but to results over a period
of years. Viewed in this light, it seems
undisputable that the proposed change
will be a successful and beneficial one."

abling fraternities to justify their ex
istence," says Heaton Wrenn, '21, presi
dent of the Interfraternity Conference.
"Mistakes in the choice of membership
will be practically eliminated. Freshmen
will have to substantiate themselves in
the University before they will be con
sidered for membership. Fraternities
will grow from the idea of a social and
fraternal body, and will more or less
develop the earmarks of an honor so
ciety."
B. C. Wohlford, '18, Delta Kappa Ep
silon, says:
"The adoption of the May ■ pledging
system would be the big step forward
that fraternities have taken during their
existence at Stanford, and should put
them on an infinitely higher plane than
they now enjoy. It will substitute for
the frenzied, hasty rushing of freshmen,
a sane, orderly method of choosing men
that will fit into houses and be a credit
to them. Moreover, the freshman will
be on trial and have to prove himself,
with the result that he will go out for
athletics and good scholarship, to the
benefit not only of fraternities, but of
all Stanford.
"In considering the adoption of this
plan, one should look, not mainly to
the immediate consequences, for any
major change will bring some incon
venience until houses have become ad
justed to it, but to results over a period
of years. Viewed in this light, it seems
undisputable that the proposed change
will be a successful and beneficial one."
