# VANITY FAIR ENOUGH
## 
### 
After the Carnival has passed and we can look at
it calmly we are inspired to say that it was about the
best Carnival we have had. Ideas may differ as to
the amount of fun that was enjoyed by the crowds
both nights at the concessions and shows, but all
agree when you come down to facts that this year,
when the crowd kept straight, there was a whole lot
more fun iti the thing for the women performers.
Being the ones who came in for the greatest part of
the dance and show acts, they were the ones to be
considered rather than those who wanted to whoop
her up a bit.
When the first notices came out about this year's
Carnival there was a laugh over the thought of police
regulation of conduct bv students. It did sound
funny. But somehow the big idea was put across
and the crowd conducted itself in a satisfactory
manner. No rowdyism marked the moves of the
throngs up and down by the concessions and 110 dis
turbances arose in the shows.
This goes to demonstrate that the whole thing in
putting over a successful cclebradtion without the
attendant liquid exhilaration is to create in the crowd
the idea of "it isn't being done." This was done and
jflone well this year by the use of judicious publicity
by those in charge of the Carnival. The chairman
and his general committee are to be congratulated, as
well as the student body for being able to take the
bint and co-operate with the committee in putting on
a clean celebration.
