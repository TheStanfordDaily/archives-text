# NOT A SPRING PRACTICE
## 
### 
We note that a guy was smoking - on the Quad this
morning. He had on cords, so the report goes, and
carried books marking him as a student. Evidently
the gent was off the boat in spite of the fact that he
lias so far progressed as to don the cord. Occasion
ally such a yoyth comes to light upon the campus.
Let's hope he is now on the boat and knows that
smoking on the Quad is not done.
