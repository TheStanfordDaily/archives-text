# ATTENTION, LETTER MEN
## 
### 
This is the last week for football practice. War
ner will not be here until next spring. Now is the
time to get next to his style of play as there will be
no chance so intimate when lie is not here and when
the rush of getting a team picked is on in the fall. A
hundred men will be needed for the eight-team game
on Saturday. Tomorrow afternoon every football
man, old or new, should be out on the field and
should stay out for the rest of the week.
