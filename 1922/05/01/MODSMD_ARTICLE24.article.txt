BOOK REVUE
"Palmistry"— by Madame cie Sipher: The author
uses a palm fan, palmolive soap, can make jelly from
fruit of the palm tree, and is also an expert palmer, not
to say palmist. In this little book she tells of her ad
ventures while trying to palm off the famous Rarah
Diamonds, made of pure paste.
"Beasts of the Field" —by a former football Star.
In this book the author describes all the worst coaches
he has met and what he met them with. He drove a
Ford for a long time until the taxi company gave him
a Fumble Four to haul his passengers.
"Hyroglyphics"—by Sir Henessy-Henessy. Sir Hen
nessy-Hennessy, in this pamphlet tells of hunting these
ferocious brutes in the remotest wilds of Katchascatch
can. He describes how one hyroglyphic, maddened by
the stings of countless asterisks, almost —but buy the
book and read it yourself.
"How I Made a Million"—by Rufus Glogenchosen
heimer. In this illuminating essay (it burns well), Mr.
Glogenchosenheimer relates how he succeeded in mak
ing a million mistakes before he got seriously injured.
His third mistake after passing the million mark was to
offer a prohibition officer a drink, and Mr. Glogenchosen
heimer is now where he reach all the bars he wants.

They must have been, because none of 'em produced the

Thing in the air,
So they asked him to
Go
If he'd care;
And assist on the crank
But he answered "No Thank
You —
I might have to crank it up there!"

124.6 students were questioned on the Quad Friday.
They were asked:
(1) Are you the vainest man in the world?
(2) Are you good-looking, or merely handsome.
(3) Do you shine your own shoes?
(4) What is your monthly allowance?
In the first question 124.6 answered "yes," thinking
they had hit the gent with the ten bucks.
For the second query, 106 said "Well, my friends all
say so"; and the rest merely gave the questioner a hard
look.
Regarding the third question, 2 said they did. 107
indicated that they had done so at the start of the
quarter, and the rest had on cordovans and explafned
they didn't need to be shined.
For the fourth question, 124.6 told the questioner to

STATISTIC HOUND
124.6 students were questioned on the Quad Friday.
They were asked:
(1) Are you the vainest man in the world?
(2) Are you good-looking, or merely handsome.
(3) Do you shine your own shoes?
(4) What is your monthly allowance?
In the first question 124.6 answered "yes," thinking
they had hit the gent with the ten bucks.
For the second query, 106 said "Well, my friends all
say so"; and the rest merely gave the questioner a hard
look.
Regarding the third question, 2 said they did. 107
indicated that they had done so at the start of the
quarter, and the rest had on cordovans and explafned
they didn't need to be shined.
For the fourth question, 124.6 told the questioner to
?o someplace that isn't listed in the bawl-out.
