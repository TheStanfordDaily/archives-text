# NEARING AND BARNES MUSIC TO BE PLAYED
## 
### 
"The Old Mission," by Nearing, one
of the most expressive and colorful or
gan selections, will be played at the
Tuesday recital, May 2, at 4:15, in Me
morial Church. The events which take
place in an old monastery, from the ring
ing of the chimes at the opening of the
composition to the recessional at the
close, are easily imagined by the at
mosphere which Nearing creates.
In contrast to these are the composi
tions by Edward S. Barnes, American
composer, which are light and fanciful
in character. The following numbers
will compose the program:
The Old Mission Nearing
Scherzo 1
Toccata on a [Edward S. Barnes
Gregorian Theme....]
Litany Schubert
Triumphal March from "Aida" Verdi
