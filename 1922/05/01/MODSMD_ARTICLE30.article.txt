# LECTURER DESCRIBES GROWTH OF JAPANESE ART SCHOOL PRINTS
## 
### 
"The Development of Japanese Color
Prints" was the subject of an illustrat
ed talk given Friday evening in the
Little Theatre, before the members
of the Palo Alto Art Club, by Mrs.
Lucy Fletcher Brown. Mrs. Brown,
who is a travel lecturer and student
of Oriental art, is one of the leading
authorities on Japanese prints in the
United States, and her collection has
been pronounced by artists to be the
most beautiful in this country.
"The Japanese print is an art of
the common people," said Mrs. Brown,
"for it is they who make, buy, and
sell them. Prior to the seventeenth
century, the field of painting and art
was an exclusive enjoyment of the
artistocratic classes."
The speaker declared that the back
ground for the development of the
print was the Japanese fondness for
stories and fairy ta,les. 1650 was
the year in which the black and white
prints came into popularity, and it
was not until a hundred years later
that artists conceived the idea of fill
ing in their prints with colors. By
1800, the art was at the peak of its
perfection, Mrs. Brown said, and it
only remained then for Hokusai to
supply the final development.
