SANTA CLARA, May I.—The his
toric town of Santa Clara has been put
in order for the epochal events which
take place here commencing this even
ing, May Ist, when the Mission Santa
Clara Centenary Celebration is to com
mence. The highway and side-roads
have been put in perfect condition, with
orderly routing and diverting regula
tions, to prevent congestion during the
Centennial Week; the streets and prin
cipal buildings of the town are being
gayly decorated for the Centenary Cel
ebration ; and homes and business
houses will present an attractive appear
ance to the 150,000 or more visitors ex
pected here during the Centennial. Dr.
George L. Sullivan, chairman of the
Centenary Committee, declared Satur
day : "The coming Centennial will
probably be the means of placing Santa
Clara in the advantageous position of
being the most widely advertised town
in the entire state of California this
year; because already we are receiving
reports back from cities in foreign lands,
telling us of their having read of the
approaching celebration in Santa Clara.
Indeed, it seems that the saintly fig
ures of Padre Jose Maria del Real and
his devoted followers are being brought
back to life in a vivid and fascinating
manner; because the entire county has
become imbued with the romantic and
chivalrous spirit of the Centenary."
Probably the most beautiful of all
scenic creations will be the lavish deco
rative features of the interior of the
University of Santa Clara Theater,
where the "Mission Play of Santa Clara"
is to be presented. Mrs. Joseph H.
Wald of Santa Clara, assisted by a
•committee of fifty ladies from San Jose
and Santa Clara, has been engaged in
transforming the University Theater
into a gorgeous old Mission Garden,
that literally blooms with the soft, ra
diant atmosphere of the Garden of the
historic Mission Santa Clara, where the
Padres trod a century ago; but re-born,
through the devoted hands of the Santa
Clara Valley ladies, who have succeeded
in creating a remarkable interior effect
for the theater that will be the scene
of the Mission Play performers,
A complete and original musical score
has been composed for the "Mission
Play of Santa Clara" by Professor Sam
uel J. Mustol, dean of the College of
Mu sic of the University. The music com
prises an opening descriptive overture
•of operatic magnitude, and there are
three "entre acte" numbers of unusual
beauty and appropriate tone. In addi
tion, there is a complete setting of in
cidental music to accompany the action
of the play. Professor Mustol, who is a
•composer and musical director of note,
wwill personally conduct a large symph
ony orchestra at each performance of the
play. In the orchestra will be several
members of the San Jose Elks' orches
tra, who have volunteered their services
to assist in the musical presentation
accompanying the pageant-play.
