SANTA CLARA, May I.â€”The his
toric town of Santa Clara has been put
in order for the epochal events which
take place here commencing this even
ing, May Ist, when the Mission Santa
Clara Centenary Celebration is to com
mence. The highway and side-roads
have been put in perfect condition, with
orderly routing and diverting regula
tions, to prevent congestion during the
Centennial Week; the streets and prin
cipal buildings of the town are being
gayly decorated for the Centenary Cel
ebration ; and homes and business
houses will present an attractive appear
ance to the 150,000 or more visitors ex
pected here during the Centennial. Dr.
George L. Sullivan, chairman of the
Centenary Committee, declared Satur
day : "The coming Centennial will
probably be the means of placing Santa
Clara in the advantageous position of
being the most widely advertised town
in the entire state of California this
year; because already we are receiving
reports back from cities in foreign lands,
telling us of their having read of the
approaching celebration in Santa Clara.
Indeed, it seems that the saintly fig
ures of Padre Jose Maria del Real and
his devoted followers are being brought
back to life in a vivid and fascinating
manner; because the entire county has
become imbued with the romantic and
chivalrous spirit of the Centenary."
Probably the most beautiful of all
