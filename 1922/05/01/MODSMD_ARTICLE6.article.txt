# FRIVOLITY REIGNS OVER THRONGS AT SPRING CARNIVAL
## King, Queen Crowned Amid Jubilation; Two Thousand See Vanity Fair Opening 
### 
King Husky and Queen Neva ruled
for two days over a land of mirthful
revelry. Vanity Fair, its ultra-modern
theme carried out in every detail of
decoration and concession, offered pleas
ure seekers a novel way to spend their
time and money from the hour the royal
pair nervously ascended to their throne
Friday evening until the last dance of
the Carnival Ball was concluded at mid
night Saturday. Something like 2,000
people officiated the festivities on the
opening night, and accountants are still
feverishly counting up the proceeds.
The climax to the Carnival came on
Saturday night in the basketball pavil
ion. Ram's Head Ballet, with Dick
Pershing, Gene Trago, and a chorus of
eight which equaled the wildest dreams
of press agentry, danced across the
spring floor in the "Frivolity Fete" with
such variety of steps and alignments
that they threatened to surpass a pro
fessional revue. In the opening num
ber, "My Girl Is Like a Rainbow," Dick
Pershing was ably assisted by a bril
liant rainbow effect from the spotlights.
In the second offering. "I've Got My
Habits On," Gene Trago needed no as
sistance in his Bert Williams-Al Jolson
interpretation, and took his encores like
a man. Both songs, by the way, are
making their first appearance on this
coast.
The concessions of the 1922 Carnival
maintained a surprisingly uniform
standard of excellence. Originality, un
hampered by any period or nationality
motif, came to the front with a leap,
and several concessions competed close
ly for popularity and skill of presenta
tion. "Sally's Garret," a Greenwich vil
lage extravaganza offered by Alpha
Delta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma in
the boxing room of the gymnasium,
with Les Seib and Frances McGregor
leading, played to a packed house —or
ring—throughout the two nights. Out
side, on the Grand Promenade, "Coo
Coo Cutic," with. Sam Mendenhall's
female impersonators, did everything
but knock her audience off the benches
with laughter, though the chorus dis
played more form than grace. Sequoia
and Roble Clubs, working under the dif
ficulties of the barn-like wrestling room
and the technicality of a Winter Garden
runway, set "The Mouse Trap" with a
bait of delectable chorus girls, some
really remarkable dancing, and the in
evitable tragedy of Krazy Kat done in
Herriman's best form.
If it wasn't for the uproar of competi
tion going on in the gymnasium, Delta
Gamma and Phi Delta Theta would have
come in for a larger amount of enthu
siasm for "The Follies of Vanity Fair."
The chorus was unexcelled puechritud
inally, anyway, and the Waiters' Chant,
it was afterwards heard, was quite a
good satire on the highbrow Union
hasher, though nobody could hear it at
the time. Two dance concessions, later
reinforced by a third which gave up the
ghost of its revue attempt, outdid the
"Follies" and each other in everything
but harmony. Gamma Phi Beta and
Sigma Alphi Fpsilon had one of the
most novel of these, offering in "Paris
After Midnight,'' a sidewalk cabaret
with interests divided between dancing
and cider.
"The Vainest Man on Earth" has not
yet been found. Although he was
marching up and down the Grand
Promenade from 9 o'clock Saturday un

til adjournment to the Carnival Ball,
and worked out there until midnight, no
one asked him the fatal question. Frank
Spnrlock, the genial cop, was the hearer
of the ten-dollar gold piece.
Mechanical genius came to the fore in
at least two concessions. Theta Xi, with
their hot-air balloon race, defied all ef
forts to beat the game, and Phi Gamma
Delta, which had a line continually
waiting to take a chance on the ''Slide
the Glide" after the first bashfulness
had worn off, showed that a difficult
construction feat could be combined
with safe navigation, with an unexpect
ed back-flip thrown in.
Financial Director Paul Davis an
nounces that no statement of receipts
can be made until tomorrow, as check
ing of tickets, admissions and expenses
is still going on.

The chorus was unexcelled puechritud
inally, anyway, and the Waiters' Chant,
it was afterwards heard, was quite a
good satire on the highbrow Union
hasher, though nobody could hear it at
the time. Two dance concessions, later
reinforced by a third which gave up the
ghost of its revue attempt, outdid the
"Follies" and each other in everything
but harmony. Gamma Phi Beta and
Sigma Alphi Fpsilon had one of the
most novel of these, offering in "Paris
After Midnight,'' a sidewalk cabaret
with interests divided between dancing
and cider.
"The Vainest Man on Earth" has not
yet been found. Although he was
marching up and down the Grand
Promenade from 9 o'clock Saturday un

til adjournment to the Carnival Ball,
and worked out there until midnight, no
one asked him the fatal question. Frank
Spnrlock, the genial cop, was the hearer
of the ten-dollar gold piece.
Mechanical genius came to the fore in
at least two concessions. Theta Xi, with
their hot-air balloon race, defied all ef
forts to beat the game, and Phi Gamma
Delta, which had a line continually
waiting to take a chance on the ''Slide
the Glide" after the first bashfulness
had worn off, showed that a difficult
construction feat could be combined
with safe navigation, with an unexpect
ed back-flip thrown in.

King Husky and Queen Neva ruled
for two days over a land of mirthful
revelry. Vanity Fair, its ultra-modern
theme carried out in every detail of
decoration and concession, offered pleas
ure seekers a novel way to spend their
time and money from the hour the royal
pair nervously ascended to their throne
Friday evening until the last dance of
the Carnival Ball was concluded at mid
night Saturday. Something like 2,000
people officiated the festivities on the
opening night, and accountants are still
feverishly counting up the proceeds.
The climax to the Carnival came on
Saturday night in the basketball pavil
ion. Ram's Head Ballet, with Dick
Pershing, Gene Trago, and a chorus of
eight which equaled the wildest dreams
of press agentry, danced across the
spring floor in the "Frivolity Fete" with
such variety of steps and alignments
that they threatened to surpass a pro
fessional revue. In the opening num
ber, "My Girl Is Like a Rainbow," Dick
Pershing was ably assisted by a bril
liant rainbow effect from the spotlights.
In the second offering. "I've Got My
Habits On," Gene Trago needed no as
sistance in his Bert Williams-Al Jolson
interpretation, and took his encores like
a man. Both songs, by the way, are
making their first appearance on this
coast.
The concessions of the 1922 Carnival
maintained a surprisingly uniform
standard of excellence. Originality, un
hampered by any period or nationality
motif, came to the front with a leap,
and several concessions competed close
ly for popularity and skill of presenta
tion. "Sally's Garret," a Greenwich vil
lage extravaganza offered by Alpha
Delta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma in
the boxing room of the gymnasium,
with Les Seib and Frances McGregor
leading, played to a packed house —or
ring—throughout the two nights. Out
side, on the Grand Promenade, "Coo
Coo Cutic," with. Sam Mendenhall's
female impersonators, did everything
but knock her audience off the benches
with laughter, though the chorus dis
played more form than grace. Sequoia
and Roble Clubs, working under the dif
ficulties of the barn-like wrestling room
and the technicality of a Winter Garden
runway, set "The Mouse Trap" with a
bait of delectable chorus girls, some
really remarkable dancing, and the in
evitable tragedy of Krazy Kat done in
Herriman's best form.
If it wasn't for the uproar of competi
tion going on in the gymnasium, Delta
Gamma and Phi Delta Theta would have
come in for a larger amount of enthu
siasm for "The Follies of Vanity Fair."
