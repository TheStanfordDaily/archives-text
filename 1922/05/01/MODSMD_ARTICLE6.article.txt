# FRIVOLITY REIGNS OVER THRONGS AT SPRING CARNIVAL
## King, Queen Crowned Amid Jubilation; Two Thousand See Vanity Fair Opening 
### 
King Husky and Queen Neva ruled
for two days over a land of mirthful
revelry. Vanity Fair, its ultra-modern
theme carried out in every detail of
decoration and concession, offered pleas
ure seekers a novel way to spend their
time and money from the hour the royal
pair nervously ascended to their throne
Friday evening until the last dance of
the Carnival Ball was concluded at mid
night Saturday. Something like 2,000
people officiated the festivities on the
opening night, and accountants are still
feverishly counting up the proceeds.
The climax to the Carnival came on
Saturday night in the basketball pavil
ion. Ram's Head Ballet, with Dick
Pershing, Gene Trago, and a chorus of
eight which equaled the wildest dreams
of press agentry, danced across the
spring floor in the "Frivolity Fete" with
such variety of steps and alignments
that they threatened to surpass a pro
fessional revue. In the opening num
ber, "My Girl Is Like a Rainbow," Dick
Pershing was ably assisted by a bril
liant rainbow effect from the spotlights.
In the second offering. "I've Got My
Habits On," Gene Trago needed no as
sistance in his Bert Williams-Al Jolson
interpretation, and took his encores like
a man. Both songs, by the way, are
making their first appearance on this
coast.
The concessions of the 1922 Carnival
maintained a surprisingly uniform
standard of excellence. Originality, un
hampered by any period or nationality
motif, came to the front with a leap,
and several concessions competed close
ly for popularity and skill of presenta
tion. "Sally's Garret," a Greenwich vil
lage extravaganza offered by Alpha
Delta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma in
the boxing room of the gymnasium,
with Les Seib and Frances McGregor
leading, played to a packed house —or
ring—throughout the two nights. Out
side, on the Grand Promenade, "Coo
Coo Cutic," with. Sam Mendenhall's
female impersonators, did everything
but knock her audience off the benches
with laughter, though the chorus dis
played more form than grace. Sequoia
