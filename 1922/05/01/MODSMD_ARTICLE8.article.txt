# LAST CALL FOR FOOTBALL!
## 
### 
Every man who has been a member of the varsity squad in the last
year, and who expects to try out for the team next year, and every other
man who has been issued a suit this spring is earnestly requested to be out
for practice every day this week. Regular teams are to be picked tomorrow
which will practice togehter each day this week, and play in the final
game next Saturday. It is therefore essential that every one be on hand for
all the practices in order that there may be a good game an Saturday. Men
must know their positions and the plays that will be learned this week.
The Game Saturday is to be regulation length, in which fresh teams
will oppose each other each quarter; eight teams being seen in action dur
ing the game.
This will be Coach Warner's last week with the Stanford football squad
until next spring. His unlimited fund of knowledge of the American game,
together with his ability as a critic has manifested itself many times during
the spring practice. There is no one so good or so perfect that Warner
cannot improve him. Therefore let's see every man out this week, and not
only show Warner a big turnout but take advantage of the wonderful oppor
tunity offered us, that of being coached by the greatest of America's football
coaches.
