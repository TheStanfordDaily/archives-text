SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY,
May 2.â€”Four months of active prepara
tion on the part of Santa Clara's stu
dents will be rewarded when the first
performance of the "Mission Play of
Santa Clara" is given tonight. The
drama, written by Martin V. Merle, '06,
was first produced in 1913, when it
scored a great success.
Merle wrote the play in fulfillment of
a promise made to the late Rev. Robert
E. Kenna, former president of the uni
versity. One of the conditions of the
promise was that it should never be pro-

duced outside the walls of the Mission
college.
Back in 1906 when Merle was an un
dergraduate at Santa Clara he wrote
"The Light Eternal," little dreaming
that it would later play to packed houses
in New York, Chicago, and San Fran
cisco under the direction of David Be
lasco. Other successes from the pen of
Merle are "The Feud," "In Lolita's Gar
den," and "The Vagabond Prince." Dur
ing the war he was overseas commis
sioner for the Knights of Columbus in
France, and is credited with originating
the stunt of dropping cigarette packs on
the advancing troops from the air.
There are three acts with sixteen
speaking parts in the play, with an en
semble of sixty students of the university
and prep school. The time of the play is
about three hours.
