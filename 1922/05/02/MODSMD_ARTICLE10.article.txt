more baseball fight yesterday afternoon,
the day's schedule of games being post
poned until today. The dates will all be
set back one day until an open date
makes it possible to resume the regular
playing dates.
This afternoon's contests open the
third round, and will bring Delta Chi
into action against Alpha Sigma Phi,
Encina No. Two will play Beta Theta Pi.
Alpha Delta Phi meets El Toro, Theta
Chi tangles with Kappa Sigma, and El
Campo mixes with Delta Tail Delta.
The brand of baseball played in these
games is improving with each succeeding
round, and the "little world's series" at
the end of the season may display some
real baseball talent.
