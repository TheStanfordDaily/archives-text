# JUNIOR OPERA SCORE HAS CLEVER NUMBERS
## Repetition Of Theme Songs Will Be Tried First Time 
### 
Composers already known for their
work in former productions, as well
as two newcomers, have contributed
to the musical score of this year's
junior opera. These will be sung by
choruses with unusually well-trained
voices.
The practice of emphasizing the
best numbers by repetition will be
tried out for the first time in the 1923
opera. The theme song which will
open and close the opera is a combi
nation number, "Up On a Ladder" and
"Hello," written by Richard Malaby,
'23, and Charles Midgeley, '23. An
other one of the songs which will run
through the entire show is "Trouble,"
by Midgeley.
The two new contributors are Harry
Kennedy, '24, and Alice Dodds, '25.
Kennedy has written a catchy num
ber, "I'll Never Tell," and Miss Dodds
is the composer of an instrumental
dance.
One of the cleverest musical bits of
the evening will be "Youth and Age,"
by Malaby, in which there is a fast
counter melody over a slower melody,
which is artistically worked out. An
other number by the same composer

is "Saxaphone Blues," in which the
orchestra saxaphones will be featured.
In addition to directing all the
music for the opera, Midgeley has
written a number of the pieces which
the campus will be humming after the
show itself has become a thing of the
past. One of these is "Radio Love,"
a lively one-step, for which Dan Evans,
'20, has written an amusing lyric.
Evans wrote the words for all but the
one number by Tom Kleckner, '19.
The two imps, Foresta Hodgson, '24,
and Helen Whitney, '24, who dance
in and out through all the acts, will
give the specialty ballet russe which
opens the second act. Midgeley wrote
the accompaniment. His other num
bers are "Little Feet," the only waltz,
and the catchy "Recipe."
Myron Higby, '22, has contributed
a fox trot, "Mountain Rose," and Lloyd
Howard's fox trot, "By Your Side,"
will complete the score.
All these numbers will be played
by a sixteen-piece orchestra, the larg
est yet for a Junior Opera. The
choruses of every number to be used
for the show will be published in a
book which will be sold on the even
ing of May 13.
