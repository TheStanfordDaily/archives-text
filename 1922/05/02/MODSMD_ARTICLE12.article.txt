# INTER-FRATERNITY SWIMMING TEAMS TO COMPETE SATURDAY
## 
### 
The fifth annual inter-fraternity
swimming meet will take place next
Saturday afternoon at 2:30, at Encina
pool. Coach Ernie Brandsten plans to
make this the largest inter-group con
test that has ever been held at Stan
ford. The regular inter-collegiate
events which will be held are the 50,
100, 220-yard swims, the breast stroke,
back stroke, diving, plunge and the
four-man relay race.
The winner of the meet will have
possession of the Wideman trophy,
which is a perpetual prize, for one
year. The name of the victorious
team is engraved on the trophy. Last
year the Alpha Sigma Phi team car
ried away first honors with a good
margin over-the Phi Delta Theta team
which was second. The Delta Tau
Delta mermen won the contest in 1920,
while the Chi Psi team showed the
most ability in the two previous years.
This year several organizations have
teams that should make a strong bid
for the trophy.
Four places will count in each event.
In the relay race first place will score
8 points, second 6, third 4 and foufth
2. Coach Brandsten desires to have
a representative of each organization
see him within the next few days.
Several groups have already started
practice at the pool in order to pick
the men best qualified to represent
them.
