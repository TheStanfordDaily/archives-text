# FRATERNITIES DELAY FINAL VOTE ON PLAN FOR YEAR'S RUSHING
## 
### 
Representatives at the Interfraternity
Conference meeting last evening voted
to hold over consideration of the May
pledging system for a week. When the
proposed rushing system was brought to
a tentative vote, seven chapters were for
the plan, four were conditional, and
twelve were against it.
Every house on the campus was rep
resented and nearly all took part in an
'informal discussion which lasted for
two hours. Proposals for rushing sys
tems included many different plans.
Sonic wanted the old one-day rushing,
while others desired to have the present
thirteen-day period retained. Two rep
resentatives supported the one-year
pledging plan with no rushing, that is,
not having freshmen at the fraternity
houses.
Several houses proposed that the May
pledging system be adopted for 1923, at
which time it is probable that all fresh
men will live in a dormitory for one
year. President Wilbur may speak to
the Conference at its next meeting to ex
plain his views on fraternity pledging
with regard to the conditions which will
exist as soon as the new freshman dorm
itories are put in.
