# Old-Timers Given Chance For Expression In Chappie
## 
### 
"Other Days," will be the cognomen
of the forthcoming issue of Chaparral,
in which old-timers and futurists will be
given a chance to come to the bat with
statistics on past and predicted events.
No limit is set on the style or number
of contributions desired by the editor at
once. Foolish fantasies of the future,
querulous quips about pastimes in times
past, original literary forms, sentimental
and nonsensical fables, and clever con
ceits about the world in general and par
ticular, arc declared eligible is mailed
before Monday, May 8.
