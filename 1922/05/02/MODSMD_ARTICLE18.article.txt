# MARGARET BAILIE TO FILL HERO ROLE IN SPRING PAGEANT
## Dances and Pantomime Will Portray Events in Roman Occupation of Britain 
### 
Margaret Bailie, '24, will play the
role of Varrius, the hero in the Spring
Pageant which will take place Satur
day from 4 to 6, on the banks of the
lake. Varrius is a Roman lieutenant
who has been sent to Britain in the
early days of the Roman occupation
of that country. This part calls for
only one dance, a love-making fantasy
with Randalin, but it requires more
emotional acting than that of any
other character in the pageant. In the
development of the plot, Varrius is
unjustly accused of conspiring against
the republic and is stripped of his
military honors by the Roman gover
nor, Aulus. When he is left alone
after his disgrace, Varrius dejectedly
picks up the halves of his broken
sword and slinks off to the British vil
lage.
Miss Bailie is also directing all of
the pantomime of the pageant and js
stage director of the entire pageant.
Octavia, the daughter of the Roman
governor, is partrayed by Helen Whit
ney, '24. Octavia is a jealous, high
tempered girl who is furious when she
discovers that her lover ia deserting
her for a Britain maiden. At first, she
calls to her followers to dance for
him. Finding that he pays no atten
tion to them, Octavia herself dances
to attract him. When this proves to
be of no avail, she becomes angry,
whirling over the stage, working heV
self into a fury.
In the role of Randalin, Foresta
Hodgson, '24, is the niece of the Bri
tain chief, Vortiger. When she first
appears, she dances before the altar
of the goddess Freya, in whose honor
the Britains are holding a festival.
She is accused, with Varrius, of trea
son against the Roman government
and held captive by the officials of
that country. Randalin also dances in
a duet with Varrius.
Mary Matthews, '22, is the conquer
ed Britain chief, Vortiger, who al
though he has been vanquished by the
Romans, maintains his dignity and
poise and is fearless in attempting to
intercede for his niece when she is
accused by the Romans.
Aulus, the pompous and over-bear-
ing Roman governor, is played by
Mary Learnard, '23. Aulus' only
grandeur lies in that lent him by the
prestige of the Empire, for he him
self is an impulsive, conceited man
who roles tyrannically.
A rehearsal of,the entire cast of the
pageant will be held tomorrow after
noon at 4 o'clock at the lake stage.
Part of the orchestra will accompany
this practice.
