## Dances and Pantomime Will Portray Events in Roman Occupation of Britain 
### 
Margaret Bailie, '24, will play the
role of Varrius, the hero in the Spring
Pageant which will take place Satur
day from 4 to 6, on the banks of the
lake. Varrius is a Roman lieutenant
who has been sent to Britain in the
early days of the Roman occupation
of that country. This part calls for
only one dance, a love-making fantasy
with Randalin, but it requires more
emotional acting than that of any

development of the plot, Varrius is
unjustly accused of conspiring against
the republic and is stripped of his
military honors by the Roman gover
