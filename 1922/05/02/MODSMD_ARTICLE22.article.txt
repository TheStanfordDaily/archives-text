# A 						GOOD FIGHT BUT LONG
## 
### 
Hie baseball fight yesterday was one of the best
that we have even seen as far as hard fighting and
willingness to mix goes. From the minute the ball
was tossed out on the field to the time when it was
passed back to the Captain in the bleachers there was
no lull in the fighting. The heat of the afternoon
made the fight seem harder when men from first
one side and the other began to pass out, but after
all there was no one hurt seriously.
The fall of the wire netting was unfortunate,
coming without warning on the heads of the fighters,
but that was no fault of either side. As long as the
fighting was clean on both sides and no bad after
effects resulted we think that the 1924 and 1925
classes have behaved very creditably in helping to
preserve a traditional struggle which might have
languished with so many other worthv has-beens.
