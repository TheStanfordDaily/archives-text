# SANTA CLARA'S CENTENNIAL
## 
### 
Tonight Santa Clara is opening her tercentennial
celebration with the first presentation of the Merle
"Mission Play." This play has been written by an
alumnus of Santa Clara especially for his Alma Ma
ter. It depicts the life in the Santa Clara Valley in
the early part of the last century about the time when
the Americans were first coming in to the country in
any considerable numbers.
The University of Santa Clara has been put in
shape for the presentation of the Mission Play, and
the town is host to the people who will be present
to witness this drama of the "early days" of the
Golden J-^ite.
All parts of the play are taken by students in Santa
Clara University. The theater has been decorated
with old-style drapes and early Spanish trappings to
make the atmosphere as true of the old days as
possible.
No expense has been spared in making the play a
success. Several months of hard work has been put
into the preparation by members of the student body,
and they have a show now that will be a credit to
them. It is an excellent thing to be put on by mem
bers pf any college as a commemorative play in honor
of their institution.
