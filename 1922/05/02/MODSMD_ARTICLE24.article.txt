# WHAT ABOUT THE "S"
## 
### 
While it is no matter of life or death, and while
the health and prosperity of the student manager
system and major sports are dependent neither on its
continued use or abandonment, the newly adopted
custom of awarding a specially designated letter to
managers of the several sports does not seem in
keeping with the Stanford idea of the block "S."
A Stanford "S" of any kind before this year has
always meant proficiency in one line of six>rt. It
signalizes endeavor and success in athletic achieve
ment, in physical competition with athletes of other
universities. Whether or not this is more or less
important, more or less worthy of reward, than man
agership of sports, is immaterial. The point is that
proficiency in athletics is not the same thing as suc
cess in managing a sjwrt, and the "S" has long stood
for the former, and not anything else.
In adopting the bar "S" are we not departing from
the traditional idea of the Stanford "S"? Are there
not ways of properly rewarding managers without
infringing on the realm of athletic competition? It
has been said tliat there arc other universities which
award managers with letters. So there are, and

some of them award debaters also with letters.
Their idea of a letter had not been our conception of
the Stanford "S." Debaters and managers are
thoroughly deserving of rewards, some of tlieni more
so than many athletes, but this does not mean that
they should be given the athletes' reward. They
should be rewarded in a manner as peculiarly sig
nificant of their line of endeavor as the block "S" is
of major sports, and the sphere and import of the
"S" should remain what is always has been at Stan
ford.
