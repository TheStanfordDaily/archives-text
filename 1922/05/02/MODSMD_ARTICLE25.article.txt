A Freshman queened (alas) last week.
She hung close to his side.
The whiskerettes rubbed off his cheek—
"To late for Herpicide."
—From the Doom Book.
• • •
This week's pointless joke:
He: —That bootblack there must have a brilliant mind.
She: —Why do you think so?
He (with a sneering laugh):—He is a shining suc
cess.
* • «
Stuck
When girls first wore sorority pins,
They pinned them on their waist,
But now that clothes have got so scarce,
They put them on with paste!
• • •
"Nobody Knows How Dry I Am" —Song of the Arizona
cactus.
"I Ain't Nobody's Darling"—Sung by A. Smith, Novem
ber 24, '22.
"I Never Knew" —Chorus by those flunking exams.
"Kiss Me Again"—Cactus garden national anthem.
"That 'Gin Gin Ginny Shore" —or, "From 'Frisco to
San Jose."
• • •
I know stories that whistle and snap thru your lijs,
I could tell things to put our bright sun in eclipse,
I could, but I won't, and I won't 'cause I fear,
One with something on me, may perhaps overhear.
mm*
I sing of mankind, and the shocking disaster,
That has fallen the refuge where once we'd repair,
The place of all places where man was the master.
Where fellows could smoke, chew, and —yes, even swear,
For now, since the ladies are bobbing their hear,
The universe seems to be all out of gear,
The barbershop now is the home of the fair,
Oh, where is the refuge of yesteryear?
No longer the mirrors, the paper, the plaster,
Will do, or the arc-light's unshaded glare,
Now that woman has come here, we'd not put it past her,
Should she declare such a setting too bare,
And insist on old tapestries, draperies rare,
Light-shades of parchment, ornaments queer,
Causing old-timers to cry in despair, •
"Oh, where is the refuge of yesteryear?"
And indeed our chagrin has grown vaster and vaster,
With more of the sisters invading our lair.
Bringing their necks, white as rare alabaster,
Here for a shave —for that nof is the flair—
Or to have their long tresses cut off Dutch and square,
That is a change in the barbers' career.
And hardy is he who will much longer dare,
Oh, where is the refuge of yesteryear?
ENVOI.
And so, dainty damsels, ensconsed in our chair.
We beg only this: that you never will jeer.
When we cry from the skeins of a sink-tangled lair,
"Oh, where -Is the refuge of yesteryear?"
—Pelican.
• • *
It is bad enough t ohave the festive picnic party
scatter crumbs and papers over the Art Museum, Lib
rary steps, and Inner Quad. But it is far worse io have
a nice old lady ask you why they don't have drinking
faucets near the Art steps—"Cheese sandwishes are so
dry."
* * *
No newspaper is complete nowadays without its bit
of verse of the Edgar A. Guest variety. After inspect
ing insane asylums all over the world the hunt narrow
ed down until the investigators had to comb the Panama
Locks. At great expense the operator of steam-shovel
No. 67 was convinced that he was not the man upon
whom depended the success of the great engineering
venture, and after further and lavish outlay on all man
ner of apparatus, specialists finally convinced him that
he had reached the level of a newspaper poet and should
heed to the beck of the calling. The first offering of
our chosen rival to Edgar, Shamus Shovelfoot, is here
presented. He will have many more, to be billed under
catch-as-catch-can rules.
• ♦ •
We have been wonder what the librarian meant when
she said that only low conversation was permitted.

"TRUE ENOUGH," SAID THE CARPENTER AS HE
LAID DOWN THE PLANE.
