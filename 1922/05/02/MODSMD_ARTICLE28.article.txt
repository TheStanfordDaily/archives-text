PROGRESS OF CIVIL WAR IN
CHINA
Severe fighting in the neighborhood
of Peking continues between the for
ces of Chang-Tso-lin and Wu Pei Fu.
Neither chief pays any apparent at
tion to the wishes of the central gov
ernment. According to a majority of
reports, General Chang, the Manchuri
an leader, is on the whole successful.
He accuses General Wu of imperial
istic ambitions and declares that he is
merely defending China from a would
be tyrant. Doctor Sun Yat Sen, head
of tbe Canton government, is expected
to join forces with Chang to destroy
Wu. This would mean the elimina
tion of one of the war lords and would
help to lessen complications.
American and Italian gunboats have
been sent to Tsientsin to protect the
foreign population.
ALLIES DEMAND RUSSIA ASSUME
DEBTS OF CZAR AND KERENSKY
The allied leaders at Genoa have
decided to present Russia with an
ultimatum conditinoing their recogni
tion of the de facto government on the
assumption that Russia must renounce
all claims upon the Allies for damage
done by the White Armies which were
financed by the Allies. If Russia
agree to this ultimatum, the Allies
promise to consider the reduction of
the Russian debt to them. They are
not willing to say how much they
will reduce it until they learn the re
sult of their negotiations with the
United States Debt Funding Commis
sion.
A mixed financial tribunal is pro
posed to deal with Russian debts. The
chairman of this tribunal will be
chosen by the Chief Justice of the
United States Supreme Court, one of
the members by the Russian ahd one
by the foreign bond holders.
Trotsky declared at a May Day cele
bration in Moscow that "Russia will
resist, until her last drop of blood is
gone, any attempt of the capitalistic
governments to enslave her." If he
represents Russian sentiment it is
quite unlikely that Russia will accept
the ultimatum.
