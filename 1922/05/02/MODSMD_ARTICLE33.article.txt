# Captain J.D. Houser Tells Of Employment Relations Work
## 
### Walt Warren, '22 
Stanford graduates in San Francisco
have started a new and distinct form of
civic enterprise, the Employment Rela
tions Association. This is the first or
ganization of its kind in America, and
will perform a unique service in pro
moting harmony in the industrial world.
The founders are J. D. Houser. '10, W.
E. Talbert, '13, and F. A. Scofield, '11.
"The aim of the association is to stim
ulate co-operation between the employers
and employees of the Pacific coast," said
Houser. "The methods to be used for
this task are three: first, the education
of the warring elements, capital and la
bor; second, the conducting of research
work in regard to employment problems;
and third, co-operation with managerial
staffs in the industrial plants."
The Employment Relations Associa
tion is the outgrowth of a private enter
prise started by the three Stanford men
shortly after the end of the war. It
was first called the Rureau of Manage
ment Research, and sought to secure em
ployment for men according to individual
abilities, train them after placing them,
and intensify their interest in the job
itself.
"The project received encouraging co
operation from business men in San
Francisco," Houser continued. "Grad
ually the conviction grew that the work
was too much of a public nature to be

confined to a private concern, and plans
were made for the formation of the
larger association.
"Whiting Williams' speech in the as
sembly was the first of a series he is
giving about the bay regions to interest
the public, as well as the workers and
employers, in the undertaking.
"The hostility between the business
heads and the workmen is causing a vast
amount of waste in the processes of pro
duction, and more than that, it is a grave
menace to social development. Our aim
is to bring these clashing factions to
gether by getting each to see the view
point of the other, and by increasing the
store of information on employment re
lations.
"President Wilbur and Archbishop
Hanna are members of the board of di
rectors, and they will supervise the ac
tivities of the association on the public
information side. Several of the lead
ing business men of San Francisco are
on the board. G. P. Wood, '21, is an
other Stanforl man associated with us.
"The plan is to carry on educational
work in three lines : with the manage
ment, the workers, and the public. This
program of instruction will be based on
the findings of extensive research in the
industrial field. The education will be
made effective through co-operation
with the executive staff of each plant."

tions Association. This is the first or
ganization of its kind in America, and
will perform a unique service in pro
moting harmony in the industrial world.
The founders are J. D. Houser. '10, W.
E. Talbert, '13, and F. A. Scofield, '11.
"The aim of the association is to stim
ulate co-operation between the employers
and employees of the Pacific coast," said
Houser. "The methods to be used for
this task are three: first, the education
of the warring elements, capital and la
bor; second, the conducting of research
work in regard to employment problems;
and third, co-operation with managerial
staffs in the industrial plants."
The Employment Relations Associa
tion is the outgrowth of a private enter
prise started by the three Stanford men
shortly after the end of the war. It
was first called the Rureau of Manage
ment Research, and sought to secure em
ployment for men according to individual
abilities, train them after placing them,
and intensify their interest in the job
itself.
"The project received encouraging co
operation from business men in San
Francisco," Houser continued. "Grad
ually the conviction grew that the work
was too much of a public nature to be

confined to a private concern, and plans
were made for the formation of the
larger association.
"Whiting Williams' speech in the as
sembly was the first of a series he is
giving about the bay regions to interest
the public, as well as the workers and
employers, in the undertaking.
"The hostility between the business
heads and the workmen is causing a vast
amount of waste in the processes of pro
duction, and more than that, it is a grave
menace to social development. Our aim
is to bring these clashing factions to
gether by getting each to see the view
point of the other, and by increasing the
store of information on employment re
lations.
"President Wilbur and Archbishop
Hanna are members of the board of di
rectors, and they will supervise the ac
tivities of the association on the public
information side. Several of the lead
ing business men of San Francisco are
on the board. G. P. Wood, '21, is an
other Stanforl man associated with us.
"The plan is to carry on educational
work in three lines : with the manage
ment, the workers, and the public. This
program of instruction will be based on
the findings of extensive research in the
industrial field. The education will be
made effective through co-operation
with the executive staff of each plant."
