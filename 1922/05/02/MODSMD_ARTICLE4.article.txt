# "Sally's Garret" Awarded Newman Carnival Trophy; Encina Offering Second
## 
### 
"Sally's Garret," presented by Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Alpha Delta Phi,
won the J. F. Newman trophy for the
most artistic and profitable concession at
Vanity Fair, by a decision of the judges
last night, after full financial returns
had been computed. Encina Club, with
"Coo Coo Cutie," came second in the
competition, "The Mouse Trap," offered
by Sequoia and Roble clubs, was third,
and Kappa Sigma's hot dog emporiums
took in enough money to make fourth
place.
"Sally's Garret" was well ahead of any
other concession in cash returns, and in
addition undertook all production ex
penses and cost of sets, besides clearing
up the boxing room, in which the act
was staged, immediately after the close
of the Carnival.
