# SOPHOMORES WIN ANNUAL BASEBALL FIGHT WITH BABES
## Victory Comes After Thirty Minutes' Intensive Fighting on Varsity Baseball Field 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
In accordance with tradition, the
sophomore class of 1924, with an or
ganization unsurpassable, worked its
way through to a victory over the rival
freshmen, in the annual baseball fight
held on the varsity diamond yesterday
afternoon. Both sides, of almost equal
strength, fought doggedly for a full
half-hour, when the '24 men were
finally successful in placing the mark
ed sphere in Captain Green's hands.
Fistic combat was taboo, but the fight
ing, ferocity, and fearlessness ran at
such a high pitch that supporters of
the rough and tumble could not have
wished for a better exhibition.
Predictions as to the outcome of
the fight, gave the '24 men a victory
in the first five minutes, and this prob
ably would have been true had it not
been for the false action of one of its
members who occupied a crucial posi
tion. With the older class doing field
duty in the third inning of the diamond
game between the rical teams. Captain
Green tossed the ball into centerfield.
At that, both classes made ferocious
plunges across the diamond, and by
such rough and unsual meetings, quick
ly began a polishing oft' of the field.
Meanwhile, the '24 organization be
gan to show its effects. The fleet
Bob Jannsen secured the ball, and
made a phenomenal 50-yard run
through a broken field, ably assisted
by the defensive work of a handful
of specially picked men. The marked
sphere left his hands, for the out
stretched palms of a fellow classmate
hanging to the diamond backstop.
Perhaps it was nervousness, but what
ver was the cause, the latter dropped
it, and the fight which might have
been won in five minutes, was forced
to continue for thirty.
A goodly portion of the battlers in
the outfields, suddenly seemed to real
ize after the first thrill of combat had
\vumiiiucu uuiii jmkt if
bfeen duly indulged in, that the scene
or actual fighting had shifted. The
few who were able to break away from
the deadly embraces, rejoined the
battle now raging in front of the
backstop.
-At the end of twenty minutes of
embroilment, the freshmen attempted
the use of strategy to turn the tide
of battle. A pistol was fired, and it
was anticipated that the older class
would cease battling and retire, there
by offering the first year men a chance
to rush the ball to Captain Green. The
table were turned however, and several
'25 men momentarily stopped fight
ing, much to the exasperation of,
their leaders.
The last five minutes of the brawl i
I

were the fiercest of all, as most of
the casualties and bruised backs oc
curred during this period. The in
censed .freshmen started a new of
fensive in a final attempt to pierce the
sophomore's right defensive flank.
The attack was repulsed, and soon
after Bob Playter was successful in
handing the ball to Captain Green.
Meanwhile, the 1924 poster commit
tee had been slapping down death
posters to '25 at random on the green
fence surrounding the field, and were
carrying the placards of atrocities to
foreign parts.
The serpentine of the winning class
was featured by daring displays, as
the sophomores had adopted bare
chests, arms, and backs, as the means
of distinguishing themselves during
the fight.
