# DR. JORDAN CLEARS UP VAGUE SPOTS IN STANFORD HISTORY
## 
### 
Tn a recent issue of the Daily Palo
Alto Times an historical sketch was
given about the founding of the Stan
ford estate, and a letter by Dr. Jordan
which perhaps clears up some of the
vague conceptions now held by students
as to some points which appeared in the
aforesaid article. The letter which was
addressed to the editor of tiie Times is
as follows:
"In your issue of April 21 you have
given a very interesting account of why
Palo Alto rather than Menlo Park was
chosen as a site for Stanford University,
but the author seems to forget that Palo
Alto was not the name of a town at that
time, but of the estate itself, derived
from the 'tall tree' at its northern angle.
"When the university opened, there
was but one old shack with a barn on
the grounds now occupied by the city
of Palo Alto, and the sign-post by the
track indicated that workmen on the uni
versity might get off at that point. For
a number of years there was no station.
The first one was a boxcar set on a
siding.
"The famous horse, Palo Alto, died in
1893, before there was any town of that
name. The ground had been laid out
under the name of Palo Alto Park, and
Palo Alto was the university post office.
The horse was named for the estate, and
the estate for the tall tree.
"Lake Lagunita was present when the
university was built, but it had no name
and was drained off every suihmer. The
stables stood and still stand beyond the
lake. The stud of horses was not
broken up at the death of the Senator,
but about 1896, when the university
found that it could not stand the ex
pense of keeping it up.
"Very truly yours,
"David Starr Tordan."
