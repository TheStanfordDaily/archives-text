THAT'S OUR IDEA in making CAMELS —the
Quality Cigarette.
Why, just buy Camels and look at the package! It's
the best packing science has devised to keep cigarettes
fresh and full flavored for your taste. Heavy paper out
side—secure foil wrapping inside and the revenue stamp
over the end to seal the package and keep it air-tight.
lAnd note this! There's nothing flashy about the Camel
package. No extra wrappings that do not improve the
smoke. Not a cent of needless expense that must come
out of the quality of the tobacco.
Camels wonderful and exclusive Quality wins on merit
alone.
Because, men smoke Camels who want the taste and
fragrance of the finest tobaccos, expertly blended. Men
smoke Camels for Camels smooth, refreshing mildness
I and their freedom from cigaretty aftertaste.
Camels are made for men who think for themselves.
