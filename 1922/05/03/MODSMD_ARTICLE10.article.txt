# WASHINGTON 'SUN DODGER' SUSPENDED

### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON
(P. I. N. S.) â€”The Sundodger, comic
publication of Hammer and Coffin, hon
orary publishing fraternity, has been
suspended by the committee on publica
tions of the university. The reason for
its action was that the Sundodger has
never published the type of humor that
the committee had hoped for when it
gave its consent to the founding of the
magazine in June, 1919.
In May, 1920, the staff was warned
that the class of wit turned out by Sun
dodger was anything but what was de
sired. namely, "if another number," re
ferring to the May number, "transgresses
the decency observed in good society, the
publication of the Sundodger will have
to cease publication at once."
