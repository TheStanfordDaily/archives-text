# BOOKS ON TRAVEL ARE RECEIVED AT LIBRARY
## 
### 
"Nearly everyone at some time in his
life wants to travel through strange
lands. Rut not all of us are fortunate
enough to carry out this desire. It is for
the people who stay at home that I have
related the story of my adventures in
the South Sea Islands," wrote Frederick
O'Brien. '"White Shadows of the South
Seas" and "Mystic Islands of the South
Seas," two of the works of this writer,
have been placed on the new bok shelf
at the library for this week. In the first
book the author gives a vivid account of
his adventures with the native hunters,
priests, and cannibal chiefs, of the
Atuona Valley. The second book tells
about the author's experiences in Tahiti
and Moorea. In speaking of Mr. O'Brien,
the New York Times says,"He is a
princc among narrators." The Outlook
also writes, "Mr. O'Brien presents un
usual material, history, and fulk-lore in
an interestinc fashion."
