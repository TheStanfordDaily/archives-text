# PUBLIC SALE OF PROM TICKETS TO CLOSE TOMORROW
## Junior Class Plans Extensive Decorations and Lighting Requiring Week's Work 
### 
Junior Prom tickets will go on public
sale for the last time tomorrow afternoon
from 1 until 3 o'clock at the Bookstore.
After Thursday tickets may be bought
from Lloyd Tritle, chairman of the Prom
committee, at the Delta Chi house.
However, late purchasers will have to
run the risk of not receiving a program,
since the order for programs must be
sent in Friday. The few extra which
will be printed will be distributed in or
der of application. The order for cater
ing service will also be made on Friday.
Members of the Prom committee have
formulated their plans, and will begin
putting them into effect the first of next
week. Edward Farmer, '23, has been
working on the indirect lighting, plan
ning a system of color-shades which win
be in harmony with the decorations,
which carry out the theme of spring
time. Light from the battery of reflec
tors in the pavilion will filter through a
mass of streamers which will form a
brilliant canopy over'the dancing floor.
The committee is in communication
with authorities on acoustics and is
planning a practical sounding board to
direct the music of the orchestra toward
the dancers. In the pavilion dances this
year it has been evident that much of
the effectiveness of the orchestra has
been lost because the sounds of the in
struments were allowed to shoot out in
every direction. The type of sounding
board being considered at present is
something like a handstand, but this plan
has not been definitely decided upon.
One of the main reasons for selecting
an elaborate dccorative scheme for this
year's Prom was the fact that a week's
work by members of the junior class
was counted on. This has been impos
sible in the past on account of the En
cina gymnasium room being in use dur
ing the week. The rough materials for
decorations have arrived and a meeting
of juniors will he held at 1 o'clock Fri
day in room 214 to make arrangements
for starting work. Considerable car
pentering v/ill be necessary to put up the
framework planned.
