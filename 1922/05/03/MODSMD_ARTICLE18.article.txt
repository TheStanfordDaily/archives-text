### 
John J. Cuddy, lecturer in advertis
ing at Stanford, who is connected with
the H. K. McCann Company, national
advertisers of New York and San Fran
cisco, was the speaker at the banquet
of the Stanford Advertising Club, held
last night in the New "Union.
Mr. Cuddy, in his talk, outlined a
consolidation plan for campus adver
tising. He suggested that the man
agers of the various campus publica
tions form an executive committee,
which would be a policy determining
body. Under this committee would
be research and copy departments, the
function of the former being to gather
statistical information on the campus,
for the advertisers, and the function of
the second, to assist advertisers in the
preparation of their copy.
Mr. Cuddy's plan also included one
general "White Space" seller, an ex
perienced man who would represent
all the publications in selling space to
advertisers. By this plan, it was
pointed out, a duplication of work
would be eliminated and a compre
hensive schedule for weeks in advance
could be arranged.
The club is now affiliated with the
Associated Advertising Clubs of the
Wrld.
