# Rifle Club Holds First Shoot of Spring Quarter
## 
### 
The first competition of the Rifle
Club's schedule for the spring quar
ter, held Saturday afternoon, was in
the nature of an individual "free-for
all" shoot, in which nine men shot
scores at 200 and 300 yards. As is
usual at the first of the season, no
high scores appeared, but much good
material is available from which to
pick a squad.
The percentage mark for the day
was 77.5, which is a little better than
sharpshooter.
According to secretary Dows, those
interested in shooting will find an ex
cellent opportunity offered by the Club.
Range facilities are ample and rifles
and ammunition are at hand. The ex
penses are negligible, and all men are
eligible for membership.
All hikers are warned that the Rifle
Club shoots every Saturday and fre
