# MAYBE A ROLLS ROYCE

If Walter Christie really deserved that beautiful
Dodge automobile presented by admiring wearers of
the Rig "C" last April 22, and we have no doubt that
he did, Coach Robert Lyman Templeton seems in
line for a new Cadillac.
Christie is a great coach. He has developed a num
ber of wonderful athletes during his twenty-one years
at California. It has been said that he always has his
men in the best of shape, that they are never beaten,
except by better men.
All the tributes which have been paid Christie, true
as they are, serve only to emphasize the accomplish
ment of Stanford's youngest sport mentor on the day
of the Big Meet. Seven different athletes, repre
senting all departments of the track and field, came
through for points which none of the experts would
give them.
A single dope upset may be an individual triumph,
iiut a collective chain of sensational victories, by
men from all parts of the field, indicate the existence
•of some common force capable of bringing the squad
to a point where it could as a whole perform the un
expected. The force is the coach. His stars all won,
and his second place men also won a nice quota of
firsts, indicating either that the general condition of
the Cardinal squad was a trifle better than that of
their rivals, or that a few second-place men had been
developed- to surpass in ability that of their recog
nized competitors.
The contest between Christie and Templeton is not
yet over. Both hope to place high in the East.
Training, form, condition, and confidence m\ist be
developed to a finer point for successful competition
in a large field, than when only the athletes of one
other university are opponents.
Stanford, and the West, as well, will watch with
interest the contest between Walter Christie, recog
nized as one of the greatest western coaches, and
"Dink" Templeton of Stanford.
