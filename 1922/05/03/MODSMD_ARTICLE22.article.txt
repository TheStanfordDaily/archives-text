Cornell is considering a proposition for the insti
tution of a point system to apply to the man or
woman who is engaged in extra curricular activities
of all kinds. The idea is not new, hut while it..is in
use at many secondary schools and some colleges it
has not been given the publicity that the idea merits.
When a student is active in any line of activity out
side of that prescribed by the regular university
course of study he is credited with a certain number
of points earned. The number varies with the in
tensity of the labor spent on the activity, both from
the point of view of effort and time expended. When
a certain number of points have been credited to any
certain man or woman he or she is considered to
have entered enough things and is then ineligible for
further participation.
The idea of the whole system is to keep the stu
dent from getting too deeply involved in things that
will keep him from being successful in his studies.
As it is now, a man goes in for one activity. From
this one he gets in another, and once started, he
thinks that the world is calling him, and he gets in
deeper and deeper till he finds that he is- losing out
in studies, and he doesn't see how he can get out of
all his outside work, lie thinks that he can't grace
fully withdraw but wants to get out so that he can
work on his studies. With the point system he has
no alternative: a committee tells him when he has
achieved the requisite points and then he is simply
made ineligible for the time. This will be a great
help to many men who are unable to cut away them
selves. We look forward with considerable interest
to see how the schcme works out.
