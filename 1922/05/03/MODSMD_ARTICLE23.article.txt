"Don't take things so seriously."
"Gwan, this is my life work," growled the burglar.

CARNIVAL CONTORTION
(No apologies to any one)
What would happen if they threw the follies of Vanity
Fair up in Sally's garret, with Cutie in a coo coo role;
and the burly burlesquers making krazy kat remarks
about who got Gertie's garter, while the entire slave
market slid the glide to a gambling Hell so red hot
that there wasn't a horse show to even water the frosh?
At that, Brick's bear tried to brake the breakers'
bank, and succeeded in turning a dance hall inside out,
though that wasn't quite in vogue at the time, but got
thrown into the crazy house for being abroad in Paris
after midnight; there he had coffee dreams of a balloon
race in which he fell into a sea of cider and attempted to
paddle the frosh ashore by the cartoonists' cave, only
to get Babylon inn bad with the king and queen. All
of which ought to make any ram's head swim.

"Whoosh!" announced Hugo, the midnight moth, dust
ing himself off on the mosquito netting. "I don't blame
Green for staying away from the fight for a while."

Alicia: —May I borrow your pen next hour?
Elijah:—Sure, it's dry anyway.

The Vivacious Press Agent
"Dearest Angela:—Just a line to let you know that
I will call on you again tonight, and that I shall really
be lost without a box of those Glorious Goo Gobs, be
side me in the hammock. You really cannot afford to
be without them, don't you think? They are so refresh
ing, besides helping to destroy the stiff white formality
of evening dress. And lam sure my room-mate, who is
hashing at your house, would appreciate a box now and
then. Sincerely,
FILBERT."

OLD STUFF—NEW STUFFING:
Housewife: —How do you make rutabaga pie?
House-Manager:—Buy a machine.

Love at Second Sight
Was there e'er a guy, with brains so dead.
Who never unto his love hath said:
"Don't simper so, your face is like lead."

Another pipe for the forensic prime minister:
Three hundred famous riders and
horsemen of the west will compete for
$5000 in cash prizes to be offered dur
ing the three-day rodeo, which will be
a part of the Mission Santa Clara cente
nary celebration.
Aurrecoechea is negotiating for a
cowboy race on the first day of the
rodeo, with the various Sheriffs of cen
tral California competing for honors.
There will be other local events on that
.afternoon, including the appearance of
Knox Miller, the "millionaire cowboy,"
a student at Leland Stanford Jr. LTni
versity, who is to compete against the
professional cowboys in several events.
Miller will be accompanied to Santa
Clara by several hundred of his class
mates. Some of the worst outlaw horses
have been reserved for him.
—San Francisco "Chronicle."

Our hero! He will surely make good in the bulldogging
contest, anyway, unless the beast gets him in the re

THE DEMON SUBSCRIPTION AGENT
(He makes $11,985 monthly in his spare time —
You can do the same)
"How do you do, madam. You don't want to die, 1
presume (confident smile). Of course not. But (very
vigorously) do you know that without exercise the brain,
and subsequently the entire human body, would die
within twenty-four hours? That (triumphantly) is an
ambiguous fact.
"Exercise is essential to the head. You may gain a
daily work out, madam —and at a nominal cost only—
by subscribing to the Concachinnator —America's loudest
weekly. Its elongated words have never been equalled
—your jaw will be completely renewed after a short
try at them. Madam (earnestly) you cannot afford to
be without a subscription. Your life depends on it!"

As we were about to leap to press, who should drop
in on us? None other than Launcelot Lump, the lyric
fisherman, who caught the limit on Lagunita the other
day by singing bass to the trout. As usual, he was
all broken up by the fall, but managed to collect him
self. His singing voice and dancing eyes gave him
away—he was feeling good about something. He said
he had the knothole concession in the Roman wall
around the pageant, and was going to clean up; after
which we lacked the nerve to turn him down, so threw
him out after rejecting the following:

AFTERTHOUGHT
(By Launcelot Lump)
The rocks and rills, and laundry bills
Fall on my neck and give me chills
I try to stoke a shot of coke
But lack the dime, for I am broke.
I cannot work, all duties irk
What the heck! I'll be a shirk.
Grand Finale:
I wish, by gosh, I was a squash,
A turnip, or a fried golosh;
I'd choke the bloke, the base deceiver
Who first thought up this here spring fever.

A BLOCKHEAD ISN'T ALWAYS ON THE SQUARE.
