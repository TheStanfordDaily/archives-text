The fighting between troops of
General Chang, Manchurian leader,

continued the Manchang-Peking
front. General Wu yesterday was en
deavoring to crosß the Htai Ho river
about 30 miles south of Peking in
order to gain control of the Peking-
Tientsin railroad. General Chang, ac
cording to reports of the military at
taches, was rushing the greater part
of his 100,000 troops north with great
speed.
Japan sent three torpedo boat de
stroyers from Port Arthur to Tientsin
in order to protect her citizens and
property there. The Japanese Foreign
Office, however, has asserted that the
policy of non-interference in China will
be strictly adhered to and that she

ALLIED NOTE SENT TO RUSSIAN
DELEGATION
Last night the Allies sent a draft
of their proposals to the Russian dele
gation regarding the restriction of, or
compensation for the private property
that Russia has nationalized. Due to
the fact that the French delegation
reserves its final approval until further
instructions are received from Paris
where a conference is being held be
tween Bartgou and Poincare, the note
in itself is almost worthless and af
fords an opportunity for Russia to
offer objections and reject the pro
posals.
