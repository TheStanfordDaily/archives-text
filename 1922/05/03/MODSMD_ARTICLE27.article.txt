Look! ye famous 500, and see what
one of your darling sisters has con
tributed through the Roble Club to the
last issue of the campus daily, thereby
earning the distinction having com
mitted the prize faux pas of the season.
The perpetration occurred last Wednes
day, to-wit: •
ANNOUNCEMENT
"All Roble girls are advised to dine at
Roble tonight because of the English
Department dinner, as ice cream will be
served tonight instead of tomorrow
night."
How about it- We exchange our daily
with dailies all over the country; we're a
member of the P. I. N. S. —but, most of
all, it's our student publication. Being a
university, we are supposed to consist, in
the majority, of grown-up men and
women. Does this look like it? Don't
blame the daily staff; they are required
to print authentic notices as given
them unless radically wrong. No, the
Roble press agent wins the prize. If that
article is not ridiculed in every campus
comic on the coast, it ought to be.
Seriously, such a thing is detrimental
to the viewpoint we're asking the public
to retain regarding our maturity and
judgment. Such a childish, small-town,
back-stage outbreak as that announce
ment getting out into publicity doesn't
help endowment, plans for a graduate
school, or any side of the university and
its purposes.
Of course, brave little Roble defenders,
you can say a freshman wrote it; but
who let it by—or will the poor frosh be
blamed for it? Well, anyway, don't for
get, boys and girls, "ice cream will be
served tonight."
