# U.C. STUDENT WILL TAKE EXAMINATIONS ON WAY TO ORIENT
## 
### 
Honor spirit as promoted under stu
dent self-government at the
of California will extend to the mid-
Pacilic ocean, it became known yester
day when J. Paul St. Sure, member of
the graduating class and a well known
campus journalist, left Berkeley en route
to the Orient as advance agent for the
Glee Club road show. As St. Sure had
to depart before the close of the college
year to insure bookings for the college
singers his examination will be sent to
Honolulu and he then will, on his own
honor, be allowed to take the "finals"
aboard ship on the last lap of his journey.
This is the First time that the honor
spirit at the state university has extended
further than the Berkeley campus. St.
Sure was instrumental in the framing of
the new revised constitution which
merged all student affairs under one or
ganization in an effort to bolster the
honor spirit. He is a Phi Beta Kappa
candidate and a student in law, and will
spend a year at Harvard upon returning
from the Orient.
