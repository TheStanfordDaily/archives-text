# IRISH PROPAGANDA PAPER RECEIVED BY HOOVER COLLECTION
## 
### 
The Hoover War Library at Stan
ford has just received a collection of
interesting, propaganda material from
the Dail Eireann, which was sent for
ward when Arthur Griffith came into
power. This is the first lot of such
material which has reached the cam
pus although efforts to get such ma
terial through began as early as 1918.
This material, which consists of a
practically complete file of the Irish
Bulletin from the end of March, 1921,
to the middle of December of that
year and a large collection of propa
ganda pamphlets and booklets, was
forwarded by Desmond Fitzgerald,
Minister of Publicity of the Dail Ei
reann. Fitzgerald explains in a letter
that is most of propaganda material
has been seized in raids it is impos
sible for him to send Stanford a com
plete collection of documents. He

promised, however, to send as com
plete a collection as possible if later
on the Dail Eireann is able to recover
any of the seized material. In the
same letter he explains that he started
one lost about a year ago, which, how
ever. never reached Stanford and the
directors of the Hoover War Library
had been given to understand that a
set of such material had been sent
about a year before that time.
The Hoover War Library directors
were interested primarily in obtaining
printed material showing the activi
ties of the Irish revolutionists im
mediately following the world war.
The present collection, however, is of
very considerabl historical value. The
Irish Bulletin is a mineographed pub
lication containing information both
of their own activities and plans and
the actions of those opposed to them.
A good many of the printed pamph
lets show indications of having been
carefully read by a considerable num
ber of people before they were trans
mitted to Stanford.
