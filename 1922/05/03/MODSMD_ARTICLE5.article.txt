# ENCINA INTRAMURAL BALI TEAM TO PLAY REDWOOD HIGH NINE
## 
### 
The first trip off the campus by an in
tramural team will be made this after
noon by Encina No. Two, which won the
privilege by an 8 to 3 victory over El
Capitan yesterday. The invitation was
received Monday, and the intramural
authorities decided on a game between
these two organizations, the winner to
meet Redwood High School today. This
school was rather badly defeated by the
Freshman nine early in the season, and
with Taylor on the mound for Encina
No. Two the Stanford men should have
a more than even chance for victory.
Smith and Rowland did battery work for
the winners in yesterday's game, with
Lindersmith and Fehren on duty for El
Capitan.
Beta Theta Pi played a good game
with Phi Kappa Sigma, the final count
standing at 6 to 1 in favor of the former.
The teams were deadlocked at 1 all until
the fourth inning, when Beta Theta Pi
solved Moore's delivery and staged a
rally with two men out. Singles, com
bined with Hamilton's home run and
Mertz's three-base blow, brought in three
runs, and two more came in during chap
ter six. An unusual break went against
Phi Kappa Sigma when the ball became
caught in Greglow's mask, allowing Ala
baster a two-base steal before it could
be brought back into play. Reed pitched
a good game for Beta Theta Pi, allow
ing only three hits; and Mertz caught.
Sigma Chi held on to their perfect
average by running up an 8 to 3 win
over El Campo, without the aid of their
regular pitcher, Fox. McConnell held
his opponents safely at all times, and the
slugging Sigma Chi team piled up a lead
early in the game, which was never
threatened. Dallas did the receiving for
the winners, with Deben and Holmes as
the El Campo battery.
El Cuadro had little trouble in sub
duing Theta Chi by a count of 9 to 1.
Errors by Theta Chi were responsible
for most of the scores, though the El
Cuadro batsmen kept Barnard in hot
water most of the time. Franklin was
on the receiving end for Theta Chi, and
Robison and Seymour made up the El
Cuadro battery.
The Alpha Delta Phi-Delta Upsilon
game was postponed until Friday, May 5.
