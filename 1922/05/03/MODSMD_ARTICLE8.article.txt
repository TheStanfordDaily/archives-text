# TWENTY-FIVE PIECE ORCHESTRA WILL FURNISH PAGEANT MUSIC
## Miss Edith Pasmore, Warren Allen Taking Charge of Accompaniment 
### 
A complete orchestra of twenty-five pieces will furnish the music for
the dances and pantomime of the Women's Spring Pageant. The majority
of the musicians are members of the University Orchestra, bbt several pro
fessionals are also being secured. The musical selections were chosen by Miss
Edith Pasmore, who is directing the dances, considered as being the best
adapted to the action and spirit of the various numbers.
Warren D. Allen, University Organist, has arranged the music to form

a continuous accompaniment for the
pageant. Since orchestral scores for
several of the compositions were not
available, Allen orchestrated these se
lections himself.
With the exception of two violin
solos, the entire orchestra will play
during the presentation of the pageant.
Miss Margaret Fallenius will play the
"Liebesfreud" by Kreisler, for Oe
tavia's dance in which she tries to at
tract the attention of Varrius and win
him back from her rival Randalin.
Elizabeth Pierce will give the Humo
resque by Tor Aulin, when Randalin
and Varrius dance in their fantastic
love scene.
The pageant opens with a sacrificial
dance to the goddess Freya by the
druids, the priestesses of ancient Bri
tain. The mystic and religious spirit
of this rite is interpreted from Saint-
Saens' "Romance Without Words.*'
Randalin, the Britain heroine, follows
the druids and makes her offering to
the goddess Avhile the music of
Brahm's waltz in A flat is played.
Randalin's maidens dance to the ballet
music from the opera Faust. The
Britain villagers romp through their
folk daifee to the three dances from
the music of "Henry VIII" by Edward
German.
The bandstand has been turned to
face the out-door stage, which has
been constructed on the lake bank.
Both the bandstand and the water
act as resonators and make the acoust
ic properties of the place unusually
clear.
Octavia, the jealous Roman, works
herself into a rage when she is scorn
ed by Varrius, dancing to the agitato
of the Finale from Tschaikowsky's
Fourth Symphony. The Roman Cym
bal dancers clash and clang their
brass cymbals in the rhythm of La
Cinquantaine by Gabriel Marie. The
ballet music from Orpheus furnishes
the accompaniment to the graceful


Foresta Hodgson, '24, and
Margaret Bailie, '24, who as
Randalin, a Britain maiden,
and Varrius, a Roman sol
dier, have leading parts in
the Spring Pageant.
