"TRY THE DRUG STORE FIRST"
COMFORT FOR YOUR
FEET
No more foot troubles.
Warm weather means continual discom
fort from tired, aching feet. There is no
need for you to suffer any of these dis
comforts.
Try a can of
Rexall Foot Powder
Sprinkle a small amount into each shoe
and sock, and immediately you will feel
the soothing, cooling effect. It is in
sprinkler top cans and easy to use.
When bathing the feet, use
Rexall Foot Bath Tablets
which will add still further to your foot
comfort.
If corns trouble, use First-Aid Corn
Plasters, and Rexall Corn Solvent.
