# LEGAL FRATERNITIES CLASH IN CONTRACT ARGUMENT TONIGHT
## Phi Alpha Delta Will Try to Hold Client of Phi Delta Phi For Large Money Sum 
### 
Tonight in the Little Theater, at
7:30, the defendant, who is trying to
secure release from a contract to pur
chase a hardware store and home from
a Palo Alto merchant, will hear his
case fully argued by representatives
of Phi Delta Phi and Phi Alptya Delta
law fraternities, in the first annual
legal clash of the two organizations.
The contest, this year conceived and
worked out by the two professional
groups, is modeled somewhat after the
nationally famous Ames Debate of
Harvard, which has become cne of the
best known traditions at Cambridge.
For the plaintiff, A. R. Scott, '19,
and H. G. Shepherd, '18, will try to
make the contract stick. The hard
ware establishment and home were
offered together, assert these bar
risters, and these is nothing for the
defendant to do but produce the pur
chase price.
The defendant's council, however,
has thirty-five pages of brief, suggest
ing to the court any number of things
the defendant may do other than pay
ing the purchase price. B. C. Wohl
ford, '18, and T. E. Bowen, '23, for
Phi Delta Phi, have drawn up the
proposition for the defense. Judge
John T. Nourse, District Attorney
Schwartz, and Attorney H. R. Bell, will
act as the court In decreeing the final
fate of the parties.
Shepherd is reputed to be one of
the best students in the Law school.
Scott, a recent transfer, is said to be
fully able to handle his share of the
plaintiff's argument. Wohlford Is a
mature student, with a background of
legal study at both Harvard and Stan
ford. The youngest member of the
quartet is Bowen, a junior, who lias
had considerable speaking experience.
Professor C. B. Whittier drew up the
three-page statement of facts which
produced all the defendant's difficul
ties. Both arrays of talent have been
working on the facts for several weeks.
Each has prepared a full length brief,
fully stating the argument to be pre
sented. These briefs have been ex
changed, and have been placed in the
hands of the judges, to insure that the
argument will present a class from
beginning to the end of the case.
