# ENCINA INTRAMURAL TEAM DEFATED BY REDWOOD CITY HIGH
## 
### 
Encina's intramural baseball team
failed in an attempt at off-campus or
ganized competition, and returned to the
Farm last evening after a 9 to 5 defeat
from Redwood City High School. The
Stanford men put up a good struggle,
howeVer, and saved themselves from a
shut-out by ateÂ« national rally in the
last three innings.
Hal Smith took the mound for Encina
and held it through the game, with Row
land as his battery-mate. Smith, though
tired from yesterday's match with El
Capitan, twirled well for nine innings
and allowed the high school boys only
nine hits. The hits came in the pinches,
and for Encina, defensive was none too
steady. Allain, pitching for Redwood,
gave up eight safe blows to the Encina
aggregation and whiffed four of them.
Smith caused six high schoolers to
strike out.
Going into the seventh inning with
the score 8 to 0 against them, Encina,
with the help of Rodriguez's two-bag
ger, put over three runs. Two more
were added in the ninth, but Redwood
had the game sewed up and amassed a
useless counter in the eighth frame.
With the exception of Rodriguez,
Scherer of Redwood, with another
double, was the only man to connect
for more than one base. Allain and
Scherer made up the Redwood High
School battery.
The regular schedule is resumed this
afternoon between Phi Delta Theta and
Delta Chi; Encina and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon; Sigma Nu and El Toro; Kap
pa Sigma and Theta Delta Chi; Delta
Tau Delta and Zeta Psi.
