# Pageant Will Offer Great Range Of Parts For Individual Talent And Group Character Portrayal
## 
### 
Opportunity for individual character
work as well as skill in solo and en
semble dancing is provided in the Wo
men's Spring Pageant, which will be
presented at the lake on next Saturday
afternoon. The cast calls for a variety
of character parts and the women tak
ing the leading roles have attempted to
make these both realistic and individual.
Foresta Hodgson, '24, as Randalin,
the niece of Vortiger and the idol of the
Britains, is a gracious and unassuming
maiden who first appears in a dance
in which she does homage to the god
dess Freya. She gives a pantomime of
gathering sheaves of grain as symbolic
of Freya, who is the deity of spring
time and agriculture. Miss Hodgson
dances with unaffected grace and
rhythm which correspond with her char
acter of the Britain, princess of the
olden days. Her dances are seemingly
simple and spontaneous. In her duet
with Varrius, who is making love to
her, she is shy but not coquettish, as
her rival Octavia would have been.
Octavia is played by Helen Whitney,
'24, who easily assumes the role of the
jealous, high-tempered Roman girl who
sees herself scorned by her former
lover, Varrius. She always retains the
poise and command of the situation
which is to be expected from the cul
tured Roman of her time. Finding that
she is unsuccessful in winning back
Varrius, she flics into a rage. This
tantrum dance is particularly difficult
and Miss Whitney enters into it with
vigor and well-simulated fury. Even
at the end, when the betrothal of Ran
dalin and Varrius is celebrated, the Ro
man girl retains her pride and marches
scornfully past the festive throng.
In the character of Varrius, the hero
of the story, Margaret Bailie, '24, has
perhaps the most difficult role of all.
Varrius is the Roman lieutenant who
forgets his love for Octavia when he
sees Randalin, the fair Britain. Miss
Bailie fits in with the character natural
ly and seems to be a typical Roman
soldier in his glory of armor and plumed
helmet.
The corresponding parts of the Ro
man governor and of the Britain chief
tain are taken by Mary Learnard, '23,
