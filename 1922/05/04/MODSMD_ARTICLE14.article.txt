# FOUR GRID GAMES TO BE PLAYED IN STADIUM SATURDAY
## 
### 
football Coaches Glenn Warner and
Claude Thornhill will use every one of
the hundred or more prospective candi
dates for the 1922 Stanford Varsity who
have been participating in an extensive
four weeks' spring practice, in the grid
games scheduled to take place in the
Stanford Stadium next Saturday after
noon.
Two fresh teams will take the field
at the beginning of each quarter.
In the selection of the eight elevens,
Warner is trying as far as possible to
even up the material so that each of the
contests will prove interesting. The
quarters will be of from ten to fifteen
minutes' duration, and some of the
simpler Warner formations will be used.
Among the varsity men who will ap
pear in the lineups are: Captain-elect
Dudley DeGroot, Campbell, Doughty,
Douglas, Faville, Ludeke, Mertz, and
Wilcox. Among the stars on last year's
freshman squad who will compete are
Cuddeback, Dole, Gilliland, Hoffman,
Houck, Howard, Janssen, Johnson, D.
Lawson, J. Lawson, Middleton, Ship
key, Van Hook, and Wheat.
Immediately after the games are over,
Coach Glenn Warner will depart for the
East.
