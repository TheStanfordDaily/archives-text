COLORADO AGRICULTURAL
COLLEGE. (P. I. N. S.)—"Hey, Skin
ney, hurry up—here comes the pee-rade
—Hooray!"
A street parade featuring a clown
band and other attractions in the
morning, the big main show and the
many sideshows and concessions going
full blast in the afternoon, and a big
jitney dance in the large horse barn
climaxing the whole affair are the hints
of the latest plans for College Day cel
abration, Friday, May 5, at which time
all students will be excused from
classes to have the time of their lives.
The features of the main show, to
which activity tickets will gain admis
sion, will be the bucking contests and a
brigade of real clowns who will see
that no frowns are allowed to live.
There is to be a certain little mule noted
for its disposition who will entertain
those who wish aviation thrills. A five
dollar prize is in store for the person
who rides the mule successfully.
