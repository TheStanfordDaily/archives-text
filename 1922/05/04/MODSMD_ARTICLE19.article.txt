# UTAH PAPER PRAISES STANFORD TRADITION AND SPORTMANSHIP
## 
### 
In a reccnt issue of "Student Life,"
the official newspaper organ of the Utah
Agricultural College, there appeared an
editorial relative to Stanford sportsman
ship and the traditional "hello." The
author, Wilford D. Porter, was one of
the delegates at the annual convention
of the Western Intercollegiate Press
Association recently held at Stanford.
His editorial reads as follows:
"On entering the campus of Leland
Stanford Jr. University, one is imme
diately greeted with the famous pass
word, "Hello." This brief recognition
is a tradition at this institution, which
means, 'If you're one of us I should
know you, or if you are not one of us, I
want to know you.' There is a psycho
logical influence which is carried about
by this simple work which seems to
break the ice which overhangs a strange
place and makes one feel that he is on
the level with those at home.
"At Berkeley and at Stanford, the
highest type of sportsmanship is prac
ticed. At track meets, tennis matches,
baseball games, and other forms of ath
letic contests, the opposing team is
cheered and applauded almost as heart
ily as the home boys. No insults of any
kind are meted out to the visitors and
this practice alone places the contests
on a high plane and takes away the
sting which is often given from the side
lines. The day of the gang fight is past
and in its stead is coming the hand
shake after the game is over."
