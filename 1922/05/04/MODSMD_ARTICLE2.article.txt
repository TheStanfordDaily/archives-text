# UNIVERSITY CARRYING ON IMPROVEMENT WORK
## 
### 
Sufficient water for irrigation during
the summer months will bS provided by
a six-inch pipe line which is being con
structed by the University in the vicin
ity of north Lasuen. The line runs
along the alley back of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house and through the field
below the Phi Kappa Psi house, con
necting with the pipes on the San Juan
hill. In past years tlowers and plants
on the hill have died during summer
on account of lack of irrigation water
provided by the one-inch main. The
additional supply of water will also
give better fire protection to houses
in this vicinity.
The room formerly occupied by the
Stanford Union cafe is being altered
and will soon be used by an all-day
and all-night "beanery," which will be
under the direction of the Union board
of governors. An areaway will bring
food from the kitchens of the new
Union. At present workmen are tear
ing out the bulkheads of the room and
another entrance is being put in so that
patrons may enter the lunch-room from
the rear of the building.
The steam line to the basketball pa
vilion is almost finished. In order to
beautify the surroundings of the struc
ture, pines and cedars have been plant
ed. Hy University Day. May 20, the
driveways leading to the pavilion will
probably be completed.
