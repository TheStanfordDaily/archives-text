# ONE REASON WHY
## 
### 
At this time last year the Daily Palo Alto was
pointing out the unreasonable working of the Stan
ford probation system, which at that time had ceased
to operate in behalf of the cause for which it was
designed, that of improving scholarship; and which
served only to handicap by its penalty element those
students who were participants in athletics and activ
ity, in preference to students who spent their time
in dancing and foolishness.
The faculty committee looking into the penalty sys
tem of probation which would not allow a student
just below the line to compete in any sport, found
at once that the system was doing harm rather than
good, and the penalty element was removed last
spring just too late to be included among the news of
the last issue of the Daily.
The feat of tieing the University of California at
65 1-2 points could not have been accomplished with
the penalty element in force. Several capable ath
letes, on probation the winter quarter, did good work
and made up a number of honor points during this
period, but by the technical penalty provision they
would still have been unable to compete with the team
in the spring. They would be none the less better
scholars had they been denied the privilege of enter
ing the meet, and the whole of Stanford University
would have been the loser for their absence.
The very reasonable attitude of the faculty com
mittee in recommending the abolition of the pnealty
provision which had become obsolete, must be re
membered along with other reasons for a good
showing this spring. It denotes at least two things:
that the Stanford faculty is willing and reasonable
to listen to students and even to agree with them and
act on their joint conclusions when the students have
actually some real dope on their side. And it indi
cates that Stanford will no longer be set back by this
additional handicap which none of our competitors
has been forced to meet in intercollegiate competi
tion. It means that dancing and various other activi
ties ranging from Woodside to Tait's on the Beach
are no longer favored over athletic enterprise. It
means also, we believe, that scholarship will benefit
as well as athletics.
