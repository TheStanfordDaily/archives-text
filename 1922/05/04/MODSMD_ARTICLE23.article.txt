# A 						PERSONAL HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
A student of the University of California will take
his end semester examinations on the way to China
after he has left the University and is absolutely out
on his own. This is a test of the recent California
honor system which brings out that the honor system
does not only work in the confines of the college but
can extend to conduct in any place where the honor
trained man may go. Although the man who is
being trusted with taking his examinations away
from even the eyes of his classmates and friends is
a Phi Reta Kappa, and so, presumably an excellent
scholar, he is doing more to further the system
than any number of his mates will do in classes
where the eyes of many take the place of the proctor
who has been done away with.
Here we are having the spirit of the system broad
ened all the time with the allowing of more laxity as
to place where examinations may be taken. In many
courses examinations can be written now on the
typewriter, and no special place is assigned for the
use of the machine. This is making it about as
easy for the student as is possible and at the same
time is helping the instructors when it comes to
correcting the papers because the typewriter print is
a big improvement on ordinary longhand any day.
This movement to put the taking of the final exami
nation wholly in the hands of the student is doing

away with the formal characteristics which have
marked the time of finals for one of dread. It
is the modern thing that we are working for, the
time when we can give an informal resume of what
we know about the course after we have finished
it. The formality of the stiff classroom and the
narrow set of questions may l>e looked upon as on
the way to a not too distant finish.
