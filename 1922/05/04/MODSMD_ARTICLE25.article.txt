The Sophomore Scud is Saturday night. If you like
to Scud, leave your Weed chains home and get going.
However, if you dislike the word Scud, and prefer to
Hop, come anyway. It is rumored that Pogo Sticks
will be furnished those who Hop. There will be no
opium, please. As for those who crave to Snake, we
can promise nothing, less they bring their own birds.
For them what Crawls instead of Scuds, the best Crawl
ing accommodations in the state will be provided. B.
V. D. will caption these programs. —Advt.
• • •
Speaking of Scuds, a handsome paraffin cigarette
hojder will be presented the man offering the definition
that comes nearest to the true spirit of the word, if it
has a spirit.
• * •
Would a course in Applied Plumbing be a pipe course?
As the convict remarked, this is sure the rocks.
• • •
Are you ticklish.
No —Jewish.
♦ * *
Just because the conductor works ten hours a day
doesn't mean that he has a mean line.
• • *
The track team will now gt> East in an Endeavor to
raise enough money to pay for the Carnival.
• * •
Visitor—What's the name of this blankety-blank
double-x town?
Native—Mister, that's it.
* * *
Teacher: James, why do we celebrate Washington's
Birthday?
James: 'Cause there ain't no school that day.
• • *
"Yes," wrote home young J. Hall, '25, "I'm glad I come
to Stanford. Our family is pretty well-known here, in
fact they has named a big dormittory after cousin
Encina."
• » *
"Every man should be able to stand alone." Come
around the first of the month, before house-bills are
out, and you'll stand a better chance.
» * *
The toothless old alumni still tell about the frosh
class that decorated for a jolly-up in poison ivy.
* * *
We are requested by the frosh class to deny the
report that the unexpected protraction of the baseball
fight was due to the inability of a certain frosh to get
the ball out of his mouth. The frosh in question, it is
stated, had the mumps.
• * *
No, Heloise, they don't call a fly-catching plant a
fielder.
* * *
After the tremendous inrush of contributions result
ing from the first installment of Cabbages' Course in
Campus Humor, we hesitate to face such another.
However, we feel it our duty to persevere, no matter
what anxiety it may bring the insurance companies.
Herewith the second installment.
Rule No. 4 —lf you must fill up the column, and all
other sources fail, try a little l'ree verse.
* « •
Any free verse gets by, provided, 1: —That it has no
point; 2: That, under no circumstances does it contain
any words that rhyme; 3: That it strings out far
enough. For Example, take the following:
The placard
On the instructor's
Desk said
"Retain
Papers until
After lecture."
Well,
I did.
I kept mine
For a
Whole
Quarter after
That lecture.
I'm Sorry.
• * *
Is there any point to that? Does it rhyme? Is it strung
out? Did it get printed? Draw your own conclusions.
♦ * *
There was a young man named LeFevre,
Who heartily laughed at hay fever.
But he came to a pass
Where he had to eat grass
And he sliced off his nose with a cleaver.
* * *
"This hurtes me worse than it does you," lied the
small boy's father.
"If it doesn't now," mused the small boy, "It will as
soon as you hit that tack in my pocket."
♦ * *
Geography Teacher: And where is the Red Sea?
Stupid by Observing Student: Generally at the top of
the paper.
* m m
The best pageant advertising is this free rehearsals
idea. It may not be so favorable but it will sell the
seats.
• * *
The guy that wanted to know "What's in a Name?"
should be there tomorrow. He'll find where all the
grace in the pageant is.

The Sophomore Scud is Saturday night. If you like
to Scud, leave your Weed chains home and get going.
However, if you dislike the word Scud, and prefer to
Hop, come anyway. It is rumored that Pogo Sticks
will be furnished those who Hop. There will be no
opium, please. As for those who crave to Snake, we
can promise nothing, less they bring their own birds.
For them what Crawls instead of Scuds, the best Crawl
ing accommodations in the state will be provided. B.
V. D. will caption these programs. —Advt.

Speaking of Scuds, a handsome paraffin cigarette
hojder will be presented the man offering the definition
that comes nearest to the true spirit of the word, if it
has a spirit.

Would a course in Applied Plumbing be a pipe course?
As the convict remarked, this is sure the rocks.

No —Jewish.

Just because the conductor works ten hours a day
doesn't mean that he has a mean line.

After the tremendous inrush of contributions result

Any free verse gets by, provided, 1: —That it has no
