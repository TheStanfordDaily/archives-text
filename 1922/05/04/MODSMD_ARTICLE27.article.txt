IN IRELAND
The elusive prospect of peace in
Ireland was again approached when
the deValera faction and the Free
State faction in the Bail voted a truce
between the Free State and the Repub
lican Armies. DeValera sent couriers
to announce the decision to his follow
ers. The agreement was reached fol
lowing the news of a bloody encounter
between Free State and Republican
forces in which the extremists were
ousted from Kilkenny Castle. The
tragedy of intransigeancy ill Ireland
now awaits another turn. What if an
irreconcilable faction of the Republi
cans should refuse to observe the De
Valera truce? A nation that tries to
govern itself, and does not know how
to make compromises has a hard road
to travel.
AT GENOA
News from Genoa continues to cen
ter around the Russian negotiations.
The project now before the Russian
delegation is apparently unsatisfactory
to the French and Belgians as well
as to the Russians. The French insist
upon some guarantee for private prop
erty in Russia; the Russians note the
absence of any provision for a loan to
Russia, or even for her de jure recog
nition, and are unwilling to make the
concessions demanded of the Commu
nist theory and the sovereignty of
Russia. Tchicherin appealed for
"economic co-operation between two
worlds"; his phrases call attention to
a sinister attitude that has character
ized the attitude of all powers toward
Russia since 1917, and which still
haunts the Genoa Conference, though
none dare to urge it is a diplomatic
argument. For Russia and Western
Europe are two worlds within a single
continent, and Europe does not want
Russia to succeed. Regardless of
whether the debts, pre-war and post
war, are paid, and regardless of wheth
er propaganda be suppressed or vigor
ously conducted —regardless even of
the political alignments the Russian
State may choose to make —the con
spicuous and permanent success of
Communism in Russia would shake
every country in the world with revo
lution. This is a fact that 110 agree
ment can alter.
