# Chemistry Department Starts Fund For Appointment Office
## 
### 
"To do its best work," says Mrs.
Elizabeth Snell, appointment secre
tary, "the appointment office should
really become a vocational bureau that
will help every student select the
branch of work most suited to him
and which will help him secure a po
sition as soon aB he graduates."
Realizing that to make this a prac

tical success necessitates an increase
in office equipment and personnel,
members of the Chemistry Department
are formulating a plan for raising the
funds required to meet the expense of
such an addition. The chemists nre
taking the initiative in this drive with
the hope that the whole student body
will soon take it over.
Mrs. Snell's plan is to have a record
kept in some one place in the uni
versity, as is now done at Dartmouth,
which will show what work each stu
dent has done since he entered col
lege, how he has done it, what his
special interests are, his health, men
tal alertness, and anything else rela
tive to his fitness for a particular job.
Another part of her plan is to send
out circular questionnaires to all
alumni. These will ask for any in
formation each alumnus may have
regarding positions in his own or other
kinds of work. The office will then
have a much wider field of placement
for graduates of the university.
Harvard and Yale have similar sys
tems that have given remarkable re
sults in securing positions for their
respective graduates. Their success
is due to the support of the alumni in
response to the efforts of the appoint
ment offices.
