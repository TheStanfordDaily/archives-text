# VARIED PROGRAM IS GIVEN AT BANQUET OF ASILOMAR CLUB
## 
### 
A program of unusually wide range
was presented at the first banquet of
the Asilomar Club which was held last
night in the New Union.
James Knappen, '23, president of
the Stanford "Y", was the first speaker
introduced by Junior Collins, '24, toast
master. Knappen spoke briefly on the
"Meaning of the Asilomar Club."
David Harris, *23, followed with a eu
logy and a satire on "Women." Mari
on Potter, *22, speaking for the women,
replied with "The Stanford Man." A
darky impersonation by John Weight
man '23, and "Humorous Slants on
Life," by Gordon Ira, '22, were other
numbers. The program was concluded
by Fred Shipp, '20, who spoke on the
subject "Realizing our Possibilities."
The Asilomar Club, organized last
January, is composed of Stanford men
who have been delegates to the Asilo
mar Conferences for the Pacific toast
Colleges, held annually during the
Christmas vacation.
The purpose of the Asilomar Club,
according to Knappen, is to keep alive
the friendships made at these confer
ences, to interest others in going to
Asilomar, and to support as an or
ganized body campus programs and
movements that are in accord with
the spirit and purposes of the Asilomar
Conferences.
