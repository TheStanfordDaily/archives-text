# Will Close Accounts of Wilson Foundation Here
## 
### 
Professor Jefferson Elmore, of the
Latin department, who is chairman
of the committee representing the
Woodrow Wilson Foundation here,
will close his accounts next Monday
and forward the contributions to New
York.
Despite the fact that there has been
no drive or active solicitation on the
campus, a number of voluntary sub
scriptions have been received, mostly

from members of the faculty. The
income from the amount raised in the
United States will total $1,000,000, and
will be awarded as prizes to those who
do the most for democracy and justice
in the world. These awards will bear
the name of the former president.
