# MOST OF ACTION IN 1923 OPERA TO BE "UP ON A LADDER"
## Effective Setting Arranged For Coming Number From Which Play Gets Its Name 
### 
Edythe Baylis, '24, is "Up On a Lad
der" when the curtain rises upon the
first act of the Junior Opera, and it is
from that position that she sets about
to reform her lover's tendencies toward
releasing others from their predicaments.
The more she tries, the higher she as
cends, and not until the final untangling
with which all operas must end, does
she set both feet upon firm ground.
There she is held by Bill, who, after
two acts of being everybody's property
but his own, finally asserts his rights.
Bill is played by Dick Pershing, '22.
"Up On a Ladder" is the theme song
from which the opera takes its name
and will open and close the acts. Ed
Farmer, '23, has designed an iris for
the opening, with Miss Baylis as its
center. As the iris widens, the colorful
dancers of the ballet school, where the
scenes are laid, gather around her and
sing C. W. Midgley's song, and she re
sponds from her heights with Dick Mal
aby's "Hello."
The part which the choruses play in
the action of "Up On a Ladder" will
provide a continuity unusual in produc
tions of the kind. All the elements of
a revue have been taken out of the
show, and each appearance of the
chorus arid all the musical numbers will
work logically into the plot.
The authors, Rosemary Drachman,
'22, and Tom Kleckner, '18, have pro
vided a setting which provides for the
use of brilliant and effective costumes
for the dancers. Other than that,
Coach Lester Scib, '22, is placing em
phasis upon simplicity in effects. For
the most part, the characters will wear
appropriate campus clothes.
The opening act will be put together
for the irst time tonight. While Seib
has been training the choruses in new
and intricate songs, Coach Gordon
Davis has been handling the rehearsals
of the characters, in order that there be
no time lost in training the unusually
large cast.
