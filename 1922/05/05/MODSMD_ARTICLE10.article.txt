# Temperamental Old Men Give Contrast To Youth In Show
## 
### 
Three old men—of distinctly different
types—offer strong contrast to the
abundance of enthusiastic youth with
which "Up On a Ladder," the 1923
opera, will he tilled.
These men have been supplied with
more temperament than a whole galaxy
of prima donnas. Arnold Bayley, '23, is
the excitable Mr. Boukouski, owner of a
ballet, and incidentally father of the two
pretty girls who bring about unpleasant
mixups. Warren Lewis, '20, is the jovial
Scotchman, with his perpetual burr and
his singing of "Roamin' in the Gloamin* "
on all occasions. The trio is completed
by Stoddard Atwood, the mentally un
balanced Russian dancing master, who
has impressive poetry on his tongue's end
to meet any situation.
One of the most effective bits in the
show is the refrain "There Is No Age,"
sung by these three men, while the
younger characters come in with a fast
and rollicking counter melody. The
number was written by Richard Mala
by, '23.
