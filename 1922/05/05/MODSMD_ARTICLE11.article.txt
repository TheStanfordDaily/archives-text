# GRID PRACTICE ENDS WITH GAME TOMORROW
## Eight Evenly Matched Teams To Compete in Last Bout Before Warner Starts East 
### 
Football teams will clash in the Stan
ford stadium tomorrow for the first time
since the Big Game of last November,
when eight teams, made up of the spring
football candidates, come together for
short games of fifteen minutes each.
Coach Warner has selected the teams
and has made them as nearly even as
possible. They will take the field two
at a time, and play one quarter, after
which two new teams will lie used. Thus
the spectators are assured of several in
teresting contests.
Each team wjll be thoroughly aware of
the tactics of the other team, as the sig
nals and plays are the same for all
teams. No very complicated plays will
be used, as most of the efforts of Warner
and Thornhill have been directed to
coaching the men in the correct methods
of tackling, running, and such other de
tails that go to make a smooth-working
machine.
Several new men have been turning
out for practice each night of this last
week, due to their release from other
athletic activities. Over one hundred
names now appear on the roll book.
The games will begin at 2 p. m. so
that spectators may go to the Pageant,
which starts at 4.
Coach Warner is leaving for the east
immediately after the Saturday con
tests. He will proceed to his home and
remain there until commencement of
autumn practice at the University »112
Pittsburgh, in September, where he will
have charge for two more years.
