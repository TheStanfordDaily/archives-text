# PRESIDENT WILBUR DESCRIBES FUTURE STANFORD CAMPUS
## Plans For Residence Units; Sites For New Building Discussed at Assembly 
### 
Stanford as a growing and a living
tiling, is the picture which Dr. Wilbur
presented to the students at an Assembly
held this morning. "The Stanford pro
gram for the future is a great and stim
ulating one," characterized the Presi
dent's conclusion of his outline of the
University's present and future activities.
"Over $800,000 of the first million for
the endowment fund is already contrib
uted," said Dr. Wilbur in speaking of
the progress of the campaign. All of
this lias been contributed by alumni and
students in California, and a complete
report is not yet at hand. It is expected
that some $900,000 will be raised here
and that the sum will be well into the
second million before there is any appeal
to the public at large.
"Our problem has been to re-introduce
the alumni to the University's real finan
cial situation,'' continued Dr. Wilbur.
"Student contributions have acted as a
guide and incentive for them." The sec
ond million, which is to go toward build
ing purposes, will not come from Stan
ford men and women directly but from
outside people who may be interested in
the project.
Jii discussing the building plans of
the University, Dr. Wilbur used slides
of the grounds and of the proposed
structures. According to his report
there is a 1500-acre tract of flat land
which can be used for building purposes.
The present plans provide for residence
units for men, new Biology and Law
buildings and a women's gymnasium.
The present sum will provide for a
dining hall for Encina Hall and one resi
dence unit to accommodate 120 men.
Four such groups will be necessary to
take care of the present enrollment of
men students and until that is accom
plished no steps will be taken to change
