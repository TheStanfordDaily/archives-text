# PRESIDENT WILBUR DESCRIBES FUTURE STANFORD CAMPUS
## Plans For Residence Units; Sites For New Building Discussed at Assembly 
### 
Stanford as a growing and a living
tiling, is the picture which Dr. Wilbur
presented to the students at an Assembly
held this morning. "The Stanford pro
gram for the future is a great and stim
ulating one," characterized the Presi
dent's conclusion of his outline of the
University's present and future activities.
"Over $800,000 of the first million for
the endowment fund is already contrib
uted," said Dr. Wilbur in speaking of
the progress of the campaign. All of
this lias been contributed by alumni and
students in California, and a complete
report is not yet at hand. It is expected
that some $900,000 will be raised here
and that the sum will be well into the
second million before there is any appeal
to the public at large.
"Our problem has been to re-introduce
the alumni to the University's real finan
cial situation,'' continued Dr. Wilbur.
"Student contributions have acted as a
guide and incentive for them." The sec
ond million, which is to go toward build
ing purposes, will not come from Stan
ford men and women directly but from
outside people who may be interested in
the project.
Jii discussing the building plans of
the University, Dr. Wilbur used slides
of the grounds and of the proposed
structures. According to his report
there is a 1500-acre tract of flat land
which can be used for building purposes.
The present plans provide for residence
units for men, new Biology and Law
buildings and a women's gymnasium.
The present sum will provide for a
dining hall for Encina Hall and one resi
dence unit to accommodate 120 men.
Four such groups will be necessary to
take care of the present enrollment of
men students and until that is accom
plished no steps will be taken to change
the fraternity house living arrangements.
The proposed residence units are based
on the types of dormitories at Oxford
and Cambridge, and will be constructed
on the same general type of architecture
as the new Union. There will be a com
mon kitchen for four dining halls, each
accommodating thirty men. An assem
bly hall for entertaining purposes will
occupy a central position and two wings
from a central corridor will contain the
living quarters. The plan is for a two
| two system with a common study room
adjoining a sleeping porch and a dressing
room. The proposed plan is exceedingly
elastic, said Dr. Wilbur, so that any
needed changes may be easily made.
"It is hoped that we can take all of
the Freshmen ,into Encina Hall when
the unit is completed in order that they
may develop a better class and univer
sity spirit before they are scattered about
the campus," said Dr. Wilbur. "By the
use of a number of types of living quar
ters the men will have sufficient chance
to choose the one they prefer. As the
building progresses we also hope to turn
over the second floor of the new Union
to the various organizations to make it
a real center of activities."
In visualizing the campus with the
proposed buildings a reality. Dr. Wilbur
placed the new Law building in the pres
ent location of the Inn, the Biology
building near the Chemistry department,
and specified a connection between the
Mining and Geology departments for the
Branner Library.
Dr. Wilbur showed slides of the build
ings at the Hopkins Marine Station at
Monterey and spoke of that department
as one of the most valuable assets of the
University. A series of buildings will
be constructed on China Point which
overlooks a coast line of about a half
mile owned by the University. At pres
ent the authorities are seeking a special
endowment for the station and it is
hoped that it will become the center of
biological study on the Pacific coast.
"Our biggest appeal to the public for
the endowment fund will come in the
third million, which will go to the Medi
cal School in San Francisco," said Dr.
Wilbur. He outlined the enormous
amount of public service this department
is giving and illustrated his description
of the buildings and equipment by slides.
It is the plan of the endowment commit
tee to appeal to the people of San Fran
cisco and from different foundations for
the third million.
"We have a right to look ahead to the
future development of Stanford," con
cluded Dr. Wilbur, as he sketched a
campus which will have a series of quad
rangles extending to the highway and
fringed with residence halls. "We have
an ideal location for one of the great in
stitutions of the world, an ideal plan,
and a wonderful start."
