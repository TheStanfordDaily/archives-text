## 
### 
The big offering of the women of the campus will
he tomorrow when the Spring Pageant is presented
on the shore of Lagunita. The Pageant, portraying
the life of the time when the Romans conquered
Britain, has been worked out by the women of the
University in the utmost detail and after hard work
by all the heads of the women's activities and the
several score women represented in the show.
1 his is something which is put on by a one hundred
per cent feminine organization. But it is not for the
benefit of any women's part of the University. The
benefit is to go to the endowment fund. Aside from
any interest that we take in the performance from the
standpoint of supporting the endeavors of the women
we have in front of us the worthy cause of the en
dowment, the thing toward which our energy has
been turned for the past several months.
From the viewpoint of just the student we can
look at the Pageant as a performance where we can
do two things at once: support the women and the
endowment. On the side of the men we are recipro
cating in a measure for the help that we expect and
get from the women for our athletic enterprises in
functions such as the Carnival.
