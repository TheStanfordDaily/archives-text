# A
						SIDE LIGHT FOR THE FALL
## 
### 
Eight football teams will perform tomorrow aft
ernoon in the Stadium. They have been working
together for four days and so should show something
more than a ragged pickup exhibition. Nothing spec
tacular will be pulled, but the whole squad which has
been working this spring may be seen in action at this
time. All men who have been out steadily will be
worked in the four quarters of the game, and all
will be given a chance to do their stuff.
This is the one time when the campus will have a
chance to see Glenn Warner out on the field with his
team because the practice closes tomorrow for the
spring, and Warner will not be here in the fall. What
lie will have his assistants doing may well be seen,
however, and tomorrow's workout will give one some
light on the kind of squad which is going to line up
in the fall to train for the next battle with the Bear
from across the bay.
Fifteen hundred to two thousand in the Stadium
will make only a small blot on the sides, but let us do
onr best to make that blot a big one and make up
for the vacancy with noise when the eight teams play.
