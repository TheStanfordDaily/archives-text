Week functions. The gowns will be pro
cured from a Los Angeles firm this year,
and will be cleaned and pressed before
being sent up for the week. Orders
should be placed at once at the Book
store so that the required number may
lie ordered plenty of time in advance.

Treasurer Ernest Wilson notified the
meeting that a three-dollar assessment
will be collected shortly to defray the
early expenses of the graduation. The
1922 class has only some $300 in the
bank and will have to stand some $1000
expense. The Farce and Ball will be
self-supporting, and this extra money
will take carc of the other expenses like
