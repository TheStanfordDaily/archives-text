# MORE MOOT COURTS

The excellence of the debate put on last night by
the members of Phi Delta Phi and Phi Alpha Delta
made the subject of contract, which the talk centered
on, interesting to the laymen attending the meeting,
as well as to the professional men who were there to
judge the debate. A large crowd heard the debate,
and the way the arguments were presented left every
one with rather a thorough understanding of the case,
no matter whether agreeing with the decision of the
judges or not.
These legal delates are things which, if always pre
pared as excellently as the one last night, would go
a long way toward furthering interest in the legal
subjects among the people not directly engaged in the
profession. Such presentation also puts debating
on a higher level. To the men who arranged the facts
and prq>ared the arguments great credit should be
given.
