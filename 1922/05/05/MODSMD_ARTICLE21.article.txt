The dog-gone thing, it would not fit,
And so he put his grandmazon.

."A Young Man's Fancy"
Being a musical drama in two acts. Characters:
Victor Ola, hero, who lives a lonely life in a modern
apartment; A. P. Annafi a widow who lives across the
airshaft.
Scene One, Act the first, the airshaft, with two win
dows on each side of the shaft. As this is the tenth
floor of the apartment, a large number "Ten" should be
painted on the side of the builaing. This indicates the
fact clearly that if the heroine falls out the window the
result will be unpleasant to those living on the ground
floor. At the rise of the curtain past this floor, the hero
is seen leaning carelessly out of his window, peeling
potatoes for his mid-day meal.
Hero (sings)—"To love in Vain." Ah, that is the
question. •
Heroine (looking out her window, also sings)—'lra
Nobody's Baby. I Want Love."
He —"Are you alone, dear?"
Her —"All by myself."
He —"Sweet Lady! Can I come over?" (Dropping po
tato, which falls ten stories to the ground below). He
grabs for it, slips, and recovers himself).
Her —"Why don't you?"
He —" Inever realized. . ." (Jumps out window, and
walks hastily across stage to her window. Curtain
passes on down trip).
Scene Two. same Act: the combination living-dining
sleeping room for which these apartments are famous.
This particular one belongs to the heroine, in one cor
ner is a baby grand piano. Heroine is sitting there when
the curtain rises. She is playing a soft, low air: The
Bowery Blues is low enough.
Heroine (sings)—" You can't go wrong with any Feist
song." ,
Hero (outside) —My dear, I stand here without.
Her (suspiciously)— Without what?
He —Without your love. Lemme in.
Her —"Sweetheart," "Remember," "I Love You.'
(Opens the door-.
He —Cherie!" "Nestle in Your Daddy's Arms."
(Curtain falls. End of Act One
ACT 11.
Later that same day A. P. Anna and Victor are seated
at the table that they have folded down from the side of
the wall. They are eating boiled eggs and drinking
milk.
Her (cracking an egg affectionately on his head —
What a sumptous repast!
He —"Sing me love's lullaby."
Her (trips lightly over the rug on way to piano) —
Help. I'm falling.
He (brutally continues eating egg)— Huh, you didn't
yell till you had fell. (English majors leave theatre en
masse.)
Her (realizing he loves her not, sings)—" Goodbye
Forever, Goodbye forever." "I'm a little nobody that
nobody loves." "Wha-Wha!" (Runs and makes a dive
through window.)
He (finishing the last egg and reaches for hat. he
sings as he carefully brushes crumbs and egg from his
clothes; turns out light and stands silhouetted in door
way. Sings)—" Pleasant Dreams." (He stands a mo
ment in silence, goes over and looks down shaft, then
walks briskly out and closes door, singing): "Good Night
Ladies, we're going to leave you now."
(Curtain should fall quickly before audience recovers
from its surprise.)

."A Young Man's Fancy"
Being a musical drama in two acts. Characters:
Victor Ola, hero, who lives a lonely life in a modern
apartment; A. P. Annafi a widow who lives across the
airshaft.
Scene One, Act the first, the airshaft, with two win
dows on each side of the shaft. As this is the tenth
floor of the apartment, a large number "Ten" should be
painted on the side of the builaing. This indicates the
fact clearly that if the heroine falls out the window the
result will be unpleasant to those living on the ground
floor. At the rise of the curtain past this floor, the hero
is seen leaning carelessly out of his window, peeling
potatoes for his mid-day meal.
Hero (sings)—"To love in Vain." Ah, that is the
question. •
Heroine (looking out her window, also sings)—'lra
Nobody's Baby. I Want Love."
He —"Are you alone, dear?"
Her —"All by myself."
He —"Sweet Lady! Can I come over?" (Dropping po
tato, which falls ten stories to the ground below). He
grabs for it, slips, and recovers himself).
Her —"Why don't you?"
He —" Inever realized. . ." (Jumps out window, and
walks hastily across stage to her window. Curtain
passes on down trip).
Scene Two. same Act: the combination living-dining
sleeping room for which these apartments are famous.
This particular one belongs to the heroine, in one cor
ner is a baby grand piano. Heroine is sitting there when
the curtain rises. She is playing a soft, low air: The
Bowery Blues is low enough.
Heroine (sings)—" You can't go wrong with any Feist
song." ,
Hero (outside) —My dear, I stand here without.
Her (suspiciously)— Without what?
He —Without your love. Lemme in.
Her —"Sweetheart," "Remember," "I Love You.'
(Opens the door-.
He —Cherie!" "Nestle in Your Daddy's Arms."
(Curtain falls. End of Act One
ACT 11.
Later that same day A. P. Anna and Victor are seated
at the table that they have folded down from the side of
the wall. They are eating boiled eggs and drinking
milk.
Her (cracking an egg affectionately on his head —
What a sumptous repast!
He —"Sing me love's lullaby."
Her (trips lightly over the rug on way to piano) —
Help. I'm falling.
He (brutally continues eating egg)— Huh, you didn't
yell till you had fell. (English majors leave theatre en
masse.)
Her (realizing he loves her not, sings)—" Goodbye
Forever, Goodbye forever." "I'm a little nobody that
nobody loves." "Wha-Wha!" (Runs and makes a dive
through window.)
He (finishing the last egg and reaches for hat. he
sings as he carefully brushes crumbs and egg from his
clothes; turns out light and stands silhouetted in door
way. Sings)—" Pleasant Dreams." (He stands a mo
ment in silence, goes over and looks down shaft, then
walks briskly out and closes door, singing): "Good Night
Ladies, we're going to leave you now."

He —"Sing me love's lullaby."
Her (trips lightly over the rug on way to piano) —
Help. I'm falling.
He (brutally continues eating egg)— Huh, you didn't
yell till you had fell. (English majors leave theatre en
masse.)
Her (realizing he loves her not, sings)—" Goodbye
Forever, Goodbye forever." "I'm a little nobody that
nobody loves." "Wha-Wha!" (Runs and makes a dive
through window.)
He (finishing the last egg and reaches for hat. he
sings as he carefully brushes crumbs and egg from his
clothes; turns out light and stands silhouetted in door
way. Sings)—" Pleasant Dreams." (He stands a mo
ment in silence, goes over and looks down shaft, then
walks briskly out and closes door, singing): "Good Night
Ladies, we're going to leave you now."
(Curtain should fall quickly before audience recovers
from its surprise.)

verse, but the author evidently had a free mind when it
was written. Watch for it!
