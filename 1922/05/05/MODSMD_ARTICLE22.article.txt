# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
GENOA
The Allied Reparations Commission
has failed to find that the Rapello
treaty between Germany and Russia is
a violation of the treaty of Versailles,
it was officially announced. This
brings to a definite end the protracted
attempts of the Allies to break up the
agreement.
The interest of the conference again
centers around the Russian memo
randum. France and Belgium persist
in attacking the clause on private
property. It has at last come out that
the underlying reasons for this oppo
sition are economic. The Russians are
permitted under the present clause to
offer compensation to former foreign
owners instead of restoring the actual
property confiscated. This will enable
the Soviet government to bring all the
oil fields under its control and turn
them over for exploitation to a single
syndicate. Negotiations for such an
arrangement are now being carried
on with the Royal Dutch and Shell Oil
companies. The consequences of this
consummation could be entirely avoid
ed, the Belgians claim, by requiring
the Soviet government to restore all
confiiscated property to the original
owners. Whatever the merits of such
a scheme, it can have no other effect
at the present time than to precipi
tate controversy and make che prin
ciples of the memorandum more un
acceptable to the Russians. Further
more it involves an unjustifiable inter
ference in the domestic affairs of their
government which is fundamentally
opposed to private property.
WU'S VICTORY
After being reported dead, General
Wu Pei Fu, the central Chinese com
mander, arose from the grave and de
feated General Chang Tso Lin at
Changstein. This victory practically
completes the invasion of Peking by
Wu. The news was received with
great joy in the Capitol for it is be
lieved there that a victory of Chang
would have meant the end of the
Republic.
