# SPECIAL NOVELTIES PROMISED AT DANCE
## 
### 
Final preparations for the Sophomore
Dance to be given tomorrow evening in
the basketball pavilion have been com
pleted. The dance will be a program
affair, with fourteen dances listed. This
number will be made possible by the
adoption of intermissions shorter than
usual, giving a greater time in which to
enjoy the music that will be furnished by
the special ten-piece orchestra of campus
talent that has been gathered together for
the evening.
One of the novelties will be awarding
of a live-pound box of candy to the lucky
couple who will be chosen by a method
not yet divulged by the committee. The
decorations and lighting, while in con
formance with the general campus senti
ment toward simplicity and non-elabo
rateness, will nevertheless lit especially
into the scheme of the pavilion.
