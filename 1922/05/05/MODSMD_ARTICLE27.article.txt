# PHI DELTA THETA DEFEATS DELTA CHI IN EXTRA INNING
## 
### 
1 he 16 to 10 victory scored by Phi
Delta Theta over Delta Chi in intramural
baseball yesterday afternoon should
stand in the records for some time to
come. Although the score indicates
something of a walkover for Phi Delta
1 heta, 112 the facts prove that it wa ssome
thing quite different.
After taking an early lead and main
taining it, save for the third inning, Delta
Chi took the field for the seventh, and,
usually, final inning, with the score stand
ing at 10 to 5 in their favor. Two men
went out, and Phi Delta Theta opened
up. A volley of singles, combined with
costly errors by Delta Chi. tied the score,
and the game went on into extra innings.
In the eighth, with Taylor *of Delta
Chi out of the game because of an in
jury, Phi Delta Theta went on another
batting spree, the Delta Chi team being
by this time utterly demoralized. Six
men crossed the plate in this inning, and
Delta Chi was unable to gather another
tally.
The Phi Delta Theta battery was Ed
wards and Langford, with Coplen and
Gorman working for Delta Chi. Both
men pitched well, though Coplen tired
after the sixth frame.
Three games in three days proved too
much for the Encina team, that nine
losing a game to Sigma Alpha Epsilon
by a 12 to 3 score. Timely hits and
errors by Encina won the game, which
was practically featureless. Gifford and
Draper made up the winning battery,
with Taylor and Rowland for Encina.
El Toro had little trouble in taking

the measure of Sigma Nu, the final
count standing at 20 to 3. With the
game hopelessly lost. "Lefty" Aydelotte
of the Freshman nine took the mound,
but fared little better than his predeces
sors. The long hit of the day was made
by Anderson, who waited out one of
Connolly's slow balls and poled it into
left field for the circuit. Connolly and
Wright were on battery duty for El
Toro, and Anderson, Aydelotte and
Snook for Sigma Nu.
Delta Tau Delta was forced to forfeit
to Zeta Psi.
"Tiny" Hartranft took a look at base
ball. now that the track season is over,
and with two hits out of three times at
bat helped Kappa Sigma to defeat Theta
Delta Chi by 13 to 4. The only long hit
of the game went to Holmes of Theta
Delta Chi, who cracked out a three
bagger. Rogers and Spires made up the
Kappa Sigma battery, with Harker and
McCready for Theta Delta Chi. Kappa
Sigma has not been defeated this season,
and is conceded an excellent change for
the intramural supremacy.

1 he 16 to 10 victory scored by Phi
Delta Theta over Delta Chi in intramural
baseball yesterday afternoon should
stand in the records for some time to
come. Although the score indicates
something of a walkover for Phi Delta
1 heta, 112 the facts prove that it wa ssome
thing quite different.
After taking an early lead and main
taining it, save for the third inning, Delta
Chi took the field for the seventh, and,
usually, final inning, with the score stand
ing at 10 to 5 in their favor. Two men
went out, and Phi Delta Theta opened
up. A volley of singles, combined with
costly errors by Delta Chi. tied the score,
and the game went on into extra innings.
In the eighth, with Taylor *of Delta
Chi out of the game because of an in
jury, Phi Delta Theta went on another
batting spree, the Delta Chi team being
by this time utterly demoralized. Six
men crossed the plate in this inning, and
Delta Chi was unable to gather another
tally.
The Phi Delta Theta battery was Ed
wards and Langford, with Coplen and
Gorman working for Delta Chi. Both
men pitched well, though Coplen tired
after the sixth frame.
Three games in three days proved too
much for the Encina team, that nine
losing a game to Sigma Alpha Epsilon
by a 12 to 3 score. Timely hits and
errors by Encina won the game, which

Draper made up the winning battery,
with Taylor and Rowland for Encina.
El Toro had little trouble in taking

the measure of Sigma Nu, the final
count standing at 20 to 3. With the
game hopelessly lost. "Lefty" Aydelotte
of the Freshman nine took the mound,
but fared little better than his predeces
sors. The long hit of the day was made
by Anderson, who waited out one of
Connolly's slow balls and poled it into
left field for the circuit. Connolly and
Wright were on battery duty for El
Toro, and Anderson, Aydelotte and
Snook for Sigma Nu.
Delta Tau Delta was forced to forfeit
to Zeta Psi.

of the game went to Holmes of Theta
Delta Chi, who cracked out a three
