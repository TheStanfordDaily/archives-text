# CAMPUS BUYERS TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES FROM CITY MARKET
## 
### 
Members of the Associated Stanford
Buyers decided last night to purchase
meats, vegetables, butter, and eggs,
from Lesser Brothers of San Fran
cisco.. Tomorrow a representative of
the city firm will visit sill the living
groups and eating clubs on the cam
pus to take orders for Monday.
Mr. Lesser conferred with the man
agers of the houses and eating clubs
last night at the Union, and explained
the plan of service which his company
could give. The main difficulty to be
found was in the time of delivery. All
.supplies will be transported from San
Francisco by truck, which, as pro
posed, would arrive here between two
and four in the afternoon. Therefore
meat and vegetables for the next day's
lunch would have to be kept in the
refrigerator over night. Also, it would
be necessary for the cook to remain in
the house during this part of the after
noon. It is probable that morning ser
vice can be secured.
Lesser Brothers deal in retail and
wholesale products and operate a
series of markets, two of which are
among the largest in the bay region.
The prices submitted to the executive
committee of the Association are far
below those of the companies in this
vicinity. Quality has been carefully
considered and the highest grade prod
ucts are assured. Eggs, butter, and
vegetables will be furnished at market
quotations. Orders will be given to
the firm's truck driver each day, and
a monthly credit will be allowed.
Since this part of the co-operative
buying of the forty campus groups
will total about $7,500 per month, a
large saving is anticipated. Repre
sentatives of the associated buyers
have agreed to give the Lesser com
pany a >wo weeks' trial.
