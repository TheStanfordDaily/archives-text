# PHI ALPHA DELTA AWARDED VERDICT IN LEGAL CONTROVERSY
## Unanimous Decision is Given Shepherd and Smith Over Opposing Law Fraternity 
### 
Phi Alpha Delta decisively defeated
Phi Delta Phi in a legal debate held in
the Little Theater last evening. Ralph
Scott, '19, and H. G. Sheppherd, *18, of
Phi Alpha Delta acted as counsel for the
defendant, while B. C. Wohlford, '18,
and led Bowen, '23, were retained by
the plaintiff. The debate was presided
over by Dean Huston, who expressed
the hope that this meeting might be the
beginning of an annual contest between
the two fraternities.
1 he jury which decided the case was
composed of Judge Nourse, Attorney
Hill of San Jose, and Professor Owens,
who substituted for District Attorney
Swartz. Their decision was based 75 per
cent upon presentation and the merits of
the debate and not upon the legal points
involved. The extensive briefs which
were submitted' by each side were also
considered in making the decision. Their
award was unanimously in favor of Phi
Alpha Delta.
In the opening speech, Bowen outlined
the limited set of facts from which the
case was to be presented. A contract for
the sale of two kinds of property had
been broken by the defendant. The two
parties then agreed to settle out of court.
However, the plaintiff brought suit be
fore the settlement was undertaken.
Bowen tried to show that the original
contract was severable into two distinct
contracts and applied for test used in
courts of law to prove his point. In pre
senting the opposition's side of the ques
tion, Ralph Smith attempted to show
that an application of these tests would
defeat the purpose of the two parties in
making the contract. He also maintained
there were peculiar circumstances in the
case which made the contract entire.
The point was then brought up as to
whether the agreement to settle out of
court was a bar to litigation in court.
H. G. Sheppherd brought out that the
agreement implied suspension for at least
one month, therefore the suit was pre
mature. Wohlford's main argument in
attacking this stand was that a suspen
sion is impossible in law and would have
the effect of making suit forever impos
sible. He also showed that a court of
equity could have no jurisdiction over
such a case. In rebuttal the speakers
merely emphasized their main points and
no new evidence was introduced. Bowen
brought laughter from the audience on
several occasions by his references to
misquoted cases, lack of authority, and
"common sense" stand of his opponents.
