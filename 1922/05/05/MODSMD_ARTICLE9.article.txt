# KENNEDY RADIO SET IS RECEIVED HERE FOR EXPERIMENTS
## 
### 
The University has received one
of the finest radio receiving sets yet
made for the use of the Department
of Electrical Engineering in experi
mental work in wireless telephone be
ing carried on by Professor Harris J.
Ryan. The donor is the Colin B.
Kennedy Company of San Francisco,
through Dr. Leonard F. Fuller, vice
president. and chief engineer, who re
ceived his Ph. D. degree at Stanford
in 1919.
The range of this receiver is the
widest yet constructed, running from
the shortest wave lengths to the long
est, from approximately 180 meters
to 26,000 meters and "straight detec
tion of detection with regeneration or
oscillation" may be obtained through
out its entire range, or, in technical
language, through the whole radio
spectrum.
Professor Ryan in many directions
the chief authority in problems of
electrical transmission with wires, is
beginning a series of extensive experi
ments on wireless communication in
which he will make use of this receiv
ing set.
Other gifts which have been receiv
ed by the University recently include
a check for $12,500 from the General
Education Board, as a semi-annual
payment on the Board's grant to the
University made in connection with
its offer of $300,000 towards a million
for the increase of professors' salaries,
which Stanford is now engaged in
raising. While this campaign is in
progress the General Education Board
has agreed to contribue $25,000 a year
to enable salaries to be increased im
mediately.
The anonymous donor of the Stan-
cates Varrius and Randalin in the
theft. The result of this treachery and
the subsequent happenings are worked
out in the plot. A summary of the
story will be printed in the programs
as all the action is done in panto
mime.
Chrysella Dunker, '21, has charge of
the stage managing and arrangements.
The ground for the stage has been
rolled and turfed, and the hillside has
been terraced to form natural seat
ing rows. Benches will be placed on
the terraces. A forest in Britain forms
the main setting for the pageant. In
the background are the outer wall and
main getes of the Roman camp, while
nearby is the village of the Britain
chieftain, Vortiger. This particular
part of the forest is used as a shrine
to the goddess Freya who is the per
sonification of the fields, crops and of
all good things. The villagers collect
here to offer sacrifices to her at the
celebration which is held in her honor.
The pantomime and dramatic work
has been directed by Margaret Bailie,
who is also taking the role of Yarrius.
Janice Dunker, '22, has charge of the
costumes and has designed most of
them.
Miss Edith Pasmore, of the Physical
Education Department, is the director
of the dances. She has selected the
dances which are used, originating sev
eral of them, chose the music best
fitted to them and has coached the
women who take part in them. War
ren D. Allen has had the supervision
of the music and has adapted and
arranged the musical selections so that
they form a continuous accompaniment
for the pageant. In several cases or
chestral scores were not available, and
Mr. Allen orchestrated the parts for
all instruments. The University Or
chestra supplemented by several pro
fessionals will furnish the music.
Tickets are still on sale at Crandall's
in Palo Alto and at the Bookstore.
They may also be obtained tomorrow
afternoon at the gate.

in 1919.
The range of this receiver is the
widest yet constructed, running from
the shortest wave lengths to the long
est, from approximately 180 meters
to 26,000 meters and "straight detec
tion of detection with regeneration or
oscillation" may be obtained through
out its entire range, or, in technical
language, through the whole radio
spectrum.
Professor Ryan in many directions
the chief authority in problems of
electrical transmission with wires, is
beginning a series of extensive experi
ments on wireless communication in
which he will make use of this receiv
ing set.
Other gifts which have been receiv
ed by the University recently include
a check for $12,500 from the General
Education Board, as a semi-annual
payment on the Board's grant to the
University made in connection with
its offer of $300,000 towards a million
for the increase of professors' salaries,
which Stanford is now engaged in
raising. While this campaign is in
progress the General Education Board
has agreed to contribue $25,000 a year
to enable salaries to be increased im
mediately.
The anonymous donor of the Stan-
cates Varrius and Randalin in the
theft. The result of this treachery and
the subsequent happenings are worked
out in the plot. A summary of the
story will be printed in the programs
as all the action is done in panto
mime.
Chrysella Dunker, '21, has charge of
the stage managing and arrangements.
The ground for the stage has been
rolled and turfed, and the hillside has
been terraced to form natural seat
ing rows. Benches will be placed on
the terraces. A forest in Britain forms
the main setting for the pageant. In
the background are the outer wall and
main getes of the Roman camp, while
nearby is the village of the Britain
chieftain, Vortiger. This particular
part of the forest is used as a shrine
to the goddess Freya who is the per
sonification of the fields, crops and of
all good things. The villagers collect
here to offer sacrifices to her at the
celebration which is held in her honor.
The pantomime and dramatic work
has been directed by Margaret Bailie,
who is also taking the role of Yarrius.
Janice Dunker, '22, has charge of the
costumes and has designed most of
them.
Miss Edith Pasmore, of the Physical
Education Department, is the director
of the dances. She has selected the
dances which are used, originating sev
eral of them, chose the music best
fitted to them and has coached the
women who take part in them. War
ren D. Allen has had the supervision
of the music and has adapted and
arranged the musical selections so that
they form a continuous accompaniment
for the pageant. In several cases or
chestral scores were not available, and
Mr. Allen orchestrated the parts for
all instruments. The University Or
chestra supplemented by several pro
fessionals will furnish the music.
Tickets are still on sale at Crandall's
in Palo Alto and at the Bookstore.
They may also be obtained tomorrow
afternoon at the gate.
The University has received one
of the finest radio receiving sets yet
made for the use of the Department
of Electrical Engineering in experi
mental work in wireless telephone be
ing carried on by Professor Harris J.
Ryan. The donor is the Colin B.
Kennedy Company of San Francisco,
through Dr. Leonard F. Fuller, vice
president. and chief engineer, who re
ceived his Ph. D. degree at Stanford
in 1919.
