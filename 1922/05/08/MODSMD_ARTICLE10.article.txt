# Huntington Beach Wins Prep School Track Meet
## 
### 
Huntington Beach High School won
the eighth annual track and field meet of
the California Interscholastic Federation
from forty-seven other preparatory
schools of the state with a total of 16
points. Manual Arts High School of
Los Angeles came second with 12 points,
and Bakersfield obtained third with 11
points.
"Bud" Hauser of Oxnard was the
high point winner of the day. Not only
did he take first in the 12- and 16-pound
shot and the discus, but he also broke the
state records for all three of these
events. He threw the 16-pound shot 45
feet 6 1-2 inches; the 12-pound shot 55
feet 4 3-4 inches; and the discus 144 feet
3 inches. The 16-pound shot was not
counted in the final score or Hauser
would have secured second place for his
team. Nash of Huntington Beach was
the only other record breaker. He broad
jumped 22 feet 4 3-4 inches.
