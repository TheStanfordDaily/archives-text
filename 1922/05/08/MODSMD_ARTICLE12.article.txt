# Amusing Complications of Love and Pocketbook Feature of French Play
## 
### 
Complications must arise when a young
gentleman returns a pocketbook to its
rightful owner, and then falls in love
with the owner's daughter!
Very modern is Celine, the young lady
who wishes to see and hear all that goes
on, even if her ultra-modern father does
order her about in a most disconcerting
manner. All this and more quite upsets
Madame Legrainard, mother of Celine,
who attempts to settle matters by slap
ping everybody.
But a young man with a fortune is not
to be slapped at, and M. and Mme. Le
grainard, who are, alas, quite mercenary,
willingly concede the daughter to him.
And did you ever hear of anything so
artistic and chic as a duel with teacups?
This is only one of the amusing incidents
in the Labiche comedy which is to be
staged Wednesday, May 10, in the Little
Theater by the members of Le Cercle
Francais.
