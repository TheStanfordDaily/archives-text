Two men arrived on the campus about
five weeks ago and started to work with

hard, and steadily every day, and last
Saturday showed the campus what they
had accomplished.
"Pop" Warner and Claude Thornhill
were the men. They left yesterday, at
the close of spring practice, but they left
behind them the beginnings of a football
organization which, by its own confes
sion, knew more football than any Stan
ford team after similar training for the
past three, years. In " 'Pop' Installs the

scribes for the May Pictorial, on sale by
the middle of this week, just what meth

ers of the Pictorial just what will hap

described by H. B. Rorke, '24, in the
coming issue. "Ed," who took charge of
the Stanford department in February,
and has since made his blue uniform
with brass buttons known all over the
campus, has some distinct ideas about
lire prevention on the Farm. He sets
them forth in bis own style, backed by
twenty-five years' experience with the
San Francisco fire department. In ad
dition, lie has some vivid exposures of
students' carelessness of fire risk, which
are printed accompanying the article.
