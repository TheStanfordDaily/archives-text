# SPRING PAGEANT IS PRESENTED ON LAGUNITA SHORE
## Scenic Effects and Colorful Costumes Combine to Make Performance Huge Success 
### Mary Baker, '25 
Colorful scenic effects and costumes,
excellent music and dancing, all con
tributed to the success of "The Coro
nation of Randalin," the Frst Spring
Pageant given by the Women of Stan
ford, a performance which will be a
precedent for future productions of the
same typ£.
Foresta Hodgson, '24, in the title
role of Randalin, was a lovely Britain
maiden who was dedicated to Spring at
the celebration in honor of the goddess
Freya. Her dancing was character
ized by graceful naturalness and spon
taneity which made her seem, indeed,
the young Britain girl with whom
Varrius fell in love.
Margaret Bailie, '24, as Varrius, had
the diffcult part of the young lieut
enant who is disgraced and dismissed
from the Roman army. This was
caused through the jealousy of Oc
tavia, the girl whom he scorned when
he saw Randalin. Miss Bailie's act
ing was almost flawless. She also
directed and organized the entire page
ant.
In the character of Octavia, Helen
Whitney, '24, had the largest scope for
dramatic work. Before she saw that
Varrius would have nothing to do with
her, she was attractive and alluring.
When her efforts to gain his attention
proved fruitless she gave way to fits
of temper and danced in a fury. Her
dancing was perfect in rhythm and
technique.
The rival leaders of Britain and
Rome were portrayed by Mary Ma
thews, '22, and Mary Learnard, '23.
Miss Mathews, as Vortiger, maintain
ed the unconquered dignity and bear
ing of the Britains while Miss Learn
ard stalked with the tyrannical pom
posity of the Roman governor, Aulus.
One of the main factors in the suc
cess of the pageant was the stage ef
fect. Chrysella Dunker, '21, as stage
manager planned the setting. The wall
and main gates of the Roman camp
formed an effective background for
the dancers. The costumes presented
an array of blending hues which added
to the attractive scenic effect of the
spectacle. These were planned by
Janice Dunker, '22.
Music which was continuous during
the performance made a pleasing ac
companiment which heightened dra
matic interest in the action of the
pageant. Warren D. Allen, university
organist, had charge of the music and
its arrangement, The University or
chestra, suplemented by professionals,
furnished the music.
A fairy carnival formed one of the
most pleasing scenes of the masque.
Elves, bumblebees, butterflies and
fairy animals gamboled and romped
while they thought they were safe
from the eyes of humans. At the
sound of the marching Roman army
they all fled to safety with the ex
ception of two fearless rabbits who
lingered behind after the others had
left. The pumpkins, mocked the dan
cing of the Roman with their clown
ish imitations until they were chased
away by Randalin.
"Randalin's maidens made a lovely
picture with their brilliant costumes
and long garlands of green. A cymbal
dance was unusual and truly Roman
with its studied technique and clash
of cymbals.

from the Roman army. This was
caused through the jealousy of Oc
tavia, the girl whom he scorned when
he saw Randalin. Miss Bailie's act
ing was almost flawless. She also
directed and organized the entire page
ant.
In the character of Octavia, Helen
Whitney, '24, had the largest scope for
dramatic work. Before she saw that
Varrius would have nothing to do with
her, she was attractive and alluring.
When her efforts to gain his attention
proved fruitless she gave way to fits
of temper and danced in a fury. Her
dancing was perfect in rhythm and
technique.
The rival leaders of Britain and
Rome were portrayed by Mary Ma
thews, '22, and Mary Learnard, '23.
Miss Mathews, as Vortiger, maintain
ed the unconquered dignity and bear
ing of the Britains while Miss Learn
ard stalked with the tyrannical pom
posity of the Roman governor, Aulus.
One of the main factors in the suc
cess of the pageant was the stage ef
fect. Chrysella Dunker, '21, as stage
manager planned the setting. The wall
and main gates of the Roman camp
formed an effective background for
the dancers. The costumes presented
an array of blending hues which added
to the attractive scenic effect of the
spectacle. These were planned by
Janice Dunker, '22.
Music which was continuous during
the performance made a pleasing ac
companiment which heightened dra
matic interest in the action of the
pageant. Warren D. Allen, university
organist, had charge of the music and
its arrangement, The University or
chestra, suplemented by professionals,
furnished the music.
A fairy carnival formed one of the
most pleasing scenes of the masque.
Elves, bumblebees, butterflies and
fairy animals gamboled and romped
while they thought they were safe
from the eyes of humans. At the
sound of the marching Roman army
they all fled to safety with the ex
ception of two fearless rabbits who
lingered behind after the others had
left. The pumpkins, mocked the dan
cing of the Roman with their clown
ish imitations until they were chased
away by Randalin.
"Randalin's maidens made a lovely
picture with their brilliant costumes
and long garlands of green. A cymbal
dance was unusual and truly Roman
with its studied technique and clash
of cymbals.
Colorful scenic effects and costumes,
excellent music and dancing, all con
tributed to the success of "The Coro
nation of Randalin," the Frst Spring
Pageant given by the Women of Stan
ford, a performance which will be a
precedent for future productions of the
same typ£.
Foresta Hodgson, '24, in the title
role of Randalin, was a lovely Britain
maiden who was dedicated to Spring at
the celebration in honor of the goddess
Freya. Her dancing was character
ized by graceful naturalness and spon
taneity which made her seem, indeed,
the young Britain girl with whom
Varrius fell in love.
