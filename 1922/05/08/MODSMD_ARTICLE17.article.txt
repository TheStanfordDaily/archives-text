# PROGRAM OF EVENTS FOR JUNIOR WEEK IS NOW IN SHAPE
## 
### 
Junior Week has arrived, and the
program of entertainment which will
begin Thursday evening with the
Water Carnival at Lagunita will con
tinue through Friday and Saturday,
ending with the Junior Opera.
The springtime splendor of Lagunita
will form an appropriate setting for
the arrangement of musical numbers
which will make up the largest part
of the Water Carnival program on
Thursday night. At 8:30, the Stanford
Band of 40 pieces will begin the pro
gram with some martial selection.
Following this there will be music by
a special orchestra playing from a
boat close to the shore. Two quar
tets, under the direction of Warren D.
Allen, will present several vocal har
monies. At the conclusion of these
numbers, fireworks will be started and
last about a half an hour. A repre
sentative of the dealers in
San Francisco will be secured to pre
pare the pyrotechnics so that an ef
fective display may be assured.
The 1923 From on Friday evening,
the first to be given in the new bask
etball pavilion, will continue the
spirit of spring through the decora
tions. Whitmer's orchestra, augmented
to ten pieces, will furnish the music.
The barn-like appearance of the pavili
on will be eliminated by a mass of
streamers hung even with the bal
conies.
On Saturday morning, commencing
at 10:30, the Lake Sports will be held
at Lagunita. There will be canoe
races for both men and women, and.
on accoun of a large demand, mixed
teams may also be entered. The canoe
tilting contests promise to contain
plenty of fights. Paul Beuter, chair
man of the Lake Sports Committee,
urges that those desiring to enter the
events secure partners at once. Swim
ming and diving contests for men and
women will conclude the program.
For all these events prizes will be
presented by merchants of Palo Alto.

For Saturday afternoon, efforts are
being made to include William Tilden,
world's champion tennis player, and
William Johnston, ranked as number
two in the United States, to give an
exhibition match on the varsity courts.
The Junior Opera, "Up On a Lad
der," written by Rosemary Drachman,
'22, and Tom Kleckner, '18, will con
clude the week's festivities on Satur
day night. This yeaa-'s production
will contain some of the best musical
selections by campus composers ihat
have been written for any Junior
Opera. Excellent chorus work and
unusually good harmony will also feat
ure the opera.
