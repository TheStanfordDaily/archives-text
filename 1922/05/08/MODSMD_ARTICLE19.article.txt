# DOING ITS PART

### 
Tree and shrub planting in the court of the Union
is nearly complete. The effect is for the most part
that of a garden that has been in existence for a
long time rather than a place that has been trans
formed over night, so to speak. The little side
courts by the entrances to the new building are
beautiful with combinations of ferns and purple
flowers and little Japanese fur trees.
This has been made possible by the hard work
of the gardening force of the University. The gar
den spots are to be in as good shape as possible by
May 20, Alumni Day, and all the men from Super
intendent Nyquist to the lesser workers are at their
jobs trying to make the place a sight to please the
eyes of the alumni when they come back.
This interest is being shown by these men because
they are interested in their work for the credit that
it will bring to the grounds as well as to the indi
viduals. All this program is a part of the Univer
sity scheme in doing its part in making the home
coming day a big success. There is no doubt that
the administration and the committee in charge of
the day will do all in their power to make each
member of the alumni body glad that he has come
back to the farm for a day.
