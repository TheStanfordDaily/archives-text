# STUDENTS WILL BE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO AID ENDOWMENT
## 
### 
Students who have not contributed to
the endowment will be given an oppor
tunity to do so in the near future. Due
to the fact that the four-day campaign
on the campus did not give the canvassers
sufficient time to call upon all the stu
dents in the University, the extension
committee has decided to make it pos
sible for everyone to subscribe.
The drive throughout the state among
the alumni organizations has been a suc
cessful one. In each district those in
charge have called personally on each
alumnus and have met with success in
every locality. The campaign is now
drawing to a close and Stanford under
graduates are to be given this oppor
tunity to raise tiie percentage of those
subscribing.
At the present time but 65 per cent of
the student body have contributed to the
fund. The cominittee hopes to raise this
percentage when the students are givifn
another chance to subscribe.
During the past ten years the largest
colleges and universities of the United
States have conducted campaigns similar
to the one now being conducted at Stan
ford. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Vassar,
Columbia, Fordham, Holy Cross, Hamil
ton and Michigan are some of the larger
schools that have successfully conducted
drives for funds. Most of these schools
have student bodies larger than Stan
ford's and none of them has had less
than 85 per cent of their students con
tribute. The highest percentage is 95.
Definite plans nor the date for opening
the campaign have not been announced,
but the committee in charge intimates
that an entirely new sytsem will be put
into operation.
