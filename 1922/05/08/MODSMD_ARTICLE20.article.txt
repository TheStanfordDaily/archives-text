The "Coronations of Randalin," presented Satur
day afternoon on the Lake shore by the women of
the University, was a spectacle piece, worked out
-excellently, that merits our appreciation. Not only
did the women go to great trouble to make the set
ting and costuming for the play realistic, but the
individuals so well got into their parts that nowhere
did the action fall down.
A site like the shores of Lagunita made an ideal
spot for the presentation and the effect from the
lake was beautiful, with the many combinations of
color upon the background of green of the hillside.
Aside from the worthwhile purpose for which the
pageant was given, we would like to see more of
the same sort of shows in the future.
