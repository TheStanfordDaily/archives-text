# PRACTICE IS OVER
## 
### 
The games between The several teams on Satur
day finished up the season of spring practice and
showed the fans something of the play that will
lie used in the fall. To the average person who went
out to see some new formations pulled by the teams
on Saturday there came some disappointment. Noth
ing particularly startling showed up, and it was not
hard to pick out the same men playing together then
that had to a large extent played together before.
One thing did show up, however. That was the
large number of men who had survived the five
weeks of practice. Many of these had not been out
the full time, but they have at least all gotten some
what acquainted with Warner and his ideas on the
game. This has been the main effort of the coaches
in the last month, together with giving them a line
on the men who will receive immediate attention in
the fall.
At the opening of the Fall Quarter we will have
a number of new men wearing the Cardinal. With
the training they are going to get, they should
develop into a formidable organization before the
expiration of six weeks, when they meet for another
'T'ig Game."
