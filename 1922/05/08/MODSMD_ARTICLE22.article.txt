"CARDINAL TRACK ARTISTS OUT-RADIO
CINDER MEN OF NEW YORK INSTITUTION
By the close score of 67.89427 to 67.8942, the Card team
today whipped the Smith Brothers Institute in a radio
track match. The hundred was especially thrilling, but
Black of Stanford beat out Black of S. B. I. by five
seconds, according to the radio returns. The pole vault
was left in doujjt, as the height was too high for even
the high-frequency sending set of the easterners. The
wave-lengths of the receivers was just long enough to
carry the results of the broad jump—24 ft. 5.396274
