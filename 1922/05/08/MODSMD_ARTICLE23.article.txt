# FREE SPEECH

### 
The right of free speech, so jealously defended by
liberals and radicals, has its insurance, they point
out, in the Federal and State constitutions. It is true,
however, that all freedom has certain inevitable
limits, those limits being erected at the lines where
abuse begins. A seditious speaker, at war time, for
instance, or a violent agitator who may incite mobs to
criminal action, should not be given free reign. Our
State Constitution, almost contradictory in its word
ing, recognizes these possibilities and provides for
them in the very clause referred to bv the free speech
defenders. The State Constitution provides': "Every
citizen may freely speak, write and publish his senti
ments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse
of that right." Both the likelihood of abuse of that
guaranteed freedom and the necessity for punitive
consequences are recognized in the latter statement of
law.—Daily Palo Alto Times.
