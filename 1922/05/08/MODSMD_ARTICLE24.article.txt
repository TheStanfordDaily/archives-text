The Daily tries to cover the field of the campus
and the immediate vicinity with a regular system of
assignments and tries to get in all the news that is of
local interest. It is impossible to gather all the things
that happen around the University, however.
To help us out it will be a great aid if when some
thing comes up that is of interest to the student body
or faculty, for there is the bulk of the Daily's
readers, you will telephone it in to the office of the
Daily. There is some one at the office all the time
from 10 to 12 o'clock each day of publication who
will be glad to take down the item for publication.
The number of the Daily phone is 1074.
