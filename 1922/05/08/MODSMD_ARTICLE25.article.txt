# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
THE ANGLO-FRENCH ENTENTE
Loyd George has notified Louis
Barthou, the head of the French Dele
gation at Genoa, that the Anglo French
Entente will be terminated if the
French continue to support Belgium's
insistence on the restoration of pri
vate property in Russia. At the same
time in Paris the Representatives of
the devastated areas are demanding
that the Government force Germany
to live pu to the Reparations clause
of the Versailles Treaty, even if Eng
land continues not to support France
in this demand. Whether the Allies
themselves can continue to act har
moniously or not is exceedingly doubt
ful. A definite break in their ranks
would cause the complete failure of
the Conference and a probable
scramble to obtain individual conces
sions from Russia.
CIVIL WAR IN CHINA
General Wu has succeeded in rout
ing General Chang, the War Lord of
Manchuria, who was considered by
many as the strongest of the military
potentates of China, General Wu
maintains that his aim is to bring
peace and unity in China. He hopes to
call a Constitutional Convention made
up of representatives from all China,
and he is allowing the present gov
ernment of Peking to continue to func
tion until some definite results can be
obtained. If the report is true that
he has ordered the allotment of a hun
dred pounds of rice for the support of
the defeated troops and provided he
can supply it he may at least be
given credit for beginning in the right
way.
