Two students, Jim Clark, '23, and G. G.
Freer, '23, were injured in an automobile
accident Saturday night. Clark, who was
driving, attempted to make a sharp turn
on the La Honda road at a high rate of
speed, the car went over the side of the
road and rolled to the bottom of a gully.
The men were picked up soon afterward
and taken to the Peninsular Hospital.
The exact extent of their injuries has
not yet been determined. Freer is prob
ably the more seriously hurt, the car fall
ing upon him. Clark was thrown clear
of the car and may have escaped with
some severe bruises.
