# PALO ALTO CLUB HAS PAINTING EXHIBIT AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
A loan exhibition of modern paintings,
gathered under the auspices of the Palo
Alto Art Club, opened in the main room
of the Stanford Art Gallery Sunday,
May 7. The canvases on display are all
owned by Palo Alto and campus resi
dents and are loaned for the showing.
Among the most interesting of the
group is an entire wall of paintings done
by William Keith. Mr. Keith is one of
the most distinguished California artists
and is well known abroad. He is not
only the only Californian who hps ever
exhibited in the Metropolitan Art Gal
lery but was one of the two artists from
this state that had an individual room in
the Palace of Fine Arts at the exposition
of 1915. It is said of Keith's work that
a distinct change took place in his style
after the earthquake of 1906, and some
from each period have been procured.
The work of George Noyes and Bolton
Colt Brown has an added attraction from
the fact that both the men were con
nected with the Stanford faculty, Mr.
Noyes being the first head of the Art
department. An entire wall has been
given over to the \Vater colors of Sydney
Yard and a large group of oils of Frank
Duveneck were obtainagle from his son,
who is a resident of Palo Alto.
The generous response to the call for
paintings has assured the success of the
exhibit, and members of the Palo Alto
Art Club appreciate the quick action and
courtesy shown by exhibitors.
Invitations were extended by the Art
Club to a private view held Saturday,
May 6, from 8 to 10. The exhibit was
then opened to the public and will con
tinue until May 31.
