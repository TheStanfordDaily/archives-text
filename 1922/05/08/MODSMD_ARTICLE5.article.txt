# STANFORD NET TEAM WILL MEET PURPLE AND GOLD PLAYERS
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team will
meet the University of Washington squad
in a dual tourney Wednesday afternoon,
preliminary to the opening of the Pa
cific Coast Conference tournament at
Berkeley on Thursday. Last year the
Purple and Gold team was the only uni
versity squad to defeat the Cardinal
players throughout their extensive
schedule following the conference meet
at Eugene, Ore.
The University of Washington team is
built around Taylor and Allen, a com
bination which is rated among the best
in the northwest. Last summer they
won the northwest sectional doubles
tournament and made an exceptional
showing in the national tourney held in
the East. In the match with Stanford
last summer in Seattle, Allen won his
match with Davies while the doubles
bout also went to the northerners.
The Cardinal squad has been going
through light practice matches since their
victories at Ojai and are in good condi
tion for four days of play this week. In
the tourney with the University of
Washington, Neer will probably meet
Marshall Allen in the opening bout of
the singles event, while Davies will be
matched with Taylor. Hinckley will rep
resent Stanford in the. third of the
singles matches.
Stanford will enter a full team in the
third annual Pacific Coast Conference
tourney which will be held Thursday,
Friday and Saturday on the University
of California courts. In the singles
tournament Jimmy Davies will be de
fending his title against some of the best
players on the coast. Last year Davies
eliminated both Bates and Levy of the
Blue and Gold team in the final rounds,
winning the championship for the second
consecutive year.
