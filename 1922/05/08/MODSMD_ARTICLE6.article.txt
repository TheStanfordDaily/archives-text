# CHINESE CUSTOMS TO FORM LECTURE TOPIC TOMORROW EVENING
## 
### 
Chinese scenery and peoples will be the
topic of the lecture which Professor
Bailey Willis of the Geology department
will deliver tomorrow evening in the
Little Theater.
Professor Willis was thrown in close
contact with the Chinese people in the
course of a nine months' walk through
China during the winter and spring of
1903 and 1904. The walk "covered 3000
miles, and extended from Peking to the
border of Tibet, and then south through
the mountain ranues of central China
and terminated at Shanghai.
The trip was undertaken for the pur
pose of making a geological study of the
country, under the auspices of the Car
negie Institution in Washington, D. C.
which awarded a gold medal in recogni
tion of the work which Professor Willis
and his companions accomplished.
The route followed during part of the
trip was one which had not been trav
eled by Europeans since 1720, when the
Jesuit Fathers made a careful study of
the nature of the country and laid the
foundation for the present maps of
China.
The Chinese, according to Professor
Willis, have a way of amusing them
selves at the expense of the foreigner
which is not always to his pleasure and
comfort. On the other hand they readily
appreciate kindness, and are to be ad
mired for their loyalty and devoted serv
ice under difficulties.
