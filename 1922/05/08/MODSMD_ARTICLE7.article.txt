# PRACTICE GAMES END SPRING FOOTBALL
## Warner and DeGroot Satisfied With Showing; "Pop" and Thornhill Leave Campus 
### 
Spring football practice came to a
close Saturday with the playing of four
practice games in the Stanford stadium.
Eight picked teams,-divided as equally
as possible, were used. Two teams op
posed each other for fifteen minutes,
when two fresh teams were placed in the
field. All of the hundred candidates
who have been working out under Glenn
Warner and "Tiny" Thornhill were
given a chance to exhibit their skill dur
ing the afternoon.
About four hundred spectators were
present, and a general spirit of satisfac
tion at the exhibition of the men was
evident. Although no spectacular plays
were used by any of the teams, line
bucks, end runs, and one or two passes
completing the list, the men showed in
their tackling, starting in the line, run
ning down of punts, and especially of
forming interference, that the coaching
of the veteran of the football field will
be of immense value in the quick form
ing of a team next year.
Several of the veteran players of last
year showed promise of even better work
this coming, season. Wilcox tore loose
for three long 30- and 35-yard runs
around end; Ludeke loomed as a "go
gettem" tackle; Dud DeGroot was at his
old place in the center of the line. Sev
eral new players stood out as promising
material, and Coach Warner was pleased
with the way the men had mastered the
details that he has been showing them.
At least three ail-American prospects
are on the team, according to Warner.
In the backtield there are at least eight
good men; in the line three good men
for every position.
Immediately after the games Warner
left for Springville, N. Y., where he will
remain until his coaching duties call him
to Pittsburgh. Thornhill will remain in
Los Angeles until fall practice here,
when he will be joined by Andy Kerr,
head coach, and I£. C. Hunt, freshman
coach. These men will form the coach
ing staff for next year.
Dud DeGroot, captain of next year's
varsity, was well pleased with the work
that has been accomplished. In speaking
of Warner, he said :
"Every man who turned out for prac
tice this spring, from the old varsity
players to the 'greenest pea,' learned
something. For those who knew noth
ing the basic principles were empha
sized ; for those who have had experience
the fine points were given out in an end
less variety. And Warner and Thorn
bill are the men who can give out this
dope: there is no question about that.
"Glenn Warner will not be with us
until next spring, much to our sorrow,
but he goes away leaving in each player's
heart a great deal of respect and a real
feeling of affection. We will be glad in
deed when we can claim 'Pop' for our
own and not have to share him with
Pitt.
" I hornhill won the immediate good
will and respect of all the players as
being one of the 'regularest' of 'regular
•guys.' He is living in Los Angeles and
wants to get in touch with any of the
men who will be in the south this sum
mer. The praise and good will that the
linemen showered 'Tiny' with speaks for
itself. He knows his work, he never
tells you, he shows you. Why shouldn't
we have a good team next year?"
