# PRACTICE GAMES END SPRING FOOTBALL
## Warner and DeGroot Satisfied With Showing; "Pop" and Thornhill Leave Campus 
### 
Spring football practice came to a
close Saturday with the playing of four
practice games in the Stanford stadium.
Eight picked teams,-divided as equally
as possible, were used. Two teams op
posed each other for fifteen minutes,
when two fresh teams were placed in the
field. All of the hundred candidates
who have been working out under Glenn
Warner and "Tiny" Thornhill were
given a chance to exhibit their skill dur
ing the afternoon.
About four hundred spectators were
present, and a general spirit of satisfac
tion at the exhibition of the men was
evident. Although no spectacular plays
were used by any of the teams, line
bucks, end runs, and one or two passes
completing the list, the men showed in
their tackling, starting in the line, run
ning down of punts, and especially of
forming interference, that the coaching
of the veteran of the football field will
be of immense value in the quick form
ing of a team next year.
Several of the veteran players of last
year showed promise of even better work
this coming, season. Wilcox tore loose
for three long 30- and 35-yard runs
around end; Ludeke loomed as a "go
gettem" tackle; Dud DeGroot was at his
old place in the center of the line. Sev
eral new players stood out as promising
material, and Coach Warner was pleased
with the way the men had mastered the
details that he has been showing them.
At least three ail-American prospects
are on the team, according to Warner.
In the backtield there are at least eight
good men; in the line three good men
for every position.
Immediately after the games Warner
left for Springville, N. Y., where he will
remain until his coaching duties call him
to Pittsburgh. Thornhill will remain in
Los Angeles until fall practice here,
when he will be joined by Andy Kerr,
head coach, and IÂ£. C. Hunt, freshman
coach. These men will form the coach
ing staff for next year.
Dud DeGroot, captain of next year's
varsity, was well pleased with the work
