# TEN MEN PICKED FOR MEET AT CAMBRIDGE
## Minsky, Daly, Hayes Included in Entries; Team Plans to Start for Harvard, May 19 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton this morn
ing named the ten Stanford track
stars who will compose the Cardinal
delegation to the I. C. A. A. A. A.
championships at the Harvard stadi
um, May 27 and 28.
The squad which Templeton hopes
will bring the cinder-path champion
ship of the United States to Stanford
is as follows: Captain Hanner, Falk,
Hartranft, Kirksey, Sudden, Hayes,
Black, Williamson, Minsky and Daly.
It., has . been., settled., for., several
months that Stanford would send the
largest team back east since it entered
the I. C. A. A. A. A., three years ago.
Twelve was the number most common
ly mentioned, but the illness of How
ell, and Wilcox's studies, respectively,
have kept these two at home.
Of the ten, Kirksey and Falk are
veterans of former I. C. A. A. A. A.
meets... For two years in succession
the Cardinal sprinter has won the na
tional title in the 100-yard dash, Falk
placed second to Earl Thompson,
world's champion, in the 220 yard low
hurdles in the meet at Philadelphia
last year. Thompson is no longer
competing in intercollegiate competi
tion. This is the first year that the
javelin has been included in the list
of events, and will be Manner's first
test in nation-wide competition.
Led by Kirksey and Sudden, as
great a sprinting team as there is in
any university, the ten-man squad
should finish close to first place. Kirk
sey will enter both dashes provided his
leg can stand the strain of the numer
ous heats. Sudden, according to Pad
dock, the champion sprinter, will
probably beat the easterners. Falk
and Hayes are counted on for points
in the low hurdles, and the captain
elect may take a place in the highs.
Hanner and Hartranft, provided the
latter recovers from his sore arm,
which has been bothering him for
several weeks, come close to being the
"class" of the country in the javelin,
