# SEAT SALE FOR OPERA TO OPEN WEDNESDAY
## Cast And Choruses of "Up On A Ladder" Rehearse Entire Play 
### 
Junior Opera principals and choruses
have been working during the week-end
on complete rehearsals of both acts.
Since Thursday night, the opening act
was put together, the co-ordination of
cast and chorus has progressed rapidly.
While Coach Lester Seib directed the
dancing, Coach Gordon Davis concen
trated his attention on the characters.
The first rehearsals of the whole produc

tion brought out especially the excellent
harmony of trained voices and excep
tionally clever chorus work.
The ticket sale for the Opera will be
held on Wednesday at 1 o'clock in the
Administration Building. Members of
the faculty may purchase seats tomor
row at 1 o'clock at J. E. McDowell's
office.
Ivo Copeland is largely responsible for
what promises to be one of the best bits
of comedy in the show when she does an
eccentric dance called "The Scarecrow."
The accompanying song tells how to get
rid of masculine attentions. Miss Cope
land receives ample assistance from Paul
Clafln, "22, and Fred Hughes, '23, in the
art of producing laughs.
The combination of dancing, solo, and
reciting which is attained in "Youth and
Age" has _ been given the finishing
touches. In this song, which was written
by Richard Malaby, a fast melody runs
counter to a slower melody. Geraldine
Watt, '24, and three male characters be
gin by singing the verse, while Helen
Whitney, '24. and Foresta Hodgson, '24,
dance to the slow melody. In the second
part Miss Watt sings the rippling notes
of the fast movement, and the rest carry
the slow melody. A third variation is
gained when Miss Hodgson recites the
lyric.
A new custom has been inaugurated
with this year's Opera in that all scenes
have been built by members of Gordon
Davis' class in "Theater Workshop."
The sets were designed by Edward
Farmer, '23, and were constructed and
painted by the frien of the class under
the direction of Clyde Coakley, '23.
Chrysclla Dunker, '21, had charge of the
draperies, which were made and dyed
by the women. Two sets of scenery al
most certain to command applause are
the result of their efforts. In addition
to this, the class will do the stage work.
