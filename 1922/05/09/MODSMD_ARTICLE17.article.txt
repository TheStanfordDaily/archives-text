# FINAL EFFORT FOR THE ENDOWMENT QUOTA UNDER WAY
## 
### 
Completion of the student endowment
fund will be started on the campus as
soon as the organization can he com
pleted. The continuation committee of the
endowment campaign, in reviewing the
work done since the opening, found that
there were some thousand students who
had not been reached by the first drive.
At that time, there were 2450 students in
the University, of whom 1645 contrib
uted. Since then 125 new students have
come in, making it possible and feasible
to extend the work of the first campaign
to reach these students.
This will be the final effort for the
"First Million,"' and it is expected that
it will give force and a new vigor to the
kilumni and outside campaign. The idea
of the committee in charge is not so
much to reach the $200,000 set at the
quota, as to have every man and woman
in the University contribute something,
and to raise the percentage from its pres
ent 65 per cent to 100 per cent.
The largest groups at present which
have not contributed to a large extent
are the Palo Alto students, the fraterni
ties, and the commuters.
