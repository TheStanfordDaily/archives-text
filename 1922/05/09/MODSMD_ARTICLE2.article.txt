# EUPHRONIA TO DEBATE KU KLUX KLAN PROBLEM
## 
### 
"Resolved, That the Ku Klux Klan
organization should be abolished," is
the question that will be discussed at
a meeting of Euphronia Debating So
ciety, to be held next Thursday, at
7:30 o'clock, in Room 12, of the Law
building.
The affirmative of the question will
be upheld by S. J. Main, '20, and E. E.
Gerkin, '22, while A. L. Crawford, '22,
and E. Hirschfeld, '20, will make up the
negative team. Speeches will be 7
minutes in length with three minute
rebuttals.
The Ku Klux Klan problem has
come before the American people as
a result of the recent night raids in
Los Angeles. Since that time thou
sands of citizens have become mem
bers of the organization. Opponents
of the Klan claim that it is un-Amer
ican from every standpoint and that
race hatred, intolerance, and persecu
tion are encouraged. These charges
are denied by the Klan officials, who
say that the main purpose oÂ£ their or
ganization is for clean American poli
tics.
Visitors are invited to attend the
meeting, Thursday.
