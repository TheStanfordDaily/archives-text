# STATESMAN URGES WORLD SOLIDARITY BEFORE ASSEMBLY
## Opportunities For Dependable Young Men and Women-Unlimited, Says Statesman. 
### 
A united western hemisphere working?
for world solidarity, is the aim which
the Honorable John Barrett, former di
rector general of the Pan-American
Union, presented at assembly this morn
ing.
The United States faces the unrest of
the continents of Asia and Europe, anÂ«f
it is its influence which will serve to
keep down the struggle for supremacy,
according to Mr. Barrett. To do this,
he continued, we must work with those
countries for the good of all humanity
rather than for that of a separate part.
"Every part of the word today is call
ing for young men and women," said
Mr. Barrett in speaking of the many op
portunities opened to the youth of this
generation by the recent war. "The
great need is for dependable men and
women with big international minds."
Mr. Barrett emphasized especially the
enormous opportunities on the Pacific
coast, which he characterized as "just
beginning to feel the pulse of life."
Mr. Barrett stressed the importance of
a universal understanding of interna
tional questions. "All nations have the
same relationship before God," he said.
"We should look upon the different na
tions as personalities, living persons
which are the embodiment of their coun
tries. At the Washington conference for
the limitation of armaments one man
represented a nation, Mr. Balfour was
England, Mr. Hughes, America, and so
on. In this light international questions
become simple and their understanding
more assured."
The Pan-American Union, on which
Mr. Barrett served as director general,
is today one of the most important in
ternational institutions. Its building at
Washington was one of the main points
of interest for the foreign ministers who
attended the disarmament conference. In
this building, pointed out .Mr, Barrett,
ministers and ambassadors assembled to
confer and work out the problems of the
Western Hemisphere and since its es
tablishment there has been no war be
tween American republics. "In short,"
he continued, "this union typifies the
solidarity which will hold the western
hemisphere together. It is this solidarity
which must stand against the tidal waves
of unrest and bolshevism which we face
to maintain the great principles of Chris
tianity which must endure."
Mr. Barrett urged the realization of
the enormous opportunities for young
men and women among college students.
He spoke especially of the innumerable
chances open in South America and com
pared them to those existing in Califor
nia and the western states some sixty
years ago. He sketched his own early
career after working his way through
college and told of realizing his desire to
come to San Francisco and the West.
Senator Stanford was one of the men
whom Barrett met as a young man and
he recalled the Senator's advice to keep
looking toward the Pacific for oppor
tunity. "I believe in the success of the
endowed institution," said Mr. Barrett,
in speaking of the University and its
wonderful war record and the record of
its graduates. He paid especitl tribute
to Dr. Jordan and spoke of him as the
"man at whose feet he had long been a
student of international affairs."
Professor C. D. Marx presided at the
assembly.
