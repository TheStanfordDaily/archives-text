Morris Kirksey, is the leading article in

nal luminaries as Black, Minsky, and

ments on records and record-breakers by
the eye-witness observations of two
years.
Lane Falk sailing over the last hurdle
for a five-point tally in the "Big Meet"
is the photograph forming the cover
page. A double-page of pictures in the
center shows the line-up and opening
scrimmage of the baseball fight, pic
tures of the California-Stanford track
meet, including a shot of Bill Black as
he cleared the bar for the tieing vault
which sent Norris into third place, the
principals and chorus of the Junior
Opera, the leading concessions at Vanity
Fair, and a view of "Tiny" Thornhill in
action.
The new dormitory system, the first
unit of which is to be started this
'23, in the coming number. In "Under
One Roof," he tells what will happen
quarter, is described by Tom Irwin,
when the first building goes up, and
when the system is completedâ€”a re
newal and reinforcement of Stanford
democracy. Every student on the
campus will be housed in the same
type of building, which is to bfe a
small-group dormitory with special ac
commodations for every type of organi
zation. The plan will capitalize the
"D" in democracy.
"What of the Military?" asks Leon
T. David, '25. The Stanford system
of military training, he says, is dif
ferent from any other college unit, and
moreover, brings out the required aim
of adequate military training without
resorting to compulsion. What its
place is in the University now, and
what plans are being made for future
training of Stanford men for artillery
service, as well as for plans for the
increasingly popular adjunct? of polo,
are given in the Pictorial article.
