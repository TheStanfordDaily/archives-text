Professors' Part in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
It is impossible for ten men to leave the University
for the two weeks required by participation it* the
national track and field championships of the I. C.
A. A. A. A., at Harvard, without the evolving of
extra work and inconvenience on the part of a num
ber of professors. In the making up of lost time
jtust before final examinations, quite as much effort
is demanded of instructors as of the men who were
absent.
While professors have in their power to make it
almost impossible or readily practical for the ath
letes to accomplish the work of their courses after
the time missed, members of the Stanford faculty
have in the past been quite reasonable in accepting
their portion of the burden.

A Rather Significant Proposition
I he University at this time is engaged in a cam
paign for the "hirst Million" dollars, to be used solely
for raising professors' salaries. In connection with
this drive, the administration is spending thousands
of dollars for the proper kind of publicity. Natural
publicity is ten times more valuable than paid-for
publicity, and a possible victory by Templeton's men
at the Intercollegiates will do more toward bringing
the present University into a favorable light among
its alumni and friends than a dozen speaking tours by
qualified representatives.
Stanford graduates, informed by speakers that
their University is progressing and that it needs aid,
may believe it, but will accept it only coldly at best.
Did you ever notice a group of alumni around the
banquet table pick up their ears when the speaker
starts talking about football prospects for next year?
Let the track team make a showing at the intercolle
giates, and the alumni will know the University is
progressing, that its students are fighters, aijd they
will listen a great deal more readily to financial prob
lems of Stanford.
Dink Templeton, in developing the present track
team, probably did more than any individual other
than President Wilbur in promoting the success of
the endowment drive. Mr. Alumnus can now puff
out his coat, walk into his club, and take no back talk
from anyone. Should our tracksters show well at
the intercollegiates, every alumnus will be blowing
his horn for three months at least. In this frame of
mind, the grads and friends of the University are
considerably more willing to part with a check for
raising professors' salaries, erecting buildings, or
what not, than when they are asked to produce the
same negotiable instrument on cold reasoning alone.

Did you ever notice a group of alumni around the
banquet table pick up their ears when the speaker
starts talking about football prospects for next year?
Let the track team make a showing at the intercolle
giates, and the alumni will know the University is
progressing, that its students are fighters, aijd they
will listen a great deal more readily to financial prob
lems of Stanford.
Dink Templeton, in developing the present track
team, probably did more than any individual other
than President Wilbur in promoting the success of
the endowment drive. Mr. Alumnus can now puff
out his coat, walk into his club, and take no back talk
from anyone. Should our tracksters show well at
the intercollegiates, every alumnus will be blowing
his horn for three months at least. In this frame of
mind, the grads and friends of the University are
considerably more willing to part with a check for
raising professors' salaries, erecting buildings, or
what not, than when they are asked to produce the
same negotiable instrument on cold reasoning alone.
Professors' Part in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
It is impossible for ten men to leave the University
for the two weeks required by participation it* the
national track and field championships of the I. C.
A. A. A. A., at Harvard, without the evolving of
extra work and inconvenience on the part of a num
ber of professors. In the making up of lost time
jtust before final examinations, quite as much effort
is demanded of instructors as of the men who were
absent.
While professors have in their power to make it
almost impossible or readily practical for the ath
letes to accomplish the work of their courses after
the time missed, members of the Stanford faculty
have in the past been quite reasonable in accepting
their portion of the burden.
1 rack athletics, as an all-university enterprise, en
list the co-operation of the faculty as well as all other
parts of our community.
A Rather Significant Proposition
I he University at this time is engaged in a cam
paign for the "hirst Million" dollars, to be used solely
for raising professors' salaries. In connection with
this drive, the administration is spending thousands
of dollars for the proper kind of publicity. Natural
publicity is ten times more valuable than paid-for
publicity, and a possible victory by Templeton's men
at the Intercollegiates will do more toward bringing
the present University into a favorable light among
its alumni and friends than a dozen speaking tours by
qualified representatives.
Stanford graduates, informed by speakers that
their University is progressing and that it needs aid,
may believe it, but will accept it only coldly at best.
