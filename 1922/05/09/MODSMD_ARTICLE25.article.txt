# AN UNFORTUNATE ECLIPSE
## 
### 
After what has evidently been a stormy year, the
Sun Dodger, comic magazine of the University of
Washington, has been suspended by faculty action.
The reason given is that articles appeared from time
to time in the magazine with illustrations that were
not of a type suitable to be read by the college stu
dents. The precipiating cause might be said to be
a drawing showing the knees of young women, the
effect l>eing brought about bv a windy afternoon's
capricious breeze. Now, this was considered "cheap,
low, or just smart," by the authorities, and the maga
zine was banned. And this was in a state university.

Of course we are a long way from the seat of the
criminal attack upon the sensibility of the reading aca
demists and can not appreciate their shocked modes
ties as we might if we were on the spot, but after
reading all accounts of the affair in the university and
local city papers, and deducting about half for the
exaggerating that so often marks the college news in
the city paper, we come to the conclusion that some
drawings about as risque as those in Judge, Life,
C liaparral, Jester, and other good comics, must have
appeared.
The Dean of Men in the University c;f Washington
is quoted as saying that although Literary Digest and
Life have carried clippings from the Sun Dodger.
neither of the two former represent our national con
scientiousness. Perhaps not. but both the magazines
have quite a representative little coterie of readers
when you come to think the matter over. As a Seat
tle paper remarked when it spoke of the Dean's say
ing that there was nothing funny about a university,
he overlooked the possibilities in himself.
The Oregon Daily Emerald takes the side of the
committee which stopped the publication of the maga
zine. The sentiment is there that "Sunny" tended
to "degenerate into that which is cheap and low or
just smart." The attitude of the Emerald is that
Washington will be able to get along without a comic
all right after the first cry is raised over the action
of abolishment. What a simple way to Iriok at a
proposition where there is involved the abolishing of
the only visible outlet that the student body has for
its wit and humor in things picturesque and readable.
Nothing is made of any constructive benefit, but the
matter is accepted and let drop, and the Sun Dodger
is consigned to the ranks of "them that was" without
more than a passing thought.
This is an unfortunate situation at best. While we
can not offer any more than a suggestion, we think
that there should be some sort of reorganization of
the Sun Dodger, and that it should be re-established.
We are so happily placed here with the Chaparral,
the hea dof the Hammer and Coffin tribe, that we
can't see where the existence of a comic in a college
goes for anything but good. If the faculty and stu
dents in the north would get behind "Sunny" as thev
support "Chappie" here, they might look for success
rather than a dog-and-cat existence that it seems they
have endured for the last year.
