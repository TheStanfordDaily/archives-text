Henry Mack, In Friday Caboou
January 2. —How thrilled yet apprehensive I am on
entering upon my pedagogical career! Tomorrow I meet
my first class in entomology. It gives one a sense of
mastery to mold the plastic undergraduate mind. I hope
there are no women in the class; they distract from the
serious student's aim in life. Thank God, I have never
fallen into their toils.
• * ■
January 3. —The worst has come to pass. Such a
class of earnest-minded men, and one girl to spoil it all.
The usual giggling, brainless type. I must be firm lest
she be undoing of the more susceptible.
* * »
January 7.—Wonder of wonders! The girl consulted
me regarding the Muscidae domestica. Seemed to have
a real interest in my knowledge. Perhaps I have mis
judged her.
» » *
January 20. —Miss Harvey lingered after class again
and inquired about a rare specimen. Prejudiced as I
am, I must admit that she might be called attractive —
to a more impressionable person.
* * *
February 4.—The little rascal insisted on accompany
ing me on a field excursion. She was so earnest that I
couldn't refuse her. It is possible that she may be led
to higher things by the association.
* * *
February 5. —We spent a most enjoyable afternoon
in the. hills. Maragret is a wonderful hiker and has
such sharp eyes. She sees everything. She has the
latent possibilities of a good scholar, and I may be the
one to bring them out. It is worth a trial.
* * *
February 23.—Margaret's interest is growing. She
occupies a front seat and follows my lectures carefully,
while the men look out the window or doze. Her eager
face inspires me to an unwonted eloquence.
* * *
March 2.—Just returned from another excursion.
Peggy is a most engaging companion. Didn't find any
specimens, but what do I care? There will be other
days, and the insects can wait.
* * m
March 9.—Had tea in her sorority house. Peg was
lovely. So was everybody. The girls laughed continu
ously, even when I wasn't trying to be amusing. I must
cultivate small talk. I have been steeping myself too
much in work.
» * -•
March 11.' Took Peg O' My Heart to the ice cream
parlor tonight. I wish my salary were larger.
» * •
March 22.— Made out the grades today. I gave her
the only A in the class. She has a wonderful brain, and
the men are such dolts. I shall be so lonesome over
the holidays without my gay little companion.
* * *
March 4.—Words fail me! How can I indite it? She
walked by my window with one of those gross football
men and I learned it from her own lips. "Whatever
made you fall for that hayseed bug chaser?" he asked
her. And then her heartless reply, "I don't give a darn
for the old mossback, but can't you see, it was the only
way I could get by this fool course?" I must put out
this unhappy flame called life. But no—on second
thought, I will live to spite her, though I die in the at
tempt. And besides, I hace my work. —Jim Fablinger.

January 20. —Miss Harvey lingered after class again
and inquired about a rare specimen. Prejudiced as I
am, I must admit that she might be called attractive —
to a more impressionable person.
* * *
February 4.—The little rascal insisted on accompany
ing me on a field excursion. She was so earnest that I
couldn't refuse her. It is possible that she may be led
to higher things by the association.

February 5. —We spent a most enjoyable afternoon
in the. hills. Maragret is a wonderful hiker and has
such sharp eyes. She sees everything. She has the
latent possibilities of a good scholar, and I may be the
one to bring them out. It is worth a trial.
* * *
February 23.—Margaret's interest is growing. She
occupies a front seat and follows my lectures carefully,
while the men look out the window or doze. Her eager
face inspires me to an unwonted eloquence.
* * *
March 2.—Just returned from another excursion.
Peggy is a most engaging companion. Didn't find any
specimens, but what do I care? There will be other
days, and the insects can wait.

March 9.—Had tea in her sorority house. Peg was
lovely. So was everybody. The girls laughed continu
ously, even when I wasn't trying to be amusing. I must
cultivate small talk. I have been steeping myself too
much in work.

March 11.' Took Peg O' My Heart to the ice cream
parlor tonight. I wish my salary were larger.

March 22.— Made out the grades today. I gave her
the only A in the class. She has a wonderful brain, and
the men are such dolts. I shall be so lonesome over
the holidays without my gay little companion.
* * *
March 4.—Words fail me! How can I indite it? She
walked by my window with one of those gross football
men and I learned it from her own lips. "Whatever
made you fall for that hayseed bug chaser?" he asked
her. And then her heartless reply, "I don't give a darn
for the old mossback, but can't you see, it was the only
way I could get by this fool course?" I must put out
this unhappy flame called life. But no—on second
thought, I will live to spite her, though I die in the at
tempt. And besides, I hace my work. —Jim Fablinger.

January 2. —How thrilled yet apprehensive I am on
entering upon my pedagogical career! Tomorrow I meet
my first class in entomology. It gives one a sense of
mastery to mold the plastic undergraduate mind. I hope
there are no women in the class; they distract from the
serious student's aim in life. Thank God, I have never
fallen into their toils.

January 3. —The worst has come to pass. Such a
class of earnest-minded men, and one girl to spoil it all.
The usual giggling, brainless type. I must be firm lest
she be undoing of the more susceptible.

January 7.—Wonder of wonders! The girl consulted
me regarding the Muscidae domestica. Seemed to have
a real interest in my knowledge. Perhaps I have mis
judged her.
