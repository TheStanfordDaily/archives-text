# PROFESSOR TATLOCK TELLS OF SUCCESS OF HONOR STUDENTS
## 
### 
Is there any connection between dis
tinction in college work and distinction
in one's profession? Professor J. S. P.
Tatlock of the English department has
compiled a number of statistics in regard
to this question and his answer is an
emphatic "Yes," when he found from 25
'to 40 per cent of honor students distin
guishing themselves later in life.
Some of the figures on which he bases
his answer have been collected from
Pennsylvania, Harvard and Yale uni
versities. His results follow: Of 76
men who graduated with honors at Penn
sylvania between 1893 and 1898, 18 are in
"Who's Who in America." Of 79 who
graduated with high honors at Yale, 1896
to 1898, 19 or 25 per cent are in "Who's
Who." Of 75 who took highest honors
at Harvard from 1891 to 1900, 30, or 40
per cent are in "Who's Who in Amer
ica." At Harvard, at least, these men
were selected on the basis of grades in
courses.
These figures are taken from long
enough ago to give the men a good
chance to have made their mark in life,
yet not too long a time to be dead. Of
course "Who's Who" is not a natural re
liable list of those who have done well
in their careers, for many persons
omitted from it are more distinguished
than many who are in it. But it is a
good rough test of a person's ability to
gain distinction in the world and is often
ustd as a test for this purpose. The
above mentioned volume contains about
23,443 people, one to every 2000 of the
population over 24 years of age, which
is :tbout one-twentieth of one per cent.
"A class of people of which from a
quarter to nearly one-halt" distinguish
themselves in life is a very special class,"
savs Professor Tatlock.
