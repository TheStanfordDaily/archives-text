# Work of Russian Composer Is Presented at Recital
## 
### 
Simple and distinctly typical of its
composer was the Russian melody by
Tschaikowsky which was played at the
organ recital Sunday afternoon in Me
morial Church. A folk-tune forms the
basis for the melody, and it is interesting
to note that the composer first heard the
air from a carpenter who was humming
at his work.
The Overture by Handel, which Mr.
Allen played, resembles a sonata in the
form of its composition.
The program which was given Sunday
will be repeated Tuesday at 4:15 and
will be as follows:
Overture to "The Occasional Oratorio''
Handel
Andante Cantabile Tschaikowsky
Song of the Basket Weaver
Alexander Russell
The Bells of St. Anne de Beaupre
Alexander Russell
