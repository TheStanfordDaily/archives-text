## 
### 
Sequoia Union High School of Red
wood City succeeded Friday in register
ing a second win over a campus intra
mural team by defeating Team One /rom
Sequoia Hall by a 4 to 3 score in a game
played on the former's diamond. Air
tight pitching on both sides was the fea
ture of the contest, but costly errors by
the campus aggregation gave the high
school lads the game.
Joe Prior did mound duty for the Se
quoia Hall team and held the prep school
sluggers to a single blow, allowing two
walks, however, which counted in the
tally column. Milo Bird was his battery
mate. Britschgi did the hurling for the
Redwood City team and allowed only
three hits, meanwhile garnering a total
of nine strikeouts, with only three bases
on balls. Scherer did the receiving for
Britschgi and was the one man who hit
safely for Sequoia High.
The first run of the game came in the
second when Ferrewere of Sequoia High
came in on a walk after some clever base
running. There was no further scoring
until the beginning of the fifth, when the
campus team took the lead with two
runs. The high school players came back
in their half of the sixth and again took
the lead 3 to 2. In the first of the seventh
a long single by Bird of the intramural
team combined with base stealing knotted
the score at 3 all. At this time the high
school baseballers decided to make the
most of their last opportunity, the game
being only seven innings, and Went
worth, after drawing a walk, had little
difficulty in bringing in the winning tally
on a long drive by Scherer.
A return game has been tentatively set
for next Monday to be played on the
Sequoia Hall diamond.
