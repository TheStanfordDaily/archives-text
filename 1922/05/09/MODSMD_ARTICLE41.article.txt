(Following is the first reaction to
j the elimination of the bar "S" as a
1 reward for managers of sports. The
| writer takes up the side of the man
! ager in an able way. Some of his ar
! guments will perhaps meet with refu
tations from men interested in the
other side. At least this is one side
of the case. Another manager has ex
pressed himself as being just as set
the other way in a letter that he did
not want published.—The Editor.)
Mr. Editor: —In answer to your edi
torial of Tuesday, May 2, entitled,
"What About the 'S'", I wonder if you
have not given us but one single side
of a subject deserving of broader con
sideration. It is possible that the pur
port of your article is that of a sug
gestion. But the impression it made
upon me is that of an issue, on which
you took a very definite stand.
The strongest argument which you
put forth to substantiate your view
is that of breach of tradition. "Does
not seem ifi keeping with the Stanford
idea of the Block "S"; "Departing from
the traditional idea of the Stanford
"S"; "Signalizes endeavor and success
in athletic achievement"; "Has long
stood for the former and nothing else."
I group these four extracts from your
article because they may be rebutted
by a single argument. Has it ever
occurred to your mind that each year
a yell leader is awarded a block "S"
with a horn through it? Thus your
tradition has been broken prior to the
activities of the managers in regard
to the matter.
Possibly it is your view that the Yell
Leader should likewise be rated with
the debaters, as you have already
classified the managers. Or maybe
your view is that the duties of a yell
leader are more in harmony with ath
letics than are those of the managers.
That cannot lead you far. Should you
classify his "endeavors and achieve
ments" as athletic for the purpose of
justifying his present award, you will
have to place it on the ground that
the yell leader is a Mexican athlete.
Thereupon, the managers would like
wise be included in the classification.
Your article leaves the impression
that there is something peculiarly dif
ferent about the Stanford Letter, from
that of other institutions. To him who
has any pride in the institution of
which he is a member, no matter what
institution that is, is not that like
wise his view? And yet, is it not true
that Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth and
the University of California award
their varsity sport managers with the
University Letter without placing in
famy on the letter or stigma upon its
wearer?
Let us go into the pertinent merits
of the system. From my experience,
I have found certain necessary con
clusions to be true for the proper
functioning of the Student Manager
System. I—There must be a tenden
cy toward a more capable class of
managers as the system here at Stan
ford progresses. By that I do not
mean that there has necessarily been
any incapable managers up to date.
What I mean is that as the system
becomes more popular and established,
the competition will be more keen,
the system will tighten up, and only
a highly qualified person will survive
the tryout. 2. —There must be an en
tire absence of politics in the selec
tion of managers. 3. —There must be
a harmonious co-operation of efforts
between the Captain, the Coach, the
Graduate Manager, and the Student
Manager. The manager can do very

little without the co-operation of these
men. When there is friction between
the captain of a team and the manager
the manager will find himself hindered
in the carrying out of his duties. This
holds true, also, with the coach. As
to the Graduate Manager, the Student
Manager being his assistant, there
should be no cause for friction. 4.—
There must be drawn a distinct line
which points out to the managers their
precise field of work. When this is
done, there will be less cause for fric
tion with any of these with whom they
work.
Those who have the system at heart
are now working with the purpose in
view of getting the system established
on those four grounds. At the rate
which the system has established
itself here at Stanford, it will not be
long before that will have been, ac
complished. When that is accomplish
ed, the system will then be a necessary
part of our athletic life. There will
then be no cause for a criticism as to
the awards for services rendered.
While the work of the 'manager is
closely supervised by the Graduate
Manager, yet his duties are broad in
regard to the drawing up and expend
ing of the budget, in the scheduling of
games, and in the execution of games.
They are purely athletic in their inter
est, if not in nature. The services per
formed. the more service rendered to
competition. The more perfectly per
formed, the mare service rendered to
the men on the teams. Reduce the
award and you reduce the class of
men who will compete for the position.
Reduce the class of men to whom the
office appeals and you reduce the ser
vice rendered and the functioning of
the system.
Courteously yours,
ERNEST A. WILSON.
Ex-Basketball Manager, 1922.
