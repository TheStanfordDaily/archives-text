# How Do Women Charm Men?
## How Do Men Charm Women? Answer Is "Up On A Ladder" 
### 
Women! Would you know hom to
keep a man? Stephanie does. She is
an exotic Russian dancer but there is
little Bhe hasn't learned about tke
little foibles and conceits of the less
weak sex.
"Above all else, don't be constant."
she warns.
Men! Wou4d you know how to make
yourself loved by four women and yet
true to a fifth? Ellery does.

Ivo Copeland, '23, as Stephanie, and
Paul Claflin, '22, as Ellery, will reveal
these secrets at the presentation of
the 1923 Junior Opera, "Up On a Lad
der," in the Assembly Hall, Saturday
evening. One needs only to recall
the drunken chorus scene of last year's
opera, the wailing secretary of the
"Charm School," the charming Bedelia
of "Koo Koo Kubistown," the "Why
Didn't You Told Me." of the Cheerio
Revue —one needs to recall only a few
Such scenes to be assured of a riot
of laughter from the antics of this
comical pair.
Miss Copeland has been given less
of a character part than is usually
her lot, but at one point in the play

she makes herself up as a scarecrow
and does a wierd dance in her efforts
to repel the advances of the amor
ous Ellery, who has to be forced to
fall in love and then forced to fall
out. Claflin's role is similar to others
in his Stanford dramatic career. In
the words of the authors, it is that of
a "glorified dumb-bell."
The engineer of Ellery's love ven
ture is Mr. Dawson, played by Fred
Hughes, '23. "What should we oughta
do?" is his favorite expression and his
advice in either business or love is
always at hand.
But, as in any Junior Opera, plot and
characters are incidental to the music
and choruses, this year's distinction
being that there is closer connection
between the plot and lyrics than form
erly. Coach Les Seib has put the ac
cumulation of four years of experience
in acting and directing in college plays
into the development of intricate, dif
fi®ult and pleasing dance-steps for the
ponies, beauties and men.
Seat sale for "Up on a Ladder" will
open tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock
in the Administration Building, and at
Crandall's in Palo Alto.

of "Koo Koo Kubistown," the "Why
Didn't You Told Me." of the Cheerio
Revue —one needs to recall only a few
Such scenes to be assured of a riot
of laughter from the antics of this
comical pair.
Miss Copeland has been given less
of a character part than is usually
her lot, but at one point in the play

she makes herself up as a scarecrow
and does a wierd dance in her efforts
to repel the advances of the amor
ous Ellery, who has to be forced to
fall in love and then forced to fall
out. Claflin's role is similar to others
in his Stanford dramatic career. In
the words of the authors, it is that of
a "glorified dumb-bell."
The engineer of Ellery's love ven
ture is Mr. Dawson, played by Fred
Hughes, '23. "What should we oughta
do?" is his favorite expression and his
advice in either business or love is
always at hand.
But, as in any Junior Opera, plot and
characters are incidental to the music
and choruses, this year's distinction
being that there is closer connection
between the plot and lyrics than form
erly. Coach Les Seib has put the ac
cumulation of four years of experience
in acting and directing in college plays
into the development of intricate, dif
fi®ult and pleasing dance-steps for the
ponies, beauties and men.
Seat sale for "Up on a Ladder" will
open tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock
in the Administration Building, and at
Crandall's in Palo Alto.
