# FRATERNITIES REJECT MAY PLEDGING PLAN
## 
### 
The proposed system of May pledging
to go into effect next year was decisively
voted down at tlic Inter fraternity Con
ference meeting last night. When a
vote was taken on the system, with the
proviso that freshman dormitories he
constructed by the University before the
plan should operate, there were twelve
chapters against it and eleven for it.
It was proposed that the fraternities
return to the old system of rushing
whereby the freshman may he pledged as
soon as he has matriculated in the Uni
versity. This plan will he further con
sidered at the next meeting.
The meeting decided that all fraterni
ties on the campus are members of the
Interfraternity Conference, regardless of
differences as to the length of the rush
ing season, and all chapters are supposed
to send representatives to the confer
ence. The houses must live up to the
requirements of the Interfraternity Con
ference constitution, but may bid fresh
men on a later date than that set by the
current rushing rules.
Heaton Wrenn, '21, president of the
conference, read an article to the meet
ing from the Alumni News Letter of
Miami University which gave a scholar
ship report stressing the fact that the
faculty is vitally concerned with the
scholarship standing of fraternities.
There will be an interfraternity
smoker in the near future and a com
mittee will he appointed shortly to take
charge of the program.
