WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE
(P. 1. X. S.). â€”Discussing the question
as to whether training were necessary to
become a successful writer, W. W. Ells
worth, former president of the Century
Co. of New York and for forty years
a publisher, told students of the State
College of Washington that genius could
not he taught, but that one's method
could be improved, quoting the following
figures:
He declared that but 3 per cent of the
material submitted to the Century Co.
for publication is accepted, and of the
rest perhaps 7 per cent is taken by other
publishers, leaving something lige 90 per
cent unsalable manuscripts. This was
told to encourage students who, with lit
erary ambitions, had sent out manu
scripts and received only rejection slips.
Success in literature, he said, is too often
measured by publication, when it should
be measured by the quality of what is
written. Many an author has a waste
basket as his most frequent audience,
and one story published in a high-class
magazine is worth twenty in "Silly
Stories."
He gave reminiscences of his acquaint
ance with the literary great of the last
half-century, including Kipling, Mark
Twain, Roosevelt, Burroughs, C onan
Doyle, Seton-Thompson, and various
others.
