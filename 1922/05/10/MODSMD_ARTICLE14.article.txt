# TWO MID-WESTERN MEETS SCHEDULED FOR CARD SQUAD
## Injury To Kirksey May Keep Sprinter Out For Rest Of Season 
### 
Morris Kirksey, who has been
training for the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet at Harvard, tore a muscle
in starting practice yesterday
afternoon, and will be unable to
enter any 100-yard competition
this spring. While the injury
eliminates him from that event,
it is possible that he may run
the 220, which does not require
the terrific strain at the start.
The muscle is the same one
that snapped at the seventy-five
yard mark when Kirksey won the
100 title last spring. Previous to
the accident the Cardinal veteran
looked faster than he has since
1920', despite the fact that he has
only run two races in competi
tion. "Dad" Moulton believes the
cold weather was responsible for
the accident.

Stanford will enter teams in the
Western Conference meet at lowa City,
June 3, and in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association meet at Chicago,
June 17, as well as in the I. C. A. A.
A. A. championships, it was announced
by the Graduate Manager's office this
morning.
Four men—Hanner, Kirksey, Sud
den, and Williamson —will remain in
the east with Coach "Dink" Temple
ton, to compete in these two affairs.
The meet at lowa City, held under
the auspices of the Western Confer
ence, of "Big Ten," will draw leading
athletes from institutions in the Mid
dle West. The National Collegiate
Athletic Association, sponsored by
Alonzo Stagg, veteran coach at the
University of Chicago, is, in a sense,
a rival of the I. C. A. A. A. A. since
its membefs include universities in all
parts of the country.
"Tiny" Hartranft, the Cardinal
weight phenomenon, may be addod to
the quartet at a later date, although
at present he is expected to compete
at Harvard only.
The cinder path interest, which has
rather died down following the Big
Meet on April 22, will be revived next
Saturday, when the Cardinal squad
meets the Olympic Club in a return
meet on the local track. Frank Fos
ter, the Winged "O" coach, has rec
ruited several members of the Bruin
varsity who are not going east. His
roster will include Boyden, winner of
the half mile in the recent P. A. A.
meet, Krogness, former Harvard hurd
ler, who is now in good condition, and
Hunter, his distance star.
The ranks of the Stanford squad
have been thinned since the first meet
ing of the teams on March 13, when
Templeton's men trampled on the
Olympians, 92 to 39. Wilcox is out
of the pole vault. The squad picked
for the eastern "invasion," with the
exception of Kirksey and Sudden, will
qompete Saturday.

the accident the Cardinal veteran
looked faster than he has since
1920', despite the fact that he has
only run two races in competi
tion. "Dad" Moulton believes the
cold weather was responsible for
the accident.

Stanford will enter teams in the
Western Conference meet at lowa City,
June 3, and in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association meet at Chicago,
June 17, as well as in the I. C. A. A.
A. A. championships, it was announced
by the Graduate Manager's office this
morning.
Four men—Hanner, Kirksey, Sud
den, and Williamson —will remain in
the east with Coach "Dink" Temple
ton, to compete in these two affairs.
The meet at lowa City, held under
the auspices of the Western Confer
ence, of "Big Ten," will draw leading
athletes from institutions in the Mid
dle West. The National Collegiate
Athletic Association, sponsored by
Alonzo Stagg, veteran coach at the
University of Chicago, is, in a sense,
a rival of the I. C. A. A. A. A. since
its membefs include universities in all
parts of the country.
"Tiny" Hartranft, the Cardinal
weight phenomenon, may be addod to
the quartet at a later date, although
at present he is expected to compete
at Harvard only.
The cinder path interest, which has
rather died down following the Big
Meet on April 22, will be revived next
Saturday, when the Cardinal squad
meets the Olympic Club in a return
meet on the local track. Frank Fos
ter, the Winged "O" coach, has rec
ruited several members of the Bruin
varsity who are not going east. His
roster will include Boyden, winner of
the half mile in the recent P. A. A.
meet, Krogness, former Harvard hurd
ler, who is now in good condition, and
Hunter, his distance star.
The ranks of the Stanford squad
have been thinned since the first meet
ing of the teams on March 13, when
Templeton's men trampled on the
Olympians, 92 to 39. Wilcox is out
of the pole vault. The squad picked
for the eastern "invasion," with the
exception of Kirksey and Sudden, will
qompete Saturday.
Morris Kirksey, who has been
training for the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet at Harvard, tore a muscle
in starting practice yesterday
afternoon, and will be unable to
enter any 100-yard competition
this spring. While the injury
eliminates him from that event,
it is possible that he may run
the 220, which does not require
the terrific strain at the start.
The muscle is the same one
that snapped at the seventy-five
yard mark when Kirksey won the
100 title last spring. Previous to
the accident the Cardinal veteran
looked faster than he has since
1920', despite the fact that he has
only run two races in competi
tion. "Dad" Moulton believes the
