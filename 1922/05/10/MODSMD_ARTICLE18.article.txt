# INTEGRITY IS CHIEF CHARACTERISTIC OF CHINA, SAYS WILLIS
## 
### 
To pass through the heart of a country
where four thousand Chinese Christians
and some forty foreign missionaries had
recently been massacred, is an experience
which not many Americans have the
privilege of recalling. This was a part
of the trip which Professor Bailey Willis
made several years ago, and which he
described in an illustrated lecture last
evening in the Little Theater.
The journey was made on foot, and
covered some 3000 miles of country,
from the arid mountains of northern
China .through the rich central regions,
and the scenic wonders of the river val
leys in the south. Professor Willis was
thrown into contact with all classes of
people, and had an opportunity to study
their customs and characteristics, ami
methods of government.
The village unit he described as being
the most typical political organization of
provincial China. This is a self-govern
ing community, ruled over by the head
men, who are sometimes elected by bal
lot, and sometimes receive their office
through inheritance. These head men
are responsible at all times for the safety
of foreigners within their village, and
the speaker explained that at no time did
he lack evidence of their care in guard
ing him from danger.
A ready appreciation of kindness, loy
alty, and devotion under difficulty, to
gether with a profound self-respect, are
the characteristics which Professor
Willis found most conspicuous in the
Chinese lower classes. Absolute integ
rity, based upon the fear of proving unfit
to merit the worship of their descend
ants, is deep-rooted in the hearts of the
Chinese, said the lecturer, and is as un
changeable as the ancient superstitions
which have so long strangled the prog
ress of the Orient.
The official class of China has risen
from the people and has had its charac
tertistics stamped upon it by centuries
