# SIGMA NU, SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON WIN INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
The flurry of rain yesterday afternoon
interfered but slightly with the playing
of the intramural baseball games, but
the failure of several teams to show up
left only three matches. Sigma Nu
broke up its losing streak by taking one
from Sequoia Two by a score of 10 to 2.
The game was closely contested and in
teresting, with the score standing at 2 all
until the final inning, when Sequoia
seemed to blow. Sigma Nu took ad
vantage with a flock of ground balls,
which the Sequoia infielders seemed un
able to handle, and salted the game away
by putting eight runs across the platter.
Dwight and Snook were the Sigma Nu
battery, with Morrison and Londahl for
the losers.
Another 10 to 2 victory went to Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, at the expense of the
Breakers Club. Templeton, on the
mound for the losers, twirled a good
game, but his support failed him in the
pinches. Sigma Alpha Epsilon piled up
a four-run lead in the first inning, and
was never threatened. Summy's two
bagger and clever base running by Sigma
Alpha Epsilon were the features of the
game. Gifford and Draper were the
winning battery, and Templeton and
Davis worked for the Breakers.
Alpha Cbi Sigma also hoisted itself
out of a losing rut by administering an
11 to 5 defeat to Phi Kappa Sigma.
Errors told the story in this game, Phi
Kappa Sigma outhitting the winners by
five to three. Knox and Liljenstcin did
battery work for Alpha Chi Sigma, with
Moore and Creglow at the points for the
losers.
Alpha Tau Omega failed to show up
at the appointed time, and thus forfeited
to Theta Delta Chi. The Delta Kappa
Epsilon-Zeta Psi match was postponed.
This afternoon Phi Gamma Delta
meets Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Upsilon
plays Clii Psi, El Capitan tangles with
El Cuadro, and Alpha Kappa Lambda
crosses bats with Sigma Chi.
