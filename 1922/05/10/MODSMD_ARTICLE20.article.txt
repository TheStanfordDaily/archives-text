# WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?
## 
### 
We enjoy talks by men of world affairs which are
given to us in assembly from time to time. The
topics brought to us for consideration are in many
cases ones which we can put a great deal of thought
upon and which give tis a good insight into things
on the outside that we do not get in text-books.
Why, however, will men come to the campus and
talk to us for an hour on a subject previously an
nounced, without saying anything about the subject
more than a mere allusion or so? This may be
because we are conceived as being still in the stage
of the high-school pupil who cannot assimilate any
thing of real fact, and must be content to hear a
series of anecdotes and little personal adventures
.passed off as a real lecture topic. It doesn't get by,
for it doesn't mean anything.
Yesterday we were treated to this thing. A really
great man, who has been in diplomatic and public
service for many years, and is thoroughly in touch
with world-wide relations,- comes to us to tell us
about this field and the opportunities that are await
ing the college man and woman there. He takes
the ground that we are a body that will not be
interested in a presentation of facts on the subject,
and dilly-dallies around with personal incidents for
an hour and at the end of the time has gotten a very
little way with his talk as far as constructive work
goes.
By the time that we have reached the age of
college we are in shape to understand facts if they
are attractively put before us. Then why let the
idea of camouflaging go out so that we sit like a
bunch of prep school children and listen to the senti
ments such as marked the speech of the old home
town school superintendent when he told us of the
future awaiting us when we got out of high school?
Unless we get something meaty out of our assem
blies we are wasting time, both for the man who
comes here to talk to us and for ourselves, and we
haven't time to waste in most cases. We want the
assemblies and the chance to hear outside ideas, but
we want them presented to us without frills and
concisely, so that we can get the drift of the speech
and not have it overshadowed by a personality or
string of delightful but meaningless incidents.
