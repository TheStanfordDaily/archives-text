# GEORGE GONE WRONG
## 
### 
In the high wind yesterday, one of the pretty
trees at the corner of Lasuen and the County Road
was blown down. A look at the place where it
broke apart reveals that it had been mutilated by
an axe some time ago. We remember that one
night last year a youth with a bun on came along
and took an axe to the defenseless tree. It was
nearly ruined then, but remained to blossom .again.
The cut was too much for it, however, in the wind
of yesterday. Thus, a long time after the ill deed
of the cutting was done the tree falls and we lose
one of the beautiful shade trees of the avenue. It
is a pity that the youth couldn't have swung his
blade against some of the old houses or a curb
where the cuts would have been the only bad thing
to result.
Along the same line someone left a deep scratch
in the new electric piano that has been for several
days in the Union. The piano is now gone. The
piano was locked and when it could not be opened
a wanton simply took what must have been his ring
and dashed a large cross on the mahogany. If this

is an institution for morons such an act is fair
enough, but if not we ought to look out for such
an element, so that it can be placed in the corrective
institutions designed therefor.
