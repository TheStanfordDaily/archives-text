Well, seeing that the pageant was such a huge, not to
say elephantine success, we feel that the very least the
men could do would be to present something similar.
The lake makes a wonderful setting, although Cabbages
confesses that he never sat in it at this time of year.

be provided, so check all eggs at the gate.

Bandolin Gets Crowned
(An interpretative pantomime in three pants and a
snort)
The cast (a little goes a long way):
Bandolin The bonny King and England
(His mind weakening already)
Wotaguy The roughneck chief
Aulus Lo3t Who leads his king at the wrong time
Various and Sundry They act the part
(Wait till you see the whites of their eyes, men)
Octave Always one too high
(A furious dancer, though, and no bird-head even
if pigeon-toed)
m m m
Opening Scene
Enter Bandolin in a big heat. Makes a terrible scene
with Wotaguy, who is using his special can of stacomb
for liniment. Bandolin curses him roundly in vigorous
pantomime, but Wotaguy is in better training. Bandolin
hurls a lip-stick at Wotaguy, indicating that he will
have none of his lip. Wotaguy draws his sword. Bando
lin draws a blank.
Enter* the Sword Dancers. They are ahead of sched
ule, but are determined to get through with it, and
consequently break up the start of a good fight. Bando
lin, in revenge, puts red pepper on Wotaguy's sword,
whereupon the sword-swallower .chokes to death and is
carried off. Aulus Lost enters. He pantomimes deal
ing from bottom of deck, indicating that he has been
sluiced again and wants to borrow four bits. Entire
cast leaves by left wings.
• m rn
ANOTHER SCENE
Enter Various on his stomach. This shows that he
is part of an army. Sundry remains in wings, making
noises like the other part... Various sights Bandolin on
a wall. Business of gracefully arranging locks. Vari
ous makes advances. Bandolin shyly shies a lock at
Various, which hits him full on the beak and flattens
him out.
Octave enters in a sprightly manner, like a person
with a tack in his shoe. Sees how Various has fallen
for Bandolin, and is immediately churned into a rage.
Big Churn Dance. Worship of goddess Frya—Bandolin
breaks up ceremony by putting butter on hair.
Octave (infuriated pantomime): What do you mean
by that?
Bandolin (merely arm-waving):—Gwan, if I'm going
to dance I've got to have my hair straight, haven't I?
Various (getting off stomach): —My gracious! Don't
fight!
Chorus (more pantomime):—Now you've crabbed the
act!
(Both chase Bandolin into a tree, then leave by
right exit)
* * *
Grand Climax
Rival cymbals to clash in big noise classic. They do
so; but are disqualified in first five minutes of play.
Wotaguy strides in, feeling pretty proud; thinks he has
eluded Aulus. Aulus trots in, left. "Hey!" he gestures.
Wotaguy throws away last four bits, indicating that he
Wotaguy throws away last four bits, indicating that he
has no more money. Aulus Lost loses temper.
Aulus (forgetting himself): —What ho, the guard!
Silence —Wotaguy pulls a silent sneer.
Aulus (doubtfully):—What ho, the guard?
Enter guard.
Aulus —Soldiers (heavy gesture)— Fire this man. He's
the bunk.
Soldiers start to build a fire. Heated pantomime up
stage.
Enter Octave and Various. Sundry starts to enter too,
but goes back when he sees size of audience. Wotaguy
lashed to tree. Entire ensemble circles about him.
Fire Dance. Bandolin in tree, throws waterbag on
flames.
Water Dance. Calliope sounds in wings, audience
throws peanuts and applauds cake-walk. Property man
rushes in at last minute with trunks, but is chased off
again. Orchestra plays Pachyderm Glide.
Bandolin feels it is time to leave, and falls out of
tree onto Wotaguy, which breaks his bonds. Wotaguy
in dramatic scene chases Aulus Lost three times about
stage, then convinces him of innocence. Wotaguy, still
holding head where Bandolin fell on it, returns and
crowns Bandolin with sandal. Various and Bandolin
leave in haste. Octavus leaves, too, then runs back and
shouts: "That's the end."
Grand tableau, center stage.—All bow and smile, just
as if nothing had happened.

FORETHOUGHT
(By Launcelot Lump)
I do not wish to be a fish,
This lake-side life is not my dish;
I have no urge to freely surge
About the pond, nor take a splurge
In water sport such as a canoe court,
Especially the night-time sort.
But if I ever did endeavor
To queen a dame upon the water,
I'd kill with ease the simple cheese
Who turns a spotlight on the trees.

ford coaches outdid even Andy Smith when they put
eight teams into one game.

FORETHOUGHT
(By Launcelot Lump)
I do not wish to be a fish,
This lake-side life is not my dish;
I have no urge to freely surge
About the pond, nor take a splurge
In water sport such as a canoe court,
Especially the night-time sort.
But if I ever did endeavor
To queen a dame upon the water,
I'd kill with ease the simple cheese
Who turns a spotlight on the trees.

Well, seeing that the pageant was such a huge, not to
say elephantine success, we feel that the very least the
men could do would be to present something similar.
The lake makes a wonderful setting, although Cabbages

Bandolin Gets Crowned
(An interpretative pantomime in three pants and a
snort)
The cast (a little goes a long way):
Bandolin The bonny King and England
(His mind weakening already)
Wotaguy The roughneck chief
Aulus Lo3t Who leads his king at the wrong time
Various and Sundry They act the part
(Wait till you see the whites of their eyes, men)
Octave Always one too high
(A furious dancer, though, and no bird-head even
if pigeon-toed)
m m m
Opening Scene
Enter Bandolin in a big heat. Makes a terrible scene
with Wotaguy, who is using his special can of stacomb
for liniment. Bandolin curses him roundly in vigorous
pantomime, but Wotaguy is in better training. Bandolin
hurls a lip-stick at Wotaguy, indicating that he will
have none of his lip. Wotaguy draws his sword. Bando
lin draws a blank.
Enter* the Sword Dancers. They are ahead of sched
ule, but are determined to get through with it, and
consequently break up the start of a good fight. Bando
lin, in revenge, puts red pepper on Wotaguy's sword,
whereupon the sword-swallower .chokes to death and is
carried off. Aulus Lost enters. He pantomimes deal
ing from bottom of deck, indicating that he has been
sluiced again and wants to borrow four bits. Entire
cast leaves by left wings.
• m rn
ANOTHER SCENE
Enter Various on his stomach. This shows that he
is part of an army. Sundry remains in wings, making
noises like the other part... Various sights Bandolin on
a wall. Business of gracefully arranging locks. Vari
ous makes advances. Bandolin shyly shies a lock at
Various, which hits him full on the beak and flattens
him out.
Octave enters in a sprightly manner, like a person
with a tack in his shoe. Sees how Various has fallen
for Bandolin, and is immediately churned into a rage.
Big Churn Dance. Worship of goddess Frya—Bandolin
breaks up ceremony by putting butter on hair.
Octave (infuriated pantomime): What do you mean
by that?
Bandolin (merely arm-waving):—Gwan, if I'm going
to dance I've got to have my hair straight, haven't I?
Various (getting off stomach): —My gracious! Don't
fight!
Chorus (more pantomime):—Now you've crabbed the
act!

right exit)

Various and Sundry They act the part
(Wait till you see the whites of their eyes, men)
Octave Always one too high
(A furious dancer, though, and no bird-head even
if pigeon-toed)
m m m
Opening Scene
Enter Bandolin in a big heat. Makes a terrible scene
with Wotaguy, who is using his special can of stacomb
for liniment. Bandolin curses him roundly in vigorous
pantomime, but Wotaguy is in better training. Bandolin
hurls a lip-stick at Wotaguy, indicating that he will
have none of his lip. Wotaguy draws his sword. Bando
lin draws a blank.
Enter* the Sword Dancers. They are ahead of sched
ule, but are determined to get through with it, and
consequently break up the start of a good fight. Bando
lin, in revenge, puts red pepper on Wotaguy's sword,
whereupon the sword-swallower .chokes to death and is
carried off. Aulus Lost enters. He pantomimes deal
ing from bottom of deck, indicating that he has been
sluiced again and wants to borrow four bits. Entire
cast leaves by left wings.
• m rn
ANOTHER SCENE
Enter Various on his stomach. This shows that he
is part of an army. Sundry remains in wings, making
noises like the other part... Various sights Bandolin on
a wall. Business of gracefully arranging locks. Vari
ous makes advances. Bandolin shyly shies a lock at
Various, which hits him full on the beak and flattens
him out.
Octave enters in a sprightly manner, like a person
with a tack in his shoe. Sees how Various has fallen
for Bandolin, and is immediately churned into a rage.
Big Churn Dance. Worship of goddess Frya—Bandolin
breaks up ceremony by putting butter on hair.
Octave (infuriated pantomime): What do you mean
by that?
Bandolin (merely arm-waving):—Gwan, if I'm going
to dance I've got to have my hair straight, haven't I?
Various (getting off stomach): —My gracious! Don't
fight!
Chorus (more pantomime):—Now you've crabbed the
act!
(Both chase Bandolin into a tree, then leave by
right exit)
* * *
Grand Climax
Rival cymbals to clash in big noise classic. They do
so; but are disqualified in first five minutes of play.
Wotaguy strides in, feeling pretty proud; thinks he has
eluded Aulus. Aulus trots in, left. "Hey!" he gestures.
Wotaguy throws away last four bits, indicating that he
Wotaguy throws away last four bits, indicating that he
has no more money. Aulus Lost loses temper.
Aulus (forgetting himself): —What ho, the guard!
Silence —Wotaguy pulls a silent sneer.
Aulus (doubtfully):—What ho, the guard?
Enter guard.
Aulus —Soldiers (heavy gesture)— Fire this man. He's
the bunk.
Soldiers start to build a fire. Heated pantomime up
stage.
Enter Octave and Various. Sundry starts to enter too,
but goes back when he sees size of audience. Wotaguy
lashed to tree. Entire ensemble circles about him.
Fire Dance. Bandolin in tree, throws waterbag on
flames.
Water Dance. Calliope sounds in wings, audience
throws peanuts and applauds cake-walk. Property man
rushes in at last minute with trunks, but is chased off
again. Orchestra plays Pachyderm Glide.
Bandolin feels it is time to leave, and falls out of
tree onto Wotaguy, which breaks his bonds. Wotaguy
in dramatic scene chases Aulus Lost three times about
stage, then convinces him of innocence. Wotaguy, still
holding head where Bandolin fell on it, returns and
crowns Bandolin with sandal. Various and Bandolin
leave in haste. Octavus leaves, too, then runs back and
shouts: "That's the end."
Grand tableau, center stage.—All bow and smile, just
as if nothing had happened.

FORETHOUGHT
(By Launcelot Lump)
I do not wish to be a fish,
This lake-side life is not my dish;
I have no urge to freely surge
About the pond, nor take a splurge
In water sport such as a canoe court,
Especially the night-time sort.
But if I ever did endeavor
To queen a dame upon the water,
I'd kill with ease the simple cheese
Who turns a spotlight on the trees.

Well, seeing that the pageant was such a huge, not to
say elephantine success, we feel that the very least the
men could do would be to present something similar.
The lake makes a wonderful setting, although Cabbages
confesses that he never sat in it at this time of year.
