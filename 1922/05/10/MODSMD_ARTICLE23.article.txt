U. S. FAVORS ALLIED PLAN
AT GENOA
The Russian problem at the Genoa
conference was the subject of most of
the two hour meeting at the White
House yesterday. It is understood
that President Harding and his ad
visers approve of the allied stand at
the conference which would make
recognition of the Soviet government
by the United States dependent upon
assumption of her international ob
ligations and the establishment of a
stable internal government. It is
hoped that the allied plan of recog
nition can be supported by this gov
ernment otherwise the United States
will deal with the question separately.
HARDING CALLS RAILROAD
EXECUTIVES TO MEETING
It was announced at Washington
yesterday that the president has sum
moned 15 of the leading railroad exe
cutives to attend a rates conference
on May 20, at the White House. This
is the result of the investigations that
were began last November, by the
Interstate Commerce Commission. It
is understood that Harding will ask
that transportation rates be lowered
so that industries can get some relief
from the high freight tariff charges.
The Interstate Commerce Commission
cannot legally compel drastic reduc
tions, so that it is hoped that there
will be a voluntary reduction by the
heads of the leading railroads.
RUSSIA'S REPLY TO NOTE READY
The Russian reply to the allied note
is about ready for delivery and it is
expected that it will be presented to
morrow. The differences between
France and England have apparently
been softened and Belgium is not quite
so irreconcilable to the conference
plan. It is hoped that by the estab
lishment of a special petroleum coun
cil and a smoothing over of Belgium's
objections to clause seven of the allied
memorandum that the conference may
yet come to a successful conclusion.
