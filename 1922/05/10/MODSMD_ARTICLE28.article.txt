# FEDERAL STUDENTS HEAR SPEECHES AND SCHOLARSHIP REPORT
## 
### 
A plea to support the ?10,000,000
bond issue for ex-service men, to be
voted upon at the next general Cali
fornia election, was made by Coach
Harry Maloney, at a meeting of the
Federal Board Students, held last
night in the "Women's Clubhouse.
"The ex-service men," he said, "are
not asking for a gift but for a lift.
This bond issue will be a loan to them
by the state at a low rate of interest,
and will help put them on their feet
again. The money is to be used in
the financing of homes, and farms for
ex-service men who are less fortun
ate than we."
Comparison of the scholarship aver
ages of Federal Board special students
who have entered Stanford without
high school training and Federal Board
students with four years high school
credit, was made in a report of Pro
fessor Proctor, Co-ordinator. The
yearly average for the thirteen special
students who had passed highest in
the University's psychological exam
ination is 1.91; the average for a
similar number of regular students
with high school credentials passing
highest in the same examination is
1.7*. The fact that the students who
have been admitted by Stanford with
out high school preparation are equal
ing the marks of those with this pre
vious training is being used by the
F deral Board throughout the country
in persuading other colleges also tc
admit special students without high
school training. The scholarship i-ver
age for the winter quarter for the 185
Federal Board students at Stanford,
including thirty-seven special students,
was 1.45, which is slightly above the
average for the men of the University,
according to Professor Proctor.
Short talks were delivered by Elmer
Shirrell, Chief of Rehabilitation for
the Twelfth District; W. H.< Maris,
Veterans' Bureau Supervisor of Agri
cultural Training for the western
states; and T. W. MacQuarrie, place
ment officer.
