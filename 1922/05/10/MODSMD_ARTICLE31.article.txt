## 
### 
In order to accommodate those engi
neering students who may wish to enroll
in the R. O. T. C. unit in coming quar
ters, the military department has under
consideration a change in the curriculum
whereby the second-year course in the
basic work may be cut down from 3
units to 2 units, thus allowing registra
tion to many who otherwise would not
have time to devote to military training
or who would have to petition for extra
hours. Major Leroy P. Collins expects
to have a rearranged schedule in opera
tion in the fall quarter which will make
it possible for many students to enroll
who have been unable to do so on ac
count of the present schedule.
