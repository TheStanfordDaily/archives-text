# CLASS ORGANIZED TO STUDY PROBLEMS OF INDUSTRIAL WORKERS
## 
### 
A class for the study of industrial
problems will be organized at Stanford
under the direction of the Women's
Economics Cluh, Dean Mary Yost, and
the Y. W. C. A., according to plans made
at the Women's Economics Club meeting
last evening. This class, the first of its
kind to be organized in California, is the
outgrowth of a talk on "industrial Co
operation" given by Miss Clara I. Taylor
at the meeting of the Economics Club
the early part of April. Miss Taylor, as
industrial secretary of the national Y. W.
C. A., has started similar classes in the
East.
Questionnaires will be sent to all
women in the University who are plan
ning to work during the summer of 1922
and who are interested in the study of
industrial problems, asking for their co
operation in the organization of the class.
The discussions of the class will be
based mainly on the personal experi
ences of the members in order to keep
the study practical.
The Bryn Mawr experiment proved so
successful that other American colleges
will open their doors during the summer
to laborers, not to give them industrial
training but a taste of the ordinary col
lege education. The counter movement,
to bring the college men and women into
direct contact with industrial problems,
is best illustrated by the work of men
like Whiting Williams and the Denver
class for the study of the problems of
women in industry. The western states
are just beginning to realize the need of
such study and the class now being or
ganized by the Economics Club is a part
of the effort to meet the situation.
