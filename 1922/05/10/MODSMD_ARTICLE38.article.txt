# LARGE SQUAD WILL RUN FOR PALO ALTO IN TRACK CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Palo Alto Union High School will be
represented by a large track team in the
San Jose running carnival to be held in
that city Saturday. The meet is held
under the auspices of San Jose High
School, and is devoted solely to track
events.
Palo Alto won the cup last year, but
chances of duplicating the win this year
are not so good, as the local prep school
relies a great deal on her field men for
points. Palo Alto should place well up
in the running, however.
In addition to the regular track events
there will also be a number of relays,
there being scheduled a half mile relay
for the 120-pound class, a half mile for
an unlimited class, a medley, and a three
quarter-mile relay.
Cups are offered for the winning
teams of all the relays, and a big cup
for the team that places first in â– the meet.
Medals are also awarded to the men in
all events who place first, second and
third.
