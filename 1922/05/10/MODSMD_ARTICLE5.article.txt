# MEMBERS OF ZOOLOGY SOCIETY TO DISPLAY MANY CAMPUS BIRDS
## 
### 
An exhibit of the kinds of birds most
often seen on the campus will be made
Friday afternoon from 2:30 to 5 o'clock
at Jordan Hall under the auspices of the
Zoology department. Students will be in
attendance to answer questions about the
species and habits of any of the birds
displayed.
One feature of the exhibit is eggs
which form part of a large collection
made by Gavlord K. Snyder, a former
Stanford student, who presented the en
tire collection, the result of his short
life's work, to the University at his
death. A number of nests available will
show the types built by different species.
Books presenting the economic, scien
tific and popular phases of ornithology
will be displayed as suggestions of au
thentic sources for further study in any
of those fields.
Included with the bird exhibit are rep
tiles and amphibians of varieties found
about the campus. Poisonous and non
poisonous types are distinguished and
illustrated by both living and preserved
specimens.
Large numbers and diverse kinds of
birds, including the familiar sorts of
thrushes, sparrows, finches, woodpeck
ers, owls, hawks and warblers are owned
by the department. They have never
been shown to the public and this ex
hibit is the result of numerous and fre
quent questions put to the members of
the department concerning ordinary
habits and appearance of local birds.
