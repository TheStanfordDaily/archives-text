# Love By Radio Solves Problem In 1923 Opera
## 
### 
Campus queeners will be amply in
formed on the difficulties of makffig
love by such broadcast methods as
the modern radio provides, when
"Radio Love," C. W. Midgley's one
step, is- sung by Paul Claflin, '22, and
Fred Hughes, '23, in the second act
of the 1923 Junior Opera. These two
characters demonstrate the unexpect
ed interruptions which occur when
"dating a frail" by radio. While
Hughes is sending his most flowery re
gards out into the atmosphere to .the
waiting young lady, Claflin supplies
the wild waves which break in with
their "American Legion Fire" and
other distracting news. And then the
chorus increases the aerial commo
tions.
The second act of "Up on a Ladder"
which was put through a full rehearsal
last night contains a special Russian
ballet. The graceful, finished style of
dancing employed in the ballet russe
by two imps, Helen Whitney, '24, and
Foresta Hodgson, '24, is one of the feat
ures of the opera. Miss Whitney and
Miss Hodgson are well-known for their
dancing ability, both of them having
had leading parts in the Women's
Pageant, Saturday. • The imps dance
in and out during the entire produc
tion, and are always up to new pranks.
Much of the action of the opera re
volves about Dick Pershing, '21, the
kind-hearted, debonair Bill who is the
handy-man for everyone in trouble.
Bill's sweetheart, Lyle, played by
Edythe Baylis, '24, tries to reform his
excessive spirit of altruism, but only
makes a worse entanglement. Ger
aldine Watt, '24, as Margery, sings
Midgley's "Trouble," to Dick Rich
mond, '21, and proves that trouble is
followed by happiness and is really
a benefit to mankind. However, Rich
mond is a typical modern businessman
and it is very difficult to pry him out
of his matter-of-fact state of mind.
Dress rehearsal of "Up on a Ladder"
will be held tonight and tomorrow
night, but opportunity to view the
show will not be given to students.
