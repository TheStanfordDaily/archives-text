# Love By Radio Solves Problem In 1923 Opera
## 
### 
Campus queeners will be amply in
formed on the difficulties of makffig
love by such broadcast methods as
the modern radio provides, when
"Radio Love," C. W. Midgley's one
step, is- sung by Paul Claflin, '22, and
Fred Hughes, '23, in the second act
of the 1923 Junior Opera. These two
characters demonstrate the unexpect
ed interruptions which occur when
"dating a frail" by radio. While
Hughes is sending his most flowery re
gards out into the atmosphere to .the
waiting young lady, Claflin supplies
the wild waves which break in with
their "American Legion Fire" and
other distracting news. And then the
chorus increases the aerial commo
tions.
