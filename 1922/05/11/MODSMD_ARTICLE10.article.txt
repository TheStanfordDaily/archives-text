Ernst Brandsten, Director of Aqu
atic Sports at Encina Gym, will leave
Stanford within the next few days fpr
New York. He will first go to Jack
sonville, Florida, by automobile and
then to New York. At New York he
will be joined by Mrs. Brandsten.
The Brandstens will depart from
New York on June 17, for Plymouth,
England. They will visit England,
France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark,
Sweden and Norway.
Brandsten will confer with the
swimming and athletic authorities of
all these 'countries concerning the
adoption of a uniform code of diving
rules and regulations. Owing to the
great difficulty that was experienced
at the last Olympic Games at Ant
werp, by all the competitors of the
.various countries, due to the great
variation in the rules observed in
each country, the president of the
American Athletic Union has sanc
tioned Brandsten's trip to obtain new
rules.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Brandsten were
former world's champion divers and
are well acquainted with the condi
tions that exist in all European coun
tries at the present time. The re
sults of the last Olympic Games show
ed that the European divers have ad
vanced very little in their work while
great strides have been made in the
sport in the United States.
Brandsten has developed two of the
best divers of the last few years in
Clarence Pinkston, world's champion
spring board diver and Albert White,
present national champion. Brand
sten has developed a new system of
training divers at Stanford. It is
partly due to these now methods that
have been adopted by the leading or
ganizations of the coast, that the Pa
cific Coast has gained the leadership
in all diving activities. During his
trip throughout Europe he will de
scribe his methods and the apparatus
used in carrying out his system.
Mr. and Mrs. Brandsten will spend
a month or more in Stockholm, where
they formerly lived. They will return
to Stanford about September 25.
