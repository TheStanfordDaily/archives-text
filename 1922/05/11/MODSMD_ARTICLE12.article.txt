## 
### 
For the first time in the history, not
only of Stanford annuals, but of year
books throughout the country, special
painting has been introduce! in the
dedicatory section of the 1923 Quad.
The work was done by E. Spencer
Macky, who has contributed several
other paintings to the art section of
the Quad.
The e.rt section of this year's an
nual is exceptional among college
year-books in the number of paint
ings made expressly for the book by
leading western artists. Instead of
merely taking general scenes already
completed by artists, Kilpatrick has
had special views of the campus
painted for the Quad. There is in
addition a second series of six pen
and-ink sketches. Special emphasis
has been placed on cartooning, as
there are over 25 pages of caricatures,
done by campus artists.
There has been an entire regroup
ing of material in the 1923 year-book.
Four departments have been absorbed
or eliminated altogether, and five new
ones appear for the first time. The
purely statistical matter has been ab
breviated and condensed as much as
possible.
