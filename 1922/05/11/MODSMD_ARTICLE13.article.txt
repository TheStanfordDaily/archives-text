# CHI PSI, SIGMA CHI, AND EL CAPITAN WIN IN BASEBALL GAMES
## 
### 
A card of three games made up the
intramural baseball offering for yes
terday afternoon, Phi Gamma Delta
and Phi Kappa Psi postponing their
scheduled match. The feature game
of the day was Chi Psi's 4 to 3 vic
tory over Delta Upsilon, which was
anybody's match until the final put
out. Delta Upsilon drew first blood,
with a run in the first inning, but Chi
Psi came back strong and the score
stood at a 2-run tie until the third,
when Chi Psi increased its account to
four tallies. A Delta Upsilon rally in
the fourth was cut short by Wallace,
the Chi Psi first-sacker, who worked
the old "hidden-ball" trick on a Delta
Upsilon runner, catching the man flat
footed off the bag.
Delta Upsilon rallied again in the
final inning, Green's timely single driv
ing one run over the plate, but Cor
nish grounded to Art Wilcox with a
man on third and the losers fell one
short of tying the score, Reinhold
pitched a splendid game for Delta Up
silon, striking out ten men in five
innings, and allowing only three hits.
With good support he should have
won his game. Ankele, pitching for
Chi Psi, yielded five scattered hits
and whiffed five men.
El Capitan took another boost for
the pennant by defeating El Cuadro,
10 to 2. The losers were left behind
early in the game, and were never
dangerous. Anglin made a spectacular
catch of a Texas leaguer, and Howe
took batting honors with two singles
out of two trips to the plate. El Capi
tan out-hit their opponents, 12 to 6.
Wassum and Fehren made up the win
ning battery, with Robinson and Sey
mour on duty for El Cuadro.
Alpha Kappa Lambda lost a ragged
game to Sigma Chi by a 13 to 3 score.
Sigma Chi took a safe lead in the
first frame, when four of the first five
men to face Howe hit safely, includ
ing a double by Fox and a home run
by Meekin. Fox and Dallas made up
the Sigma Chi battery, with Howe and
Van Bebber working for the losers.
