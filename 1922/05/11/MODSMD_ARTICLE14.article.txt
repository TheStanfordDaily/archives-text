## 
### 
Plans are being made by Coach Ben
Wallis of the University of California
and Coach Ed Leader of the University
of Washington, to arouse greater in
terest among the universities of the
Pacific Coast tha* have facilities for
rowing. It is the hope of these men
to form an organization of Stanford
University, Rood College in Oregon,
University of Br't'sh Columbia, Cali
fornia and Washington.
If these arrangements can be made
it would be possible to hold an an
nual regatta on the Pacific Coast that
would serve to arouse the same in
terest in this section of the country
that is aroused by the Poughkeepsie
regatta in the Eafet.
At present California and Washing
ton are the only schools that are do
ing any rowing on a large scale. The
University of British Columbia is row
ing, but only on a small scale.
