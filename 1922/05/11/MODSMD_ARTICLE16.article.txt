# LANDELS TO SPEAR SATURDAY NIGHT IN NORTHERN CONTEST
## 
### 
Edward Landels, '22, left last night for
Washington State College, where he will
represent Stanford in the Intercollegiate
Speaking Contest to be held there Satur
day night between representatives of
eight Pacific Coast colleges. Oregon
Agricultural College, Washington State
College, University of Montana, College
of Puget Sound, Gonzaga University,
Whitman College, Pacific University,
and Stanford are the eight competitors
for the two prizes of $75 and $25 which
have been offered by Washington State
College.
Landels has had considerable forensic
experience. He was a member of the
Stanford team that met the University
of Oregon this year in the Tri-State, and
was on the Euphronia Society team that
defeated St. Mary's a short time ago. He
was alternate on this year's Joffre team,
and the unanimous winner of the speak
ing contest held in April by the division
of Public Speaking. In Saturday night's
competition his subject will be "A Plea
for Sanity in Intercollegiate Athletics."
The chances for a Stanford victory
Saturday night are good, according to
Professor J. G. Emerson, debating coach.
"Landcl's subject is one of interest to
any college audience, and his extempo
raneous, offhand style of delivery is ef
fective and pleasing."
The judges for the contest are to be
chosen jointly by Whitman and Wash
ington State College.
