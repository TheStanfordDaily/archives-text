# PUBLIC PROTECTION SEEN BY SULLIVAN IN PROPOSED BILL
## 
### 
"The fundametal principle involved
in the Sample Bill is tl\e protection
of the public," declared Judge Jere
miah Sullivan of San Francisco yes
terday before the Law School in sup
porting the Sample Bill, which is to be
voted upon at the coming state elec
tion. This bill prohibits the practice
of law by any except duly qualified,
licensed lawyers.
In those professions and businesses
that come in vital contact with the
health, safety, and well-being of the
individual, the state has found it
necessary to protect the individual by
the issuance of licenses and permits
to only those qualified in the vocation
which they wish to enter, according
to the speaker. Among those who
must secure a license or a permit are
doctors, dentists, pharmacists, certi
fied accountants, and real estate con
cerns. A lawyer's relation with his
client is one vitally connected with the
latter's happiness and wealth, with
the welfare of his family and depend
ents; and for that .reason, declared
the speaker, the state should prohibit
as it does by the Sample Bill the prac
ticing of law by any other than a
regularly qualified lawyer.
Judge Sullivan declared that the
center of opposition to the Sample
Bill is the Trust division of the Cali
fornia Bank Association, which wish
es to serve as legal advisers to their
clientele. But the lawyer-clerk, the
paid attorney, retained by the bank
can not advise the bank's customers
honestly and impartially; for, said the
speaker, he is attempting to serve at
the same time "two masters," the
bank who pays him and the customer
who is seeking liis advise.
