# FRENCH PLAYS ARE EFFECTIVELY GIVEN

The time-honored custom of much
chivalry, whereby a slap from a lady
calls for a kiss in return, forms the
th me of "La Main Leste," the Labiche
comedy which Le Cercle Francais
presented last night in the Little The
atre.
The plot hinges upon a misunder
standing between Madame Legrainard,
wife of the Parisian Modiste, and Mon
sieus Kegalas, a young painter. When
the lady's temper gets the better of
her she gives vent to her feelings in
the most emphatic manner. This
causes the offended gentleman to de
mand satisfaction from the lady's hus
band, and finally gives rise to a love
affair between the daughter of the
family and young Regalas. After
further complications, that are only
overcome when the parents learn of
the financial standing of the suitor,
which he takes pains to disclose at the
critical moment, a complete reversal
of Madame Legrainard takes place and
the fond parents bless the union of
the young people.
Winifred Johnston, '22, took the
part of Madame Legrainard, and car
ried out the characterization in a most
effective manner. Miss Johnston has
taken part in plays which Le Cercle
Francais has produced in past years,
and has appeared in similar roles at
the University of Illinois, where she
was a student last year.
Dorothy Elfving, '22, as the demuro
daughter of the family, carried her
part with genuine charm, and naive
ness. Miss Elfving has also been cast
in former plays which the club has
produced, and has been a student in
the French Lycee at Tours for the
past year.
The most difficult character part of
the comedy was well taken by Paul
Herkman, '22, who played Monsieur
Legrainard. His make-up as the
stout, bald-headed shop-keeper, to
gether with his interpretation of the
lines brought many laughs.
Mildred Walter, '22, and Alexander
Briggs, '23, completed the cast. Both
parts were well taken, and gave evi
dence of careful training, and a
thorough understanding of the char
acters which they had been chosen
to portray.
In addition to the French comedy of
Labiche, a tragedy by Montaya, "Mon
sieur Purgon," which was written to
illustrate an incident in the life of the
French dramatist Moliere, was pre
sented by the company from the Gaite
Francais in San Francisco.
Andre Ferrier, who played Moliere,
the leading character, gave an excep
tionally fine interpretation of his dif
ficult role. The feeling and emotional
rendering which he displayed, classed
him at once as one of the greatest im
personators of tragedy on the coast.
The other two parts, that of La
Forest, the servant which was played
by Mme. Ferrier, and M. Purgon, taken
by Le Chevalier Fallon, balanced the
play most effectively.

chivalry, whereby a slap from a lady
calls for a kiss in return, forms the
th me of "La Main Leste," the Labiche
comedy which Le Cercle Francais
presented last night in the Little The
atre.
The plot hinges upon a misunder
standing between Madame Legrainard,
wife of the Parisian Modiste, and Mon
sieus Kegalas, a young painter. When
the lady's temper gets the better of
her she gives vent to her feelings in
the most emphatic manner. This
causes the offended gentleman to de
mand satisfaction from the lady's hus
band, and finally gives rise to a love
affair between the daughter of the
family and young Regalas. After
further complications, that are only
overcome when the parents learn of
the financial standing of the suitor,
which he takes pains to disclose at the
critical moment, a complete reversal
of Madame Legrainard takes place and
the fond parents bless the union of
the young people.
Winifred Johnston, '22, took the
part of Madame Legrainard, and car
ried out the characterization in a most
effective manner. Miss Johnston has
taken part in plays which Le Cercle
Francais has produced in past years,
and has appeared in similar roles at
the University of Illinois, where she
was a student last year.
Dorothy Elfving, '22, as the demuro
daughter of the family, carried her
part with genuine charm, and naive
ness. Miss Elfving has also been cast
in former plays which the club has
produced, and has been a student in
the French Lycee at Tours for the
past year.
The most difficult character part of
the comedy was well taken by Paul
Herkman, '22, who played Monsieur
Legrainard. His make-up as the
stout, bald-headed shop-keeper, to
gether with his interpretation of the
lines brought many laughs.
Mildred Walter, '22, and Alexander
Briggs, '23, completed the cast. Both
parts were well taken, and gave evi
dence of careful training, and a
thorough understanding of the char
acters which they had been chosen
to portray.
In addition to the French comedy of
Labiche, a tragedy by Montaya, "Mon
sieur Purgon," which was written to
illustrate an incident in the life of the
French dramatist Moliere, was pre
sented by the company from the Gaite
Francais in San Francisco.
Andre Ferrier, who played Moliere,
the leading character, gave an excep
tionally fine interpretation of his dif
ficult role. The feeling and emotional
rendering which he displayed, classed
him at once as one of the greatest im
personators of tragedy on the coast.
The other two parts, that of La
Forest, the servant which was played
by Mme. Ferrier, and M. Purgon, taken
by Le Chevalier Fallon, balanced the
play most effectively.
