# CLEANING UP A PLEDGE
## 
### 
1 he first part of next week there will he a con
certed effort to clean up the remainder of the endow
ment pledge from the Stanford campus. This is no
new campaign but the winding up of the work that
was undertaken by the student body at the opening of
the campaign in February. At that time there was
a four-day period set for the drive, and, true to their
word, the ones in charge of the campus drive closed
it at the end of four days.
In the rush of events that were on at the time
, there was not time enough to meet all of the students
â–º on the campus, and of the portion off the campus many
were not interviewed at all. These have not had a
chance to contribute to the fund that was so well
started by the ones who did respond at first. It is to
reach these that the revival will be made in the next
* week.
.With Alumni Day coming the last of next week it
is imperative that we have all of our quota that is
to be subscribed finished by then so that we can point
with pride to the amount when we refer, to the alum
ni, of our part in the raising of the endowment. At
the present we have only sixty-five per cent of the
total amount pledged. This is not a record to be
proud of if it were not for the fact that the amount
has been turned in by only a like percentage of the
student body. When the entire part of the students
have been reached it is easy to see the whole amount
subscribed. This one hundred per cent, or a nearly
perfect score, is what we need to turn in at the end
of our effort here.
A clean-up squad has been named to conduct the
interviewing of those who have not been approached
so far. They can not work successfully unless they
have the support of the rest of the campus. If every
one will get behind the squad and help where it
is needed this clean-up may be made in a hurry, and
at the time the alumni come back we will have a record
to show them of which we may well be proud.
