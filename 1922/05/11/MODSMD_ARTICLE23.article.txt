# FRATERNITY AND UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Along with the work of all that is going on to
better the conditions in the University there arises
considerable discussion as to whether the fraternities
are doing all they can to further this move, or if they
are not acting too much for themselves without look
ing first to the welfare of their institution. There is a
responsibility that the fraternity owes to the Univer
sity, and this is more than that of the individual be
cause of the number of individuals represented in
each group. A great deal of talk has been spent upon
the subject as to just how the groups should go about
fulfilling the obligation owed to the University.
The primary thing which motivates the establish
ment of a fraternal group on any campus is for the
most part social purpose. Right, for it gives a chance
for congenial companionship that is not possible with
out some sort of organization. But the most impor
tant functions of the fraternity are with reference to
the concerted good that it can do the college, and to
the molding of the men whom it pledges so that
they will be urged by the older men to go into activi
ties to the benefit of the University and themselves.
In how much the latter two things in the life of a
fraternity outweigh the first or social function, de
pends the existence of the fraternity as an organiza
tion.
After the man has been brought out for some

activity is when the greatest help may be given him.
He is one of a group which is supposedly interested
in him making a success. This is where the group
action comes in. His interest may lag in the activitv
and then he can be spurred on to further effort by the
judicious use of a little flattery, which all humans
like, or some word of praise for his efforts. This all
works to the good of the university for which he
is doing his job. This is easier to do in the frater
nity than in any other sort of a group, or at least it
should be if the fraternity is doing its part in amount
ing to what it should.
It is said, and perhaps with justice, that just like
human beings some groups are willing to sit back on
reputation or on their social side and let things take
their course. Others are honestly doing what they
think is for the best. Unless there is concerted action,
however, there never can be the success which may
be demanded. Why? Because without complete co
operation there never can be full efficiency. This is
not meant to be taken as any advocate for political
combinations, but only in lines of work that will help
the University here to solve the problems which are
confronting the administration. It is this spirit of
aid which will, if properly shown, do more than any
thing to justify and solidify the existence of the fra
ternity as a necessary Stanford institution.
