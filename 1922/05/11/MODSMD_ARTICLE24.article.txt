Henry Mack, In Friday Caboost
A young theologian from Yale,
Maintained (though thrown into jail)
That the Bible was wrong;
He was sure all along
That 'twas Jonah that swallowed the whale.

Speaking of whales, think how seasick the poor
creatures must get.

Cabbages has severe inward disturbances around the
* stomach at the sound of the numerous bright comments
of the That's-The-Bee's-Knees ilk. If the Bee's Knees
and the Gnat's Eyebrows and kindred anatomical ob
jects of interest excite such admiration, we take great
pleasure in presenting the following:
The Elephant's Adenoids. For sheer magnitude of con
ception, this idea has the Kitten's Tonsils completely
outclassed.
• * *
The Earth-Worm's Arm-Pits. What could be more
intriguing than an allusion to those rare equipages?
The Canary's Appendix. Far more personal and
touching than any reference to any physical character
istics of an uninteresting Gnat or Bee.

The- gentleman in the last row rises to ask if a base
hit has anything to do with clipping from behind. He
says that from reading the sporting news he gathers
that that is about as base a hit as he can think of.

Our sympathy is extended the Old Lady who brought
her small grandson out to the Zoology Building to see
the Lions and the Elephants.

ROMANCE!
"Yes," she vWiispered, "I will always keep a warm
place in my heart for you." "And an empty place in
your head," he replied, under his breath. He nearly
broke his jaw talking under his breath, for he had a
powerful breath and it was a heavy load on any jaw.
"But I cannot go to the Prom with you," she added. He
was dumb with astonishment. His room-mate would
have said that he must be pretty much astonished all
the time, if that was so. He thought of throwing him
self into the lake, but he had his good clothes on. He
thought of carbolic acid, but he remembered that he had
a weak stomach. He thought of hanging himself, and
changed the subject hurriedly. Finally he decided to
cut his Mechanics Class and get hurled out of school
Then she'd feel sorry.
And why did he contemplate all these dreadful things?
Yes, brother, you are right. HE HAD ALREADY
RENTED HIS DRESS SUIT!

No, Heloise, vegetarians don't all necessarily have
cauliflower ears.

"Another Big Hole in Russian Treasury," reads the
headline. They ought to call the Russian mint Life-
Savesky. And if you want to know why they should
call it that, it's because Life Saver is the Mint with the
Hole. Bring flowers if you want to.

Every time they bury a humorist they don't neces
sarily run a joke into the ground.

The end of the streetcar line never unravels.

"Don't hold that against me," remarked the man to
the burglar, speaking of the butcher knife.

We see by the papers that Sun Dodger has been sus
pended for printing pictures featuring feminine knee
boles. Coles Phillips can be thankful he went to Yale.

In announcing the suspension an esteemed faculty
member of the northern institution made the remark
that a university offered no field for a publication based
on humor. Washington evidently has no Bawl Out.

In view of what happened to Sun Dodger for por
traying the shins of young ladies, it is announced that
in the future Cabbages will positively refuse to run any
hosiery ads in this column.

"This is a hard life," as a diamond drill is fond of
saying.

Convict—Durn it!
Ditto—Huh?
Convict—This is a serial, and I get shot at sunrise.

YOU CAN KISS ME, KID, BUT DON'T STEAL MY
CHEWING GUM.
