important facts:

may attend the camp.
That early application is important in
order that the young man applying may
not lose the opportunity by the late ar

amusements, medical service and medi
cines, and travel expenses.

That the age limits are from 17 to 27,
except that veterans of the World War
are admissible up to 35.
That it is the sincere desire of the War
Department that every section of the
state have at least one representative at
tliis camp.
That only young men of high moral
character and standing in the community
are desired.
That the young, man's time will not all
be taken up in work; but abundant, in
