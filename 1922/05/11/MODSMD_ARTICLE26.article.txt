"Resolved, That the University
should adopt the plan of evening as
semblies," was the question discussed
at a meeting of Nestoria Debating So
ciety, yesterday evening. The system
of holding assemblies in the evening
instead of during class hours, has been
tried with success at other colleges,
and many propose its adoption at
Stanford.
Leland Stanford, '24, and Horace
Dryden, '24, took the affiirmative of
the question, while the negative was
upheld by Emmet McCaffery, '24, and
Kenneth Gardner, '23. The affirma
tive team pointed out that the adop
tion of the evening assembly plan
would present an opportunity for dis
cussion by the student body of all
affairs of vital university interest. It
was further suggested that the success
of the plan at the University of Wash
ington at least merited a trial here.
The negative contended that evening
assemblies would be poorly attended
at Stanford and that it would be im
possible to get a live student discus
sion of University problems.
Following the debate a short busi
ness meeting was held.
