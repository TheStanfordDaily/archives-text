# STUDENT REHEARSALS OF FAUST BEGIN SOON
## 
### 
The rehearsals for the Stanford stu
dents, who will take part in the per
formance of "Faust" to be given in the
stadium June 10 as a part of the open
air grand opera series, will hegin next
week under the direction of Warren D.
Allen.
The students will furnish a large pro
portion of the chorus for the production,
and is made possible by the fact that last
year Stanford gave "Faust" in concert
form under the direction of Organist
Allen, At that time, there were about
one hundred in the chorus and probably
sixty or seventy of them will be available
again this year.
However, for the performance in the
stadium, it will be necessary for the sing
ers to learn the music so that it can be
sung in Italian and without books. Con
sequently rehearsals will have to start at
once. Tuesday evening, May 16, Allen
will hold a rehearsal for the men, for
the women on Wednesday evening, and
for the entire chorus Thursday evening.
This schedule will be maintained
throughout the remainder of the month,
so that the chorus will be prepared to
take part in the performance which is
under the direction of Marola.
Much interest is being evidenced in
the enterprise since it will give an op
portunity to Stanford students to take
part in grand opera singing with Marti
nelli, Rothier, and others under the train
ing of Marola and under the stage di
rection of Agnini of the Metropolitan
Opera House.
