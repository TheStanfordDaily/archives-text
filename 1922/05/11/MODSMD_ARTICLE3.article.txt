## 
### 
"Professionalism must be erased
from college athletics if they are to
endure," said Andy Smith, football
coach of the University of California,
in an article which appeared recently
in a Chicago newspaper. "I believe
that in most cases the college restric
tions are perfectly proper. It is up
to the athlete to be loyal to himself
and his college."
To eradicate professionalism, Smith
advises summer baseball with the stu
dents being allowed to play for com
pensation, but not *with team affili
ated with organized baseball.
"Every college player who is worth
while, and who needs the money,
wants to play during the summer,"
Smith continues. "A great many do
it. taking precautions to protect their
amateur standing by being paid for
other work, which merely covers uo
the baseball compensation. Permit
summer baseball, by placing the ath
letes on their honor during the col
lege season."
