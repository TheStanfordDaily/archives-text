# BASEBALL PRACTICE RESUMED; TRAINING FOR HONOLULU TRIP
## 
### 
Varsity baseball practice has been re
sumed as the trip to Honolulu comes
closer, and Coach Seay is working bis
men three times a week. Following the
last game with California, no practice
was held for two weeks, but the lay-off
has been abandoned now so that the team
will be in the best shape possible by the
time it leaves for its summer trip.
Just what men will make up the team
when it goes to Honolulu is not yet cer
tain, as some of those picked originally
may be unable to go. The first plans
called for fourteen players and the man
ager to make the trip.
During the rest of the quarter some
games will be played with outside teams,
to supplement the regular practice which
is getting the horsehide tossers back into
mid-season form. Practice is being held
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.
