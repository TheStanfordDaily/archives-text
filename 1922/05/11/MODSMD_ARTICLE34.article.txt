# Sophomores Should Get Cord Measurements Now
## 
### 
All sophomores who have agreed to
purchase cords under the class plan and
will want them for summer wear, are
asked to have their measurements taken
now at the Encina Haberdashery.
Class Manager Charles White states
that measurements can be taken today,
tomorrow and Saturday. As these cords
arc cut only to order everyone must have
his own measurements taken.
