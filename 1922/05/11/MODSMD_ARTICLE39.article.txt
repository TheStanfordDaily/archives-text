# GLEE CLUB MAKES TRIP TO LOS GATOS
## 
### 
Thirty members of the Stanford Glee
Club journeyed to Los Gatos last night
for their first concert since the successful
spring tour. Besides the regular pro
gram given by the club, Marshall Mon
roe, '23, entertained with a tenor solo,
which was followed by a cello solo by
George Kelso, '25. Arnold Bayley, '23,
and Richard Malaby, '23, who were
scheduled on the program were unable
to attend the concert, due to rehearsals
of the Junior Opera.
The trip was made by a special inter
urban car which left the Stanford Book
store at 7 o'clock and returned the mem
bers later. According to present plans
concerts may be given on Alumni Day
and at the Lane Hospital in San Fran
cisco before the end of the quarter.
