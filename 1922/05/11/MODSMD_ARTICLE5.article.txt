# Flood Of Organdie Swamps Stage In "Up On A Ladder"
## 
### 
Yards and yards of organdie—of all
colors and shades, ranging from deep
green to purest white—made up into
dresses of varying designs. No, they
will not be found in the windows of any
Palo Alto merchant, but upon the As
sembly Hall stage when the women's
choruses appear in "Up On a Ladder"
Saturday night.
For the first time the ponies and beau
ties will dance, not in flimsy importations
from San Francisco costumers, but in
attractive campus attire—organdies for
the first act and evening dresses for the
second. However, in the ballet russe
which opens Act Two, the sixteen
women will appear in gay Russian peas
ant costumes. These and the ballet
dresses worn by the two dancing imps,
Foresta Hodgson and Helen Whitney,
will be the only imported clothing.
