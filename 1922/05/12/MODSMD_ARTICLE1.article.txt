# JUNIOR WEEK FESTIVITIES, OPENED BY LAKE CARNIVAL, WILL FINISH WITH TOMORROW NIGHT'S OPERA
## Intricate Chorus Work Demonstrated In Final Dress Rehearsal Of 1923 Spectacle Yesterday 
### Robert Edwards, '24 
Getting others out of predicaments is Bill Banning's avocation, while
the aim of Larry and Ellery is to buy the ballet studio of Boukowski.
Complications arising from the circumstances form the plot of "Up On a
Ladder," the 1923 Junior Opera, which will conclude Junior Week, tomor
row evening.
When the curtain rises upon the first act, Lyle is in the center of an
ever-widening iris "Up On a Ladder" singing the song of that name. Bou
kowski's dancers in colorful sport clothes gather around the ladder and greet
Lyle with "Hello." "Up On a Ladder" written by Dick Malaby and C. W.
Midgley's "Trouble" are the theme-songs of tlife opera. The first opens

and closes Act One, and is combined
in the grand finale with "Trouble"
which is repeated three or four times
during the production.
Bill, the handy-man of everyone in
trouble, is engaged to Lyle who wants
her lover's attentions devoted to her
and not scattered promiscuously on
anyone who needs help. When Lyle
begins to rescue people on her own
account entanglements occur which
are only solved in the final scene. And
to add to the difficulties, the imps
are always appearing at the wrong
time.
Two persons are doing their best
to purchase Boukouski's studio, and
aparently for much different reasons.


The complications brought about by these three couples form the plot of the
1923 Junior Opera. They are from left to right: Ivo Copeland, Paul Claf
in, Geraldine Watt, Dick Richmond, Edythe Baylis, and Dick Pershing
Larry must get the studio or lose
his job with his father's firm, and in
case of the latter he could not marry
Marjorie Boukouski, his fiancee. His
rival is Ellery, the "glorified dumb
bell," who worships Stephanie, a Rus
sian dancer, and desires the studio
so that he may be near her. Ellery
is aided by Mr. Dawson, the know-it
all business man who prefaces his in
structions with "now what should we
oughta do?"
Finally the dumb-bell succeeds in
purchasing the studio from Boukouski
who wants freedom from business so
that he may dream and create his
ballet dances. While Marjorie and
.Larry are lamenting the chances to
"buy butterfly wings" on $I.Bo', a tele
gram from Larry's dad punctures the
gloom clouds.
The chorus work in this year's
opera is unusually finished and in
tricate, and the innovations in dance
steps introduced by Coach Lester
Seib are sure to be appreciated. One
of the big hits of the show is in the
first act when the "organdy" chorus
sings "Trouble" with Marjorie carry
ing the high notes of the melody. In
the second act organdies are replaced
by evening dresses.
Perhaps the real feature of Xhe
opera is the Russian ballet scene
which opens the second act. As the
iris gradually widens the white-haired
Ivan is telling the imps how he taught
their mother ballet dancing many
years before. When the pale blue
lights suffusing the stage give way to
brighter ones and the cymbals crash,
the men's chorus enters and does a
Russian (lance with Cossack boots
stamping to the slow melody of the
"Ballet Russe."
Members of the pony and beauty
choruses come in, clothed in bright
peasant costumes with sparkling head
dresses. As they sing, they go through
the spirited movements of the Russian
dance. Framing this shifting mass of
color is the salon of the Boukouski
Studio. Carpeted stairs lead up to
a great paneled window on either side
of which are draperies of varied hues
blending into a harmonious color
Scheme, and in and out among the
ponies and beauties the two imps
dance their specialty number of the
"Ballet Russe."
The opening scene is the roof garden
loggia of the Boukowski Studio, and
the second act is laid in the salon of
the studio. Both sets are products of
Gordon Davis' Theater Workshop, and
are being designed by Ed Farmer, '23,
with art work and properties by Chry
sella Dunker. Lighting effects were
worked out by Carroll Hudson, '22,
chief electrician.
