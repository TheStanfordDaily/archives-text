# JUNIOR WEEK FESTIVITIES, OPENED BY LAKE CARNIVAL, WILL FINISH WITH TOMORROW NIGHT'S OPERA
## Intricate Chorus Work Demonstrated In Final Dress Rehearsal Of 1923 Spectacle Yesterday 
### Robert Edwards, '24 
Getting others out of predicaments is Bill Banning's avocation, while
the aim of Larry and Ellery is to buy the ballet studio of Boukowski.
Complications arising from the circumstances form the plot of "Up On a
Ladder," the 1923 Junior Opera, which will conclude Junior Week, tomor
row evening.
When the curtain rises upon the first act, Lyle is in the center of an
ever-widening iris "Up On a Ladder" singing the song of that name. Bou
kowski's dancers in colorful sport clothes gather around the ladder and greet
Lyle with "Hello." "Up On a Ladder" written by Dick Malaby and C. W.
Midgley's "Trouble" are the theme-songs of tlife opera. The first opens

and closes Act One, and is combined
in the grand finale with "Trouble"
which is repeated three or four times
during the production.
Bill, the handy-man of everyone in
trouble, is engaged to Lyle who wants
her lover's attentions devoted to her
and not scattered promiscuously on
anyone who needs help. When Lyle
begins to rescue people on her own
account entanglements occur which
are only solved in the final scene. And
to add to the difficulties, the imps
are always appearing at the wrong
time.
Two persons are doing their best
to purchase Boukouski's studio, and
aparently for much different reasons.


The complications brought about by these three couples form the plot of the
1923 Junior Opera. They are from left to right: Ivo Copeland, Paul Claf
in, Geraldine Watt, Dick Richmond, Edythe Baylis, and Dick Pershing
