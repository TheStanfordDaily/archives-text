# GRADUATING FOREIGN MEN STUDENTS TO BE GUESTS OF CHAMBER
## Foreign Trade Companies to Entertain at Commercial Club Next Wednesday Eve 
### 
The graduating foreign students of
Stanford have been invited to a banquet
of the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce at the Commercial Club in San
Francisco, on next Wednesday night at
7. All the big foreign trade firms in
San Francisco will be represented at
the dinner and each will have for its
guest one or more'of the Stanford men.
The purpose of the banquet is to estab
lish an acquaintance between the men
of the foreign countries and the trade
firms which are represented in the coun
tries.
W. F. Brewer, secretary of the Cham
ber of Commerce, yesterday telephoned
that, while all of the men had been sent
personal invitations, there should be no
misunderstanding as to the nature of
the banquet. It will be entirely informal
and will be only to have the men here
given a chance to meet the representa
tives from the big companies trading
abroad, so that each may better under
stand the attitude of the other to their
mutual advantage.
The acceptances arc not being sent in
as fast as had been anticipated and that
is perhaps due to some misunderstand
ing. All students from foreign coun
tries are invited to the banquet if they
are in the graduating class for this year.
Mr. Brewer would appreciate a prompt
response to the invitation, so that ar
rangements can be made in advance.
