# CARDINAL TRACKMEN TO COMPETE AGAINST OLYMPIC CLUB TEAM
## Varsity Weakened by Loss of Sprinters; Winged "O" to Enter Fifteen-Man Squad 
### 
Cardinal trackmen, weakened by the
loss of the sprint stars, Kirksey ami
Sudden, will battle some fifteen of
Frank Foster's Olympic Club athletes
tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock on the
local oval in a post-season track meet.
Eight of the ten-man squad picked to
represent Stanford in the eastern cham
pionships will compete in the final meet
before they start their transcontinental
journey next Friday. Sudden, on ac
count of a death in the family, is un
able to run, and it is still a matter of
doubt whether he will make the trip
East.
Outside of those two, Templeton's
squad is practically intact. The Olympi
ans, on the other hand, will be augment
ed by a few runners from the University
of California, who are not included in
the Bruin squad of fifteen to the I. C.
A. A. A. A. meet. In the absence of
Sudden and Kirksey, Wright, the quar
ter-miler, will probably try his hand at
the sprints, with "Blink" Williamson a
possibility for the 220.
Since the time for record-breaking
lias apparently passed, main interest to
morrow will center in the times ancl
distances made by the eight Cardinals
who will go to the I. C. A. A. A.. A.
meet.
Several of the Cardinal and Olympic
runners have private scores to settle.
Krogness, the Winged "O" hurdler, was
beaten by Falk when the teams met
March 18, but lie turned the tables, on
the Cardinal man in the 120 event at the
P. A. A. meet. Orlo Hayes has a chance
to break the tape in the 220 low hurdles,
running that event in :25 1-10 seconds
last night in practice.
Daly will have his hands full when
he tackles Elmer Boyden, the prep
school star, in the 880, even though
Boyden only got third when he appeared
liere before, joe Pyne, the Olympic
"handy man," will do most of the work
in the sprints ancl hurdles, although in
the barriers he will be supplemented by
the lanky "Red" Drew.
Glenn Hartranft, still suffering from
a sore arm, but nevertheless able to
heave the shot and discus out a consid
erable distance, is to meet McGurn and
McEarchen, the Olympic weight men.
The Cardinal entry put the shot 50 feet:
the last time he met these men in dual
competition, and he may repeat tomor
row.
There will be a little competition in
several of the events, as some of Tem
pleton's men have "trained down," and
the Olympic forces are limited to about
fifteen.

liere before, joe Pyne, the Olympic
"handy man," will do most of the work
in the sprints ancl hurdles, although in
the barriers he will be supplemented by
the lanky "Red" Drew.
Glenn Hartranft, still suffering from
a sore arm, but nevertheless able to
heave the shot and discus out a consid
erable distance, is to meet McGurn and
McEarchen, the Olympic weight men.
The Cardinal entry put the shot 50 feet:
the last time he met these men in dual
competition, and he may repeat tomor
row.
There will be a little competition in
several of the events, as some of Tem
pleton's men have "trained down," and
the Olympic forces are limited to about
fifteen.
Cardinal trackmen, weakened by the
loss of the sprint stars, Kirksey ami
Sudden, will battle some fifteen of
Frank Foster's Olympic Club athletes
tomorrow afternoon at 2 o'clock on the
local oval in a post-season track meet.
Eight of the ten-man squad picked to
represent Stanford in the eastern cham
pionships will compete in the final meet
before they start their transcontinental
journey next Friday. Sudden, on ac
count of a death in the family, is un
able to run, and it is still a matter of
doubt whether he will make the trip
East.
Outside of those two, Templeton's
squad is practically intact. The Olympi
ans, on the other hand, will be augment
ed by a few runners from the University
of California, who are not included in
the Bruin squad of fifteen to the I. C.
A. A. A. A. meet. In the absence of
Sudden and Kirksey, Wright, the quar
ter-miler, will probably try his hand at
the sprints, with "Blink" Williamson a
possibility for the 220.
Since the time for record-breaking
lias apparently passed, main interest to
morrow will center in the times ancl
distances made by the eight Cardinals
who will go to the I. C. A. A. A.. A.
meet.
Several of the Cardinal and Olympic
runners have private scores to settle.
Krogness, the Winged "O" hurdler, was
beaten by Falk when the teams met
March 18, but lie turned the tables, on
the Cardinal man in the 120 event at the
P. A. A. meet. Orlo Hayes has a chance
to break the tape in the 220 low hurdles,
running that event in :25 1-10 seconds
last night in practice.
Daly will have his hands full when
he tackles Elmer Boyden, the prep
school star, in the 880, even though
Boyden only got third when he appeared
liere before, joe Pyne, the Olympic
"handy man," will do most of the work
in the sprints ancl hurdles, although in
