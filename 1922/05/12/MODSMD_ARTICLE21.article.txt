# MANY RETURNS OF THE EVENING
## 
### 
"Really a Carnival,'' is the characterization for
last night's music and fireworks show on Lagunita
Lake. To the L'? 23 class goes a lot of credit for
having arranged and so successfully carried out
such a fine evening's entertainment. As it happened,
a more beautiful night could not have been chosen,
and when the lights shown on the lake and silhou
etted the canoes against the green banks of the lake
there was a scene hard to rival at any resort.
The water carnival last night brought out a num
ber of things that are needed up at the Lake. It
conies to us forcibly that the improvement of the
lake bottom is becoming more and more imperative.
Also the tremendous demand for canoes brings out
the fact that we should have more in stock. The
ones that are for rent are not in too good repair
and, while quite safe, are somewhat uncomfortable.
There is no reason why Lagunita cannot be made
the place of frequent entertainments like the one
last night, and jf it is, the lake will be more and
more popular and there will be a need for more
equipment. It pays for itself, all it needs is capital
to start. Run by the University, a rent service could
be made successful and the profit would keep the
stock in good repair.
