# ON A BUSINESS BASIS
## 
### 
Athletic equipment used by the members of teams
during the year must be turned in at once. Many of
the suits and shoes which have been issued in the
past season are still in the hands of different men
and can not l>e gotten hold of to be cleaned and
renovated for the coming season. This is holding
up the work of the Graduate Manager and ruining
the clothes and other equipment in a large number
of cases where the dirtv stuff is allowed to lie
crowded into the bottom of a locker.
Abuse of the trust that operated in respect to
most of the goods given out to athletic organizations
has made it necessary for the Manager's Office to
take the matter up with the Comptroller's depart
ment. In the future it will likely be that all equip
ment drawn by a man will be charged to him on the
books of the University, and a failure to turn in at
the end of the season will result in the student being
barred from further attendance. The managers of
the sports are to take care of the loose equipment
that is of a non-personal nature, and when any of
the goods of one man is taken while one of the man
agers is on the job, the man will have some excuse.
This will be the only thing that will save him. This
system, while seeming hard, will really make it
easier all around. It will be possible to outfit more
men and to keep the equipment in a lot better condi
tion.
