The publications of Stanford University arc de
pendent for most of their advertising support upon
the little business community of Palo Alto. Aside
from syndicate advertising, which is obtained
through national advertising agencies, there is a
negligible quantity that comes from any other source
than the Palo Alto merchants.
Many of the merchants do not think that the ad
vertising matter they run in the Daily and the other
campus periodicals is a paying proposition. But
with the rate prevailing in the Daily the advertising
does pay. There is a strong argument for the Palo
Alto merchants, however, in the fact that a good

deal of the student trade is not offered to them at
all. If they cannot give what is desired, then they
are satisfied, but they want and rightly have a
chance. They support our papers, our magazines,
pay for the printing of programs, and are behind
us with athletic displays at, the time we are having a
meet with other colleges.
They merit as much support as we can give them
in return. When trading, let them know that their
financial support of our papers is appreciated and
that their ads are the things that brought you to
their store. This co-operation will be for the benefit
of both sides and that is what we are after.
