Dangerous Dan, or a Mystery of the North.
(Showing that it is not always wise to get rough at the
wrong moment.)
Dangerous Dan was a lighting man, from the cold and
bitter lands,
He packed a gun and he killed for fun, he had blood
stains on his hands,
He was full of hate, and in hot debate, he had slain full
many men,
And he cared no whit, though he swing for it, he would
track big prey to its den;
'Neath the midnight sun, where the hunters run, he was
feared for his fiery hate,
He was shunned by men, and his dirty den, at the foot
of Copperplate,
Was a grisly place, where a woman's face, was a thing
it had never seen.
But those Northern laws, never laid their claws, on this
monster so bad and mean.
In the Northern town, when the men come down, from
their lonely killing toil,
You will find them soon in the first saloon, and they love
to mix into the moil!
All but Qangerous Dan; when he spoke to a man, is was
only to rail or curse, n
And they oft declared that no woman dared loose his
tongue or the strings of his purse.

It was nearly eight, so the men relate, when the stranger
swaggered in,
And he called a toast that was like a boast, to the
miners near the bar,
"I'm away from home, yet from Maine to Nome men
have heard of me near and far,
I have yet to find men of any kind who I could not
hypnotise,
For my will is strong, it does not take long till they fall
under spell of my eyes."

It was ten or more when the half-closed door was flung
back with a mighty kick,
It was Dangerous Dan; when he saw the man who was
doing his terrible trick
Call for just one more, he pushed 'cross the floor, and
he said with a scowl and a curse,
"You have doped these fools, who are led like mules, yet
I'll stake the gold in this purse,
That your damned green eyes can not hypnotize a man
from the Copperplate!"
"I will take that bet, and you'll yet regret that you
cursed at a man of Fate."
For a half an hour, with his utmost power the man of
Fate labored and sweat,
He waved his hands but his terse commands were not
heeded by Dan as yet.
With a face of flint, and a murderous glint in his black
and beady eyes
Dan watched his foe, and he seemed to know that the
stranger had spoken lies.
As he reached for his gun, the crowd yelled "Run!" and
they fought their way to the door,
They'd not got away, when a voice called "Stay!"—
there was Dan stretched out cold, on the floor.

The Man of Fate caught the outbound freight, the night
he defeated Dan,
He has left no trace, but in Dan's grim 112 ce, was the
look of a beaten man,
When he left the shack, where they brought him back,
from the trance they had found him in.
Those men who opine he was genujne, and the men who
declare he was "tin,"
Wish the man had stayed, or at least delayed, till they'd
found how to liynotize,
But the Man of Fate had another date —and Dan knows
that he acted wise,
As Dan pats his gun, 'neath the midnight sun, how he
curses the stranger's trick,
Next time he'll fire 'fore the stranger's ire, disables
poor Dan with a kick.

"Room for Five Hundred in Northern Lumber Camps,"
says headline. This is verily an age of women's op
portunities.

"Well, that was surely cutting defeat," remarked the
militant tack in the sufferer's snoe.

No, Mike—the streetcar line couldn't unravel—look
at the ties in it.
