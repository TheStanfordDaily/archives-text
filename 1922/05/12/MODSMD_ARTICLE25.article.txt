THE RUSSIAN MEMORANDUM
Russia's reply to the Allied ulti
matum was made public yesterday
evening. It rejects the proposed sys
tem of mixed tribunals for the resti
tution of confiscated property, declar
ing that this involves a violation of
Russia's sovereignty. The Soviets do
not alter substantially their attitude
toward the Russian indebtedness. They
insist on cancellation of war debts
and will agree to recognize other ob
ligation only on condition that the
Allies make reciprocal concessions. A
new committee of experts is suggested
to consider the financial question more
carefully.
Though the reply is conciliatory in
tone, it is not the categorical accep
tance that France demanded. The
proposal of another delay is a direct
defiance of the Belgium-France-Japan
combination. To be consistent France
must withdraw from the conference
or break off negotiation with the Sovi
ets. In this case the liberal countries
of Europe would be free â€¢to come to
their own terms unhampered by
France. The French in the conference
were the pricipal obstacle to a Rus
sian settlement.
