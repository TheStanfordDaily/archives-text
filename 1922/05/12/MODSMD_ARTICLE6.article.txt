# SPRINGTIME IS THEME OF PROM DECORATIONS
## Admittance to Dance Will Be By Tickets; Roughs to Be Admitted After 10:30 
### 
Everything is in readiness for the
Junior Prom to be held tonight in the
Pavilion. Decorations, lighting effects,
and scenery are all in place, after a hard
week of industrious co-operation be
tween the committee in charge of the
dance and the members of the 1923
class. Admittance to the Prom may be
had by tickets only.
A mass of brilliant streamers form a
gabled canopy over the center of the
dancing floor, while at both sides
streamers of many different hues hang
from the false ceiling. An elaborate in
direct lighting system has been worked
out by Edward Farmer and Charles
Watson. From overhead a battery of
colored reflectors will play upon the
entire room, allowing the light to filter
through the streamers of springtime col
ors. Underneath the balconies little al
coves have been curtained off, making
enjoyable resting and meeting places.
Whitmer's ten-piece orchestra will fur
nish the music for the Prom and will
be located at the center of the north
wall of the building. A sounding board
has been constructed to carry the music
to every part of the floor, and other
appropriate arrangements for the music
have been made.
Fan-shaped programs were distrib
uted at the Bookstore this afternbon.
There will be ten dances, with two ex
tras, a section of the fan being reserved
for each dance. Supper will be served
between the fifth and sixth dances.
Roughs will be admitted after 10:30.
The Water Carnival on Lagunita last
night started Junior Week. The band
opened the program with numbers,
while later in the evening a stringed
quartet and a special double quartet
from the Glee Club gave several selec
tions. Fireworks and the burning of
the huge '23 concluded the performance
for the evening.
