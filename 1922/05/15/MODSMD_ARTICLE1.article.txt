# CARDINAL TRACK TEAM WINS OVER OLYMPIC SQUAD
## Williamson Wins Quarter Mile in 49 Seconds Flat; Smith Runs Half Mile in 1:57 4-5 
### 
Midsummer heat had a good effect on
cinder path representatives of the Stan
ford varsity, Olympic Club and Stanford
freshmen, who set up more-than-respect
able marks in six of the twelve events
run off in the informal competition Sat
urday afternoon.
The final score was: Stanford var
sity 70, Olympic Club 25, Stanford fresh
men 7, although individual times and
distances meant far more than the totals
pf the teams. Frank Foster brought
down seven Winged "O" athletes, but
most of his stars were left at home.
A1 Smith's time of 1 :57 4-5 in the 880-
yard run headed the marks. The. 1925
distance runner beat Daly, of the varsity,
to the tape by a yard, with Scofield third.
Smith's time is the best made on the
coast this season for the two-lap event.
"Blink" Williamson tore off the 440 in
49 seconds flat in the heat, closely fol
lowed by his teammate, Judah. The race
started at the end of the straightaway
and finished on the far turn, thus elim
inating one of the curves. The quarter
will be run on the same kind of course
at the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet.
Lane Falk and Krogness met in the
hurdles for the third time. The Olym
pian beat the Cardinal captain-elect in
the highs by a step, and the watches
caught him in 15 3-5 seconds. Falk,
later in the afternoon, ran the 220-yard
low hurdles in 24 1-5 seconds, with Hayes
not far behind. The sprints were more
or less makeshift affairs, with all of the
first string Cardinal men out.
Hartranft, who tore a muscle in his
leg last Thursday afternoon, limped on
to the field and won the shot put and
discus with mediocre marks. His leg,
according to the doctor, will be well in
two weeks.
The results:
880-yard run —Smith (SF) first, Daly
(S) second, Scofield (S) third. Time,
1:57 4-5.
440-yard dash—Williamson (S) first.
Judah (S) second, Saxby (O) third.
