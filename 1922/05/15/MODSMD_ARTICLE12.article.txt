# Fire In Delta Chi House Saturday Extinguished By Volunteer Firemen
## 
### 
A blaze starting in a canvas motor
cycle cover lyiug against the Delta
Chi house, set fire to the shingles
and vines, about 10 o'clock, Saturday
night. The blaze was extinguished
by men from the Alpha Tau Omega
and Theta Delta Chi houses, who used
door mats and a garden hose to beat
down the fire.
It is thought that a cigarette tossed
onto the greasy cover caused the blaze.
There was no one in the house at the
time, nor had there been for at least
an hour. The damage was slight, due
to the prompt work of the amateur
firemen, and was covered by insurance.
