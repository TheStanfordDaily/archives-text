# LANDELS IS WINNER IN INTERCOLLEGIATE SPEAKING CONTEST
## 
### 
Edward Landels, '22, was awarded
first place and a prize of $75 in the In
tercollegiate Speaking Contest held last
Saturday night at Washington State Col
lege.
Eight Pacific coast colleges were rep
resented in the competition. Representa
tives were present from Oregon Agricul
tural College, Washington State College,
University of Montana, College of Puget
Sound, Gonzaga University, Whitman
College, Pacific University, and Stan
ford. Each speaker was allowed from
eight to fifteen minutes for his original
address, which was on whatever topic he
desired.
Landels chose for his subject "A Plea
for Sanity in Intercollegiate Athletics,"
which is the subject that won for him the
local speaking contest recently held un
der the auspices of the division of Pub
lic Speaking. According to Landels, it
is one of the peculiar functions and spe
cial responsibilities of the American col
lege to keep alive a love of active par
ticipation in athletic games for its own
sake. It is the duty of the college, he
maintained, to promote the finer ele
ments in athletics, and it is not its func
tion to provide a spectacle or produce a
wonder group of athletic specialists.
Landels contended that intercollegiate
athletics have ceased to be contests
played for the sport of playing and as
wholesome diversions from other pur
suits, and have become contests of ex
pensive organizations, contests of im
personal, hired experts, contests of com
parative financial resources. This pres
ent-day tendency common to practically
all American universities will spell ulti
mately, if not curbed, the doom of inter
collegiate athletics, according to Landels.
The gist of his speech was embodied in
an article by him that appeared in the
May "Pictorial."
It is planned to extend the member
ship in this speaking competition to in
clude practically all of the universities
west of the Rocky Mountains. The place
of next year's contest has not yet been
decided.
