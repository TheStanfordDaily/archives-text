# Prom And Lake Sports Draw Big Attendance
## 
### Robert Edwards, '24 
The complete absence of "novel deco
rations and sympathetic lights at the 1923
Junior Prom, Friday night, was greatly
appreciated by those wlio attended the
social climax of the year. A canopy of
pastel shaded streamers overhead and
potted plants around the sides made an
effective decorative scheme. Whitmer's
nine-piece orchestra left little to be de
sired in the matter of music, and several
special numbers in which two saxophones
and a cornet carried through the melody
were termed by many dancers as "knock
outs."
A feature of the affair was the effect
of the new pavilion sounding board,
which prevented the sounds of the in
struments from being distributed pro
miscuously over the large building, and
directed the music toward the dancers.
Although there were more than three
hundred couples on the floor, the largest
number that has ever attended a Junior
Prom, there was plenty of spacc for the
dancers. The floor had been thoroughly
swept with the use of dampened sawdust
and then sprinkled sparingly with boric
powder. This method resulted in a floor
that was not too slippery.
About 11 o'clock a supper was served
from the kitchenette which opens onto
the dancing floor. Seven hundred people
were served in twenty minutes. The re
freshments consisted of fruit salad in a
grapefruit shell, small cakes, and straw
berry mousse. During the supper Don
Hutton gave a solo on the violin.

Ideal spring weather for the Lake
Sports at Lagunita Saturday morning
helped to bring out a large crowd to wit -
ness this part of the Junior Week pro
gram. A considerable number of the
spectators appeared in swimming outfits
and held swimming, diving, and splash
i ing contests of their own in between the
program of scheduled events which filled
the morning.
The judges were "Dink" Templeton
and Morris Kirksey, who, together with
their retinue of aids, were carried about
the lake in the University's lifeboat,
which was propelled by Kirkscy's expert
sculling.
In the men's swimming contests the
individual star of the day was "Hi"
Wooster. '21. After capturing the 75-
yard free-style swim from some speedy
'competitors, several of whom were on
his trail, he went around to the far side
of Lagunita and began the swim across
the lake. He won this event by a large
margin, thereby adding a $5 merchandise
order from Roos Brothers to the $2.50
order of Crandall's which he won in the
dash.
Charles Watson, '23, took first in the
