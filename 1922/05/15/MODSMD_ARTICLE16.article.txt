# Prom And Lake Sports Draw Big Attendance
## 
### Robert Edwards, '24 
The complete absence of "novel deco
rations and sympathetic lights at the 1923
Junior Prom, Friday night, was greatly
appreciated by those wlio attended the
social climax of the year. A canopy of
pastel shaded streamers overhead and
potted plants around the sides made an
effective decorative scheme. Whitmer's
nine-piece orchestra left little to be de
sired in the matter of music, and several
special numbers in which two saxophones
and a cornet carried through the melody
were termed by many dancers as "knock
outs."
A feature of the affair was the effect
of the new pavilion sounding board,
which prevented the sounds of the in
struments from being distributed pro
miscuously over the large building, and
directed the music toward the dancers.
Although there were more than three
hundred couples on the floor, the largest
number that has ever attended a Junior
Prom, there was plenty of spacc for the
dancers. The floor had been thoroughly
swept with the use of dampened sawdust
and then sprinkled sparingly with boric
powder. This method resulted in a floor
that was not too slippery.
About 11 o'clock a supper was served
from the kitchenette which opens onto
the dancing floor. Seven hundred people
were served in twenty minutes. The re
freshments consisted of fruit salad in a
grapefruit shell, small cakes, and straw
berry mousse. During the supper Don
Hutton gave a solo on the violin.

Ideal spring weather for the Lake
Sports at Lagunita Saturday morning
helped to bring out a large crowd to wit -
ness this part of the Junior Week pro
gram. A considerable number of the
spectators appeared in swimming outfits
and held swimming, diving, and splash
i ing contests of their own in between the
program of scheduled events which filled
the morning.
The judges were "Dink" Templeton
and Morris Kirksey, who, together with
their retinue of aids, were carried about
the lake in the University's lifeboat,
which was propelled by Kirkscy's expert
sculling.
In the men's swimming contests the
individual star of the day was "Hi"
Wooster. '21. After capturing the 75-
yard free-style swim from some speedy
'competitors, several of whom were on
his trail, he went around to the far side
of Lagunita and began the swim across
the lake. He won this event by a large
margin, thereby adding a $5 merchandise
order from Roos Brothers to the $2.50
order of Crandall's which he won in the
dash.
Charles Watson, '23, took first in the
50-yard back-stroke swim and received
a $2.50 merchandise order from the Uni
versity Pharmacy. Michael Gibbons, '25,
had little trouble in winning the fancy
diving events by doing a series of well
executed dives off the high springboard."
His prize was a $2.50 order donated by
Christy Rhodes.
Dorothy Foster, '25, and Doris Steven
son, '22, tied in all of the women's events
—the 75-yard free-style swim, the 50-
yard back-stroke, and the diving contest.
They are privileged to divide as they
wish the prizes offered for these events,
which consist of a pair of bathing shoes
donated by Smith's on the circle, Roos
Brothers' $5 order, and a two-pound box
of candy donated by Polos.
In the canoe races examples of excel
lent paddling were emphasized when
several incidents of poor steering caused
some of the contestants to stage a good
natured brawl in the middle of the lake.
Two of the canoes insisted on holding
contiguous positions during most of the
race. The course for all the races
started and finished at the boathouse,
and extended around the pipe in the
middle of the lake. The men's canoe
race was won by R. E. McDonald, '23,
and Ray Doughty, '23, the prize being a
$5 merchandise order from Widaman's.
A team composed of McDonald and
Emily Wardman, '22, ran away from the
rest in the mixed canoe race—prize, five
pound box of candy given by Weingart
ner.
The most enjoyable events of the pro
gram from the spectators' point of view
was the canoe tilting contest in which
five blood-thirsty teams participated. On
several occasions referee Templeton had
a hard time deciding which pair stayed
in the boat the longest. Two canoe:?
were eliminated, leaving three teams to
compete. These were John Graves and
Taylor, Dick Fullerton and
W. L. Williams, and Norman Cleaveland
and Leo Fox. The last had the best
combination of strenuous tilting and
clever paddling work and took home
Frazer's $2.50 merchandise order.

race was won by R. E. McDonald, '23,
and Ray Doughty, '23, the prize being a
$5 merchandise order from Widaman's.
A team composed of McDonald and
Emily Wardman, '22, ran away from the
rest in the mixed canoe race—prize, five
pound box of candy given by Weingart
ner.
The most enjoyable events of the pro
gram from the spectators' point of view
was the canoe tilting contest in which
five blood-thirsty teams participated. On
several occasions referee Templeton had
a hard time deciding which pair stayed
in the boat the longest. Two canoe:?
were eliminated, leaving three teams to
compete. These were John Graves and
Taylor, Dick Fullerton and
W. L. Williams, and Norman Cleaveland
and Leo Fox. The last had the best
combination of strenuous tilting and
clever paddling work and took home
Frazer's $2.50 merchandise order.
The complete absence of "novel deco
rations and sympathetic lights at the 1923
Junior Prom, Friday night, was greatly
appreciated by those wlio attended the
social climax of the year. A canopy of
pastel shaded streamers overhead and
potted plants around the sides made an
effective decorative scheme. Whitmer's
nine-piece orchestra left little to be de
sired in the matter of music, and several
special numbers in which two saxophones
and a cornet carried through the melody
were termed by many dancers as "knock
outs."
A feature of the affair was the effect
of the new pavilion sounding board,
which prevented the sounds of the in
struments from being distributed pro
miscuously over the large building, and
directed the music toward the dancers.
Although there were more than three
hundred couples on the floor, the largest
number that has ever attended a Junior
Prom, there was plenty of spacc for the
dancers. The floor had been thoroughly
swept with the use of dampened sawdust
and then sprinkled sparingly with boric
powder. This method resulted in a floor
that was not too slippery.
About 11 o'clock a supper was served
from the kitchenette which opens onto
the dancing floor. Seven hundred people
were served in twenty minutes. The re
freshments consisted of fruit salad in a
grapefruit shell, small cakes, and straw
berry mousse. During the supper Don
Hutton gave a solo on the violin.

Ideal spring weather for the Lake
Sports at Lagunita Saturday morning
helped to bring out a large crowd to wit -
ness this part of the Junior Week pro
gram. A considerable number of the
spectators appeared in swimming outfits
and held swimming, diving, and splash
i ing contests of their own in between the
program of scheduled events which filled
the morning.
The judges were "Dink" Templeton
and Morris Kirksey, who, together with
their retinue of aids, were carried about
the lake in the University's lifeboat,
which was propelled by Kirkscy's expert
sculling.
In the men's swimming contests the
individual star of the day was "Hi"
Wooster. '21. After capturing the 75-
yard free-style swim from some speedy
'competitors, several of whom were on
his trail, he went around to the far side
of Lagunita and began the swim across
the lake. He won this event by a large
margin, thereby adding a $5 merchandise
order from Roos Brothers to the $2.50
order of Crandall's which he won in the
dash.
Charles Watson, '23, took first in the
50-yard back-stroke swim and received
a $2.50 merchandise order from the Uni
versity Pharmacy. Michael Gibbons, '25,
had little trouble in winning the fancy
diving events by doing a series of well
executed dives off the high springboard."
His prize was a $2.50 order donated by
Christy Rhodes.
Dorothy Foster, '25, and Doris Steven
son, '22, tied in all of the women's events
—the 75-yard free-style swim, the 50-
yard back-stroke, and the diving contest.
They are privileged to divide as they
wish the prizes offered for these events,
which consist of a pair of bathing shoes
donated by Smith's on the circle, Roos
Brothers' $5 order, and a two-pound box
of candy donated by Polos.
In the canoe races examples of excel
lent paddling were emphasized when
several incidents of poor steering caused
some of the contestants to stage a good
natured brawl in the middle of the lake.
Two of the canoes insisted on holding
contiguous positions during most of the
race. The course for all the races
started and finished at the boathouse,
and extended around the pipe in the
middle of the lake. The men's canoe
race was won by R. E. McDonald, '23,

Dorothy Foster, '25, and Doris Steven
son, '22, tied in all of the women's events
—the 75-yard free-style swim, the 50-
yard back-stroke, and the diving contest.
They are privileged to divide as they
wish the prizes offered for these events,
which consist of a pair of bathing shoes
donated by Smith's on the circle, Roos
Brothers' $5 order, and a two-pound box
of candy donated by Polos.
In the canoe races examples of excel
lent paddling were emphasized when
several incidents of poor steering caused
some of the contestants to stage a good
natured brawl in the middle of the lake.
Two of the canoes insisted on holding
contiguous positions during most of the
race. The course for all the races
started and finished at the boathouse,
and extended around the pipe in the
middle of the lake. The men's canoe
race was won by R. E. McDonald, '23,
and Ray Doughty, '23, the prize being a
$5 merchandise order from Widaman's.
A team composed of McDonald and
Emily Wardman, '22, ran away from the
rest in the mixed canoe race—prize, five
pound box of candy given by Weingart
ner.
The most enjoyable events of the pro
gram from the spectators' point of view
was the canoe tilting contest in which
five blood-thirsty teams participated. On
several occasions referee Templeton had
a hard time deciding which pair stayed
in the boat the longest. Two canoe:?
were eliminated, leaving three teams to
compete. These were John Graves and
Taylor, Dick Fullerton and
W. L. Williams, and Norman Cleaveland
and Leo Fox. The last had the best
combination of strenuous tilting and
clever paddling work and took home
Frazer's $2.50 merchandise order.
