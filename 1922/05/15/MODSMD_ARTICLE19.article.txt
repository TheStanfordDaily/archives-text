# THE
						NEXT WEEK END
## 
### 
Junior Week having come and gone, and with
credit to the 1923 Class, we have the next week-end
to get ready for. On just how well we prepare the
day for the alumni depends the good time that they
will have while here. This is the first time that we
have gone into this Alumni Day program with an
idea of having so many hundred back on the farm.
Each one of us must co-operate with committee chair
men to the greatest possible extent to do anything that
is asked of us in the matter of arranging tours, re
unions, and the like.
The Labor Day, Wednesday, at the convalescent
home, the organized forces will clean up the rubbish
and weeds around the children's home. Dud De-
Groot has his committees organized all right, and
there will be plenty of work for all. Only by having
a thousand out at the home can all of the work be
done in the afternoon.
