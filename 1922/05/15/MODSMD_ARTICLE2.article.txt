# Wilson's Palo Alto and Campus Stores to Hold Sale For Class of 1924
## 
### 
Another "Sale Day" has been an
nounced by the sophomore class as a
continuation of the campaign being car
ried on to clear up the class debt. A
week from Tuesday, May 23, is the date,
and both of Wilson's candy stores are
the places.
Proceeds above a certain amount will
go into the '24 treasury, so that those in
charge are hoping for a hot day and a
lot of loose change. Devotees of the
soda counter are urged to repress their
thirst and save up their cash until next
Tuesday, and then let go with a steady
rush all day, both at the campus $tore
and in Palo Alto. This is of the same
nature as the sale carried on a few weeks
ago at Wideman's, by which the class
treasury was materially aided.
