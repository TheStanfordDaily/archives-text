# WE MISSED SOMETHING
## 
### 
A lot of us wore the red or white flowers yesterday,
and sent home letters or telegrams to the mothers
who have done so much for us. A good many who
do not often go to church went this Sunday as a spe
cial tribute to the mother. Most of us expected to
hear something about our mothers whom we adore
or of whom we cherish memories.
It was rather a disappointment not to have heard
anything said about the subject for which Sunday had
been set aside.
