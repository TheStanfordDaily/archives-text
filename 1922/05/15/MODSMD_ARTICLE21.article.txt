When Charlie Erb and some of his friends swiped
a machine the other night and went for a ride they
rated a big write-up. Why? Not because of the
sin of having committed a crime by unlawfully pos
sessing themselves of the auto, but,because Charlie
Erb, football captain, Big "C" man, and so forth, was
the offender. Verily, the wants of the public are
peculiar when the mere being of an athlete will
change a little police-court incident into a big story
of front-page prominence.
