utes of study are interrupted just at the time when
it may mean that something will be lost and can not
l)e gotten hold of before the 8 o'clock in the morning.
If the time of closing is 10 o'clock, why not leave
everything quiet until that hour, otherwise the closing
time may just as well be shoved up to 9:50.
