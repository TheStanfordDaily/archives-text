Four bottles of port wine, said to be at least fifteen
years old, were dug up the other day from in front of
one of the buildings at Oregon University. The
bottles had apparently been put there some time when
the ground was opened for the laying of a pipe
line that was recently dug up.
It would be a terrible thing if such a find was made
around here. Wc would have the ground in such a

precarious condition in a clay or so that life and limb
would be unsafe in walking. If there had been a few
like "finds" made in the vicinity of the Stadium last
summer we venture the opinion that there would
have been little excavation for the contractors to do.
