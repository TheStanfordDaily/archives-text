(Follow these directions and you will never go wrong,
and very seldom right. Eat in safety as well as in union)
* • •
(Come in the front door —'the back door should be
used for special luncheons only—and hang your hat
on the rack and your coat on your hat. Don't hang
around yourself, though. Go direct to the table, and
picking out thenearest chair, kick it to be sure it isn't
roped together. Having found one that is fastened
by nails, sit down in it, putting your feet under the
table, your hands in your pockets, and you eyes on
the menu. Take a reef in your belt. If you haven't got
one, take a half hitch around your wish-bone with your
suspenders. Call the waiter —anything except George.
All waiters are not named George. They might be wait
resses. Georgette? Oh, no —not at all! Enter waiter).
W. —Anything today, sir.
Customer —Not yet—l only got up an hour ago. Is
there anything good on the menu?
W. —I haven't seen it printed, sir. Would you like any
real coffee?
C. —I would! But I guess this coffee here will have
to do instead. How much is it?
W.—Ten cents, sir. Hot, fifteen cents.
C. —Give me some chocolate. How much is that hot?
W. —I don't know sir. I've never seen it that way
around here. (Exit waiter).
(While he is gone, prepare for the battle. Go down
the menu and check off everything that costs less than
twenty-five cents. Then check off, from what is left,
all that you don't want to eat. Having thus checked
off everything, get a new menu and, with a strip of ad
hesive tape, carefully cover up the price list. Then you
can order in comfort).
Enter waiter with chocolate. Break the thin crust
of frost on top and begin drinking, taking care not to
get your teeth chilled).
C. —Say, waiter, bring me a typographical error, will
you? ,
W. —Yezzir, yezzir. (Exit waiter. While he is gone,
look around the room, picking out the fire escapes.
As you are on the ground floor, this should not take
long, and is a harmless diversion. (Enter waiter.)
W. —Sorry, sir but there ain't no typographical er
rors, the cook says.
C. —How's that? I see one here on the menu! Say,
what's this here 011 the bill of fare.
W. (inspecting closely)— Don't know, sir, but looks
like gravy. I'll wipe it off.
* * •
(Lapse of time indicates eating or attempting to eat,
as the food may be.)
* * *
(Follow these directions closely and you will have
no trouble in avoiding payment of your bill. As soon
as you see the waiter approaching with the check, fall
into a severe epileptic fit. Roll upon the floor, carefully
avoiding table legs, and, between groans, scream out,
"The meat done!! Oh —wow-wow-ow-ow-ow!! The meat
done it!! The meat done it!!" Rather than have any
more scandal, the management will either brain you
with an axe or throw you out the back d00r... In either
case you don't have to give the cashier anything, except
a mean look with your mind's eye.)
• • *
A bellboy (oh gosh, what a pity!)
Who had captured the belles of the city.
Couldn't hear the loud bell
At the crossing—oh, well
Now the churchbells are chanting thjjir ditty.
' " "?~ r
" " A gent, who seems dumb when he stares
Tried to clamber one night up his stairs,
He was tight—and contrite —
But he couldn't see right,
.J •
And they're still patching up all his tears.
A musical genius named Stagg,
Made his rag hits when back from a jag.
But he dickered —when licquored—
With dice, and was slickered.
Now a rag-picking job is his fag.
A terrible crazy-house curse
Is due to all this kind of verse.
The mind that invents it
Can sense it —repents it—
And knows that there's nothing much worse.

by nails, sit down in it, putting your feet under the
table, your hands in your pockets, and you eyes on

one, take a half hitch around your wish-bone with your

W. —Anything today, sir.
Customer —Not yet—l only got up an hour ago. Is
there anything good on the menu?
W. —I haven't seen it printed, sir. Would you like any
real coffee?
C. —I would! But I guess this coffee here will have
to do instead. How much is it?
W.—Ten cents, sir. Hot, fifteen cents.
C. —Give me some chocolate. How much is that hot?
W. —I don't know sir. I've never seen it that way
around here. (Exit waiter).
(While he is gone, prepare for the battle. Go down
the menu and check off everything that costs less than
twenty-five cents. Then check off, from what is left,
all that you don't want to eat. Having thus checked
off everything, get a new menu and, with a strip of ad
hesive tape, carefully cover up the price list. Then you
can order in comfort).
Enter waiter with chocolate. Break the thin crust
of frost on top and begin drinking, taking care not to
get your teeth chilled).
C. —Say, waiter, bring me a typographical error, will
you? ,
W. —Yezzir, yezzir. (Exit waiter. While he is gone,
look around the room, picking out the fire escapes.
As you are on the ground floor, this should not take
long, and is a harmless diversion. (Enter waiter.)
W. —Sorry, sir but there ain't no typographical er
rors, the cook says.
C. —How's that? I see one here on the menu! Say,
what's this here 011 the bill of fare.
W. (inspecting closely)— Don't know, sir, but looks
like gravy. I'll wipe it off.

into a severe epileptic fit. Roll upon the floor, carefully
avoiding table legs, and, between groans, scream out,
"The meat done!! Oh —wow-wow-ow-ow-ow!! The meat
done it!! The meat done it!!" Rather than have any
more scandal, the management will either brain you
with an axe or throw you out the back d00r... In either

a mean look with your mind's eye.)
