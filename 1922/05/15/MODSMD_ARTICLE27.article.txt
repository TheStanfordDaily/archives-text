A Definite Achievement
The announcement that the League of
Nations has prepared a treaty concerning
Upper Silesia, which both Germany and
Poland have agreed to sign, means not
only a triumph for that body, but also
constitutes a definite contribution to the
peace of Europe.
The Allied Supreme Council managed
to prevent a rupture last year only by
referring the Upper Silesian dispute to
the League. For, after the Plebiscite,
the Council was unable to effect a settle
ment acceptable to both nations. The
treaty which the League has prepared
provides for the pooling of the economic
and industrial interests in the region
so that neither Germany nor Poland
can infringe on the rights of the other.
This, Germany feels, compensates her
for the loss of territory sustained as a
result of the Plebiscite.
Two commissions will be established
under the treaty, one to enforce its pro
visions, another to settle private dis
putes.
