# WEDNESDAY TO BE ANNUAL LABOR DAY
## Students Will Be Given Half Holiday to Clear Grounds About Convalescent Home 
### 
Plans for the third annual Labor Day
to be held Wednesday at the Children's
Convalescent Home were completed at a
.meeting of the general committee this
afternoon. Wednesday will be a half
holiday.
Last year, more than a thousand un
dergraduates helped make the Labor Day
a success. The grounds about the Home
were cleaned up, unsightly trees cut down,
and rubbish carried away. This year, the
usual crop of weeds must be cut and the
roads leading into the Home must be
cleaned.
Labor Day developed out of the old
plan whereby eight sophomores went to
the Home to work each Saturday. As
the amount of work on the grounds in
creased and the sophomores were unable
to handle all of it, the students decided in
1920 to set one day aside each year when
the undergraduates would turn out en
masse to work at the Home.
The Children's Convalscent Home was
established in 1919 in the old Acacia
House on the County Road. This loca
tion proved to be unsuitable and in June,
1920, the Home was moved to the old
Stanford Home, where it is now located.
At the present time there are sixteen
children being cared for. The Board of
Directors is planning to turn the main
room of the house into a ward where a
trained nurse will be able to take care
of several more children.
There are twenty-seven acres of land
about the Home and the Convalescent
Home endowment committee is making
an effort to raise enough money to add
more buildings and wards. Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins, chairman of the endow
ment committee, who has been called the
"Fairy Godmother of the Home," has
increased the fund to $68,000 by sub
scriptions from her friends.
