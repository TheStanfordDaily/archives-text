# Professor Clark Talks On Work of Two Artists
## 
### 
Professor A. B. Clark of the Graphic
Art division of the Education depart
ment, gave a lecture on the work of
Hans Holbein and Albrecht Durer, at
the Community House in Palo Alto
Thursday night. His talk was illustrated
by slides and by paintings and drawings
which had been loaned by the San Fran
cisco Palace of Fine Arts and the Hansf
staengel Galleries of New York.
Holbein was spoken of as a German
of Italian grace. He worked rapidly and
has left a collection of eighty sketches
done in pencil, which is unique.
The work of Durer, who was twenty
five years older than Holbein, was con
sidered by Professor Clark as exemplary
of the creations of a mature artist. His
work is medieval in spirit, and his en
gravings on steel and wood afford fine
examples for modern illustrations in pen
and ink.
