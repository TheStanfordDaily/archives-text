## 
### 
D. R. Lane, Night Manager of the
Associated Press in San Francisco,
will be the dinner guest of the Stan
ford Chapter of the American Journal
ists' Association, next Thursday
evening, May 18. The dinner will be
hidd in the New Union. All those
interested in journalism are invited
to attend. Reservations should be
made at once through Kenneth N.
Stewart, '23, president of the asso
ciation; Walter Warren, '22, secre
tary; or the office of Professor Ever
ett W. Smith.
Lane has had a varied and interest
ing experience in journalism. He will
speak informally on various probrems
of newspaper work and on some of his
ideas concerning the future of jour
nalism.
He has been three and a half years
in the San Francisco office of the As
sociated Press, one and a half year as
night manager. For two years he was
assigned by the A. P. to make a spe
cial study of Mexico and Mexican
news. This was the outcome of his
experience in 1911, when, as a free
lance, he was on the Mexican border
gathering material at the time the
revolution broke out.
Lane began his newspaper work in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, immediate
ly after he left college, and was on
other papers in that state. Then for
a time he was in moving pictures, pri
marily for the purpose of gathering
definite knowledge for use in writing
but incidentally becoming an actor.
Following this experience came his
Mexican border activities after which
he was engaged in general publicity
work, fiction writing, and magazine
editing. He was at Santa Fe when,
in response to a long distance tele
phone call he joined the Denver staff
of the Associated Press, going on duty
there within two days after receiving
the call, and within two weeks filling
every job in the office with the ex
ception of that of manager.
