# CLEAN-UP OF ENDOWMENT CAMPAIGN BEGUN TODAY BY EIGHTY-FIVE WORKERS
## 
### 
Clean-up work in the student endowment drive, which started with a
tive-day effort in February began at 4 o'clock today, at a meeting of over
85 workers in the endowment offices, at which cards with names of 864 stu
dents not yet interviewed were distributed and checked. The eight com
mittees will start work this evening, approximately ten cards being assigned
to each convasser.
Reports for the first day's canvassing will be received in the Union
tomorrow at 7 o'clock. A special committee room has been assigned, and
the meeting will combine supper and report, so as to save the workers' time.

These report meetings will continue
until the clean-up is finished, no spe
cial time being set to end up the can
vass, as in the five-day campaign.
The distribution of new students,
and those not seen last quarter as as
follows: campus (those not in living
groups), 109; commuters, 107; Encina,
97; fraternities 163; Palo Alto, 871;
