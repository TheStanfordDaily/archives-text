# 1923 OPERA DISTINGUISHED BY SKILLFUL CHORUS WORK
## Intricate Steps Reflect Direction Of Coach Lester Seib; Plot Much Like Past 
### Kenneth N. Stewart, '23 
""Up On a Ladder" got over —and it got over big, in spite of qualms,
secret and expressed, on the part of some of those on the inside.
The success of the 1923 Junior Opera, Saturday night, was due to one
person. That person was Coach Lester Seib. Some may disargee, and
some who worked hard and did well may be offended. That is their privilege.
One rather ragged exit was absolutely the only flaw in the quantity of
intricate chorus work, which had been skillfully worked out and directed
by Seib. If applause can be taken as an indication of quality, the Ballet
Russe, which opened the second act, was the best thing of its kind that the
campus has produced. After the spectacular finish of the vigorous dance by

Helen Whitney and Foresta Hodgson,
it was close to five minutes before the
play could go on. The audience went
wild over the number, which was a
combination of a picturesque opening
with Stoddard Atwood and the two
(lancers as its center, a stirring dance
by the choruses in colorful costumes,
appropriate music by Lloyd Howard
and Charles Midgley, and extremely
geautiful and skillful dancing by the
two imps.
The women's choruses showed that
ballet costumes were not necessary
to the successful presentation of an
opera, and their afternoon and even
ing dresses were effective. A consci
entious effort was made to take from
the show every element of revue of
pageantcy, and the Ballet Russe was
the only number that did not carry out
this idea. "Up On a Ladder" was
distinctive in that it presented a con
nected'and unified whole from start to
finish.
It is the music which makes an opera
and the campus yesterday was whist
ling the catchy theme songs of the
show, "Up On a Ladder" (Richard
Malaby, and "Trouble" (Midgley).
Clever effects were secured in "Heigh
Ho Hum," the number with a fast
counter melody over a slower, and in
"Radio Love." D. W. Evans, perpe
tual lyric writer for the campus, did
some of his best work this year.
Handling of the orchestra and musical
program showed study and care on the
part of Midgley, the director.
Rosemary Drachman and Tom Kleck
ner wrote the book for the 1923 show.
It might have been the opera of 1901
or 1953, for all that it differed from
other third year productions. But
they provided a thread to which the
music might be attached and they
provided consistent types for the
cast —which is all one asks of the
authors of an opera.
Seldom does a cast seem so con
fidently at ease and so accustomed to
public performance as did those on
the stage Saturday night and scarcely
a hitch or word of prompting could
be detected, even from the third row.
It was indeed an evening that brings
sorrow to a critic's heart, for there
were* only three persons whose work
was not satisfactory at all times, and
each of whom had counter-acting
qualities.
Helen Whitney's name was last on
the program but she did more to keep
things moving when they threatened to
drag, than anyone else on the stage.
She and Foresta Hodgson made friends
with the audience with their first en
trance.
Geraldine Watt had an insipid role
as Marjorie and her mechanical act
ing was probably emphasized in con
trast to the enthusiasm, ease and
childish coyness with which Edythe
Baylis followed her "Bill" through the
two acts. Miss Baylis is undoubtedly
an actress and Miss Watt has a pleas
ing lyric voice. The men's leads were
annoyingly juvenille, but blame the
authors. Dick Pershing showed more
confidence and with a better voice,
more experience and easier move
ment, outshone Dick Richmond, who,
however, has gained greater control
for himself since the "Charm School."
Ivo Copeland as Stephanie was given
the hardest lines in the fllay and only
Ivo Copeland could have put them
over. The unpleasantness incident to
making herself hideous for the amuse
ment of the public must have been
fully compensated by the storm of ap
plause with which Miss Copeland's
scarecrow dance was greeted.
The only really clever lines in "Up
On a Ladder" were handled in trut
Claflinistic manner, and Paul Claflir
chalked up another one in his dra
matic career. Fred Hughes as the
helpful Dawson was better than he
ever has been and made much out of
a character that could have been un
interesting. Whatever was said about
Arnold Bayley last year (and it was
nothing but complimentary) could be
repeated this year because the only
difference between the Simon of
"Maid to Order" and the Mr. Boukow
ski of "Up On a Ladder " was the
name.
Ivan and Sandy were thrown in for
a good measure. Stoddard Atwood
consistently carried through a part
that did not have much place in an
opera, and said nothing, so well that
he made a deep impression. Warren
Lewis was a good Scotch dialect but
"Up On a Ladder" could have dona
just as well without him.
