"Al Is Wiser Than The Others
Because He Brings Me Candy"
"It shows that he will
always be thoughtful
about the pleasures that
make life worth while r
for a firl."

_ j
THE CAPITOL BUILDING
BUENOS AIRES. ARGENTINA
Most of the famous buildings of the world
are equipped with Otis Elevators.
IF architecture be "frozen music" this is
indeed a symphony in stone! Certainly it
is one of the most beautiful buildings in South
America. And quite naturally it is equipped
with Otis Elevators.
The aim of the Otis organization is a world
service in vertical transportation. No country
is "foreign" in this respect. If there be any
demand from any race in any country to build
upward—one of the sure signs of advancing
civilization—the Otis institution is ready to fill
that demand.
It is a unique position for one firm to hold in
any industry; to have been the first in the field,
to have made practically all the improvements
in the conception and mechanism of vertical
transportation and to maintain a leadership that
has never been seriously challenged even in this
day of industrial competition.
