# "ADAM AND EVA" AS SENIOR PLAY WILL END STAGE SEASON
## Play Adopted from American Home Life; Had Successful Run in New York Theatre 
### 
"Adam and Eva," a comedy, by Guy
Bolton and George Middleton, has been
chosen as the 1922 Senior Farce, and
will be presented Wednesday night,
June 14.
"Adam and Eva," which had an un
usual successful run in New York, is
a new comedy of American home life
full of amusing incidents and unex
pected happiness. The cast is large
for this type of play, having twelve
good parts which demand all types of
persons. Many of the parts are cap
able of distinct characterization.
The New York Telegram says of
the play, "Adam and Eva" is far and
away the healthiest, happiest, cleanest
and most sincere forward step that the
playwrights of the season have made
in the direction of genuine light com
edy." The New York Sun's comments
are that "Adam and Eva" is highly
amusing—genuine comedy of Amer
ican life —entire cast is clever. The
story of a rich father and spoiled rela
tives delights audiences. A success
that is certain to endure as long as
the rest of them."
Dramatic Coach Gordon Davis is
well pleased with the-selection ani
anticipates a large turnout of try
outeels. Preliminary tryouts were
held this afternoon and will be held
again tonight in the Assembly Hall,
between 7 and 8. All persons except
freshman women and those who have
participated in more than two plays
this year are eligible to tryout.
