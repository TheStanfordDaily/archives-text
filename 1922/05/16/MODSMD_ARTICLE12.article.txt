# OPERA MARKS NEW ERA IN TECHNICAL WORK OF STAGE
## 
### Kenneth N. Stewart, '23 
For the first time a play has been pro
duced on the Stanford campus absolutely
free from the stigma of commercialism.
The technical work of "Up On a Ladder"
was done entirely by Gordon Davis'
Theater Workshop (English 21). The
only persons paid for their services were
those holding responsible executive po
sitions for the Dramatic Council: the
stage manager, the electrician and
the property man. The rest was ac
complished through the combination of
class laboratory work, student activity,
and an interest in stage art for its own
sake.
The 1923 Junior Opera was the most
complete student dramatic enterprise in
Stanford's history. The book, lyrics and
music were written by students. The sets
were designed and built entirely by stu
dents. The play was coached by a stu
dents, who were recompensed not b>
cash but by class credit or genuine pleas
ure in their work. The play was coached
by a student. And the interesting and
encouraging part of it all is that the sav
ing in money does not go into individual
pockcts but toward further improvement
of the Assembly Hall stage and a
greater profit for the class giving the
play.
Under the direction of Chrysella Dun
kcr, art director, members of the English
21 class dyed and stenciled the rich hang
ings for the back of the stage in the sec
ond act of "Up On a Ladder" ; they made
the attractive lanterns which hung from
the ceiling. Actual building of the
scenery was done under the direction of

Clyde Coakley. Edward Farmer de
signed the sets, which rivaled in impres
sive beauty those of the metropolitan
stage. Carroll Hudson handled the lights
and Cecil Morris was in charge of prop
erties. All of these are enrolled in the
Theater Workshop class and all of their
assistance came from others taking the
course or from interested volunteer stu
dents.
Campus shows hereafter will provide
the most practical kind of laboratory for
experimentation in stage production. It
is Davis' plan to give the course every
quarter, thus constantly providing a force
to care for the technical side of every
play presented.
In addition to saving money for the
play-producing organizations, allowing
cheaper seat prices and stage improve
ments, the class is giving an opportunity
for preparation in the work of produc
tion which many students intend to take
up after graduation, in high schools, col
legs and communities.
Had the 1923 opera failed from the
spectator's point of view, it would have
been significant in that it marked the
opening of a period of a true spirit for
co-operation through a desire to learn
and to accomplish things on the stage
without hope for monetary recompense.
The complete success of the opera as a
whole and the perfection with which the
technical staff did its wor, emphasides
the importance of this new era and is
the most encouraging development in
Stanford dramatics since that activity
began its steady improvement.
