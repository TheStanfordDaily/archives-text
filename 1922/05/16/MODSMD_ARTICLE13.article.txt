### 
Stanford's third annual Labor Day will be held tomorrow afternoon at the
Children's Convalescent Home. All classes in the university will be post
poned in order that the undergraduates may help beautify the grounds about
the Home.
Arrangements have been made by Perry Shaw, in charge of transportation,
to have all women in the university taken to the grounds where a special
place has been set aside for them to work... Otto Nyquist, University gardener,
and Major Collins of the Military Department have provided trucks for trans
portation. The trucks will call at Roble and at the various sorority houses
at 1:30 o'clock.
Work at the Home will begin promptly at 1:30. Trucks and wagons witl
call at the fraternities and homes of professors tomorrow morning to get all
available tools. There will be enough tools on hand tomorrow afternoon for
the fifteen hundred students who are expected to turn out.
"Chet" Douglas, chairman of the Labor Committee has plans worked

out whereby workers will be divided
into several groups. The women will
be in charge of the work in the garden
near the house. Grass and weeds
which have grown up about the trees
were cut down last week and one
group of men will load them on the
wagons and dump them into San Fran
cisquito Creek. Another group will
have charge of cutting down dead
trees. A third group will clear the
weeds and rubbish from the edges of
the roads around the Home and from
the highway entrance to the grounds.
These laborers will be in charge of
"Chet" Douglas, Dick Faville, "Kewp"
Sproull, "Jimmy" Ross Carey Bail
ard, Margaret White.
Food will be served as soon as the
work has been completed. The bill
of fare will consist of barbecued meat,
sandwiches, coffee, and ice cream.
No meals will be served at the living
groups on the campus tomorrow night,
but the sororities will furnish five
dozen sandwiches each, and the fra
ternities and eating clubs three dollars
each to help to pay for the food. The
barbecue pit will be the same one
used last year, but food will be placed
at four distributing centers.
An impromptu program will be pre
sented following the barbecue. "Tex"
Talbert will deliver a negro sermon.
Alabaster and Mertz will play a saxa
phone duet, and Arnold Bayley will da
some imitations. The Glee Club
Quartet will present several numbers,
and Les Seib will do a specialty song
and dance act.
Men will march to the Convalescent
Home in two bodies. One line, which
will start from the Delta Tau Delta'
i house, will be in charge of "Chet"
Douglas and will include men from the
Row. A second line will leave Encina
i under "Lou" Minsky and "Bob" Con
nolly. Both lines will form at 1 :15.
