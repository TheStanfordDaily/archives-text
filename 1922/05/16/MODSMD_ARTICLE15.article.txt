# ALUMNI ENDOWMENT EFFORT IS PARALLEL TO CAMPUS "CLEAN-UP"
## 
### 
Outside endowment canvassing,
paralleling that on the campus which
entered its final stage yesterday, has
raised the total for the first million
to $850,000. The campaign has now
started north of the bay region, and
will work up to Sacramento valley, as
far as Eureka. In the south, alumni
organizations are cleaning up the large
cities and working north towards the
Santa Clara valley.
The first million will be raised on
the Pacific Coast, according to pres
ent indications. By the end of the
week the endowment organization will
enter the northwest, going as far as
Vancouver, B.C. Next week the cam
paign will be moved east, starting at
Salt Lake City and Denver.
June 15 is the time now set by
endowment officials for the first mil
lion dollars to be completely furnish
ed. Many of the larger cities are still
working 011 their 4ists. San Francisco
has so far subscribed $148,000, Los
Angeles reports $80 000, and Oakland
has turned in $26,000, Berkeley and
Alameda alumni are still campaign
ing.
The bulk of the second million is
expected to come from the outside
public. All alumni will be given a
chance to subscribe, however, although
their biggest task ceases with the rais
ing of the initial minion.
The first meeting of the clean up
committee on the campus will be held
at dinner in the Union this evening
at 7 o'clock. At this time reports on
the first day's canvassing will be
given out, and an estimate formed of
the proportion of the 864 listed stu
dents who are subscribing, and of how
much may be expected from this cam
paign.
