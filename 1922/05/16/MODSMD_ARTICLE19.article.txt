# "AS YE LABOR"
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon is our chance to get out and
do our part in providing; a clean and happy home for
the Stanford Convalescents. As the Chairman of
the Labor Day Committee put it last night, "If you
fellows see the happy time that those kids lead out
there away from the crowded conditions of the city,
you couldn't keep from giving some of your time to
making the place a little better for them."
The Convalescent Home has been in operation for
several years now and is kept up by the University
and outside subscription. Some of the campus or
ganizations contribute to its welfare with drives and
money from shows.
The main chance to the whole student body to
help the children out there comes but once a year
on our annual Labor Day. Then we go out and put
in three or four hours' work and call it a day. It
doesn't seem like much, but when you count up
three hours' work multiplied by five hundred or a
thousand, quite a bit can be accomplished.
Three years ago there were big trees to be felled
and rank growth of years to be grubbed oft" the
ground. This has been taken care of, so that now
there are only some weedy places to be scraped and
some raking to be done. This will be practically no
effort, as far as real labor is concerned, if everyone
comes out to. the Farm in the afternoon. For that
purpose there will be no classes after 12 o'clock.
It remains with the organizations. If the leaders
take care of their organizations and see that all of
the members come out to spend the afternoon the
work will be accomplished and the kids at the 1 lome
will have their place fixed up for another season.
'T^his will also be the first thing done in preparation
for Alumni Day. So if you can possibly make it to
the Farm, come out and do your part and then enjoy
the "Big Eats" and entertainment afterwards.
