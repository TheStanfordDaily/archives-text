# A 						NEW RUSHING SYSTEM
## 
### 
1 The plan providing for late spring bidding and
an entirely simplified method of entertainment for
women's fraternities, recently drawn up by a com
mittee of house presidents in conjunction with Dean
•Yost, will be presented to the women as a whole at
a mass meeting tonight.
The long-considered and ever-troublesome prob
lem of a rushing system is given a hinge for a
satisfactory solution in the proposed plan. It rep
resents a co-operative effort of the fraternity women
and the University to promote the interests of both
and of the new students. In form, it is a contract
between the University and the fraternities, and its
success depends upon the carrying out of the spirit,
as well as the words expressed in it.
Any economic hardship which might arise in the
houses from the loss of a freshman class is removed
by the three concessions in which the University
offers to remove the requirement of three quarters'
residence in Roble for students entering in the
winter and spring quarters who may join fraterni
ties, to let transfers who affiliate leave Roble after
one quarter, and to change the present requirement
of two years of residence with parents for women
not living in Roble, to one year. These concessions,
especially the last, will be a financial aid to the
fraternities, as well as a decided advantage in re
gard to bringing the units closer together by virtue
of including the women in the fraternity group
shortly after they become members.
One of the most outstanding points of the pro

posed contract is the doing away with "rushing - ," in
the sense that it is now understood as a formal
period of entertainment. In its place will be sub
stituted the gradual growth of friendship through
casual rather than concentrated contact. Such a
system should put rushing on a saner basis, one
which will work for the good of the individual as
well as of the group, and which should develop a
better and broader type of fraternity and University
spirit.
The complete details and regulations for the new
plan will require careful consideration and handling
before the final acceptance. A thorough under
standing of the points involved and the co-operation
of all of the women will attend to these—success is
embodied in the basic principles. B. Y.
