# WORTH WATCHING

Next Saturday night in the Basketball Pavilion
Charlie Field will stage a show in connection with
the annual alumni banquet, which will end at 10
o'clock. After the show the floor will be cleared, good
music has been secured, and a dance will be con
ducted to help defray the costs of Alumni Day.
Any students who were fortunate enough to crawl
into the banquet at Roble Hall last spring will not
miss a chance to see Charlie Field conduct another
of his famous affairs. The dance committee has an
nounced that any who do not attend the banquet itself,
who wish to dance, may come early, take seats in the
balcony, and enjoy the program and show before
dancing begins.
The show and dance together should be one of the
best for enjoyment purposes perpetrated on the cam
pus this spring, and a great many students will at
tend for this reason, as well as for the fact that we
should support as well as possible this function de
signed to defray tjie expenses of Alumni Day, the
most important of occasions which the students fos
ter each year. The balconies as well as the main
floor will be crowded by those who wish to see Charlie
Field and his gang do their stuff again, and there are
a great many clever undergraduates of the present
day who can well afford to look on and take notes
while these old boys perform. Dancing will begin
at 10 o'clock.
