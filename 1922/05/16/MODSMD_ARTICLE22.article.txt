HEROES.
"Heroes" are foolish things.
I laugh at them.
They are invariable good looking. They always have a
square jaw and white teeth and curly hair.
They are always abused.
At some part of the play they ride swiftly—no matter
whether it be on horse-back, in taxis, in airplanes,
autos or in sea-going hacks, they ride swiftly to
save the heroine.
They almost always have a scene in which they have
their sleeves rolled up over their muscular fore
arms. It is in these scenes that they wall their
eyes and look holy.
They are infallible. In the first act they are down
trodden. In the second they are misunderstood. In
the third they are involved. In the fourth they are
imperiled. In the fifth they are immense.
Sometimes they try to conceal the fact that they are
Heroes, but they always give themselves away in
the last act. The Hero is the one who clinches
with the heroine, no matter what his race, color
or previous conditions of servitude.
BESIDES my girl falls for them.
Heroes are foolish things.

No wonder it was called "Up On a Ladder." As a

over; so handing them over, said, "Go out there and

It was very gratifying to see the chorus condescend
to do all the steps... By the way they strolled from
one place to another it seems that they didn't recognize
some of the best chorus numbers ever put on this stage.

HEROES.
"Heroes" are foolish things.
I laugh at them.
They are invariable good looking. They always have a
square jaw and white teeth and curly hair.
They are always abused.
At some part of the play they ride swiftly—no matter
whether it be on horse-back, in taxis, in airplanes,
autos or in sea-going hacks, they ride swiftly to
save the heroine.
They almost always have a scene in which they have
their sleeves rolled up over their muscular fore
arms. It is in these scenes that they wall their
eyes and look holy.
They are infallible. In the first act they are down
trodden. In the second they are misunderstood. In
the third they are involved. In the fourth they are
imperiled. In the fifth they are immense.
Sometimes they try to conceal the fact that they are
Heroes, but they always give themselves away in
the last act. The Hero is the one who clinches
with the heroine, no matter what his race, color
or previous conditions of servitude.
