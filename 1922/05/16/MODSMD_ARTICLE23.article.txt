United States Refuses to Join-
Hague Conference
Secretary Hughes refused to accept
the invitation issued from Genoa inviting
the United States to attend a conference
soon to be held at The Hague, on the
grounds that it will merely be the Genoa
Conference under another name and will
be liable to the same difficulties which
that meeting has experienced so long as
the attitude of Russia remains un
changed. l?y changing the location of
the Conference and making the impres
sion that it will be something different,
the European powers hoped to entice the
United States to take part.
The Genoa parley has been a failur;
and the only possibility of making the
new one a success seems to be the pres
ence of the United States and its un
limited resources.
At a dinner given by the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States at Wash
ington, Secretary Hoover said that
though the United States wishes to help
Russia, that country must recognize the
right to hold private property, the sanc
tity of contract, and the right of free
labor. This they have not done and our
help cannot be forthcoming.
Borah Proposes
Russian Recognition
Senator Borah introduced a resolution
into the Senate yesterday stating that the
Senate favors the recognition of the de
facto government of Russia. This, he
says, would lead to the final settlement
of all the problems which are worrying
the Allied governments. Russia's finan
cial problems cannot be adjusted, lie as
serts, while it is outside the pale of the
nations. With the recognition of Russia
commerce would commence which would
set Russia on its feet and be a benefit to
the rest of the world as well.
The Allies, lie declares, are seeking to
destroy Germany and to force Russia
back under the old regime. This, he be
lieves, would be both impossible and un
desirable.
