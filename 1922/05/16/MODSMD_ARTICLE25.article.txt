# GARDNER WOOD WILL OPPOSE STATE WATER AND POWER CONTROL
## 
### 
Gardner P. Wood, president of the
Young Men's Republican League of
California, will speak in opposition to
the proposed Water and Power Act, next
Thursday evening, in room 12 of the
Law building. Wood will answer the
arguments set forth by Mayor Bartlett
of Berkeley in his speech here, May 4,
advocating the act.
The Water and Power Act was pro
posed by initiative petition and is to be
voted on at the next general election. It
provides for the issuance of $50,000,000
worth of bonds for the purpose of public
control and development of state water
and power resources. Supporters of the
act claim that it is both necessary and ad
vantageous and point to the success of
similar laws in other parts of the coun
try. Opponents, on the other hand, say
the proposed measure would not accom
plish the purpose for which it was in
tended, and that it would result in an un
necessary expense on the public. They
further point out that the water and
power board created by the act would be
vested with too much authority.
The meeting Thursday is under the
auspices of Euphronia Debating Society,
and is open to the public.
