## 
### 
One lone game, instead of five sched
uled, made up the intramural baseball
program yesterday afternoon, the others
being postponed pr forfeited. Alpha Chi
Sigma forfeited to Beta Theta Pi, Alpha
Sigma Phi presented a game to Phi
Kappa Psi, and Theta Chi failed to show
up for its engagement with El Capitan.
Alpha Kappa Lambda took a 9 to 2
win from El Campo in the one contest
which was played. Young, the El Campo
pitcher, was hit hard, and his teammates
seemed unable to get to Howe in the
pinches. In the first inning, with two
men down, Howe drew first blood with
a long home run to left field. Cornell
then doubled, but was stranded on sec
ond when the next man went out. In
the fourth, Sloan of Alpha Kappa Lamb
do contributed another four-base blow
which put his team far out of danger.
Howe and Van Bebber made up the Al
pha Kappa Lambda battery, with Young
and Sanford for El Campo.
Several informal practice games were
played, with Sigma Chi taking on Kappa
Sigma, and Enciua tangling with El
Capitan.
There will be no more intramural
games until Thursday. Teams are urged
to get out and play their scheduled games
instead of forfeiting, as gymnasium
credit is given to individual players, and
a forfeit is hardly fair to the opposing
team.
