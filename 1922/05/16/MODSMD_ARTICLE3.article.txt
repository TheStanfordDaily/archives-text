# FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA TRACK MEN ENTRAIN FOR EASTERN MEETS
## 
### 
Coach Walter Christie and fifteen
Blue and Gold track men entrained
last Sunday night for the East and the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Cambridge.
Christie pronounced every man on the
squad in good shape before the party
left.
Coach Christie will depend on the
strength of numbers because of the ab
sence of real individual stars on the
Bruin team this year. The team will
first go to Ithaca, N. Y., where they
will meet the Cornell team, conceded
to be one of the six best in the East.
Five of the six men who won the
meet for California at Cambridge last
year, are making the trip again this
year. These are "Brick" Muller, "Oxy"
Hendrixson, "Bob" Hutchison, "Al,"
Norris and "Charley" Dorr. "Pesky"
Sprott is the only missing member.
Berkey, Boren, Van Sant, Treyer
Peterson, and Sorrenti, will make their
debut in national competition, but
Christie hopes that all of these men
will come in for at least one point.
