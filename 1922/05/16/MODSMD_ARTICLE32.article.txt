# TWO ONE ACT PLAYS ARE SELECTED FOR FINAL ELIMINATION
## 
### 
Two plays, "Flesh and Blood," by
Sherl Levy, '24, and "One in a Hun
dred," by D. R. Martin, '23, have been
selected for public presentation in the
Assembly Hall May 31, to determine the
winner of the Dramatic Council's one
act play contest. These plays, which
were selected from the fourteen sub
mitted, were judged at Stanford by Dra
matic Coach Gordon Davis and Profes
sors Lee Emerson Bassett and Henry D.
Gray, and at Berkeley by Sam Hume,
director of the Greek Theater, and Irv
ing Pichel, his assistant.
Gordon Davis expressed himself as be
ing highly pleased with this initial effort
to stimulate students to develop their
play-writing ability by a public contest.
It was the plan to select three or possibly
four plays for presentation, but two dif
ficulties arose: first, that the judges
could not come to a decision on a third
play, and, second, that the time between
the Junior Opera and the Senior Farce
would not permit the production of more
than two plays.
The other manuscripts were, on the
whole, excellent, according to Gordon
Davis, but in some points or other failed
to measure up to the standards set by
the first two. The following plays and
authors deserve honorary mention:
"David," by Russell Stroup; "Interlude,"
by Lois Eldredge; "Daybreak," by John
W. Cohen, and"A Bubble in the Steel,"
by Mollie Windish.
Contrary to the original plan, Gordon
Davis' class in Theatrical Workshop will
undertake the entire production of the
two plays selected.
After the production of the plays on
Wednesday, May 31, the winner of the
$50 prize will be announced.
