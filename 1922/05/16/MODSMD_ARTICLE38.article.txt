# BOY OPERATORS USED TO JOLLY THEIR PATRONS
## 
### 
One experiment in the early days of
the tlephone proved a dismal failure
—that of employing boys as central
office operators. Even with careful
supervision, it was found, the young
sters lacked the necessary application
and ability to settle down to the seri
ous business that their job required,
and the plan of using girl operators
was soon adopted and has been follow
ed generally ever since.
A writer in the Kansas City "Star"
records the reminiscences of one of
these boys, now grown pray-haired, of
the days of the early 80's when he and
another lad held the telephone destini
es, of the Kansas City subscribers in
the hollow of their hands —or more
properly speaking, between the chubby
and doubtless, begrimed fingers which
plugged in the connections on the
crude switchboard over which they
presided.
"Among the first to install one of
the new wonder toys," the former
operator declares, "was the Theater
Comique, the variety house down at
Fourth and Walnut streets. They ad
vertised that they would place it on
the stage every night with a mega
phone attachment, and so we had to
cut in pretty nearly all our customers
on that line every night and they would
all get talking to one another, and
believe me, we had a merry time with
litat bunch. The Comique crowd was
a source of endless amusement for
the bright boys at central. It was the
of town to call up and ask connections
custom for parties in different parts
with anybody, just to see how the thing
worked. There was a pretty lively
crowd of chorus girls down there at
the Comique in (hose days—full of
pep and other things.
"One night a West Side preacher
who wanted to exhibit his new machine
to some of his parishioners called up
and asked us to connect him with
somebody for a few minutes' conversa
tion. It was just like that other boy
to suggest the Theater Comique, and
we switched the parson on* One of
the girls answered the phone and to
get things going just right we told her
it was Frank Alms, the saloon keeper,
who wanted to talk. Well, she was
in pretty good form, anyway, and the
preacher and his little party got a
liberal education in North End slang
in about fifteen lively minutes. He
called up afterwards and asked 'who
the lady was with whom he had just
been conversing," but we told him that
we kept no records of the connections
—which was a fact."

supervision, it was found, the young
sters lacked the necessary application
and ability to settle down to the seri
ous business that their job required,
and the plan of using girl operators
was soon adopted and has been follow
ed generally ever since.
A writer in the Kansas City "Star"
records the reminiscences of one of
these boys, now grown pray-haired, of
the days of the early 80's when he and
another lad held the telephone destini
es, of the Kansas City subscribers in
the hollow of their hands —or more
properly speaking, between the chubby
and doubtless, begrimed fingers which
plugged in the connections on the
crude switchboard over which they
presided.
"Among the first to install one of
the new wonder toys," the former
operator declares, "was the Theater
Comique, the variety house down at
Fourth and Walnut streets. They ad
vertised that they would place it on
the stage every night with a mega
phone attachment, and so we had to
cut in pretty nearly all our customers
on that line every night and they would
all get talking to one another, and
believe me, we had a merry time with
litat bunch. The Comique crowd was
a source of endless amusement for
the bright boys at central. It was the
of town to call up and ask connections
custom for parties in different parts
with anybody, just to see how the thing
worked. There was a pretty lively
crowd of chorus girls down there at
the Comique in (hose days—full of
pep and other things.
"One night a West Side preacher
who wanted to exhibit his new machine
to some of his parishioners called up
and asked us to connect him with
somebody for a few minutes' conversa
tion. It was just like that other boy
to suggest the Theater Comique, and
we switched the parson on* One of
the girls answered the phone and to
get things going just right we told her
it was Frank Alms, the saloon keeper,
who wanted to talk. Well, she was
in pretty good form, anyway, and the
preacher and his little party got a
liberal education in North End slang
in about fifteen lively minutes. He
called up afterwards and asked 'who
the lady was with whom he had just
been conversing," but we told him that
we kept no records of the connections
—which was a fact."
