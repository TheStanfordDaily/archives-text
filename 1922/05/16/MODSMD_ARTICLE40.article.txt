Among the new books at the Library
this week is George H. Boker's "Plays
and Poems." There are four tragedies
in this volume, the first being "Calay
nos," a Spanish play centered around
the city of Seville. "Anne Boleyn,"
has for its plot the story of the second
wife of Henry VIII. The two other
tragedies are "Leonor de Guzman,"
and Francesca Da Rimini." This edi
tion also contains a large collection
of the author's best odes, ballads, son
nets, and lyrics. Some of Boker's po
ems concerning incidents of the Civil
War are "Hooker's Across!" "Before
Vicksburg " and "The Battle of Look
out Mountain."
"The Veil," written by Walter De La
Mare, is another book that contains a
varied selection of poems. Of this
author the London Times says "Two
things of which age certainly robs
those who were once children are,
first, their beauty, and then, their
dreams. Mr. De Lo Mare's poefs have
lost neither. Some of the poems in
this book are 'The Imp Within,' 'Be
fore Dawn,' and 'The Unfinished
Dream.'"
