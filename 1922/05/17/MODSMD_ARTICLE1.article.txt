# ANNUAL BASEBALL FIGHT IS ABOLISHED BY EX â€“ COMMITTEE
## Decisive Action Taken Upon Recommendation of Dr. Wilbur, Skull and Snakes 
### 
The annual spring baseball fight was
abolished by the Executive Committee at
its regular session last evening, a sug
gestion being offeted that some other
form of interclass contest be substituted.
Skull and Snakes Society, to which the
matter was referred last week, recom
mended its abolition.
The controversy over the abolition of
the fight was brought to a head when a
letter from President Wilbur was re
ceived by Dan Evans, president of the
Associated Students. Dr. Wilbur char
acterized the fight as "one of the most
demoralizing influences upon the whole
student group." Dean Culver was also
strongly in favor of abolition.
Medals were awarded to all three
members of the Joffre debating team.
The debate was won by a Stanford man
and the question arose last week as to
whether the other two men should re
ceive the award which would naturally
go to the winner. An investigation in
dicated that the Stanford team was su
perior to its rivals, as the rankings given
the men in the debate by the judges
gave Stanford the first two places and a
tic for third.
On the recommendation of Skull and
Snakes, it was voted to grant additional
awards to all athletes, to be in the form
of certificates of two distinct types for
major and minor sports. This will be
effective October, 1922.
Nominations for officers during the
school year of 1922-23 have been set for
Wednesday, May 31, so that the yearly
student body election can be held on
Wednesday of the following week.
June 7.
A dance for the benefit of the T. C.
A. A. A. A. track team will be given
by the Associated Students in the pa
vilion on Saturday night, May 27.
