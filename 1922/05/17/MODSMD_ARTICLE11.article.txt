# FRATERNITY WOMEN HEAR SUGGESTIONS FOR SPRING BIDDING
## 
### 
Changes in the present women's rush
ing system were suggested by Dean Yost
at a mass meeting of fraternity women
held last night in the Women's Club
house. A year's informal rushing will
be substituted for formal rushing every
quarter if the proposed contract which
has been drawn up by a committee ap
pointed from the house presidents and
Miss'Yost is accepted by Panhellenic.
The idea of the proposed contract is to
give the fraternity women and the new
women a chance to meet each other and
to become acquainted under normal con
ditions, and to do away with the con
fusion of rushing at the beginning of
each quarter.
The new contract will work for the
good of the University and the fraterni
ties, according to the opinion of Dean
Yost and the committee which formu
lated the plan. Discussions of the pro
posed system will be held in the various
houses and any changes or modifications
of the plan may be sent to Panhellenic
before the measure is presented to each
group for final action.
