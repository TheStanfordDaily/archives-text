# TEN-MAN TRACK TEAM STARTS EAST FRIDAY
## Cardinal Squad Will Not Enter Mid-Western Meets On Return 
### 
After a week filled with random
rumors, the personnel of the Cardi
nal track squad remains unchanged,
and the men originally selected by
Templeton are ready to board the
train Friday for Cambridge and the
I. C. A. A. A."A. meet on May 26
and 27.
With definite word from Eddie Sud
den, that he would make the trip, the
last obstacle in the way of a strong
Cardinal representation at the cham
pionships was removed. Sudden left
Monday for Pasadena, where he has
been training under the tutelage of
Charley Paddock 011 the latter's pri
vate track. The Cardinal speed
burner is expected to arrive 011 the
campus either Thursday or Friday
morning.
There may, however, be a last-min
ute change in the Cardinal team. All
effort is being made to enter Judah,
and if the eastern officials permit this
change the quarter miler will be
among "those present when the squad
leaves Friday on the Overland limited.
Judah has been following close behind
Williamson in every race this year,
who ran the 440 in 4!) second Saturday.
The faculty committee on athletics,
at a meeting yesterday morning, is
sued a decree forbidding participation

ill any but the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet,
which means that any plans to enter
the N. C. A. A. affair at Chicago and
the Western Conference meet at lowa
City will have to be abandoned.
While every member of Templeton's
original team will make the trip, sev
eral of them are far from being in
the best of shape. Morris Kirksey,
abruptly halted in his efforts to get
Into championship form by a pulled
tendon, can enter the 220 yard dash
only, leaving the burden in the cen
tury on Sudden. The several pre
liminary heats will be a severe strain
011 Kirksey's leg, and in addition, he
has Woodring of Syracuse to compete
against.
"Tiny" Hartranft is the other real
"cripple" of the Cardinal delegation.
The injury to his leg is handicapping
him especially in the discus, where a
quick "reverse" motion is necessary.
If his leg recovers as fast as the doc
tors expect, the weight man will be
fit. when he arrives in Boston.
In the meantime, Hartranft is doing
as well as could be expected in the
shot put. He sent the iron ball out
47 feet Monday, despite the fact that
he used 110 leg action. "Reg" Caughey,
former Stanford weight star, was out
giving Hartranft a few pointers yes
terday afternoon. Â»
