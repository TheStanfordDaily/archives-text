# EFFICIENCY OF UNITED STATES COMMENDED
## "Compares Favorably With Any Foreign Nation," Says Dr. Alsberg in His Speech 
### 
Were one to compare the United
States government with the government
of any foreign in point of view
of economy, efficiency or conservation
of labor, it is not probable that our coun
try would suffer from the comparison.
Such was the conviction which Dr. Carl
Alsberg, director of the Stanford Food
Research Institute, voiced in his lecture
last evening in the Little Theater. The
subject upon which he spoke was "Re
organization in the Federal Service."
The prime function of any govern
ment, Dr. Alsberg contended, is to ren
der efficient service, and it is only by
cutting down the efficiency of that serv
ice that the cost of operation can be ma
terially reduced. In this, he said, the ad
ministration of a nation differs most rad
ically from the administration of a pri
vate corporation. This statement was
made in reply to the general newspaper
criticism which has so long accused the
federal government of wastefulness in
its operations.
Another point of criticism which the
public has directed against the govern
ment is its seeming duplication of work.
One example often cited is the innumer
able groups of chemists which form a
part of at least eighteen bureaus of the
federal service. It has been suggested
that a reorganization of the government
be effected so that all of these chemists
could be brought under a single depart
ment of chemistry, to handle all chemical
investigation and research for the gov
ernment at a central office. This ar
rangement, Dr. Alsberg explained, would
be absolutely impossible if we are to re
tain even a small measure of the ef
ficiency now evident under the current
organization. It would be quite as sen
sible, said the speaker, for the govern
ment to have bureaus of stenographers
or typists to carry on the federal
work at a central office, instead of per
mitting the various departments of the
government to have their own employees
to perform these functions.
The organization of the federal serv
ice which Dr. Alsberg advocates would
be an organization based upon the aims
of the departments. In the Treasury
Department, for example, the one func
tion would be the collection and appor
tionment of funds, leaving such func
tions as public health supervision which
is now under the Treasury Department,
to other bureaus for execution.
The great problem of dealing with the
federal organization is its heterogeneous
nature, and this must be dealt with by
dividing the work into departments
which will have single or very closely
allied aims, and thus enable a more
systematic apportionment of government
work.
