# HERBERT HOOVER, WILL IRWIN TO TALK TO ALUMNI BY RADIO
## Messages from Prominent Alumni to Be Sent By Wireless Telephone; Magnavox Placed In Pavilion 
### 
Herbert Hoover and Will Irwin will send messages by wireless telephone
to the visiting alumni at the banquet in the pavilion, Saturday night. Pro
fessor Harris J. Ryan of the Electrical Engineering Department, who is to
have charge of this part of the program, will install a Magnavox in the build
ing in order that the message may be heard in all parts of the house. The
receiving set which Professor Ryan will use was given to the University by
the Colin B. Kennedy Company of San Francisco, through Dr. Leonard F.
Fuller, a Stanford man, who is vice president and chief engineer of the com
pany. This receiving set has the widest receiving range of any instrument
devised.
The annual class processional will be one of the outstanding events of
University Day. So far acceptance from every class from '93 to '22, have been
received and it is hoped that the one truant, the class of '93, may also be

represented. The processional led
by the class of '22, will file past a
Pathe motion picture camera and rep
roductions of the march will be sent
to alumni clubs throughout the coun
try. The procession will begin at 2
o'clock and all alumni are requested
to be there at that time whether they
attend the luncheon at the president's
home or not.
