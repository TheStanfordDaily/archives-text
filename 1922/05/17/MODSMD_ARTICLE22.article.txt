# NO FIGHTING ALLOWED
## 
### 
The baseball fight is gone and no more will the
sophomores and freshmen mingle in friendly com
bat to delight the audience of upperclassmen and a
few outsiders. Some will howl that another good
old tradition has gone to hell and the crepe hangers
■will point to the sure decline of Stanford spirit
which is evinced in doing away with the things that
have marked the seasons of a score or so of past
years.
The decision of the Executive Committee did not
come as any surprise, though. After the fight this
year it was agreed by most of the sober minds that
the struggle had reached a point where it was doing
no good and there was a question if there was not
some harm being done. This year the fight stood
for nothing more than a place for a couple of
grudges to be worked off at the expense of many
innocent contenders, and a show for the onlookers.
There was none of the generalship which has been
the biggest part of preceding fights and no keen
competition was entered into to outsly the other
side, so as to bring the figjht on to easy terms for
•one side or the other.
Skull and Snakes went on record as being against
the fight. President W ilbur showed conclusively
that there was nothing left in the fight which mer
ited its being left longer on tjie calendar of events.
,'Sonae said the fight itself was all right, and so it was
as far as efforts went for the hour or so of the
actual scrap. But against that the whole day and
a day or so earlier was interfered with by the com
ing of the fight, and in the spring, when the weeks
arc so full, there is no place for something which
has no direct value in at least some line more worthy
than making a riot scene for the benefit of a number
of not particularly interested students.
The fight in the fall has a distinctly different pur
pose. The two classes, being gathered together at
two respective camps, get a chance to form acquaint
ances in the case of the freshmen and to renew old
friendships in the case of the sophomores. The two
struggles are not at all in the same category as far
as worthwhileness is concerned, and there is no
need to say that the poster fight is doomed to follow
the baseball scrap unless the former fails to be of
any use other than for a mere fight, and that is
hardly possible to contemplate at the present.
