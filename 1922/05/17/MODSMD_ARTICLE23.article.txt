# EVIDENTLY SOME DRAWBACK

From the number x>f letters that Alumni Secretary
McDowell is receiving', the alumni must be coming
back en masse. This year, as at no other time, there
has been made an appeal to the alumni body to come
back to the campus for one day and get in touch
with the current of undergraduate life once more.
As much as they keep in touch with the University,
through the medium of the publications, they can
not keep up with the local life unless they come
back and see for themselves. Although we may be
doing practically the same things as they did when
they were here, things have changed a lot and new
buildings have been put up, so that the man who
has not been here for ten years will be very much
surprised to look around and find that he doesn't
know many of the new places.
The seniors will be given a chance to get into the
hall with the alumni for the dance. This will bring
the two bodies closer together and tighten the bond
lhat exists between Stanford, undergraduate, and
alumni.
