"See the pretty man out in the field —he's making hay
while the sun shines."
"Aw, that's nothing. Father knows a guy who makes
corn while the moon shines."

"Of all flat-footed, chicken-livered imbeciles," ex
ploded Hugo, the midnight moth, "the prize fishcake is
the fellow who says we shouldn't enter a track team

Pity the author. If you can't, shoot him on sight and
pity him afterward. He has a hard and fast life. When
he tries something new, the mob howls: "Where does
he get this futuristic stuff? Trying to brow us, is he?
Give us the good old-fashioned opera for ours."
And when he comes through with something good
and old the same bunch breaks out with: "Moo! Take
it away! We've saw it somewlieres before."

Well, how nice. Sophomores are going to give a big
ice cream social next week. If you don't like ice
cream, you can have an Eskino Pie (you're quite right;
we don't like the things); if it's raining, you can get
under an orange dome; it it's breezy, you can have a
lemon spray; if it's hot, you can have a hot caramel
sundae; if it's dark, you can have a chance to sneak
out the rear.
Nevertheless, we hereby do a back-dive from the key
board and sound the keynote of warning. Queeners, be
ware of the sophomore sirens. They'll sure lyre you
onto the rocks unless you stuff your pockets with wax
dimes. If Buffalo Bill was alive today, he'd pass out
by tonight, in competition—fifteen buffalo specials an
hours is their average. —Advt., naturally.

NOW IT CAN BE TOLD
Shh! Don't tell a soul. I am about to disclose some
of the most sacred secrets of diplomacy, things which
over two million people speak of only in a whisper. If
anybody should ever find out that this has been pub
lished, all would be lost. Nevertheless, on the occasion
when I walked right into the presence of the President
of the Student Body, and he shook me by the hand, I
felt that here was a man that the world should know
more about. And as I walked out and he pulled me by
the leg, I felt it even more strongly.
There are several unexplainable things about the situ
ation in that momentous year. I shall not attempt to
explain them. But as the Dean of Women remarked
on that historic occasion when I sent her a box of
candy, C. O. D.: "This is too much." So I feel it in
cumbent upon me, standing in the position I did at that
time, to say something. If for 110 other reason, to
correct the impression that in my famous interview
with the Comptroller, I lent him five cents to get a
package of gum (at the time I had only four cents and
a lozenge, which the proprietor would not accept.)
You all remember the auspicious manner in which that
year was rung in—the fights, battles, scuffles, scrim
mages, skirmishes, clashes, crashes, and crushes, which
marked the opening engagements. I will not mention
'them. But it was in that year, nevertheless, that it
happened; and Launcelot Lumb was a changed man,
even to his sox. For I happen to know, having had
access to several documents which have remained hid
den in the files, unseen to all save the filing clerks, just
how the great president, the man who changed the en
tire course of a university just before he flunked it —
how, I repeat, he was elected to office. He was elected
—I hesitate to reveal such political weakness, because
he never borrowed a dollar from his friends —(of course;
they weren't his friends afterwards).
* • *
Cabbages offers a prize of one peso and fifteen rubles,
which came into the' business office last year on a bad
debt, to the courageous youth who arrives on the Quad
in a sport shirt. We also offer a second prize of three
marks, one kopek, and two pins if he gets off again
whole.
* * *
If the conscientious frosli who showed up the other
day in ice cream pants will call at the office, we shall
also give him several marks of our appreciation. (James,
is Big Bertha ready?)

RED HOT KNOWLEDGE
The poor girl was weeping furiously. She had tried
smiling demurely, and that had fallen flat; so she had
to do something. Catching the tender-hearted correct
or's eye, she sobbed: "Oh-h-h! I'm all broken up! (busi
ness of powdering nose through tears —a most intrigu
ing, mess). I am going to my fiance's cremation this
afternoon. He was so warm-hearted!" Frowzy Florence
sees her chance. Catching the corrector's hand, she also
weeps furiously up his sleeve, bawling:" Aweouw-w-w!
It's—Blub —awful! Here I'm left all alone, and she's got
sweethearts to burn!" Whereupon the instructor leaves
the room in a big heat, and gives them both 90 in the
shade.

How to Greet the Returning Alumnus.
"Well, well, old top (resounding clap on the collar
bone), glad to see you've come back to take a last look
at the old school —heh, heh, heh! Sit down in that
rocker and rest your bones while I get you a glass or
water. Well, I guess you'll find the old place pretty
much changed since your time. Let's see, must be over
a quarter of a century, isn't it —well, well, well. So you
were stroke for the crew; must say you don't look it.
Time will tell, eh. But then, the athletes in those days
were not like the athletes today, were they? At that,
you're looking right well for your age. Have a stick
of gum?"

Well, how nice. Sophomores are going to give a big
ice cream social next week. If you don't like ice
cream, you can have an Eskino Pie (you're quite right;
we don't like the things); if it's raining, you can get
under an orange dome; it it's breezy, you can have a
lemon spray; if it's hot, you can have a hot caramel
sundae; if it's dark, you can have a chance to sneak
out the rear.

by tonight, in competition—fifteen buffalo specials an

NOW IT CAN BE TOLD
Shh! Don't tell a soul. I am about to disclose some
of the most sacred secrets of diplomacy, things which
over two million people speak of only in a whisper. If
anybody should ever find out that this has been pub
lished, all would be lost. Nevertheless, on the occasion
when I walked right into the presence of the President
of the Student Body, and he shook me by the hand, I
felt that here was a man that the world should know
more about. And as I walked out and he pulled me by
the leg, I felt it even more strongly.
There are several unexplainable things about the situ
ation in that momentous year. I shall not attempt to
explain them. But as the Dean of Women remarked
on that historic occasion when I sent her a box of
candy, C. O. D.: "This is too much." So I feel it in
cumbent upon me, standing in the position I did at that
time, to say something. If for 110 other reason, to
correct the impression that in my famous interview
with the Comptroller, I lent him five cents to get a
package of gum (at the time I had only four cents and
a lozenge, which the proprietor would not accept.)
You all remember the auspicious manner in which that
year was rung in—the fights, battles, scuffles, scrim
mages, skirmishes, clashes, crashes, and crushes, which
marked the opening engagements. I will not mention
'them. But it was in that year, nevertheless, that it
happened; and Launcelot Lumb was a changed man,
even to his sox. For I happen to know, having had
access to several documents which have remained hid
den in the files, unseen to all save the filing clerks, just
how the great president, the man who changed the en
tire course of a university just before he flunked it —
how, I repeat, he was elected to office. He was elected
—I hesitate to reveal such political weakness, because
he never borrowed a dollar from his friends —(of course;
they weren't his friends afterwards).

RED HOT KNOWLEDGE
The poor girl was weeping furiously. She had tried
smiling demurely, and that had fallen flat; so she had
to do something. Catching the tender-hearted correct
or's eye, she sobbed: "Oh-h-h! I'm all broken up! (busi
ness of powdering nose through tears —a most intrigu
ing, mess). I am going to my fiance's cremation this
afternoon. He was so warm-hearted!" Frowzy Florence
sees her chance. Catching the corrector's hand, she also
weeps furiously up his sleeve, bawling:" Aweouw-w-w!
It's—Blub —awful! Here I'm left all alone, and she's got
sweethearts to burn!" Whereupon the instructor leaves
the room in a big heat, and gives them both 90 in the
shade.

Well, how nice. Sophomores are going to give a big

cream, you can have an Eskino Pie (you're quite right;
we don't like the things); if it's raining, you can get

NOW IT CAN BE TOLD
Shh! Don't tell a soul. I am about to disclose some
of the most sacred secrets of diplomacy, things which
over two million people speak of only in a whisper. If
anybody should ever find out that this has been pub
lished, all would be lost. Nevertheless, on the occasion
when I walked right into the presence of the President
of the Student Body, and he shook me by the hand, I
felt that here was a man that the world should know
more about. And as I walked out and he pulled me by
the leg, I felt it even more strongly.
There are several unexplainable things about the situ
ation in that momentous year. I shall not attempt to
explain them. But as the Dean of Women remarked
on that historic occasion when I sent her a box of
candy, C. O. D.: "This is too much." So I feel it in
cumbent upon me, standing in the position I did at that
time, to say something. If for 110 other reason, to
correct the impression that in my famous interview
with the Comptroller, I lent him five cents to get a
package of gum (at the time I had only four cents and
a lozenge, which the proprietor would not accept.)
You all remember the auspicious manner in which that
year was rung in—the fights, battles, scuffles, scrim
mages, skirmishes, clashes, crashes, and crushes, which
marked the opening engagements. I will not mention
'them. But it was in that year, nevertheless, that it
