To the Editor: —I would like to cor
rect an article that appeared in yester
day's issue, as follows: "Chester
Thomas ,'9B, who died in 1920, was a
graduate of the Civil Engineering de
partment and had business interests
in the Yukon Territory."
"Chet" Thomas graduated from the
department of Geology and Mining, and
left for active service in the Philip
pine Islands with the American Army,
without waiting for the graduation ex
ercises. He was Chief Engineer of
the United Verde Copper Company, at
Jerome, Arizona, 1889-1904; Resident
Manager of the Yukon Gold Company
at Dawson, Yukon Territory, Canada,
1904-1905; Assistant to Vice-President,
Sell)}; Smelting and Refining Company,
San Francisco, 1919-20. He resigned
from the last position because of ill
health, caused by a recurrence of a
tropical disease incurred while in the
Philippines. During his long stay in
Dawson, he was well liked by all who
knew him, was always a "Stanford
Man," and was the cause of others
traveling three thousand odd miles to
become "Students at Stanford."
Respectfully submitted,
