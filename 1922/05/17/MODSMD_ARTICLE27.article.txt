Edna Hawkenson Speaks
nt College of the Pacific
Edna Hawkenson, '22, spoke to the
women students at the College of the
Pacific yesterday on "The National
Convention of the Y. W. C. A. at Hot
Springs." As the College of the Pa
cific did not send a representative to
Hot Springs, Miss Hawkenson gave
them a summary of the work accomp
lished at the conventionâ€”particularly
that of the student department.
