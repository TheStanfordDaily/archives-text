# Benefit Bridge Tea To Be Given in Clubhouse
## 
### 
A benefit bridge-tea will be given
by the Board of Directors of the Wom
en's Clubhouse, Thursday, May 18,
from 3 to 6, for the purpose of raising
money to pay off the debt incurred by
the borrowing of the necessary funds
for the building of the clubhouse.
The proceeds received from the
Resident Alumnae Teas, which are
held every Wednesday, go toward
furnishings and improvements and
take no part in the paying of either
interest or the debt.
Although the Board of Directors
pays five hundred dollars of the prin
cipal each year there is still a large
debt and it is earnestly hoped that
the women will rouse to the support of
the tea. Tea will be served for 25
cents and tickets for cards may be
secured for 50 cents which will include
tea. Table reservations may be made
through Mrs. Ewell at the clubhouse,
telephone Palo Alto 177, or through
any of the directors.
