"Hist! We ride tonight, men! Bring
the sheets to the graveyard at 8. Shovels
will be provided."
Ahh! The fiery summons—or what
ever it is they use to get the klansmen
off the dime. The noble knights of the
Ku Klux are out again. Their ranks
arc swelling—the ranker the better —
their numbers increase.
The Ku Klux number of Chaparral,
which is Chappie's next and final issue,
will be out in June. The Old Boy dons
the robes of Supreme Cyclops, and,
blowing a fiery blast up his sleeves, calls
out all the little kleagles in full cry.
Editor Tom Carskadon, in the role of
Grand Kleagle, sends out a fiery kail for
kopy. Hist! Send all kracks to Box
15, Campus, not later than Monday.
