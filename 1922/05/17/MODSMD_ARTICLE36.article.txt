### 
During Queen Victoria's reign Sir
Spenser St. John was minister resident
and consul-general in Haiti. While he
was living in Port-au-Prince, Sir St.
John collected the material for "Hayti,
or the Black Republic," an edition which
has been placed on the new book shelf
at the Library.
Sir St. John's book gives the history
of Haiti to the year 1879. The first part
of this volume sets forth a general de
scription of Haiti and an account of the
island before and after its independence.
The last chapters discuss Vaudoux wor
ship, cannibalism, government, education,
the army and police system of the island,
Haitian languages and literature.
Another new book, which was given to
the Library by the Indian government is
"India in 1920." The material for this
publication was compiled by L. F. R.
Williams, director of the central bureau
of information of the government of
India. This book contains a discussion
of India and her neighbors, an account
of the economic life of In<Jia and the
Indian people and the relation of the
people to the government.
