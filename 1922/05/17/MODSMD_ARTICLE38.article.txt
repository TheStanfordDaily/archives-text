# EXHIBIT OF MODERN FRENCH ETCHINGS IS NOW AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
Modern French etchings are now on
exhibit in the Stanford Art Gallery in
order to give the public an idea of what
progress is being made in France along
this line.
A group of hard ground etchings, done
by Steinlen, are considered the best on
display and one of the most interesting
examples is "Les Trois Compagnons."
Steinlen is known as a very rapid worker
and his style is often compared to Mil
let's, because both men concentrate on
the portrayal of peasant life.
Two lithographed heads by Carriere
are particularly interesting, as he has
worked from a different standpoint.
Closely resembling the impressionistic
style of the American futurist are the
examples of Gauguin. M. Gauguin lived
for some years in Tahiti and was, toward
the end of his life .mentally unbalanced.
Although his work contains some unique
ideas the later etchings seem grotesque
and weird almost bordering on absurdity.
Two of Gauguin's later works are "Auti
Te Pape" and "Maruru."
Closely resembling crayon work on
heavy paper is the display of H. Fantin-
Latour. The biggest charm of M. La
tour's work lies in its rarity, there being
only seven proofs of one of the etchings,
the plate then being destroyed.
The reproduction of a dozen litho
graphs from old French joke books are
valuable to the public, although they are
merely printed on magazine paper, be
cause of their age, some of them being
taken from comic journals dating as far
back as 1841.
Mr. Lemos states that the displays are
not always an expression of any standard
set by the art gallery buf are put there
so that the American people may see and
understand the style used by modern
French etchers.
