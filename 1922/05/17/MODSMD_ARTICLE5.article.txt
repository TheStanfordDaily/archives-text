# First Report of Clean-Up In Campus Endowment Announced by Canvassers
## 
### 
Results of the first night's "clean-up"
on the student endowment campaign,
given at a meeting of the committees in
the Union last evening, showed a total of
$2680, contributed by 52 students. This
report was incomplete owing to many of
the workers holding their cards until all
on the list have been covered. Sequoia
and the campus group made no report
for the same reason.
With preliminaries out of the way,
the big effort is to be made today and
tomorrow, in order to present a report
of better than 90 per cent contribution
toward the fund to the alumni on Satur
day. The next report supper will be
held Thursday at 7 o'clock in the Union,
at which it is hoped to have a majority
of the 864 prospects interviewed. This
meeting is open to all canvassers listed.
The program calls for a completion of
business inside of an hour.
