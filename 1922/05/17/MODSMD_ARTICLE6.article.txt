# BARDS ARE ORIGIN OF STADIUM OPERA
## 
### 
Stanford and California student hands
which participated in the "Big Game" in
the stadium last fall, furnished the germ
of the idea which ha* matured into the
open-air grand opera to he held ifi the
bowl June, 3, 7, 10 and 16. Gaetano
Merola, who was associated with the
late Oscar Hammerstein in his eastern
grand opera enterprises, was an inter
ested spectator at this game.
Merola's enthusiasm over the acoustics
of the stadium resulted in his outlining
to President Wilbur the possibilities of
holding musical recitals in the great
bowl. Dr. Wilbur was immediately in
terested, and so brought the matter to
the attention of the Board of Athletic
Control.
During the winter frequent complaints
were heard from music lovers in San
Francisco because of the lack of a suit
able opera house in that city. As a re
sult, the present musical program was
planned, with the Stanford endowment
fund, the fund for the enlargement of
the organ in the Memorial Church, the
Stanford Clinics in San Francisco and
the Home for Convalescent Children on
the campus as the beneficiaries in the
proceeds.
Gaetano Merola, under whose direc
tion the entire production is being staged,
is enthusiastic over the prospects. "1
have been connected with the production
of grand opera all my life, and in many
different countries," lie declares, "but I
have never been identified with a pro
duction that promises so muoh, not only
from an operatic standpoint but from a
scenic and artistic standpoint.
"For instance," he explained, "when
the toreador steps upon the stage in
'Carmen,' we are able to show not only
the gate through which he enters, but,
by means of the lighting system, the
road over which he has traveled. Un
excelled beauties of scenery meet the eye
at every angle. Some of the stage set
tings will be concealed through skillful
arrangement of the lights, until they be
come important in the unfolding of the
story. Then they will become suddenly
illuminated."
Investigation of the stadium by archi
tects has shown that all the advantages
possessed by a regular theater can be
obtained by the construction of the stage
across the northern end of the bowl.
This work is now under way. The stage
will measure more than eighty feet in
length, which is three times as large as
the biggest theater stage in San Fran
cisco.
The lighting effects for the grand
opera productions are being worked out
by Ray Coyle. He has devised a plan of
eliminating the regulation theatrical cur
tain by making use of a "barrage" of
lights, which he declares, will effectually
shield the stage from the view of the
spectators while scene shifters are per
forming their work. Real trees, instead
of painted ones, will be used in the
scenery.
In the "pit" directly in front of the
stage there will be placed 1000 five-dollar
scats. The seats in the first 25 rows of
the bleachers have been priced at three
dollars each, those in the next 20 rows
at two dollars, with the balance selling
for one dollar each.

"For instance," he explained, "when
the toreador steps upon the stage in
'Carmen,' we are able to show not only
the gate through which he enters, but,
by means of the lighting system, the
road over which he has traveled. Un
excelled beauties of scenery meet the eye
at every angle. Some of the stage set
tings will be concealed through skillful
arrangement of the lights, until they be
come important in the unfolding of the
story. Then they will become suddenly
illuminated."
Investigation of the stadium by archi
tects has shown that all the advantages
possessed by a regular theater can be
obtained by the construction of the stage
across the northern end of the bowl.
This work is now under way. The stage
will measure more than eighty feet in
length, which is three times as large as
the biggest theater stage in San Fran
cisco.
The lighting effects for the grand
opera productions are being worked out
by Ray Coyle. He has devised a plan of
eliminating the regulation theatrical cur
tain by making use of a "barrage" of
lights, which he declares, will effectually
shield the stage from the view of the
spectators while scene shifters are per
forming their work. Real trees, instead
of painted ones, will be used in the
scenery.
In the "pit" directly in front of the
stage there will be placed 1000 five-dollar
scats. The seats in the first 25 rows of
the bleachers have been priced at three
dollars each, those in the next 20 rows
at two dollars, with the balance selling
for one dollar each.
Stanford and California student hands
which participated in the "Big Game" in
the stadium last fall, furnished the germ
of the idea which ha* matured into the
open-air grand opera to he held ifi the
bowl June, 3, 7, 10 and 16. Gaetano
Merola, who was associated with the
late Oscar Hammerstein in his eastern
grand opera enterprises, was an inter
ested spectator at this game.
Merola's enthusiasm over the acoustics
of the stadium resulted in his outlining
to President Wilbur the possibilities of
holding musical recitals in the great
bowl. Dr. Wilbur was immediately in
terested, and so brought the matter to
the attention of the Board of Athletic
Control.
During the winter frequent complaints
were heard from music lovers in San
Francisco because of the lack of a suit
able opera house in that city. As a re
sult, the present musical program was
planned, with the Stanford endowment
fund, the fund for the enlargement of
the organ in the Memorial Church, the
Stanford Clinics in San Francisco and
the Home for Convalescent Children on
the campus as the beneficiaries in the
proceeds.
