# THIRD LABOR DAY IS OBSERVED AT OLD STANFORD MANSION
## Students Given Half Holiday to Clean Up Grounds About Convalescent Home Today 
### 
More than a thousand students armed
with hoes, rakes, shovels and axes in
vaded the Children's Convalescent Home
this afternoon and cleared the grounds
about the bouse of weeds, underbrush
and dead trees.
Men marched to the Home in two
bodies. One line started from the Delta
Tau Delta house under "Chet" Douglas.
The second line, in charge of "Bob" Con
nolly and "Lou" Minsky, started from

and Roble for the women at 1 :30.
Laborers were divided into four
groups when they reached the Home.
The women were placed in charge of the
garden in rear of the house. One group
of men chopped down dead trees and
trimmed others along the road in front
of the house. A second group of men
cleared the weeds from the roads in
front of the house and the r.oad leading
to the highway. A third group hauled
grass, which bad been cut away from the
trees, to San Francisquito Creek in
wagons.
Owing to the large number of stu
dents that turned out, the work was com
pleted in a comparatively short time.
The Stanford Band furnished music all

done. When the labor was finished,
dinner was served. As no meals arc
being served at any of the fraternities,
sororities or clubs this evening, all the
living groups were assessed to help pay

The menu consisted of mutton, barbe-
cued under the direction of Sam Mc-
Donald, sandwiches, coffee and ice
cream.

gram was presented. The Glee Club

and Mcrtz gave a saxophone duet. Ar

More than a thousand students armed
with hoes, rakes, shovels and axes in
vaded the Children's Convalescent Home
this afternoon and cleared the grounds
about the bouse of weeds, underbrush
and dead trees.
Men marched to the Home in two
bodies. One line started from the Delta
Tau Delta house under "Chet" Douglas.
The second line, in charge of "Bob" Con
nolly and "Lou" Minsky, started from
Encina and was joined by men from Se
quoia. Trucks called at the sororities
and Roble for the women at 1 :30.
Laborers were divided into four
groups when they reached the Home.
The women were placed in charge of the
garden in rear of the house. One group
of men chopped down dead trees and
trimmed others along the road in front
of the house. A second group of men
cleared the weeds from the roads in
front of the house and the r.oad leading
to the highway. A third group hauled
grass, which bad been cut away from the
trees, to San Francisquito Creek in
wagons.
Owing to the large number of stu
dents that turned out, the work was com
pleted in a comparatively short time.
The Stanford Band furnished music all
afternoon while the work was being
done. When the labor was finished,
dinner was served. As no meals arc
being served at any of the fraternities,
sororities or clubs this evening, all the
living groups were assessed to help pay
for the food. Each sorority made five
dozen sandwiches and all fraternities
and clubs were assessed three dollars.
The menu consisted of mutton, barbe-
cued under the direction of Sam Mc-
Donald, sandwiches, coffee and ice
cream.
Following dinner, an impromptu pro
gram was presented. The Glee Club
quartet gave several selections, Alabaster
and Mcrtz gave a saxophone duet. Ar
nold Bayley presented some of his imita
tions, "Tex" Talbert dejivered a negro
sermon, and Les Seib staged a specialty
song and dance act.
