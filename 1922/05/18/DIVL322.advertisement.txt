Obviously—
The four in the background
have risked an eye—who
but a dog wouldn't—
For the engaging one in the
foreground is wearing an English
Chenille Sports Frock and an air
of insouciance—both of which

taffeta appearing in unexpected

gold, tomato-and-grey, copen-and
gold, and black-and-grey. The
price is miraculously low.'
