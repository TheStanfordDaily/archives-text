# U.C. Professor Attacks University Curriculums
## 
### 
"The majority of graduates from
universities and colleges throughout the
country are being turned out unfitted
for careers because of the lack of mod
ern teachings in curriculums," declared
Professor Frederick Teggert of the so
cial institutions department of the Uni
versity of California. The statement
was made in an address delivered to
members of Phi Beta Kappa entitled,
"The Next Thirty Years."
"University instruction," continued
Professor Teggert, "should appeal to
the humanities instead of the reviewing
of dead languages and old documents.
These are of little use to those living in
the present day.
"Within the academic walls there are
innumerable indications of waverings
and hesitations. The activities of stu
dents of the present time arc marked by
doubts, hesitations, questionings, shift
ings of interest, and experimenting with
new possibilities of academic work."
