# GLEE CLUB TRIP TO MEXICO IS PROPOSED
## 
### 
The summer trip of the Stanford Glee
Club to Mexico as the guest of the
Mexican Republic may become a reality,
if satisfactory financial arrange
ments can be made, according to
Charles Sortor, '23, manager of the
club, who is now corresponding in an
effort to make the necessary steps pre
liminary to the trip. A meeting of the
club has been called this afternoon for
4:45, in Room 84, at which time the
matter will be discussed.
Over twenty men have indicated a
desire to make the trip if it is finally
arranged.
President Obregon of Mexico invited
the club to come to Mexico as the guest
of the Nation and of the universities
over six months ago, but this is the first
time opportunity has presented itself for
the trip.
