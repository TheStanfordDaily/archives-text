# Cardinal Track Squad Will Start On Eastern Pilgrimage Tomorrow
## COACH TEMPLETON AND TEN CINDER PATH STARS LEAVE OAKLAND ON CENTURY LIMITED 
### 
Accompanied by Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton and Manager Marion Grothe, ten
Cardinal track stars—comprising the
largest Stanford sqtiad that has ever
undertaken a transcontinental journey—
leave Oakland tomorrow morning at
11 :30 on the Overland Limited for the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Harvard.
The men and the events which they
will enter follow: Captain Hanner,
javelin; Falk, hurdles; Hayes, hurdles;
Kirksey, 220-yard dash; Sudden, 100
and 200-yard dashes; Williamson, quar
ter mile; Daly, half mile; Hartranft,
shot put and discus; Black, pole vault;
and Minsky, broad jump.
Judah, the fast quarter-miler, whose
last-minute entry had been considered
possible, will not make the trip, it was

announced at the Graduate Manager's
office this morning.
Templeton and his men arc due tt>
arrive in Chicago Monday morning, and
will go from there direct to Boston.
The Cardinal squad will have its first
opportunity to limber up at the Harvard
Stadium on Wednesday, with the pre
liminary heats scheduled for Friday.
Stanford will have at least one entry
in all but three of the events—the mile,
two mile, and high jump. Led by Cap
tain Hanner, the Cardinal team, despite
injuries to several of its members, has
a "fighting chance" to wrest the national
title from California.
Two of the Cardinals are no strang
ers to I. C. A. A. A. A. competition.
Kirksey, a two-time winner in the 100-
yard dash, is unable to defend his title
this year on account of an injured leg,
and he is still far from the form which
made him the second best sprinter in
the world in 1920 and 1921. The prowess
of Falk is well recognized throughout
the East, and the captain-elect is con
ceded first in the 220 lows by some of
the sporting writers.
The other eight, in spite of the fact
