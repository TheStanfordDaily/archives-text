# Cardinal Track Squad Will Start On Eastern Pilgrimage Tomorrow
## COACH TEMPLETON AND TEN CINDER PATH STARS LEAVE OAKLAND ON CENTURY LIMITED 
### 
Accompanied by Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton and Manager Marion Grothe, ten
Cardinal track stars—comprising the
largest Stanford sqtiad that has ever
undertaken a transcontinental journey—
leave Oakland tomorrow morning at
11 :30 on the Overland Limited for the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Harvard.
The men and the events which they
will enter follow: Captain Hanner,
javelin; Falk, hurdles; Hayes, hurdles;
Kirksey, 220-yard dash; Sudden, 100
and 200-yard dashes; Williamson, quar
ter mile; Daly, half mile; Hartranft,
shot put and discus; Black, pole vault;
and Minsky, broad jump.
Judah, the fast quarter-miler, whose
last-minute entry had been considered
possible, will not make the trip, it was

announced at the Graduate Manager's
office this morning.
Templeton and his men arc due tt>
arrive in Chicago Monday morning, and
will go from there direct to Boston.
The Cardinal squad will have its first
opportunity to limber up at the Harvard
Stadium on Wednesday, with the pre
liminary heats scheduled for Friday.
Stanford will have at least one entry
in all but three of the events—the mile,
two mile, and high jump. Led by Cap
tain Hanner, the Cardinal team, despite
injuries to several of its members, has
a "fighting chance" to wrest the national
title from California.
Two of the Cardinals are no strang
ers to I. C. A. A. A. A. competition.
Kirksey, a two-time winner in the 100-
yard dash, is unable to defend his title
this year on account of an injured leg,
and he is still far from the form which
made him the second best sprinter in
the world in 1920 and 1921. The prowess
of Falk is well recognized throughout
the East, and the captain-elect is con
ceded first in the 220 lows by some of
the sporting writers.
The other eight, in spite of the fact
that some of them have coast-wide repu
tations, are just "possibilities" and it is
on them that Stanford's chances for vic
tory depend. Hartranft, with his sen
sational early-season marks in the shot
and discus, is counted on for ten points
in those events. Sudden, in the opihion
of Paddock, will lead the way in the
100-yard dash to the 75-yard mark. If,
in his training at Pasadena, the Car
dinal sprinter has acquired a finish that
will measure up to his start, he should
win. Black's 12 feet 9 inches, and
Hayes' time in the low hurdles seem to
guarantee these two places.
Manner, still bothered by a sore arm,
which handicapped him in the recent P.
A. A. meet at Berkeley, will compete
against a high-class field. If he is
"right," the Stanford captain can best
any javelin thrower in the country.
Williamson seems sure of a place in the
440, unless he is affected by the change
of climate. He has already defeated
Hendrixson, the national champion, in
the Big Meet, but the Bruin star is a
great competition runner, and will be
at his best for championships.
Of Daly and Minsky, there is little
expected by the general sporting public
—any points scored by either of them
will be an unexpected boost. Larry
Shields of Pennsylvania travels the half
mile in 1 :55, and is favored to win.
Daly, however, has run in 1 :58 and he
may be able, with such a pace-setter, to
break in among the first three or four.
If Minsky can approach his mark of 22
feet 7 in the California meet, he will
have an even chance of placing.

Templeton and his men arc due tt>
arrive in Chicago Monday morning, and
will go from there direct to Boston.
The Cardinal squad will have its first
opportunity to limber up at the Harvard
Stadium on Wednesday, with the pre
liminary heats scheduled for Friday.
Stanford will have at least one entry
in all but three of the events—the mile,
two mile, and high jump. Led by Cap
tain Hanner, the Cardinal team, despite
injuries to several of its members, has
a "fighting chance" to wrest the national
title from California.
Two of the Cardinals are no strang
ers to I. C. A. A. A. A. competition.
Kirksey, a two-time winner in the 100-
yard dash, is unable to defend his title
this year on account of an injured leg,
and he is still far from the form which
made him the second best sprinter in
the world in 1920 and 1921. The prowess
of Falk is well recognized throughout
the East, and the captain-elect is con
ceded first in the 220 lows by some of
the sporting writers.
The other eight, in spite of the fact
that some of them have coast-wide repu
tations, are just "possibilities" and it is
on them that Stanford's chances for vic
tory depend. Hartranft, with his sen
sational early-season marks in the shot
and discus, is counted on for ten points
in those events. Sudden, in the opihion
of Paddock, will lead the way in the
100-yard dash to the 75-yard mark. If,
in his training at Pasadena, the Car
dinal sprinter has acquired a finish that
will measure up to his start, he should
win. Black's 12 feet 9 inches, and
Hayes' time in the low hurdles seem to
guarantee these two places.
Manner, still bothered by a sore arm,
which handicapped him in the recent P.
A. A. meet at Berkeley, will compete
against a high-class field. If he is
"right," the Stanford captain can best
any javelin thrower in the country.
Williamson seems sure of a place in the
440, unless he is affected by the change
of climate. He has already defeated
Hendrixson, the national champion, in
the Big Meet, but the Bruin star is a
great competition runner, and will be
at his best for championships.
Of Daly and Minsky, there is little
expected by the general sporting public
—any points scored by either of them
will be an unexpected boost. Larry
Shields of Pennsylvania travels the half
mile in 1 :55, and is favored to win.
Daly, however, has run in 1 :58 and he
may be able, with such a pace-setter, to
break in among the first three or four.
If Minsky can approach his mark of 22
feet 7 in the California meet, he will
have an even chance of placing.
Accompanied by Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton and Manager Marion Grothe, ten
Cardinal track stars—comprising the
largest Stanford sqtiad that has ever
undertaken a transcontinental journey—
leave Oakland tomorrow morning at
11 :30 on the Overland Limited for the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Harvard.
The men and the events which they
will enter follow: Captain Hanner,
javelin; Falk, hurdles; Hayes, hurdles;
Kirksey, 220-yard dash; Sudden, 100
and 200-yard dashes; Williamson, quar
ter mile; Daly, half mile; Hartranft,
shot put and discus; Black, pole vault;
and Minsky, broad jump.
Judah, the fast quarter-miler, whose
last-minute entry had been considered
possible, will not make the trip, it was

announced at the Graduate Manager's
office this morning.
