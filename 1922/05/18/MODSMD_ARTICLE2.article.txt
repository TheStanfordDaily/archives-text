# Alumni Tear Loose In "Other Days" Number of Chappie, on Sale Friday
## 
### 
How they did it in the days when Stan
ford was only a pup and wild and woolly.
All this and more is dealt with in the
literary contributions by alumni which
will grace the pages of the "Other Days"
number of Chaparral, which makes its
appearance on the quad tomorrow.
Charlie Field, '95, Milt Hagen, '15, and
"Hep" Levy, '16, donate their voices in
celebration of the big alumni smash-up
this week-end. In addition, there will
be featured three full pages of cartoons
from the pen of "Feg" Murray, '16.
