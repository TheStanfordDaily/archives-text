# GUNNERY TESTS GIVEN TO R.O.T.C. FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Forty-five men in the Stanford Re
serve Officers' Training Corps unit are
now taking the preliminary tests lead
ing to qualification as gunner, as a
portion of the basic course. A ma
jority of the men have qualified so far
as expert first class gunner, while there
is a small percentage of first and sec
ond class gunners.
The tests comprise examination of
the candidates in all subjects dealing
with the aiming of the gun on the
target, stop-watch trials being made
of the man's proficiency in the actual
operation of the gun-sighting mecha
nism, and of the knowledge of the
man of the nomenclature and simple
adjustment of the mechanical features
of the #Un.
According to Captain Cooney, now
conducting the trials, college men
| achieve far greater proficiency in the
gunner's work than is obtained among
regular troops, pointing out that from
twenty men upward qualify each year
out.of the first year course, while the
gunnery specialists from a like body
of regulars are apt to be two or three
in number.
