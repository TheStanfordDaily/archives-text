# PRESIDENT BARROWS' RESIGNATION
## 
### 
After two and a half years of heading the adminis
tration of the University of California, David P.
Barrows has resigned and states his wish to go hack
to the instruction staff in his chosen line, Political
Science. He evidently considers that he has done
the work that was cut out for him when he took the
position as president of the university and now wants
to get back to his subject that he taught for fifteen
years before the war.
It seems that after a man has been in the instruc
tion part of the university for a number of years he
cannot be satisfied with mere administration. In the
Jatter place he has not the intimate association with
the men and women such as comes while serving as
an instructor. President Barrows seems to be dis
satified to be merely serving as an executive.
When Barrows' resignation takes effect next year
it will be difficult to get a man for his place who will
fit so well as Barrows has during the period of un
settled conditions that has been existing during the
war.
