# NO NARROW BENEFIT

At the time when the Endowment Campaign was
on some said they would not give to the endowment
because they thought that it was to he used by Pres
ident Wilbur to force housing conditions that were
not wanted. Where the idea ever originated is hard
to figure, but it has evidently persisted.
As far as the President is concerned, he is only
interested in providing facilities for the best accom
modations possible. No one will be forced out of
any group into living under University regulation,
unless it be the first-year man. The only thing that
will be done will be to provide places that are so
comfortable that they will appeal to people who
appreciate such things.
This objection applies to the second part of the
endowment, however. At the present time we are
interested in improving our curriculum and each of
us should hold it as a duty to himself to see that this
is done to the best of lys ability. What we want is
to sec our record one hundred per cent, and a sub
stantial one in addition. All our effort is not too
much to offer to the ones who are working up the
remainder of the unanswered pledges.
