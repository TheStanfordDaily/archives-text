Sticky's Gigantic Candy Sale will take place next

Climb on, boys. Not only will all other known forms or

Roads will decorate the counters. What with the Clods
and the Rocky Roads and the Soda Water, there ought to
be a fine grade of carbonated mud available. The
Sophomores will also operate the Castor Oil conces
sion.

He was such a good track man that his chest was all
scarred up from breaking the tape. He was always so
far out ahead of the field that he never met his own
team-mates. He was so fast that the timers had to be
double-jointed. He was so good that he had to run
heats to qualify against himself. He ran around the
track so fast that he frequently kicked cinders in his
own face.
He flunked out.

It was a dark, stormy night—the kind of night that
only occurs in a movie studio. However, this was out
on the rolling deep, and the hero was seasick. He
wished he was back in Hollywood. He wished lie had
a gyroscope in his pocket. He wished that he was a
bird. Lord, but he was sick. He felt like a washing
machine. He longed to be an earthworm.
And why was he sick? Yes, gentle reader, you are
right, HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO PAY HIS SYLLA

you are just too late.
