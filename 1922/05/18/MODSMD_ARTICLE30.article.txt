PINCHOT SMASHING REPUBLICAN
MACHINE
Gifford Pinchot. former chief of U. S.
Forestry Bureau, is smashing the Penn
sylvania Republican machine in the pri
mary election for Governor. The de
feat of the Pennsylvania organization, of
which the late Senator Penrose was
chief, may indicate that the political
pendulum is swinging toward liberalism.
But at best it is only another case of a
reformer breaking up a machine—a phe
nomenon as characteristic of the normal
functioning of our political system as
revolutions in Central America are char
acteristic of theirs. The class war now
going on in Chicago, where three union
labor leaders are in jail for murder, as
a result of the death of two police of
ficers in a riot, where the authorities are
deluged with letters threatening a reign
of terror, order are given to "get
the criminals dead or alive," is some
thing of greater significance.
Lloyd George goes on with his at
tempt to salvage the Genoa Conference
by adjourning it to The Hague. He has
not yet given up the hope of having
the U. S. participate in some capacity,
whether as a member of an investigating
commission or of a new conference. A
preliminary pact of non-aggression
which will run for a maximum of eight
months is a part of the project. The
Genoa Conference has definitely failed.
It'has failed because of the political
squabbles of European nations and be
cause of the inherent difficulty of ad
justing their economic relations with
each other, but most of all because cap
italist Western Europe was not willing
to recognize Communist Russia. Lloyd
George held that Russia was no longer
communist; France and Belgium that
she must guarantee that she would no
longer be communist, but no western
power was anxious to see Russia suc
ceed as a communist state. So the
shadow of class warfare hung over
Genoa. We stayed away from Genoa,
but the same shadow hangs over us, as
the situation in Chicago shows only too
well.
