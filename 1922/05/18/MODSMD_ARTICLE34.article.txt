Several of the outstanding performers
in last year's I. C. A. A. A. A. meet are
not entered in this year's competition at
Cambridge. Earl Thompson of Dart
mouth, champion hurdler; Dick Landon,
Yale, high jumper, and Earl Eby of
Penn., stellar middle distance man, will
not compete. Other veterans such as
the Brown brothers at Cornell, in the
distances, will be on hand, together with
what are said to be an unusually clever
crop of newcomers. Much promising
material showed itself in the recent dual
meets between Harvard and Yale, and
Penn and Cornell.
