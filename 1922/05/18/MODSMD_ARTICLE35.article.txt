fornia.
Dr. Suzzalo obtained his master's de

partment the following two years. As
Professor of the Philosophy of Educa
tion at Columbia in 1907, Dr. Suzzalo
worked out some of his own theories of
pedagogical methods. His experience as
president of Washington University has
demonstrated his executive ability.
Dr. Suzzalo is a native of San Jose,
and his California birth and education
are being used as strong arguments for
his selection as successor to Dr. Bar
rows.

of Yale University, is the other leading
probable successor. Both Dr. Angell
and Dr. Suzzalo were considered two
and a half years ago by the Board of

the university, Dr. Benjamin Ide Wheel
er. retired after twenty years' service.
At that time both students and alumni
of the state university expressed the de
sire that a Western man be chosen to
head the institution.

dent David P. Barrows, Morse A. Cart
wright. executive secretary of the Uni
versity of California, yesterday an
nounced his resignation to take effect
June 30, 1923, the same time as that of
Dr. Barrows becomes effective.

[ to the president in 1917 under President
! Benjamin Ide Wheeler After Dr.
Wheeler resigned, Cartwright was
chosen executive secretary of the uni
versity under an administrative board
appointed until a new president could
be named.
Cartwright continued in the position
after Dr. Barrows had been appointed
in 1919. Before becoming affiliated with
the administrative office he was head of
