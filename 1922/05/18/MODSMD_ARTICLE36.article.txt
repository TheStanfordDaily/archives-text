# GARDNER WOOD WILL TALK ON WATER AND POWER BILL TONIGHT
## 
### 
"Why the proposed Water and Power
Act should he defeated at the next gen
eral election," will be the subject of a
lecture by Gardner P. Wood of San
Francisco, at a meeting of Euphronia
Debating Society, to be held at 7:30
this evening in Room 12 of the Law
Building.
Wood is a graduate of the Stanford
Law Department and is a former mem
ber of Euphronia. He is now president
of the Young Men's Republican League
of California and is taking an active part
in the campaign against the Water and
Power Act. Wood will answer the
arguments set forth by Louis Bartlett,
mayor of Berkeley, in his speech here
two weeks ago, advocating the act.
The Water and Power Act, which was
proposed by initiative petition, will be
voted on at the general elections next
autumn. It provides for the issuance of
$500,000,000 worth of bonds for the
purpose of public control and develop
ment of state water and power re
sources. Opponents of the act claim
that it would result in an unnecessary
burden on the public. They point out
that the large number of private cor
porations are fully able to take care of
all necessities of the state as far as
water power is concerned.
Visitors are invited to attend the
meeting this evening.
