# MANY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE MADE UPON STANFORD STADIUM
## 
### 
Various improvements are being made
on the stadium by the Board of Athletic
Control. The vetch which was sowed
on the banks of the stadium last year
as protection against the winter rains
has been removed. The dry grass had
become a fire risk and also was choking
out the plants and small trees. Before
the Big Game next fall rye grass will be
planted on the banks in order to give
them a green appearance. Eventually,
the shrubs and trees will form a thick
covering and no grass will be needed.
A contract has been given to Baker &
Carpenter, construction engineers, to im
prove the esplanade running around the
top of the bowl and the wide road around
the bottom of the stadium inside of the
wire fence. It is probable that the
esplanade will be macadamized, and an
oil surface will be put on the outside
passage. Due to a settling of the earth
at the enclosed end of the bowl a block
of seats buckled up slightly. This is be
ing remedied by jacking up the lumber
and reinforcing the supports. No serious
damage has been caused.
Since the conclusion of spring foot
ball practice an opportunity has been
given to put the turf in first class shape.
The field is being smoothed by rollers
and new grass will be planted in the
thin spots so that a gridiron as near per
fect as possible will be ready for the
1922 football season.
