# MANY FORFEITS AS INTRAMURAL SERIES NEARS FINAL GAMES
## 
### 
'Only one of the scheduled intramural
baseball games took place Thursday
afternoon. Sequoia Team No. One de
feating Alpha Sigma Phi by an over
whelming score in an informal four
inning game. Prior and Brinkman did
battery work for Sequoia, with Moore,
Morrison, and Nicholas on duty for
Alpha Sigma Phi. The end of the in
tramural schedule is- approaching, and
weaker teams seldom show up to
play off their games. On Thursday the
Breakers Club forfeited to Beta Theta
Pi, Sequoia No. Two presented a game
to Alpha Delta Phi, and Theta Chi de
faulted to Alpha Tau Omega.
