Nearly a thousand alumni are coming back to the
"Farm" to enjoy a day which has been set aside
especially for reunions, parties, seeing the campus
as it is now, and the renewing of old acquaintances
maybe a long time forgotten. We students have
been waiting for this day for weeks and have been
working to get everything in readiness for the big
day so that no one could want anything and not be
able to find it around the campus. Members of the
alumni l>ody have been more active this year than
ever before and have been up to their necks in effort
to bring back the old gang to the annual get
together. Jack McDowell, who knows more about
the haunts of most of the alumni than they do them
selves, has worked his old card catalogue to death,
and the results that he has gotten have been astound
ing. When it comes to sending back acceptances in
advance for a day like Alumni Day no one is in a
hurry to respond when he thinks he can just as well
drop down the last minute and be sure Of getting a
place to horn in somewhere. Evidently the fear of
not being able to get seats has gotten into the alumni
body for the acceptances have been crowding the
secretary's office for the past week.
Charlie Field has his show part all lined up and
working fine. There can be no doubt that when you
see it and find out how catchy it is at the climax of
the evening's entertainment you will be some sur
prised. In fact Charlie is always coming across
with surprises.
The Seniors will be on hand to do their best for
you all in the afternoon and all the groups on the
campus want you to come and make yourself at
home while on the campus and meet some of the old
friends that you had in that group when you were
here. There is only one day to make the whole
thing in and so if you don't take advantage of the
time to do all that you can to get around and make
all the stops possible you are missing the chance of
your lifetime. So make her a big day and may there
be many happy returns of the same.
