The Stanford R. O. T. C. will put on a polo game
and have the commissions presented in the morning.
This is the end of the season for the Stanford mili
tary unit and it has been a season of success. The
unit has been characterized as one of the best in the
west and has made a name for itself in competition
with the others of the district.
The polo game in the morning will be the first
thing of the Alumni Day after the ceremony of the
presentation of commissions. It will be well worth
seeing from the standpoint of what we have here in
the artillery personnel and for a good match.
