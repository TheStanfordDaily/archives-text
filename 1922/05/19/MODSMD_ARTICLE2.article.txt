# INVADING CARDINAL TRACK SQUAD LEAVES FOR HARVARD
## Chances For Victory In East Impaired By Injury To Hanner 
### 
With four of the ten athletes hampered by injuries of one kind or another,
Stanford's invading cinder path squad left Oakland at 11 :30 this morning,
bound for Cambridge to compete for the third time in the I. C. A. A. A. A. na
tional championships.
The jinx which has been pursuing Templeton and his men for the past two
months overtook them again this morning when it became known that Flint
Hammer had suffered an injury to his back which will seriously handicap him
at Harvard. The Cardinal captain had been expected to win first cfr second in

the javelin, but the combination of a sore
arm and injured back has cut his mark
in the event down to 185 feet.
Hartranft, Templeton hopes, will be
in first-class shape by next Friday, when
the preliminaries will be run off at the
Harvard Stadium. At the time of the
injury to his leg, the doctors declared
that the weight marvel would be en
tirely well in two weeks.
Templeton's other "cripples," Kirksey
and Minsky, are in less favorable posi
tions. The veteran sprinter's leg has
not been too strong at any time, the
tendon which he pulled ten days ago
has put him out of the running for the
100-yard, his best event. Minsky is
bothered by weak ankles.
The six other members of the Car
dinal delegation, however, are in the
best shape they have been all season.
Sudden returned last night from four
days at Pasadena with Paddock, and de
clares he is at the top of his form.
Falk, who was bothered by a weak leg
in the California meet, is in perfect con
dition.
A long list of misfortunes, which cul
minated in the injuries to Hartranft,
Kirksey, and Hanner, have transformed
Stanford from one of the favorites for
national honors to a mere "contender."
Before Howell's sickness, the majority
of sporting writers in the country had
conceded Templeton's squad at least
thirty points.
Now, however, Cardinal chances are
considerably poorer, and the stock of
the Blue and Gold has taken a jump.
Even with the condition of the four
men, the Stanford aggregation is doped
to take at least twenty-five points,
which may come close to winning the
meet. Cornell appears to be the "class'
of the eastern teams, as none of the
"Big Three"—Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton —has any strong representa
tion on the track.
The squad of ten men which left to
day is the largest that has been sent to
the I. C. A. A. A. A. since Stanford's
entry in 1920. Kirksey, Wells, and
Templeton scored eighteen points for
sixth place in 1920. A four-man team
composed of Kirksey, Wells, Williams,
and Falk made fifteen last year, taking
fifth place.

Hartranft, Templeton hopes, will be
in first-class shape by next Friday, when
the preliminaries will be run off at the
Harvard Stadium. At the time of the
injury to his leg, the doctors declared
that the weight marvel would be en
tirely well in two weeks.
Templeton's other "cripples," Kirksey
and Minsky, are in less favorable posi
tions. The veteran sprinter's leg has
not been too strong at any time, the
tendon which he pulled ten days ago
has put him out of the running for the
100-yard, his best event. Minsky is
bothered by weak ankles.
The six other members of the Car
dinal delegation, however, are in the
best shape they have been all season.
Sudden returned last night from four
days at Pasadena with Paddock, and de
clares he is at the top of his form.
Falk, who was bothered by a weak leg
in the California meet, is in perfect con
dition.
A long list of misfortunes, which cul
minated in the injuries to Hartranft,
Kirksey, and Hanner, have transformed
Stanford from one of the favorites for
national honors to a mere "contender."
Before Howell's sickness, the majority
of sporting writers in the country had
conceded Templeton's squad at least
thirty points.
Now, however, Cardinal chances are
considerably poorer, and the stock of
the Blue and Gold has taken a jump.
Even with the condition of the four
men, the Stanford aggregation is doped
to take at least twenty-five points,
which may come close to winning the
meet. Cornell appears to be the "class'
of the eastern teams, as none of the
"Big Three"—Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton —has any strong representa
tion on the track.
The squad of ten men which left to
day is the largest that has been sent to
the I. C. A. A. A. A. since Stanford's
entry in 1920. Kirksey, Wells, and
Templeton scored eighteen points for
sixth place in 1920. A four-man team
composed of Kirksey, Wells, Williams,
and Falk made fifteen last year, taking
fifth place.
With four of the ten athletes hampered by injuries of one kind or another,
Stanford's invading cinder path squad left Oakland at 11 :30 this morning,
bound for Cambridge to compete for the third time in the I. C. A. A. A. A. na
tional championships.
The jinx which has been pursuing Templeton and his men for the past two
months overtook them again this morning when it became known that Flint
Hammer had suffered an injury to his back which will seriously handicap him
at Harvard. The Cardinal captain had been expected to win first cfr second in

the javelin, but the combination of a sore
arm and injured back has cut his mark
in the event down to 185 feet.
