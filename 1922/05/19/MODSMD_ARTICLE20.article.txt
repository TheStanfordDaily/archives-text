# ABOUT NOMINATIONS
## 
### 
Nominations for the Student Body election will
be May 31. This is only two weeks away and does
not give too much time to think over the candidates
for the many offices which will be vacant in June.
This is the biggest election of the year and should be
of vital interest to every student in the University.
In the past there has not been the interest that there
should be. One or two of the most prominent offices
arc hotly contested and the rest go on a white ballot.
In most cases this is all wrong, because it stands to
reason that out of an active voting body of some

fifteen hundred or more there should be more than
two candidates for each office.
The elections this year will be in the week follow
ing the nominations, June 7. This is the date set by
the constitution of the Associated Students and is
only two days before the last class meetings of the
year. All work must be done soon, so it is impera
tive that all nominations be brought over at once,
so that a good share of men who are capable of
handling the job may be put up for election at the
polls on June 7.
