# BRINGING UP A SPORT
## 
### 
In the last month or so the debaters of Stanford
have brought home a string of victories that point
to but one thing. That is that capable men are
going into debating and that they are working hard
under a good coach. For a time debating has
languished here and interest has dragged in the
sport. The revival is good to see and is appreciated
by the big part of the student body that is interested
in debating, although not actively participating.
The taking of the JofYre Debate and the Public
Speaking Contest arc two of the recent victories.
We hope that to these may be added others soon and
that more men may come out for the sport, for such
it is, and strengthen the teams which are already
formed for the debates.
