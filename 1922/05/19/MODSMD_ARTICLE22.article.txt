There is a deal of logic in naming a boy "Sam John
son Pro Tern Brown." It always gives him a chance
to change his name without anyone saying they aren't
warned.
* • *
If we could All this arid space below,
Without a single culling from an ad,
Sans household hints, or flap of midnight moth,
And lacking jokes on streetcars, or of girls,
Without a line that deals with Union ways,
Ar all devoid of Operas and plays,
If we could do this thing, I'm here to say,-
We'd write our way to fame, and make it pay.

High Lights of a Corrector's Career
(By Abie Mazda))
You may think that it is a cinch to be a corrector;
well, so do I.
It is a cinch to be a public corrector, but fortunately
I began life as a private one. That is much the safest
way. It is something embarrassing to hear the remarks
of the students, but it is better. And then when tak
ing and correcting a course at the same time it is
easy to dray an A. 1 almost always do.
It is something terrible the way the men bury their
thoughts in a tangle of words. For instance, one of
them said about Mohammet, "Mohammet was fond of
animals and children!" This was one of my best days
as a corrector. I laughed at this for weeks. I gave
the guy a D. Ha, ha, ha.
I would advise all correctors to purchase a colored
pencil early in their career. It is such fun to dash
through books and papers, putting a red mark here,
a blue dash or question here, and ending up in a pert
remark that is sure to make a knockout with the
student. The less it has to do with the paper, the
better its effect. But be sure the comment is sprightly.
Merely sensible corrections that the student would ap
preciate are sure to make you popular. . . and then you
could never, never, be a corrector.

remark that is sure to make a knockout with the
student. The less it has to do with the paper, the
better its effect. But be sure the comment is sprightly.
Merely sensible corrections that the student would ap
preciate are sure to make you popular. . . and then you
could never, never, be a corrector.

There is a deal of logic in naming a boy "Sam John
son Pro Tern Brown." It always gives him a chance
to change his name without anyone saying they aren't
warned.

If we could All this arid space below,
Without a single culling from an ad,
Sans household hints, or flap of midnight moth,
And lacking jokes on streetcars, or of girls,
Without a line that deals with Union ways,
Ar all devoid of Operas and plays,
If we could do this thing, I'm here to say,-
We'd write our way to fame, and make it pay.

High Lights of a Corrector's Career
(By Abie Mazda))
You may think that it is a cinch to be a corrector;
well, so do I.
It is a cinch to be a public corrector, but fortunately
I began life as a private one. That is much the safest
way. It is something embarrassing to hear the remarks
of the students, but it is better. And then when tak
ing and correcting a course at the same time it is
easy to dray an A. 1 almost always do.
It is something terrible the way the men bury their
thoughts in a tangle of words. For instance, one of
them said about Mohammet, "Mohammet was fond of
animals and children!" This was one of my best days
as a corrector. I laughed at this for weeks. I gave
the guy a D. Ha, ha, ha.
I would advise all correctors to purchase a colored
pencil early in their career. It is such fun to dash
through books and papers, putting a red mark here,
a blue dash or question here, and ending up in a pert
remark that is sure to make a knockout with the
student. The less it has to do with the paper, the
better its effect. But be sure the comment is sprightly.
Merely sensible corrections that the student would ap
preciate are sure to make you popular. . . and then you
could never, never, be a corrector.
