# DISPLAY OF PHOTOS IS NOW BEING SHOWN BY DR. CARL WILSON
## 
### 
The display of artistic photographs by
Dr. Car! Wilson, which is now being
shown in the Stanford Art Gallery, is
proof of what results can be gotten with
a twenty-five-dollar camera.
Dr. Wilson is a Palo Alto surgeon
and has taken up photography as a
hobby. Although he uses no ray filter
in finishing the work, he has achieved
some very pleasing silhouette effects by
under exposure. Dr. Wilson always
works for a good sky or cloud back
ground, omitting any details in the
foreground, and the result is some un
usual examples of lighting and cloud
effect. Many of the photographs from
a standpoint of composition would make
excellent paintings.
Redro J. Lemos believes the exhibit to
be the best example of amateur photog
raphy ever shown in the Art Gallery.
