# NOTICE!

### 
Due to a typographical error, there
recently appeared in our columns a
statement to the effect that the Re
tread Shop, 516 High St., Palo Alto,
was about to go out of business.
To the contrary, the Retread Shop is
far from being out of business. A
special tire sale is taking place there
now, and many people are taking ad
vantage of the extremely good prices
to be had there, on standard makes of
tires.
