# GARDNER WOOD TALKS TO EUPHRONIANS ON WATER POWER BILL
## 
### 
"California, at the present time, has
the greatest power system of any place
in the world," declared Gardner P.
Wood, president of the Young Men's
Republican League, in a speech before
Euphronia last night. In opposing the
proposed Water and Power Act, Wood
pointed out that the reduction of pri
vate power company rates in California
during the past few years has been
greater than the reduction of rates un
oer municipal ownership, and that any
change from the present system of
power control would be for the worst.
"California," according to the speaker,
"has cheaper power rates than any state
in the Union."
Wood contended that the Water and
Power Commission, provided for by the
proposed act, is vested with too much
authority and that it would soon be
come an organization for the furtherance
of political graft. He stated that the
$500,000,000 over which the Commission
has control would, in all probability, be
squandered for purposes other than
power development. Thus the Commis
sion could first lower rates until the
private companies were put out of busi
ness and then boost the power charges
far above normal.
Following the speech an open discus
sion of the question was held.
