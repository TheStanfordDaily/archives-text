# PLANS OUTLINED FOR INTRAMURAL TRACK CONTEST NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Plans for the intramural track meet
to be held three days next week were
completed at a meeting of representa
tives of the campus organizations at the
gymnasium yesterday afternoon. A1
Masters, '23, who has been selected by
Mr. Botsford to take charge of the
meet, presided at the meeting. The
plans as drawn up do not differ very
greatly from last year's program. The
880-yard dash has been substituted for
the mile, and the 12-pound shot will be
used this year instead of the 16-pound.
Representatives from twenty-five organ
izations were present at the meeting.
The meet will start Monday afternoon,
Maj' 22, when the 100-yard dash and the
shot put will take place. The half-mile,
broad jump, and 120-yard low hurdles
will be run off on Tuesday, and the
contest will be completed Wednesday
with the big eight-man 220-yard relay.
Points will be figured on a percentage
basis. Each organization will count the
ten best marks made by their men in
all of the events.
All men who competed against Cal
ifornia this year are ineligible for .the
meet. However, men who have made
letters in former years and who did not
go out for varsity track this year, may
compete.
