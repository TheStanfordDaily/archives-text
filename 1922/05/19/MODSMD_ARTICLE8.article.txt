# PREHISTORIC SKULL DISCOVERED NEAR CONVALESCENT HOME
## Believed by Bailey Willis to Be Contemporary of the Earliest Man 
### 
Older than the oldest alumnus who
will be on the campus tomorrow is the
man whose skull has just been found
on the campus. He was very likely a
contemporary of Adam. His skull was
dug out of the bank of San Francisquito
creek by Bruce Seymour, '24, near the
Convalescent Home, at a point where it
had lain eighteen feet below the level
of the surrounding plain for a period
which -Dr. Bailey Willis, professor of
geotogy at Stanford, thinks must have
been at leAst 2,000 years and may have
been 10,000. So, says Dr. Willis, this
"Stanford" man may have been a con
temporary of Christ, or may easily have
been a contemporary of Adam.
Dr. Willis bases his estimate on the
geological history of the ground in
which tlje skull was found embedded.
The skull, which is perfectly preserved,
lay in cemented gravel which once
formed the channel of the creek cen
turies ago. That old bed was after
wards filled up and still later cut across
by the present channel of the stream.
The time involved since the skull wa«
washed in along with the gravel in
which it was embedded includes, then,
the periods required to fill in the old
channel, the interval during which the
plain extended over the old filled chan
nel, and the recent period during which
the new channel has been cut. This last_
has been brief, probably only a century
or so; the gravel, bearing the skull
along with it, was washed in quickly,
but bedded down slowly. It required
centuries upon centuries for it to be
come cemented and undergo the changes
which are evident upon study—certainly
not less than the stretch of the Chris
tian era, and alsogether reach
ing back to Adam.
There seems to Dr. Willis to be no
