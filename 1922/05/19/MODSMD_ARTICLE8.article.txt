# PREHISTORIC SKULL DISCOVERED NEAR CONVALESCENT HOME
## Believed by Bailey Willis to Be Contemporary of the Earliest Man 
### 
Older than the oldest alumnus who
will be on the campus tomorrow is the
man whose skull has just been found
on the campus. He was very likely a
contemporary of Adam. His skull was
dug out of the bank of San Francisquito
creek by Bruce Seymour, '24, near the
Convalescent Home, at a point where it
had lain eighteen feet below the level
of the surrounding plain for a period
which -Dr. Bailey Willis, professor of
geotogy at Stanford, thinks must have
been at leAst 2,000 years and may have
been 10,000. So, says Dr. Willis, this
"Stanford" man may have been a con
temporary of Christ, or may easily have
been a contemporary of Adam.
Dr. Willis bases his estimate on the
geological history of the ground in
which tlje skull was found embedded.
The skull, which is perfectly preserved,
lay in cemented gravel which once
formed the channel of the creek cen
turies ago. That old bed was after
wards filled up and still later cut across
by the present channel of the stream.
The time involved since the skull wa«
washed in along with the gravel in
which it was embedded includes, then,
the periods required to fill in the old
channel, the interval during which the
plain extended over the old filled chan
nel, and the recent period during which
the new channel has been cut. This last_
has been brief, probably only a century
or so; the gravel, bearing the skull
along with it, was washed in quickly,
but bedded down slowly. It required
centuries upon centuries for it to be
come cemented and undergo the changes
which are evident upon study—certainly
not less than the stretch of the Chris
tian era, and alsogether reach
ing back to Adam.
There seems to Dr. Willis to be no
other hypothesis for explaining" the pres
ence of the skull where it was found
except that given. At first he thought
the skull was that of an Indian or early
Spaniard, part of a body buried by the
missionaries, but investigation showed
that the pebbles lying above the skull
have never been disturbed since the
water lay them down. No grave was
dug. The theory that the skull had been
washed up into its place by some recent
flood was disproved by the fact that the
skull was cemented in with the sur
rounding gravel and that it is filled on
the inside with exactly the same mate
rials, showing the same geological pro
cesses as that surrounding it. I)r. Wil
lis' conclusion, therefore, is that it must
have come in with the pebbles in which
it was found.
The skull was partly projecting from
the cliff which the creek has worn down
by its channel at this point. Dr. Willis
intends to send it to the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, which has
the largest collection of skulls in this
country, in order that its age may be
more scientifically determined.
The skull is that of a man with pow
erful neck and shoulder muscles, as is
proved by the deep "muscle scars" on
the back of the cranium. The bony
ridges immediately above the eyes are
strongly developed in a manner char
acteristic of primitive many. The skull
has many resemblances to the Neander
thal man, who lived in central Europe
25,000 or so years ago, used stone im
plements and had a considerabl degree
of culture.
The "Stanford man's" head is of the
"long" type, as are those of the Anglo-
Saxons, all the northern races of
Europe and many of the American In
dians. He was probably a descendant
of emigrants from Asia who came into
America at a time when there was
probably land connection with Alaska
and then south, and developed into the
many tribes of North American Indians.

washed up into its place by some recent
flood was disproved by the fact that the
skull was cemented in with the sur
rounding gravel and that it is filled on
the inside with exactly the same mate
rials, showing the same geological pro
cesses as that surrounding it. I)r. Wil
lis' conclusion, therefore, is that it must
have come in with the pebbles in which
it was found.
The skull was partly projecting from
the cliff which the creek has worn down
by its channel at this point. Dr. Willis
intends to send it to the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, which has
the largest collection of skulls in this
country, in order that its age may be
more scientifically determined.
The skull is that of a man with pow
erful neck and shoulder muscles, as is
proved by the deep "muscle scars" on
the back of the cranium. The bony
ridges immediately above the eyes are
strongly developed in a manner char
acteristic of primitive many. The skull
has many resemblances to the Neander
thal man, who lived in central Europe
25,000 or so years ago, used stone im
plements and had a considerabl degree
of culture.
The "Stanford man's" head is of the
"long" type, as are those of the Anglo-
Saxons, all the northern races of
Europe and many of the American In
dians. He was probably a descendant
of emigrants from Asia who came into
America at a time when there was
probably land connection with Alaska
and then south, and developed into the
many tribes of North American Indians.
Older than the oldest alumnus who
will be on the campus tomorrow is the
man whose skull has just been found
on the campus. He was very likely a
contemporary of Adam. His skull was
dug out of the bank of San Francisquito
creek by Bruce Seymour, '24, near the
Convalescent Home, at a point where it
had lain eighteen feet below the level
of the surrounding plain for a period
which -Dr. Bailey Willis, professor of
geotogy at Stanford, thinks must have
been at leAst 2,000 years and may have
been 10,000. So, says Dr. Willis, this
"Stanford" man may have been a con
temporary of Christ, or may easily have
been a contemporary of Adam.
Dr. Willis bases his estimate on the
geological history of the ground in
which tlje skull was found embedded.
The skull, which is perfectly preserved,
lay in cemented gravel which once
formed the channel of the creek cen
turies ago. That old bed was after
wards filled up and still later cut across
by the present channel of the stream.
The time involved since the skull wa«
washed in along with the gravel in
which it was embedded includes, then,
the periods required to fill in the old
channel, the interval during which the
plain extended over the old filled chan
nel, and the recent period during which
the new channel has been cut. This last_
has been brief, probably only a century
or so; the gravel, bearing the skull
along with it, was washed in quickly,
but bedded down slowly. It required
centuries upon centuries for it to be
come cemented and undergo the changes
which are evident upon study—certainly
not less than the stretch of the Chris
tian era, and alsogether reach
ing back to Adam.
There seems to Dr. Willis to be no
other hypothesis for explaining" the pres
ence of the skull where it was found
except that given. At first he thought
the skull was that of an Indian or early
Spaniard, part of a body buried by the
missionaries, but investigation showed
that the pebbles lying above the skull
have never been disturbed since the
water lay them down. No grave was
dug. The theory that the skull had been
washed up into its place by some recent
flood was disproved by the fact that the
skull was cemented in with the sur
rounding gravel and that it is filled on
the inside with exactly the same mate
rials, showing the same geological pro
