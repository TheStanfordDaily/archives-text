before you can play this horn
Ordinarily a diploma doesn't turn into a horn of
plenty overnight. This truism sums up a good deal
of the advice you seniors may expect to hear.
People who know best don't want you to be im
patient. They say you can't expect to run things
from the start. Are they right?
To answer that question, look back to the time
when you were freshmen. How many in your class
j >t won any worthwhile campus honors that year?
And why should they? What kind of a varsity
team would freshmen make?
Well, that's the way many people feel about
seniors hoping to run the business world next year.
The ambition to lead is all right. But —in business
as at college —first must come the try-outs. Then,
if you plug hard, the scrub team. Then, when you
tshow you've "got the stuff," the varsity.
But through it all remember this: the harder you
work on the scrub, the sooner you'll make the
j,i 1 ' ,1, J ...
varsity and the better you 11 cover your position.
Work hard. Keep fit. Don t get downhearted.
Remember, the team will need new blood some
day—maybe next game. When your chance comes, ,
be ready.
