# WILSON'S WILL GIVE SOPHOMORE CLASS PART OF PROCEEDS
## 
### 
Does the place where you eat put out
poor meals on Tuesday? Have you a
special dish that you want? Is that
woman forgetting you?
If so, and if not, Wilson's in Palo Alto
or on the campus will take care of all
these little things for you tomorrow.
The chef has prepared an extra special
dinner in the evening for that hungry
feeling, and he has promised to put out
a lunch that will take care of you in a
highly satisfactory manner.
And about that special dish. The
manager is whispering that special dishes
will be much in evidence at the Palo Alto
food and drink shop tomorrow.
If that woman is forgetting you, send
her one of Wilson's boxes of sugared re
membrances; only get it tomorrow.
All the trade that flows into Wilson's
tomorrow above a certain amount will be
turned over by Sticky to the Sophomore
Class to be used in helping to raise the
class debt. Come early and avoid the
rush.
