# PAUL DAVIS, 19, FLIES IN AEROPLANE CIRCUS
## 
### 
Lieutenant Paul H. Davis, '19, now
attending the University, was the
latest acquisition to the list of celeb
rities who appeared at the aerial circus
staged in San Mateo yesterday under
the auspices of the Three Cities Cham
ber of Commerce.
Lieutenant Davis came into promi
nence in 1919 when a border patrol
which he was piloting made a forced
landing in Mexico at the time when
relations between the United States;
and Mexico were in a very unsettled i
condition. Davis and his companion.
Lieutenant W. 11. Peterson, were cap- j
tured by bandits, who demanded that'
the United States Government pay a i
ransom of .$15,000 for their release.
Feariiff that the government would ,
delay too long in sending the money i
demanded, the citizens of Marfa,
Texas, where the aviators were sta
tioned, raised the amount by popular
subscription. The $15,000 was for
warded to the Mexican bandits who
released Davis and Peterson, but not j
before they had been subjected to j
torture.
