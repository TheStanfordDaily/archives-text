# MANY IMPROVEMENTS ON CAMPUS RESULT OF GARDENERS' WORK
## 
### 
Within one week University garden
ers have transformed the courtyard
enclosed by the three Union build
igs into a formal garden with lawns,
gravel walks, flower gardens, shrubs
and trees. It is the intention to place
a fountain in the plot in the center
of the court as soon as the necessary
funds are donated. Between the ar
cades and the street sidewalk flower
ing plans will be set which will pre
sent a mass of color.
The delay in the moving of the
Stanford Inn has not been the fault
of the University authorities, since
the professional moving company
which has the job has been occupied
with work in Palo Alto.
Improvements have been made in
several triangular spaces formed
where side streets enter Lasuen. In
order to do away with the trouble
of re-planting flowers in these patches,
several times a year, shrubs have been
set in, which will give a solid green
appearance all the year around and
will necessitate very little attention.
Eight fir trees and one oak were trans
ported from the arboretum last week
and planted around the 'basketball
pavilion. The driveways which have
been graded will be given a surface of
oil and crushed gravel. It is planned
to have the electric light standards
installed shortly. Near the arboretum
large beds of petunas have been put
in along the sides of the paved roads.
A large awning to cover the outer
court of the President's house has been
purchased as a permanent improve
ment.
