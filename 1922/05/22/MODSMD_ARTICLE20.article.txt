What Stanford and California, the
Far West's entries in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
track and field meet, do in the cham
pionships at Harvard Saturday after
noon will be relayed across the conti
nent and announced at a student body
dance at the pavilion that evening.
In addition to the complete results, a
telegram is expected from "Dink" Tem
pleton telling of the performances of his
men in their various events.
Proceeds from the dance will go to
complete the budget for sending the
Cardinal cinderpath squad to Harvard,
and will supplement the thousand dollars
raised for that purpose by the carnival.
The admission will be $1 a couple, with
music furnished by Grinstead's eight
piece orchestra.
Templeton and his ten trackmen, ac
companied by Manager Grothe, are com
pleting the first lap of their transconti
nental journey this evening. They are
due to arrive in Chicago at 9 o'clock to
morrow morning, and after a day in the
Windy City will start for Boston.
Eastern teams will cut more of a fig
ure in the affair Saturday than most of
the sport followers on the coast believe.
Cornell and Pennsylvania seem to have
the outstanding aggregations. At Ithaca
the veteran Andy Moakley has a well
balanced corps of point winners, led by
Lovejoy, with 9 4-5 to his credit in the
100.
Albert LeConey, the Lafayette star,
whom Kirksey defeated last year, was
timed in 9 7-10 seconds in the century in
a dual meet last Saturday.
Walt Christie and his fifteen Bears,
who are out to retain their title, arrived
in Ithaca and will train with the Cornell
squad before leaving for Boston
day.
