# THEY HAD A GOOD TIME

### 
When Jack McDowell sold all of the 060 tickets
to the alumni dinner before Saturday and many came
down the last minute and asked for reservations there
was no doubt left in his mind that the alumni had
accepted Stanford's invitation and come back en
masse to meet once more on the campus. Although
this was only the second of the real alumni days it
carried all the earmarks of one that had the prepara
tion of years behind it.
Expressions of amazement were heard from all
sides on the progress that has been made in the
building and beautification on the grounds in the
last month. One of the younger grads took a look
at the court in front of the Union and said, " I was
down here two weeks ago and this place looked like
a city dump, and now—well I'll be damned if I can
see how they transplant that grass and make it look
so natural." And so it was on all sides, exclama
tions regarding the beauty of the new Union lobby,
the basketball pavilion, the changes made in the
campus by the new system of planting that has been
put in the last two years. The old saying, "things
ain't like they used to be," was heard a good many
times, but with a different meaning than you usually
hear when someone is making his lament over the
Joss of the good old times that used to exist when he
or she was on the campus.
The General Committee, headed by Charlie Field,
with Alice Kimball and Jack McDowell in charge of
program and attendance, respectively, put over the
day in a manner that left absolutely nothing to be
desired except that there be just as fine a day next
year. A '14er, or rather a '14ess, said "You remem
ber when we were here how bored we were to have
to show some of the old crowd around occasionally
-on the campus; why, these students here now seem
to enjoy it." It was a pleasure and the Senior Class
took advantage of the chance to get acquainted with
-the alumni body of which it is soon to become a part.
The Uncle Johns made a great hit in the automo
biles. Many claimed that the "lines" peddled out
were far beyond the wildest flights of fancy of the
good old uncle.
The most remarkable piece of service on the pro
gram was the dinner served in the basketball pa
vilion. No better service could have been asked for
an a first class hotel, and the quiet, efficient way with
•which the supper was served and then cleared in the
hall with about seven hundred seated seems a marvel
and a material tribute to the competency of the com
mittee in charge. Everything was hot and tastefully
put before the diners, and everyone left with a feel
ing that he had been surprised by getting such a
supper in such a crowd when the best thing that lie
had expected was something after the fashion of the
basket social.
When the evening wound up with the dance many
steps were seen that have not been produced before
on the Stanford campus—for many years. Funny
incidents resulted several times on the floor when
introductions were made and Misses Jones were
Mrs. Smiths now. It looked good to see the men
and women dancing on the floor representing thirty
classes. After the evening was over and the old
gang had left we thought it over and decided it had
made us realize a whole lot clcarer why it is that it

taxes the vests of the old-timers when they look vou
over and say, "Me? I'm a Stanford man."

gram was the dinner served in the basketball pa
vilion. No better service could have been asked for
an a first class hotel, and the quiet, efficient way with
•which the supper was served and then cleared in the
hall with about seven hundred seated seems a marvel
and a material tribute to the competency of the com
mittee in charge. Everything was hot and tastefully
put before the diners, and everyone left with a feel
ing that he had been surprised by getting such a
supper in such a crowd when the best thing that lie
had expected was something after the fashion of the
basket social.
When the evening wound up with the dance many
steps were seen that have not been produced before
on the Stanford campus—for many years. Funny
incidents resulted several times on the floor when
introductions were made and Misses Jones were
Mrs. Smiths now. It looked good to see the men
and women dancing on the floor representing thirty
classes. After the evening was over and the old
gang had left we thought it over and decided it had
made us realize a whole lot clcarer why it is that it

taxes the vests of the old-timers when they look vou
over and say, "Me? I'm a Stanford man."
When Jack McDowell sold all of the 060 tickets
to the alumni dinner before Saturday and many came
down the last minute and asked for reservations there
was no doubt left in his mind that the alumni had
accepted Stanford's invitation and come back en
masse to meet once more on the campus. Although
this was only the second of the real alumni days it
carried all the earmarks of one that had the prepara
tion of years behind it.
Expressions of amazement were heard from all
sides on the progress that has been made in the
building and beautification on the grounds in the
last month. One of the younger grads took a look
at the court in front of the Union and said, " I was
down here two weeks ago and this place looked like
a city dump, and now—well I'll be damned if I can
see how they transplant that grass and make it look
so natural." And so it was on all sides, exclama
tions regarding the beauty of the new Union lobby,
the basketball pavilion, the changes made in the
campus by the new system of planting that has been
put in the last two years. The old saying, "things
ain't like they used to be," was heard a good many
times, but with a different meaning than you usually
hear when someone is making his lament over the
Joss of the good old times that used to exist when he
or she was on the campus.
The General Committee, headed by Charlie Field,
with Alice Kimball and Jack McDowell in charge of
program and attendance, respectively, put over the
day in a manner that left absolutely nothing to be
desired except that there be just as fine a day next
year. A '14er, or rather a '14ess, said "You remem
ber when we were here how bored we were to have
to show some of the old crowd around occasionally
-on the campus; why, these students here now seem
to enjoy it." It was a pleasure and the Senior Class
took advantage of the chance to get acquainted with
-the alumni body of which it is soon to become a part.
The Uncle Johns made a great hit in the automo
biles. Many claimed that the "lines" peddled out
were far beyond the wildest flights of fancy of the
good old uncle.

gram was the dinner served in the basketball pa
