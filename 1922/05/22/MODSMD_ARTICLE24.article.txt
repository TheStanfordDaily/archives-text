# SCORE A KNOCKOUT

Some of us got a big kick out of the radiophone at
the alumni dinner. Especially was this so. perhaps,
in the case of those who had never heard speech by
way of the air before. Some of the wise ones will
say that they were 011 to the game before the "Arling
ton Station" opened up with its call for Stanford
University. Then when Herbert Hoover and Will
Irwin gave their talks with the personal references
and characteristic deliveries of each of them the
illusion was complete. The end line of the operator
as he closed the message from the sending station
was a bit flowery, that was the only thing that might
have picked the message from a real one.
But whatever may be said, about ninety-nine out
of each hundred there were fooled and fooled good,
so that they didn't ask any questions afterward about
the wireless. That is enough to prove that Harris
Ryan is more than a world figure in the electrical
line. He's quite some magician also.
