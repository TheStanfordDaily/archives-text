						TRAGIC CLIMAX

### 
When Jimmie Moore met his death Friday night
on Palm Drive there came the climax to a series of
accidents that have happened lately. These are
bringing us nearer and nearer to the place where we
will have to lose a right to drive upon the Stanford
campus. This is no matter of recklessness caused
by liquor because the late accidents have not been at
all traceable to that cause. We have no solution to
offer at present, but we are shocked, and sorrow
with a host of Moore's friends. As always, after
the deed is done, we wonder why it can't be seen
ahead of time the sorrow that accidents are going
to cause in some home.
