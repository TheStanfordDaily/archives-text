ADVERTISING FIT TO PRINT
Something's wrong. Everything's going to hock and
ruin. The hair-oil companies are liquidating. The banks
are having such a dull time they close at 3 o'clock every
afternoon. Even the tire-chain manufacturers are on
the skids. What's wrong? The answer, like all great
things, is simple—poor advertising!
Live advertising means everything, as Nero remarked
when he fired the fire department and then fired Rome.
Did you ever hear of Alexander the Great? If you did,
it's because he advertised himself. If you didn't it's
your own fault. And where would Aaron Burr have
• been if he hadn't advertised himself? (Safe at home,
probably, but that's beside the point).

In order to liven things up, there are printed below
a few samples of advertising as it should be, with a
few choice selections:

Sample One: Snappy, deceitful, yet within the law.
Appeals to your reader's cupidity, imganitation and
economy all at once. As a sales-pusher, this can't be
beat:

Why Appear Poor When You Don't Have To
(Even if you Are) ?
Deck yourself out like the Tower of Diamonds at a
nominal cost!
Our Trixim diamonds turn the trick! They glisten and
sparkle, they twinkle and shine, just like the real thing.
Our own diamond experts can not tell the difference.
Fool your friends, your family, your neighbors, the
police and yourself—even your fiancee. Give her a
Trixim Genuine (glass) Diamond Ring, and watch her
jump up and down. We have a standing offer of $10
wcrth of Trixim jewels for any agent of ours who can
show in public the difference between Trixim Man-Made
Sparklers, and nature's own. Present prices—50c for
10 carats, 10c for each additional carat thereafter.

Sample Two: The world wants something new —here
it is. Novel ideas, combined with flashy testimonials,
make an irresistible appeal. Glance over the following:

Have you a phonograph in your home. If not, don't
you want one? Don't your children ask God every night
for a phonograph? Doesn't.your wife pray for one at

friends. Read the following testimonials and see what
you're missing:
"I used to have nothing to do in my spare moments
but eat and sleep. Now, thanks to the start you gave
me, I don't sleep at all, and eat but rarely. Phonograph
building has fascinated me. I earned money at the rate
of 16j/£c every thirty seconds last night."—Hiram Korn
kob, Korn Korners, Kansas.
"The whole family has taken it up. Little Rosco,
aged 4, turns out three phonographs a day. We have
bought a Pierce-Arrow and mortgaged our home. Thanks
for the help.—John Smith, New York."
"At last I have found something to do in my spare
time. All that I have to occupv my working hours
with are my studies, track work, newspaper writing,
social affairs, and organization duties. The rest of
my time was a perfect waste, but since I have taken up
your scheme I have realized that I was wrong.— (signed)
