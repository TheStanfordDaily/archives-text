PEACE IN SOUTH IRELAND
Michael Collins, head of the Pro
visional Government of Ireland, and
Eamonn de Valera, leader of the Re
publican Party, have agreed to a truce.
As a result, arrangements are being
made for a general election of the
Dail to be held next month. The sole
issue to be voted on will be the Rati
fication of the Treaty with England.
The agreement between the chiefs
provides for the presentation of a coa
lition slate to the voters. This seems
to indicate that the insurgent group
is willing to give up the idea of com
plete independence if the Irish elector
ate so decrees.
LLOYD GEORGE RETURNS IN
TRIUMPH
The Cabinet and some three hundred
members of Parliament gave Lloyd
George an unprecedented welcome
when they met him at the Victoria
Station on his return from Genoa,
Saturday. Though the Conference can
not be acclaimed a great success the
people seem to realize the tremendous
odds against which their Premier had
to wqrk and are giving him credit for
his untiring efforts to effect some sort
of settlement. â€¢
RESIGNATION OF DAUGHERTY
ASKED

ocrat, is leading the bi-partisan attack
against Attorney General Daugherty,
and is demanding the latter's resig

erty with Charles W. Marse, financier
and shipbuilder, the purport of it be
ing a promise by the latter to Daugh
erty and Felder, an Atlanta attorney,
of a $25,000 fee, contingent upon the
securing of pardon or commutation
for Morse, who was at the time (1911)
held in the Atlanta penitentiary. The
Attorney General has made no answer
to the charge but Senator Watson of
Indiana, has stated in his behalf that
he has no connection with the Morse
case.
