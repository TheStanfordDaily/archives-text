Editor, Daily Palo Alto: â€”Per-
mit me to express my hearty
thanks to those of the Student
Body who co-operated so loyally
and efficiently with our effort to
make the second University Day
such a success as to establish it
among Stanford customs. Their
reward lies in the consciousness
that they have joined in making
a Stanford tradition, for, as Dr.
Jordan said to us pioneers thirty
years ago, "The highest value of
tradition lies in the making of
it."
Sincerely,
CHARLES K. FIELD.
