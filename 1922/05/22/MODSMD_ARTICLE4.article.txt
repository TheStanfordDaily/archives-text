A deep, dark, dank, dismal dungeon is
predicted by attorneys of the prosecu
tion as the fate which awaits a certain
wayward member of Nestoria Debating
Society, who is accused of high treason,
mutiny and desertion.
Perhaps you have seen several lynx
eyed detectives slinking about the campus
during the past few days. No, they are
not looking for violators of the Honor
System, but are merely gathering evi
dence to be used in the trial of the ac
cused man.
Unless the defendant escapes, in spite
of the careful watch that is being kept
on his every movement, his trial will be
held next Wednesday evening in Room
12 of the Law Building. Court spectators
are invited.
