# FORMER CURATOR OF STANFORD MUSEUM CONDUCTS SURVEY
## 
### 
Harry C. Peterson, former curator of
the Stanford Museum, is directing a sur
vey of early California landmarks as a
preliminary to the "Days of '49" celebra
tion in Sacramento. Among other mem
bers of the survey is Ernest J. Hopkins,
Stanford ex-'ll, a member of the San
Francisco Examiner staff of special
writers.
The chief object of the survey is the
marking of early-day landmarks con
nected with the gold mining period. The
party will visit Hornitos, Bear Valley,
the Mariposa mining region, the Big Oak
Flat country, Coulterville, Chinese Camp
and Tuttletown, where the old Mark
Twain cabin will be marked. At the
close of their ten-day circuit the mem
bers of the expedition will be met at old
Fort Sutter by the '49ers from Sacra
mento and will be escorted on a trium
phal march into Sacramento.
Peterson, in addition to being collec
tor of California for the State Library
at Sacramento, is an authority on early
day history and one of the leading spirits
in the planning of the "Days of '49"
celebration. He is credited with being
the originator of the "whiskerino" idea
and is the possessor of a well-grown
beard which created much interest on his
flying visit to Palo Alto Thursday.
