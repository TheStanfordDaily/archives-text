New facilities are provided by the Palo

opened an artistic tea room with the
added attraction of a southern cook.
The tea room, which opened last week
in response to a long felt want, is pre

Luncheons range in price from 35 cents
to 50 cents and may be obtained between
12 and 1:30 o'clock. Tea is served from
3 to 5 o'clock for 25 cents.
