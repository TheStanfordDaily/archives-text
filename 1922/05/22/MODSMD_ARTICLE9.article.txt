# OLD TIMERS ARE ENTERTAINED AT SECOND ANNUAL REUNION
## "Procession Of The Years" Brings Out Rivalry Of Classes; Lone Alumnus Cheers Class Of '92 
### 
"The old place isn't the same," wailed seven hundred graduates (by diploma
and request) who returned to the campus Saturday for the second annual Uni-'
versity Day. "No, it's better," came back from twenty-five hundred undergraduates.
And, from the sole representative of the class of 1892 down to the youngest alumnus
present, the old-timers agreed.
It was a great day on the Farm for Charlie Field, Jack McDowell, and their
cohorts who planned for the reunion. From the time of the Military Review in the
morning until the orchestra played "Home, Sweet Home" at midnight in the pa
vilion, there was not a dull moment.
Following the review of the Stanford Field Artillery Battalion and the presen
tation of commissions to reserve officers, an exhibition polo game was played at

10:30. The varsity and freshman swim
ming teams gave exhibitions of diving
and swimming in the Encina pool at
11 :30.
An official welcome was extended the
visitors by Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Dr. David Starr Jordan, and
members of the Board of Trustees at a
luncheon at the President's house at
12:30. Professor D. L. Webster of the
Physics department. Dr. Alonzo E. Tay
lor, executive head of the Stanford Food
Research Institute, and Professor Lewis
M. Terman of the Department of Edu
cation spoke to the alumni on Stanford's
part in larger branches of educational
work.
Everything moved smoothly until the
classes began to assemble in the inner
quad for the "Procession of the Years."
The embryo alumni of the class of '22
and most of the other classes gave their
yells and were content to let it go at
that. Far be it from '95 and-'96 under
the leadership of Charlie Field and Ray
Lyman Wilbur! When it came their
turn to be heard they claimed the center
of the stage until Thomas G. Crothers
of San Francisco, who alone bore the '92
banner, took exception to this insult and
demonstrated that even thirty years fails
to obliviate the memory of the "old class
yell." When the noise from the inter
class warfare subsided, the parade moved
through the inner quad past a Pathe
movie camera.
At 4 o'clock the alumni were guided
about by seniors to various departments
