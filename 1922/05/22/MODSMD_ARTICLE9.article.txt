# OLD TIMERS ARE ENTERTAINED AT SECOND ANNUAL REUNION
## "Procession Of The Years" Brings Out Rivalry Of Classes; Lone Alumnus Cheers Class Of '92 
### 
"The old place isn't the same," wailed seven hundred graduates (by diploma
and request) who returned to the campus Saturday for the second annual Uni-'
versity Day. "No, it's better," came back from twenty-five hundred undergraduates.
And, from the sole representative of the class of 1892 down to the youngest alumnus
present, the old-timers agreed.
It was a great day on the Farm for Charlie Field, Jack McDowell, and their
cohorts who planned for the reunion. From the time of the Military Review in the
morning until the orchestra played "Home, Sweet Home" at midnight in the pa
vilion, there was not a dull moment.
Following the review of the Stanford Field Artillery Battalion and the presen
tation of commissions to reserve officers, an exhibition polo game was played at

10:30. The varsity and freshman swim
ming teams gave exhibitions of diving
and swimming in the Encina pool at
11 :30.
An official welcome was extended the
visitors by Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Dr. David Starr Jordan, and
members of the Board of Trustees at a
luncheon at the President's house at
12:30. Professor D. L. Webster of the
Physics department. Dr. Alonzo E. Tay
lor, executive head of the Stanford Food
Research Institute, and Professor Lewis
M. Terman of the Department of Edu
cation spoke to the alumni on Stanford's
part in larger branches of educational
work.
Everything moved smoothly until the
classes began to assemble in the inner
quad for the "Procession of the Years."
The embryo alumni of the class of '22
and most of the other classes gave their
yells and were content to let it go at
that. Far be it from '95 and-'96 under
the leadership of Charlie Field and Ray
Lyman Wilbur! When it came their
turn to be heard they claimed the center
of the stage until Thomas G. Crothers
of San Francisco, who alone bore the '92
banner, took exception to this insult and
demonstrated that even thirty years fails
to obliviate the memory of the "old class
yell." When the noise from the inter
class warfare subsided, the parade moved
through the inner quad past a Pathe
movie camera.
At 4 o'clock the alumni were guided
about by seniors to various departments
where they were shown "how it is being
done nowadays." Machines were fur
nished to take the visitors on a half-hour
tour of the campus. At 5 o'clock an or
gan recital and glee club concert was
given in Memorial Church, and at 5:30
every living group on the campus was
thrown open to the visitors.
'"Hello, hello, hello, this is N. A. A.,
Arlington, Virginia, broadcasting station,
N. A. A. Hello, Stanford University!
Just a moment, please, until I connect
with Mr. Hoover in Washington, D. C.,
across the river, by land phone."
Charlie Field's promise had been ful
lilled, for thirty seconds later the mag
navox installed by Professor H. J. Ryan
transmitted Hoover's message to the
alumni seated about the dinner tables
and the seniors in the balcony. Mr.
Hoover's topic was "Troubles of the
Chief of the Ether Cops."
"I am very glad to send greetings to
the campus on University Day," came
in clear tones from the radio receiving
set. "I congratulate those who are so
fortunate that distance does not prevent
tlieir going back to Stanford for this en
joyable occasion." The "Chief of the
Ether Cops" described parts of his work
and told of some of the complaints which
reached his ears. In closing, he said,
"Tomorrow morning 10,000 letters will
start from the west to Washington pro
testing at the foolishness of colleges and
the consumption of precious time that
might be better applied to dissemination
of intellectual uplight. Go softly, broth
ers, you are not supposed to be human,
you are intellectual. Therefore, with
best wishes, I bid you all good night."
"Stanford men are not standardized
but individualistic," said Will Irwin, in
his long-distance message. Irwin de
scribed the famous "Stanford Spirit,"
and told how it had affected men whom
he had known.
Professor J. E. Coover conducted a
psychological experiment which resulted
in the appearance of two ghost-like fig
ures who admitted they were Herbert
Hoover and Will Irwin. When the
ghosts were unmasked, they were intro
duced as Will Irwin, '24. and Herbert
Hoover, '25.
During the dinner, Charlie Field, T. T.
C. Gregory, Dr. Starr Jordan, Professor
H. J. Ryan and President Wilbur spoke.
A portrait of Dr. Jordan, given to the
University, was displayed and the crowd
paid homage to the first president of
Stanford.
Two numbers from the Women's
Pageant and "Up On a Ladder" from the
Junior Opera were presented under the
direction of Les Seib and Gordon Davis.
"South Sea Follies" or "Crazy with Ta
hiti." written by Charlie Field and Dan
Evans and produced by Sam Menden
hall, was staged by a cast of fifteen.
As a conclusion to the day, the under
graduates joined in a dance from 11 to 12.

tation of commissions to reserve officers, an exhibition polo game was played at

10:30. The varsity and freshman swim
ming teams gave exhibitions of diving
and swimming in the Encina pool at
11 :30.
An official welcome was extended the
visitors by Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Dr. David Starr Jordan, and
members of the Board of Trustees at a
luncheon at the President's house at
12:30. Professor D. L. Webster of the
Physics department. Dr. Alonzo E. Tay
lor, executive head of the Stanford Food
Research Institute, and Professor Lewis
M. Terman of the Department of Edu
cation spoke to the alumni on Stanford's
part in larger branches of educational
work.
Everything moved smoothly until the
classes began to assemble in the inner
quad for the "Procession of the Years."
The embryo alumni of the class of '22
and most of the other classes gave their
yells and were content to let it go at
that. Far be it from '95 and-'96 under
the leadership of Charlie Field and Ray
Lyman Wilbur! When it came their
turn to be heard they claimed the center
of the stage until Thomas G. Crothers
of San Francisco, who alone bore the '92
banner, took exception to this insult and
demonstrated that even thirty years fails
to obliviate the memory of the "old class
yell." When the noise from the inter
class warfare subsided, the parade moved
through the inner quad past a Pathe
movie camera.
At 4 o'clock the alumni were guided
about by seniors to various departments
where they were shown "how it is being
done nowadays." Machines were fur
nished to take the visitors on a half-hour
tour of the campus. At 5 o'clock an or
gan recital and glee club concert was
given in Memorial Church, and at 5:30
every living group on the campus was
thrown open to the visitors.
'"Hello, hello, hello, this is N. A. A.,
Arlington, Virginia, broadcasting station,
N. A. A. Hello, Stanford University!
Just a moment, please, until I connect
with Mr. Hoover in Washington, D. C.,
across the river, by land phone."
Charlie Field's promise had been ful
lilled, for thirty seconds later the mag
navox installed by Professor H. J. Ryan
transmitted Hoover's message to the
alumni seated about the dinner tables
and the seniors in the balcony. Mr.
Hoover's topic was "Troubles of the
Chief of the Ether Cops."
"I am very glad to send greetings to
the campus on University Day," came
in clear tones from the radio receiving
set. "I congratulate those who are so
fortunate that distance does not prevent
tlieir going back to Stanford for this en
joyable occasion." The "Chief of the
Ether Cops" described parts of his work
and told of some of the complaints which
reached his ears. In closing, he said,
"Tomorrow morning 10,000 letters will
start from the west to Washington pro
testing at the foolishness of colleges and
the consumption of precious time that
might be better applied to dissemination
of intellectual uplight. Go softly, broth
ers, you are not supposed to be human,
you are intellectual. Therefore, with
best wishes, I bid you all good night."
"Stanford men are not standardized
but individualistic," said Will Irwin, in
his long-distance message. Irwin de
scribed the famous "Stanford Spirit,"
and told how it had affected men whom
he had known.
Professor J. E. Coover conducted a
psychological experiment which resulted
in the appearance of two ghost-like fig
ures who admitted they were Herbert
Hoover and Will Irwin. When the
ghosts were unmasked, they were intro
duced as Will Irwin, '24. and Herbert
Hoover, '25.
During the dinner, Charlie Field, T. T.
C. Gregory, Dr. Starr Jordan, Professor
H. J. Ryan and President Wilbur spoke.
A portrait of Dr. Jordan, given to the
University, was displayed and the crowd
paid homage to the first president of
Stanford.
Two numbers from the Women's
Pageant and "Up On a Ladder" from the
Junior Opera were presented under the
direction of Les Seib and Gordon Davis.
"South Sea Follies" or "Crazy with Ta
hiti." written by Charlie Field and Dan
Evans and produced by Sam Menden
hall, was staged by a cast of fifteen.
As a conclusion to the day, the under
graduates joined in a dance from 11 to 12.
"The old place isn't the same," wailed seven hundred graduates (by diploma
and request) who returned to the campus Saturday for the second annual Uni-'
versity Day. "No, it's better," came back from twenty-five hundred undergraduates.
And, from the sole representative of the class of 1892 down to the youngest alumnus
present, the old-timers agreed.
It was a great day on the Farm for Charlie Field, Jack McDowell, and their
cohorts who planned for the reunion. From the time of the Military Review in the
morning until the orchestra played "Home, Sweet Home" at midnight in the pa
vilion, there was not a dull moment.

quad for the "Procession of the Years."
The embryo alumni of the class of '22
and most of the other classes gave their
yells and were content to let it go at
that. Far be it from '95 and-'96 under
the leadership of Charlie Field and Ray
Lyman Wilbur! When it came their
turn to be heard they claimed the center
of the stage until Thomas G. Crothers
of San Francisco, who alone bore the '92
banner, took exception to this insult and
demonstrated that even thirty years fails
to obliviate the memory of the "old class
yell." When the noise from the inter
class warfare subsided, the parade moved
through the inner quad past a Pathe
movie camera.
At 4 o'clock the alumni were guided
about by seniors to various departments
where they were shown "how it is being
done nowadays." Machines were fur
nished to take the visitors on a half-hour
tour of the campus. At 5 o'clock an or
gan recital and glee club concert was
given in Memorial Church, and at 5:30
every living group on the campus was
thrown open to the visitors.
'"Hello, hello, hello, this is N. A. A.,
Arlington, Virginia, broadcasting station,
N. A. A. Hello, Stanford University!
Just a moment, please, until I connect
with Mr. Hoover in Washington, D. C.,
across the river, by land phone."
Charlie Field's promise had been ful
lilled, for thirty seconds later the mag
navox installed by Professor H. J. Ryan
transmitted Hoover's message to the
alumni seated about the dinner tables
and the seniors in the balcony. Mr.
Hoover's topic was "Troubles of the
Chief of the Ether Cops."
"I am very glad to send greetings to
the campus on University Day," came
in clear tones from the radio receiving
set. "I congratulate those who are so
fortunate that distance does not prevent
tlieir going back to Stanford for this en
joyable occasion." The "Chief of the
Ether Cops" described parts of his work
and told of some of the complaints which
reached his ears. In closing, he said,
"Tomorrow morning 10,000 letters will
start from the west to Washington pro
testing at the foolishness of colleges and
the consumption of precious time that
might be better applied to dissemination
of intellectual uplight. Go softly, broth
ers, you are not supposed to be human,
you are intellectual. Therefore, with
best wishes, I bid you all good night."
"Stanford men are not standardized
but individualistic," said Will Irwin, in
his long-distance message. Irwin de
scribed the famous "Stanford Spirit,"
and told how it had affected men whom
he had known.
Professor J. E. Coover conducted a
psychological experiment which resulted
in the appearance of two ghost-like fig
ures who admitted they were Herbert
Hoover and Will Irwin. When the
ghosts were unmasked, they were intro
duced as Will Irwin, '24. and Herbert
Hoover, '25.
During the dinner, Charlie Field, T. T.
C. Gregory, Dr. Starr Jordan, Professor
H. J. Ryan and President Wilbur spoke.
A portrait of Dr. Jordan, given to the
University, was displayed and the crowd
paid homage to the first president of
Stanford.
Two numbers from the Women's
Pageant and "Up On a Ladder" from the
Junior Opera were presented under the
direction of Les Seib and Gordon Davis.
"South Sea Follies" or "Crazy with Ta
hiti." written by Charlie Field and Dan
Evans and produced by Sam Menden
hall, was staged by a cast of fifteen.
As a conclusion to the day, the under
graduates joined in a dance from 11 to 12.
"The old place isn't the same," wailed seven hundred graduates (by diploma
and request) who returned to the campus Saturday for the second annual Uni-'
versity Day. "No, it's better," came back from twenty-five hundred undergraduates.
And, from the sole representative of the class of 1892 down to the youngest alumnus
present, the old-timers agreed.
It was a great day on the Farm for Charlie Field, Jack McDowell, and their
cohorts who planned for the reunion. From the time of the Military Review in the
morning until the orchestra played "Home, Sweet Home" at midnight in the pa
vilion, there was not a dull moment.
Following the review of the Stanford Field Artillery Battalion and the presen
tation of commissions to reserve officers, an exhibition polo game was played at

10:30. The varsity and freshman swim
ming teams gave exhibitions of diving
and swimming in the Encina pool at
11 :30.
An official welcome was extended the
visitors by Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Dr. David Starr Jordan, and
members of the Board of Trustees at a
luncheon at the President's house at
12:30. Professor D. L. Webster of the
Physics department. Dr. Alonzo E. Tay
lor, executive head of the Stanford Food
Research Institute, and Professor Lewis
M. Terman of the Department of Edu
cation spoke to the alumni on Stanford's
part in larger branches of educational
work.
