# ANNUAL SENIOR BALL WILL TAKE PLACE IN WOMEN'S CLUBHOUSE
## Limited Number of Tickets to Be Put on Sale Tomorrow; Committee to Meet Tonight 
### 
Tickets for the 1922 Senior Ball, to be
held in the Women's Clubhouse on June
16, will be placed on sale at the Book
store tomorrow. In order that the floor
of the clubhouse will not be overcrowded
for dancing, a limited number of tickets
will be sold. The basketball pavilion
was considered impractical on account of
the lack of kitchen facilities.
A meeting of the Senior Ball Commit
tee will be held at the Pi Beta Phi house
at 7 o'clock this evening.
The size of the clubhouse will permit
an elaborate plan of decorations, and
the committee, in charge of Carey Bail
ard, has started work on the decorative
scheme.
Miss Etta Handy, manager of the Stu
dents' Union, will make the arrange
ments for the dinner, which will be
served from the kitchens of the Union.
The plan of having the new chef of the
Union prepare the dinner courses was
considered more satisfactory than the
caterer service employed in the past.
It is intended to have the music fur
nished by one of the popular orchestras
from San Francisco, and definite ar
rangements should be completed this
week-end.
