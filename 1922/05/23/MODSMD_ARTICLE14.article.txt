# DAILY ADDRESS WILL REPLACE CLASSES IN Y.W.C.A. CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Two series of daily addresses will
take the place of the usual classes at
the student conference to be held at
Asilomar, August 1 to 11, according
to a notice from Miss Margaret Flenni
ken, student secretary of the national
Y. W. C. A. A reduction of $25,000
in the budget of the conference division
made this change necessary. The
registration fee has been raised from
$6 to $8 to help the conference be
self-supporting. Regarding the change,
Miss Flenniken says:
"We are busy remodeling programs
which will be like those of the English
student conferences —with students as
co-operatives. Then, as usual, there
will be forums, technical hours, and
special discussion groups based on the
daily addresses; these discussions will
be led by the speakers themselves
sometimes and at other times by the
students.
"There will be representatives at
the Asilomar conference of the various
student movements in other countries,
so that the discussions and study of
world fellowship will be made real.
We will secure the strongest Christian
leaders in America for the other seri
es of addresses which will be based
on the philosophy of the Christian
life."
The conference classes in previous
years have been one of the most popu
lar and profitable features of (he stu
dent conferences, and Miss Flenniken
hopes that the 1922 program will prove
equally helpful.
