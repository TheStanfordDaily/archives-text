# "Journal of Whistler" Is Received at Library
## 
### 
Of E. R. and J. Pennell's "The
Whistler Journal," an edition placed
on the new book shelf at the Library
for this week, the Boston "Transcript"
says, "The Journal reveals the real
Whistler, his views on art and artists,
his wit and seriousness. It is rich in
personal observances and contains
many sketches, either the work of the
artist or some connected with his
career."
After James Whistler consented to
let the Pennells write his biography,
Mrs. Pennell kept a journal of the
artist's life. She relates many stories
of Whistler's life in the studio and
accounts of the Whistler School.
Meta Taylor translated "Village
Tales from the Black Forest," from
the German original by Bcrtliold Auer
bach, a recent addition to the library.
The translator says that she has tried
to preserve the simplicity of style and
the coloring of national character.
Because little is known about Germany
around the region of the Black Forest,
Meta Taylor has given a sketch of the
state of the country to which these
stories relate with a brief account of
the political and social life of the in
habitants.
Some of the folk-tales contained in
this volume are "Ivo," "Ilansjorg and
His Pipe," and "The Village Law."
