# EDWARD HE WILL GIVE TALK TONIGHT IN LITTLE THEATRE
## History Professor to Tell of Life Existing in European Universities in Middle-Ages 
### 
Professor Edward M. Hulme of the
•History department, who will deliver ;i
lecture this evening in the Little Theater
on the subject of "Life in a Medieval
University," has given some interesting
sidelights upon the subject which he will
discuss.
"In the great transition from medieval
to modern life no small part was played
by the universities," says Professor
Hulme, "especially by the University of
Paris." In further depicting the condi
tions in the universities of the Middle
Ages, he continues: "The narrow streets
of the Latin quarter swarmed with stu
dents who were on the alert for some
fresh intellectual excitement, eager, in
quiring, full of animal spirits, many of
them only half-civilized, desiring fame
and defying fortune. Among them later
on was Francois Villon, the vagabond
poet, a glimpse of whom we caught in a
play recently given at Stanford.
"In the medieval centuries there had
been an aristocracy of birth, whose ideals
are to be found in the traditions of
chivalry. It was now gradually to be
replaced by the aristocracy of intellect.
Student was to supplant knight. Many
of these students became wanderers.
They sang their songs of a free life
everywhere they went; and they did not
hesitate to start trains of thought that
eventually led to the intellectual and
spiritual emancipation of the individual."
In this fashion the lecturer will de
scribe the life of the student in the uni
versities of the Middle Ages, bringing
out by contrast the conditions in modern
European institutions as he had oppor
tunity to study them during a recent trip
to the Continent.
Professor Hulme is a Stanford
alumnus, and has done graduate work at
Harvard, Columbia and the University
of Paris. He is a recognized authority
on the subject of Medieval History. In
speaking of his "Renaissance and Refor
mation," which appeared while he was
professor of History at the University
of Idaho, and which has been accepted
as a standard text by many universities
and colleges, the "Pall Mall Gazette, of
London, has this to say: "To those who
possess anything of the real humanist
enthusiasm must give great pleasure
to find such a work as this proceeding
from the pen of a professor in the Uni
versity of Idaho. Alike in its scholar
ship, its breadth of sympathy, its intel
lectual sincerity, and its synthetic power,
it would have done credit to the oldest
and most august seats of learning. The
author not only knows but feels the
greatness of his theme."

on the subject of "Life in a Medieval
University," has given some interesting
sidelights upon the subject which he will
discuss.
"In the great transition from medieval
to modern life no small part was played
by the universities," says Professor
Hulme, "especially by the University of
Paris." In further depicting the condi
tions in the universities of the Middle
Ages, he continues: "The narrow streets
of the Latin quarter swarmed with stu
dents who were on the alert for some
fresh intellectual excitement, eager, in
quiring, full of animal spirits, many of
them only half-civilized, desiring fame
and defying fortune. Among them later
on was Francois Villon, the vagabond
poet, a glimpse of whom we caught in a
play recently given at Stanford.
"In the medieval centuries there had
been an aristocracy of birth, whose ideals
are to be found in the traditions of
chivalry. It was now gradually to be
replaced by the aristocracy of intellect.
Student was to supplant knight. Many
of these students became wanderers.
They sang their songs of a free life
everywhere they went; and they did not
hesitate to start trains of thought that
eventually led to the intellectual and
spiritual emancipation of the individual."
In this fashion the lecturer will de
scribe the life of the student in the uni
versities of the Middle Ages, bringing
out by contrast the conditions in modern
European institutions as he had oppor
tunity to study them during a recent trip
to the Continent.
Professor Hulme is a Stanford
alumnus, and has done graduate work at
Harvard, Columbia and the University
of Paris. He is a recognized authority
on the subject of Medieval History. In
speaking of his "Renaissance and Refor
mation," which appeared while he was
professor of History at the University
of Idaho, and which has been accepted
as a standard text by many universities
and colleges, the "Pall Mall Gazette, of
London, has this to say: "To those who
possess anything of the real humanist
enthusiasm must give great pleasure
to find such a work as this proceeding
from the pen of a professor in the Uni
versity of Idaho. Alike in its scholar
ship, its breadth of sympathy, its intel
lectual sincerity, and its synthetic power,
it would have done credit to the oldest
and most august seats of learning. The
author not only knows but feels the
greatness of his theme."
