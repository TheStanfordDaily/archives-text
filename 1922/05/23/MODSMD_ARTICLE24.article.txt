# MORE ABOUT THE BLOCK "S"
## 
### 
Manager M. W. Grotlie left San Francisco last
•Friday with the ten men of Coach Dink Templeton's
track squad bound for Boston. It will be his purpose
to distribute funds to members of the team at various
times during the trip.
Of course there is some work connected with the
disbursements of funds, but nevertheless this little
jaunt across country is the one thing most any mem
ber of the student body would prefer to continued
studying, in view of which it is rather difficult to
absorb the argument that managers would have noth
ing to work for if not awarded a Block "S" with a
bar beneath it.
Since last commenting on the proposition of "S's"
for managers, several communications received by
the Daily were for and against the present system,
and notices from two managers themselves took
stands on different sides of the question, which shows
that one manager at least would be out for the job
even if no "S" award were granted.
One manager suggested those who did not favor
the "S" on non-athletic sweaters were trying to class
managers with debaters. The Daily would group
neither managers with debaters nor debaters with
managers. Advocates of the "S" for managers argue
from the precedent of some universities which give
blocks for managing. It was merely pointed out that
Stanford previously had never followed the policy of
universities which enlarge the sphere of the block
letter beyond athletics, and suggested that the "S"
may be awarded debaters as well as managers on this
precedent. If it is the new Stanford policy to begin
•enlarging on the "S" and give it in all forms of com
petition and competition managers, well and good;
but if that is not the policy, let us not extend the "S"
at all, but keep it to its traditional significance, that
of proficiency in athletic competition.
It has also been stated that the old Block "S" idea
was already infringed on by the award to yell leaders.
However, the yell leader does not get a Block "S".
His sweater is not recognized as an "S" sweater. His
award is that of a megaphone sweater, and the "S"
thereon is merely incidental to the megaphone, to
show what student body granted the megaphone.
There is not the least similarity between the yell
leader's sweater and that of the athlete's. If man
agers want a football on their sweater, or a fountain
pen, with a small "s" through it, we would see no
conflict with the traditional conception of the Block
"S".
All other posts in student activity are filled with
out award of an "S," all but managers. Debaters,
editors of campus publications, leaders in dramatic
activity, all go on without such awards. Sport man
agers have quite as much to gain through working
in their departments as campus editors have in theirs.
The sport manager doesnt get a two-dollar-a-day
salary for the last four and one-half months of four
years' work, but the editor doesn't get trips to Los
Angeles, Boston, or elsewhere with teams; nor does
he have the pleasure of associating and working with
athletes particularly, aiding in their progress, which
should be the best incentive to manager tryoutees.
If some award is proper for managers, why not an
appropriate medal award. This is the only award
ever granted editors, and it would be more fitting for
the type of work done by managers than sweaters.
We believe the merits of managership such that

worth-while men will be attracted, award or no award
as far as medals or sweaters go. Men did not stop
trying out for the Daily when the medal award was
dropped. However, an award is appropriate, and
none more appropriate than an especially designed
medal for managers, something that will be as signifi
cant in connection with their work as the Block "S"
has always been of athletic competition alone.
