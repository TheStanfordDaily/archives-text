SPRING!
Dra-La, dra-la, zweet Zbri'g id 'ere.
O'd Wi'der'z Liveluzz od 'iz beir.
Do odder raid id quide zo wed
Ad Zpri'g'z, de very bezd do ged.
I lub zo mudge de verda'd greeds,
De floweri'g blossobs of dnavq beads —
Dra-la, Dra-la, zweed Zpri'g id 'ere,
De be'd zeazod of a' de year.
—Carbonated Bivalve.

Prof.: —Is Filbert an earnest student?
Brother:—l should say so! Why, he never even cuts
a corner.
* * m
Ain't it funny
When you meet
A fellow
On the campus
And say "Hello"
And some keen dame
Right behind him
Smiles
And says "Hello."
Oh, boy!
* * •
The dance.
The wild, barbaric music.
The paper decorations that come down.
The girl who says it is "adorable."
The heavy-footed stevedore who mashes
your patent leathers.
The last dance, (close harmony)
The ride.
The back seat party.
The break-down (ten miles out).
TIIO mental dud who says it is a frame-up.
The ride home.
The hazy 8 o'clock.
And we call it life! —R.L.
* * •
Sweet Sixteen—Oh, you do serve crabs, don't you?
Sour Sixty-five (behind the counter) —Oh, yes; we
serve all patrons alike.
• * •
To read about a rich divorce
Does irritate my soul;
On getting rich refusing tips—
I think some brains aren't whole.
I hear of vulgar royalty
And in my sneers revel,
And laugh aloud at "Reverend" Bill
And all his cheers for Hell.
When prohibitionists agree
That something must be done
I yawn, and with an agent
'% Go out upon a bun.
i For all this trivalio
I do not give a rap
But daggers out! —a Radio!
Wipe that guy off the map!
—Pantagruel.
• • *-
Watch for it. Next week, Cabbages will throw light
onto the life of Cleopatra and the snakes she had hang
ing around; this is the biggest exposure since the bath
ing parade in L. A. The story is told by means of a play,
written by the author of "High Lights of a Corrector' 3
Career." It is titled, "A Skin You Love to Touch, or,
Save the Surface and You Save All."
• • m
Leave it to the surveyors. They can get a line on
everything.
» • •
"Your Move," remarked the landlady to the delinquent
tenant.
* * *
"The hotting man at the soda works is a happy man."
"Why."
"He has a perfectly corking time."
• • •
Tally—Jones is getting better than a three-ring circus.
Ho —Whaddaya mean?
Tally—Keeps three rings and a pin going all the time.
* * •
Palo Alto —San Francisco
Commuter —This tunnel costa million dollars to build.
Commutress —Waste of money as far as you're con
cerned, isn't it?
* * *
AND THE WORST WAS LAST.

Ain't it funny
When you meet
A fellow
On the campus
And say "Hello"
And some keen dame
Right behind him
Smiles
And says "Hello."
Oh, boy!

The dance.
The wild, barbaric music.
The paper decorations that come down.
The girl who says it is "adorable."
The heavy-footed stevedore who mashes
your patent leathers.
The last dance, (close harmony)
The ride.
The back seat party.
The break-down (ten miles out).
TIIO mental dud who says it is a frame-up.
The ride home.
The hazy 8 o'clock.
And we call it life! —R.L.

To read about a rich divorce
Does irritate my soul;
On getting rich refusing tips—
I think some brains aren't whole.
I hear of vulgar royalty
And in my sneers revel,
And laugh aloud at "Reverend" Bill
And all his cheers for Hell.
When prohibitionists agree
That something must be done
I yawn, and with an agent
'% Go out upon a bun.
i For all this trivalio
I do not give a rap
But daggers out! —a Radio!
Wipe that guy off the map!
