Russian Law on Status
.of Foreigners
The executive committee of the Rus
sian government passed a decree giving
foreigners the same rights as Russian
citizens if they have secured permission
to operate in Russia. They must adhere
to the soviet laws, and the government
has the liberty of nullifying any agree
ment which seems to the judges to be
harmful to the safety of the state. Equal
protection is to be offered foreigners
and citizens by the Russian courts, pro
viding that Russians receive like treat
ment in other countries.
The new law provides that while all
land is government property, people
working it will be given life tenure. They
are not allowed to buy or sell land, and
if they leave it and discontinue cultiva
tion, the land is to be taken from them.
Steamer Egypt Sinks
Last Saturday the steamer Egypt, sail
ing from England to India, was struck
by the French steamer Seine and sank in
twenty minutes.
It is reported that ninety-eight people
lost their lives. The Egypt was not in
motion at the time of the collision owing
to the density of the fog. Considerable
difficulty was experienced in lowering
life boats, most of which were capsized.
The steamer Cape Iracon hastened to the
spot and aided in the rescue. The acci
dent occurred off the Island of Wishant
on the French coast.
Bolivia Denied Access to
Treaty of Ancon Conference
Chile and Peru denied Bolivia's re
quest to join the treaty of Ancan Con
ference now taking place in Washington.
The purpose of conference is to settle
the long standing dispute between Peru
and Chile over the former Peruvian
provinces of Tacna and Arica, which
Chile took by conquest. Owing to the
fact that Bolivia once owned part of the
disputed coastal region its government
feels that it should be consulted in the
final settlement.
