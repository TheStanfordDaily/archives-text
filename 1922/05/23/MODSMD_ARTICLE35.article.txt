# PRESIDENT ANGELL OF YALE RECEIVES AID IN REFORMS
## 
### 
Wlien Doctor James Rowland Angell
took the presidency of Yale he was told
that he would find all kinds of traditions
to buck up against in the establishing of
the reforms that he wanted to put in in
the way of putting Yale on a basis of co
operation rather than that fo several
colleges that function in more or
less of a separate manner at the time.
Since he has been president he has found
that these tilings were not as strong as
lie had been led to believe and he has
had the hearty support of the men lie ex
pected to go against him, according to
rumor.
He had been told that Anson Stokes,
the secretary of Yale, who had been
passed up for president, would be one
of the ones who would put stumbling
blocks in his way. Since that time Stokes
has been offered the presidency of sev
eral other institutions but has turned
down the offers, preferring rather to re
main at Yale than go to one of the other
institution, even as its head. He has
gotten behind Angell and helped him in
his work of reorganization and in every
way possible has shown that he is in the
work for the benefit of Yale even if he
was deeply disappointed in not being
chosen for the position of president.
The separate position enjoyed by the
Sheffield Scientific School, thought to
be something of a barrier in the way of
merging the university into one body.
Russell Henry Chittenden, director of
the Sheffield school, did not buck the
interests of the university. Instead he
worked with the Angell administration
and out of the effort came the united
college with the one four-year curricu
lum. Before that time there had been
two courses of study, one in the col
lege that had taken four years to com
plete for an A.B. and the one in
could be taken in three years. After the
diploma was gotten there was not much
difference in the mind of the ordinary
person as long as the graduate was a
Yale man. It was to overcome this that
the one unified system was put in.
Now the freshman classes are one and
no difference can be made between the
man in the college and in Sheffield. Many
of the old things seem to he in the past
although not particularly at the expense
of any of the worth-while traditions.
Doctor Angell is enjoying hearty sup
port. Some say that it is only the way
of the new leader getting by with the
crowd for the time being and that he
will stop as soon* as lie has hurt some
one's feelings. But lie seems to be mak
ing satisfactory progress at present. How
it will work out in the future is a matter
of calculation but most of his faculty
agree that there is no reason why he
should not be successful with the support
of the two men that were supposed to be
so much against him.
