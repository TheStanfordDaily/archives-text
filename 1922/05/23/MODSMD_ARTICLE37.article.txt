# EL CUADRO DROPS INTRAMURAL GAME TO KAPPA SIGMA
## 
### 
Kappa Sigma's intramural nine took
a close and interesting game from El
Quadro yesterday, by a score of 6 to
5. El Cuadro took the lead in the
flr!s J frame, scoring twfl runs on two
singles una an error, and added |jf ,,
more in the second on & stolen
base and another sin^ e Kappa
Sigma's half o( t^ ie se cctwd t Shtpko,
the first 'rftAlrt V.'p, tripled to deep center,
but tht Yiext three men were easy owls
and. jie was unable to score.
The fourth inning won the game for
Kappa Sigma, all of its six scores
crossing the plate in that frame. Ship
ke and Farish singled, and two bases
on balls accounted for one run. Farish
scored on a passed ball, and Aid hit
safely two more tallies. Powell
sent a toot liner through second, scor
ing Aid, and a moment later came
home on an error. This ended the
Kappa Sigma scoring.
El Cuadro staged a rally in the last
inning which fell one short of tying
the score, and ended with the winning
run on the paths. A walk, a hit bats
man, a single, passed ball, and fielder's
choice sent two men across, but Ro
gers tightened up and oaused the last
man to ground out to Shipke. Robin
son and Seymour made up the El
Cuadro battery, with Powell, Rogers
and Farish for the winners.
All other games were defaulted.
Howard K. Vaughn, captain of the
Sigma Chi nine, is confined to his
home in Palo Alto with a broken leg.
He was hurt while making a home run
in a game last week. His loss will
seriously weaken the Sigma Chi chan
ces for the intramural pennant, which
were conceded to be bright.
This afternoon's games are Chi Psi
against Sigma Nu, El Capitan and
Theta Delta Chi, Alpha Kappa Lambda
with Zeta Psi, Phi Kappa Psi with Phi
Delta Theta, and Alpha Chi Sigma and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
