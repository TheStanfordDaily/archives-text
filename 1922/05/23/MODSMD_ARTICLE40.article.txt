OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, Corvallis. —How to go through
college on $15 a month, earning that
and other expenses, is being demon
stated by six young men in the "Mud
Flats" district of Corvallis.
Hugh Hinton, '23, of New York City,
and Edward Rector, '21, of Seattle,
Wash., hopped off the train in Cor
vallis with $1,000 and the ambition to
become college graduates. They still
have most of their money and all of
their ambition, besides being two
years nearer their goal.
The boys first bought a lot for $400
and erected a building that served as
quarters for the two men. Later they
became acquainted with four other
students who also had a desire to
earn their own way through college,
so two more shacks were added at a
cost of $250i. These are rented from
the owners.
"Batching" is the method used by
the young men in combating the high
cost of living. They all work in Cor
vallis and are entirely dependent upon
what they earn, receiving money from
no other source. Vinton and Rector
have bought a small truck and intend
to do general truck work in their
spare time.
