# LIFE IN UNIVERSITY OF MEDIEVAL TIMES DESCRIBED BY HULME
## Student Crimes Common; Playing the Gentleman Is Still Their "Major Sport"

The university is not a characteristic
medieval institution, declared Professor
Edward Hulme of the History depart
ment last night in the Little Theater,
speaking on "Life in a Medieval Uni
versity." The university did not de
velop until the latter part of the Middle
Ages, about the thirteenth century; and
this institution, according to the speaker,

the Middle Ages and inaugurating the
present era by substituting positive ideals
for the negative, inhibitory medieval at

Louis that the first university dormitory
was erected. With its erection, the
teachers found it possible to hold their
classes in rooms of this building instead
of as formerly holding them in their own
private dwellings, in the open squares,
and in graveyards, with the tombstones
as seats.
Rich students attending the university
would live in taverns and have the lux

slept wherever they could, in ash-barrels
or under the bridges that crossed the
Seine. Professor Hulme stated that
when lie visited Paris a few years ago he
found this still to be the practice with
many students.
The only language of the medieval
university was Latin. In and out of
classes, the students were compelled to
use this language exclusively. The uni
