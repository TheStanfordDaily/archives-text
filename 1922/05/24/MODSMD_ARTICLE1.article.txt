# LIFE IN UNIVERSITY OF MEDIEVAL TIMES DESCRIBED BY HULME
## Student Crimes Common; Playing the Gentleman Is Still Their "Major Sport" 
### 
The university is not a characteristic
medieval institution, declared Professor
Edward Hulme of the History depart
ment last night in the Little Theater,
speaking on "Life in a Medieval Uni
versity." The university did not de
velop until the latter part of the Middle
Ages, about the thirteenth century; and
this institution, according to the speaker,
proved a powerful factor in destroying
the Middle Ages and inaugurating the
present era by substituting positive ideals
for the negative, inhibitory medieval at
titude toward life.
Professor Hulme described as typical
the University of Paris, "the mother of
all modern universities." At the height
of its fame, it claimed over 10,000 stu
dents from all lands. For a long time,
in this as well as in all medieval uni
versities, there were not any buildings,
lecture halls, campus, library, or labora
tory. It was not until the reign of Saint
Louis that the first university dormitory
was erected. With its erection, the
teachers found it possible to hold their
classes in rooms of this building instead
of as formerly holding them in their own
private dwellings, in the open squares,
and in graveyards, with the tombstones
as seats.
Rich students attending the university
would live in taverns and have the lux
ury of a handle and bed. The poor stu
dents—and there were many of these—
slept wherever they could, in ash-barrels
or under the bridges that crossed the
Seine. Professor Hulme stated that
when lie visited Paris a few years ago he
found this still to be the practice with
many students.
The only language of the medieval
university was Latin. In and out of
classes, the students were compelled to
use this language exclusively. The uni
versity had spies among the students to
sec that at iTo time any of them spoke
another tongue. As a result of this rul
ing, every university town had its Latin
quarter; that is, where Latin alone was
spoken.
Students usually attended three lec
tures a day, each of three hours. Lec
tures started early in the morning; when
Luther was a professor it is recorded
that his classes commenced at 4 o'clock.
The "major sport" of the medieval
university, according to the speaker, was
playing the gentleman. Although per
haps poverty-stricken and starving, eacli
student would promenade up and down
the street dressed in the height of fash
ion. Playing the gentleman still remains
the "major sport" in European schools,
said Professor Hulme. In cutaway,
with gold-topped cane, highly polished
shoes, and gloves, the university student
can be seen today promenading along the
main boulevard conversing with his fel
lows and attracting the attention of the
opposite sex.
A prevalent custom among medieval
university students was to wander all
their lives from one school to another in
different parts of Europe, becoming "in
tellectual hoboes," according to the
speaker. Because Latin was the only
language used, it was possible to attend
first one university and then another.
Bloody fights between the townspeople
and students were frequent. Students
did not hesitate to rob, steal and murder
in order to be able to continue their col
lege education.
Conflict between church and univer
sity was characteristic of the Middle
Ages. The church stood for ecclesiasti
cal and external authority, the university
usually for the right of man to reason
for himself. The repudiation of ex
ternal authority and the enthronement
of reason in its place is a distinguishing
mark of the present age as contrasted
with the medieval period, according to
Professor Hulme.

Professor Hulme.
The university is not a characteristic
medieval institution, declared Professor
Edward Hulme of the History depart
ment last night in the Little Theater,
speaking on "Life in a Medieval Uni
versity." The university did not de
velop until the latter part of the Middle
Ages, about the thirteenth century; and
this institution, according to the speaker,
proved a powerful factor in destroying
the Middle Ages and inaugurating the
present era by substituting positive ideals
for the negative, inhibitory medieval at
titude toward life.
Professor Hulme described as typical
the University of Paris, "the mother of
all modern universities." At the height
of its fame, it claimed over 10,000 stu
dents from all lands. For a long time,
in this as well as in all medieval uni
versities, there were not any buildings,
lecture halls, campus, library, or labora
tory. It was not until the reign of Saint
Louis that the first university dormitory
was erected. With its erection, the
teachers found it possible to hold their
classes in rooms of this building instead
of as formerly holding them in their own
private dwellings, in the open squares,
and in graveyards, with the tombstones
as seats.
Rich students attending the university
would live in taverns and have the lux
ury of a handle and bed. The poor stu
dents—and there were many of these—
slept wherever they could, in ash-barrels
or under the bridges that crossed the
Seine. Professor Hulme stated that
when lie visited Paris a few years ago he
found this still to be the practice with
many students.
The only language of the medieval
university was Latin. In and out of
classes, the students were compelled to
use this language exclusively. The uni
versity had spies among the students to
sec that at iTo time any of them spoke
another tongue. As a result of this rul
ing, every university town had its Latin
quarter; that is, where Latin alone was
spoken.
Students usually attended three lec
tures a day, each of three hours. Lec
tures started early in the morning; when
Luther was a professor it is recorded
that his classes commenced at 4 o'clock.
The "major sport" of the medieval
university, according to the speaker, was
playing the gentleman. Although per
haps poverty-stricken and starving, eacli
student would promenade up and down
the street dressed in the height of fash
ion. Playing the gentleman still remains
the "major sport" in European schools,
said Professor Hulme. In cutaway,
with gold-topped cane, highly polished
shoes, and gloves, the university student
can be seen today promenading along the
main boulevard conversing with his fel
lows and attracting the attention of the
opposite sex.
A prevalent custom among medieval
university students was to wander all
their lives from one school to another in
different parts of Europe, becoming "in
tellectual hoboes," according to the
speaker. Because Latin was the only
language used, it was possible to attend
first one university and then another.
Bloody fights between the townspeople
and students were frequent. Students
did not hesitate to rob, steal and murder
in order to be able to continue their col
lege education.
Conflict between church and univer
sity was characteristic of the Middle
Ages. The church stood for ecclesiasti
cal and external authority, the university
usually for the right of man to reason
for himself. The repudiation of ex
ternal authority and the enthronement
of reason in its place is a distinguishing
mark of the present age as contrasted
with the medieval period, according to
Professor Hulme.
