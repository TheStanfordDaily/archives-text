# 'CARMEN' OPERA TO BE SECOND NUMBER IN MUSIC FESTIVAL
## Ina Bourskaja as Carmen and Giovanni Martinelli as Don Jose Will Have Main Roles 
### 
Two weeks from tonight "Carmen,"
an opeia in four acts by George Bizet,
will be presented in the Stanford stadium
as the second number in the spring musi
cal festival, "I Pagliacci" being the first.
Carmen, the heroine and a Spanish
gypsy, will be played by Ina Bourskaja,
the sensational Russian actress who has
been engaged for next season by the
Metropolitan Grand Opera Company.
The role of Don Jose, a brigadier in the
Spanish army, often interpreted by the
late Enrico Caruso, will be taken by
Giovanni Martinelli.
Vicente Ballester, baritone of the Chi
cago Opera Association, will play the
part of Escamillo, a bull-fighter and an
other suitor of Carmen's. The role of
Don Jose's quiet bride, Michaela, will be
taken by Bianca Saroya, beautiful so
prano, who was with the Boston Opera
Company and who has recently returned
from successes in European capitals.
"Carmen" is considered by opera
critics to be one of the best in the mod
ern French repertoire. The overture is
short but brilliant. After characteristic
choruses by the street lads, soldiers and
cigar-girls at the opening of the first act.
Carmen sings a quaint melody in which
the air is taken from an old Spanish
song. A serioys duet between Michaela
and Don Jose follows, while the next
striking number is a dance tempo sung
by Carmen while bewitching Don Jose.
The music for the second act is said
to be decidedly Spanish in tone, espe
cially that for the ballet. The opening
song of the gypsies in the cabaret to the
accompaniment of the castanets, is be
witching in its rhythm. In the next
scene Escatnillo describes the bull fight
in a stirring Toreador song.
The third act contains two striking
numbers, the terzetto of the card players
in the smugglers' haunt, and Michaela's
aria, "Io dico no, non son paurosa,"
claimed to be the most effective and
beautiful number in the whole musical
score. At the end of the act, the Torea
dor's song is again heard, as Escamillo
disappears in the distance after the quar
rel with Don Jose.
The final act is at the bull fight—the
Toreador's march, the stormy duet be
tween Don Jose and Carmen, and the
tragic end in which Carmen is killed,
being the most impressive numbers.
"Carmen" will be repeated on Friday
evening, June 16, as the last opera ot
this year's musical festival. Tickets are
