# CARDINAL SQUAD ARRIVES IN BOSTON IN GOOD SHAPE
## 
### 
Stanford's invading track team of ten
men completed its transcontinental jour
ney yesterday, arriving in Boston late
last night. The squad limbered up at
the Harvard track this afternoon, and
will do some light training tomorrow to
put themselves on edge for the prelimi
naries Friday.
The railroad trip has apparently had a
beneficial effect on the "cripples" of the
Cardinal delegation. The entire team
worked out at Stagg Field in Chicago on
Monday, and advices received from
Templeton have lifted what gloom there
was when the men left Oakland last Fri
day.
Morris Kirksey, who, it was thought,
was out of tlie 100 yard dash for the
season, ran a 9 4-5 century. Hanner's

back is almost entirely well, and he
hurled the javelin 196 feet.
"Tiny" Hartranft has apparently re
turned to his early-season form. In his
work-out at Chicago he put the shot 4?
feet 8 inches, and threw the discus 146
feet.
Templeton reports Falk's leg in bad
condition and the captain-elect may re
main out of the 120 event, conserving all
his strength for the 220 lows, which is
his best race.
The California and Cornell varsity
track teams will leave Ithaca, N. Y., this
evening for the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at
Cambridge Saturday. Dope in the East
favors Stanford, California or Cornell
to win the intcrcollegiates, with Har
vard and Princeton as likely contenders.
