# PHI DELTA THETA, ALPHA CHI SIGMA, AND CHI PSI WIN
## 
### 
Three good exhibitions of the dia
mond art were staged in intramural
baseball yesterday afternoon, and the
tie for first place in League One be
tween Phi Kappa Psi and Phi Delta
Theta was broken in favor of the
latter. The game was one of the
tightest played on an intramural dia
mond this year, and Phi Delta Theta
finally came out at the winning end
of a 3 to 2 score.
Phi Kappa Psi took the lead in the
first inning, scoring two runs on three
baggers by Richmond and Fish, com
bined with errors. In the third, Phi
Delta Theta combined a walk with two
errors for one tally, but the side was
retired with two men on the paths.
In the fifth frame, however, a series
of bobbles by Phi Kappa Psi allowed
two runs to cross the plate, and the
Phi Delta Theta men retained their
one-run lead to the finish. Phi Kappa
Psi attempted a rally in the last in
ning, but Edwards pitched good ball
and the losers failed to get further
than second base. Kraft did the re
ceiving for Phi ,(Delta Theta, with
Richmond and McAllister at the points
for Phi Kappa Psi.
Alpha Chi Sigma stepped out in
front in the first inning of its game
with Sigma Alpha Epsilon and stayed
there until the final put-out, though the
losers brought the final, count up to
6 to 5. Sidney, with a circus catch
of what would usually have been a
home run, took fielding honors for
Alpha Chi Sigma, and Dickey, the Sig
ma Alpha Epsilon first baseman, pick
ed up a grounder near the center of
the diamond and slid into first to re
tire his man unassisted. Few errors
were registered in this game. Knox
and Sullivan did battery work for
Alpha Chi Sigma, with Gifford and
Draper on duty for Sigma Alpha Ep
silon.
Chi Psi boosted its standing in the
percentage column by a 10 to 2 vic
tory over Sigma Nu. The ten runs
were manufactured out of four hits,
of which one was a four-base jolt by
Wilcox, with one man on base. Sigma
Nu made only two safe blows off Wil
cox's delivery. Gibbons, the Chi Psi
catcher, suffered a split finger in the
fourth inning and was forced to retire,
his place being taken by Ankele.
Dwight and Snook were the Sigma Nu
battery men.
