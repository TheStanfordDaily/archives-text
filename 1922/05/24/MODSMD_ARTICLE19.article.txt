There are some new names to Stan
ford show-goers in the cast of the 1922
Senior Farce, "Adam and Eva," as
announced today by Coach Gordon
Davis.
Dan Evans, '20, in the leading male
role, will come as the big surprise.
Although Evans has been connected
with the production of shows in other
capacities, he has not appeared upon
the stage in the memory of the pres
ent college generation. He acted
here before the war and took part in
"Justice."
Donaldine Cameron, '23, the leading
lady of "Wedding Bells," "Maid to
Order," and "The Charm School," has
been cast as Eva, to play opposite
Evans.
Robert Patton ,'22, will be remem
bered for his work in last year's farce,
"Clarence." He takes the part of an
elderly gentleman, James King.
Hal Baumbaugh, '22, was in the
Chappie show last fall, Hollis Chalm
ers took part in "Wedding Bells," and
"Koo Koo Kubistown," and Bill Shiels
was in the cast of "Pierre of the
Plains," "Koo Koo Kubistown," and
"Clarence."
All the rest of the characters are
new talent as far as the Stanford
stage is concerned.
"Adam and Eva," by Guy Bolton
and George Middleton, is a bright,
clean comedy of family life â€”human
and amusing. It deals with the uni
versal problem of domestic extrava
gance.
The farce will be given the last even
ing of finals.
