# PALO ALTO MERCHANTS PLAN "DOLLAR DAY"
## 
### 
Palo Alto merchants are planning a
"Dollar Day" for Wednesday, June 7, to
gain a wider realization of the superior
market and trading facilities of the town.
The business district of Palo Alto has
developed extensively within the last
year, and in recent months many new
stores and shops have been opened.
The general idea of "Dollar Day" is to
make the date a bargain carnival in all
stores participating.
