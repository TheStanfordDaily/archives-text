# WHERE CREDIT IS DUE

In the last couple of days several hundred men
have been out on the oval running, loping, heaving
the discus and the shot, and jumping, in the intra
mural track contest now going on. l he number turn
ing out this year is far in excess of last year and is
showing up some material, and that is the purpose of
the events as well as bringing into prominence the
intergroup rivalry around the campus.
Credit for this is due to C. S. Botsford, Director
of Intramural Athletics. Botsford has been the one
man who has kept the system of intramurals together
through the past three years and has brought the va
rious sports included in the list of intramurals up to
a place where the competition now is as keen in some
instances as though the games were between rival
institutions instead of groups all working in the same
place. It was due to his untiring energy that the
basketball games of last quarter could be run off in
the early morning when most of us would rather stay
in bed than get out and watch a game between two
teams that were interested only in themselves. But
Botsford was on the job in the morning and until
late in the evening, and it was his bright encourage
ment for the most part that made he season so suc
cessful.
Now at the end of the term when everyone is tired
and trying to put in time on his studies there are many
out for the different events on the track. If there
were not one pushing all this the competition would
fall through and a few defaults would leave the whole
thing in a mess. It is the wholesouled devotion of
Botsford to the system of intergroup sports that has
made them what they are today. We are lucky to
have a man who so cheerfully puts in his time with a
helping word here and there that serves to keep up
the spirit when it lags and keeps everyone on tip
toe all the time so that the best sort of results can be
made by all.
