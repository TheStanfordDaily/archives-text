# ONE MORE WEEK
## 
### 
Only a week now until nominations are due for
the many offices that must be filled for the student
body in the coming year. As yet there are not the
rumors going around the campus of the men who
are contemplated for the various positions. This
year the Daily will do all it can to bring before the
student body all the qualifications of each man for
his office. This will not be in the form of any elec
tioneering, but will be along the line of letting every
one get acquainted with the candidates for office, so
that there will be no excuse for not knowing who
a man is when he comes up for election. At the
election last year there were a number of the can
didates who were not known to members of the stu
dent body, and this was the case of men and women
in their third and fourth year. When such a condi
tion can exist in a student body as small as the
Stanford unit it is time things were changed and
this year there will be 110 excuse for saying that you
do not know the candidates when they come up at
the time of election. Articles will be welcomed by
the Daily from now until the time of election along
the line of electoral matter and will be run as such.
If there is any way in which interest in the elections
can be stimulated the Daily is for it and will welcome
all communications. Confidential matters will be
strictly treated as such.
