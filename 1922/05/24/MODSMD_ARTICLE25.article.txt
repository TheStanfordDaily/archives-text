Another skull found on the campus—but this one
was dead from the neck down, besides.

As Ed Lamb says, he sure was in the creek.

Accordington Prof. Willis, the cavities behind his
ears indicated that he had a bull neck. Which accounts
for a lot around here. At that, he couldn't have been
much of a necker.

Since the Stanford Man is going back east, Herbert

GEOLOGY JEOPARDIZED
"Say!" said the original Stanford Man, "get offa
here!"
Forthwith he pushed the Paleolithic frosh,- Stone
dome, *928746, (B.C.) off the Law cliff. Stonedome
shouted "T'hell with '928745!" and that started it. He
lit out for the library, where he could at least throw
books at his enemies and perhaps stone them to death.
But three sophs were upon him, their overhanging
brows beetling in the breeze. Hastily replacing his sand
stone dink on the back of his neck, Stonedome turned
to face them.
It would have gone hard with Stonedome, but for one
thing. She was walking along the Outer Ledge to the
Engineering Peak. It was Geraldine Caveman, and she
sure wore a mean bearskin; especially since she had
written to papa and said she wouldn't wear anything
older than a three weeks' cub. The three turned, and
in the excitement the frosh broke loose.
"Aw, these co-eds —" growled one, a bored expression
on his wooden face. The other, who a snake, twirled
his back hair and said nothing. Then it happened.
Stonedome, with an appearance of casualness, dropped
into step with the paleolithic belle, and pulled the old
formula: "Pardon, but isn't this your eversharp chisel?
You dropped it in class." She, of course, accepted the
instrument and walked on, with the same self-satisfied
though vacant expression as before 011 her beautiful,
underslung face. Stonedome felt that he was now a big
man 011 the campus.
"You will queen on the Quad, hey?" said the aveng
ing sophomores, and tossed the frosh the remaining
thousand feet into the creek.

SECOND THOUGHT.
(By Launcelot Lump*
I like to be a social guy,
And heave a line until I'm dry;
I always have to spread the salve
And 011 the bull I never halve.
In fact, some birds would think me cracked.
To hear the stuff I toss intact.
I like to give a man the mitt
When he comes in to bum a jit,
And loose a crack about the jack
He lost last night from one blue stack.
There's only one that makes me run.
Or sound off like a half-cocked gun.
I'd like to biff this simple stiff
And sink one in his fat midriff.
He shoots hot air, he takes a stare
At all the books; hangs on my chair;
When I face fifty pages or ruin
He pipes up with: "Say! Watcha doin'?"
* • *
"Does that girl know jiu jitsu?"
"Naw, she can't even trip up an aisle."

Yeah, the old place ain't what it used to was. The
milestones in the procession of years loomed up pretty
strong, but there were some that highbrowed even
those behind them. As Uncle John remarked, "They're
even going to move the Inn because some one is thought
to have hidden out a case in the cellar.

Didn't discourage him, though. Takes a lot to dis
courage the old-timers. For instance, the self-confessed
pioneers:
Zah Zah Zeer!
We're Right Here!
Ninety-Five, Ninety-Five
Pioneer!
Then the upstart class of '96:
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Rah! Rah! Rix!
M D Three C
X C Six!
(Signals off)
By that time they were getting intellectual, and talked
in Siwash: —
Hepta Ki! Nakonta!
Ninety-Seven!
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Then it started:
Whoopity! Whoopity!
Ha Ha Ha!
Naughty One! Naughty One!
Rah Rah Rah!
Now look:
Hickety Hickety!
Wah Hoo Wall!
Naughty Two! Naughty Two!
Rah Rah Rah!
(Horrors)
The social lions: —
Naught Four!
We Roar!
We Roar!
Naught Four!
Stanford!
Rickety Rackety!
Ree Ro Rix!
Rah Rah Stanford!
Naughty Six!
(This is too much)

"About this time before the big meet," announced
Hugo, the midnight moth, by radio from Boston, "they
were predicting an 85-46 score for Cal."
