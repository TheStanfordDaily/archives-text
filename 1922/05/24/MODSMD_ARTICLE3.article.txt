# Freshman-Sophomore Debate Is Cancelled
## 
### 
The freshman - sophomore debate,
which was scheduled for next Wednes
day, has been cancelled. Second-year
men, due to the difficulty of finding
speakers to represent them, were com
pelled to forfeit the debate to '25. The
ruling that men who have been on var
sity debating squads are barred from
participating in this contest eliminated a
number of sophomore debaters.
