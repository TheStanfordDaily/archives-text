# Gardens of New Union Will Form Background Of Senior Ball Dinner
## 
### 
The gardens of the new Union will
form the setting for the dinner of the
Senior Ball, according to the plans
made at the meeting of the senior com
mittee, last evening.
Mission-style decorations in keeping
with the Spanish architecture used in
the group of buildings of the Stu
dents' Union will enhance the beauty
of the formal gardens. The court yard
will be lighted by lanterns, and small
tables seating from four to six per
sons will be placed about the lawns.
Dinner will be served directly from
the kitchens of the new Union.
Miss Handy of the new Union has
promised the Senior Ball Committee a
menu which is considered far superior
to any of those included in the bids of
the San Francisco and San Jose cater
ers. During the dinner and between
courses musical entertainment will be
given.
In choosing the Women's Clubhouse
in preference to the basketball pavili
on for dancing the committee took
several things into consideration. The
pavilion would be much too large for
the probable hundred and twenty-five
couples to fill, and it would be neces
sary to spend a great deal of money
on decorations in order to screen off an
area in the middle of the building.
In addition to this, the kitchen facili
ties of the pavilion are not comparable
to those of the new Union, and caterer
service would be required. The com
mittee believes that it can provide
elaborate decorations for the club
house at a cost much less than for
the pavilion. The difference in ex
pense will be spent on the dinner, mu
sic and programs.
