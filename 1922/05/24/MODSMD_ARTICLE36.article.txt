# OREGON THETA SIGMA PHI'S ABOLISH JUNIOR WEEK PLEDGE SYSTEM
## 
### 
Theta Sigma Phi, women's national
honorary journalistic fraternity, has
abolished one Junior Week-end custom
by not pledging upperclass girls in the
school of journalism at the campus
luncheons. Scroll and Script and Fri
ars alone conferred honors.
Because of a new national ruling,
Theta Sigma Phi is unable to pledge
any upperclass girls before the open
ing of school next fall. This will mean
the abolishing of one custom and the
inauguration of a new one. It is the
policy of the organization to take in
as members each year those women
who have shown the greatest ability

in journalism.
Pledging will take place at the
Homecoming luncheon given during
the fall term, and Theta Sigma Phi' 3
and their pledges will then edit the
eight-page paper which has been a
traditional Junior Week-end event un
til this year. In order that the active
girls might have an opportunity this
year to test their journalistic ability,
it was decided to take over the regular
Emerald for one day.
Girls who have held Emerald staff
positions throughout the year assisted
in covering campus news and work
ing on the copy desk. Only one man
was permitted to retain his position
on the staff, and on account of the all
night vigil kept by girls in previous
years, the night editor was not only
permitted, but asked to keep his regu
lar position.
