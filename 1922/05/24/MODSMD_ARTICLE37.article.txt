## 
### 
Track and field events in the 1924
Olympic Games in Paris will cover the
afternoons of nine days, which will in
clude the dedication of the stadium and
the parade of athletes of all nations. This
was learned yesterday by members of
the American Olympic Committee upon
receipt of a tentative schedule from the
International Committee.
The all day gruelling trials such as
marked the London, Stockholm and Ant
werp meets, will be done away with.
The finals of at least two events will
be held every day and at times, two
trials will be under way simultaneously.
