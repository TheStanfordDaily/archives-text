## 
### 
President Wilbur has received a re
quest from headtjtiarters of the 91st Di
vision at the Presidio in San Francisco
that he support the Citizens' Military
Training Camp to be held there from
July 27 to August 25, inclusive, to which
Stanford students are eligible.
Dr. Wilbur recommends to all who
find it possible that they participate in
this month's training.
Courses will be given at the Presidio
camp in infantry, cavalry, field artillery,
air service, engineers and signal corps
duties. In most of these subjects three
different courses will be offered accord
ing to the man's previous knowledge and
training.
The War Department, under whose di
rection the training camp is conducted,
will provide transportation to the camp
and return, board, lodging, medical at
tention, uniforms, equipment, arms, am
munition, laundry, athletics and recrea
tion.
A good deal of attention will be paid
to athletic and recreational activities. No
obligation for future military service

join the National Guard or the organized
