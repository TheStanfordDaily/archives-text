# CLEAN-UP WORK IN STUDENT ENDOWMENT ENDS FRIDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
The total of the entire student en
dowment campaign has reached $125,-
000, with the addition of $3000 re
ported at a meeting of the clean-up
committees in the Union last night. So
far students interviewed in the clean
up effort, have pledged $12,000, with
little more than half of the number
listed not yet seen by the canvassers.
Final reports will be made at 8
o'clock, Friday night, at a supper in
the Union. This is the date set for
the alumni endowment campaign to
leave California, for the first time, and
there is a pressing need, say endow
ment officials, for a 100 per cent re
port at this meeting.
Comptroller Roth and endowment
director Pierce will carry the cam
paign to the eastern cities and states,
the plan being to close the "First
Million" stage of the effort at Wash
ington, June 15.
A quota of $900,000 has been set by
the campaign directors as the amount,
which must be reached before the
campaign is carried out of the state.
The total is now $875,000', the can
vassers now being engaged in an ef
fort to get the remaining $25,000 be
fore the end of the week. It is point
ed out that the students can again be
the means of stimulating the whole
campaign, and Director Pierce has
sent out an appeal to the campus work
ers to make a complete clean-up by
Friday night.
