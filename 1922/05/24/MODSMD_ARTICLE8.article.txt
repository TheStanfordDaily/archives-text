# GOOD MARKS MADE ON SECOND DAY OF INTRAMURAL TRACK
## McPherson and Colgan Tie for First in Hurdles; Hays is Winner in the Broad Jump 
### 
Broad jumpers and 120-yard low hurd
lers competed yesterday in the second
day of the intramural track meet. The
best time in the hurdles was made by
McPherson and Colgan, who tied for
first with 14:2 seconds. Anderson,
Johns and Marquis were second with
14:3. Only ten men got over the bar
riers in less than 15 seconds. This event
was completed yesterday, as there will
be no finals.
The results of the broad jump were
unexpectedly good. Nine men went over
19 feet. When it is remembered that 19
feet 4 inches won first place in the Cali
fornia meet four years ago, these marks
seem good. Hays made the best jump of
the day with 19 feet 9 inches, Arthur and
Brooke were close seconds with 19 feet
8 inches. The finals of this event will
be held next Monday, with the 100-yard
dash. The men who jumped more than
18 feet will be entered.
Today the half mile will be the only
event at the cinderpath. This is a hard
race and it is expected that it will take
most of the day to run it off. The pre
liminaries will be finished tomorrow
with the eight man 220-yard relay.
Coach Botsford believes that this is the
best event in the meet and wants every
live organization to have a good team on
the field. The meet will probably not be
completed until the middle of nc*\t week.
Several trophies will be given to the
winning organizations this year. The
organization which makes the greatest
number points will get a large plaque.
Plaques will also be given to the winner
of the 100-yard dash and to the best all
around athlete. At present Jim Arthur
seems to be the most likely man to get
the prize for general ability. He has
taken first in the shot put, second in the
broad jump and traveled the 100 yards
in les sthan 11 seconds. Colgan also
stands high with 10:1 in the hundred and
14:2 in the hurdles.
