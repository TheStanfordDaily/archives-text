# Letter Expresses High Regard For Kerr at Pittsburgh University
## 
### 
The following appeared in the "Pitt
Weekly," the publication of Pittsburgh
University, where Andrew Kerr is com
ing from. It shows the high regard
held for Kerr in the eastern college
and gives something of what may be
expected of him here:
"Pitt will have to find a new basket
ball coach for next year as a result
of the announcement of Coach Andy
Kerr's signing a five-year contract
with Leland Stanford University as
football and basket ball coach. The
announcement hardly came as a great
surprise, as it had been known that
Stanford wanted Kerr badly as an all
year coach. Mr. Kerr's natural affili
ations are in Pittsburgh and he did not
see his way clear to accept Stanford's
offer the early part of the year. How
ever, the lure of the land of golden
opportunity proved to be too great and
Coach Kerr will go west in Septem
ber to take charge of football at the
coast institution.
"Mr. Kerr will be sorely missed at
Pitt. Through his successes in foot
ball, basket ball and track he has made
a reputation for himself as one of
the leading coaches of the country in
each of those sports. Men who have
played under Mr. Kerr at Pitt will
swear by him. He has a very intimate
knowledge of all sports and is a na
tural teacher, having ability to the
fullest extent to impart his knowledge
to the players. His friends, however,
claim that his greatest success came
from his ability to instill fight into his
men. Coach Kerr, along the sidelines,
never knew what defeat meant and his
players always went into the game
with the same spirit.
"In more ways than one will Mr.
Kerr be missed. He is not only a
great coach, but he is a man. He has
always stood for the things that were
cleanest in all athletics and has al
ways had the greatest respect of all
with whom he came in contact. Coach
Kerr understands boys and men very
thoroughly and his work for the good
of boys around Pittsburgh has made
him an invaluable citizen of this com
munity. By vocation a teacher, by
avocation a coach, he has nevertheless
had many other interests and has gone
into all of them with the same zeal
that has characterized his attempts at
all times to give Pitt winning teams.
Mr. Kerr is at present Sabbath School
superintendent and an elder in the
Second Presbyterian Church of Wil
kinsburg.
"Men of Mr. Kerr's type are very
rarely to be found, unfortunately, and
we are mighty sorry to see him go. It
is Pitt's loss, Pitt students' loss, Schen
ley High School's loss, Pittsburgh's
loss, and Winkinsburg's loss. We have
not the slightest hesitancy in predict
ing for him the greatest of success
at Stanford. Mr. Kerr is the kind of
man that is always a success in every
thing that he goes into. Watch him
at Leland Stanford."
