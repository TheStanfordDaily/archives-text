# RELAY COMPLETES PRELIMINARIES IN INTRAMURAL TRACK
## Thirty Men From 103 Entries Reach Finals in Half-Mile; Gurley, Horn, Under 2:11 
### 
Intramural track preliminaries were
completed today with the relay held
this afternoon. Instead of the usual
440 yard runs, the relay this afternoon
was 220 yards with eight men running.
The relay championship was won last
year by El Campo, and judging by
present* indications they will have
strcng competition this year.
The 880-yard dash was the only
event held yesterday, the third day
of the meet. Gurley, Sigma Nu, made
the best time, 2:10.1; Horn, Encina,
was second with 2:10.4; and Thayer,
El Toro, and Radcliffe, Breakers, both
made 2:11.4. Of the 103 entries in
the 880, only seven failed to finish.
Thirty men qualified for the finals by
running the heat under 2:20, which
will be run off next week.
At present it is thought that it will
be impossible to complete the meet
before the middle of next week. The
finals of four events are still to be
held, and no work can be done on
Tuesday because of the Memorial Day
program.
The three leading contenders for
the prize as all around athletes are
Arthur, Colgan and McPherson.
Arthur has already taken first in the
shot and second in the broad jump,
besides a good mark in the 100 yards.
Colgan crept up a notch on Arthur by
running the half mile in 2:14. Mc-
Pherson has made the finals in three
events; the 220 hurdles, 100 yards, and
half mile.
