## 
### 
"It will be a regular three-ring circus,''
is the way Mrs. Timothy Hopkins de
scribed the Circus and Horse . Show
which will be given on the A. G. C. Hahn
estate in Menlo Park June 10 for the
benefit of the Stanford Home for Con
valescent Children.
The University will send ten sections
of portable bleachers for use at the Cir
cus. Tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock
two University trucks and two military
transports will be at the varsity tennis
courts or the basketball pavilion. All
students who can do so are asked to
help load the trucks and set up the
bleachers on the Hahn estate. Students
arc asked to co-operate so that labor
charges need not be taken from the bene
fit funds which will provide a graduate
nurse and two student nurses for the
new addition to the Convalescent Home.
A quarter-mile track has been sur
veyed and laid out on the Hahn property.
In the middle of the oval is a large saw
dust ring. Four children will do circus
riding in the ring, and there will be ex
hibitions of bronco breaking by several
experienced riders. A few famous
horses will perform—one of which is
the trick horse of F. W. Frehe. Mrs. An
derson's police dog, Rintintin, a star of

the motion pictures, will be one of the
show features.
Events to take place on the quarter
mile track include pony races by the
children and a Roman race by the riders
from Stanford. The circus will open
with a procession headed by the little
Queen o$ the Circus and her retinue.
Many bi>ys and girls of Menlo and Palo
Alto will take part in this parade, which
promises to be one of the most popular
features of the circus.
A dress rehearsal will be held on the
field next Saturday in order that Mrs.
Pike, who is training the performers,
may put the finishing touches to the va
rious acts.
Ihe first benefit of this kind for the
Convalescent Home was given by eight
Menlo children two years ago. Although
the performance was sponsored solely by
the children, the net profit amounted to
$500. Last year, with adult committees
managing the circus, $10,000 was added
to the endowment fund for the Conval
escent Home, and this year's benefit is
intended to be an even greater financial
success.
The circus committee is composed of
the following: Mesdamcs A. G. C. Hahn,
Timothy Hopkins, W. P. Weir, Gus Tay
lor and R. E. Frasicr.

Ihe first benefit of this kind for the
Convalescent Home was given by eight
Menlo children two years ago. Although
the performance was sponsored solely by
the children, the net profit amounted to
$500. Last year, with adult committees
managing the circus, $10,000 was added
to the endowment fund for the Conval
escent Home, and this year's benefit is
intended to be an even greater financial
success.
The circus committee is composed of
the following: Mesdamcs A. G. C. Hahn,
Timothy Hopkins, W. P. Weir, Gus Tay
lor and R. E. Frasicr.
"It will be a regular three-ring circus,''
is the way Mrs. Timothy Hopkins de
scribed the Circus and Horse . Show
which will be given on the A. G. C. Hahn
estate in Menlo Park June 10 for the
benefit of the Stanford Home for Con
valescent Children.
The University will send ten sections
of portable bleachers for use at the Cir
cus. Tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock
two University trucks and two military
transports will be at the varsity tennis
courts or the basketball pavilion. All
students who can do so are asked to
help load the trucks and set up the
bleachers on the Hahn estate. Students
arc asked to co-operate so that labor
charges need not be taken from the bene
fit funds which will provide a graduate
nurse and two student nurses for the
new addition to the Convalescent Home.
A quarter-mile track has been sur
veyed and laid out on the Hahn property.
In the middle of the oval is a large saw
dust ring. Four children will do circus
riding in the ring, and there will be ex
hibitions of bronco breaking by several
experienced riders. A few famous
horses will perform—one of which is
the trick horse of F. W. Frehe. Mrs. An
derson's police dog, Rintintin, a star of

the motion pictures, will be one of the
show features.
Events to take place on the quarter
mile track include pony races by the
children and a Roman race by the riders
from Stanford. The circus will open
with a procession headed by the little
Queen o$ the Circus and her retinue.
