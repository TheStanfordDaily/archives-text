BOSTON, MASS., May 25.—Stanford's ten track stars, after a hard trans
continental journey, appear to be in as< good shape as they have been all sea

First hostilities in the battle for the cinder path championship of the
United States, with Stanford and California as the standard-bearers of the
West, will start tomorrow morning at the Harvard stadium and continue
throughout the day. The ordinary athletes in the large entry list of the I. C.

A. A. A. A. will be eliminated in the
preliminary trials, so that the field
will be left dear for the stars on Sat
urday.
On the shoulders of Andy Moakley,
veteran coach at Cornell, rests the
burden of carrying his Ithacans to the
victory which will retrieve the laurels
of the east in the track and field world.
Sporting writers scattered throughout
the country predict a three-cornered,
battle, with Stanford, California and
Cornell as the combatants. Christie's
men, by reason of their victory last
year, and their large representation
this year, rule as favorites.
Stanford is accorded only that time
worn "fighting chance" to realize her
three-year ambition of a national
championship. Dispatches from the
East indicate that Templeton will not
enter Hartranft in the hundred, al
though the weight star wants to run.
If all of the ten Cardinal entries quali
fy tomorrow, the fight will be half
won, for the team that has the largest
number of first-class performers in the
finals, will win.

have overlooked first class men in
their reckonings. The quarter mile
tion at Arlington, Virginia, just outside
Washington. The result of his demon
strations at Arlington caused the U. S.
Navy to adopt the Poulsen system. Dur
ing the war he rendered extremely val
uable service to the Allies by aiding them
to establish high power efficient radio
stations giving them prompt and reliable
means of communication over long dis
tances.
For the British nation he put up a sta
tion in Ireland connecting with Canada;
for France he equipped the Eiffel tower
in Paris as a radio station, and con
structed a station in Salonika which en
abled Paris to keep in touch with the
eastern branch of the French army;
built and equipped stations at Toulon,
Lyons and Nantes, the last being de
cidedly valuable since it established
trans-atlantic connection for the French
navy, utilized to protect the American
army transports.
At the height of the war he was hur
riedly summoned to Rome and urgently
implored to establish a station to enable
Italy to communicate directly with the
United States and thus avoid the delays
which the Italian Government had been
suffering through being forced to relay
its messages through England and
France. Marconi was then in the gov
ernment service but had been unable to
establish this long distance connection.
Elwell built the three towers, each 714
feet high, in record time. In this work
he was assisted by Sumner Wing, '14,
son of Professor C. B. Wing. So anxious
were the Italian officials over the out
come of his work that they ignored his
request for 24 hours of experimental
work, and gathered around the sender
when the first attempt was made to reach
America. The very first message tried
went through clearly and brought an
immediate response from the United
States end. For this Elwell was deco
rated by the Italian king.
At the present time Elwell's company,
C. F. Elwell, Ltd., with headquarters in
London, operating as an independent
concern not connected with the big com
bination of such companies, is rendering
a service to the general public through
its independence of this "trust" and is
also operating closely with the British
government in establishing the Imperial
Wireless Chain.
The chief activity of this company is
the designing and construction of high
power stations, but various branches
cover practically all divisions of radio
development.
Elwell's present greatest interest is in
the "three-electrode transmitting tube,"
which he regards as the successor of the
Poulsen system. The new transmitting
tube is made out of rock crystal which
is fused and formed into a cylinder 4 l / 2
inches in diameter and 12 inches long,
with 18,000 volts applied to one of the
electrodes. One of these lamps or tubes
will put 8 kilowatts in an ordinary aerial.
To do this with the arc generator would
take a 15-kilowatt machine weighing half
a ton.

Elwell built the three towers, each 714

he was assisted by Sumner Wing, '14,
son of Professor C. B. Wing. So anxious
were the Italian officials over the out

request for 24 hours of experimental
work, and gathered around the sender
when the first attempt was made to reach

The chief activity of this company is
the designing and construction of high

tube is made out of rock crystal which
is fused and formed into a cylinder 4 l / 2
inches in diameter and 12 inches long,

will put 8 kilowatts in an ordinary aerial.

battle, with Stanford, California and
Cornell as the combatants. Christie's
men, by reason of their victory last
year, and their large representation
this year, rule as favorites.
Stanford is accorded only that time
worn "fighting chance" to realize her
three-year ambition of a national
championship. Dispatches from the
East indicate that Templeton will not
enter Hartranft in the hundred, al
though the weight star wants to run.
If all of the ten Cardinal entries quali
fy tomorrow, the fight will be half
won, for the team that has the largest
number of first-class performers in the
finals, will win.
Provincialism has played its part in
the predictions and "dope," for a great
many of those who "profess to know"
have overlooked first class men in
their reckonings. The quarter mile
tion at Arlington, Virginia, just outside
Washington. The result of his demon
strations at Arlington caused the U. S.
Navy to adopt the Poulsen system. Dur
ing the war he rendered extremely val
uable service to the Allies by aiding them
to establish high power efficient radio
stations giving them prompt and reliable
means of communication over long dis
tances.
For the British nation he put up a sta
tion in Ireland connecting with Canada;
for France he equipped the Eiffel tower
in Paris as a radio station, and con
structed a station in Salonika which en
abled Paris to keep in touch with the
eastern branch of the French army;
built and equipped stations at Toulon,
Lyons and Nantes, the last being de
cidedly valuable since it established
trans-atlantic connection for the French
navy, utilized to protect the American
army transports.
At the height of the war he was hur
riedly summoned to Rome and urgently
implored to establish a station to enable
Italy to communicate directly with the
United States and thus avoid the delays
which the Italian Government had been
suffering through being forced to relay
its messages through England and
France. Marconi was then in the gov
ernment service but had been unable to
establish this long distance connection.
Elwell built the three towers, each 714
feet high, in record time. In this work
he was assisted by Sumner Wing, '14,
son of Professor C. B. Wing. So anxious
were the Italian officials over the out
come of his work that they ignored his
request for 24 hours of experimental
work, and gathered around the sender
when the first attempt was made to reach
America. The very first message tried
went through clearly and brought an
immediate response from the United
States end. For this Elwell was deco
rated by the Italian king.
At the present time Elwell's company,
C. F. Elwell, Ltd., with headquarters in
London, operating as an independent
concern not connected with the big com
bination of such companies, is rendering
a service to the general public through
its independence of this "trust" and is
also operating closely with the British
government in establishing the Imperial
Wireless Chain.
The chief activity of this company is
the designing and construction of high
power stations, but various branches
cover practically all divisions of radio
development.
Elwell's present greatest interest is in
the "three-electrode transmitting tube,"
which he regards as the successor of the
Poulsen system. The new transmitting
tube is made out of rock crystal which
is fused and formed into a cylinder 4 l / 2
inches in diameter and 12 inches long,
with 18,000 volts applied to one of the
electrodes. One of these lamps or tubes
will put 8 kilowatts in an ordinary aerial.
To do this with the arc generator would
take a 15-kilowatt machine weighing half
a ton.
