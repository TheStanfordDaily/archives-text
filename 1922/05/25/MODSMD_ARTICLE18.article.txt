# INTERSECTIONAL BENEFIT
## 
### 
Cornell welcomed California to the East. The
sportsmanship and prowess of the Blue and Gold
team receives favorable comment atid is given due
credit for the win that was put over at the National
last year. Students at Cornell are
urged to get acquainted with the men of the Cali
fornia team and to see them work out on the field
in the afternoons before they leave for the meet at
Cambridge.
When the Stanford team was to be sent East
Cornell sent the same invitation to our men, offering
the courtesy of Cornell to them as long as they
should wish while one the eastern trip.
The strength of the institutions of the West is
(being more and more appreciated in the East as
the teams from the West come into prominence by
winning matches with the large colleges of the East.
The intersectional competition brings out one thing
invaluable in making a common feeling among the
different districts of the country. That is a good
understanding of the several colleges by each other
is obtained and the students realize that each insti
tution is not so very different from his own and
that all are driving toward one common end, making
good citizens for the country.
As far as Stanford is concerned, it is not likely
that we will attend more of the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meets. The distance is too far to undertake in the
middle of a quarter and charges of professionalizing
athletics are made more and more often when trips
are taken by men from one side of the continent
clear to the other.
We do not like to see these meets given up, be
cause of the good feeling that they do create, but in
the light of all the circumstances it is perhaps the
best that they should be ended and the rivalry cen
tered between the institutions of one part of the
country.
