# THEY MAY WELL BE PROUD

### 
The thirty-five men and women who received the
key of Phi Heta Kappa yesterday may be proud of
the record that they have set up while in college.
It is true that it takes every kind of person to make
up the world, and the one who devotes himself to
his studies is to be admired as much as the one who
gives his energy in some other line while he is in
college and so does not make more than a mediocre
grade. Of course the man who can combine both
activity and excellence in study is the one to get-the
magna cum laude, but he is a rarity, as will be seen
by glancing over the list named in any election.
The two fields are, however, for the most part
entirely different and the man or woman makes the
choice which is the one to follow in order to get
the most satisfaction when a look is taken at the
record after all is over and the diploma is handed
out. Those who pursue study and get the most out
of it are to be congratulated as having done the best
in the line they went in for. Their reward is a
mark of distinction that anyone would cherish.
