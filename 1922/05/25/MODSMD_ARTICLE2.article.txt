# POLITICAL "EXPERT" REVIEWS SITUATION
## 
### 
There arc only six more days until the
opening of the nominations for all the
student body and class officers. From
1 o'clock today there are only 144 hours.
This amounts to a matter of<B64U min
utes, and every minute lost now in con
templation of a candidate for some of
fice for the next year is a minute that
can never be regained, for time lost be
fore an election is one of the most elu
sive of all things. Like the Boy Scouts,
the motto of the good electioneer should
be, "Be Prepared." Here it is less than
a week and no one has come out in the
open and announced his candidacy for
office. It is a slur on our small town
to have such a lethargic state existing
in our midst.
Milpitas would lie down and die with
shame if six days before the nominations
for justice of the pcacc were to be made
no one knew who the candidates were
to be.
Wonder who will occupy the chair left
vacant by the withdrawal of the Dan
Evans government? ' Some say that
they remember the time when McKlroy
jumped from an editor's desk to the ex
ecutive chair. Mr. On Dit of the Vie
Parissiene says history is due for a re
peat.
The '23crs are mum as to all of their
candidates. Probably the work of the
"Wise Birds" Club.
The sophs have organized a junta for
election purposes. They say they'll hunt
a candidate if they have to take him
from the freshman class.
Applications for leaves of absence
having placed the '25 members in such
a precarious condition it is doubtful if
there will be any candidates for offices.
Ben, Carl, Louie, and Mr. Fredericks
burg predict a big landslide for the Beer
Tti The Home ticket. Like their home
brew, there is an even chance of their
predictions falling flat.
That will be all from N. A. A. Good
night.
