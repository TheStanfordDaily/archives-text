The Daily lllini, in a scathing denunciation of
Theta Nu Epsilon, which it declares is "having its
final siesta before the deluge," likewise goes on to
state that "such a secret society is proud of its myste
rious rites and congratulates itself as a successful or
ganization when it has aroused widespread opposition
to its ideas and activities." Oregon has not suffered

through the activities of T. N. E. nor of any similar
organization for many years, and is not anticipating
that suffering. But recently a well organized move
ment on the campus in the form of solicitation for
the Ku Klux Klan in the usual mysterious manner,
brought to light the fact that Theta Nu Epsilon in its
palmiest days could not have exceeded the political
possibilities which the K. K. K. membership on a
college campus has spread open before it.
The University campus is no more a place for the
white-robed Ku Klux Klan, than is the great State of
Oregon. A passing fancy it is now, and naturally
it must attract the curious who are always anxious to
be on the "inside." But such an organization as this
must never be countenanced on a college campus, else
the administrative authorities will in the end meet the
same problems which they did in combatting Theta
Nu Epsilon, in the olden days.â€”Oregon Daily
