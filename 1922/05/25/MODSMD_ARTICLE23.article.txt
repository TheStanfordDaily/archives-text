Oswald was having the time of his life. He hadn't
had so much fun since the earthquake. There wasn't a
single fly in the ointment —not even a mosquito. His
cup of happiness was full and he was blowing the foam
off the top.
For Oswald had just heard that Circle "S" was giv
ing a dance, June 3.
—Advt.

"This light stuff is too frivolous for me," remarked
the physics student as he flunked the ex.

We mourn for Angus MacPherson;
As an actor, a likely young person,
But he landed in jail
For robbing the mail;
Which ended poor Angus' rehearsin'.

No, Heloise, a spirit level has nothing to do with pro
hibition, nor yet with spooks. Furthermore, a plumb
line bears no connection to the fruit industry.

We are also informed by the head of the Physics de
partment that Simple Harmonic Motion does not refer
to any of the new dances, as we had supposed.

The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la,
Are probably made of shellac.
And the lambkins that skip on the green, baa, baa,
Are mutton, and tougher than sac.

Speaking of that shoe display at the campus car line
depot, Willie the Frosh says he has a bright idea. As
long as none of the shoes displayed are mates, why not
hook the whole outfit? Then next week, the shoe com
pany, not wishing to have the odd shoes on its hands,
will display the mates of the first bunch. By a simple
process of acquisition, Willie the Frosh, will then have
five (5) pairs of shoes, practically free, you might say.'

Is the picket fence between your yard and the neigh

He was a Captain of Industry. If not a Captain, he
was at least a Second Lieutenant of Industry. He had
so much money that the national debt looked like his
income tax. He was head of such a large monopoly
that most people thought that he was one of the states
in the Union. Gwash, but he was successful.
Then he decided to go to college and pick up a little
neglected education. When he registered they signed
him up right off the bat for Econ. 1, along with a lot
of other frosh.
He flunked it.

The next entry in the great Cabbages' Dumb Contest
is the gent that says his life-long ambition has always
been to see a centipede hurdle race.

And then along comes a guy with the old weather
beaten relic of the Early Victorian period about register
ing as a Catholic, because he couldn't spell Episcopalian.
This one is allowed in the Contest only because of the
reverence we have for age.

This weeks' prize will be the handsome cork-tipped
cigarette paper.

Heard over the telephone:—"Hello, mister, is this
Friday?" "Yell, this is Friday." "Then, where's Robin
son Crusoe."

"What's the date?" "Sir, are you speaking chrono
logically or botanically?"

Know just how the '92 representative feels. Often
found ourselves giving the yell alone after every one
else had quit.

LAUDER, HARRY, LAUDER!
