# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
Bankers Act Where
Statesmen Failed
The International Bankers, among
whom Morgan is the dominating figure,
have been meeting in Paris in an at
tempt to accomplish what the Genoa
Conference failed to do by arranging the
credits necessary for European recon
struction. This is another incident—like
Harding's direct negotiation with the
steel and railroad chiefs during the past
few days—which suggests that the "in
dustrial and financial organization of the
world is in some respects more respon
sible and more reasonable than the po
litical organization.
News from Washington
Congress is still wrought up about the
proposed investigation of war grafters.
It is said that the Republican leaders are
going to prevent the investigation. At
torney General Daugherty is the center
of a mud-slinging campaign of charges
and counter-charges. The news that
freight rates have been reduced by order
of the Interstate Commerce Commission
and that President Harding has been
initiated into the legal fraternity of Phi
Alpha Delta reassures us that in spite of
the murky atmosphere of scandal we are
groping steadily back toward normalcy.
Ireland, on the Other Hand—
Ireland jumps from the frying-pan into
the fire. Warfare in southern Ireland
between Free Staters and Republicans
dies down while fighting in the north
flares up as never before. Yet the
British see something more ominous in
the union of Collins and De Valera than
in the guerrilla warfare in Belfast, l-'or
it seems possible that the union of the
southern forces may have been accom
plished by Collins going over to the Re
publicans rather than by De Valera en
tering the Free State camp, in which
case the Irish question is further from
solution than ever before.
