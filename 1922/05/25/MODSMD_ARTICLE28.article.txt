# GRAND OPERA BALLET HOLDS REHEARSAL ON CLIFF HOUSE BEACH
## 
### 
Rehearsals of the ballet of fifty which
will take part in the open-air grand opera
.productions in the Stanford stadium in
June, are being held on the beach near
the Cliff House in San Francisco. Natale
Carossio, the Italian ballet master who
was formerly identified with the ballet
at the New York Metropolitan Opera
House, is directing the work.
"While it may be a bit unusual to con
duct open-air dance rehearsals on the
Coast, they are the regular thing in Italy,
where the ballet is a national as well as
an operatic institution," explained Ca
rossio. "I have also rehearsed ballets in
the open air in New York. My plan here
is simply to get the girls accustomed to
open-air work."
The ballet divertissement of the fifty
best dancers obtainable will follow "I'
Pagliacca" on the opening night of June
3. In addition there will be a singing
chorus of 150, and an orchestra of 100
men recruited from the ranks of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra and sim
ilar musical organizations. The orches
tra will be under the personal direction
of Maestro Gaetano Merola, director-in
chief of the productions.
