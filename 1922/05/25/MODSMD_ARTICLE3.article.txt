# It's All Wrong, But Never the Less Is Quite the Fashion
## 
### 
The old, worm-eaten, flea
bitten plaint of the learned that â€¢
good looks and brains do not go
together may be true in some
places, and as far as humor and
brains going together, never, im
possible, it never has been and
never can be. The man who is
humorous may be funny but he
has not brains. He must be after
the style of the famous Irwin who
got both kicked out and flunked
out. The fact that he commercial
izes his mental void after entering
civil life and accumulates much
gelt is undecipherable. He is
without brains, that is a proven
premise; his success is one of the
phenomena of life.
The foregoing sounds like a lot
of bunk. It is. Nothing else. To
be quite personal without affront
we point to the appearance of the
bright light of humor, Tommy
Carskadon, in the list of Phi Beta
Kappas for the last election. The
mask of solemnity that hides the
humor of Tom's speech shields
some of the gray matter also, at
least so it would seem from the
Phi Bete choice. He is not alone,
Art Harzfeld, his immediate pre
decessor. as hammer wielder, hav
ing made the grade last year.
