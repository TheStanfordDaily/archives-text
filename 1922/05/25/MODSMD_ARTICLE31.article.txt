# COLLEGE INSTRUCTION ATTACKED IN ESSAY BY LITERARY CRITIC
## 
### 
"During my contact with almost 1000
college graduates since January 1910, I
have learned that some few had never
heard of Emerson, and less than a
score had read "Compensation" and
"Self-Reliance," declared T. H. Whip
ple of the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company, in a literary
criticism called "The Business Power
of Language," in which is stressed the
power of expression in modern-day
life. "If many of our best and most
worthy young men are from good but
uncultured families, and if our Tech
nical Schools have curriculums so con
gested with so-called scientific studies
as to preclude the cultural, then the
latter knowledge must be acquired in
after college life through the student's
own volition."
"Why do not the colleges teach
their students (he use of good Eng
lish before attempting to teach them
other things which are often beyond
their grasp." Whipple asks in his at
tack on modern day college instruc
tion. "It is no small percentage of
such graduates who are able to ex
press the simplest thought with con
ciseness and unmistakable clearness
to say nothing of grammatical and
rhetorical elegance." Language is the
translation of thought and thought
without language is practically value
less."
