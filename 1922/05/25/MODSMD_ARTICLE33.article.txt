UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON
(P.1.N.5.). â€”Kappa Psi, honorary phar
macy fraternity, has been suspended until
June, 1923, by the committee on student
welfare and discipline. The chairman of
the rushing committee and the regent of
the fraternity have been placed on pro
bation for the remainder of the academic
year.
"While a careful inquiry indicates that
no serious injury has resulted from this
particular offense," the report reads,
"this punishment is administered be
cause of the breach of a long standing
rule forbidding any and all endangering
practices in connection with the conduct
of such societies."
