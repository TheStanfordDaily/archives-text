# REYNOLDS' PORTRAIT IS HUNG IN GALLERY OF STANFORD MUSEUM
## 
### 
An original Joshua Reynolds, a por
trait of General William Keppel, hangs
in the south gallery of the Stanford
Museum. The painting is part of the
Timothy Hopkins collection and is one
of the few works of Reynolds that is
owned outside of England.
Sir Joshua Reynolds is the most
notable figure in the English school
of painting and was the first president
of the Royal Academy, in 1768. He
has been placed by art critics along
with the triumvirate of the greatest
Venetians, Rubens, Rembrant and
Velasquez. The weight and power of
Reynolds' work is best seen in his
noble male portraits, which are liisti
onical monuments as well as sympa
thetic works of art.
The portrait of Keppel holds a
double interest in that the General
was Reynolds' sponsor and one of his
best friends, having taken the artist
to Rome as his guest, in order that
he might study the masters. Keppel,
in British naval uniform, shows very
admirably Reynolds' ability to catcl
a lifelike expression.
