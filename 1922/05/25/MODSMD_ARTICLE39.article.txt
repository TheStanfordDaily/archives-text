## 
### 
"The Constitution of the United States
is the greatest human achievement since
creation," declared Harry F. Atwood of
Chicago, in discussing the federal Con
stitution at the Little Theater yesterday.
Atwood pointed out, however, that the
American people of the last half century
have # entirely disregarded the spirit of
the Constitution in favor of the modern
fallacy of democracy.
"The makers of the Constitution real
ized the value of the wise exercise of
the law of selection," continued Atwood.
"They provided for a representative and
not a strictly democratic government."
Atwood declared that the people, of
the United States should understand the
meaning and purpose of the American
Constitution. In describing the present
soviet regime as a democratic form of

national control, lie said, "The people of
today are advocating this type of gov
ernment and then wonder why it is not a
success." It was further pointed out
that national problems can never be
solved by submitting them to the impul
sive decision of the mass of the people.
Socialism has been experimented with
and has invariably resulted in a paralysis
of progressive national affairs.
The best way to combat the growing
tendency of the American people toward
a socialistic class consciousness, accord
ing to Atwood, is by following the true
spirit of the federal Constitution. "The
great duty of this generation is to make
clear the meaning of representative gov
ernment," he said in concluding his
speech.
Atwood is a graduate of the University
of Chicago, and at one time was assistant
attorney general. He has practiced law
in Chicago since 1899, and is the author
of several books, the most recent being
"Our Constitution the Antidote for Bol
shevism."
