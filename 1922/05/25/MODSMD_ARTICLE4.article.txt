# INTRAMURAL SERIES NEARS FINAL GAMES
## Phi Delta Theta, Alpha Delta Phi, and Sigma Chi League Leaders; Two Leagues Tied 
### 
Intramural baseball is rapidly Hear
ing the end of its season, the only
game scheduled before the inter-league
series being play-offs of ties in the
percentage column. Sigma Alpha Ep
silon has been allowed a forfeit in
stead of a defeat in Tuesday's match
with Alpha Chi Sigma, as the chemists
played several "ringers" from the En
cina team. This brings Sigma Alpha
Epsiloa into a three-cornered tie with
Beta Tlieta Pi and Encina for the
pennant in League Two. Encina and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon met this after
noon for the pirivilege of grappling
with Beta Theta Pi for first honors.
The issue is also in doubt in the
case of League Four; Kappa Sigma
irnd El Capitan being deadlock'd with
a percentage of 1000. This tie will
also be broken before the post-season
series. Alpha Delta Phi, Phi Delta
Theta, and Sigma Chi hold the lead by
decisive margins in the three other
leagues.
El Capitan kept its 1000 per cent
average well out of danger in its 15
to 3 victory over Theta Delta Chi in
the only scheduled game of the after
noon. Starting out with one run in
the initial inning, El Capitan pulled
steadily away out in front and after
the third frame was at no time in
danger. Theta Delta Chi's first tally
came in the fifth, when Spurway
doubled and Howarth, pinch-hitting for
Davidson, rapped out a two-bagger
down the first base line. Reichmuth,
with a home run, and Fehren and Stev
enson with triples featured at the plate
for El Capitan. Wassum and Fehren
were the winning battery men, with
Harker and McCready working for
Theta Delta Chi.
Alpha Delta Chi took on champion-
contain plenty of good baseball, and
it is impossible to hazard a guess
at the outcome. Kappa Sigma and
El Capitan will put on a close struggle
for leadership in their league, and
whichever team wins may be depended
on to do its share in the series. Alpha
Delta Phi has a smooth-running ball
club, and Sigma Chi will be strong if
they succeed in reorganizing. Phi
Delta Theta, though erratic, generally
plays at top efficiency in close com
petition, and the winner of the Beta
Theta Pi, Encina, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon combination is not to be omit
ted.
Alpha Delta Chi took on champion
ship timber in a practice game with
Sigma Chi, the victory going to the
former, by a count of 10 to 4. Sigma
Chi is still demoralized after the loss
of Captain Vaughan, who received a
broken leg in a game last week, and
will do well to pull a team together
in time for the finals. Batting honors
went to Sigma Chi, however; Meekin
doing a Babe Ruth with one on base,
and Krogness following with a triple
in the same inning. Loomis and
Widaman were batteries for Alpha
Delta Phi, with Macconel and Fox on
duty for the losers.

it is impossible to hazard a guess
at the outcome. Kappa Sigma and
El Capitan will put on a close struggle
for leadership in their league, and
whichever team wins may be depended
on to do its share in the series. Alpha
Delta Phi has a smooth-running ball
club, and Sigma Chi will be strong if
they succeed in reorganizing. Phi
Delta Theta, though erratic, generally
plays at top efficiency in close com
petition, and the winner of the Beta
Theta Pi, Encina, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon combination is not to be omit
ted.
Alpha Delta Chi took on champion
ship timber in a practice game with
Sigma Chi, the victory going to the
former, by a count of 10 to 4. Sigma
Chi is still demoralized after the loss
of Captain Vaughan, who received a
broken leg in a game last week, and
will do well to pull a team together
in time for the finals. Batting honors
went to Sigma Chi, however; Meekin
doing a Babe Ruth with one on base,
and Krogness following with a triple
in the same inning. Loomis and
Widaman were batteries for Alpha
Delta Phi, with Macconel and Fox on
duty for the losers.
Intramural baseball is rapidly Hear
ing the end of its season, the only
game scheduled before the inter-league
series being play-offs of ties in the
percentage column. Sigma Alpha Ep
silon has been allowed a forfeit in
stead of a defeat in Tuesday's match
with Alpha Chi Sigma, as the chemists
played several "ringers" from the En
cina team. This brings Sigma Alpha
Epsiloa into a three-cornered tie with
Beta Tlieta Pi and Encina for the
pennant in League Two. Encina and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon met this after
noon for the pirivilege of grappling
with Beta Theta Pi for first honors.
The issue is also in doubt in the
case of League Four; Kappa Sigma
irnd El Capitan being deadlock'd with
a percentage of 1000. This tie will
also be broken before the post-season
series. Alpha Delta Phi, Phi Delta
Theta, and Sigma Chi hold the lead by
decisive margins in the three other
leagues.
El Capitan kept its 1000 per cent
average well out of danger in its 15
to 3 victory over Theta Delta Chi in
the only scheduled game of the after
noon. Starting out with one run in
the initial inning, El Capitan pulled
steadily away out in front and after
the third frame was at no time in
danger. Theta Delta Chi's first tally
came in the fifth, when Spurway
doubled and Howarth, pinch-hitting for
Davidson, rapped out a two-bagger
down the first base line. Reichmuth,
with a home run, and Fehren and Stev
enson with triples featured at the plate
for El Capitan. Wassum and Fehren
were the winning battery men, with
Harker and McCready working for
Theta Delta Chi.
Alpha Delta Chi took on champion-
contain plenty of good baseball, and
