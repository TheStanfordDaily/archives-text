# DR. ADAMS LECTURES AT SAN JOSE MEETING
## 
### 
Dr. E. 1). Adams, head of the History
department, lectured at the Morris E.
Dailey hall of the State Teachers' Col
lege in San Jose yesterday evening on
the subject of "Cartoons of the Great
War from the Warring and Neutral
Nations."
Dr. Adams said that the cartoonist is,
and has been, a powerful factor in the
formation of public opinion. Through
the use of cartoonery, "those window
dummies of our public thought," as he
phrased it, the genius seizes die points
of greatest significance. He can quickly
impress the observer with the character
of a specific event or the trend of a
historical period.
The doctor, during his recent tour of
Europe for the collection of material for
the Hoover War Library, secured a large
collection of cartoons which he displayed
at the meeting, with accompaning com
ment.
