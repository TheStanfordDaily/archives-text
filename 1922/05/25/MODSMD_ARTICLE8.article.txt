# TORTOISE HASN'T ANYTHING ON THIS TRACTOR CONTEST
## 
### 
The race between the tortoise and
the hare must have been interesting
in a way, but a race between two tor
toises must have been more of an
even match. At any rate, two modern
tortoises will race at a speed of ten
miles an hour or thereabouts in the
tractor race which will be one of the
events of the military tournament on
Saturday afternoon. Hauling guns
which weigh slightly less than they
themselves, the tractors will show
what they can do in the way of artful
dodging, climbing obstacles and in
racing on the level. A course will be
prepared for the event on the polo
field, where the tournament will take
place.
