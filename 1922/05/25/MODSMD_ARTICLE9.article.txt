# RADIO ENGINEER IS VISITOR ON CAMPUS
## C.F. Elwell, '07, to Represent Great Britain in Selection of African Radio Stations 
### 
C. F. Elwell, '07, who was a student
under I rofessor Harris J. Ryan, began
experiments on the Stanford campus in
wireless communication which laid the
foundation for his present reputation as
probably the leading radio engineer in
the world, is the guest of Professor and
Mrs. Ryan on a flying visit from his
London of lice. With him are his wife,
his mother, Mrs. Rodolph Tudor of San
I"rancisco, and Airs. Elwell's mother,
Mrs. Marian Pullan of Woodland.
He will.leave Sunday for New York
and London on his way to Africa, where
he will investigate conditions with a view
to the selection of a site for one of the
stations of the Imperial Wireless Chain
which the British Government is setting
up between its dominions. He has re
cently completed the erection of a large
station in Egypt, which connects Egypt
with England.
Elwell in 1909 established between Sac
ramento and Stockton the first success
ful wireless telephone connection in the
United States. Over this stretch of fifty
miles lie sent wireless telephone mes
sages which were clearly received and
also high speed wireless telegraph mes
sages. Following that he established a
station on the beach at San Francisco
and sent wirfless messages around the
triangle constituted by Stockton, Sacra
mento and San Francisco.
His first experiments off the Stanford
campus were carried on in Palo Alto
and led to the establishment first of the
Poulsen Wireless Telephone and Tele
graph Company, and later to its succes
sor, the federal Telegraph Company, of
each of which he was chief engineer.
The Federal Wireless Company still
maintains its factory and headquarters
there.
In 1912 lie startled the world by con
necting by wireless with Honolulu direct
from Washington. Up to that time suc

from Washington even so far as San
Francisco.
He caused the Poulsen system to be
installed in the big government radio sta
