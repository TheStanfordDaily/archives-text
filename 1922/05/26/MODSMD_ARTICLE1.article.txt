# CARDINALS, BEARS AMONG FAVORITES IN NATIONAL MEET
## Paddock Gives Coach Templeton's Men 40 Points; Pennsylvania And Cornell Are Very Strong 
### 
BOSTON, MASS., May 26. (Special
Dispatch)— Perfect weather prevailed
as track and field athletes from thirty
colleges met in the preliminary compe
tition of the forty-sixth annual I. C.
A. A. A. A. championships, at the Har
vard Stadium. The track, which has
been rolled following the rain last
night, was unusually fast.
The incomplete summary of those
qualifying today are:
100-yard dash — Carter (Brown);
Patterson (Colgate); LoVejoy \ (Cor
nell); Graeb (Columbia); LeConey
(Lafayette); Lever (Pennsylvania);
McKim (Pennsylvania); Kirksey and
Sudden (Stanford); Muller (Wil
liams); Rusnack (Yale. >Best time
made by LeConey, :9 4-5 seconds,
which equals the intercollegiate rec
ord held jointly by Wefers (George
town); Craig (Michigan), and Patter
son (Pennsylvania.
880-yard run—Carter and Cook (Cor
nell); Schem (Dartmouth); Marstes
(Georgetown); Shields and Hallfrlsch
(Pennsylvania State); Brown (Penn
sylvania); Johnson (Princeton); Daly
(Stanford); Campbell (Yale). Best
time made by Brown of Pennsylvania,
1:57 1-10.
120 high hurdles—Merrick (Boston);
Henderson (California); Sollitt (Dar
mouth); Haurs and Whitney (Har
vard); Barron and Kauffman (Penn
State); Massey (Princeton). Best
time, 15 5-10 seconds, made by Whit
ney of Harvard.
440-yard run — Driscoll (Boston);
Hendnixsoni and McDonald (Califor
nia); Koppisch (Columbia); John
(Cornell); Ray (Rutgers); Stevenson
(Princeton); Monie (Syracuse); Chap
man (Yale). Best time, 50 seconds,
made by McDonald of California.
Shot put—Merchant and Witter
ACalifornia); Brounder (Pennsylva
nia); Thompson (Princeton); Hrat
ranft (Stanford); Jordan (Yale). Best
distance, 46 feet 2 inches, made by
Hartranft, Stanford.
Merchant of California, with a heave
of 171 feet, shattered the American
intercollegiate record in the hammer
throw. The former mark was 165 feet
made by Bailey of Maine in 1915.
By five o'clock tomorrow a new in
tercollegiate champion will be crown
ed, or else, by numbers, California will
have retained the laurels won by half
a point last year. If Templeton's ath
letes capture the title, it will be be
cause every one of them rises to the
occasion, for thirty institutions have
entered teams.
Embroiled in another athletic "civil
war," the east is afraid of its oppon
ents from the west, Stanford and Cali
fornia; westerners are fearful lest
Cornell and Pennsylvania will win the
honors.
Picked as a favorite by some sport
ing writers, passed over with a sen
tence or two by others, the Stanford
team has better than an outside chance
of victory. Kirksey and Sudden in
the sprints, Williamson in the quarter,
Daly in the half, Falk and Hayes in
the hurdles, Hartranft in the weights,

Hanner in the javelin, lilack in the
pole vault, and Minsky in the broad
jump form the strongest combination
that has worn" the Cardinal for sev
eral years.
Sudden, who has been mentioned in
frequently by the dopesters, is going
to be the surprise of the meet, accord
ing to Paddock, who picks the Cardi
nal to win forty points.
Templeton is the only coach who
has himself competed in the I. C. A.
A. A. A. Three years ago he was a
member of the first Stanford team to
the intercollegiates; this year he ent
ers his second team to the big event
—more or less of a veteran.
Officials in charge of the affair ar
ranged the preliminary heats today so
that the real rivals in each event would
not meet until tomorrow, thus post
poning the real test. Cornell entered
thirty-three men in the trials" today,
and Princeton and Harvard were alsa
represented by large squads.
In spite of the wholesome respect
for the ability of western athletes and
for the two teams, odds are five to
three on Lower Broadway, New York,
that an eastern university will cap
ture the championship. At that there
are few western takers.

880-yard run—Carter and Cook (Cor

(Georgetown); Shields and Hallfrlsch
(Pennsylvania State); Brown (Penn

(Stanford); Campbell (Yale). Best
time made by Brown of Pennsylvania,
1:57 1-10.
120 high hurdles—Merrick (Boston);
Henderson (California); Sollitt (Dar

distance, 46 feet 2 inches, made by
Hartranft, Stanford.
Merchant of California, with a heave
of 171 feet, shattered the American
intercollegiate record in the hammer
throw. The former mark was 165 feet
made by Bailey of Maine in 1915.
By five o'clock tomorrow a new in
tercollegiate champion will be crown
ed, or else, by numbers, California will
have retained the laurels won by half
a point last year. If Templeton's ath
letes capture the title, it will be be
cause every one of them rises to the
occasion, for thirty institutions have
entered teams.
Embroiled in another athletic "civil
war," the east is afraid of its oppon
ents from the west, Stanford and Cali
fornia; westerners are fearful lest
Cornell and Pennsylvania will win the
honors.
Picked as a favorite by some sport
ing writers, passed over with a sen
tence or two by others, the Stanford
team has better than an outside chance
of victory. Kirksey and Sudden in
the sprints, Williamson in the quarter,
Daly in the half, Falk and Hayes in
the hurdles, Hartranft in the weights,

Hanner in the javelin, lilack in the
pole vault, and Minsky in the broad
jump form the strongest combination
that has worn" the Cardinal for sev
eral years.
Sudden, who has been mentioned in
frequently by the dopesters, is going
to be the surprise of the meet, accord
ing to Paddock, who picks the Cardi
nal to win forty points.
Templeton is the only coach who
has himself competed in the I. C. A.
A. A. A. Three years ago he was a
member of the first Stanford team to
the intercollegiates; this year he ent
ers his second team to the big event
—more or less of a veteran.
Officials in charge of the affair ar
ranged the preliminary heats today so
that the real rivals in each event would
not meet until tomorrow, thus post
poning the real test. Cornell entered
thirty-three men in the trials" today,
and Princeton and Harvard were alsa
represented by large squads.
In spite of the wholesome respect
for the ability of western athletes and
for the two teams, odds are five to
three on Lower Broadway, New York,
that an eastern university will cap
ture the championship. At that there
are few western takers.
