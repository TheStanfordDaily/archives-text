# MARE ISLAND NINE PLAYS CARDINALS SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Baseball makes a post-season reap
pearance tomorrow afternoon on the
varsity diamond as Seay's cohorts hook;
up with the fighting nine from Mare
Island. The Marines have been winning
their games lately with a regularity that
promises strong opposition to the Cardi
nal horsehide experts. Admission to the
game, which starts at 3, will be free.
This contest is one of those scheduled
for the last of this quarter to get the
team in condition for the Honolulu trip
this summer. For a period of two weeks
after the California series, no practice
was held, and later the team came out
on the field two or three times a week
to keep limbered up. Now practice is
being held regularly, along with the com
petition furnished by outside teams.
This is the first time Stanford has met
the Marines this year on the diamond.
