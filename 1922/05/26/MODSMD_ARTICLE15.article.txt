# STUDENT OFFICERS ELECTED JUNE 7
## Nominations for Yearly Quad Election Open Wednesday Races Will Be Close 
### 
Campaign managers have groomed
their candidates for student body offices
and are getting them ready for the open
ing of nominations next Wednesday.
Nominations will close Monday, June 5,
and the election will be held the follow
ing Wednesday.
Early campaigning indicates that the
race for offices will be closer at this
election than it has been at any recent
one. But few times in the past have
more than a thousand voters gone to the
polls at quad elections. The contest for
president promises to be the closest of
all, as it was last year when Dan Evans
won from Mort Kline by a small margin.
Other officers who are retiring and
will leave vacancies are as follows: vice
president, Arthur Wilcox; secretary, A1
Taylor; executive committee, Grace
Brown, Ruth Davis, R. C. Connolly, Fred
Ludeke. These vacancies will necessi
tate the eletcion of a president, a vice
president, and a secretary from the stu
dent body at large and four class repre
sentatives to the executive committee â€”a
man and a woman from the class of 1923,
a woman from the class of 1924, and a
man from the class of 1925. Phil Landis,
'23, and Bob Titus, '24, retain their places
on the executive committee until the next
mid-year election. In addition to these
officers, five men are to be chosen for
the Men's Council, one student repre
sentative on the Board of Athletic Con
trol is to be selected, and officers for the
classes of 1923, 1924, 1925 will be elected.
In case that the staff of the Daily Palo
Alto fails to elect an editor, two candi
dates will be submitted at the election.
Lou Minsky and Chet Douglas, present
assistant yell leaders, will be candidates
for chief yell leader.
A box will be placed in front of the
Romanic Language Building to receive
nominations next Wednesday morning
and it will remain there until the follow
ing Monday.
