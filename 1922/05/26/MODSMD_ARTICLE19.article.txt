# MILITARY FIELD DAY
## 
### 
The Stanford unit of Field Artillery will give its
annual tourney tomorrow afternoon showing the
work that has been accomplished in the past year
under the direction of Major Collins and his staff of
assistants. The unit is now at the end of its season,
and the day tomorrow will give a fair indication of
the many things that have been gained by the train
ing during the last three quarters.
The Stanford unit being the only one of the kind
in the West enjoys a remarkable position in more
ways than one. It is absolutely a matter of a man's
own wish whether he join the battalion or not, and
nothing is forced on him as in other universities
where the military training is made a part of the first
two years' study. Here all the success that goes to
the military department must come from the interest
that it instills in the men to make them come out for
the activity.
It is the work that the officers in charge of the unit
put in that makes the course of study of interest to
the men in every branch of the work. From the first
elementary courses to the most advanced ones in
theory there is no lack of interest, and this is kept
up all the time by the hard work of the instructors.
It would be easy for them to make it a mere matter
of routine, and this would let the interest lag until
at the end of a quarter there would be a very small
representation in the unit.
Not only the regulation military courses are given
here, but the work being extended to equitation for
the women makes a matter of interest that might be
easily passed up if it were not for the officers. It is
the extra things on the curriculum that causes the
men and women to go out and take the courses when
they do not have to.
The field day tomorrow will have an excellent line
up of, events and will be of interest to all.
