# CHAPARRAL TAKES SECOND PLACE IN "JUDGE" CONTEST
## 
### 
The Stanford Chaparral was award
ed second place in the annual "College
Wits" contest, conducted by Judge,
last month. Cornell University barely
defeated Stanford for first place hon
ors. Judgement was made on basis
of grade points, with the winner ac
cumulating 668, while Stanford made
560. Cornell and Stanford were far in
advance of their nearest competitor,
Harvard, which made but 202 points.
This is the second time that the
Cornell Widow has won the cup award
ed to the victor in the contest. The
cup, however, must be won three
times before it becomes the perma
nent property of a competitor. Other
smaller awards were made for the best
cartoon and the best literary feature.
Stanford contributors to the Col
lege Wits number were Mike Ely, '24,
Fred Fisher, '24, Dick Blood, '21,
George Thompson, '22, Ted Van Deu
sen, *24, Thomas Carskadon, '22, Phil
Newill, '24, J. L. Devoto, '25, Thomas
Green, '22, Jordan Ownsby, '22, Dick
Smith, '23, Carl Shoup, '24, Hal Rorke,
'24, Ding Freer, '25, and Robert Moore,
