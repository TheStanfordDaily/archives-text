# HONOR STUFF
## 
### 
"Great gobs of Glory." Apparently the existing
bona fide and established honor societies of Stanford
are too narrow in scope. Persons dissatisfied with
the "honors" as distributed at present can, of course,
form new societies at any time. New grops of men
are getting together and honoring themselves every
day. A number of juniors, with their great wisdom
of university affairs, having decided things are not
correctly run, have organized, honored themselves,
and will now correct affairs. And a few sophomores,
unable to wait another year for honors, and probably
distrusting the selection that would be made by the
present juniors any way, took matters in their own
hands and have their own organization. As yet the
1925 class hasn't established an organization, and
there are no reports from next year's incoming fresh
men.
Of course these organizations are strictly "non
political." By appearances the junior choice and
limited organization has done little more than select
the class president, name committees, and direct
affairs of the class. Other "non-political" organiza
tions include the sophomore society, and the trick
organization of "better" fraternity men. The 1924
organization would not go into "politics" to any
greater extent than put a third-rate candidate from
its ranks into the Quad Manager's office.
These societies all have high aims and purj>oses,
at once as lofty, absurd, and ridiculous as "all uni
versity co-operation," "to unite the Ilall and Row,"

and to "hack all student functions." Limited honor
organizations function as political centers. The pres
ent new societies seem only a means of controlling
politics by a small group. If the men of these socie
ties really had all university co-operation, the good
of the student body, etc., in mind, they would not
show it by organizing limited groups which function
as political units, and which, by their very nature,
are calculated to excite enmity and dissention among
the remainder of students. If men had student in
terest and not personal aggrandizement of organiza
tion members in mind, they would not go on building
absurd units which can only complicate and separate
the members of the Stanford student body, instead
of uniting them in all-university purposes. And they
certainly would not put their hand to running student
offices.
