# WAITING FOR VICTORY
## 
### 
There is nothing in dope, but we may look to a
very creditable showing from our athletic contingent
in the East. The scores and some intimate sidelights
on the Cambridge meet will he flashed to the campus
by "Dink" after the meet. The student body dance
in the pavilion will be the place of announcing. Be
side helping the finances of the athletic budget you
will get some of the inside while at the dance tomor
row night.
