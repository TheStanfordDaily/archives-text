Did You Ever Play at Lacrosse?
Biology is taught in the universities of our land, but
the actual application of it is woefully rare. Take hy
brids, for instance. Cross something with another thing,
and get something else. The useful possibilities it sug
gests are almost unlimited.
Cross an alarm clock with an eggbeater and over
sleeping will be rendered impossible, if the hybrid is
placed near enough to the sleeper's face. (This is not
for ex-army men —it's too much like beating time.)
The ideal breakfast consists of a shredded Wheat
biscuit crossed with a slab of cream. If this doesn't
get across, try again.
Most of our liquor is also hybrid. One has to cross
the Canadian boundary with an automobile to get it.
Although that's dangerous, it isn't the only hybrid
that causes trouble. Look at all the accidents that come
as a result of railroad crossings. Even crossing the
street with a co-ed is sometimes unadvisable. If your
girl saw, you might get a crosscut.
Class-room work is different. If you see the professor's
cross, don't let him notice it. Double-crossing is carry
ing the matter a little too far. Ask the cross-eyed man
—his nose knows.
Finally, in justification to the science, may we say that
all distinguished biologists are cross-wise?

A lady frankly said so;
But if today, she talks that way,
Her partner must be dead slow.

■Feelings
How about
The time when
You take a book
Back to the libe
Two weeks overdue
With a fine of
Three dollars
Roosting on it
And the librarian
Is reading a letter

In a pink envelope
And just grins
And tosses your book
On a shelf?
Huh?

And in the next cage, ladies and gentlemen, we have
the far-famed How-Wow bird. This bird is a native of
the desert lands of northern Africa, and so severe are
the sandstorms of its native haunts that in the course
of countless thousands of generations it has developed
the peculiar properties that give it it? name. For this
bird, upon the approach of a standstorm, emits a loud
squawk and immediately starts flying backwards to keep
the grit out of its eyes.

Cleo's secret has never been divulged. No one will
never know that Cleo acquired her husband through ?
course in "Love, Theory and Practice" which she took
from an Egyptian Correspondence School. And we who
know co-eds will forgive her her temperamental fits
. . won't we, Horace?
