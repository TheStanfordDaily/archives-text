(The following letter from the Comp
troller's Office was received yesterday.
The University has done all it can to
mitigate the speed evil on the campus
and now lias had to turn to the county
authorities for enforcement. As they
say, it is too bad but necessary. We are
all for it.â€”The Editor.)
Dear Mr. Editor: Some time ago you
were kind enough to call attention,
through your columns, to the fact that
the provisions of the State Motor Ve
hicle Act apply to the Stanford campus.
I am writing to request that you also
give publicity to the fact that the Uni
versity has requested the county authori
ties to enforce the provisions of the Mo
tor Vehicle Act on the Stanford campus.
I have no doubt that the county officers
will find it possible to undertake the en
forcement of the traffic regulations, and
if so, students and others hereafter will
have to answer to the civil authorities
for violations of the traffic laws.
Students who are convicted of viola
tions will not - be permitted to operate
motor vehicles on the University
grounds for a period of 90 days after
the date of sentence by the civil au
thorities.
Recent flagrant violations of the traf
fic regulations have made it necessary
for the University to turn this matter
over to the county officials. While we
regret this action, we feel that this is the
only course open to the University.
Very truly yours,
A. E. ROTH, Comptroller.
