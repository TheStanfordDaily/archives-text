# BASEBALL FINALS BEGIN WEDNESDAY; TWO LEAGUES TIED
## 
### 
By registering a 5-to-3 victory over
Sigma Alpha Epsilon yesterday after
noon the Encina intramural baseball nine
won the privilege of meeting Beta Theta
Pi for the championship of League Two.
The three teams were tied with a per
centage of .750. Hal Smith, Encina out
fielder, was knocked unconscious and
badly shaken up in a head-on collision
with Keller of Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
during the fourth inning. He was car
ried from the field, and his place taken
by Lindbloom. Keller was unhurt and
finished the game.
The game was a nip-and-tuck affair,
with Sigma Alpha Epsilon holding the
lead the greater part of the time until
the fourth inning, when Encina took the
lead and held it until the end. In the
first frame Keller opened up with a
double to left, and a moment later scored
when Rodriguez dropped a pop fly. En
cina evened matters in their half of the
same stanza; Healy starting with a
single, stealing second and third, and
crossing the plate on Hubner's bingle.
In the third, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
again took the lead without the aid of a
hit, Summy reaching second on an error
and taking third and home on two suc
cessive passed balls. Encina's half of
the fourth frame won the ball game.
After Smith was hurt, he was called safe
at first and Lindbloom substituted for
him. The next man advanced Lind
bloom, and was safe 011 an error. Adams
cleared the sacks with a double to center,
but was out trying to stretch his hit into
a triple. Rodriguez and Rowland made
up the winning battery, with Gifford,
Strong and Draper working for Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.
The only remaining scheduled games
of the series are between Kappa Sigma
and El Capitan this afternoon for the
championship of League Four, and En
cina and Beta Theta Pi on Monday for
the honors in League Two. The post
season series will begin Wednesday. May
31. These games will be played on
either the freshman or varsity fields,
will consist of seven innings, and will
start at 4:20 p. m. The winner will be
picked on a percentage basis, each team
playing the other four.
On Wednesday, Phi Delta Theta will
meet the winner of the El Capitan-Kappa
Sigma game, and Sigma Chi will play
either Encina or Beta Theta Pi. All
these teams have been playing good ball
and under the extra stimulus of cham
pionship competition should turn out
games well worth watching. The post
season series will end June 9.

cleared the sacks with a double to center,
but was out trying to stretch his hit into
a triple. Rodriguez and Rowland made
up the winning battery, with Gifford,
Strong and Draper working for Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.
The only remaining scheduled games
of the series are between Kappa Sigma
and El Capitan this afternoon for the
championship of League Four, and En
cina and Beta Theta Pi on Monday for
the honors in League Two. The post
season series will begin Wednesday. May
31. These games will be played on
either the freshman or varsity fields,
will consist of seven innings, and will
start at 4:20 p. m. The winner will be
picked on a percentage basis, each team
playing the other four.
On Wednesday, Phi Delta Theta will
meet the winner of the El Capitan-Kappa
Sigma game, and Sigma Chi will play
either Encina or Beta Theta Pi. All
these teams have been playing good ball
and under the extra stimulus of cham
pionship competition should turn out
games well worth watching. The post
season series will end June 9.
By registering a 5-to-3 victory over
Sigma Alpha Epsilon yesterday after
noon the Encina intramural baseball nine
won the privilege of meeting Beta Theta
Pi for the championship of League Two.
The three teams were tied with a per
centage of .750. Hal Smith, Encina out
fielder, was knocked unconscious and
badly shaken up in a head-on collision
with Keller of Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
during the fourth inning. He was car
ried from the field, and his place taken
by Lindbloom. Keller was unhurt and
finished the game.
The game was a nip-and-tuck affair,
with Sigma Alpha Epsilon holding the
lead the greater part of the time until
the fourth inning, when Encina took the
lead and held it until the end. In the
first frame Keller opened up with a
double to left, and a moment later scored
when Rodriguez dropped a pop fly. En
cina evened matters in their half of the
same stanza; Healy starting with a
single, stealing second and third, and
crossing the plate on Hubner's bingle.
In the third, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
again took the lead without the aid of a
hit, Summy reaching second on an error
and taking third and home on two suc
cessive passed balls. Encina's half of
the fourth frame won the ball game.
After Smith was hurt, he was called safe
at first and Lindbloom substituted for
him. The next man advanced Lind
bloom, and was safe 011 an error. Adams
cleared the sacks with a double to center,
but was out trying to stretch his hit into
a triple. Rodriguez and Rowland made
up the winning battery, with Gifford,
Strong and Draper working for Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.
