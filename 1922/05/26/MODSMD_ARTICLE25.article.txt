Mr. C. A. Stone, local agent, South
ern Pacific, advises that in circulat
ing about the Campus interviewing
the student who might be interested
in the "Back East Excursion" round
trip rates, the impression seems to
prevail that these tickets bear a re
turn limit of three months from date
of sale. This was the case in former
years—but it is not so this year. Mr.
Stone wishes to state that these
round trip tickets bear a return limit
date of October 31st, regardless of
date of purchase. This should be of
interest to those laboring under the
impression that tickets carry but a
three months limit.
