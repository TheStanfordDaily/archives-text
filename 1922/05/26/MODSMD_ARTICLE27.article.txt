# Union and Sequoia To House Summer Students
## 
### 
University authorities have decided
to close Encina Hall for the summer
quarter, the new Union and Sequoia
being kept open to accommodate those
who stay for the summer curriculum
and for the newcomers. The dining
room at the Union will furnish eat
ing accommodations for the campus.
During the summer, several con
ventions are in prospect at Stanford,
and a portion of Encina will be used
to house the delegates.
