# PROFESSOR FERRIS TELLS OF TRIP TO LOWER CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Professor G. F. Ferris spoke to Zool
ogy Club at President Wilbur's home last
evening on "Cape Regions of Lower
California."
Professor Ferris made a trip.to Lower
California a few years ago for the pur
pose of collecting scale bugs, and in his
address he related incidents of that ex
pedition.
Stanford has a collection of scale bugs
second only to that in the National Mu
seum at Washington, which is the largest
in the world. Professor Ferris is largely
responsible for this complete set of
specimens.
After an informal discussion of zoo
logical problems, President Wilbur, who
has just returned from a trip to the
northern part of the state on the en
dowment campaign, gave a brief talk on
matters of general interest.
This was the last regular meeting of
the year. The club is planning a hike
for Sunday, June 4, to the Zoology Field
Station.
