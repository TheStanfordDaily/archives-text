## 
### 
Miss Alice Hoyt has been appointed
student secretary of the national V. W.
C. A. in the Pacific coast field to succeed
Miss Helen Solt. Miss Solt was forced
to resign on account of ill health.
Miss Hoyt graduated in 1909 from the
University of California and so is fa
miliar with the Pacific coast field. She
lias been a student secretary in the north
eastern field, with headquarters in New
York City, for the past two years.
Following the reorganization of the
student associations in the national Y.
W. C. A. at the Hot Springs conven
tion, the number of fields has been re
duced from eleven to six. That means
that the Pacific coast field, of which the
Stanford association is a part, includes
the Pacific coast from California to
Canada, Arizona, Nevada, and the Ha
waiian Islands with field headquarters in
San Francisco.
