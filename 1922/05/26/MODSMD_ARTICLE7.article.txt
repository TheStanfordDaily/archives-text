# BARRAGE OF LIGHT REPLACES CURTAIN FOR GRAND OPERA
## Director Gaetano Merola Is Preparing Stadium For for Four June Productions 
### 
A "curtain of fire" composed entirely
of lights which will take the place of the
regulation drop curtain. has been de
vised by Ray Coyle for use in the pro
duction of Gaetana Merola's four grand
opera sto be given in the Stanford sta
dium. With Goyle's system of lighting
effects it will be possible to conceal any
scenery in the background until it is re
quired in the unfolding of the story. At
the conclusion of an act or scene in the
operas, a barrage of footlights will serve
to screen the stage from the audience
while the sets are shifted. The stage of
the Harvard stadium is equipped with a
system of pipes through means of which
a curtain of steam replaces the usual
drop curtain.
The University technical departments
have been placed at the disposal of Me
rola and contracts have been placed for
three truckloads of electrical equipment.
"The size of the stage, which is 80 by
40 feet, offers production
far beyond those of a regular theater,"
Merola explained. "For instance, we do
not have to resort to property trees but
can use real ones."
Insuring the success of the operas by
the engagement of such singers as Gio
vanni Martinelli, acknowledged succes
sor to Caruso; Vicente Ballester, bari
tone of the Chicago Grand Opera Com
pany; Leon Rothier, leading bass of the
Metropolitan Grand Opera Company;
Ina Bourskaja, the sensational Russian
"Carmen," and Bianca Saroya, soprano
of the Boston Opera Company, Gaetano
Merola, director-in-chief of the produc
tions, is now hard at work on the prob
lem of bringing every part of the pro
ductions up to the musical standards
which he has established.
Indicative of the magnitude of the pro
ductions is the announcement that special
trains will be used to carry those who
are connected with the operas to and
from San Francisco. The personnel,
aside from the army of stage hands, in
cludes a ballet of 50 under the direction
of Xatale Carussio, the famous Italian
ballet master, a singing chorus of 150
men and women, and an orchestra of
110 pieces.
Every possible arrangement is being
made for the comfort of the public. Spe
cial excursion trains and rates will be
provided and railroad officials announce
that music lovers in the bay region will
find the productions to be almost as
accessible as if they were being staged
in the Civic Auditorium. Free parking
space will be provided for 10,000 auto
mobiles.
Figuring as beneficiaries of the per
formances will be the Endowment Fund,
the Fund for the Enlargement of the
Organ in the Memorial Church, Stan
ford Clinics in San Francisco, and the
Home for Convalescent Children on the
campus.
