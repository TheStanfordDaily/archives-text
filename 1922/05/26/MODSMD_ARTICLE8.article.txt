# ATHLETES OF WEST IMPRESS EAST AT HARVARD STADIUM
## 
### 
BOSTONrMASS., May 26. (United
Press). â€”Swarthy colored, sun-tinted
hands from the far west were waving
with hypnotic gestures in front of the
east as the greatest of America's col
lege athletes got ready for the first
day of the forty-sixth annual inter
collegiate championships at the Cam
bridge Stadium.
Pleased with the taste of last year's
championship, the Pacific Coast, in the
desire for another title, sent Califor
nia, last year's champions, and Stan
ford, two of the strongest of the many
star teams gathered here for the an
nual classic.
' "If California doesn't repeat, Stan
ford will. We'll finish first or second
either way," the California contingent
gloated and there was no strong re
buttal from the east.
Pennsylvania, Princeton, Cornell,
Harvard, Dartmouth, Penn State, and
Georgetown have strong combinations,
but the points will be split so many
ways that there seems little chance
to head off the well-balanced aggrega
tions from the coast.
Among all the Olympic, world and
national champions that will compete,
perhaps none will draw the attention
as "Tiny" Hartranft, the sensational
Stanford shot-putter, discus thrower
and sprinter. He is within inches of
the world's record in the shot and
within a few feet of the discus, and
although he carries 200 pounds, he can
do ten seconds in the century. He
is counted upon as the biggest indi
vidual point scorer of the meet.
Several world's records may be
broken and it is almost a certainty
that many intercollegiate marks will
be bettered.
Kirksey, Stanford; LeConey, Lafay
ette; and Lovejoy, Cornell, are con
sistent 9 4-5 men in the hundred yards,
and on the Harvard track, which is
about the fastest in the world, one of
the three may jump out into the Pad
dock class.
Larry Brown, Pennsylvania captain,
is going out for a record in the quar
ter and in the half. Allen Woodring,
Syracuse start and Olympic 200-meter
champion, might set a new mark in
the 220 yard dash, if he is in form.
Nothing like the present assemblage
of talent has even appeared in the
intercollegiates and tickets are in such
demand that a new attendance mark
may be set.
