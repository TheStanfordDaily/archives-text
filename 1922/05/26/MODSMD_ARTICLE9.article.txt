# FOUNDATION LAID FOR TRACK OVAL IN NEW STADIUM
## Problem of Hard Coal Cinder Troubles "Dad" Moulton and Builders of New Track 
### 
A foundation of crushed rock has
been laid as the first stage in the con
struction of the new track oval in the
stadium, and all materials with the ex
ception of cinders have arrived. Work
will start shortly on the first part of the
five-layer track bed.
The problem of getting the right kind
of cinders has been puzzling "Dad"
Moulton and Baker and Carpenter, con
struction engineers, for several months.
Samples have been received from Utah,
Colorado and San Francisco, and two
shipments have come from New York.
"Dad" Moulton does not wish to use the
soft coal cinders which can be obtained
011 the Pacific coast, and on the other
hand it has been difficult to get suitable
hard-coal cinders from the East partly
because the modern blow furnaces re
duce the coal to a fine ash. However,
the second sample from New York which
arrived here this morning will probably
prove satisfactory. At any rate a de
cision as to the cinders which will be
used will be made very soon, since it is
planned to have the track finished by the
day of the Big Game next fall. Cinders
from the East will be packed in sacks
and shipped as ballast, about three
months being required for their delivery.
A red cement curbing is being put in
on each side of the oval and at present
this work is approximately 40 per cent
completed. The new track will be 20 feet
wide on the straightaways and 15 on the
bends. A drainage system has been in
stalled around the oval and will help to
prevent the soggy condition of the track
in the rainy months. Eight-inch iron
stone pipes have been put in, and water
will be carried to drain ditches at the
sides of the track leading to a slump
at the end of the 220 straightaway.
Pumps will not be installed until the ne
cessity for them is demonstrated. »
During the latter part of next week
the first layer of redwood shavings will
be laid. Correspondence with many
mills throughout the East failed to lo
cate the desired shavings, since the
blower system so widely employed burns
them up. However, several weeks ago
Mr. Baker of Baker and Carpenter, con
struction engineers for the stadium,
found a mill in Spring Valley which had
a fifteen-year pile of shavings, due to
the fact that the mill was within town
limits and could not use the blower
methods. Ten carloads of these shavings
were obtained at no cost except that of
transportation.
A saving of 80 per cent was made in
procuring an excellent quality of clay
from Palo Alto instead of shipping the
material from a large brick company's
clay bank which was a considerable dis
tance from here. The exact quality of
clay wanted by "Dad" Moulton was dis
covered being excavated for a cellar in
Palo Alto. Trucks have been hauling
this clay to the stadium, and about 400
cubic yards will be used on the track.

Palo Alto. Trucks have been hauling
this clay to the stadium, and about 400
cubic yards will be used on the track.
A foundation of crushed rock has
been laid as the first stage in the con
struction of the new track oval in the
stadium, and all materials with the ex
ception of cinders have arrived. Work
will start shortly on the first part of the
five-layer track bed.
The problem of getting the right kind
of cinders has been puzzling "Dad"
Moulton and Baker and Carpenter, con
struction engineers, for several months.
Samples have been received from Utah,
Colorado and San Francisco, and two
shipments have come from New York.
"Dad" Moulton does not wish to use the
soft coal cinders which can be obtained
011 the Pacific coast, and on the other
hand it has been difficult to get suitable
hard-coal cinders from the East partly
because the modern blow furnaces re
duce the coal to a fine ash. However,
the second sample from New York which
arrived here this morning will probably
prove satisfactory. At any rate a de
cision as to the cinders which will be
used will be made very soon, since it is
planned to have the track finished by the
day of the Big Game next fall. Cinders
from the East will be packed in sacks
and shipped as ballast, about three
months being required for their delivery.
A red cement curbing is being put in
on each side of the oval and at present
this work is approximately 40 per cent
completed. The new track will be 20 feet
wide on the straightaways and 15 on the
bends. A drainage system has been in
stalled around the oval and will help to
prevent the soggy condition of the track
in the rainy months. Eight-inch iron
stone pipes have been put in, and water
will be carried to drain ditches at the
sides of the track leading to a slump
at the end of the 220 straightaway.
Pumps will not be installed until the ne
cessity for them is demonstrated. »
During the latter part of next week
the first layer of redwood shavings will
be laid. Correspondence with many
mills throughout the East failed to lo
cate the desired shavings, since the
blower system so widely employed burns
them up. However, several weeks ago
Mr. Baker of Baker and Carpenter, con
struction engineers for the stadium,
found a mill in Spring Valley which had
a fifteen-year pile of shavings, due to
the fact that the mill was within town
limits and could not use the blower
methods. Ten carloads of these shavings
were obtained at no cost except that of
transportation.
A saving of 80 per cent was made in
procuring an excellent quality of clay
from Palo Alto instead of shipping the
material from a large brick company's
clay bank which was a considerable dis
tance from here. The exact quality of
clay wanted by "Dad" Moulton was dis
covered being excavated for a cellar in
Palo Alto. Trucks have been hauling
this clay to the stadium, and about 400
cubic yards will be used on the track.
