lying when defeat seemed certain, El
Capitan pulled the game out of the fire
and piled up a two-run lead in the final
inning, only to have Kappa Sigma tic
the score in the same session, and in an
extra inning put over the winning run.
Kappa Sigma took a three-run advan
tage in the first time at bat, when Aid
hit safely, Condit walked, and Shipke
singled, to score a moment later on a
passed ball. In the next inning, White,
of El Capitan poled a triple into left
field, and came in on Reichmuth's sac
rifice fly to Middleton. El Capitan added
another in the fourth with the aid of
three consecutive singles and an error;
and Kappa Sigma, due largely to Spires'
three-bagger, managed to annex three
more tallies before the fatal seventh.
At the short end of the 6 to 2 score.
El Capitan assaulted Rogers' offerings
for six runs during this inning. The
Kappa Sigma team eased up and were
unable to pull together in time to stop
the volley of hard-hit ground balls di
rected at them by El Capitan batsmen
With the bases full, due to errors, Was
sum sent a three-bagger over the left
fielder's hcadj and scored at once on an
infield out. El Capitan again filled the
bags, and Anglim rose to the occasion
with a double which sent two men over
the plate. This ended El Capitan's run
getting.
In the last of the seventh, the first
man up for Kappa Sigma walked. Aid
came through with a double, scoring
him. Then Eskew grounded to the
shortstop, who threw wide to first base.
In making the catch Moore was forced
to stand on the base line, where Eskew
collided with him, and the two men fell
together. During the excitement Aid
scored all the way from second, and the
count was tied.
El Capitan was retired in order in the
first of the eighth. Lindersmith, how
ever, walked the first three Kappa Sigma
men who faced him, and was retired in
favor of Wassutn. Powell then sent a
hot grounder to the El Capitan short
stop, whose throw was too slow to keep
Conover from making the winning tally.'
Rogers and Spires made up the Kappa
Sigma battery, with Lindersmith, Was
sum, and Feliren working for El Cap
itan.
This game left only one league with
the championship still undecided, and

The tie for first place in League Four
was broken Friday afternoon when El
Capitan lost a heart-breaking contest to
Kappa Sigma by a score of 9 to 8. Ral
lying when defeat seemed certain, El
Capitan pulled the game out of the fire
and piled up a two-run lead in the final
inning, only to have Kappa Sigma tic
the score in the same session, and in an
extra inning put over the winning run.
Kappa Sigma took a three-run advan
tage in the first time at bat, when Aid
hit safely, Condit walked, and Shipke
singled, to score a moment later on a
passed ball. In the next inning, White,
of El Capitan poled a triple into left
field, and came in on Reichmuth's sac
rifice fly to Middleton. El Capitan added
another in the fourth with the aid of
three consecutive singles and an error;
and Kappa Sigma, due largely to Spires'
three-bagger, managed to annex three
more tallies before the fatal seventh.
At the short end of the 6 to 2 score.
El Capitan assaulted Rogers' offerings
for six runs during this inning. The
Kappa Sigma team eased up and were
unable to pull together in time to stop
the volley of hard-hit ground balls di
rected at them by El Capitan batsmen
With the bases full, due to errors, Was
sum sent a three-bagger over the left
fielder's hcadj and scored at once on an
infield out. El Capitan again filled the
bags, and Anglim rose to the occasion
with a double which sent two men over
the plate. This ended El Capitan's run
getting.
In the last of the seventh, the first
man up for Kappa Sigma walked. Aid
came through with a double, scoring
him. Then Eskew grounded to the
shortstop, who threw wide to first base.
In making the catch Moore was forced
to stand on the base line, where Eskew
collided with him, and the two men fell
together. During the excitement Aid
scored all the way from second, and the
count was tied.
El Capitan was retired in order in the
first of the eighth. Lindersmith, how
ever, walked the first three Kappa Sigma
men who faced him, and was retired in
favor of Wassutn. Powell then sent a
hot grounder to the El Capitan short
stop, whose throw was too slow to keep
Conover from making the winning tally.'
Rogers and Spires made up the Kappa
Sigma battery, with Lindersmith, Was
sum, and Feliren working for El Cap
itan.
This game left only one league with
the championship still undecided, and
