# STANFORD PLACES THIRD IN I.C.4 A. TRACK ME
## HARTRANFT TAKES 10 OF 26 1-2 POINTS CARDS MAKE 
### 
After a two days' battle on the cinder
path in the I. C. A. A. A. A. champion
ships at Harvard, the East versus West
strife was declared a draw.
Walt Christie is a happy man today,
for his track and field men stood him
in good stead, and, with 40 l / 2 points, re
tained for another year the big trophy
emblematic of the championship of the
United States. Stanford's ten-man team
eased into third place, with points.
As far as the point column is con
cerned, the two western teams had much
the better of the argument, but there
their superiority stopped. Of the fifteen
first places, eleven of them went to east
ern athletes, who made exceptional
marks in all except the 440 yard dash.
The Princeton Tiger, slighted almost
universally in predictions of the meet,
rose up in protest at the heralded "su
periority of western athletes" and
fought its way into second place, with
31 points. The first eight teams stood
as follows: California, 40y 2 \ Prince
ton, 31; Stanford, 26y 2 \ Cornell, 21 l / 2 \
Pennsylvania, 16; Harvard, 14; Penn
State, 11; Lafayette, 10.
Three intercollegiate records fell be
fore the onslaught of the pick of the
nation's cinder path stars. LeConey of
Lafayette, improved immensely since his
defeat by Kirksey last year, clipped 1-10
of a second from the mark in the 100-
yard dash. Merchant shattered the
hammer throw record on Friday with
a heave of 171 feet 2 inches. Brown of
Dartmouth completed the record-break
ing by jumping 6 feet 4 inches in the
high jump.
Two things dealt the death blow to
Stanford's chances on Friday afternoon,
for the meet was practically decided by
the results of the preliminaries. Wil
liamson. figured as a sure point winner,
entered a fast heat in the 440, and was
shut out by McDonald of California,
Stevenson of Princeton, and Ray of
Rutger's in 50 seconds fiat, balk, in
