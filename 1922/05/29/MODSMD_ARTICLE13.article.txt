# STANFORD PLACES THIRD IN I.C.4 A. TRACK ME
## HARTRANFT TAKES 10 OF 26 1-2 POINTS CARDS MAKE 
### 
After a two days' battle on the cinder
path in the I. C. A. A. A. A. champion
ships at Harvard, the East versus West
strife was declared a draw.
Walt Christie is a happy man today,
for his track and field men stood him
in good stead, and, with 40 l / 2 points, re
tained for another year the big trophy
emblematic of the championship of the
United States. Stanford's ten-man team
eased into third place, with points.
As far as the point column is con
cerned, the two western teams had much
the better of the argument, but there
their superiority stopped. Of the fifteen
first places, eleven of them went to east
ern athletes, who made exceptional
marks in all except the 440 yard dash.
The Princeton Tiger, slighted almost
universally in predictions of the meet,
rose up in protest at the heralded "su
periority of western athletes" and
fought its way into second place, with
31 points. The first eight teams stood
as follows: California, 40y 2 \ Prince
ton, 31; Stanford, 26y 2 \ Cornell, 21 l / 2 \
Pennsylvania, 16; Harvard, 14; Penn
State, 11; Lafayette, 10.
Three intercollegiate records fell be
fore the onslaught of the pick of the
nation's cinder path stars. LeConey of
Lafayette, improved immensely since his
defeat by Kirksey last year, clipped 1-10
of a second from the mark in the 100-
yard dash. Merchant shattered the
hammer throw record on Friday with
a heave of 171 feet 2 inches. Brown of
Dartmouth completed the record-break
ing by jumping 6 feet 4 inches in the
high jump.
Two things dealt the death blow to
Stanford's chances on Friday afternoon,
for the meet was practically decided by
the results of the preliminaries. Wil
liamson. figured as a sure point winner,
entered a fast heat in the 440, and was
shut out by McDonald of California,
Stevenson of Princeton, and Ray of
Rutger's in 50 seconds fiat, balk, in
his first race, hit the third hurdle and
fell down.
"Tiny" Hartranft shared the honors
with LeConey and Merchant. The
blond giant was in first-class condition,
and had little difficulty in winning both
the sh'ot and discus.
Kirksey and Sudden, the Cardinal
sprint team, found too many high-cal
iber dash men. Kirksey was shut out iti
the semi-finals of the 100, but Sudden
placed fourth in the finals. The sopho
more came back with a vengeance in the
220, taking second, with Kirksey fourth'.
Hayes made three points in the 220-
yard low hurdles, won by Taylor of
Princeton in :23 9-10, and Black had to
be content with fourth in the pole vault.
Manner, despite his good showing in
practice, was beaten by both Bronder of
Pennsylvania and Sorrenti of the Bruins
in the javelin.
It was a bad day for the title holders.
LeConey displaced Kirksey and Wood
ring in the sprints; Driscoll of Boston
College beat Hendrixson in the 440;
Muller lost out to Brown in the high
jump. Norris defended his half of the
pole vault championship successfully,
winning the event at 12 feet 9 inches.
The trip across the continent undoubt
edly had a bad effect on the track ath
letes of both Stanford and California.
The Bruins' strength lay in the field
events, and these entries were less af
fected by the trip. Williamson, on the
other hand, must have plenty of work,
and the confinement on the train slowed
him up.
