# SCHOLARSHIP HONOR STUDENTS ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
The Scholarship Committee of the
Faculty has selected for recommendation
to the Academic Council the students to
be awarded the Lower Division honors
and Stanford Scholarships.
There arc thirty Stanford Scholars
selected each spring quarter from the
students who will be seniors during the
following year. The recipients of this
honor are distributed among five groups
of allied departments in t,he University,
approximately, according to registration
in those groups. Formerly, Stanford
Scholars, who numbered twenty instead
of thirty as now, were chosen from the
undergraduate body as a whole, but this
year will have been selected largely
from the incoming senior class. No
person is eligible for election unless he
has a grade point average of at least
2.40.
The Lower Division honors have been
established this year. The list of stu
dents winning this new undergraduate
scholarship distinction this year is com
posed approximately of the upper tenth
of those Lower Division students who
had at least seventy-two units credit out
of the one hundred and eighty required
for graduation at the beginning of the
winter and spring quarters. On ac
count of the fact that the University
did not adopt this system of honors un
til the winter quarter, those who left
the Lower Division at the end of the
autumn quarter were not included.
Hereafter such students will be taken
into account.
The recipients of these undergraduate
honors will appear in the Commencement
program, as will also those who grad
uate with distinction and with great
distinction. The graduation honors,
however, will not be announced until
commencement time.
