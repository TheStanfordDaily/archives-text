# Special Transportation Facilities To Be Given East Bay Opera Patrons
## 
### 
Through special transportation and
parking arrangements, the music festival
to be held in the Stanford Stadium in
June, opening with "I' Pagliacca" on
Saturday night, will be placed within
the reach of every music lover in the
Fast Bay district. Special trains, leaving
San Francisco every few minutes, begin
ning at 6:45 in the evening, will be run
directly to the Stadium entrance. Com
muters may attend the performances and
return to their homes without missing
their customary boat, as the operas will
be over by 10:45, and trains returning
from the Stadium at 11:03 and 11:08
p. m. will arrive in San Francisco by 12
o'clock.
Many opera parties are being formed
for the entire season. Reports from the
various points from which the tickets
are being sold indicate a large attend
ance.
There will also be parking space
around the Stadium to accommodate
10,000 machines; and the system which
has been devised will greatly expedite
their arrival and departure. This park
ing space will be properly policed to pro
tect the machines and valuables of the
opera patrons.
