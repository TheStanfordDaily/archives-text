# MEMORIAL DAY
## 
### 
We have a holiday tomorrow. What for? The
day is listed officially iti the calendar of yearly
events as Memorial Day. How far is the spirit to
be observed by us 1f we were in a small town we
would have the town brass band out and the old men
of the G. A. R. would march down the street tc> the
cemetery and place flowers on the G. A. R. plot
while someone blew "taps" on the bugle or cornet.
If we were at an army post we would have to take
part in a parade and put on a battalion or regimental
review. If we were kids again we would probably
take a bamboo and hike away to the river for a swim
and a chance catch of some bass or catfish.

We are not in any of the classes btit singularly
apart from all of them. We do not have the services
that mark the Memorial Day ceremonies in any other
community although we have among us men and
women with a more vital interest in what the day
stands for than in most places. There are none of
us here but has had some sort of reaction in the past
few years since the time of the great war, in addition
to sentiments that may have existed previous to
1017. While the times of four years ago seem to he
fast drifting into oblivion we often think of them
and to many of us comes a feeling of more than
ordinary sadness. Perhaps we lost some dear friend
while in the service, perhaps a brother or a father.

We will have no formal exercises to commemorate
the day. All of us will he left to our own. This is
no reason why we should sit and mope about any
loss that has befallen us. That would not be in
keeping with the age. We do not now parade our
sorrow as was the custom in days gone by. To the
contrary, this is a day for rejoicing in what the
sacrifices of those who gave their all have brought
to us. Let us make the most of the day and in doing
so give a thought, perhaps a prayer, flbr those for
whom the day is named. In doing so we will have
done the things which are included in the spirit of
the occasion without ostentation or ceremony, pav
ing our tribute without any show or false pretense
to make us feel guilty of any hypocrisy.
