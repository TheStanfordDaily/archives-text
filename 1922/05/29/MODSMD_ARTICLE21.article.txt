# SOMETHING STARTED

With the turning over of the enforcement of speed
and traffic regulation on the campus to the civil au
thorities of the country there should be a diminution
of the number of accidents on the campus. The offi
cers in charge of the county traffic rules, being ex
perts in their line, ought to make it hot for student
and other campus dwellers who insist on making the
going dangerous for the passerby and the other
motorist.
The Comptroller's Office has had to come to asking
the aid of the outside officers on account of the abso
lute lack of any cooperation from the members of
the student body in helping to enforce the rules
regarding operation of motor vehilces on the campus.
The matter of suspension from driving on the campus
will act as a deterrent to careless driving. Losing the
use of one's machine is considerably worse than pay
ing a fine of a few dollars â€”at least to the average
man.
To our mind this is the best thing that the Uni
versity could do, and we look to see a material cut in
the mean speed average on the campus or a rushing
business for the Palo Alto bastile.
