Henry Mack, In Friday Caboost
The contributors have been busy again. Here are
some hot from the Corona of Abie Mazda. His "Con
fession of a Corrector" last week were ill-advised, so it
seems. The correctors are taking it out on Friday.
Shows you dear readers what sacrifices we Cabbages
make for you sometimes.

Abie's first one is a ballad, entitled: "My Father was
a Confederate soldier but he wore a Union suit,"
* m *
After a deep bow, Abie hit the keys for the following:
It's a wise policeman who knows his own beat.
» * *
Abie Mazda's next one is imported direct from May
field. It's a darn good joke ... he says so himself.
* m m
Furious Female —I'm going to report you. What's
your number?
Mayfield Conductor —Main 1616. Call any time after
seven.
* * *
Mazda concludes with one that we suspect was crib
bed. He could never have read the original of this one:
• • •
Women have been smoking for some time. Here it
says that "And Itebekka lifted up her eyes, and when
she saw Isacc, she lighted off' a Camel."
♦ * * •
With which we bow Abie out and ourselves in. But
in passing, as the dice player remarked, rolling a seven,
we want to say that Abie has become a regular contri
butor to Friday's caboose. Any more applicants wi ! l
be admitted in order of applications.

Our Thumbnail Editorial
A few years ago a man in a straw hat appearing on
the Farm would have been about as much of a success
as a bird dog in an ostrich farm. Now he is envied by
all the Frosh, decried by all the Sophomores, mimiced
by the Juniors, and pitied by the Seniors. We don't
like to see straw hats. Besides, we never could get one
to fit.

Here it is! the biggest expose since the L. A. bathing
parade! The story of Cleopatra, entitled "Save the Sur
face and you Save All, or A Skin You Love to Touch."
—by Abie Mazda.
Cleo was disgusted. Anyone could have seen that by
one glance into her private suite. She flung herself
onto an Ivory couch and wept.
Cleo was injured. Ivan Bangoff, the handsomest
prince in all the Nile country (he said so himself) had
left the palace in a rage and a fafet chariot not an hour
ago. And why? Recollection of the reason made Cleo
hot. Her blood boiled. She knew it was boiling, be
cause she was smoking.
As Cleo told her lady ill waiting, "When Ivan came
I hoped to win him for my husband. And I failed. . . .
now he has gone off without me . . . how my people will
laugh! And all because I never knew how to love."
From this it may deduced that Cleo was not born that
way, and that it was some little time after her cradle
day before she learned to.

After the affair with Ivan Bangoff, Cleo retired more
and more from her local suitors, who, as the Keeper
of the Royal Canoe remarked, knew a good thing when
they saw it; she was busy every day reading some book
that she never allowed out of her possession.
One day an announcement was made that threw the
court into an uproar. Word was received mat Marcus
Antony, Conqueror of the East and West, including
Alaska and Porto Rico (Great Britain rights reserved)
was out on another hunting expedition, and would stop
at Cleo's flat for a time. . . and he expected it to be
a good time.

Chapter Two
Cleo's court was busy for days; the ladies were re
modeling Cleo's old dresses, and it is rumored chat many
poor women clothed themselves in the trimmings. The
cooks wore busy feeding up her pet asps; the Keeper
of the Royal Canoe was busy with his boat for weeks;
in short as the Keeper of the Royal Treasury brightly
remarked, "Tony is due for a flop when he lamps our
head Lulu. Wonder where she copped the class.'
But, Cleo, though the whole court was wondering, held
her secret fast and her pace faster.
* * *
Anthony was received with ihe usual profound ex
pression of surprise. Cleo kept him waiting in the lobby
the accustomed half-hour, and then came down in the
elevator as if she didn't know that Tony was parked
on the best sofa. As she came out of the elevator the
court gasped. So did Antony. Cleo was admittedly a
K. O. she had, as was evident to even the most care
less observers, the skin you love to touch. She had
bobbed her hair, and as is usual, it had improved her
looks immensely. In fact, one of the cattier women
of the court remarked that "she would never have
known her if she hadn't worn the pet asp around her
neck.
Tony was stunned. He rose with alacrity and several
remarks that were quite new to the east but which
were never the less appreciated. One of them that the
Keeper of the Royal Asps remembered was, "Sweet
Daddy!"
