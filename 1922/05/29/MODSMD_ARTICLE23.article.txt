RAILROAD WAGES CUT
The United States Railroad Labor
Board has made public the exp&cted
cut in the wages of some 400,000 main
tenance of way employees and un
skilled shop laborers. The cut aver
ages 13.2 per cent of present wages for
these classes and is expected to re
duce the railroad payrolls about $48,-
000,000i annually. Only the six mem
bers of the Board representing the and
the railroad employers signed the deci
sion, the three members representing
the laborers submitted a dissenting
opinion. They claim that the decision
reduces wages "below the minimum
standard of subsistence."
It is anticipated that reductions will
be made for other classes of railroad
employees, thus putting wages in this
field back on a pre-war basis. How
ever, it should be noticed that the
wages of the five classes which oper
ate the trains are not to be touched,
as the wages of the conductors, engi
neers, trainmen, firemen, and switch
men are not under consideration. The
motive is clear, but is not as admirable
as lucid.
Railroad executives are said "to
view the decision as a big step to nor
mal conditions." President Harding
in a letter to Secretary Hoover com
mends the manner in which the un
employment crisis has been weathered,
and points out that strikes are the
hindrance to a more complete recov
ery. Whether the decision of the Rail
road Labor Board is going to avoid a
railroad strike by leaving the actual
"operators" wages as they are, re
mains to be seen.
CONCESSIONS MADE BY SOVIETS
Russia begins to realize that she
must not rely on Conferences to ex
tract her from her unhappy predica
ment. At least such seems to be the
interpretation of her recent moves to
fulfill requirements laid down as con
ditions precedent to recognition. Those
outlined by the United States are re
ceiving consideration, trade in farm
instruments has been denationalized,
and attempts are also being made to
stabilize the rouble and give it some
value by establishing a 10,000 to one
ratio between the depreciated currency
and future issues.
