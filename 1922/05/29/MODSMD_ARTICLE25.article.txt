## 
### 
Final plans for Women's Sports Day
next Saturday have been completed by
Carey Bailard, '22, field manager of the
events. The interclass swimming meet
will begin at 2 o'clock in the afternoon
and will be run off in an hour and a
half. The finals in tennis and the arch
ery shoot will commence at 3 :30.
In the evening a supper, to which all
women in the University are invited,
will be held under the oaks back of Ro
ble gymnasium. At this time all ath
letic awards will be made by the Wo
men's Athletic Association. Several
sweaters will be given to the women
who # have the largest number of points
according to the new point system re
cently adopted by W. A. A. Block "S"
letters and numerals will also be given
to women who have won them by play
ing on class teams in both class and in
tercollegiate teams.
The three silver cups which W. A. A.
is awarding to the highest point winner
in the swimming meet, the University
tennis champion, and the highest scorer
in archery will be presented at this sup
per.
This schedule, which is run in the
afternoon, takes the place of the former
all-day Field Day. On account of the
fact that the Women's Spring Pageant
took time from the sports at the begin
ning of the quarter, the program of
events is shorter than it has been in
former vears.
