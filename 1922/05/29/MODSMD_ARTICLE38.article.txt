# MARE ISLAND NINE WINS FROM VARSITY BY SCORE OF 3-0
## 
### 
Disarmament is evidently not a part
of the Marines' program just yet. Their
baseball team from Mare Island came
down to the campus Saturday afternoon
and loosened up the big guns by winning
from the varsity, 3-0, in the first of the
spring practice games which are getting
Seay's men in shape for the summer trip
to Honolulu.
Five hits off Nef at opportune times,
along with three errors by the varsity,
accounted for the Sea Dog scores. Only
four of the men who played in the Cal
ifornia series were in the Cardinal line
up Saturday, so that full strength was
not available. Nef did the hurling for
the home talent. Deffebach took Peavy's
place at second, while Parker moved
from the outtield to first in Woodward's
absence., Smurr held down third, and
Holston, who is slated to take the sum
mer trip, caught the whole game. Coul
thrust played in right, and Maillot,
Carver, and Wayland were back atttheir
old posts.
A double, two errors, and a balk sup
plied the Marines' first marker in the
fourth frame. Three hits in a row, one
of them a double, brought across the
second run in the seventh, and the third
and last tally was scored in the ninth
on a walk, two errors, and a steal of
home.
The varsity batters did not connect
with Austin's delivery until the fifth,
when Wayland got a single. He was
forced at second by Coulthrust. In the
next inning Holston and Deffebach both
got singles, but with no results in the
way of runs. Nef nicked out a safety
in the eighth with two downs, but got no
farther.
