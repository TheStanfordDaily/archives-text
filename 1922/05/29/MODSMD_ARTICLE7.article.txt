# BREAKERS HOLD LEAD IN INTRAMURAL TRACK
## 
### 
Breakers Club leads in the intramural
track meet which is to be completed this
week, making thus far a total of 17,880
points in six events. Tlieta Chi stands
second with 17,294 tallies and El Toro
third with 16,777 tallies to their credit.
Competition between these three organ
izations has been keen throughout the
entire meet, a large number of men en
tering every event. It will not be cer
tain till a careful check is made just
who will carry off the honors. Sigma
Nu, Theta Xi, and Sequoia rank in the
order given, all making well over S,(XX)
points. Twenty-eight organizations are
entered in the meet. Points are counted
upon the basis of the world's record
and any man equaling this record scores
1,000 points. The marks made by the
best ten men in each event were counted
toward their group.
The finals of the 100-yard dash will
be held Wednesday at 4:30. It was
hoped that the meet could be completed
today, but many of the men who
reached the finals are not on the campus.
Coach Botsford is eager to have as many
of the men enter as possible, so the event
was postponed until Wednesday.
Three plaques will be given as prizes.
One will be awarded to the winner of
the entire meet. The victor in the relay
will be awarded the second, and the man
who wins the 100-yard dash will receive
the third.
Jim Arthur, El Toro, is the highest
individual point winner to date, with
2,485 counts. Colgan, Delta Tau Delta,
is second with 2,423; Allen, Delta Chi,
third, with 2,344.
Finals in the broad jump, shot put,
and half mile will not be held. There
is not sufficient time to hold these events,
and since the greatest interest seemed to
be in the 100 yards, that is the only final
that will be run off.
