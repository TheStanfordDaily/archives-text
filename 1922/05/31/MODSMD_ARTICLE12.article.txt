# Quad Nominees Named; Others Come In Slowly
## 
### 
At noon today but one thing was lack
ing in the preliminaries for the Quad
election, June 7, and that thing was
candidates.
The fact that the box was placed in
front of the Romanic Language Build
ing to receive nominations did no 1 seem
to worry anyone—everyone passed it by
without so much as a passing comment.
The lack of candidates may indicate
one of two things—either the coming
election is to be marked by the same
lack of interest which has characterized
most of the recent elections or there
will be a large crop of "dark horses"
nominated at the last minute.
The fact that fifteen student body of
fices in addition to class offices are to

be filled, together with the early inter
est manifested, seems to indicate that
the latter view is the correct one.
The student body offices to be filled
include president, vice-president, secre
tary, and yell leader. Four class repre
sentatives on the Executive Committee,
five members on the Men's Council, and
a student representative for the Board
of Athletic Control are to be chosen.
The box will be placed in front of thi*
Romanic Language Building tomorrow,
Friday, and Monday between the hours
of 8 and 4 to receive nominations.
Nominations will close Monday at 4
o'clock and candidates for office will
have to resort to a "write in" voto if
their names have not been submitted by
that time.
Nominations today were limited to
minor class officers with two nominees
for student body offices and prelimin
ary nominations for editor and man
ager of the 1924 Quad. The nominees
are as follows: for secretary of the
class of 1925, Richard Jenkins; for
sophomore representative on the Exe
cutive Committee; Gurdon Steele, for
Men's Council, Dudley DeGroot, for
member of the Board of Athletic Con
trol, R. W. Faville. For Quad Editor,
Carl Shoup, Hal Rorke, Dan Gage,
Bob Edwards, Matthew Tobriner; for
Quad manager, Charles P. White, Wil
liam G. Lee, Neal Granger, and Walter
Levinson. Candidates for manager of
the Quad were selected on a point
bases. The leading candidate, Charles
White had nearly as many points as
the other three candidates.
