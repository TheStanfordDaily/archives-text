# POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS
## 
### 
Names of the men and women who will run for
the offices, student body and class, are beginning to
come in now. Tomorrow and Friday there will he
increased lists printed, giving the names of those who
are desired to he leaders in tl»e student administration
around the campus. The nominations will close Mon
day at noon.
1 o get the best results there should he a large num
ber of names put forward at once. It will he to the
advantage of the candidates if their names are put
til> early in the week because they will he better known
to the voters than the men who are advanced at the
last.
.The men who have some sort of organizations be
hind them will probably be put forward at the last
minute. They can afford this with the concerted
effort that will be behind them. This political cam
paigning is a good thing in a way because it brings
out a rivalry that would never come of its own ac
cord. It is unfortunate that so little interest exists
an most of the offices, but such being the case, there
has to be organization to bring out men who will
qualify for the job.
The only trouble lies in the fact that most of
the organizations follow the old national idea of ad
vancing men more for their party affiliation (here it
is group or social) than for real ability. If it could
be that men would be considered for what they are
rather than for what they belong to, then the politi
cal clubs would be a blessing and a spirit of rivalry
would be fostered that would bring out the men and
■women on the campus to take strong sides for one
or the other candidate.
The one thing to keep in mind now is, however, to
take an active part in helping to elect some candidate
to every office that you can get a vote for. If the
men and women are going to serve you for a year
they ought to be elected bv a big majority of the
student vote so that they know they are representing
the whole of the electoral body when they make a
decision. They can't act with confidence unless they
have this knowledge of support.
