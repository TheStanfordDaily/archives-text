# THE 						LAST LAP
## 
### 
Now that the last holiday is over we have only
a matter of seven more academic days before the
final examinations. This is a small stretch of time
to make up the slips that we have allowed to pile up
through the quarter, hut a great deal of good can be
accomplished if we take a hitch and work hard for the
last few days.
As is the usual case there are many of us that have
let reports, maps, outside lessons, and term papers go
until the last, when a few minutes only will be left
to make it up in. This crowds an awful lot into the
last few days, and there will not be enough time left.
This is always the way of the ones who wait until the
last minute and some of those who are not quite as
lucky as they had thought to be will shuffle out for
a year or maybe for good.
Tt gets to be an old line, the constant reminders
that the end of the race is only a few days off, and
many will not take heed. But a thought to the week
after next and a little extra effort for the time be
tween now and then will make a lot happier report to
take home at the end. Get going now and the end
will not hit so hard.

ALL MEMBERS of the Daily Palo Alto staff
will meet tomorrow in the Press Building at 1 :15 to
elect the editor-in-chief for next year. One-third of
the votes cast will be required to nominate a candi
date for student body election. In case but one can
didate receives that number of votes, he shall be de
clared elected without further balloting. Candidates'
names will be received bv the present editor-in-chief
until the vote is taken.
