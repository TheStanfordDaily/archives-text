THOUGHT-WAVE
(By Launcelot Lump)
Washout Dave was a practical slave
To ideas that studes should never behave;
He played his pranks on professors and cranks,
And thought his due was grateful thanks
For being live wire enough to show fire
And keep our spirits from sinking in mire.
Now don't mind Dave or his kind,
Although at times he's rather a grind.
1 don't fall for his simple stall
Of song—or bawl —as walks the hall
He makes the sound —which resembles a hound —
To let us know that Dave is around.
I can stay cool while Dave plays the fool
Trying to be a big man in the school,
His constant roar would be only a bore.
Except that he always makes me sore,
With the massage greeting he uses on meeting
Friends who have lately finished eating.

Dave genially paws on all with his claws
Like "one of the fellows"—slaps at their jaws—
He always bats at my tenderest slats
Tries to make friends by numerous pats
I shall plant in clover or food to Rover
That genial sap who paws me over.

The dater (over the phone) — and as he has an
automobile.
The Datee (ditto) —I'd love to come! What's his
name?
Scene 2—(Room in same fraternity house).
The Dater (assuredly)—l thing she's glad of the

Second Act
Scene I—Front1 —Front parlor. Sorority.)
The Dated (nervously)—Eh—Uh—is this Miss Lade?

the week-end. So I just came over, you know, to —
to —ah — You're going to that dance with me to
night, you know.
The Datee (glassily)—Yes, when do you think you
are coming over?
Scene 2 —(dance floor).
The Datee (to herself) —I'll have flat feet if he parks
on them much longer. He'd probably fall down if lie
didn't though.
The Dated (to himself) —She's as easy to talk to as
the Sphinx. Maybe her father was a head waiter,
(aloud) Isn't this music good, though.
The Datee (ditto) —Oh, yes.
Last Act
Scene I—(back1 —(back to the house).
The Dated —and if you ever get me hooked up witii
another highbrow dumbbell like she was, you buzzard,
you can begin choosing your flowers.
The Dater —Bull! Didn't I do you a favor? Didn't
you want a date? Didn't you get one?
Scene 2 —(Same front parlor, sorority style).
The Datee —You might at least think of my feel
ings next time you get one of our footloose brothers on
my trail!
The Dater —But, Dorothy. I really thought he was
a good dancer. And how did I know his automobile
was mortgaged?
—Conducted by Poosh.
