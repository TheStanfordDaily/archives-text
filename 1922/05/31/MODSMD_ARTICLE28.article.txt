# Largest Singing Chorus In State Will be one of Stadium Opera Features
## 
### 
When the lights flash on the first
scene of "I' Pagliaeca," which opens the
first annual Stanford Stadium Musical
Festival, Saturday evening, the greatest
singing chorus ever assembled in Cali
fornia will be heard. For the past three
months, 150 men and women have been
rehearsing steadily. In the selection of
voices for the chorus, Gaetano Meroli
has made use of professional talent
available, and at the same time has ac
cepted the best voices from classes
placed at his disposal by music teachers
in various parts of the state.
At the same time as the rehearsal cf
the chorus, 110 picked musicians, under
the personal direction of Merola, have
been going over the different musical
scores; while Nattqle Carossio, Russian
dancing master, has been conducting re
hearsals for her ballet of fifty on the
shores of the Pacific near the Cliff
House in San Francisco.
Much interest is being shown over
the coming open-air operas, as is evi
dent by the heavy sale of tickets espe
cially in San Francisco. Parties are be
ing formed for the entire season. Tick
ets can be purchased locally at Crandall's
in Palo Alto and at the Bookstore on
the campus.
All of the singers of the "Faust"
opera chorus are expected to attend
the last of the preliminary rehearsals
in Room 84 at 7:50 this evening.
Stage rehearsals at the Stadium will
begin tomorrow evening, at which
time measurements for costumes will
be taken. Members who are not pres
ent. will not be allowed to participate
in the performance.
