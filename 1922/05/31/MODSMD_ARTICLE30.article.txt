# AEROPLANES WILL BE USED FOR SURVEYING
## 
### 
"Aeroplanes offer undeveloped possi
bilities for laying out power lines and
making photographic maps," stated
Professor Harris J. Ryan, of the Elec
trical Engineering department, after a
flight with Paul Davis, '21, in the Stan
ford Flying School plane.
Professor Ryan believes that the ac
cessibility of any section of the country
can be better determined from an aero
plane than by an engineer exploring the
ground on foot, as the aviator can see
topographical formations which the en
gineer might miss.
Accurate photographic maps may be
made by flying at the same elevation
over the territory to be mapped, accord
ing to Professor Ryan. Ryan was en
thusiastic about the beauty of the cam
pus and the surrounding country as seen
from an aeroplane. He and Davis took
off from the Stanford polo field and
flew over Saratoga, Los Gatos, San Jose,
and Santa Clara, and across Dumbarton
Bridge to Menlo Park, Redwood City,
Spring valley, and back to Stanford.
When above Los Gatos, they could see
the Pacific Ocean to their right, San
Francisco to their left, and Stanford be
hind them.
Bernard Birnie, '23, owns the plane
in which Professor Ryan flew.
