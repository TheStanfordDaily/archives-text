# Several Costumes Used On Alumni Day Are Lost
## 
### 
Efforts are being made to recover
a number of costumes which disap
peared after the entertainment in the
Pavilion 011 the night of Alumni Day.
Included are several uppers and the
trousers of some of the cannibal cos
tumes. Students are being held res
ponsible, and inasmuch as the cos
tumes were rented, it is hoped that
those who know of their disappear
ance will please notify J. E. McDowell,
Alumni Secretary.
