Comptroller A. E. Roth, '09, is on his
way East to carry the First Million for
Stanford campaign to the alumni of the
University outside California, beginning
the final stages of that campaign. Pres
ident Wilbur will carry the campaign to
the Northwest next week, holding meet
ings in Washington and Oregon and
Montana. In the meantime Alumni Sec

up the alumni campaign within the state
in the one or two localities that have not
yet been touched. McDowell will go to
Monterey tomorrow to talk to the alumni
of that county.
Jt is clear now that Stanford people
in California will bring the total in the

$900,000, so that it is expected that the
sum contributed by the alumni will be
carried well into the second million be
fore the general public is appealed to.
Comptroller Roth spoke to the alumni
at Phoenix, Arizona, yesterday and to
morrow will address the Stanford peo
ple in Kansas City. Friday he will be
the speaker at a Stanford luncheon in
