# PRACTICES HELD FOR ARCHERY TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Archery practice for the tournament
Saturday afternoon indicates that high
scores will be made in the final com
petition. On account of the short time
the archers have had to practice, only
the women who have already proved
their ability in this sport are out for the
matches. Many of these were the point
winners in the tourney which Stanford
took from Mills College in March.
The woman who runs up the largest
score Saturday will be considered the
university archery champion. The Wo
men's Athletic Association will award
an individual silver cup to the winner.
Besides the cup, other awards will be
made. All women who make eighty
points on forty arrows shot will receive
fifty athletic points toward a letter.
Those having the four highest scores
will receive an additional twenty-five
points and will form the all-star archery
team for this year.
