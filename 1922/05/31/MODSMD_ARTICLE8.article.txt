# BREAKERS CLUB TAKES FIRST IN TRACK CONTEST
## Prizes for Highest Individual Point-Winner Go to Colgan Hundred Yard Finals Today 
### 
Breakers Club won the intramural
track meet, which was held last week,
making 22,754 points. They were hard
pressed by Theta Chi, with 22,U50, only
giving the winners a majority of 700
points. El Toro was third with 21,456.
The figures given Monday did not in
clude the results of tjie half mile, only
four events being included. No change
resulted in the standing of the first
three organizations following this check
of the 880 yards. Breakers led at that
time with 17,880 points; Theta Chi was
second with 17,294. Twenty-eight or
ganizations entered teams in this meet,
and seven of them ran up a score of
more than 5,0()0 points.
The honors for being the best indi
vidual athlete went Colgan, Delta
Tan Delta, who scored 3,171 points in
the five events. Allen, Delta Chi, was
second with 3,116 tallies, and Arthur. El
Toro, was third with 2,993. Both Col
gan and Allen passed Arthur in the race
for high point man after the 880-yard
dash was recorded. Arthur had been
first from the beginning of the meet un
til the final event. Both Colgan and
Allen ran the half mile well under
2:20 minutes, while Arthur's time
was 2:36.
The linals of the 100-yard dash, which
do not affect results of the meet, were
held this afternoon at 4:30. This event
would have been run off Monday, but
there were several men absent from the
campus and it was decided to postpone
it until after Memorial Day. The out
come of the race is uncertain. Hale,
who made the best time in the prelim
inaries, is laid up with an injured muscle
in his leg. The finish will probably see
Colgan Allen and Wright lighting it out
for tirst place.
Three placques will be given as prizes
to winners in the intramural meet.
Breakers will receive a trophy as win
ners of the entire meet. Sigma Chi, vic
tors in the 220-yard eight man relay, will
also be awarded a placque. The winner
of the 100-yard dash will also receive a
prize.
