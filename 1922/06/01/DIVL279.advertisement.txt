Graduation time is almost here, and with it the

in the months and years to come. —We suggest:
Kodaks Military Brushes
Fountain Pens Shaving Sets and Safety
Eversharp and Sheaffer Pencils Razor Sets
Leather Rollups Manicure Sets
Stationery
Ivory Pyralin
A gift of lasting beauty in complete sets or in single
pieces, easy to match at any time.

Various combinations of perfumes, toilet waters, face
powders, talcum powders, soaps and
perfume bottles.
Our stock of useful and pleasing remembrances is now on dis
