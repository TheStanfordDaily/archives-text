# NOMINATIONS FOR STUDENT OFFICERS COME IN SLOWLY
## 
### 
Candidates for student body president,
vicc-prcsident, and secretary still remain
among those missing, in spite of the fact
that there was a slight increase in the
number of nominations until noon to
day. As was the case yesterday, nom
inations were largely confined to class
officers. If the number of nominations
may be taken as a criterion, races for
class officcs will be closer and more
interesting than the contests for student
body positions.
The following nominations were
handed in this morning: for 1924 repre
sentative on the executive committee,
Alice Roth; for president of the class
of 1925, Charles Beardsley and A1 Smith;
for 1923 representative on the executive
committee, Pearl Bundick; for president
of the class of 1924, Junior Collins: for

secretary of the class of 1924, Emmet
McCaffery; for member of the Men's
Council, Claude Peavy.
Other nominations which were handed
in yesterday are as follows: for secre
tary of the class of 1925, Richard Jenk
ins ; for sophomore representative on
the executive committee, Gurdon Steele;
for Men's Council, Dudley DcGroot; for
member of the Board of Athletic Con
trol. R. W. Faville; for Quad editor,
Carl Shoup, 31 al Rorke, Dan Gage, Bob
Edwards, Matthew Tobrincr; for Quad
manager, Charles P. White, William G.
Lee, Neil Granger, Walter Levison.
But two days remain for filing nom
inations. The box will remain in front
of the Romanic Language building to
morrow from 8 to 4 and Monday from
Bto 12 o'clock. Nominations will closc
promptly at noon Monday.
