# ALPHA DELTA PHI AND KAPPA SIGMA WIN FIRST FINALS
## Extra Innings, Close Scores Mark Inter-League Contests 
### 
Nip-and-tuck baseball characterized
the opening inter-league intromural
baseball games, yesterday. Three
extra innings were necessary for Alpha
Delta Phi to administer a 2 to 1 de
feat to the Sigma Chi team and Kappa
Sigma repeated its old trick of losing
a ball game and (hen winning it. The
last uncertainty as to league leader
ship was settled when the Beta Theta
Pi went ten innings with Encina for
a 6 to 5 victory.
The Alpha Delta Phi —Sigma Chi
engagement was marked by a strong
defense and weak hitting on both
sides. Both teams lost opportunities
by inability to hit at the right time,
and the breaks, according to the gospel
of "Brick" Morse, decided the issue.
Alpha Delta Phi stepped into the lead
in the second inning, when Cunha
lifted a triple over the left-fielder's
head, and scored later on Pollard's
sacrifice fly to the same garden. Sig
ma Chi wasted two hits, one of them
a double by Macconel, and then in the
fifth inning tied the score when Kle
bahn singled, Krogness drew a pass,
and Dallas hit safely. Except for
Cleaveland's single in the eighth,
which was not converted into a run,
Neer held the Sigma Chi batsmen hit
less through the remaining five in
nings.
Alpha Delta Phi twice succeeded in
putting men on third base, but did
not develop the punch to bring one
this inning, with two men out, Wide
man punched out a scratch hit to the
second baseman, who threw wide for
first. A passed ball on this play put
Wideman on second. Janssen then
broke up the game by lifting a Texas
leaguer to second, which Talbert got
his hands on but could not hold. This
scored Wideman with the vital marker.
Kappa Sigma specializes in last
inning rallies, which are invariably
fatal to the opposition. The victims
of the latest was Phi Delta Theta,
which, in the course of two innings,
'ound a two-run lead made over into
a deficit of one run, which is enough
to win or lose any ball game. 5 to 4
in seven innings tells the tale.
Phi Delta Theta was off to a two
run advantage in the first frame, when
Langford got a lift on an error, Mc-
Hose singled, Edwards was the recipi
ent of another error, Piggott poled
out the hit which sent two men over.
Kappa Sigma, unable to rise to the oc
casion so early in the game, culled
home until the last of the tenth. In
but a single tally, on two errors, a
walk, and a fielder's choice. Phi Del
ta Theta maintained the supremacy
until Kappa Sigma's share of the fifth,
when Eskew strolled to the plate,
bounced the ball off the left field
fence, circled the base and tied the
score.
The sixth frame pioduced feverish
activity on both tiles. Rogers dis
posed of the first two men to face him,
2nd then blew up Langford, McHose,
Edwards, and Piggott hit safely in
rapid succession, and two tallies were
checked in at the plate. Rogeiß then
tightened up and struck Playter out
with two men on base. Kappa Sigma
needed two runs, and got them in
their half as follows: Roberts was hit
by the pitcher, but retired at second
on a close decision. Unsettled by this
incident, Edwards passed Powell and
Parish, and Shipkey was safe on an
other error. Powell counted on a field
er's choice to Eskew, and Farish cross
ed the plate when Conover grounded
out to short.
Entering the last inning with the
score tied, Phi Delta Theta went out
in order on two strike-outs and a
grounder to second. Aid, first men for
Kappa Sigma, was safe when the op
posing infield foozled his grounder. He
advanced to second and third on in
field outs, and Powell became the hero
of the afternoon by slapping out a
single that carried Aid down the home
stretch.
Rogers and Farish made up the
Kappa Sigma battery, with Edwards
and Kraft for the losers. Rogers fan
ned ten of the Phi Delta Thetas, and
Edwards retired eight opponents in
the same tashion.

but a single tally, on two errors, a
walk, and a fielder's choice. Phi Del
ta Theta maintained the supremacy
until Kappa Sigma's share of the fifth,
when Eskew strolled to the plate,
bounced the ball off the left field
fence, circled the base and tied the
score.
The sixth frame pioduced feverish
activity on both tiles. Rogers dis
posed of the first two men to face him,
2nd then blew up Langford, McHose,
Edwards, and Piggott hit safely in
rapid succession, and two tallies were
checked in at the plate. Rogeiß then
tightened up and struck Playter out
with two men on base. Kappa Sigma
needed two runs, and got them in
their half as follows: Roberts was hit
by the pitcher, but retired at second
on a close decision. Unsettled by this
incident, Edwards passed Powell and
Parish, and Shipkey was safe on an
other error. Powell counted on a field
er's choice to Eskew, and Farish cross
ed the plate when Conover grounded
out to short.
Entering the last inning with the
score tied, Phi Delta Theta went out
in order on two strike-outs and a
grounder to second. Aid, first men for
Kappa Sigma, was safe when the op
posing infield foozled his grounder. He
advanced to second and third on in
field outs, and Powell became the hero
of the afternoon by slapping out a
single that carried Aid down the home
stretch.
Rogers and Farish made up the
Kappa Sigma battery, with Edwards
and Kraft for the losers. Rogers fan
ned ten of the Phi Delta Thetas, and
Edwards retired eight opponents in
the same tashion.
Nip-and-tuck baseball characterized
the opening inter-league intromural
baseball games, yesterday. Three
extra innings were necessary for Alpha
Delta Phi to administer a 2 to 1 de
feat to the Sigma Chi team and Kappa
Sigma repeated its old trick of losing
a ball game and (hen winning it. The
last uncertainty as to league leader
ship was settled when the Beta Theta
Pi went ten innings with Encina for
a 6 to 5 victory.
The Alpha Delta Phi —Sigma Chi
engagement was marked by a strong
defense and weak hitting on both
sides. Both teams lost opportunities
by inability to hit at the right time,
and the breaks, according to the gospel
of "Brick" Morse, decided the issue.
Alpha Delta Phi stepped into the lead
in the second inning, when Cunha
lifted a triple over the left-fielder's
head, and scored later on Pollard's
sacrifice fly to the same garden. Sig
ma Chi wasted two hits, one of them
a double by Macconel, and then in the
fifth inning tied the score when Kle
bahn singled, Krogness drew a pass,
and Dallas hit safely. Except for
Cleaveland's single in the eighth,
which was not converted into a run,
Neer held the Sigma Chi batsmen hit
less through the remaining five in
nings.
Alpha Delta Phi twice succeeded in
putting men on third base, but did
not develop the punch to bring one
this inning, with two men out, Wide
man punched out a scratch hit to the
second baseman, who threw wide for
first. A passed ball on this play put
Wideman on second. Janssen then
broke up the game by lifting a Texas
leaguer to second, which Talbert got
his hands on but could not hold. This
scored Wideman with the vital marker.
Kappa Sigma specializes in last
inning rallies, which are invariably
fatal to the opposition. The victims
of the latest was Phi Delta Theta,
which, in the course of two innings,
'ound a two-run lead made over into
a deficit of one run, which is enough
to win or lose any ball game. 5 to 4
in seven innings tells the tale.
Phi Delta Theta was off to a two
run advantage in the first frame, when
Langford got a lift on an error, Mc-
Hose singled, Edwards was the recipi
ent of another error, Piggott poled
out the hit which sent two men over.
Kappa Sigma, unable to rise to the oc
casion so early in the game, culled
home until the last of the tenth. In
but a single tally, on two errors, a
walk, and a fielder's choice. Phi Del
