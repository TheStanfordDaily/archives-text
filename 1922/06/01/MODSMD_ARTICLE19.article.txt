r 1 Pagliacci. a musical drama in two
acts, and a prologue by Ruggiero Leon
cavallo, will open the Stanford Stadium
grand opera season Saturday evening.
Gaetano Merola, director in charge, is
in readiness for what he considers will
be the fulfillment of a project greater
than anything in the way of open-air
opera ever attempted in either the
United States or Europe.
The orchestra of 100 picked musicians
recruited from the ranks of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra and oth
er similar musical organizations have
been going over the different musical
scores. The ballet of fifty under the
personal direction of Natale Carossio,
Russian ballet master, has been rehears

while the chorus of 150 voices has been

The primitive theater of the comedians
is erected, and as they parade in fantas

glee by the peasants. Canio, the owner
of the troop, invites them all to the
evening play. He looks somewhat
gloomy, and resents the taunts of the
peasants who court his beautiful wife,
Nedda, and make remarks about the
Fool's attentions to her.
Canio finally gives way to his friends'
invitations for a glass of wine, and then
takes leave of his wife with a kiss.
Nedda, who is untrue to her husband,
trembles at his fiery words, but soon
casts these forebodings aside, and sings.
