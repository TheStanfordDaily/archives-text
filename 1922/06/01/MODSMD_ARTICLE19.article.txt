# World Famous Stars Are Gathered For Open Air Opera Production
## 
### 
r 1 Pagliacci. a musical drama in two
acts, and a prologue by Ruggiero Leon
cavallo, will open the Stanford Stadium
grand opera season Saturday evening.
Gaetano Merola, director in charge, is
in readiness for what he considers will
be the fulfillment of a project greater
than anything in the way of open-air
opera ever attempted in either the
United States or Europe.
The orchestra of 100 picked musicians
recruited from the ranks of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra and oth
er similar musical organizations have
been going over the different musical
scores. The ballet of fifty under the
personal direction of Natale Carossio,
Russian ballet master, has been rehears
ing on the beach by the Cliff House,
while the chorus of 150 voices has been
practicing steadily for the past three
months.
Giovanni Martinelli, the world's lead
ing tenor of the Metropolitan Opera
Company, who has been successfully fol
lowing in the footsteps of the late En
rico Caruso's chief roles, will sing the
part of Canio in 'TPagliacci" Saturday
night. Nedda will be played by Bianca
Saroya, soprano, who was with the Bos
ton Opera Company, and who has re
cently returned f.rom European capitals,
where she is said to have created a fu
rore in operatic circles. Vicente Bal
lester. baritone of the Chicago Opera
'Association, will sing Tonio; A. Neri will
play the part of Beppe; while Marsden
Argall, local baritone, will sing Silvio.
In the prologue of "I'Pagliacci," To
nio, the Fool, announces to the public
the deep tragic sense which often is
hidden behind a farce, and prepares them
for the sad end of the lovers in this com
edy. Then the performance begins,
showing the entry of a troop of wander
ing actors so common in southern Italy.
The primitive theater of the comedians
is erected, and as they parade in fantas
tic costumes, they are received with high
glee by the peasants. Canio, the owner
of the troop, invites them all to the
evening play. He looks somewhat
gloomy, and resents the taunts of the
peasants who court his beautiful wife,
Nedda, and make remarks about the
Fool's attentions to her.
Canio finally gives way to his friends'
invitations for a glass of wine, and then
takes leave of his wife with a kiss.
Nedda, who is untrue to her husband,
trembles at his fiery words, but soon
casts these forebodings aside, and sings.
The ugly Tonio, spying Nedda for the
moment alone, becomes offensive in bis
attentions to her, whereupon she strikes
him with a whip, which drives him to
frenzy. In departing, he swears revenge.
Hardly has Tonio turned away when
the peasant Silvio appears and entreats
Nedda to separate herself from the hus
band she had never loved and take
flight with him. Nedda hesitates, but
finally sinks into his arms. Tonio, who
has been listening to the conversation,
calls Canio and Beppo, and it is with
great difficulty that Silvio escapes un
recognized by the pursuing clown.
Canio returns angered, dagger in hand,
and demands from Nedda the name of
her lover. He is about to stab his wife
when Beppo, the Harlequin, intervenes,
and, snatching the dagger from his mas
ter's hands, intimates that it is time to
prepare for the play. While Nedda re
tires, Canio breaks out into a bitter wail
of his hard lot which cimpels him to take
part in farce, which for him is bitter
reality. With this air, the tragic height
of the opera is reached.
In the second act, the troop's comedy
begins before the as|/unbled peasants.
Columbine, represented by Nedda, in
collecting the money, finds time to warn
Silvio of her husband's wrath. As the
curtain of the traveling theater opens,
Nedda is seen alone on the stage, listen
ing to.the sentimental songs of Arlequin,
her lover in the play. Tonio, playing
the role of Toddeo, the Fool, rvs it really
happened in the morning, now makes
love to her in the play, and, as before,
is repulsed. Arlequin and Columbine
are dining merrily when Toddeo, re-en
tering. announces the arrival of the hus
band. Bajasso, played by Canio. The
latter, however, is terribly in earnest,
and when he hoarsely asks the lover's
name, the lookers-on who hitherto have
applauded every scene, begin to feel the
awful tragedy hidden behind the com
edy. When Columbine replies lightly,
naming the innocent Arlequin as the
man who had dined with her, Canio'J
wrath rises to fury, and he wildly
curses her. Seizing a knife from the
table, he stabs Nedda as she tries to
save her life by escaping into the crowd.
As Silvio comes to her aid, he too is
killed by the enraged husband, who had
heard his name slip from the dying lips
of his wife. All are filled with horror
and dismay, and stand, not knowing
what to do. Canio,' limp and broken
hearted, stands by his wife's corpse and
mutters, "Go! Go! the farce is ended."
"I'Pagiacci" will begin at 8 o'clock
sharp and will be over by 10:45. A
popular afternoon concert by the or
chestra of 100 pieces will be given Sun
day in the Stadium at 2:30 and will last
until 4 o'clock. Tickets for all per
formances can be purchased at Crandall's
in Palo Alto and at the Bookstore on
the campus.
