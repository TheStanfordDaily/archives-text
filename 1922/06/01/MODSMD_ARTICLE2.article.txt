# MOULTON DESCRIBED AS PIONEER RUNNER IN NEXT PICTORIAL
## 
### 
Foot-race champion for 73 yearsâ€”
thus is "Dad" Moulton, trainer of Stan
ford athletes for twenty seasons, char
acterized in the June Pictorial. Moul
ton's early career among the pioneer
settlers and traders along the Cali
fornia trail, his foot-race victories over
frontiersmen and his contests with
western athletes which gave him a
reputation among pioneer runners as
unbeatable, are sketched by Tom
Irwin, '23.
Moulton is known today as the lead
ing track-builder on the Pacific Coast.
He supervised the construction of the
huge Panama-Pacific Exposition track
and before that was in charge of the
oval at the Lewis and Clark Fair in
1904, and of the Alaska-Yukon Pacific
Fair at Seattle.
The Stadium track is at present oc
cupying Moulton's attention. His plans
for the path, the grade of cinders he
is striving for and why this grade is
necessary, are outlined in the coming
Pictorial.
Onion George makes his bow in the
coming issue, out next week. Tom
Kleckner, who for two years has
chronicled the utterances of his plain
spoken friend is leaving this, his vale
of tears, for the outer world, and
Onion tells the prospective graduates
what it feels like. Onion, who has
been proud of his reputation as a ruff,
relents and mentions specifically the
co-educational element in parting.
