# CONTINUITY ASSURED

### 
With the election of Tom Irwin to the editorship
of the Daily Palo Alto today the third election
without any political competition has passed. In the
last two years the Daily has come from a publication
of personal ambition to where it honestly reflects the
efforts of a concerted body whether the efforts result
for good or not. Under the principle of logical suc
cession the managing editor follows the editor to the
leadership of the paper. This does away with com
petition for the office, to be sure, and some will say
ft savors of the appointive system, whereby the editor
names his successor.
The system as it works out is only so in part, and
that for the best. It eliminates the forming of fac
tions within the staff and brings the paper into a
smoother career as regards policy. In certain things
one editor and the next may differ, and usually it is
so, but these are for the most part not of importance
and no special shake-up is made at the change of term.
A better feeling is created on the staff, and the com
radeship within the paper is maintained.
It may be expected that next year will be a better
year than the present, and Irwin has best wishes for
a good "turn at the wheel."
