# HUMOR THAT SCORES
## 
### 
When "Chappie" took second place among all the
-college comics in the country in the college wits con
test held this year by Judge, we realize that here at
Stanford we have a magazine that is something more
than a mere comic sheet which clips its jokes from
the exchanges and publishes a "magazine" once a
month.
1 lammer and Coffin, the society under which Chap
arral flourishes, is one of the most successful socie
ties of its kind. The reason is that it is not content
to let things ride when they seem to be going right.
The aim is always toward construction. This spirit
is reflected more and more in the publication. The
magazine as a whole gets better and better, and this
is made easier by the use of better art work, which,
in turn, is made possible by the revenue coming in
from the increase in advertising which the advertisers
send in as they realize the worth of the magazine.
The Cornell Widow was first in the contest with
some six hundred points. Chaparral came next with
five hundred and fifty. The nearest competitors did
not get above two hundred, leaving the first two col
lege comics without any running mates at all as far as
real competition went.
It is good to see our magazines being recognized
as being so good through the country. It means a lot
of good publicity. 1 lammer and Coffin merits con
gratulations, and has our best wish for greater suc
cess in years to come.
