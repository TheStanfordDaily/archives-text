# "HAIL THE WOMAN"
## 
### 
The Woman's Edition of the Daily will be pub
lished tomorrow. Bertha Vaughan is the main char
acter in this issue, with Mary Jane Clark as her first
assistant. This is about the only chance we will have
to get personal with the women of the staff, and so
will say that in the two mentioned above the Daily
has had two of the best women writers that ever
graced the staff. Both arc excellent from the execu
tive standpoint and have proved invaluable in the
last two terms. With two women of such journalistic
prowess as pace makers the Women's Issue ought to
lie better than ever before. We wait expectantly.
