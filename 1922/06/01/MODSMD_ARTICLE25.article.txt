SIDELIGHTS ON THE ELECTIONS
At a great expense of time, labor, money, and breath
(latter expended, chiefly in departing from the scene
of the interview) Cabbages has compiled a first-hand
directory of political information on the various candi
dates for the forthcoming elections.

For Student Body President:
1. Cyrus Hornwoggle. Hornwoggle has played three
years on the track team. The coach says he is the
greatest track player he ever saw—that all he ever does
is play. Cyrus is a debater of note. However, he has
considerable difficulty in getting his note discounted at
the bank. His debates with the Econ Prof, have attract
ed campus-wide attention, particularly with the scholar
ship committee. Hornwoggle favors prohibition, especi
ally grappo.
2. Archimedes Sideham. Sideham transferred here
hurriedly from Illinois. Many prominent citizens were
at the station to see him off, among whom were the
sheriff and the chief of police. Sideham is opposed to
wood alcohol. Since his arrival here he has been
prominently associated with research work in the Psy
chology of the Feeble-Minded. He received an A in
the course.

For Vice-President:
I. Obadiah Hawggy. Hawggy promises his aid in
ridding the campus of alcohol. A man of Hawggy's
official capacity is bound to be of considerable assist
ance. Hawggy can let liquor alone any time he pleases.
He let it alone twice yesterday.

For Secretary:
1. Henrietta Hoshish. Henrietta, affectionately called
"Pie-face" by her friends, can read and write, and speaks
a little English. With these qualifications she should
be a knock-out of a Secretary.
2. Simplicita Pankeck. Simplicita is a girl of sterling
qualities. After counting the silverware her sorority
agrees with this statement. Simplicita also reads and
writes, and in addition speaks a little Yiddish, which
is bound to be an asset in welcoming the frosh class
next fall.

For Treasurer:
1. Oswald Ossining. Oswald is a safe man, although
he also dabbles in second-story work when safes are
scarce. Entrust money to his care and you will never
have to worry about it again.
2. Percy Penwiper. Percy also came from the East
highly recommended. The vigilante committee would
have recommended him higher but they were out of
rope. Percy won the national intercollegiate crap
shooting contest last year, being high point man with
108 sevens in a row, where needed most. He is also
a ten-second man, having developed his speed con
siderably after the match. He will make a splended
run for office, and away from it, not to mention with it.

For Quad Editor:
1. Henry Homespun. Henry is a good boy but he
chews tobacco. He is in favor of making the Quad a
weekly publication. Vote for Henry and a pink Quad.
He contributes to the Police Gazette.

That, ladies and gentlemen, finishes the list, which
goes to prove that there is still some justice in the
world.
