# MONEY IN THE BOOK
## 
### 
A hasty review of the 1923 Quad is insufficient on
which to base more than a general criticism. There
is no doubt, however, that the -yearbook which has
just come before the campus is meeting with a won
derful response. The material presented is unusually
well organized, the customary blunders practically
absent, and the editing of the junior Quad seems to
have carried more thought and understanding of its
purpose than that of any within our memory.
But a mere glance at the new Quad shows one
thing for certain. There is money in it. There was
a time when Quad managers toured South America
on the profits of the yearbook. It is remembered that
only in the la#t three years has the Stanford Quad
come out of the paper-back class into one worthy of
the University. Beginning with its cover, full leather
for the first time, and to the last detail of printing,
paper, and workmanship, the new yearbook shows
that money has been spent in producing it.a good
many hundred dollars more than ever previously
The quantity and character of the advertising also
bears this out.
Whatever will be the final general verdict of the
editing, it is certain that of the managing there can
be but one opinion. The management has been
flawless; it has produced the money, which it has put
into the book, without selfishly reserving for that sur
plus out of which the manager and editor draw. Of
course the editor comes in for his share of the credit
for co-operation in management, as the manager does
for his work with the editorial department. And
whatever may be the general verdict of the ten
months' time and thought which has been devoted to
the editor's task, it is our opinion that it will be
mighty favorable. The editor, \Y. M. Kilpatrick,
and Manager Phil Landis deserve sincere congratu
lations.
