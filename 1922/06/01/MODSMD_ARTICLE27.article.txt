# WORLD NEWS IN BRIEF
## 
### 
IRISH WAR AND PEACE
The agreement between the Free-
Staters and the Republicans permits
the early holding of an election, but
on such terms that the real opinion of
the country cannot be determined. For
the leaders at Dublin will agree upon
an "offiicial" list of candidates whose
election will leave the balance of the
parties in the Dail unchanged. A coa
lition ministry will then be organized,
containing four Republicans and five
Free-State adherents. The Republi
cans will be permitted to hold office
without taking the oath of allegiance
to the King. This constitutes a viola
tion of the treaty. Winston Churchill
declared on behalf of the British
Government that if a Republic is de
clared in Ireland, British troops will
re-occupy the country.
REPARATIONS COMMISSION
RELENTS
The Reparations Commission has
granted Germany another moratorium
extending through 1922, but condition
ed upon the good faith of Germany in
carrying out a program looking toward
financial recovery and payment. The
crisis which Europe looked for on
May 31 is thus averted by the action
of Poincare, who controls the Com
mission, but France still retains the
right to bring on a crisis on European
affairs at any moment, by getting the
Commission to insist on payment.
WESTERN STATES UNITE
AGAINST JAPANESE
The Western State Agricultural rep
resentatives, meeting in Sacramento,
have adopted a resolution urging
Federal action to protect western farm
ers against the competition of Japa
nese. Eleven states are represented
in the appeal.
