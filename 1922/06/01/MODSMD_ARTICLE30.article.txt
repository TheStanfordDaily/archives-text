Can a stimulating book be written 011
an old subject without propounding
any new and startling theories? It
can if the writer knows his subject
thoroughly, and has judgment, a sense
of balance and literary ability. This
is what Professor R. M. Aldeu proves
in his recent book "Shakespeare," pub
lished by Duffield in New York and
now 011 sale at the Stanford Book
store. It is the latest volume in the
Master Spirits of Literature series,
edited by Professor Noyes of the Uni
versity of California. It is simple and
readable in style, and does not ab
strude its learning. Mr. Aldenrises
with his subject; chapters most dif
ficult to write are the best, especially
those on tragedy, and shows his
eminent judgment and sanity when he
writes of personality
and opinions. He avoids the tempta
tion to draw on his imagination, or
infer all kinds of things about the
man Shakespeare for which there is
no evidence, yet without going be
yond what we clearly see in Shakes
peare's very impersonal writings, he
makes us feel that we really know a
good many fundamental things about
the man and his views of life. The
grasp, sanity, and sympathy of the
book make it one of the best there is
for any one who wishes to understand
Shakespeare and to know why he is
the greatest of poets.
