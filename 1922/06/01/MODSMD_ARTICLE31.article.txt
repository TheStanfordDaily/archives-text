### 
Twenty volumes of "New English
Drama" with prefaetory remarks, bio
graphical sketches, notes, critical and
explanatory, are found among the new
books at the Library for this week.
Edited by W. Oxberry, a leading
comedian of his time, these books
form tne only existing edition which
is faithfully marked with the stage
business and directions as performer
at the Theatre Royal.
This collection of dramas contains
Shakespeare's "Richard III," "Ham
let," "As You Like It," "Romeo and
Juliet," "King Lear," and "Julius
Caesar." Some of the other better
known plays in this edition are "She
Stops to Conquer," "Rob Roy," "Guy
Mannering," "Kenilworth," and ''Ta
merlane."
Among the new books are four very
old and famous Aldus publications.
Poent" "Silii Ifalici 'de
Bello Punico Libri XVII," printed in
1523, and "Macrobins," first and last
edition printed in 1528, are excellent
examples of medieval letterpress.
