# FIREMAN'S BAND TO FURNISH MUSIC AT CHILDREN'S CIRCUS
## 
### 
The San Francisco Fireman's Band
has been obtained by Fire Captain Ed
Lamb to furnish the music at the Juve
nile Circus and Horse Show which will
be given Saturday afternoon, June 10,
on the A. G. C. Hahn estate in Menlo
Park, for the benefit of the Stanford
Home for Convalescent Children.
Although the proceeds from the cir
cus will go toward raising the $100,-
000 endowment fund for the Conva
lescent Home, the Women's Auxiliary
is financing the construction of an
addition to the Home. When com
pleted, and the work is well under
way now, the addition will double the
present upstairs sleeping porch for
the boys and add a sleeping porch and
bath to the living room of Mrs. Chase,
the matron of the Home. This latter
change will permit Mrs. Chase's suite
to be isolated for use as a quarantine
ward when the children have any con
tagious illnesses.
A four-patient ward will be installed
in the present dining room which is
used only during the winter months.
It is hoped that by next fall further
additions will have been made in
order that the ward in the dining room
may be permanent. A registered nurse,
a graduate of the Stanford School for
Nurses, has been secured as resident
nurse at the Home; she will begin her
services by next week.
A hardwood floor has been laid in
the upstairs play room; this also was
given by the Women's Auxiliary.
Except for an enlargement of the
small porch on the northern side of
the building, no further additions will
be made to the Home after these now
under construction have been finished.
Plans for the future provide for an
administration building and a series
of detached units, arranged on the
quadrangle style.
