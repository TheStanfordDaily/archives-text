# MANY STUDENTS EARN WHOLE OR PART OF UNIVERSITY EXPENSES

Herbert Hoover helped earn his
expenses at Stanford by conducting
a laundry agency. Since then, Stan
ford men and women in increasing
numbers have been working their
whole or part way through college.
The occupations are many and vari
ed depending on the work available at
the Appointment Office or at private
homes. Many of the students "hash";
others clerk in stores in Palo Alto;
student journalists work as newspaper
correspondents; some serve as tutors
in private families, or as assistants to
members of the faculty; musicians
play for social affairs; while others
act as watchmen or work at nearby
automobile service stations.
Among the women, the work is also
varied, serving as stenographers, as
teachers, telephone operators, "hash
ers," housekeepers, and seamstresses.
Approximately $83,364 was earned
by Stanford students working their
way through college last year. At the
University of California, no totals were
kept on the amount earned, but it was
said that 24 per cent of the men stu
dents and 10 per cent of the women
were entirely self-supporting. Twenty
nine per cent of the men and 6 per
cent of the women earned more than
half of their expenses, and 20 per
cent of the men and 14 per cent of
the women made less than half. Twen
ty-six per cent of the men and 69 per.
cent of the women contributed nothing
to their support.
Many of the students make enough
during their summer vacations to
carry them through the following
school year. They are finding earlier
work than they did several years ago,
for at Stanford there were unfulfilled
calls last summer for men to work in
lumber camps.
Probably the highest paid California
student is an engineering student who
works a full shift, from 4 p.m. to mid
night in an electrical substation and
receives full pay amounting to $150 a
month. One woman works as chauf
feur several hours a day, receiving
$100 a month.
