# Tooth of Ancient Sea Monster Unearthed in Lime Beds at Torrance
## 
### 
Speaking of fish stories, here's
a shark only 120 feet long, and
taken singlehanded by Dr. Jordan
and by Professor Chester Stark,
eminent geologist.
Piscatorially speaking, it was
a find rather than a catch, since
it was a million or more years
old, and in fact only a tooth
measuring 4y 2 inches in length
was taken. The two research sci
entists found the appendage day
before yesterday in the lime pits
of Terrance near Los Angeles,
and they say it is a relic of the
largest sea tiger ever known to
have sported or ravaged in Pacific
waters. It was in its prime in
the Pleistocene age.
