# SCHERL LEVY TAKES PRIZE IN CONTEST OF LOCAL SCRIBES
## Production of One-Act Plays In Assembly Hall Brings Recognition For Ability 
### 
By K. N. Stewart, '23.
What was the most noteworthy thing
about last night's performance in the
Assembly Hall?
Was it the complete representation,
from the writing of the lines in each of
the two plays presented to the painting
of sets, of worthy student effort?
Was it the discovery of a playwright
with a remarkable ability to reproduce
family conversation, a real plot sense
and a recognition of humor?
Was it the emotional heights reached
by Helen Whitney and Lester Seib in
the interpretation of roles which re
quired actual dramatic ability?
Was it the appreciative silence with
which the filled auditorium received
both productions?
For a large part of the campus the
conclusion of the Dramatic Council one
act play contest, won by Scherl Levy's
"Flesh and Blood," will close the stage
year, and a .memorable close it was.
The campus this year has been edu
cated to appreciate real ability and ama
teur standards are no longer suitable in
criticising the work of local artists—the
word is used advisedly. There were
gathered last night, before the footlights
and behind the scencs, the best that has
been developed in the present progres
sive era of Stanford dramatics. Con
sider their work and the vehicles which
furnished them the opportunity.
First of all, let us pause and give
thanks for Helen Whitney and Lester
Seib. Seib brought tears to many eyes
and silenced the engineers in his char
acterization of the pathetically dutiful
Papa Gildstein. It seems almost sacre
ligious to criticise one who has attained
such finish as Seib's, but there were
those who felt that a little stiffness in
gesture in some of the pantomime de
tracted the least bit from his effective
ness. Which furnishes a good oppor
tunity to remark upon the wealth of
pantomime in both plays. For seconds
at a time not a sound came from stage
or audience—yet there was no feeling
of uneasiness as is usually occasioned
by such pauses 111 amateur productions.
The audience had confidence in the cast
and there was silence during all of the
skillfully directed pantomime.
"One in a Hundred," by Darwin R.
Martin, in which Helen Whitney was
the center of attraction, was true melo
drama and the amateur showed through
the intensity of the scenes. As for Miss
Whitney—she has voice, she has per
sonality, she has poise, she has grace—
but, stop, this might easily become a
eulogy upon the real actress of the
campus. To prevent that, let us con
cede that at times she is a bit too grace
ful—but that is all.
We thank Cecil Morris and Hal Bum
baugh for not burlesquing their drunk
enness. Norris James lacked restraint,
but the wronged husband's part was a
hard one to play. Dick Richmond stead
ily gains assurance, hut if running away
with another man!s wife were the mat
ter-of-fact affair he made of it, it would
be no more worthy a subject for a play
than taking a co-ed to Stickey's for a
coke. A word for Thomas Carskadon,
who directed the play, and we shall pass
on to the real treat, "Flesh and Blood."
Lester Seih and Margaret Bailie lost
their own identity in that of Papa and
Mama Gildstein, but evidently in strain
ing for her Jewish dialect, Miss Bailie
lost most of her lines in the first half
of the play. One of the best bits of
her interpretation was. the break from
excited remonstration to silent anguish
following Wally's departure. Ray Haiz
lip and Lester Seih handled profession
ally the intensely dramatic denunciation
and expulsion scene. Dorothy Sherrard
was typically Rosine Gilstein and all that
Newton Langerman lacked was a little
better appreciation of inflection.
How much of the credit for the suc
cessful presentation is due the directors
is hard to determine, but Arnold Bayley
and Chrysella Dunker must have worked
hard, for there was not a hitch of any
kind detectable.
Marion Petray's skeleton set fur
nished a pleasing background for both
plays.
Whatever your answer to the intro
ductory questions, the performance last
night nvs noteworthy and those who
stayed away missed something.

What was the most noteworthy thing
about last night's performance in the
Assembly Hall?
Was it the complete representation,
from the writing of the lines in each of
the two plays presented to the painting
of sets, of worthy student effort?
Was it the discovery of a playwright
with a remarkable ability to reproduce
family conversation, a real plot sense
and a recognition of humor?
Was it the emotional heights reached
by Helen Whitney and Lester Seib in
the interpretation of roles which re
quired actual dramatic ability?
Was it the appreciative silence with
which the filled auditorium received
both productions?
For a large part of the campus the
conclusion of the Dramatic Council one
act play contest, won by Scherl Levy's
"Flesh and Blood," will close the stage
year, and a .memorable close it was.
The campus this year has been edu
cated to appreciate real ability and ama
teur standards are no longer suitable in
criticising the work of local artists—the
word is used advisedly. There were
gathered last night, before the footlights
and behind the scencs, the best that has
been developed in the present progres
sive era of Stanford dramatics. Con
sider their work and the vehicles which
furnished them the opportunity.
First of all, let us pause and give
thanks for Helen Whitney and Lester
Seib. Seib brought tears to many eyes
and silenced the engineers in his char
acterization of the pathetically dutiful
Papa Gildstein. It seems almost sacre
ligious to criticise one who has attained
such finish as Seib's, but there were
those who felt that a little stiffness in
gesture in some of the pantomime de
tracted the least bit from his effective
ness. Which furnishes a good oppor
tunity to remark upon the wealth of
pantomime in both plays. For seconds
at a time not a sound came from stage
or audience—yet there was no feeling
of uneasiness as is usually occasioned
by such pauses 111 amateur productions.
The audience had confidence in the cast
and there was silence during all of the
skillfully directed pantomime.
"One in a Hundred," by Darwin R.
Martin, in which Helen Whitney was
the center of attraction, was true melo
drama and the amateur showed through
the intensity of the scenes. As for Miss
Whitney—she has voice, she has per
sonality, she has poise, she has grace—
but, stop, this might easily become a
eulogy upon the real actress of the
campus. To prevent that, let us con
cede that at times she is a bit too grace
ful—but that is all.
