# NOTED TENOR IS HERE FOR OPEN AIR GRAND OPERA
## Chorus of Sixty Voices Under Direction of Merola Will Rehearse "Faust" in Bowl 
### 
Giovanni Martinelli, popularly known
as "the second Caruscr," made his first
trip west of the Rocky Mountains and
arrived yesterday in San Francisco, in
an enthusiastic mood over the prospects
of tomorrow evening's opening of _the
opera program. The famous tenor will
open the song-fest, singing the role of
Canio in "I'Pagliacci," in the Stadium,
at 8:30.
From Martinelli's point of view there
is no doubt that the operas will be an
artistic success, although he faces un
known factors. Signor Martinelli will
sing in open air opera for the first time
in the history of his musical career, and
lie is as interested as a scientist trying an
experiment in what is to happen to his
tone color and resonance, without the
aid of four walls, a roof and intricate
acoutistics. "When Maestro Merola
asked me to conic out here," he said, "1
did not hesitate a moment, as the ex
perience will he well worth the trip
across the continent, and I shall have an
interesting time finding just* the right
tone and volume in order to preserve
the clarity of tone without forcing."
Great faith in Maestro Merola was
expressed by Signor Martinelli, and he
declared that his efficient direction of
this novel enterprise will greatly aid in
establishing the reputation of Western
ers as music lovers, a fact that New
York lias long been too absorbed to rec
ognize. It is only logical that San I 1 ran
cisco will be the home of the third great
permanent opera company in the United
States, and musical resources on the
coast give promise that the company will
he a credit to America, according to a
statement made by Martinelli yesterday
on his arrival.
Maestro Gaetano Mcrola was enthu
siastic in his praise of the work ac
complished by tlie student chorus that
will be a feature in the production of
"Faust" on June 10. At the first re
hearsals held in the stadium, Thursday
night, under the direction of Mcrola,
measuring was begun for the costumes
for the cast. A chorus of sixty was
available from those who took part in
the production of "Faust" in concert
form, under the direction of Organist
Allen, last spring quarter. "Faust," by
Charles Francois Gounod, is particular
ly fitted to an open air production, as
Gounod had .the ability to direct and
utilize large masses of vocal sound so as
to develop the mechanism of sonority
that makes the successful undertaking of
so great a protest as an open-air opera
possible.
The hundred musicians picked from
the ranks of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra,'who are accompanying
the operatic production, will give a
popular concert Sunday afternoon, June
4, in the stadium. They will be assisted
by the soloists of 'TPagliacci" and A
Cappello, the choir of the College of
the Pacific. A Cappello recently gave a
chant of sacred music in the Memorial
Church.

so great a protest as an open-air opera
possible.
The hundred musicians picked from
the ranks of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra,'who are accompanying
the operatic production, will give a
popular concert Sunday afternoon, June
4, in the stadium. They will be assisted
by the soloists of 'TPagliacci" and A
Cappello, the choir of the College of
the Pacific. A Cappello recently gave a
chant of sacred music in the Memorial
Church.
Giovanni Martinelli, popularly known
as "the second Caruscr," made his first
trip west of the Rocky Mountains and
arrived yesterday in San Francisco, in
an enthusiastic mood over the prospects
of tomorrow evening's opening of _the
opera program. The famous tenor will
open the song-fest, singing the role of
Canio in "I'Pagliacci," in the Stadium,
at 8:30.
From Martinelli's point of view there
is no doubt that the operas will be an
artistic success, although he faces un
known factors. Signor Martinelli will
sing in open air opera for the first time
in the history of his musical career, and
lie is as interested as a scientist trying an
experiment in what is to happen to his
tone color and resonance, without the
aid of four walls, a roof and intricate
acoutistics. "When Maestro Merola
asked me to conic out here," he said, "1
did not hesitate a moment, as the ex
perience will he well worth the trip
across the continent, and I shall have an
interesting time finding just* the right
tone and volume in order to preserve
the clarity of tone without forcing."
Great faith in Maestro Merola was
expressed by Signor Martinelli, and he
declared that his efficient direction of
this novel enterprise will greatly aid in
establishing the reputation of Western
ers as music lovers, a fact that New
York lias long been too absorbed to rec
ognize. It is only logical that San I 1 ran
cisco will be the home of the third great
permanent opera company in the United
States, and musical resources on the
coast give promise that the company will
he a credit to America, according to a
statement made by Martinelli yesterday
on his arrival.
Maestro Gaetano Mcrola was enthu
siastic in his praise of the work ac
complished by tlie student chorus that
will be a feature in the production of
"Faust" on June 10. At the first re
hearsals held in the stadium, Thursday
night, under the direction of Mcrola,
measuring was begun for the costumes
for the cast. A chorus of sixty was
available from those who took part in
the production of "Faust" in concert
form, under the direction of Organist
Allen, last spring quarter. "Faust," by
Charles Francois Gounod, is particular
ly fitted to an open air production, as
Gounod had .the ability to direct and
utilize large masses of vocal sound so as
to develop the mechanism of sonority
that makes the successful undertaking of
so great a protest as an open-air opera
possible.
