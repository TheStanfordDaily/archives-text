# MRS. TREAT MEETS FORMER STANFORD WOMEN ABROAD

### 
"Stanford women 1 in the Orient ?"
Mrs. Paysoir J. Treat, wife of Professor
Treat of the History department, who
accompanied him on his recent trip to
the Orient, settled down to recount her
meeting with several former members of
Stanford's Five Hundred while in Ja
pan, Korea, and the Hawaiian Islands.
"The first Stanford woman whom we
met was Doris Estcourt, '17, who was
booked on the same steamer for the out
going trip. Miss Estcourt had been as
sistant editor of the Journal of Flee
tricity in San Francisco, was on
her way to Japan as the first step in a
trip to 'see the world,' as she expressed
it. Later we met her again in Peking,
where she had apparently given up the
globe-trotting idea, and had accepted a
position as secretary to Mr. Goodrich,
who is the head of the China Medical
Board, the executive body of the Rocke
feller Foundation in that country. She
is at present keeping house with three
other American girls and is settled in
definitely in her new surroundings.
"At Tokyo we were met on the dock
by Mrs. Takako Tanaka (Taka Takan
ashi, '17), who is among the most active
workers for (he betterment of economic
conditions among the women of Japan.
She was sent by the Japanese govern
ment to the Washington Labor Confer
ence to represent the women of her
country in the adjustment of labor con
ditions, and has since been a frequent
contributor to the various women's mag
azines in Japan. Her articles have been
for the most part on the subject of
women in labor. Her horr.e is in Tokyo,

where Mr. Tanaka is a professor at
Waseda University.
"Two other Stanford women whom
we saw while in Tokyo were Mrs. Wil
liam C. Colyer (Miriam Bryan, '15) and
Mrs. 11. Selden Brown (Jessie Hall.'l 3).
Mrs. Colvcr, with her husband and
daughter, has been living in the Orient
for several years, where Mr. Colyer is
at present connected with an American
Trading Company. Mrs. Brown has
been living for some time in Tokyo,
but lias, since our visit, returned to
America.
"Tokyo seems to have been made the
favored spot of former Stanfordites, for
it was also here that we met Miss S.
Ishihashi, sister of Professor Ishihashi,
who is now at Stanford. Miss Ishihashi
is at present teaching English at thd
Conservatory of Music and is visiting
classes at the Imperial University of
Tokyo.
"At Yokohama we found Mary Baker,
'13, who had just returned from a visit
to the United States. For seven years
Miss Baker was active in the work of
the Young Women's Christian Associa
tion at Yokohama, but since her trip
home has become interested in the
prison reform movement, which she is
now using her every effort to further.
"Helen Thoburn, '08, daughter of one
of Stanford's pioneer professors, greeted
us at Shanghai. She is acting as head
of the publicity work for the Young
Men's Christian Association in that city.
"In a delightful Korean home in the
mountain district of Unsan, we came
upon Mrs. Alfred Wellhavcn (Emelie
Stevenson, '00). Mr. Wellhavcn is at
present superintendent of the American
gold mines of Unsan, and they are set
tled in the heart of a beautiful region,
.where, with their two charming daugh
ters, they have been living for a num
ber of years.
"The trip home brought us in contact
with two more of Stanford's women
graduates, Mrs. H. A. R. Austin (Beat
rice Hancock, '18) and Laura V.
Schwartz, '19, both of whom are living
in Hawaii.# Miss Schwartz is at present
an instructor at the University of
Hawaii, and is* planning to return to
Stanford in October to obtain her Ph. D.
degree."
And thus it is that the Stanford Fam
ily helps to join hands around the
world.

"The trip home brought us in contact
with two more of Stanford's women
graduates, Mrs. H. A. R. Austin (Beat
rice Hancock, '18) and Laura V.
Schwartz, '19, both of whom are living
in Hawaii.# Miss Schwartz is at present
an instructor at the University of
Hawaii, and is* planning to return to
Stanford in October to obtain her Ph. D.
degree."
And thus it is that the Stanford Fam
ily helps to join hands around the
world.
"Stanford women 1 in the Orient ?"
Mrs. Paysoir J. Treat, wife of Professor
Treat of the History department, who
accompanied him on his recent trip to
the Orient, settled down to recount her
meeting with several former members of
Stanford's Five Hundred while in Ja
pan, Korea, and the Hawaiian Islands.
"The first Stanford woman whom we
met was Doris Estcourt, '17, who was
booked on the same steamer for the out
going trip. Miss Estcourt had been as
sistant editor of the Journal of Flee
tricity in San Francisco, was on
her way to Japan as the first step in a
trip to 'see the world,' as she expressed
it. Later we met her again in Peking,
where she had apparently given up the
globe-trotting idea, and had accepted a
position as secretary to Mr. Goodrich,
who is the head of the China Medical
Board, the executive body of the Rocke
feller Foundation in that country. She
is at present keeping house with three
other American girls and is settled in
definitely in her new surroundings.
"At Tokyo we were met on the dock
by Mrs. Takako Tanaka (Taka Takan
ashi, '17), who is among the most active
workers for (he betterment of economic
conditions among the women of Japan.
She was sent by the Japanese govern
ment to the Washington Labor Confer
ence to represent the women of her
country in the adjustment of labor con
ditions, and has since been a frequent
contributor to the various women's mag
azines in Japan. Her articles have been
for the most part on the subject of
women in labor. Her horr.e is in Tokyo,

where Mr. Tanaka is a professor at
Waseda University.
"Two other Stanford women whom
we saw while in Tokyo were Mrs. Wil
liam C. Colyer (Miriam Bryan, '15) and
Mrs. 11. Selden Brown (Jessie Hall.'l 3).
Mrs. Colvcr, with her husband and
daughter, has been living in the Orient
for several years, where Mr. Colyer is
at present connected with an American
Trading Company. Mrs. Brown has
been living for some time in Tokyo,
but lias, since our visit, returned to
America.
"Tokyo seems to have been made the
favored spot of former Stanfordites, for
it was also here that we met Miss S.
Ishihashi, sister of Professor Ishihashi,
who is now at Stanford. Miss Ishihashi
is at present teaching English at thd
Conservatory of Music and is visiting
classes at the Imperial University of
Tokyo.
"At Yokohama we found Mary Baker,
'13, who had just returned from a visit
to the United States. For seven years
Miss Baker was active in the work of
the Young Women's Christian Associa
tion at Yokohama, but since her trip
home has become interested in the
prison reform movement, which she is
now using her every effort to further.
"Helen Thoburn, '08, daughter of one
of Stanford's pioneer professors, greeted
us at Shanghai. She is acting as head
of the publicity work for the Young
Men's Christian Association in that city.
"In a delightful Korean home in the
mountain district of Unsan, we came
upon Mrs. Alfred Wellhavcn (Emelie
Stevenson, '00). Mr. Wellhavcn is at
present superintendent of the American
gold mines of Unsan, and they are set
tled in the heart of a beautiful region,
.where, with their two charming daugh
ters, they have been living for a num
ber of years.
"The trip home brought us in contact
with two more of Stanford's women
