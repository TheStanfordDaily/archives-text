### 
The women's annual Field Day will be condensed tomorrow into an after
noon of sports contests, beginning at 2 o'clock, with the interclass swimming
meet in Roble pool. Owing to the fact that the Spring Pageant took time
and interest from athletics in the first part of the spring season, he pro
gram of tomorrow's contests will not be as extensive as those of previous
years.
Since the production of the Pageant, however, the women have come out
for intensive practice in spring sports and have worked up teams that give
promise of being as strong as any of those in the past. In the swimming
meet, the four undergraduate classes and a squad of graduates will compete.
The winners of the preliminary class matches will contend for the University
championship in tennis. The four classes will shoot for the archery champion
ship.
The events will be run off as quickly as possible 011 account of the short
time allowed for them. The tennis finals and the archery shoot will both

Bailard, '22, who has been appointed Field Day tfrtmager.

vited will be served under the oaks back of Roble gymnasium. Women who
will receive any kind of athletic awards are especially urged to attend, as the

the best women swimmers for several

in the past.
Virginia Burks is the new star of
the junior squad. She has not been
in a meet at Stanford before and it
is expected that she will carry oft
several honors. Muriel Stewart swim
ming for the juniors, is one of their
best women. She has been practicing
steadily and is swimming in good
form. She is an old point winner for
the team and will undoubtedly come
out among the first tomorrow. Mild
red Hall is entering the plunge for
distance for the juniors.
The sophomore team is the weakest
of the five. The women who are sign
ed up to swim on it are Grace Stro
bel, Ruth Jameson, Frances Foster,

Frances Foster is their best swimmer
and will show up well in all of the

pected to carry off several honors.
The freshmen will not come out last
in the contest. Mabel McKibbin,
whose good form in swimming is not
able, is coming out for their squad.

determine the University tennis cham
pion. Tomorrow the four women who
have come up to the finals will com
pete with each other. Two prelimi
nary matches will be run off and the
winners of those will meet for the final
sets.
For the seniors, Margaret Young
love, Rebecca Shephard, and Marie

play in the finals tomorrow for the
seniors.
Virginia Burks is the successful
entrant for the juniors. She played
in the tournament with the University
of California in the early spring.
In the sophomore matches, Eliza
beth Peirce and Isabel Muzzey will

that they do not show unusual skill
with the bow must be taken into ac
count in this. The junior team is
small, but has some of the best arch

best records for the last two years.

Virginia Burks is the new star of
the junior squad. She has not been
in a meet at Stanford before and it
is expected that she will carry oft
several honors. Muriel Stewart swim
ming for the juniors, is one of their
best women. She has been practicing
steadily and is swimming in good
form. She is an old point winner for
the team and will undoubtedly come
out among the first tomorrow. Mild
red Hall is entering the plunge for
distance for the juniors.
The sophomore team is the weakest
of the five. The women who are sign
ed up to swim on it are Grace Stro
bel, Ruth Jameson, Frances Foster,
Charlotte Mayfleld, Helen Brant,
Helen Schardin, and Evelyn Howard.
Frances Foster is their best swimmer
and will show up well in all of the
events which she enters. She is ex
pected to carry off several honors.
The freshmen will not come out last
in the contest. Mabel McKibbin,
whose good form in swimming is not
able, is coming out for their squad.
Some of their other swimmers are
Mildred Burlingame, Elizabeth Sim
mons, Carolyn Strouse, and Margaret
Watson.
During the past week preliminary
tennis matches have been played off.
The sets have been between the con
testants from the separate classes.
Only singles games will be played in
this tournament as its purpose is to
determine the University tennis cham
pion. Tomorrow the four women who
have come up to the finals will com
pete with each other. Two prelimi
nary matches will be run off and the
winners of those will meet for the final
sets.
For the seniors, Margaret Young
love, Rebecca Shephard, and Marie
Lloyd have not yet played off their
preliminary matches. Margaret Young
love has played in both interclass and

intercollegiate competition and from
her record it is expected that she will
play in the finals tomorrow for the
seniors.
Virginia Burks is the successful
entrant for the juniors. She played
in the tournament with the University
of California in the early spring.
In the sophomore matches, Eliza
beth Peirce and Isabel Muzzey will

beth Peirce and Charlotte Mayfield will
tournament with California.

tournament will shoot forty-live ar
rows; fifteen from the fifty-foot dis
tance, fifteen from the forty-foot dis
tance, and fifteen from the thirty-foot
distance. Only those making a score
of 80* or more will be considered as
final contestants for the cup.
Wanda Leach and Evelyn Olsen will
shoot for the seniors. They were

that time Miss Leach ran up the high
est score which was made that day.

Mootie and Gertrude McLeod. The
first two of these shot with Mills and
placed in the tournament.
Among the archery teams, the sopho
mores have the largest number out and
on that account have a chance of
making the highest score. The fact
that they do not show unusual skill
with the bow must be taken into ac
count in this. The junior team is
small, but has some of the best arch
ers who have consistently made the
best records for the last two years.
The women's annual Field Day will be condensed tomorrow into an after
noon of sports contests, beginning at 2 o'clock, with the interclass swimming

gram of tomorrow's contests will not be as extensive as those of previous
years.

for intensive practice in spring sports and have worked up teams that give
promise of being as strong as any of those in the past. In the swimming
meet, the four undergraduate classes and a squad of graduates will compete.
The winners of the preliminary class matches will contend for the University
championship in tennis. The four classes will shoot for the archery champion
ship.

vited will be served under the oaks back of Roble gymnasium. Women who
will receive any kind of athletic awards are especially urged to attend, as the

events have not been definitely settled.
Mildred Maurer, who has been one of
the best women swimmers for several
years, wil\ enter for the graduate

plunge for distance. Edith Pasmore
is also signed up to swim for the
graduates.
On the senior team are Carey Bail
