# WOMEN WILL OBSERVE ANNUAL FIELD DAY TOMORROW BY SPORTS PROGRAM
## Interclass Swimming Meet, Tennis Finals And Archery Shoot Will Be Followed By Picnic Supper 
### 
The women's annual Field Day will be condensed tomorrow into an after
noon of sports contests, beginning at 2 o'clock, with the interclass swimming
meet in Roble pool. Owing to the fact that the Spring Pageant took time
and interest from athletics in the first part of the spring season, he pro
gram of tomorrow's contests will not be as extensive as those of previous
years.
Since the production of the Pageant, however, the women have come out
for intensive practice in spring sports and have worked up teams that give
promise of being as strong as any of those in the past. In the swimming
meet, the four undergraduate classes and a squad of graduates will compete.
The winners of the preliminary class matches will contend for the University
championship in tennis. The four classes will shoot for the archery champion
ship.
The events will be run off as quickly as possible 011 account of the short
time allowed for them. The tennis finals and the archery shoot will both
commence promptly at 3:30, according to the announcement made by Carey
Bailard, '22, who has been appointed Field Day tfrtmager.
In the evening a supper to which all the women in the University are in
vited will be served under the oaks back of Roble gymnasium. Women who
will receive any kind of athletic awards are especially urged to attend, as the
awards will be made at that time. A picnic supper in the -evening is an
entirely now departure in the program for Field Day. In the past years
luncheon has always been served at noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
