# Librarian Agrees That Free Ink Will Give Library a Line
## 
### 
You have seen a bread-line, a theater
line, and a registration line, but you
have never seen an ink line. No, this
isn't a mark that a pen makes when it
is drawn over a piece of paper, but a lot
of people standing in line to fill their
fountain pens.
About three years ago the Stanford
Bookstore furnished ink free to the stu
dents, but 011 account of crowded con
ditions and other inconveniences which
the ink line caused, the Bookstore was
forced to give up this plan. Two weeks
ago the Library offered to furnish a
place for the ink line if the Bookstore
would furnish the ink.
A small closet on the right side of the
entrance to the Hoover War Library
has been equipped for this purpose. A
shelf, built on two sides of the closet,
contains four drawers, each holding a
bowl of ink which fits under the four
openings cut in the tin-covered surface
of the ledge. This free supply of ink
will probably do away with the brilliant
shades of green and violet that now dec
oratc many notebooks. And, as Mr.
Clark, the Librarian, says, "With this
added attraction some students will see
the inside of the Library for the first
time."
