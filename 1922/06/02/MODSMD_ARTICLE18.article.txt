# THE 						WOMEN'S EDITION
## 
### 
Again the I'ink Sheet greets the campus! The
Women's Edition, the long accepted custom of the
Daily Palo Alto, the annual acknowledgment of
feminine supremacy, is the sole yearly one hundred
per cent journalistic output of the women. On this
day the entire editorial management of the Daily is
assumed by the women members of the staff and
every masculine element is eliminated from the sheet.
It is but once a year that the smoke clouds of the
office give way to undefiled air and the paper goes to
press without the noisy jargon of masculine voices:
Jo the men the Pink Sheet means a holiday; to
the women, twenty-four hours of perfect content
ment. It is with pleasure that we extend our thanks
to the men of the staff for their non-appearance
upon thisâ€”our day of days.
