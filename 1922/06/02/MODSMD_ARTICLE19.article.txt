# WOMEN'S FIELD DAY
## 
### 
A successful year for women's athletics comes to
a close with the final participation in swimming,
archery, and tennis tomorrow. Intercollegiate com
petition in all major sports as well as interciass meets
and the inauguration of a new activity, the Spring-
Pageant, under the auspices of the Women's Ath
letic Association, is the record for the year.
Tomorrow's Field Day will differ from previous
meets both in length of time and number of events.
Owing to the amount of time required of the women
to practice and produce the Pageant it was advisable
to allot a shorter time to the event. Instead of a
complete day devoted to sports, competition will be-
at 2 o'clock with the swimming meet. Archery
and.tennis matches will follow and in the evening a
picnic supper will be served under the oaks near
Roble Gymnasium and awards will be made at this
time.
This year has seen the completion of new tennis
courts and new athletic fields for every sport. A
provision for the apportionment of the second mil
lion of the endowment fund will care for a new
women's gymnasium. The large number of students
enrolled for athletic work is ample testimony of the
need for these facilities.
Complete co-operation of the members of every
team was necessary for a successful season. This
same co-operation of the women made the Pageant
a success and a similar showing in attendance at the
meet tomorrow will complete a satisfactory year.
Field Day is one of the few all-women's affairs. It
merits your support.
