The contest for the Queen of the
Children's Circus and '"Horse Show,
which is to be given in Menlo Park
June 10, for the benefit of the Con
valescent Home, will close June 3, ac
cording to Mrs. Augustus Taylor,
chairman of the queen committee.
Of the twenty-six entrants in the
"Polly of the Circus" contest, Sibyl
Coryell is in the lead with more than a
thousand votes. The three contestants
next in rank arc Louise Halm, Kath
erine Doyle, and Evelyn J aylor all
with approximately the same number of
votes.
Rehearsals have been held each
Wednesday and Saturday for the past
month, and, beginning June 7, there will
be a complete rehearsal every day until
the final performance.
The Fireman's Band from San Fran
cisco. has been obtained through Fire
Captain Ed Lamb to furnish the music
for the Circus. Owing to a conflicting
engagement, the Stanford Band was un
able to accept tho invitation to play.
The field on the A. G. C. llahn estate
has been changed into a regular circus
ground under Mrs. Timothy Hopkins'
supervision. A quarter-mile circular
race track was surveyed and laid out,
and within this a large sawdust ring
was made. Ihe University loaned ten
sections of portable bleachers, which
were set up on the field by Stanford
students. Four and six-seat boxes have
been arranged at one /tnd of the field
under the oak trees. Booths are being
erected which will be used for the sale
of candy, ice cream, and cold drinks.
Among the events to take place on
the quarter-mile track is a Roman race
by Stanford riders. The boys and girls
of Menlo and Palo Alto will take part
in the pony races. Four- tiny girls in
ballet costumes will give an exhibition
of "real circus riding."
Several trick horses will perform, one
of which is F. W. Frehe's "Sadie," a
former star of the Orpheum stage. Rin
tintin, Mrs. Anderson's police dog, will
be one of the show features. Rintintin
was born in the trenches of France dur
ing the war, and, after a brilliant war
record, became a motion picture star.
This is the second Circus and Horse
Show to be given by the Women's Aux
iliary for the benefit of the Stanford
Convalescent Home. Last year $10,000
was added to the endowment fund for
the Convalescent Home, and the Aux
iliary hopes that this year's performance
will be an even greater financial suc
cess. An addition is now being built
to the Convalescent Home, and a resi
dent nurse has been engaged. Later,
when the equipment has been increased,
two student nurses will be kept at the
Home* to care for the sick children.
Tickets for the Circus are on sale at
the Stanford Bookstore. Admission for
adults is $1, and for children 50 cents.
