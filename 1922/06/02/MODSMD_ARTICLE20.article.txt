# WOMEN AND ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
For some months the battle cry of campus editors
has been "too many activities." The general con
sensus of opinion seems to be that the campus is
over-organized, that there is too much besides aca
demic work to occupy students.
The difficulty in regard to women's activities is
not that there are too many activities but that there
are too few competitors for them. An analysis of
the membership of women's honor societies and
other organizations, with the possible exception of
athletics, will show, less than fifty per cent of the
women in participation.
There is a countless repetition of names on such
roles which in all probability would not be there if
the competition were keener. A woman with ability
in one particular line can easily win recognition in
another field with a passable showing, because of the
lack of material. The first evidence of ability and
willingness to accept responsibility brings a shower
of committee and organization work and the partici
pant advances easily onward, instead of in the face
of competition and the inevitable more difficult
work.
Student activities serve to bring the members of
a student lxxly into contact with the administration,

the faculty, and fellow students. They increase in
terest in University life and keep participants in
touch with all campus movements.
The fault with women's activities at the present
tune lies not in the number but in the attitude of the
women as a whole. The prevailing tendency is to
remain in the background and let someone else do
the work. The existing activities apportioned
among the five hundred women students can work
a hardship upon none, but will serve to make a better
informed and better working group. The respon
sibility lies with the individual woman.
