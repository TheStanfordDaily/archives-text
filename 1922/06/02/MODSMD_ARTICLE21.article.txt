SIGH—CHOLOGY
Would she think that a year at college had changed him?

Wouldn't Hhe think that he was a real man now?
No. —His mother thought he was her same baby boy.

DO YOU KNOW
Why did Mint Howell?
Where did Phil Landis?
Why was George Green?
What makes "June" Darling?

CALLING 'EM NAMES
They're bored, blase, they seldom smile,
Cigarettes they smoke in perfect style.
They are called "snakes"
At teas they know just what to do,
Soft words to all the girls they coo.
They are called "tea-hounds."
They tell her her frown cuts their heart like a
knife,
They tell her her smile is their very life.
Women call them "fools."
They are.
* * *
If you can't manage the clothes-press, you'd better
let the wash-stand.
* * m
"You broke the record," shouted the clerk as he picked
up two pieces of the newest Victrola fox-trot.
* * *
SHE WAS "ALL LIT UP"
Her liair reflects the light that is seen,
I think she uses brilliantine.
Her eyes like stars at evening gleam;
Drug store art is quite the scheme.
Her sunshine smile would charm a czar.
It's copied from a movie star.
Her teeth are set like pearls in two rows
She even has a shiny nose.
• » •
She was furious. She gnashed her teeth. She stamp
ed her feet. She started to slam her books on the
ground, but there were no men around to pick them up
for her. She started to tear her hair, and then re
membered that she couldn't afford a new hair-net. She
started to bite her lip, but decided that she wasn't
hungry for lip-stick. So she didn't do anything but
talk about it and tell everybody else about it. About
what? Oh, she thought her picture in the 1923 Quad
was terrible.

Why is "Adam and Eva" the Senior Farce? Of course
it is the oldest story, but we didn't expect it to rate the
highest class.
* m •
Still the story of Adam and Eva can be modernized
for the play. The Snake will tempt Eva with a date.
* • *
If Adam is a lemon, you can't blame Eva fo rwanting
to try some other fruit in the garden.

"Flunking Out" is nothing now. They started ex
pelling in Adam and Eva's time.

They're bored, blase, they seldom smile,
Cigarettes they smoke in perfect style.
They are called "snakes"
At teas they know just what to do,
Soft words to all the girls they coo.
They are called "tea-hounds."
They tell her her frown cuts their heart like a

They tell her her smile is their very life.
Women call them "fools."

started to bite her lip, but decided that she wasn't
hungry for lip-stick. So she didn't do anything but
talk about it and tell everybody else about it. About
