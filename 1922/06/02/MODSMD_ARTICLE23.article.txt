# ADVICE TO COLLEGE WOMEN IN INDUSTRY GIVEN BY W.G. BEACH
## 
### 
The first thing to do when studying
industrial conditions is to learn the state
laws governing labor and then see if
the laws are enforced. This was the
gist of Professor W. G. Beach's talk
at the open meeting of Women's Eco
nomics Club yesterday in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Professor Beach believes that a stu
dent should not say she is a college
woman if she wishes to establish sym
pathetic relations with her industrial fel
low workmen." Women in industry have
not yet overcome their strong prejudices
against and fear of college women. The
student should also become a member
of the trades union, it there is one, where
she is working, as she will be able in
this way to gain the confidence of the
industrial women.
A class for the study of industrial
problems has been organized at Stanford
by the Women's Economics Club, the
Economics department,- and the Y. W.
C. A. All women in the University who
are planning to work during the sum
mer and who are interested in the study
of industrial conditions arc invited to
join the class and add their experiences
to the discussion.
