## Miss Carey Bailard Tells Of W.A.A. Conference 
### 
"Sectional meetings of the Women's
Athletic Associations such as was held
at [he University of Oregon in the mid
dle of May offer a chance for the inter
change of ideas and bring the vafious
universities much closer together," said
Carey Bailard, '22, in speaking of the
work done at the recent conference of
the Western Section of the National
Women's Athletic Association. Miss
1 iailard attended the conference in her
capacity of president of the Stanford
\V. A. A. The other delegates from
Stanford were Eunice Biddle, '24, presi
dent W. A. A. for the coming year, and
Miss Helen Bunting, head of the Wo
men's Physical Training Department and
faculty representative on W. A. A.
"Besides the mere interchange of
ideas, this meeting brought out unusual
features in women's athletics at several
of the colleges. The University of Ore
gon has a well-established system of in
tramural atliletics for the women which
corresponds almost exactly to the intra
mural 'contests of the men at Stanford.
At Oregon every house and dormitory
section has ics own team and a large
amount of enthusiasm is shown in the
interhouse meets. This brings almost
every woman in the university out for at
least one sport. Oregon is the only
school in the West which has this sys
tem."
Miss Bailard says that another good
coming from these meetings is the fact
that people attend them who could*
never go to the national conventions and
consequently more institutions are able
to enter actively in the work of the
Women's Athletic Association.
One of the main problems of the con
ference was to standardize the rules for
the various sports. After a discussion as
to how each university manages the ath
letic contests and how well the plan of
each has succeeded the delegates had
a basis for judgment. As a result of one
of these discussions, a committee was ap
pointed to draw up standardized swim
ming rules. Mrs. Greta Brandsten,
swimming instructor, is a member of
Ibis board.
The standardization of point systems
fur making athletic awards was the sub
ject of another talk. It was thought

necessary to have a general basis for
giving points, not only for the sake of
having a set system, but also to enable
a woman transfering from one univer
sity to another to be able to transfer her
athletic points also.
"A considerable portion of one of the
meetings was taken up with a discussion
of intercollegiate athletics," said Miss
Bailard. "There is a national ruling
that there shall be no varsity intercol
legiate contests. It was found that the
University of Washington and O. A. C.
had been violating this and had been
playing varsity games with each other.
As this was absolutely against rules,
those universities were asked to discon
tinue the practice.
"Several universities d.id not alto
gether approve of any form of intercol
legiate contests. These were schools
that are located too far apart to take
advantage of such meets and did not
realize their possibilities. With short
distance between Mills, California, and
Stanford explained, the conference
readily agreed that our situation is
unique and that intercollegiate contests
would be profitable."
Stanford was elected president of the
Western Section for next year. The
conference will meet at Stanford next
year instead of in two years, as is the
custom, owing to the fact that the na
tional convention will be at the Univer
sity of California next year and the
Western Section meeting will be mostly
taken up in preparations for the larger
meeting. The University of Oregon was
elected corresponding secretary.
An executive committee, consisting of
the president, corresponding secretary,
and representatives from Pomona and
the University of Montana, was appoint
ed to draw up a constitution before the
meeting next year.

pointed to draw up standardized swim
ming rules. Mrs. Greta Brandsten,
swimming instructor, is a member of
Ibis board.
The standardization of point systems
fur making athletic awards was the sub
ject of another talk. It was thought

necessary to have a general basis for
giving points, not only for the sake of
having a set system, but also to enable
a woman transfering from one univer
sity to another to be able to transfer her
athletic points also.
"A considerable portion of one of the
meetings was taken up with a discussion
of intercollegiate athletics," said Miss
Bailard. "There is a national ruling
that there shall be no varsity intercol
legiate contests. It was found that the
University of Washington and O. A. C.
had been violating this and had been
playing varsity games with each other.
As this was absolutely against rules,
those universities were asked to discon
tinue the practice.
"Several universities d.id not alto
gether approve of any form of intercol
legiate contests. These were schools
that are located too far apart to take
advantage of such meets and did not
realize their possibilities. With short
distance between Mills, California, and
Stanford explained, the conference
readily agreed that our situation is
unique and that intercollegiate contests
would be profitable."
Stanford was elected president of the
Western Section for next year. The
conference will meet at Stanford next
year instead of in two years, as is the
custom, owing to the fact that the na
tional convention will be at the Univer
sity of California next year and the
Western Section meeting will be mostly
taken up in preparations for the larger
meeting. The University of Oregon was
elected corresponding secretary.
An executive committee, consisting of
the president, corresponding secretary,
and representatives from Pomona and
the University of Montana, was appoint
ed to draw up a constitution before the
meeting next year.

"Sectional meetings of the Women's
Athletic Associations such as was held
at [he University of Oregon in the mid
dle of May offer a chance for the inter
change of ideas and bring the vafious
universities much closer together," said
Carey Bailard, '22, in speaking of the
work done at the recent conference of
the Western Section of the National
Women's Athletic Association. Miss
1 iailard attended the conference in her
capacity of president of the Stanford
\V. A. A. The other delegates from
Stanford were Eunice Biddle, '24, presi
dent W. A. A. for the coming year, and
Miss Helen Bunting, head of the Wo
men's Physical Training Department and
faculty representative on W. A. A.
"Besides the mere interchange of
ideas, this meeting brought out unusual
features in women's athletics at several
of the colleges. The University of Ore
gon has a well-established system of in
tramural atliletics for the women which
corresponds almost exactly to the intra
mural 'contests of the men at Stanford.
At Oregon every house and dormitory
section has ics own team and a large
amount of enthusiasm is shown in the
interhouse meets. This brings almost
every woman in the university out for at
least one sport. Oregon is the only
school in the West which has this sys
tem."
Miss Bailard says that another good
coming from these meetings is the fact
that people attend them who could*
never go to the national conventions and
consequently more institutions are able
to enter actively in the work of the
Women's Athletic Association.
One of the main problems of the con
ference was to standardize the rules for
the various sports. After a discussion as
to how each university manages the ath
letic contests and how well the plan of
each has succeeded the delegates had
a basis for judgment. As a result of one
of these discussions, a committee was ap
pointed to draw up standardized swim
ming rules. Mrs. Greta Brandsten,
