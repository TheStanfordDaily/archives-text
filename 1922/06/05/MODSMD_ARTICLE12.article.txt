# FIRST STADIUM OPERA IS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL
## "I'Pagliacci" Distinguished By Singing Of Three Famous Stars 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Just as pleasing to the eye as to the ear was the production of Leonca
vallo's "J'Pagliacci" with ballet divertissement which opened the grand opera
season in the Stanford Stadium last Saturday night. From the first notes of
the enlarged symphony orchestra, to the singing of three world-famous
operatic stars, and ending with the glitter and superb lighting effects on Natale
Carossio's well-trained ballet of fifty, the production was a complete suc
cess. People were surprised and pleased at the completeness with which
everything had been planned and carried out. "Wonderful" was thier un
animous commentation on this, the initial of a series of novelly-produced
operas in the music annals of the West.
"I'Pagliacci" was indeed qualified to produce impression and its theme
was so simple and straightforward that it made an excellent subject for an
opera. The story was peculiarly Italian in its nature centering around the

actions of a troupe of wandering actors
which are so common in southern
Italy. The scene was laid in humble
life; the story hinged on love and
murder. The opera had merits of
brevity, ingenuity, conciseness, and
swift 'action, which brought it to a
climax with a great tragic power.
As a whole, the opera was melodi
ous, forceful and intensely dramatic,
and was without a dull moment from
the time the prologue was sung by
Tonio to the last dispairing outcry of
Canio upon which the opera ended.
Leoncavallo's strength, however, seem
ed to line in his orchestral work
which often was impassioned and
strongly dramatic. In the prologue,
there was a wonderful piece of music,
and the tragic element seemed to be
apparent almost at once, so that the
rest of the action merely moved
swiftly onto the fearful denouement.
Tre prologue's music helped admir
ably to picture the activity in which
the characters of the play were soon
to be thrown.
After this, the actual play began,
and as score after scores of peasants
in bright and colorful costumes trooped
upon the stage, the audience realized
the magniture of the production. When
Canio look leave of his wife Nedda
before the flaunting peasants, Nedda
soon cast aside her evil forbodings and
sang with unsurpassing harmony and
sweetness. Silvio, her peasant lover,
entreated Nedda to leave Aanino to
take flight with him, and their duet
was wonderful in its style and beauty.
Act two brought the troupe's come
dy which was to have a realistic and
bloody ending. The villagers gathered
in front of the stage, and the comedy
began to the music of a graceful
minuet as .Nedda, playing the part of
Columbine, tripped merrily about the
floor in the act of setting the table
for the banquet with her lover, Har
lequin in the play. Beppo, taking
the lover's role, sang a serenade under
her window and it was a pretty mea
sure. When Toddeo entered in mock
alarm to tell of the coming of Colum
bine's husband, Canio in real life,
the music's tripping dance steps gave
way to sinister mutterings in keeping
with Canio's outbursts. The action
was swift and furious as death was
meted out by Canio to both his wife
and Silvio who tried to aid her, which
was in decided contrast to the quiet
aftermath when Canio, limp and
broken-hearted, standing over his vic
tims, muttered to the terrorized and
horrified peasants, "Go; the farce is
ended." The whole situation, being
so effectively acted and sung brought
the opera to a swift and dynamic con
clusion.
Of first and primary importance to
"ITagliacci's" success was the engage
ment of three world-famous grand
opera stars. Giovanni Martinelli, play
ing the role of Canio which was -one
of the roles in which the late Enrico
Caruso was famed, secured tremendous
ovations. From his first appearance
when the sadness of the voice indi
cated his difficulty in having to play

a farcial role in tlie troupe's play which
in reality was bitter tragedy to him, to
his remonstrater fury at the end of the
second act, Martinelli was effective.
His actions and the moderations of his
voice were consistent so that the deep
tragic emotions which he wished to
express were readily realized by his
audience.
Bianca Saroya playing the part of
Nedda, was all that had been expected
of her. Having recently returned from
European capitals where she had
made success after success in operatic
circles, she secured for herself more
glory in the first of Western open-air
operatic performances.
Vicente Ballester, baritone of the
Chicago Opera Association, took the
role of Toddeo, the Fool, and received
a long and hearty applause after hav
ing sung effectively the prologue to
the opera. Silvio, Nedda's lover as
played by Marsden Argall, '23, was
sung well, but his actions were a
little rigid.
