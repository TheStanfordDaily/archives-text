# BETA THETA PI LEADS INTRAMURAL BASEBALL
## 
### 
Beta Theta Pi and Phi Delta Theta
emerged victorious from Friday after
noon's card of intramural baseball, the
former taking a 7 to 2 game from Kap
pa Sigma while the latter was troun
cing Alpha Delta by a 6 to 5 score.
The conventional extra inning game
was staged by the Phi Delta Theta
and Alphi Delta Phi combination, and
the surprise of the series, Kappa Sig
ma's defeat. Beta Theta Pi, now at
the top of the perecntage column,
seems to be the "dark horse" of the
season. Kappa Sigma, Alpha Delta
Phi, and Phi Delta Theta are tied for
second place with .500 per cent, and
Sigma Chi brings up the rear with one
defeat and no victories.
Phi Delta Theta showed a great
come-back in its eight-inning defeat
of Alpha Delta Phi. In the first in
ning, two consecutive hits coupled with
a stolen base gave Alpha Delta Phi
one run, and three more registered in
the second on two singles, an over
throw at fiirst base, and a double by
Janssen. In the third, Phi Delta
Theta was off to a start when Stark
and Langford singled, Mcllose was
safe on an unsuccessful fielder'
choice, Piggott. contributed a sacrifice
fly, and Kraft singled. Both teams
went down in order at their first at
tempts at extra innings, but in the
last half of the eighth, Playter, first
man up for Phi Delta Theta, broke
the game wide open by driving a home
run into deep right field.
Chandler and Kraft handled the ball
for Phi Delta Theta, wit'll Neer, Loom
is, and Wideman as the Alpha Delta
■Phi battery. The hits were equally
divided with ten blows to the credit
of either team.
Seven, runs at the expense of Kappa
Sigma is something of an achievement,
and holding these hitherto undefeated
sluggers to a pair of lonely tallies is
even more so. So far as statistics go,
Kappa Sip'Qia out-liit < their opponents
by eight hits to six, but the Beta
Theta Pi hits came when they counted,
and that is what wins ball games.
