### 
Rumors of a "dark horse" in the race

executive office by either a "write in"
vote or a white ballot.
The finally tally which will be taken
Wednesday will determine the result of
one of the most peculiarly conducted
campaigns in the history of student
body elections at Stanford. Interest,
which appeared at a low ebb during the
first two days of nominations, has in
creased daily until at the present time
indications point to one of the most
closely contested elections in years.

were as follows: Student body: Vice
president, Tom Irwin; secretary,
Ted Bowen; Men's Council, Walt
Hales, Orlo Hayes, Harry J. Borba,
