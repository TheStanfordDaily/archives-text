Overfeldt has a fast serve which
he follows to the net. His best shot
is a forehand drive which he uses
effectively, together with a dangerous
backhand stroke. Williard is a steady
and accurate player. He has a deceiv
ing top stroke and he uses a cross-court
shot a great deal.
Logan prefers to play from the back
court but when he does take the net
he is an effective vollier. His ser
vice is fast with a good deal of top,
and he favors his forehand because
of a weak backhand stroke. M-"Hose
relies *011 steady playing and follow
ing the-ball to the net,Â«\vhere he shows
up to the best advantage. His back
hand is weak, and he uses the chop
strokes very little.

Leeds defeated Ford Tussins, 6-4, 4-6,
6-4. The winner of the match between
