# SENIORS AND THE ENDOWMENT
## 
### 
President Taylor's announcement that the 1922
class will come across one huudred per cent in the
endowment drove must be carried out in full. The
seniors this year have not taken on their shoulders
any of the insurance plans that have bothered the
last two classes and have only undertaken to do
their part in the endowment drive. It has been the
-effort of the committees to get the response from
all of the students, and for most part this has met
with success. In the case of the seniors, there is
the added weight of the one hundred per cent con
tribution being a class proposition as well as one
for which everyone with the good of Stanford at
heart is working.
If the seniors can come across as a class and at
the final reckoning have a really entire subscription
to the endowment, the class may feel proud that it
lias accomplished the last thing it has tried in col
lege and has done the job up well.
