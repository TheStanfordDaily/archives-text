# THERE IS A LIMIT

Hazing has been brought to the attention of the
Men's Council again with the complaint of a mother
that one of her boys was taken out and severely
beaten up by several other students. Disguises were
worn and were so effective that the one injured did
not recognize any of his captors.
We do not hold discipline in disfavor at all. But
there is a limit of reason to everything, and this is
a place where lack of good judgment has caused a
lot of trouble which may or may not reflect on the
University. The whole thing is a "hangover" from
the festivities at the Lake held some months ago.
Very likely there was in this second attack nothing
more than a desire by several to see a boy badly
scared by a number of tormentors, and so he was
seized again and taken out for a paddling.
It is strange to note that the ones being the prime
movers in the "ultra discipline" set are those who
last year put on the biggest howls when their turn
came to take the walloping or the water cure. If
the members of the late "swat fest" are found, they
will be granted leaves at once, and they won't have
'to get doctor's certificates, either.
