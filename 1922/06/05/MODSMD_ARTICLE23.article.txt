A way to avoid final exes
Is to head for Missouri or Texas;
BUT
Neither shotguns nor flowers
Would rake in the hours
And its scarceness of hours that wrecks us.

Cabbage Schedule for Finals. (May be adopted by the
faculty—about the same time as a bootleggers' stand is
allowed in the post office.)
1. All 8 o'clocks, whether on Tuesday or Thursday,
to be held next year 011 Feb. 29.
2. All 9 o'clocks except those which come on Sun
day and Labor Day to have final exes on the same day
the Chinese New Year is observed at the North Pole.
3. All 10 o'clocks and 11 o'clocks to have finals from
12 to 1 p.m., with an hour off for lunch.
4. No finals for afternoon classes, except when class
by majority vote, and retified by a 3-4 vote of the
rest of the University, decides to have one anyway.
* * •
The Senior Farce is advertised to "make you forget
the finals —afterwards.".. It is said that a bite from a
scorpion will do the same thing... Must be a powerful
play.
* * *
TRAINING RULES FOR FINALS
1. Stay up every night until 12 playing poker. This
will give you good practice in drawing your conclu
sions. Observe the honor system and play straight(s).
2. Call everybody you meet on the Quad by their
first name. If you don't know their first name, the
middle one will do. This is a valuable aid to the
memory.
3. Organize the little game known as "passing the
x's". Line five or six men around in a circle, and pass
a few ten dollar bills from hand to hand. Don't use
your own money—you might get x-cited.
4. To acquire some good experience with the pen,
hurl a brick through the police officer's front window.
Arrange with the judge to let you out for finals instead
of extracting a fine.

Following the thr-r-r-rilling and bl-l-l-lood-curdling
Mixed bout Saturday night between boxer and wrestler,
suggestions have arisen for a series of mixed bouts,
something like as follows:
» * •
Postman vs. messenger boy. Contestant taking the
longest time to circle around room wins stop watch.
Prof. vs. instructor. Given set of papers, to see which
can mark the lowest in five minutes' time. Winner to
receive unqualified disapproval.
Snake vs. Rough. Meanest remark within three min
utes gets first prize. Second meanest remark gets
second prize, etc.

"Was that the Hotel Atlas you stopped at last night? '

they got the chance."

Burglar—Hey! Get out of the chimney!
Bungler—Gwan; you said to leave by the fire escape.

In the college world there is a persistent belief that
Yale men who are members of the famous Skull and
Bones society are bound by awful oath to leave the room
whenever the sacred name of their society is mentioned.
Our story, then, concerns an Old Times of Naught Nix,
who in course of time arrived at the stage where mat
rimony was imminent.
He had arranged a dignified Yale discourse, beginning
with "darling-I-love-you-I-cannot-live-without-you," and
was on his knees before his fair Priscilla. Then, through
a door, came the grating voice of the second maid, in
converse with the butler.
"I give you my woid, Perkins," came the baneful ac
cents. "Katie was that wasted away with consumption
that there wasn't nothing left to her but a skull and
bones."
What could a Yale man do? He scrambled to his
feet, looked wildly about, and dashed for the door. Next
day Priscilla had all the Yale locks removed from her
effects, and subsequetnly married a graduate of the
University of Fu-chow. —W.L.W.

Following the thr-r-r-rilling and bl-l-l-lood-curdling
Mixed bout Saturday night between boxer and wrestler,
suggestions have arisen for a series of mixed bouts,
something like as follows:

Postman vs. messenger boy. Contestant taking the
longest time to circle around room wins stop watch.
Prof. vs. instructor. Given set of papers, to see which
can mark the lowest in five minutes' time. Winner to
receive unqualified disapproval.

second prize, etc.

In the college world there is a persistent belief that
Yale men who are members of the famous Skull and
Bones society are bound by awful oath to leave the room
whenever the sacred name of their society is mentioned.
Our story, then, concerns an Old Times of Naught Nix,
who in course of time arrived at the stage where mat
rimony was imminent.
He had arranged a dignified Yale discourse, beginning
with "darling-I-love-you-I-cannot-live-without-you," and
was on his knees before his fair Priscilla. Then, through
a door, came the grating voice of the second maid, in
converse with the butler.
"I give you my woid, Perkins," came the baneful ac
cents. "Katie was that wasted away with consumption
that there wasn't nothing left to her but a skull and
bones."
What could a Yale man do? He scrambled to his
feet, looked wildly about, and dashed for the door. Next
day Priscilla had all the Yale locks removed from her
effects, and subsequetnly married a graduate of the
University of Fu-chow. —W.L.W.

1. All 8 o'clocks, whether on Tuesday or Thursday,
to be held next year 011 Feb. 29.
2. All 9 o'clocks except those which come on Sun
day and Labor Day to have final exes on the same day

by majority vote, and retified by a 3-4 vote of the

TRAINING RULES FOR FINALS
1. Stay up every night until 12 playing poker. This
will give you good practice in drawing your conclu

2. Call everybody you meet on the Quad by their
first name. If you don't know their first name, the
middle one will do. This is a valuable aid to the
memory.
3. Organize the little game known as "passing the
x's". Line five or six men around in a circle, and pass
a few ten dollar bills from hand to hand. Don't use

EX . "X"="UN KNOWN."
Carl Shoup, Monday Conductor,
Hal Rorke, Tuesday Dispatcher.
Phil Newill, Wednesday Engineer.
Alike Ely, Thursday Mucker
Henry Mack, In Friday Caboost
A way to avoid final exes
Is to head for Missouri or Texas;
BUT
Neither shotguns nor flowers
Would rake in the hours
And its scarceness of hours that wrecks us.

Cabbage Schedule for Finals. (May be adopted by the
faculty—about the same time as a bootleggers' stand is
allowed in the post office.)
1. All 8 o'clocks, whether on Tuesday or Thursday,
to be held next year 011 Feb. 29.
2. All 9 o'clocks except those which come on Sun
day and Labor Day to have final exes on the same day
the Chinese New Year is observed at the North Pole.
3. All 10 o'clocks and 11 o'clocks to have finals from
12 to 1 p.m., with an hour off for lunch.
4. No finals for afternoon classes, except when class
by majority vote, and retified by a 3-4 vote of the
rest of the University, decides to have one anyway.

The Senior Farce is advertised to "make you forget
the finals —afterwards.".. It is said that a bite from a
scorpion will do the same thing... Must be a powerful
play.

TRAINING RULES FOR FINALS
1. Stay up every night until 12 playing poker. This
will give you good practice in drawing your conclu
sions. Observe the honor system and play straight(s).
2. Call everybody you meet on the Quad by their
first name. If you don't know their first name, the
middle one will do. This is a valuable aid to the
memory.
3. Organize the little game known as "passing the
x's". Line five or six men around in a circle, and pass
a few ten dollar bills from hand to hand. Don't use
your own money—you might get x-cited.
4. To acquire some good experience with the pen,
hurl a brick through the police officer's front window.
Arrange with the judge to let you out for finals instead
of extracting a fine.

Following the thr-r-r-rilling and bl-l-l-lood-curdling
Mixed bout Saturday night between boxer and wrestler,
suggestions have arisen for a series of mixed bouts,
something like as follows:
» * •
Postman vs. messenger boy. Contestant taking the
longest time to circle around room wins stop watch.
Prof. vs. instructor. Given set of papers, to see which
can mark the lowest in five minutes' time. Winner to
receive unqualified disapproval.
Snake vs. Rough. Meanest remark within three min
utes gets first prize. Second meanest remark gets
second prize, etc.

"Was that the Hotel Atlas you stopped at last night? '
."It must have been. They'd hold the wrold up if
they got the chance."

Burglar—Hey! Get out of the chimney!
Bungler—Gwan; you said to leave by the fire escape.

In the college world there is a persistent belief that
Yale men who are members of the famous Skull and
Bones society are bound by awful oath to leave the room
whenever the sacred name of their society is mentioned.
Our story, then, concerns an Old Times of Naught Nix,
who in course of time arrived at the stage where mat
rimony was imminent.
He had arranged a dignified Yale discourse, beginning
with "darling-I-love-you-I-cannot-live-without-you," and
was on his knees before his fair Priscilla. Then, through
a door, came the grating voice of the second maid, in
converse with the butler.
"I give you my woid, Perkins," came the baneful ac
cents. "Katie was that wasted away with consumption
that there wasn't nothing left to her but a skull and
bones."
What could a Yale man do? He scrambled to his
feet, looked wildly about, and dashed for the door. Next
day Priscilla had all the Yale locks removed from her
effects, and subsequetnly married a graduate of the
University of Fu-chow. —W.L.W.
