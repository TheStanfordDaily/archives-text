## 
### 
Stanford should not compete in the
I. C. A. A. A. A., suggests W. F. Lei
ser, '21, in the June Pictorial, out
Wednesday. Cambridge is too far east
the article argues, and Stanford teams
should take part only in the Pacific
Coast Conference meet, and perhaps
the N. C. A. A. at Chicago. The Chica
go meet, according to "Dink" Temple
ton, will be the big national track
contest of the future.
"Psycho-Analyzing the Extra-Curri
cular Activity Student" is the some
what opaque title of Tom Kleckner's
final article in the Pictorial. The ana
lysis considers three types of "active"
students —those who try hard but don't
make the grade; those who rise from
the ranks and make good in spite of
themselves; and finally, the high
school heroes who always were good,
and know it. Kleckner takes a com
plete analysis of the last group, and
explains their method of getting into
the public eye, and how they can best
be gotten out without impairing the
eyesight.
Dean Yost has been at Stanford a
year, during which time she has had
a chance to observe Stanford students,
men and women, and compare them
with those of eastern colleges. This
she does, in an interview with Mary
Jane Clark, '22. How Stanford women
differ from women of eastern co-edu
cational colleges, and from eastern
women's colleges, it set forth in the
coming Pictorial.
Classes today have no class spirit,
declares B. C. Wohlford, '18. This
condition, he says, will be remedied
by the freshman dormitory plan, which
makes May pledging a necessity. By
keeping the new students together in
one dormitory for a year, with no
pledging allowed until May, u class
spirit on esprit de corps, is developed
which is not visible today when mem
bers of the freshman classes are at
once scattered over the campus.
