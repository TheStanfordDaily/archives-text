in this opera, Saturday.
"Faust" has been declared the most
popular opera which has been written
in the last fifty years, its peculiar
charm lying in its melody and har
mony. |
The first act is in the nature of a
prelude, and opens with a long solilo
quoy by Faust, an agend German stu
dent who has just passed a night in
his study. He has become weary of
'fruitless inquiry into the mysteries of
Nature. As the morning breaks, he
salutes it as his last on earth and is
about to pledge it with a cup of poi
son when he is twice interrupted;
first, with the music by a maiden's
chorus whose theme is the joy of life,
and second, by the chanting of reap
ers in which there is gratitude to God
expressed.
Faust is maddened and summons the
evil spirit, Mehistopheles, to whom
he contracts to give his soul in ex
change for a restoration of his youth.
Mephistopheles affects the transforma
tion, and then reveals to him a vision
of Marguerite, a beautiful village
maiden at her spinning wheel, the
whirr of which is described by violins
accompanied by harps. The second
act opens on a tavern called the
"Kermesse," in which the chorus of
students, old men and girls, is con
trasted in and given characteristic
color. At this place, Faust encounters
Marguerite who has been left in the
care of Martha, by the brother, Valen
tin. Valentin sings a tender song to a
medallion of his sister which.he wears
as a charm. This is followed by a
weird drinking song by Mephisto
pheles, who, at its finish, proposes the
health of Marguerite. Valentin springs
forward to resent the insult, only to
have his sword broken in his hands.
The students and soldiers, recogniz
ing the stranger as the devil, over
come him by forming a cross with
their swords, the scene being accom
panied by one of the most effective
choruses in the whole opera. The
devil gone, the scene resumes its form
er gayety and the act closes with a
delightful waltz.
The third act opens on a beautiful
garden before Marguerite's dwelling.
As Mephistopheles and Faust approach
the house, Faust sings a passionate

aria to Marguerite.
Marguerite enters, and seating her
self at her spinning wheel, sings the
spinning wheel song. Seeing the
casket of jewels which Faust has
left for her, she thrusts aside the
simple nosegay given her by her pea
sant lover, Siebel, and siugs with
childish glee, the jewel song. Faust
succeeds in engaging the young girl's
affections, and the scene closes with
a duet which is filled with passion
and tenderness.
In the fourth act, Marguerite, who
has been taunted by the other girls,
laments her fate. Faust and Mephisto
pheles appear before her dwelling, the
latter singing a grotesque serenade. A
lively trio follows, when a quarrel
ensues with the appearance of Valen
tin, who has just returned from the
wars. Valentin challenges Faust and
in the encouter, is slain by Mephisto
plieles. The act ends in a church in
which there is a wonderful combination
of Marguerite's appeals for mercy,
Satan's tauntings, and the solemn
strains of the organ.
Act five opens on a hall of pagan
enchantment in the Hartz Mountains,
to which Faust and the devil have
proceeded. A long melancholy pre
lude is heard in the orchestra as the
scene changes to the prison in which
Marguerite is confined for having
murdered her child in a temporary fit
of insanity. Faust urges her to fly
with him, but she refuses, placing her
reliance for salvation in earnest pray
er. The scene is led with constantly
increasing power to an energetic cli
max, the music dying as Marguerite
expires. As the devil revels over the
catastrophe which he has wrought,
angels appear amid celestial music and
conduct Marguerite to Heaven. Faust
prostrates himself in prayer, while
Mephistopheles trembles t under the
avenging sword of the angel just as
the play closes.
Incidental dances in connection with
the opera will be given by Natale Ca
rossio's corps de ballet of fifty.
"Carmen" will be given in the Sta
dium tomorrow night, with Ina Bour
skaja, Giovanni Martinelli, Vicente
Ballester, Bianca Saroya, and Leon
Rothier in the principal roles. There
will also be a large chorus of peasants,
soldiers, cigarette girls, toreadors,
and smugglers, and two feature ballet
numbers.
