# "ADAM AND EVA " OFFERS OPPORTUNITY FOR PARADE OF ALL LATEST FASHIONS
## 
### 
"The best dressed show in years"—
that is how Coach Gordon Davis has
characterized "Adam and Eva," to bo
presented in the Assembly Hall, June
14. In their wild rampage of spending
Father King's hard-earned money, all
the relatives, near and far, deck them
selves in the latest of Paris dictates.
The cast will have free choices at a
San Francisco clothing store and the
Senior Farce promises to be a veri
table fashion parade.

Bill Shiels has dropped the Irish
brogue which won the hearts of the
Ram's Head chorus beauties, for the
English cockney. In "Adam and Eva"
he will appear as the titled Britisher
who has come across to unite, finance
with his title but who ends by taking
up quarters in a livery stable.

Hyper-acidity—have you ever heard
of it? That is what Hollis Chalmers
as the uncle thinks is the matter with
him, until he learns that the King
fortune has disappeared and the jewels
have been Htolen. Then he goes to
work as a real estate agent and in his

enthusiasm forgets his complaint.

The campus appreciates its regular
Thespians and likes to compare each
new performance with the past—but
it also welcomes and enjoys new tal
ent. In "Adam and Eva" there will
be both. Neither of the leads have
been seen by the present college gene
ration on the stage here. Dan Evans
has not faced the footlight since the
war and Wanda Leach is making her
debut at Stanford. Evans plays tlio
able young man who takes it upon
himself to reform an extravagant
family. This task requires that sus
picion be thrown upon his motives, but
Eva is constant, and when the truth
is finally learned, she is in a position
to say to the suspicious one, "I told
you so."

Training of the farce cast will end
Saturday and the final rehearsal will
be held then, in order that those in
the play may be free for examination
week. Sets, costumes, lines —every-
thing will be in readiness several days
in advance.
