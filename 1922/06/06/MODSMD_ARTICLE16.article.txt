# NEW THOMAS ENGINE GIVEN TO UNIVERSITY BY UNNAMED DONOR
## 
### 
A Thomas Combination Chemical
and Hose Engine, slightly used, has
been given to the University by a
close friend to Fire Marshall Ed Lamb.
Marshall Lamb refuses to announce
the name of the donor of the ninety
horse-power, % four cylinder motor
pump, only saying that the man is in
terested in the Stanford Fire Depart
ment.
Eight thousand dollars is approxi
mately the value of the unit when it
was new. The frame and engine are
in excellent condition, Marshall Lamb
says, and he expects to be able to
equip the machine up to metropolitan
standard with about. $500.
Two thirty-five gallon chemical tanks
and a hose reel, dismantled from a dis
carded horse-cart of the Hanford. Gal.,
Fire Department, will arrive soon for
the new acquisition of Marshall Lamb.
Besides this, there is place on the en
gine for 1000 feet of hose and a power
ful pump. These will be added later.
The heavy steel body which now
adds weight to the chassis, is to be
removed, and a hard-wood frame sub
stituted. The mechanical plant will
be entirely overhauled and inspected
and the red and gold paint will be
applied lavishly to all the visible
parts.
Fire Marshall Lamb estimates that
this work will take at least two
months. All the labor will be done
in the University shops.
