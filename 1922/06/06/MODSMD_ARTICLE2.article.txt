# NEW BUYING PLANS TO BE WORKED OUT FOR CAMPUS GROUPS
## 
### 
Purchasing plans for the Associated
Stanford Buyers in preparation for the
fall quarter will be worked our during
the summer, according to E. H. Moel
ler, '24, president of the association.
New bids for supplying foodstuffs will
be invited by the executive committee.
It is hoped that a satisfactory ar
rangement can be made in regard to
buying coal through the University.
In the opinion of Moeller, the best
method for the association to use is
to giye much of the business as pos
sible tQ pile large firm. In pursuing
this policy plans will be discussed with
several hig companies in San Fran
cisco. The combined business which
the association will have to offer next
year will be in the neighborhood of
$25,000 per month, due to the addition
of Sequoia Hall to the association. The
latter attlon was taken by E. D. Lan
dels, 'manager of Sequoia. An ef
fort will he made to include Roble
and Madrono halls in the organiza
tion. ( , 1
The associated Stanford Buyers or

of the Interfraternity Conference. The
association began operations at the
first of this term and now includes
twenty-two fraternities, ten sororities,
six eating clubs and the Bachelors'
Mess.
