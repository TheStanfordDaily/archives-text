# JUST A REMINDER FOR EXAMINATIONS
## 
### 
With the close of the term and the approach of
examinations a word about conduct in classrooms is
not out of the way. Since the establishment of the
honor system as an institution in the University
there has been a steady decrease in the number of
cases of violations of the system at each examina
tion time. We like to think that this means that
there are less infractions of the honor rules. This
ought to be the case.
There is no reason, however, why this examina
tion period should not he passed without any viola
tions and for the good reason that there should not
by now be any to report. We ought, after two
.years under the self-government system, be able to
conduct ourselves in classrooms so that no possible
censure can fall upon us.
Last quarter in many courses the use of type
writers was permitted. This meant that the ex
aminations could be written in rooms far away from
any interference by instructor, and without any
connection with the class. This is going the limit as
far as the institution of purely personal honor goes,
as there is not even the slightest control by one's
neighbors.
If this system is extended this time, and there is
likelihood that it will be, it means that we are prac
tically being allowed to take our exes any way that
is the most convenient to us. This is the height of
co-operation by the faculty. Our part is to go as
far as we can to show them that we are trying to do
our best to broaden and perpetuate this system by
not allowing any infractions to show up in the using
of the honor code.
