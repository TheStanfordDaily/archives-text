						LOAN WHERE NEEDED
## 
### 
' The appointment office is trying to organize a
I>ook loan exchange for the benefit of students who
.are in need of books for a quarter and are financially
handicapped so that they can't buy them.
To do this Mrs. Snell has arranged to have shelves
put in the appointment office, where the books may
be kept on file to be borrowed for the quarter or
time of instruction by the student. A loan system
will be used so that the book will not be permanently
out of the collection, and it will act as a text for
several years. This will make possible a material
cut in the expenses of many students if everyone
who has books will get behind the movement and
turn in his surplus instead of leaving old texts
lying around his room or home.
The committee in charge of the student end of
the book-gathering campaign will help to gather the
books up the last of the week. To make this a suc
cess every one must get in and see that any of his
extra books are in a place that they can be easily
reachcd.
This system is one that has found favor in most
of the larger universities of the country and should
be of great service here. Just remember that in
bringing out your old books, so that some man or
woman can use them, instead of having them go
into the basement or the fire, may mean a big help
to someone that is very needy of any help that he or
she can get in a financial way while in college.
