### 
Very few students in the University who have
not had active contact with the appointment office
know of the service that the office offers to those

who are in need of positions of every kind. Not
only is such a placement bureau a part of the work
of the office, but, in addition, there is information
there on all kinds of vocational statistics, wage
charts in different occupations, and people thor
oughly acquainted with employment and placement
work are in charge to give service at all times to
anyone desiring it.
Mrs. Elizabeth Snell, who is the appointment
secretary, urges that all men and women graduating
this year come and make themselves acquainted with
the office and register there, so that they may'keep
in touch with the office after graduation. In this
way accurate data may be had on all the graduates
of the University and information may be had by
any as to the work that the others are doing. The
close touch that the appointment keeps with the out
side business world gives it a number of positions to
offer all of the time, and these may be had by grad
uates who are on the lookout for such jobs.
The index that is kept in the appointment office
consists of statistics as to what the student does,
and not only his scholarship, but all activities partici
pated in, leaderships shown, and other qualifications
are entered on this record, and this can be gotten
as references for prospective employers. A visit to
the appointment office and a talk with Mrs. Snell
will help out her records and will give you an in
sight into the workings of the service which is doing
so much today for Stanford and its graduates.
