Now Sally was a lovely miss,
And withal very pretty;
Which all comes in quite handy as
The subject of a ditty.
Now Sally's folks were very rich;
You might e'en call them wealthy.
And while they were not millionaires
Their bank account was healthy.

And seldom went out riding.

Biggest reasons was that
Sally was only
Two years old.
