7 his is the idea some engineer may
have as to the geologic attitude. It does
not reflect the average of the viewpoints,
hou'ever, according to our belief. The
campus is just about as good as always,
and in no very likely way of "going to
the dogs." Only this morning zee stood
on the crossing at the railroad and saiv
twenty-five men get lifts to the campus in
six or seven machines.â€”The Editor.
Editor, Daily Palo Alto
it was a good custom while it lived, that
habit of saying "Hello" to another Stan
ford man while walking along the Quad
or to the P. O. It brought the fellows a
little closer, and made a man feel a little
better after he had gotten a 2 or a 3 in
a ten-minute ex. Of course, it was some
what of a bother to treat the other men
on the campus as equals and friends, but
it was worth it, in the opinions of the
Stanford men of past generations, and
still is, in the opinions of the few yet
remaining.
To quote Chappie : "Now that this insti
tution is becoming a Graduate School,
and one can walk all the way to Paly in
the dust of uncountable Mercers and
Cads, and Frosh use their Dinks merely
as openwork frames for their Staycomb
'Works of Art,' and Golf Stockings, and
everything, changes are bound to occur,
and the present state of the 'Hello' cus
tom is one of them."
Although the Geologists may take ex
ception to this statement, I have noticed
that the temperature invariably drops
about 15 degrees when Engineering Cor
ner is reached, on the way from the Hall
to the P. O. As I said before, it IS
sometimes bothersome to recognize
everyone in such an Institution as worthy
of a "Hello," even a brother upperclass
man. Plumb Digusted Engineer.
