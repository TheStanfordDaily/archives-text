# DUTCH GEOLOGIST TO TALK ON EAST INDIES TOMORROW
## 
### 
"Nature and People in the East In
dies," will be the subject of a lecture by
Doctor H. A. Brouwer, professor of
Geology in the Technical College of
Delft, Holland, tomorrow evening at 7 :30
in the Little Theater.
Dr. Brouwer has spent many years in
the East Indies and is widely known in
Europe and the United States as an au
thority on the peculiar geological prob
lems of these islands. His interests have
not been confined to geology but have
extended to the people and their cus
toms.
According to Professor Bailey Willis,
the lecture will be of special interest to
those who are familiar with the Coast
Ranges of California, because the East
Indies, like the Coast Ranges, are grow
ing mountains and are subject to fre
quent earthquake shocks. There is no
region in the world which has more
striking mountain forms than these south
Pacific islands. They are also a region
of great volcanic activity.
The lecture will be illustrated with
lantern views showing the scenery of the
islands.
Dr. Brouwer will give a technical lec
ture on "Growths of Mountain Arcs in
the East Indies," Thursday morning at
11 o'clock in Room 320 of the Geology
Building. All interested are invited to
attend.
