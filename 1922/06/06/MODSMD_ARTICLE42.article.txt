# WORK STARTED ON TRACKBED OF NEW OVAL IN STADIUM
## 
### 
Work was begun yesterday on the first
part of a five-layer trackbed which will
be constructed for the new stadium.
Three inches of redwood shavings are
being laid on the foundation of crushed
rock which has been completed. From
the start of the 220-yard straightaway
about 75 yards of the shavings have been
put down.
On top of the redwood shavings will
he placed two inches of crushcl rock
and cinders. Next will.come an inch of
clay, and following this will be a two
inch mixed layer of two-thirds clay and
one-third cinders. The final layer will
be composed of equal portions of clay
and cinders. So far "Dad" Moulton has
not been satisfied with the samples of
hard-coal cinders which he has received
from various parts of the United States,
and no shipments of cinders have yet
been ordered. At present it is hoped
that the right kind of track material may
be obtained from Vancouver, Canada.
"Reggie" Woodward, who has served
many times as the referee for the rugby
contests between Stanford and Califor
ilia, and who is probably the best known
sportsman in Canada, has promised his
aid in procuring the elusive grade of cin
ders.
The curbing which is being constructed
around the track is almost completed on
the straightaway, while the work on
about half of the rest of the oval is fin
ished. The contractors intend to have
the entire track oval completed by the
time*of the Big Game next fall.
