## San Francisco Fireman's Band Will Contribute Services to Children's Gala Circus 
### 
Never in its palmiest days did the
stage coach of the late Senator Stanford
have the honor of figuring with the
splendor that will surround it next Sat
urday afternoon, when Miss Louise
Halm, the queen of the benefit Circus in
Menlo Park, will make her grand en
trance in this historic coach. The queen
will have in her entourage, heralds and
outriders and seventy mounted attend

The four special attendants of the
Polly of the Circus will be Evelyn Tay
lor, Marjory Morrison, Sybil Coryell and
Hope Austin. Nancy Merrill and Kath
erine Trent will be the heralds. The
riders will follow the white coach-and
fuur of the, queen, the smallest riders
first, and so on, until all enter the arena
four abreast. Boys and girls will be
cbstumed in the red and white of an
English fox hunt.
Every feature of a real equestrian cir
cus will be duplicated by the scores of
children taking part in the program.
Races, bareback riding, ring performers,
and special stunts by trained horses and
dogs will be features of the children's
Circus. Clarence Walters, who man
aged last year's circus, will again be ring

with the idea of helping in this charity
that they promptly agreed to come down
free of all expenses.
Now the Peninsula Rapid Transit
Company has removed the single item of

company, notifying him that Mayor W.
H. Pearson, of Burlingame, who is presi
dent of the company, has givbn instruc
tions that the bus be placed at the dis

have the honor of figuring with the
splendor that will surround it next Sat
urday afternoon, when Miss Louise
Halm, the queen of the benefit Circus in
Menlo Park, will make her grand en
trance in this historic coach. The queen
will have in her entourage, heralds and
outriders and seventy mounted attend
ants, all in gala costume.
The four special attendants of the
Polly of the Circus will be Evelyn Tay
lor, Marjory Morrison, Sybil Coryell and
Hope Austin. Nancy Merrill and Kath
erine Trent will be the heralds. The
riders will follow the white coach-and
fuur of the, queen, the smallest riders
first, and so on, until all enter the arena
four abreast. Boys and girls will be
cbstumed in the red and white of an
English fox hunt.
Every feature of a real equestrian cir
cus will be duplicated by the scores of
children taking part in the program.
Races, bareback riding, ring performers,
and special stunts by trained horses and
dogs will be features of the children's
Circus. Clarence Walters, who man
aged last year's circus, will again be ring
master.
The San Francisco Firemen's Band
will play for the Circus; the members
have donated their services.
When Fire Marshal Edward Lamb of
the Stanford fire department presented
the matter to them they were so taken
with the idea of helping in this charity
that they promptly agreed to come down
free of all expenses.
Now the Peninsula Rapid Transit
Company has removed the single item of
eost that remained in this connection by
donating the service of a bus and opera
tor from San Francisco to Hahn Field
and back again, to transport the band
and its instruments.
Lamb has just received a letter from
H. W. Reagan, vice-president of the
company, notifying him that Mayor W.
H. Pearson, of Burlingame, who is presi
dent of the company, has givbn instruc
tions that the bus be placed at the dis
posal of the band for this occasion. Rea
gan also expresses his own and Mayor
Pearson's hearty good wishes for the
success of the Children's Circus and con
gratulations at the prospect of the day's
providing a large sum for the mainte
nance of the Convalescent Home.
There are several thousand dollars al
ready in the fund for the Convalescent
Home and tickets are selling most satis
factorily.
