# FAMOUS "CARMEN" OPERA IS STADIUM OFFERING TONIGHT
## Ina Bourskaja as Carmen and Giovanni Martinelli as Don Jose Will Have Main Roles 
### 
George Bizet's "Carmen," a grand
opera in four acts, will be the Stadium
production tonight at 8:15. Carmen, a
Spanish gypsy, will be played by Ina
Bourskaja, Russian actress, who has
been engaged for next season by the
Metropolitan Grand Opera Company.
The role of Don Jose, a brigadier in the
Spanish army, often interpreted by En
rico Caruso, will be taken by Giovanni
Martinelli.
Vicente Ballester. baritone of the Chi
cago Opera Association, will play the
part of Escamillo, a Toreador and an
other suitor of Carmen's. The role of
Don Jose's bride, Michaela, will be sung
by Bianca Saroya, beautiful soprano who
was with the Boston Opera Company
and who has recently returned from
successes in European capitals.
"Carmen" is considered by critics to
be one of the best in the modern French
repertoire. The opera is essentially
Spanish in tone and spirit throughout.
The music is of a Southern character
and is passionate and original. The
dance tempo is frequently used, and, ex
cept in the third act, the orchestral work
is considered better than that of the
vocal parts.
The iirst act opens on a public square
which is tilled with soldiers under the
command of Don Jose, and loungers
who are waiting the approach of the
pretty girls working in a nearby cigar
factory. Prettiest and most heartless of
them all is Carmen, who is betrothed to
Don Jose. Before the workers appear,
Michaela, a village girl, enters the
square bearing a message to Don Jose
from his mother, but not finding him
there, departs. The cigar girls enter,
followed by Carmen, who is singing her
Habanera, a Spanish song. Observing
Don Jose, she throws him a rose, and
as she runs away, the orchestra bursts
forth with an explosion of passion.
Michaela, returning, gives Don Jose
his mother's message, and a serious duet
follows. Reminiscent thoughts of home
