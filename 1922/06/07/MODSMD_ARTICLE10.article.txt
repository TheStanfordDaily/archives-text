# FAMOUS "CARMEN" OPERA IS STADIUM OFFERING TONIGHT
## Ina Bourskaja as Carmen and Giovanni Martinelli as Don Jose Will Have Main Roles 
### 
George Bizet's "Carmen," a grand
opera in four acts, will be the Stadium
production tonight at 8:15. Carmen, a
Spanish gypsy, will be played by Ina
Bourskaja, Russian actress, who has
been engaged for next season by the
Metropolitan Grand Opera Company.
The role of Don Jose, a brigadier in the
Spanish army, often interpreted by En
rico Caruso, will be taken by Giovanni
Martinelli.
Vicente Ballester. baritone of the Chi
cago Opera Association, will play the
part of Escamillo, a Toreador and an
other suitor of Carmen's. The role of
Don Jose's bride, Michaela, will be sung
by Bianca Saroya, beautiful soprano who
was with the Boston Opera Company
and who has recently returned from
successes in European capitals.
"Carmen" is considered by critics to
be one of the best in the modern French
repertoire. The opera is essentially
Spanish in tone and spirit throughout.
The music is of a Southern character
and is passionate and original. The
dance tempo is frequently used, and, ex
cept in the third act, the orchestral work
is considered better than that of the
vocal parts.
The iirst act opens on a public square
which is tilled with soldiers under the
command of Don Jose, and loungers
who are waiting the approach of the
pretty girls working in a nearby cigar
factory. Prettiest and most heartless of
them all is Carmen, who is betrothed to
Don Jose. Before the workers appear,
Michaela, a village girl, enters the
square bearing a message to Don Jose
from his mother, but not finding him
there, departs. The cigar girls enter,
followed by Carmen, who is singing her
Habanera, a Spanish song. Observing
Don Jose, she throws him a rose, and
as she runs away, the orchestra bursts
forth with an explosion of passion.
Michaela, returning, gives Don Jose
his mother's message, and a serious duet
follows. Reminiscent thoughts of home
temporarily dispel Don Jose's growing
passion for Carmen. He is about to
throw away her rose, when a sudden
disturbance is heard in the nearby fac
tory. It is found that Carmen has quar
reled with one of the girls and has
wounded her. Carmen is arrested and
to prevent further mischief, her hands
are tied, as she sings mockingly. Don
Jose is bewitched by her, and the or
chestra with a harsh accompaniment
culminates in a loud crash of triumph.
After Carmen has sung a dance tempo,
Don Jose arranges for her escape as
she is being led away by the soldiers to
prison, and as this is effected the Hab
anera is heard again.
Carmen returns to her wandering
gypsy life, and in the second act she is
singing and dancing in a cabaret with
her companions. Among the new ar
rivals is Escamillo, a victorious bull
lighter with whom Carmen is at once in
fatuated. Escamillo sings the famous
Toreador song, in which he describes
the bull-light.
When the inn is closed, the guests
depart, but Carmen and the gypsy smug
glers wait for the arrival of Don Jose,
who is induced by Carmen to join their
band. She prevails upon him to remain
in spite of the trumpet call which
summons him to duty. An officer ap
pears and orders Don Jose out, who
refuses to go. Carmen summons the
smugglers, who overpower the officer
while Don Jose escapes into the moun
tains.
The third act opens in the haunt of

the smugglers in the mountains, and a
dramatic terzetto by the smugglers is
heard. Escamillo, who has been follow
ing Carmen, appears, and as Don Jose
rushes at him and is about to kill him,
Carmen intervenes. Escamillo departs
after having invited them to the ap
proaching bull-light at Seville.
Michaela enters in quest of Don Jose,
singing what is considered the most ef
fective and beautiful number in the
whole work. Don Jose leaves with her
when he is told that his mother is dying.
The last act is at the bull-fight. Fol
lowing a Fandango to the accompani
ment of castanets and tambourines, Fs
camillo enters singing a Toreador march,
with Carmen on his arm. He goes into
the arena and Carmen is about to fol

low, when Don Jose appears and stops
her, and appeals once more for her love.
Carmen refuses, and in the stormy duet
hurls the ring Don Jose had given her
:it his feet. Shouts from the people in
the arena announce another victory for
Eseamillo. Carmen shows great joy and
Don Jose, springing at her, stabs her
just as Eseamillo emerges from his con
test.
Miss C. La Main and the corps de
ballet of fifty will give two feature
dances during the evening—one during
the second act and the other during the
fourth.
"Carmen" will be repeated on Friday
evening, June 16. "Faust," in five acts,
will be presented in the Stadium Sat
urday night, June 10.

passion for Carmen. He is about to
throw away her rose, when a sudden
disturbance is heard in the nearby fac
tory. It is found that Carmen has quar
reled with one of the girls and has
wounded her. Carmen is arrested and
to prevent further mischief, her hands
are tied, as she sings mockingly. Don
Jose is bewitched by her, and the or
chestra with a harsh accompaniment
culminates in a loud crash of triumph.
After Carmen has sung a dance tempo,
Don Jose arranges for her escape as
she is being led away by the soldiers to
prison, and as this is effected the Hab
anera is heard again.
Carmen returns to her wandering
gypsy life, and in the second act she is
singing and dancing in a cabaret with
her companions. Among the new ar
rivals is Escamillo, a victorious bull
lighter with whom Carmen is at once in
fatuated. Escamillo sings the famous
Toreador song, in which he describes
the bull-light.
When the inn is closed, the guests
depart, but Carmen and the gypsy smug
glers wait for the arrival of Don Jose,
who is induced by Carmen to join their
band. She prevails upon him to remain
in spite of the trumpet call which
summons him to duty. An officer ap
pears and orders Don Jose out, who
refuses to go. Carmen summons the
smugglers, who overpower the officer
while Don Jose escapes into the moun
tains.
The third act opens in the haunt of

the smugglers in the mountains, and a
dramatic terzetto by the smugglers is
heard. Escamillo, who has been follow
ing Carmen, appears, and as Don Jose
rushes at him and is about to kill him,
Carmen intervenes. Escamillo departs
after having invited them to the ap
proaching bull-light at Seville.
Michaela enters in quest of Don Jose,
singing what is considered the most ef
fective and beautiful number in the
whole work. Don Jose leaves with her
when he is told that his mother is dying.
The last act is at the bull-fight. Fol
lowing a Fandango to the accompani
ment of castanets and tambourines, Fs
camillo enters singing a Toreador march,
with Carmen on his arm. He goes into
the arena and Carmen is about to fol

low, when Don Jose appears and stops
her, and appeals once more for her love.
Carmen refuses, and in the stormy duet
hurls the ring Don Jose had given her
:it his feet. Shouts from the people in
the arena announce another victory for
Eseamillo. Carmen shows great joy and
Don Jose, springing at her, stabs her
just as Eseamillo emerges from his con
test.
Miss C. La Main and the corps de
ballet of fifty will give two feature
dances during the evening—one during
the second act and the other during the
fourth.
"Carmen" will be repeated on Friday
evening, June 16. "Faust," in five acts,
will be presented in the Stadium Sat
urday night, June 10.
George Bizet's "Carmen," a grand
opera in four acts, will be the Stadium
production tonight at 8:15. Carmen, a
Spanish gypsy, will be played by Ina
Bourskaja, Russian actress, who has
been engaged for next season by the
Metropolitan Grand Opera Company.
The role of Don Jose, a brigadier in the
Spanish army, often interpreted by En
rico Caruso, will be taken by Giovanni
Martinelli.
Vicente Ballester. baritone of the Chi
cago Opera Association, will play the
part of Escamillo, a Toreador and an
other suitor of Carmen's. The role of
Don Jose's bride, Michaela, will be sung
by Bianca Saroya, beautiful soprano who
was with the Boston Opera Company
and who has recently returned from
successes in European capitals.
"Carmen" is considered by critics to
be one of the best in the modern French
repertoire. The opera is essentially
Spanish in tone and spirit throughout.
The music is of a Southern character
and is passionate and original. The
dance tempo is frequently used, and, ex
cept in the third act, the orchestral work
is considered better than that of the
vocal parts.
The iirst act opens on a public square
which is tilled with soldiers under the
command of Don Jose, and loungers
who are waiting the approach of the
pretty girls working in a nearby cigar
factory. Prettiest and most heartless of
them all is Carmen, who is betrothed to
Don Jose. Before the workers appear,
Michaela, a village girl, enters the
square bearing a message to Don Jose
from his mother, but not finding him
there, departs. The cigar girls enter,
followed by Carmen, who is singing her
Habanera, a Spanish song. Observing
Don Jose, she throws him a rose, and
as she runs away, the orchestra bursts
forth with an explosion of passion.
Michaela, returning, gives Don Jose
his mother's message, and a serious duet
follows. Reminiscent thoughts of home

Don Jose's bride, Michaela, will be sung
by Bianca Saroya, beautiful soprano who
was with the Boston Opera Company
and who has recently returned from
successes in European capitals.
"Carmen" is considered by critics to
be one of the best in the modern French
repertoire. The opera is essentially
Spanish in tone and spirit throughout.
The music is of a Southern character
and is passionate and original. The
dance tempo is frequently used, and, ex
cept in the third act, the orchestral work
is considered better than that of the
vocal parts.
The iirst act opens on a public square
which is tilled with soldiers under the
command of Don Jose, and loungers
who are waiting the approach of the
pretty girls working in a nearby cigar
factory. Prettiest and most heartless of
them all is Carmen, who is betrothed to
Don Jose. Before the workers appear,
Michaela, a village girl, enters the
square bearing a message to Don Jose
from his mother, but not finding him
there, departs. The cigar girls enter,
followed by Carmen, who is singing her
Habanera, a Spanish song. Observing
Don Jose, she throws him a rose, and
as she runs away, the orchestra bursts
forth with an explosion of passion.
Michaela, returning, gives Don Jose
his mother's message, and a serious duet
follows. Reminiscent thoughts of home
temporarily dispel Don Jose's growing
passion for Carmen. He is about to
throw away her rose, when a sudden
disturbance is heard in the nearby fac
tory. It is found that Carmen has quar
reled with one of the girls and has
wounded her. Carmen is arrested and
to prevent further mischief, her hands
are tied, as she sings mockingly. Don
Jose is bewitched by her, and the or
chestra with a harsh accompaniment
culminates in a loud crash of triumph.
After Carmen has sung a dance tempo,
Don Jose arranges for her escape as
she is being led away by the soldiers to
prison, and as this is effected the Hab
anera is heard again.
Carmen returns to her wandering
gypsy life, and in the second act she is
singing and dancing in a cabaret with
her companions. Among the new ar
rivals is Escamillo, a victorious bull
lighter with whom Carmen is at once in
fatuated. Escamillo sings the famous
Toreador song, in which he describes
the bull-light.
When the inn is closed, the guests
depart, but Carmen and the gypsy smug
glers wait for the arrival of Don Jose,
who is induced by Carmen to join their
band. She prevails upon him to remain
in spite of the trumpet call which
summons him to duty. An officer ap
pears and orders Don Jose out, who
refuses to go. Carmen summons the
smugglers, who overpower the officer
while Don Jose escapes into the moun
tains.
The third act opens in the haunt of

the smugglers in the mountains, and a
dramatic terzetto by the smugglers is
heard. Escamillo, who has been follow
ing Carmen, appears, and as Don Jose
rushes at him and is about to kill him,
Carmen intervenes. Escamillo departs
after having invited them to the ap
proaching bull-light at Seville.
Michaela enters in quest of Don Jose,
singing what is considered the most ef
fective and beautiful number in the
whole work. Don Jose leaves with her
when he is told that his mother is dying.
The last act is at the bull-fight. Fol
lowing a Fandango to the accompani
ment of castanets and tambourines, Fs
camillo enters singing a Toreador march,
with Carmen on his arm. He goes into
