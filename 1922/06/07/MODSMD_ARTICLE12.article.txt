# PROFESSOR BLACK ROUTS IDEA OF AMERICAN TYPE
## 
### 
"You can't sum up America in a
sentence." This was the assertion
made by Professor High Black of the
Union Theological Seminary of New
York, in his address last evening in
the Little Theater, when he spoke on
the subject, "America Through Scot
tish Spectacles."
. "The average tourist," the speaker
continued, "makes too hasty generali
zations. There is no such creature as
the 'typical American* of stage ft>me,
and we must not base our judgments
of the American people upon this cari
cature of their national type.
"To look at America through Scot
tish spectacles is to study her through
a sympathetic medium, because in
numerous respects these two peoples
arc closely akin.
"There are three divisions into
which I would organize my impres
sions of America," Dr. Black continued,

"and those three are,, Language, Poli
tics, and Temperament. 1 have ob
served that the American is more pure
ly English than the Englishman him
self. In this country you have re
tained many old English words that
have long since been lost in the
mother land; the literary men of Amer
ica are more careful of their use of
the language than is true of English
writers; and lastly, the English tongue
is spoken in this country with more
uniformity than in any other country
in the world. America has developed
a great power of absorption in regard
to her immigrants, and by it she has
been successful in forcing them to
adopt her language rather than per
mitting them to retain their own. I
do not feel that as long as this custom
continues America has anything to
fear from the problem of unrestricted
immigration."
