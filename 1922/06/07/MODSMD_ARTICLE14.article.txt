# BETA THETA PI TOPS INTRAMURAL FINALS
## 
### W.L. Wright, '25 
Top and collar positions remain un
changed after yesterday's intramural
baseball program, when Beta Theta Pi
nosed out Phi Delta Theta by a 11 to
10' score, and Sigma Chi dropped an
other game to Kappa Sigma, 4 to 3. The
standing of the five finalists at present
is as follows:
Won Lost Pet.
Beta Theta Pi 2 0 1.000
Kappa Sigma 2 1 .666
Alpha Delta Phi 1 1 .500
Phi Delta Theta 1 2 .333
Sigma Chi 0 1 .000
As the final games are yet to be played
after the Daily suspends publication for
the year, it will be impossible to an
nounce the results. So far as is safe to
predict anything, Beta Theta Pi looms
as a probable winner, as Sigma Chi's
record seems to indicate an easy victory
for Beta Theta Pi. This will leave
Alpha Delta Phi as the only bar to the
championship, and it must be admitted
a formidable bar. Kappa Sigma's only
remaining game is also with Alpha Delta
Phi. 1o the result of the series hangs
upoi. Sigma Chi. If Beta Theta Pi de
feats them, the series will go to Beta
Theta Pi, or result in a tie, but if Sigma
Chi is victorious Kappa Sigma still has
a chance to come out on top.
The Beta Theta Pi-Phi Delta Theta
contest yesterday was an old-fashioned
slugging match, with the pitchers serv
ing the ball and the out-fielders bringing
it back. Honors go to Mike Reed, the
Beta Theta Pi twirler, who won his own
game with a home run, scoring two men
before him, in the first inning, and later
contributed another single. Langford
got three blows in four times at bat.
Beta Theta Pi used twelve hits in gath
