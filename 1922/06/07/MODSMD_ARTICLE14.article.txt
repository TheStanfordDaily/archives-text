# BETA THETA PI TOPS INTRAMURAL FINALS
## 
### W.L. Wright, '25 
Top and collar positions remain un
changed after yesterday's intramural
baseball program, when Beta Theta Pi
nosed out Phi Delta Theta by a 11 to
10' score, and Sigma Chi dropped an
other game to Kappa Sigma, 4 to 3. The
standing of the five finalists at present
is as follows:
Won Lost Pet.
Beta Theta Pi 2 0 1.000
Kappa Sigma 2 1 .666
Alpha Delta Phi 1 1 .500
Phi Delta Theta 1 2 .333
Sigma Chi 0 1 .000
As the final games are yet to be played
after the Daily suspends publication for
the year, it will be impossible to an
nounce the results. So far as is safe to
predict anything, Beta Theta Pi looms
as a probable winner, as Sigma Chi's
record seems to indicate an easy victory
for Beta Theta Pi. This will leave
Alpha Delta Phi as the only bar to the
championship, and it must be admitted
a formidable bar. Kappa Sigma's only
remaining game is also with Alpha Delta
Phi. 1o the result of the series hangs
upoi. Sigma Chi. If Beta Theta Pi de
feats them, the series will go to Beta
Theta Pi, or result in a tie, but if Sigma
Chi is victorious Kappa Sigma still has
a chance to come out on top.
The Beta Theta Pi-Phi Delta Theta
contest yesterday was an old-fashioned
slugging match, with the pitchers serv
ing the ball and the out-fielders bringing
it back. Honors go to Mike Reed, the
Beta Theta Pi twirler, who won his own
game with a home run, scoring two men
before him, in the first inning, and later
contributed another single. Langford
got three blows in four times at bat.
Beta Theta Pi used twelve hits in gath
ering their eleven runs, and Phi Delta
Theta made ten bingles count for as
many runs. Phi Delta Theta took the
lead in the first frame and held it until
the fifth, when four hits by Beta Theta
Pi, combined with errors and stolen
bases, sent four runs over the plate, and
won the game. Reed and Bruce were
the Beta Theta Pi battery, with Edwards
and Kraft working for Phi Delta Theta.
Loose pitching and tight fielding feat
ured Kappa Sigma's 4 to 3 victory over
Sigma Chf. Sixteen hits went to Kappa
Sigma batsmen for a total of four runs,
and Sigma Chi took fifteen safe blows
to send three men home. Sigma Chi
piled up a two-run lead in the first three
innings, but in the fifth, as usual, Kappa
Sigma went out and brought in just
enough tallies for a clean victory. A
triple by Rogers, scoring two men from
the bases, was of material assistance in
this rally. Powell and Spiers were at
the points for Kappa Sigma, with Mac
conel and Dallas on duty for Sigma Chi.

standing of the five finalists at present
is as follows:
Won Lost Pet.
Beta Theta Pi 2 0 1.000
Kappa Sigma 2 1 .666
Alpha Delta Phi 1 1 .500
Phi Delta Theta 1 2 .333
Sigma Chi 0 1 .000
As the final games are yet to be played
after the Daily suspends publication for
the year, it will be impossible to an
nounce the results. So far as is safe to
predict anything, Beta Theta Pi looms
as a probable winner, as Sigma Chi's
record seems to indicate an easy victory
for Beta Theta Pi. This will leave
Alpha Delta Phi as the only bar to the
championship, and it must be admitted
a formidable bar. Kappa Sigma's only
remaining game is also with Alpha Delta
Phi. 1o the result of the series hangs
upoi. Sigma Chi. If Beta Theta Pi de
feats them, the series will go to Beta
Theta Pi, or result in a tie, but if Sigma
Chi is victorious Kappa Sigma still has
a chance to come out on top.
The Beta Theta Pi-Phi Delta Theta
contest yesterday was an old-fashioned
slugging match, with the pitchers serv
ing the ball and the out-fielders bringing
it back. Honors go to Mike Reed, the
Beta Theta Pi twirler, who won his own
game with a home run, scoring two men
before him, in the first inning, and later
contributed another single. Langford
got three blows in four times at bat.
Beta Theta Pi used twelve hits in gath
ering their eleven runs, and Phi Delta
Theta made ten bingles count for as
many runs. Phi Delta Theta took the
lead in the first frame and held it until
the fifth, when four hits by Beta Theta
Pi, combined with errors and stolen
bases, sent four runs over the plate, and
won the game. Reed and Bruce were
the Beta Theta Pi battery, with Edwards
and Kraft working for Phi Delta Theta.
Loose pitching and tight fielding feat
ured Kappa Sigma's 4 to 3 victory over
Sigma Chf. Sixteen hits went to Kappa
Sigma batsmen for a total of four runs,
and Sigma Chi took fifteen safe blows
to send three men home. Sigma Chi
piled up a two-run lead in the first three
innings, but in the fifth, as usual, Kappa
Sigma went out and brought in just
enough tallies for a clean victory. A
triple by Rogers, scoring two men from
the bases, was of material assistance in
this rally. Powell and Spiers were at
the points for Kappa Sigma, with Mac
conel and Dallas on duty for Sigma Chi.
Top and collar positions remain un
changed after yesterday's intramural
baseball program, when Beta Theta Pi
nosed out Phi Delta Theta by a 11 to
10' score, and Sigma Chi dropped an
other game to Kappa Sigma, 4 to 3. The
standing of the five finalists at present
is as follows:
Won Lost Pet.
Beta Theta Pi 2 0 1.000
Kappa Sigma 2 1 .666
Alpha Delta Phi 1 1 .500
Phi Delta Theta 1 2 .333
