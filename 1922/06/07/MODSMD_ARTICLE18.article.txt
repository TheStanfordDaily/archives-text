# CARDINAL WILL HAVE PRIZE-WINNING POEMS AND OTHER FEATURES
## 
### 
The prize-winning poems in the Eng
lish Department's annual poetry contest
will be printed in the Cardinal for June,
which will be on sale on the Quad to
morrow. Katherine Beswick, '23, has
been awarded the first prize of fifty dol
lars, for a sonnet entitled, "The lncensc
Burner."
"The Maid of the Musachi," a story
of the Balkans, will be one of the pieces
of fiction offered to the campus public
in this month's edition of the Cardinal.
Margaret Boillot, the mother, served as
a Red Cross nurse in the Balkans during
the war and the material for the story
is drawn from her own observations and
experiences in this part of the globe.
An anonymous, semi-humorous satire,
"The Confession of a Moron at Stan
ford," and several other literary and
artistic productions complete the last
edition of the Cardinal for this year.
