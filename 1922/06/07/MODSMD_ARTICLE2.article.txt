# ALUMNI DAY REUNION SUMMARIZED IN NEXT ILLUSTRATED REVIEW
## 
### 
The "South Sea Island Follies," illus
trated, is one of the attractions of the
University Day number of the Illustrated
Review, coming out next Tuesday. A
great part of the number is devoted to
the alumni exercises on May 20, with
pictures, including a panorama of the
thirty classes.
"Don'ts" for next year's reunion chair
man are set forth by Charles K. Field,
'95, in an article which tells of the tribu
lations of the person in charge of the big
celebration. The entire day is summar
ized by Hazel Pedlar Faulkner. Dr. Har
ris J. Ryan, professor of electrical engi
neering, and one of the perpetrators of
the hilarious radio hoax, explains the
details and purpose of this deception for
the benefit of those lacking in a sense of
humor. Speeches made by Alonzo E.
Taylor on the food research work, and
by Professor Lewis Terman on his
"mental measurement" experiments, are
included.
Tom Klcckner, '19, has an interview
with President Wilbur on the Appoint
ment Office, which sets forth the advan
tages of the system and the progress
made by Mrs. Snell since the office was
established. W. F. Leiser, '21, gives a
review of the activities and accomplish
ments of the Board of Athletic Control
since last fall.
