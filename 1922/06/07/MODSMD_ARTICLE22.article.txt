# ACTIVITIES AS STUDIES
## 
### 
Jn a recent editorial in the Cardinal titled "Studies
vs. Activities" it was claimed that there were two
lines of interest in the University to be followed.
One was that of the "activitist" and the other that of
the student in a more or less confined sense of the
word.
Why is it that activities and study cannot go to
gether, and don't they to a great extent? Right on
the Daily there is one of the best examples of study
and activity going hand in hand. The Daily is a
student body activity and vet offers a practical course
in journalism to the man or woman who will really
work constructively while on the staff of the paper.
Activities in a college that make it something more
than an oral library are what draw the average stu
dent to the college. The entering students may not
be athletes and do not want to go into that kind of
activity, but they do not want to go to a dead college
and they will not come to a place that does not offer
activities as a diversion from the academic work.
If a man does his extra curricula!" part of his col
lege work well he is doing something for himself as
well as for his college. He is learning all the time.
Maybe it is not the stuff that is to be found in a law
or an economics book, but it is the science of play
that he is learning and this is one of the things that
learned well insures a long and happy life.
No, there is no reason why study and activity
cannot go hand in hand to a reasonable degree. Like
any other thing, if indulged in to excess there will
be harm done. This is not the idea. The thing to do
is to mix the two so that a healthful amount of one
will balance the other, and in the end the man and
woman who does tiiat will come out best although
from comparative points it may not seem so at the
time.
