# FROM CIRCULAR TO REAL BOOK
## 
### 
In the last year or sa Paul Clyde lias turned the
Illustrated Reviezv into a magazine that is of the very
highest interest for the reading matter that it con
tains. This interest is not only carried to the alumni
I>ody for whom the magazine is primarily published
l>nt to the undergraduate students and to the outside
public as well.
This has been accomplished by intelligent catering
to the wants of human readers. There is 110 differ
ence in a man because he is an alumnus of a uni
versity than if he were just an ordinary person. The
he has left his alma mater does not make
him any more susceptible to circularization than any
one else. Unless lie gets news of his old college in an
attractive form he will throw it into the waste basket
the same as any other ad.
The Illustrated now carries as live news as any of
the other Stanford publications and is appealing to
all types of readers. For the ones who desire to have
sport stories with the undergraduate viewpoint there
are the write-ups of the games and matches during
the year. Talks by the men who are managing the
University go out through the pages of this maga
zine.
The fact that the alumni appreciate the Illustrated
Review is shown by the increasing subscription list.
Credit for this latter goes in good measure to Jack
McDowell and his attractive array of advertising
reasons why no alumnus should be without his copy
of the Illustrated. The magazine is the one thing
which effectively carries the pulse of the under

graduate body to the alumni and knits more closelv
those bonds that tie the grad to the old "Farm."
