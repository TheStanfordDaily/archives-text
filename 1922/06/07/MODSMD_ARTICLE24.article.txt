THE BLUFFER'S OPERA
Scene 1. —Place: Outside classroom of a pipe gone
wrong. Time: five minutes before final. Characters:
Bad.
Enter Ruff, Stuff, and Guff. They sing bass, prov
ing them to be pretty low.
Gulf: —Here is the rub, boys,
The prof is just a dub;
He don't know his stuff, boys,
We have to bluff.
Ruff: —Take it from me, men,
Don't get into Math 10;
The instructor is a female
Her marks make us turn pale.
(Very deep)
She's terrible!
She's horrible!
Stuff: —Aw, Bull!
(Arrogant alto)
Guff: —I never study for exes,
It doesn't pay, I claim,
I gotta line that stretches
That's how to beat the game.
(Bass, very scornful)
Ruff: —Bunk!
That junk
Is punk
You flunk.
I know.
I throw.
It slow.
Stuff and Guff (loose harmony):—Now lissen here
To reason
if you want to smear,
This season,
Take our advice:
Tell the prof
He's brilliant, »
His lectures oft
Scintillant —
You'll win the dice.
(Orchestra leader presses button, and Last Bell rings)
Last Bell: —Bring-ing-ing!
Ing-ing!
Ing!
Ruff:—Hell!
Stuff:—The bell!
Guff: —Oh, well —
(They file raspingly into classroom, left)
Guff (offstage whispers) :— Don't shoot your cuff, Ruff,
Until the corrector goes;
Then we'll pull the rough stuff,
Under his nose.
