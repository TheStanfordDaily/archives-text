Today's issue is the last for this year. It also ends
the thirtieth year of the Daily Palo Alto as a Stan
ford publication. During that time the Daily has
come from a tiny four-column sheet to a real six
column standard paper. It compares favorably with
any of the other six-column papers of the colleges in
the country, and most of the great colleges still stick
to six columns instead of seven or eight as in city
journals.
The Daily in the last two or three years has been
getting away from political machinations and has
come to be a real student body activity with a staff
that is graded just the same as if it were 011 any
other organization representing the University.
The harmony which exists among the staff members
has been unbroken for the last year and everything
has gone smoothly as far as any dissension in the
staff is concerned. This has made the work of the
editor easier and easier at a time when he needed the
help of all the staff members.
The creation of an Editorial Board was looked
upon by many as a polite "shelf" for honorary mem
bers at the first of the present term. To the con
trary, the members of this board have been of the
greatest help. Bill Leiser has been a help in the mat
ter of editorial material whose loss would have
crippled the paper in the treatment of many subjects.
Harry Borba has spent practically as much time 011
the paper as he did when editor, and Mary Jane Clark
has stayed on to give her time to criticism work
where she was needed. All of these people have
given freely of their time and it has been appre
ciated.
As to the staff of the Daily, practically all the
members are men and women who have come on
since the beginning of the year. They have been
inexperienced in many cases and mistakes have re
sulted. The willingness to work has overcome this
in most cases. The women's end of the paper has
been especially well developed this year under the
guidance of Bertha Vaughan. She is one of the most
intelligent women journalists that the Daily has ever
had and is a good executive as well, and a pleasure
to work with.
This final editorial should have ended with a "lay
ing down of the editorial pen" and a few other
phrases from the hallowed past of journalism. To
day no one lays down any pens; probably he gets up
and leaves his typewriter without putting 011 the
cover. The stuff about "mingled feelings of joy and
regret" at leaving the editorship of the Daily is an
empty dream. Four and a half months on the job as
a final of three or four years of hard work is enough
for anyone and at the end of the last day you feel
like throwing up your hat and giving a hooray.
It is to be hoped that this gives some little light
into the work that we on the Daily have been trying
hard to do well for the last term. For the lack of
bad criticism and the help that we have gotten from
the student body and other readers we thank you all.

Today's issue is the last for this year. It also ends
the thirtieth year of the Daily Palo Alto as a Stan
ford publication. During that time the Daily has
come from a tiny four-column sheet to a real six
column standard paper. It compares favorably with
any of the other six-column papers of the colleges in
the country, and most of the great colleges still stick
to six columns instead of seven or eight as in city
journals.
The Daily in the last two or three years has been
getting away from political machinations and has
come to be a real student body activity with a staff
that is graded just the same as if it were 011 any
other organization representing the University.
The harmony which exists among the staff members
has been unbroken for the last year and everything
has gone smoothly as far as any dissension in the
staff is concerned. This has made the work of the
editor easier and easier at a time when he needed the
help of all the staff members.
The creation of an Editorial Board was looked
upon by many as a polite "shelf" for honorary mem
bers at the first of the present term. To the con
trary, the members of this board have been of the
greatest help. Bill Leiser has been a help in the mat
ter of editorial material whose loss would have
crippled the paper in the treatment of many subjects.
Harry Borba has spent practically as much time 011
the paper as he did when editor, and Mary Jane Clark
has stayed on to give her time to criticism work
where she was needed. All of these people have
given freely of their time and it has been appre
ciated.
As to the staff of the Daily, practically all the
members are men and women who have come on
since the beginning of the year. They have been
inexperienced in many cases and mistakes have re
sulted. The willingness to work has overcome this
in most cases. The women's end of the paper has
been especially well developed this year under the
guidance of Bertha Vaughan. She is one of the most
intelligent women journalists that the Daily has ever
had and is a good executive as well, and a pleasure
to work with.
This final editorial should have ended with a "lay
ing down of the editorial pen" and a few other
phrases from the hallowed past of journalism. To
day no one lays down any pens; probably he gets up
and leaves his typewriter without putting 011 the
cover. The stuff about "mingled feelings of joy and
regret" at leaving the editorship of the Daily is an
empty dream. Four and a half months on the job as
a final of three or four years of hard work is enough
for anyone and at the end of the last day you feel
like throwing up your hat and giving a hooray.
It is to be hoped that this gives some little light
into the work that we on the Daily have been trying
hard to do well for the last term. For the lack of
bad criticism and the help that we have gotten from
the student body and other readers we thank you all.
