Throughout the gardens of the new
Union, which will form the setting for
the Senior Ball dinner arrangements,
and the Women's Clubhouse in which
the dance is to be held a decorative
scheme will be carried out in conform
ity with the architecture of the Union
group buildings. George Eveleth's six
piece orchestra from San Francisco
has been secured for the ball.
Small tables seating four persons
will be placed around the lawns of
the court. Couples desiring a table
together must turn in their names at
the Bookstore jeither 'tomorrow or
Friday, and a seating list will be made
out accordingly. A dinner menu of
six courses has been planned by Miss
Handy, manager of the new Union,
and will be served directly from the
kitchens of the Union. Caiulelabras
will furnish light for the individual
tables.
The programs, designed by Janice
Dunker, will have a cover of white
leather stamped in black. The pro
grams may be procured at the Book
store the day before the ball.
Japanese lanterns of many colors
will be hung overhead in the court
yard. The given by the gar
dents of the court will be duplicated
as nearly as possible in the decora
tions of the clubhouse. Over the danc
ing floor will be a false ceiling of
green dotted with gay-colored lanterns.
The sides of the ballroom will be cov
ered with a mass of flowers and green
vines, with a large number of potted
plants around the edge of the floor.
On the floor of th 6 orchestra platform
will be a plot of grass, and further
carrying out the outside garden effect

canopy above the heads of the mu
sicians.
