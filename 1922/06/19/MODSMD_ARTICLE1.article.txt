# ADAM AND EVA IS CLAIMED BEST OF SENIOR COMEDIES
## Spontaneity of Action Brings Applause Throughout the Play; Catchy Plot Appeals 
### 
"The best Farce in years," was the
comment of everyone who saw the
Senior Farce "Adam and Eva," pre
sented in the Assembly Hall, last Wed
nesday evening. Wearied after three
strenuous days of exes the students
were enticed there by the name,
sible out of the play and assuredly
there was ample fun in its clever
lines.
While the name might indicate a
Will King revue and perhaps some
were enticed there under the name,
yet the play turned on a very material
subject. The plot centered about the
troubles of the millionaire rubber man,
James King in trying to curb his
family from their spendthrifty ways.
So disagreeable did this become to
his large family, mostly those who
"came to spend a week-end and stayed
fifteen years," that they finally plotted
to get him to go to South America
that they might continue their frenzied
finance in peace. The plot was bared
however and to foil the family, King
took the trip to the Amazon leaving
the hero of the story, Adam Smith, in
charge "in loco parentis." The re
mainder of the play dealt with the ef
forts and final success of Adam in
changing the family.
Robert Patton, '23, played the very
difficult part of the much imposed on
father. At all times he was the stern
man of finance and easily dominated
the scenes in which he appeared. The
part was the most difficult one of the
play as'no time could he be otherwise
than the nervous and impatient master
of finance.
"Little Eva" was played by Wanda
Leach, '22, in her initial appearance
on the Stanford stage. She proved her
self an actress of real ability and was
always the Eva contemplated by the
authors. Possessing a good stage ap
pearance and well modulated voice she
was easily the leading female char
acter of the play. In the vernacular
she could be termed a "find."
Roberta Barton as "Julie," the elder
daughter of the King house maintained
her part to the end, and made an
exceedingly- good wife for Hal Baum
baugh as Clinton DeWitt, who was
"taking a long time to go to work so
that he wouldn't make any mistake as
to the kind he wanted."
Dan Evans, '20, found time, in spite
of his position as Student Body Presi
dent, to be a very effective director
of the family ship after Mr. King left.
His naturalness was a refreshing part
of the play.
"Uncle Horace", the parasitic broth
er of Mr. King, found life in Hollis
Chalmers, '23. Always the ill and un
appreciated he furnished a very hu
morous touch to the play. His caustic
comments on the family's interest in
getting jobs were delightful.
Equally fine in his character part
was Bill Shields, '20, who represented
the remittance man from Scotch no
bility, who proved his worthiness on
the chicken farm in New Jersey. His
parting scene with Eva was one of
the cleverest bits of acting that the
Stanford stage has seen.
The fortune-hunting doctor was play
ed by Paul Talbert, '22, who in his
dress and appearance more resembled
a college half-back than a Doctor of
Medicine.
"Aunt Abbey" the sister-in-law was
played by Thelma Grace!, and she
made a pleasing part of the rather use
less role in the farce. She was
classed by King as "the sister of my
late wife" and lived up to the conven
tional type of sister-in-law.
Adoring Adam through the whole
play without having him see that she
cared much for him, Virginia Burks
handled the part of the counseling
maid to perfection. Her action was
just a little stiff but her pleasing per
sonality more than covered that.
The technical staff made another
score with the barnyard scene in the
third act. The little house and the
yard surrounding it made a pretty pic
lure which won instant applause.
