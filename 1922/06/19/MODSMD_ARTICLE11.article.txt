# THE
						SENIOR EDITION
## 
### 
This edition of the Daily Palo Alto is put out by the Senior Class
and is for the seniors and for their friends to keep as a souvenir of the
records and achievements of the class in its four years in college. The
men who have spoken at this commencement have brought a lesson to
the students that will last with them a long time if they paid attention
when the addresses were being made. They are here in full.
