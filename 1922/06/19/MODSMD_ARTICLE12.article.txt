# SAYING GOOD-BYE
## 
### 
Today we say good-bve to Stanford. Seven hundred and seventeen
receive degrees; many will not be back and some are only getting the
first of a number that they will have in the next few years. To those
of us who are leaving today marks a turning in our life. Perhaps it is
the biggest break that we will ever make. When we leave college for
the world of business or profession we are starting in an altogether dif
ferent sphere. Whether we make the success that is expected of us or
not depends in a large extent on the attitude that we take after leaving
here for he next few years. By then we will have shaped our path, and
so if we will succeed we must start, right, looking always forward, never
backward, as President Wilbur has said. Keeping the eyes always on the
goal ahead without looking too far, so that the vision becomes blurred
will bring us in time to the reward that we merit and will have if we
perform conscientiously.
