# THE
						SENIOR WEEK
## 
### 
In All Stanford Senior Week might be the name for the present one.
We have places on the campus now for the holding- of every sort of
function and have been able to keep all of the activities of the last week
here without detriment to anyone. It is fine to see the things being built
every day which make Stanford a place that can accommodate iteslf to
the tastes of all for all sorts of parties and meets. We are then con
stantly building up that homogeneity that goes so far toward welding
the bonds of the ever growing Stanford family.
