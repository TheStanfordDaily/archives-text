i While the air still reeked with powder smoke
• We came here. Twas just before
< The world shook off the yoke of war;
yj Our men had not yet broke
The hated line. All things were tense
And strained; a grim suspense
Clutched even at the bravest heart.
Boys, clad in khaki, rushed across the Quad.
Eager to be there where a man
Might do his part.
j Then
! War ceased: and with it fell
{ The ancient rule of dynasty.
I Above the turgid surge and swell
Of strife, rose up Humanity;
She broke and shared amongst mankind
i ' The powers and duties of the kings,
Hoping that men so blessed might build
; A newer, better state of things.
. -v ~«s«;
Four years! the breath of war is gone,
v* And we —old comrades —stand upon
The threshold of a golden dawn,
i Leaving behind us this, our home,
This haven of our hopes and joys,
: This sun-loved grove, this Stanford!
I Li other days great souls have passed
i' Beyond these walls; hearts that have beat
With noble and unselfish aim.
Now we, the youngest and the last
j To go, how shall we meet
i Our future? With care for selfish gain
Leading toward goals that make us brute?
j Or—hearing Humanity's deep call —
Shall we, like some who went before,
Answer, saying, "We are come!"
—Mollie Windish, '22.
