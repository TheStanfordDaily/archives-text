# THE 						UNBROKEN WILL OF '22
## 
### Tom Carskadon 
We the class of 1922 of Mr. Leland Stanford's Junior University, being
of sound body and infantile mind do hereby make, fake, execute, and perse
cute the following provisions of our last will and testament. Our will is iron
but our testament has deckled edges.
The end and aim of a University's existence is not to produce sound
scholars, nor rich alumni, nor even experienced queeners. Its highest pur
pose, as every rushing committee knows, is to produce a winning football
team.
And so to Dud DeGroot we leave the task of guiding the destinies of the
red-shirted warriors who represent the final product of higher education.
This is Dud's third year on the squad, he is a playef with ability and brains
and his election as captain will be a great asset to the Sigma Nu house. '
The things which,exist in greatest profusiton at Stanford are not classes
in Econ nor "Road Closed" signs but students. Any one of them will modestly
admit that the students form a I niversity's only excuse for existence. But
then, a poor excuse is better than none.
Thus the Grand High Guardian of Excuse otherwise known as Student
Body President, has a ticklish position to play. Phil Landis next year wilt
rate the trips to speak to the alumni clubs of Oroville, Eureka and Milpitas
and to him we leave a fluent speech and cast iron digestion for he will
need both.
The community sign board, otherwise known as the Daily Palo Alto, we
leave to Tom Irwin. For the first time in history it will be edited by a self
confessed and shameless snake and to him we further bequeath a merchan
dise order on the Owl Drug for Stacomb in unlimited quantities.
It is an ironic fact that athletics and the Daily Palo Alto enable each
other to keep alive. Thus we sap the very life blood or the Dippy when w*
go further into the field and mention Lister Lefty Rogers who will be th»»
leading man of the gang or basket-ball players next year. To him and hi*
gang of basket-ball players we leave the task of caging the ball often enough
to cage the Bear. I o Mr. George Green our behest is a life-sized portrait
or Methuselah for when he gets through being baseball Captain water will
running up-hHI, and Stanford will be offering a bonus instead of charging
tuition. Dick Hinckley we leave in charge of the tennis players with the hope
that the season will net him good returns. Lane Falk comes into his own
as leader of the Track Team, the proposition of competing in the Yale-Harvard-
Princeton Family squabble, the so-called I-C-4-A Meet, we leave to his sense
of humor. Various minor sports we leave in various hands, .all of them willing
and some o£ them capable.
Warren F. Lewis or should it be Warren F. Lewis Incorporated is in
trusted with the Chaparral in the hope that it may contain at least one
joke a month. Harry J. Borba tried out for the editorship of the Pictorial
We like the sample and we now give him the job of putting out our only
claim to rotogravure of the campus. Bob Binckley gets the Cardinal and
also our sympathy, and Paul H. Clyde we simply must compliment because as
alumni we shall all be sponsiring his infernal magazine, the Illustrated
Review.
Dramatics we entrust to Gordon Davis in the hope that more and more
students will take up his proposition of University Credit for shifting scenery.
Debating we were about to leave to the clerks in the book store but will
leave to Mr. J. G. Emerson instead, in the hope that an early marriage will
improve his talents. Other activities ranged from music to playing chess and
many of these we do a favor by simply leaving them in existence.
All activities eventually find their way into the Quad and in leaving the
previous Year-Book to Carl Shoup we charge him that he do not omit the
statistics for without them we leave no foot prints in the gravel of the Quad
and with them our children can say, "See my Papa was President of the
student Coal Heavers Club when he was in College" without going back
to the 1922 Quad td verify the statement.
The Presidency of the University we leave to the President of the Amer
ican Medical Association and our sincere wish is that he may continue suc
cessful in doctoring up remedies for the genuine good of the University. Comp
troller Roth, Doctor Elliott, and all the Officers and Administrators we leave?
brains and sagacity because we ourrselyes have such a surplus of these things.
And finally to those who have guided us along the paths of knowledge, to
those who form such unpromising raw material have made such brilliant
finished products, to the faculty we leave our sincere best wishes and heart
felt thanks.

The community sign board, otherwise known as the Daily Palo Alto, we

The end and aim of a University's existence is not to produce sound
scholars, nor rich alumni, nor even experienced queeners. Its highest pur

team.
And so to Dud DeGroot we leave the task of guiding the destinies of the
red-shirted warriors who represent the final product of higher education.
