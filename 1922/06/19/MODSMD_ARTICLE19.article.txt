# NEW UNION COURT IS ARTISTIC SETTING FOR SENIOR PROM
## 
### 
Once more the new Union proved its
worth when it furnished the background
for the 1922 Senior Prom. This year's
Prom proved to be one of the most suc
cessful of all those held since the found
ing of the University, and was certainly
held in the most beautiful place about
the University grounds.
No other place on the campus can fur
nish such a background of color as the
pretty flower beds around the court of
the Union, and no other place offers the
natural facilities for a pleasant time. The
court was large enough to take in all of
the large crowd that assembled there
and at the same time was small enough
to make it seem as if the crowd was all
contained in a real enclosure so that a
get-together feeling prevailed. The
many members of the class who had hot
met before were able to get together
there and meet each other before they
separated to go out into the world from
the University.
The decorations around and in the
court of the Union carried out the feel
ing of the day. Gay flowers and greens
of spring were strung about the walls
and on the interiors of the several build
ings and in the court, and in the evening
the lighting effects made a very beauti
ful picture.
