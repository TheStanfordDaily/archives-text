# "Tolerance Needed By World"—Taylor
## Head of Food Research Bureau Delivers Commencement Talk

When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
