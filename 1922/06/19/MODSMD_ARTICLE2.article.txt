# "Tolerance Needed By World"—Taylor
## Head of Food Research Bureau Delivers Commencement Talk 
### 
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni

it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en

lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of

young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu

the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.

The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis

been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These

democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac

The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our

to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern

International relations are now little

cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years

as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis

extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.

manistic researches is an obligation rest

the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug

The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it

.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum

gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more

tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be

The recent years have witnessed the vio

The success of democratic government

to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd

Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti

ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de

Americanization and democratization are

they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach

one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be

been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni

it was always tacitly assumed that only

Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis

German pedagogists often criticized Eng

stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop

is pedantry to school youths as though

have talent for leadership, few have ca

into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of

Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu

the English educational system has fur

the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed

creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra

tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the

youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in

ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak

and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan

gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more

tal and technical movements must not

must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast

forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher

The second lesson of the war is re

is not enough that a democracy should

International relations are now little

seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de

and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of

racy is larger than the obligation to na

Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So

The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag

The third lesson of the war is reaf

search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat

social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak

The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis

knowledge from the book and placed it

.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so

is incumbent upon institutions of higher

The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa

democracy is felt by those only who be

to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern

International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the

grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir

one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of

it was always tacitly assumed that only

German pedagogists often criticized Eng

stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn

students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop

is pedantry to school youths as though

have talent for leadership, few have ca

into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally

qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful

Those qualities in the majority of stu

attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu

the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed

creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex

youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
When President Wilbur called on me
to address you 011 this occasion, he ad
vised me that the platform of Com
mencement Exercises in Stanford Uni
versity is a forum. The subject of the
relation of education to society is ever
one of impelling interest. The formula
of education is not a mathematical equa
tion. The edifice of education is not a
structure of fixed design or prescribed
dimensions. Times change, new environ
ments develop, social needs are modified
and enlarged. The younger generation
feels first the spirit of change. The
mentality of youth is highly sensitized.
It reacts with little analysis. The older
generation must make the analysis. The
reactions of youth are signs of deep so
cial sifnificance. The spirit of youth is
in each generation a new inquiry into
the nature of consciousness and conduct.
Institutions of education should sense
the first surge of change in order to
mediate between the new and the old,
and effect the transition to new institu

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.

and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan

tal and technical movements must not

viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher

The second lesson of the war is re

is not enough that a democracy should

International relations are now little

seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de

and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na

Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So

The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus

body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf

search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis

tions in an orderly manner. To the stu
dent, higher education represents an op
portunity. For the University, educa
tion represents an obligation. This ob
ligation does not rest on contract. It is
founded on conscience. In fulfilling this
obligation, the University is obliged to
take full cognizance of the spirit of the
time and make her offerings representa
tive of the possessions and needs of the
age. Dogmatism is not guidance. Edu
cation is the form o fevolution through
which a new spirit attains realization in
knowledge and conduct. The colleges
and universities stand necessarily on
the borderland of social and intellectual
change. The tree of innovation grows
on every campus. It is our function to
icquip aspiration with the technique of
accomplishment.
The history of alumni of American in
stitutions of higher learning confirms
the experience of faculties, that students
are divided into two groups : one possess
ing creative capacities, the other en
dowed with talents of a supplemental
character. The proportion of students
possessing creative capacities is small.
One of the difficult problems of the
University, not always consciously real
ized, is to provide proper educational
facilities for both groups. In Germany
it was always tacitly assumed that only
individuals with creative capacities en
rolled in the philosophical faculty of the
universit yand the methods of instruc
tion were based on this hypothesis. Our
colleges and universities have often
leaned in the same direction. The Eng
lish universities have more clearly en
visaged teh distinction. They have in
Oxford and Cambridge the honor group
and the rank and file of students, a dis
tinction brought to its highest expres
sion in the Wrangler of Cambridge.
German pedagogists often criticized Eng
lish education as not laying sufficient
stress on the training of the creative fac
ulties, overlooking the scholar in edu
cating the gentleman. The German uni
versity overlooked the gentleman in edu
cating the scholar ,and forced men with
out creative capacities into work de
signed only for students fitted for orig
inal scholarship. The experiences of
the present government in Germany
demonstrate clearly that the German uni
versity did not educate for citizenship,
social service or political leadership.
It is vain for faculties and curricula
to pretend that our institutions of learn
ing make scholars out of the majority of
students. Creative capacities are inborn,
in the first instance; to a large extent,
however, they are dependent for develop
ment on conditions of environment. It
is pedantry to school youths as though
all possessed creative facutlies. Many
have talent for leadership, few have ca
pacity for research. The war brought
into sharp relief certain qualities in
graduates of American colleges and uni
versities that may be reasonably attrib
uted in good part to residence in college.
To large numbers of young men the war
presented problems for which they had
not been trained and undertakings to
which they brought no experience. The
American Relief Administration had a
favorable opportunity to study in Eu
rope the capacities of American college
graduates. We saw frequently men of
totally different training doing equally
well a task that was entirely new. The
qualities that stood out were initiative,
adaptability, self-reliance and forceful
ness. For this group of characteristics
we have no noun, outside of the vernacu
lar, but the type is familiar to every man
in position of executive direction of
young Americans.
Those qualities in the majority of stu
dents whose efforts in life are destined
to be supplemental and not original, de
mand training and arc susceptible of
marged development, though advance
ment cannot be expressed in grades. The
attempt to do so leads to scrambling for
the "cum laudc' on the part of the stu
dent, —and on the part of the teacher to
the use of decimals in the attempt to
define a cum laude. No one can visit
Oxford or Cambridge without being im
pressed with what may be termed edu
cation of the personality : — rational
sturdiness, objectiveness, the faculty of
keeping the feet on the ground and the
head in the air. Since Sir Isaac Newton,
the English educational system has fur
nished an unbroken procession of physi
cists of the very first rank, creative
spirits to whom their system of cduca
tion afforded free opportunity for de
velopment. Down the same line of years,
the English universities have been able
to give, on the same campus, to succeed
ing generations of boys who possessed no
creative faculties ,the qualities of char
acter that have constituted the vertebra
of the English skeleton. Our institu
tions of learning often fail to influence
personality, because we attempt too ex
plicit an education of certain functions of
the brain. A man may be educated but
not intelligent, he may possess wide ac
quaintance with assembled facts and re
main incapable of social co-operation, he
may have cultivated tastes but be devoid
of civic principles. Combined in con
duct arc the impulse of desire and the
sense of achievement, the former the ex
pression of feeling, the latter of reason
ing. It is during the collegiate years that
youths learn to interpret conduct in
others and habits in themselves. We do
not wish single-track minds but we do
need single-track wills. We demand of
the world broad scope for individual in
itiative. The university has the same ob
ligation.
Let us formulate a system of under
graduate education designed to meet our
dualistic needs. Accepting the division
of the four collegiate years into upper
and lower divsions, one would have the
work of the lower division separated into
obligatory and elective groups. The seg
regation of the subjects looks more im
portant than it really is, because person
alities of outstanding teachers will deter
mine student choice more than system of
classification. The grading of thorough
going student work in the lower division
would be passed or failed. At the be
ginning of the upper division, students
who so desire would enroll themselves
as candidates for honors. Students not
enrolled as candidates for honors, would
pursue two upper years of work, largely
■elective, according to a group arrange
ment. The grading of this work, sub
stantive and not syllabic, would be passed
or failed. Students electing honors would
be given different instruction and assume
heavier work. Instead of a minimum of
13 hours, the minimum for a student
•electing honors might be 18 hours, and
the character of instruction would be
adapted to the aspiration of scholarship.
Students not electing honors would have
a schedule so flexible as to offer oppor
tunity of participation in student affairs,
debating, dramatics, music, art, journal
ism, physical culture and sports. The
student electing honors would enter upon
,extra-scholastic activities at his option
and risk. A third to a half of the stu
dent's time is known to be devoted to
extra-scholastic activities. Those should
be made constructive and efficent. Next
to the work impulse, the play impulse
deserves development. True work and
true play, without sloth and triviality. It
*is proper for students to work at their
play, but reprehensible to paly at their
work. Such a system would have clarity
of purpose in every direction and lead to
appropriate recognition of the charac
teristics of students of the two types.
Such a curriculum would hold advant
ages for both groups of students and
terminate the unconscious hypocrisy that
at present resides in curricula that pre
tend to regard all students as candidates
for higher scholarship.
A university of limited student num
bers possesses great advantages in selec
tion of students and development of in
struction. The student body is to be rep
resentative in all branches of academic
work. The system of admission to an
institution of limited students must avoid
rigid classification of entrance require
ments. Students cannot be classified like
crystals. What may be termed dynamic
fluidity is to be maintained in the in
stitution. Grading of commodities is of
great importance in marketing them. But
the out-turn of preparatory schools can
not be thus graded for delivery to col
leges and universities. The desired cri
teria for admission to a university of
limied attendance cannot all be set down
in numbers on paper. Grades of pre
paratory schools, very important if prop
erly evaluated, may not constitute the
sole criteria of quality in applicants for
admission. Several schools of medicine
in American universities have now had
two decades of experience in the selec
tion of limited numbers of students.
These institutions have come* to rely
more and more on recommendations of
selected teachers. Personal recommenda
tions are found to possess greater value
than the grades presented by the student.
The system rests on confidential contact
with outstanding teachers. In this man
ner it is found possible to separate rea
soning students from memorizing stu
dents. In order to select students, Stan
ford University cannot stand behind the
boundary line of the campus and assay
students after they appear. In scrutiniz
ing the qualities of entering students, we
should search for signs of reasoning
powers and not be misled by precocious
memorization. We should secure stu
dents of initiative, resourcefulness and
character; individuals possessing leader
ship in student esteem as well as in re
corded academic standards. The stand
point and character of Stanford Uni
versity must be made understood in pre
paratory schools and high schools, in
order that oncoming students and their
parents shall in advance appreciate the
ideals and purpose of this institution.

Each year shall witness a deepening and
broadening of the established esprit de
corps of the institution, each graduate
must envisage his obligation to the
maintenance of Stanford morale. The
application for admission ought to ex
press conversion to our ideals. In this
way we may hope to develop scholarship
and leadership side by side.
It is unthinkable that one should speak
of the benefits of war, intolerable to sug
gest that human progress depends upon
mass sacrifice of living beings. It is
appalling to realize how easy it is to de
mand discipline for purposes of destruc
tion, how difficult to cultivate discipline
for purposes of construction. Neverthe
less, wars have taught salutory lessons.
The Great War accelerated the progress
of existing knowledge and led to dis
covery of new knowledge. War took
knowledge from the book and placed it
in life, —and in death. Three lessons for
.education may be drawn from the war,
and these must not fail of application,
because the price paid has been so heavy.
Knowledge has acquired a more quan
titative complexion. The social sciences
stood before the war where the physical
sciences stood forty years ago. The so
cial sciences stand today where the phy
sical sciences stood when they first
adopted the dynamic point of view. For
each discipline there is a quantum
theory. This is to become as important
for economics, sociology, psychology, ed
ucation and history as for physics. It is
as logical, and necessary, to define and
measure human motives, conduct and ac
complishments in discrete units as to de
fine energy in quanta. Adapting peda
gogic procedures to this end means more
of training and less of information, more
of quantitative method and less of quali
tative fact, more of reasoning and less of
memory. Economic, social, governmen
tal and technical movements must not
only be analyzed and measured, they
must be forecasted. It is unthinkable
that we should be content to forecast
stars and weather and not attempt to
forecast human conduct. This general
viewpoint must be expected to hold to
greater or less extent in all subjects: it
is incumbent upon institutions of higher
learning to inculcate this viewpoint and
give students the training the world is
certain to expect in them. The prob
lems of restoration and reconstruction
of the world have given an added em
phasis to this conclusion.
The second lesson of the war is re
affirmation of the obligation of educa
tion to democracy. An obligation to
democracy is felt by those only who be
lieve in it as the future iorm of society.
The recent years have witnessed the vio
lent origin of new democracies. His
torically, democracies have arisen by se
cession or revolution against monarchis
tic oppression. At the close of the late
war, ten democracies sprang into being
,in Europe as result of disruption. In no
one of these countries had public senti
ment or capacity for citizenship been
evolved to the plane of a republican form
of government. The educational sys
tems were not adapted to the tenets of
democracy. This statement is as true of
Germany as of Poland. Seldom in mod
ern history has governmental incapacity
been more glaringly illustrated than in
the affairs of the new democracies. These
governments possess little internal au
thority and less external standing. Un
der these circumstances, the theory of
democratic government is on trial in
Europe in a sense never before known.
The success of democratic government
in Switzerland and France is not ac
cepted as precedent. The case of Swit
zerland is very special. France is no
more of a democracy than is Great Brit
ain, the forms of government being al
most identical, except that the figure
head of the French government is elec

tive, that in Great Britain hereditary.
The only democracy that can serve as
example in Europe are the United States.
We have been chiefly concerned that
our democracy should make good to our
seleves. It must be our equal concern
to serve as demonstration to the world.
is not enough that a democracy should
afford the citizens good internal govern
ment. It is essential that it should func
tion efficiently in international affairs.
International relations are now little
more than shambles. The new democra
cies of Europe are confronted with what
seem almost inextricable confusions. The
United States have failed in a program
of hypothetical leadership. Two con
tests proceed in Europe side by side: the
contest of nationalism, overdrawn and
exaggerated as result of victory and de
feat; and the contest between democracy
and despotism. That a country can flee
from despotism, only to miss democracy
and fall into new despotism, is illustrated
in Russia. The new democracies of Eu
rope face the same danger,—reversion to
the pre-war status or degradation to the
level of Russia. The international prob
lem seems to involve a choice between
an oligarchy of the English-speaking
countries and the free development of
democracies. The obligation to democ
racy is larger than the obligation to na
tionalism.
Internally, our form of government
and our formulation of society were
never more on trial than at present. So
far as the institutions of higher learning
are concerned, this is due to a consider
able extent to congestion. Twenty years
ago, it was a commonplace to deplore the
existence of so many half-filled colleges
and universities. Today practically all
colleges and universities are overcrowd
ed. This rush into institutions of higher
learning may be compared to immigra
tion. In the twenty years before the
war our country received more immi
grants than we could assimilate. A so
cial melting pot, like the crucible of an
assayer, can handle only so much raw
material. We failed to assimilate and
Americanize the flood of immigrants, to
their detriment and to ours. The insti
tutions of higher learning are a melting
pot, into them are poured graduates from
public and private high schools, proceed
ing largely from groups in our population
that never before enjoyed the advantages
of higher education, just as immigrants
had not enjoyed the advantages of de
mocracy. A large percentage of citizen
undergraduates are as alien as the for
eign students that come to our univer
sities. The entering freshman, whence
soever derived, must be taught that
Americanization and democratization are
functions of collegiate education. Aca
demic scholasticism is not democracy. If,
during the collegiate course, students at
tain inner consciousness of the meaning
of our government and form of society,
they will have obtained something quite
as important as assembled information
and cultured tastes. Such attainment by
students is only possible if faculties have
faith in democracy, express this in daily
living, exert it continuously in relations
with students and incorporate it into pol
icies of student control.
The great need in the world today is
tolerance. The war has left in mankind
the spirit of contention. We see antag
onisms between continents, countries,
city and town, classes, ages, sexes, trus
tees and teachers, faculty and student
body, parents and children. Education
must send youths into the strife-stricken
world endowed with tolerance and be
nevolence. We must secure authority
without intolerance, discipline without
bureaucracy, freedom without license,
opportunity without exploitation.
The third lesson of the war is reaf
firmation of the value of original re
search. The physical sciences are en
gaged in unusually extensive and impor

taut programs of investigation, of which
that dealing with the constitution of mat
ter is the most prominent. The humanis
tic disciples are engaged in intensive and
extensive investigation of the data of
human conduct during the past ten years.
Participation in these scienctific and hu
manistic researches is an obligation rest
ing on every university. If the work is
to be pushed forward, fresh forces must
be added annually to the corps of work
ers. Each university must uncover and
develop creative capacities in students, in
order to do her share of the work. It is
a legitimate expectation of the student
that every facility* shall be granted for
development in this direction. The spirit
of research needs training but not regu
lation, discipline but not restriction. Re
search cannot be developed after the
method of the counting-house. There is
much individualism in research. Cur
ricula must be so flexible as to offer as
piring students opportunity for growth.
In some individuals creative talent stands
out in the nursery, in others in the pri
mary school, in others in the secondary
school, in others in the college, in some
individuals the capacity comes to fruition
only in later years. To some of these,
collegiate life denied opportunity. Others
required the influence of environment in
the stress of life. In order that aspir
ing minds should have free opportunities
to seek contacts, the services of all teach
ers should be available to all students, in
one way or another, throughout all col
legiate years. Heads of departments
should not reserve their pedagogic ef
forts for seniors; freshmen offer the
best field for inspiration. The faculty
must be plastic, catholic and tolerant.
The creative spirit in the faculty must
be nurtured; it is the lodestone that
draws out the creative talent of youth.
In my opinion the discovery and culti
vation of creative capacity is so impor
tant that university departments ought to
possess the right to lift students of un
usual endowment out of the curriculum,
train them on a special status within the
department and graduate them when
they have completed the allotted time of
the collegiate course. I am quite sure
such a system would be seldom abused
and convinced creative talent would be
discovered and developed in this way.
Persuaded that at no time in the his
tory of the world has creative capacity
been so precious as it is today, it is our
obligation persistently to stress efforts
in the liberation of such talent. Uni
versities are to be judged according as
they aid to convert creative talent into
creative accomplishment.
