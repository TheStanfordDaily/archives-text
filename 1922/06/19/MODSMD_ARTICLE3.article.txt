# DAN GOODMAN GIVES[illegible] ORATION AT ANNUAL CLASS DAY SERVICES
## 
### 
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Classmen, Ladies
and Gentlemen:
It is for the last time that we have
assembled as a class of undergraduates*
and, in a sense, for the first time as a
class of alumni. Whatever our hopes
and expectations as to the future may be,
it is with a common feeling of regret that
we leave the place of which we have
come to feel that wc are an essential part.
While we are observing the last honors
of this class as an active part of univer
sity life, we are ushering in a new class
as an addition to Stanford's reserve fund
of alumni support.
But however much I might desire to
increase our sense of duty and loyalty
to our university, a mere exhortation on
my part would be futile to that end. For
a sense of loyalty is not created by mere
words, but by active conduct in the form
of service or sacrifice in behalf of one's
university. A sense of duty to, and a
love for, one's school is not a mere men
tal recognition of the presence of a duty,
but consists primarily in a feeling of
emotion slowly but deeply rooted by a
long association with, and service to,
one's university. Representation of one's
school on the athletic field, or in the
bleachers, or in any other form of ac
tivity, or by a subscription to our en
dowment fund, makes one a more loyal
Stanford supporters, but mere words,
never.
Heretofore we have been recipients of
the benefits of our school, but now we
should become its supporters, not only
in actively aiding it, but also in being
\vorthy of it. A university is judged by
its product; it can be no stronger than
its alumni. A good citizen is the best
alumnus.
The highest fulfillment of one's duty
to his school is in the adoption and ful
fillment of its ideals. The university is
a social institution, maintained at great
expense by the outside world, for a pur
pose. That purpose is to produce better
citizens: men and women who can hold
ideals, have courage to push them "over
the hump," and who have the trained
minds essential to grasp and meet the
difficulties of social organization,
whether political, social, or economic.
The proof of the capacity of an athletic
trainer lies in the records of his men;
the proof of the capacity of the univer
sity as an instrument of social improve
ment lies in the records of its citizens.
The highest duty to one's university lies
in the duties of citizenship.
A true conception of the function and
potentialities of the university is essen
tial to a full effectuation of its useful
ness. It cannot accomplish the insuper
able, though some seem to think it can;
nor is it a failure, as others believe. An
understanding of the purposes and uses
of education would serve to dispel the
surprisingly common and widely vary
ing beliefs of what it will do for the stu
dent. Some think that an education gives
one a first lien mortgage on success,
while others think that it is a millstone
on the neck of a struggling swimmer.
Tt must be remembered that education
does not create, but only develops. Men
are born not made. Fools and incom
petents remain such after an education.
A bundle of tin, wire and rubber will
become a Ford whether it is sent through
the Ford or the Packard factory. And
consequently, we have "tin models" run
ning around in our universities just as
we have in the outside world. Those
who believe that an education is an.open
sesame to all that is desirable, and those
who believe that education is a dead
weight, make the same mistake, the for
mer believing that education will make
the man, and the latter believing that it
should do so, and is a failure because
they have observed that it does not.
The university, as other stages of edu
cation, uncovers and develops latent
qualities ,but if those potentialities are
not present the university can do noth
ing for him. The purpose of the univer
sity is to give the student an intellectual
training and to plant in him higher ideals
of social duty and honesty. But some
seem to believe that the primary purpose
of the university is to simply give him
such an intellectual preparation as will
enable him to bette rconipete with others
in attaining his own private ambitions.
They forget that the university must do
something more, that mere intellectual
capacity is not everything. There is that
undefinable something about a man,
which defies analysis, but which causes
us to recognize in him the true gentle
man, irrespective of whether his skin be
red, yellow, or black, irrespective of
whether he be an engine-wiper or a
United States senator, and irrespective
of what his creeds, beliefs or social status
may be. It is this which causes us to,
say that "A man is a man wherever you
find him." This undefinable something
we call character. By character we do
not mean mere honesty, however impor
tant that may be. We mean a composite
of qualities: honor, ambition, courage,
a sense of duty and loyalty, sympathy,
and kindness. It is the possession of
these qualities which causes us to call
a man a true man although he may stand
with his hat on in the presence of ladies,
or eat potatoes with his knife. Charac
ter is the steel and concrete foundation
on which has been erected every great
life edifice of history, and it is the same
foundation upon which is built the life
of every successful citizen. Character
is the driving power behind a man; it is
the balance wheel of his conduct, and
the steering wheel of his actions.
There must first of all be ambition.
A 200-ton locomotive without steam will
not push a feather off the track, and
similarly, a man with a fine training and
great ability, but without ambition, will
be equally impotent. Ability unused is
ability non existent.
But ability used to a wrongful pur
pose is a driverless engine run amuck.
Ability used to a wrongful purpose is
worse than no ability at all. An edu
cated and college trained man without
duty or honor is more dangerous to so
ciety than one without such training. It
is said that there is a greater proportion
of college trained men in prison than of
any other important class of men in the
nation. This does not mean that an edu
cation destroys honor or character, but
simply means that, since university men
have greater opportunities and respon
sibilities .the are open to more tempeta
tions. The university must develop the
sense of duty and honor proportionately
training and capacity.
But ambition and honor are not
enough. We must have the man of ini
tiative, a self-winder, a man who starts
things, and who does not wait till they
start him. Progress comes from the few
to the many. Leadership is always in the
minority and the price of its inconven
ience must be paid. But its reward lies
in the self satisfaction which is a con
sciousness of a duty fulfilled.
And .above all, we want men who will
not stop when knocked down, nor seek
a truce with difficulty. Courage is
necessary to pass the ruts and chuck
holes of life. Courage is the endurance
of character under fire.
The university cannot create these
qualities of character any more than it
can latent intellectual ability. They come
from the man himself. But education
can give him a mental and moral train
ing which will better qualify him to serve
himself, his family and his community.
A trained intellect is a fine tool by
which Character, the master workman,
can do a better job of life.
An essential of character is high ideals
and vision. And if the university, espe
cially in our cultural courses, does not
give the student higher conceptions and
constructive ideals as to his duties as a
citizen or public official, it is a partial
failure. Out of these ideals is born a
sense of duty and unselfishness. Sel
fishness and a spirit of service are not
bed-fellows and the university must
broaden the sense of social duty. We
have all observed the apparent anomaly
of the crooked political boss who, toward
his family and personal associates, is a
model of unquestioned integrity and un
selfishness, but who would rob the pub
lic out of its bottom dollar. This is due
to the fact that he did not feel the latter
to be really wrong; he could not see far
enough to feel that it violated his code
of morals. And before it can be said
that the university has succeeded in its
full function it must create in its grad
uates a broader and deeper vision of
their place in social life, both as citizens
and public leaders.

We must remember that we have, as
yet, done nothing. So far our lives have
been a period of preparation, and, by all
theories of equity, since society has done
so much more on us than on the average
individual, it has a right to expect cor
respondingly more of us. We are told
that the Chevrolet and Ford cars are
given only a few comparatively lenient
tests before they are put on the market,
while the Packard is given twenty-six
severe tests, and if it does not meet them
it is thrown into the junk heap. There is
expected from us a contribution to so
ciety in proportion to the time and ef
fort put into us. An education accepted
is a debt unpaid. Our course of action
is clearly indicated.
If we do not meet the tests of social
duty the university is a poor social in
vestment. The problems of government
and industry, such as capital and labor,
are vastl ymore numerous and complex
today than they ever were before, and
they are awaiting a solution. If the col
lege trained man cannot contribute to
their settlement in some appreciable de
gree, both as critical and intelligent citi
zens andas public leaders, the university
is a failure.
Remembering that the function of our
universities is the fulfillment of the so
cial purpose of making better citizens,
and also remembering that the greatest
loyalty to one's university lies in a loy
alty to its real purpose and ideals, and
remembering that we have, as yet. bee* 1
only consumers and not producers, and
that more is justly expected of us than of
those without a college education, the
challenge of duty becomes clearly and
â€¢obviously apparent.

the benefits of our school, but now we
should become its supporters, not only
in actively aiding it, but also in being
\vorthy of it. A university is judged by
its product; it can be no stronger than
its alumni. A good citizen is the best
alumnus.
The highest fulfillment of one's duty
to his school is in the adoption and ful
fillment of its ideals. The university is
a social institution, maintained at great
expense by the outside world, for a pur
pose. That purpose is to produce better
citizens: men and women who can hold
ideals, have courage to push them "over
the hump," and who have the trained
minds essential to grasp and meet the
difficulties of social organization,
whether political, social, or economic.
The proof of the capacity of an athletic
trainer lies in the records of his men;
the proof of the capacity of the univer
sity as an instrument of social improve
ment lies in the records of its citizens.
The highest duty to one's university lies
in the duties of citizenship.
A true conception of the function and
potentialities of the university is essen
tial to a full effectuation of its useful
ness. It cannot accomplish the insuper
able, though some seem to think it can;
nor is it a failure, as others believe. An
understanding of the purposes and uses
of education would serve to dispel the
surprisingly common and widely vary
ing beliefs of what it will do for the stu
dent. Some think that an education gives
one a first lien mortgage on success,
while others think that it is a millstone
on the neck of a struggling swimmer.
Tt must be remembered that education
does not create, but only develops. Men
are born not made. Fools and incom
petents remain such after an education.
A bundle of tin, wire and rubber will
become a Ford whether it is sent through
the Ford or the Packard factory. And
consequently, we have "tin models" run
ning around in our universities just as
we have in the outside world. Those
who believe that an education is an.open
sesame to all that is desirable, and those
who believe that education is a dead
weight, make the same mistake, the for
mer believing that education will make
the man, and the latter believing that it
should do so, and is a failure because
they have observed that it does not.
The university, as other stages of edu
cation, uncovers and develops latent
qualities ,but if those potentialities are
not present the university can do noth
ing for him. The purpose of the univer
sity is to give the student an intellectual
training and to plant in him higher ideals
of social duty and honesty. But some
seem to believe that the primary purpose
of the university is to simply give him
such an intellectual preparation as will
enable him to bette rconipete with others
in attaining his own private ambitions.
They forget that the university must do
something more, that mere intellectual
capacity is not everything. There is that
undefinable something about a man,
which defies analysis, but which causes
us to recognize in him the true gentle
man, irrespective of whether his skin be
red, yellow, or black, irrespective of
whether he be an engine-wiper or a
United States senator, and irrespective
of what his creeds, beliefs or social status
may be. It is this which causes us to,
say that "A man is a man wherever you
find him." This undefinable something
we call character. By character we do
not mean mere honesty, however impor
tant that may be. We mean a composite
of qualities: honor, ambition, courage,
a sense of duty and loyalty, sympathy,
and kindness. It is the possession of
these qualities which causes us to call
a man a true man although he may stand
with his hat on in the presence of ladies,
or eat potatoes with his knife. Charac
ter is the steel and concrete foundation
on which has been erected every great
life edifice of history, and it is the same
foundation upon which is built the life
of every successful citizen. Character
is the driving power behind a man; it is
the balance wheel of his conduct, and
the steering wheel of his actions.
There must first of all be ambition.
A 200-ton locomotive without steam will
not push a feather off the track, and
similarly, a man with a fine training and
great ability, but without ambition, will
be equally impotent. Ability unused is
ability non existent.
But ability used to a wrongful pur
pose is a driverless engine run amuck.
Ability used to a wrongful purpose is
worse than no ability at all. An edu
cated and college trained man without
duty or honor is more dangerous to so
ciety than one without such training. It
is said that there is a greater proportion
of college trained men in prison than of
any other important class of men in the
nation. This does not mean that an edu
cation destroys honor or character, but
simply means that, since university men
have greater opportunities and respon
sibilities .the are open to more tempeta
tions. The university must develop the
sense of duty and honor proportionately
training and capacity.
But ambition and honor are not
enough. We must have the man of ini
tiative, a self-winder, a man who starts
things, and who does not wait till they
start him. Progress comes from the few
to the many. Leadership is always in the
minority and the price of its inconven
ience must be paid. But its reward lies
in the self satisfaction which is a con
sciousness of a duty fulfilled.
And .above all, we want men who will
not stop when knocked down, nor seek
a truce with difficulty. Courage is
necessary to pass the ruts and chuck
holes of life. Courage is the endurance
of character under fire.
The university cannot create these
qualities of character any more than it
can latent intellectual ability. They come
from the man himself. But education
can give him a mental and moral train
ing which will better qualify him to serve
himself, his family and his community.
A trained intellect is a fine tool by
which Character, the master workman,
can do a better job of life.
An essential of character is high ideals
and vision. And if the university, espe
cially in our cultural courses, does not
give the student higher conceptions and
constructive ideals as to his duties as a
citizen or public official, it is a partial
failure. Out of these ideals is born a
sense of duty and unselfishness. Sel
fishness and a spirit of service are not
bed-fellows and the university must
broaden the sense of social duty. We
have all observed the apparent anomaly
of the crooked political boss who, toward
his family and personal associates, is a
model of unquestioned integrity and un
selfishness, but who would rob the pub
lic out of its bottom dollar. This is due
to the fact that he did not feel the latter
to be really wrong; he could not see far
enough to feel that it violated his code
of morals. And before it can be said
that the university has succeeded in its
full function it must create in its grad
uates a broader and deeper vision of
their place in social life, both as citizens
and public leaders.

We must remember that we have, as
yet, done nothing. So far our lives have
been a period of preparation, and, by all
theories of equity, since society has done
so much more on us than on the average
individual, it has a right to expect cor
respondingly more of us. We are told
that the Chevrolet and Ford cars are
given only a few comparatively lenient
tests before they are put on the market,
while the Packard is given twenty-six
severe tests, and if it does not meet them
it is thrown into the junk heap. There is
expected from us a contribution to so
ciety in proportion to the time and ef
fort put into us. An education accepted
is a debt unpaid. Our course of action
is clearly indicated.
If we do not meet the tests of social
duty the university is a poor social in
vestment. The problems of government
and industry, such as capital and labor,
are vastl ymore numerous and complex
today than they ever were before, and
they are awaiting a solution. If the col
lege trained man cannot contribute to
their settlement in some appreciable de
gree, both as critical and intelligent citi
zens andas public leaders, the university
is a failure.
Remembering that the function of our
universities is the fulfillment of the so
cial purpose of making better citizens,
and also remembering that the greatest
loyalty to one's university lies in a loy
alty to its real purpose and ideals, and
remembering that we have, as yet. bee* 1
only consumers and not producers, and
that more is justly expected of us than of
those without a college education, the
challenge of duty becomes clearly and
â€¢obviously apparent.
D. L. GOODMAN.
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Classmen, Ladies
and Gentlemen:
It is for the last time that we have
assembled as a class of undergraduates*
and, in a sense, for the first time as a
class of alumni. Whatever our hopes
and expectations as to the future may be,
it is with a common feeling of regret that
we leave the place of which we have
come to feel that wc are an essential part.
While we are observing the last honors
of this class as an active part of univer
sity life, we are ushering in a new class
as an addition to Stanford's reserve fund
of alumni support.
But however much I might desire to
increase our sense of duty and loyalty
to our university, a mere exhortation on
my part would be futile to that end. For
a sense of loyalty is not created by mere
words, but by active conduct in the form
of service or sacrifice in behalf of one's
university. A sense of duty to, and a
love for, one's school is not a mere men
tal recognition of the presence of a duty,
but consists primarily in a feeling of
emotion slowly but deeply rooted by a
long association with, and service to,
one's university. Representation of one's
school on the athletic field, or in the
bleachers, or in any other form of ac
tivity, or by a subscription to our en
dowment fund, makes one a more loyal
Stanford supporters, but mere words,
never.

while others think that it is a millstone
on the neck of a struggling swimmer.
Tt must be remembered that education
does not create, but only develops. Men
are born not made. Fools and incom
petents remain such after an education.
A bundle of tin, wire and rubber will
become a Ford whether it is sent through
the Ford or the Packard factory. And
consequently, we have "tin models" run
ning around in our universities just as
we have in the outside world. Those
who believe that an education is an.open
sesame to all that is desirable, and those
who believe that education is a dead
weight, make the same mistake, the for
mer believing that education will make
the man, and the latter believing that it
should do so, and is a failure because
they have observed that it does not.
The university, as other stages of edu
cation, uncovers and develops latent
qualities ,but if those potentialities are
not present the university can do noth
ing for him. The purpose of the univer
sity is to give the student an intellectual
training and to plant in him higher ideals
of social duty and honesty. But some
seem to believe that the primary purpose
of the university is to simply give him
such an intellectual preparation as will
enable him to bette rconipete with others
in attaining his own private ambitions.
They forget that the university must do
something more, that mere intellectual
capacity is not everything. There is that
undefinable something about a man,
which defies analysis, but which causes
us to recognize in him the true gentle
man, irrespective of whether his skin be
red, yellow, or black, irrespective of
whether he be an engine-wiper or a
United States senator, and irrespective
of what his creeds, beliefs or social status
may be. It is this which causes us to,
say that "A man is a man wherever you
find him." This undefinable something
we call character. By character we do
not mean mere honesty, however impor
tant that may be. We mean a composite
of qualities: honor, ambition, courage,
a sense of duty and loyalty, sympathy,
and kindness. It is the possession of
these qualities which causes us to call
a man a true man although he may stand
with his hat on in the presence of ladies,
or eat potatoes with his knife. Charac
ter is the steel and concrete foundation
on which has been erected every great
life edifice of history, and it is the same
foundation upon which is built the life
of every successful citizen. Character
is the driving power behind a man; it is
the balance wheel of his conduct, and
the steering wheel of his actions.
There must first of all be ambition.
A 200-ton locomotive without steam will
not push a feather off the track, and
similarly, a man with a fine training and
great ability, but without ambition, will
be equally impotent. Ability unused is
ability non existent.
But ability used to a wrongful pur
pose is a driverless engine run amuck.
Ability used to a wrongful purpose is
worse than no ability at all. An edu
cated and college trained man without
duty or honor is more dangerous to so
ciety than one without such training. It
is said that there is a greater proportion
of college trained men in prison than of
any other important class of men in the
nation. This does not mean that an edu
cation destroys honor or character, but
simply means that, since university men
have greater opportunities and respon
sibilities .the are open to more tempeta
tions. The university must develop the
sense of duty and honor proportionately
training and capacity.
But ambition and honor are not
enough. We must have the man of ini
tiative, a self-winder, a man who starts
things, and who does not wait till they
start him. Progress comes from the few
to the many. Leadership is always in the
minority and the price of its inconven
ience must be paid. But its reward lies
in the self satisfaction which is a con
sciousness of a duty fulfilled.
And .above all, we want men who will
not stop when knocked down, nor seek
a truce with difficulty. Courage is
necessary to pass the ruts and chuck
holes of life. Courage is the endurance
of character under fire.
The university cannot create these
qualities of character any more than it
can latent intellectual ability. They come
from the man himself. But education
can give him a mental and moral train
ing which will better qualify him to serve
himself, his family and his community.
A trained intellect is a fine tool by
which Character, the master workman,
can do a better job of life.
An essential of character is high ideals
and vision. And if the university, espe
cially in our cultural courses, does not
give the student higher conceptions and
constructive ideals as to his duties as a
citizen or public official, it is a partial
failure. Out of these ideals is born a
sense of duty and unselfishness. Sel
fishness and a spirit of service are not
bed-fellows and the university must
broaden the sense of social duty. We
have all observed the apparent anomaly
of the crooked political boss who, toward
his family and personal associates, is a
model of unquestioned integrity and un
selfishness, but who would rob the pub
lic out of its bottom dollar. This is due
to the fact that he did not feel the latter
to be really wrong; he could not see far
enough to feel that it violated his code
of morals. And before it can be said
that the university has succeeded in its
full function it must create in its grad
uates a broader and deeper vision of
their place in social life, both as citizens
and public leaders.

We must remember that we have, as
yet, done nothing. So far our lives have
been a period of preparation, and, by all
theories of equity, since society has done
so much more on us than on the average
individual, it has a right to expect cor
respondingly more of us. We are told
that the Chevrolet and Ford cars are
given only a few comparatively lenient
tests before they are put on the market,
while the Packard is given twenty-six
severe tests, and if it does not meet them
it is thrown into the junk heap. There is
expected from us a contribution to so
ciety in proportion to the time and ef
fort put into us. An education accepted
is a debt unpaid. Our course of action
is clearly indicated.
If we do not meet the tests of social
duty the university is a poor social in
vestment. The problems of government
and industry, such as capital and labor,
are vastl ymore numerous and complex
today than they ever were before, and
they are awaiting a solution. If the col
lege trained man cannot contribute to
their settlement in some appreciable de
gree, both as critical and intelligent citi
zens andas public leaders, the university
is a failure.
Remembering that the function of our
universities is the fulfillment of the so
cial purpose of making better citizens,
and also remembering that the greatest
loyalty to one's university lies in a loy
alty to its real purpose and ideals, and
remembering that we have, as yet. bee* 1
only consumers and not producers, and
that more is justly expected of us than of
those without a college education, the
challenge of duty becomes clearly and
â€¢obviously apparent.
D. L. GOODMAN.
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Classmen, Ladies
and Gentlemen:
It is for the last time that we have
assembled as a class of undergraduates*
and, in a sense, for the first time as a
class of alumni. Whatever our hopes
and expectations as to the future may be,
it is with a common feeling of regret that
we leave the place of which we have
come to feel that wc are an essential part.
While we are observing the last honors
of this class as an active part of univer
sity life, we are ushering in a new class
as an addition to Stanford's reserve fund
of alumni support.
But however much I might desire to
increase our sense of duty and loyalty
to our university, a mere exhortation on
my part would be futile to that end. For
a sense of loyalty is not created by mere
words, but by active conduct in the form
of service or sacrifice in behalf of one's
university. A sense of duty to, and a
love for, one's school is not a mere men
tal recognition of the presence of a duty,
but consists primarily in a feeling of
emotion slowly but deeply rooted by a
long association with, and service to,
one's university. Representation of one's
school on the athletic field, or in the
bleachers, or in any other form of ac
tivity, or by a subscription to our en
dowment fund, makes one a more loyal
Stanford supporters, but mere words,
never.
Heretofore we have been recipients of
the benefits of our school, but now we
should become its supporters, not only
in actively aiding it, but also in being
\vorthy of it. A university is judged by
its product; it can be no stronger than
its alumni. A good citizen is the best
alumnus.
The highest fulfillment of one's duty
to his school is in the adoption and ful
fillment of its ideals. The university is
a social institution, maintained at great
expense by the outside world, for a pur
pose. That purpose is to produce better
citizens: men and women who can hold
ideals, have courage to push them "over
the hump," and who have the trained
minds essential to grasp and meet the
difficulties of social organization,
whether political, social, or economic.
The proof of the capacity of an athletic
trainer lies in the records of his men;
the proof of the capacity of the univer
sity as an instrument of social improve
ment lies in the records of its citizens.
The highest duty to one's university lies
in the duties of citizenship.
A true conception of the function and
potentialities of the university is essen
tial to a full effectuation of its useful
ness. It cannot accomplish the insuper
able, though some seem to think it can;
nor is it a failure, as others believe. An
understanding of the purposes and uses
of education would serve to dispel the
surprisingly common and widely vary
ing beliefs of what it will do for the stu
dent. Some think that an education gives
one a first lien mortgage on success,
while others think that it is a millstone
on the neck of a struggling swimmer.
Tt must be remembered that education
does not create, but only develops. Men

us to recognize in him the true gentle
man, irrespective of whether his skin be
red, yellow, or black, irrespective of
whether he be an engine-wiper or a
United States senator, and irrespective
of what his creeds, beliefs or social status
may be. It is this which causes us to,
say that "A man is a man wherever you
find him." This undefinable something
we call character. By character we do
not mean mere honesty, however impor
tant that may be. We mean a composite
of qualities: honor, ambition, courage,
a sense of duty and loyalty, sympathy,
and kindness. It is the possession of
these qualities which causes us to call
a man a true man although he may stand
with his hat on in the presence of ladies,
or eat potatoes with his knife. Charac
ter is the steel and concrete foundation
on which has been erected every great
life edifice of history, and it is the same
foundation upon which is built the life
of every successful citizen. Character
is the driving power behind a man; it is
the balance wheel of his conduct, and
the steering wheel of his actions.
There must first of all be ambition.
A 200-ton locomotive without steam will
not push a feather off the track, and
similarly, a man with a fine training and
great ability, but without ambition, will
be equally impotent. Ability unused is
ability non existent.
But ability used to a wrongful pur
pose is a driverless engine run amuck.
Ability used to a wrongful purpose is
worse than no ability at all. An edu
cated and college trained man without
duty or honor is more dangerous to so
ciety than one without such training. It
is said that there is a greater proportion
of college trained men in prison than of
any other important class of men in the
nation. This does not mean that an edu
cation destroys honor or character, but
simply means that, since university men
have greater opportunities and respon
sibilities .the are open to more tempeta
tions. The university must develop the
sense of duty and honor proportionately
training and capacity.
But ambition and honor are not
enough. We must have the man of ini
tiative, a self-winder, a man who starts
things, and who does not wait till they
start him. Progress comes from the few
to the many. Leadership is always in the
minority and the price of its inconven
ience must be paid. But its reward lies
in the self satisfaction which is a con
sciousness of a duty fulfilled.
And .above all, we want men who will
not stop when knocked down, nor seek
a truce with difficulty. Courage is
necessary to pass the ruts and chuck
holes of life. Courage is the endurance
of character under fire.
The university cannot create these
qualities of character any more than it
can latent intellectual ability. They come
from the man himself. But education
can give him a mental and moral train
ing which will better qualify him to serve
himself, his family and his community.
A trained intellect is a fine tool by
which Character, the master workman,
can do a better job of life.
An essential of character is high ideals
and vision. And if the university, espe
cially in our cultural courses, does not
give the student higher conceptions and
constructive ideals as to his duties as a
citizen or public official, it is a partial
failure. Out of these ideals is born a
sense of duty and unselfishness. Sel
fishness and a spirit of service are not
bed-fellows and the university must
broaden the sense of social duty. We
have all observed the apparent anomaly
of the crooked political boss who, toward
his family and personal associates, is a
model of unquestioned integrity and un
selfishness, but who would rob the pub
lic out of its bottom dollar. This is due
to the fact that he did not feel the latter
to be really wrong; he could not see far
enough to feel that it violated his code
of morals. And before it can be said
that the university has succeeded in its
full function it must create in its grad
uates a broader and deeper vision of
their place in social life, both as citizens
and public leaders.

We must remember that we have, as
yet, done nothing. So far our lives have
been a period of preparation, and, by all
theories of equity, since society has done
so much more on us than on the average
individual, it has a right to expect cor
respondingly more of us. We are told
that the Chevrolet and Ford cars are
given only a few comparatively lenient
tests before they are put on the market,
while the Packard is given twenty-six
severe tests, and if it does not meet them
it is thrown into the junk heap. There is
expected from us a contribution to so
ciety in proportion to the time and ef
fort put into us. An education accepted
is a debt unpaid. Our course of action
is clearly indicated.
If we do not meet the tests of social
duty the university is a poor social in
vestment. The problems of government
and industry, such as capital and labor,
are vastl ymore numerous and complex
today than they ever were before, and
they are awaiting a solution. If the col
lege trained man cannot contribute to
their settlement in some appreciable de
gree, both as critical and intelligent citi
zens andas public leaders, the university
is a failure.
Remembering that the function of our
universities is the fulfillment of the so
cial purpose of making better citizens,
and also remembering that the greatest
loyalty to one's university lies in a loy
alty to its real purpose and ideals, and
remembering that we have, as yet. bee* 1
only consumers and not producers, and
that more is justly expected of us than of
those without a college education, the
challenge of duty becomes clearly and
â€¢obviously apparent.
D. L. GOODMAN.
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Classmen, Ladies
and Gentlemen:
It is for the last time that we have
assembled as a class of undergraduates*
and, in a sense, for the first time as a
class of alumni. Whatever our hopes
and expectations as to the future may be,
it is with a common feeling of regret that
we leave the place of which we have
come to feel that wc are an essential part.
While we are observing the last honors
of this class as an active part of univer
sity life, we are ushering in a new class
as an addition to Stanford's reserve fund
of alumni support.
But however much I might desire to
increase our sense of duty and loyalty
to our university, a mere exhortation on
my part would be futile to that end. For
a sense of loyalty is not created by mere
words, but by active conduct in the form
of service or sacrifice in behalf of one's
university. A sense of duty to, and a
love for, one's school is not a mere men
tal recognition of the presence of a duty,
but consists primarily in a feeling of
emotion slowly but deeply rooted by a
long association with, and service to,
one's university. Representation of one's
school on the athletic field, or in the
bleachers, or in any other form of ac
tivity, or by a subscription to our en
dowment fund, makes one a more loyal
Stanford supporters, but mere words,
never.
Heretofore we have been recipients of
the benefits of our school, but now we
should become its supporters, not only
in actively aiding it, but also in being
\vorthy of it. A university is judged by
its product; it can be no stronger than
its alumni. A good citizen is the best
alumnus.
The highest fulfillment of one's duty
to his school is in the adoption and ful
fillment of its ideals. The university is
a social institution, maintained at great
expense by the outside world, for a pur
pose. That purpose is to produce better
citizens: men and women who can hold
ideals, have courage to push them "over
the hump," and who have the trained
minds essential to grasp and meet the
difficulties of social organization,
whether political, social, or economic.
The proof of the capacity of an athletic
trainer lies in the records of his men;
the proof of the capacity of the univer
sity as an instrument of social improve
ment lies in the records of its citizens.
The highest duty to one's university lies
in the duties of citizenship.
A true conception of the function and
potentialities of the university is essen
tial to a full effectuation of its useful
ness. It cannot accomplish the insuper
able, though some seem to think it can;
nor is it a failure, as others believe. An
understanding of the purposes and uses
of education would serve to dispel the
surprisingly common and widely vary
ing beliefs of what it will do for the stu
dent. Some think that an education gives
one a first lien mortgage on success,
while others think that it is a millstone
on the neck of a struggling swimmer.
Tt must be remembered that education
does not create, but only develops. Men
are born not made. Fools and incom
petents remain such after an education.
A bundle of tin, wire and rubber will
become a Ford whether it is sent through
the Ford or the Packard factory. And
consequently, we have "tin models" run
ning around in our universities just as
we have in the outside world. Those
who believe that an education is an.open
sesame to all that is desirable, and those
who believe that education is a dead
weight, make the same mistake, the for
mer believing that education will make
the man, and the latter believing that it
should do so, and is a failure because
they have observed that it does not.
The university, as other stages of edu
cation, uncovers and develops latent
qualities ,but if those potentialities are
not present the university can do noth
ing for him. The purpose of the univer
sity is to give the student an intellectual
training and to plant in him higher ideals
of social duty and honesty. But some
seem to believe that the primary purpose
of the university is to simply give him
such an intellectual preparation as will
enable him to bette rconipete with others
in attaining his own private ambitions.
They forget that the university must do
something more, that mere intellectual
capacity is not everything. There is that
undefinable something about a man,
which defies analysis, but which causes
us to recognize in him the true gentle
man, irrespective of whether his skin be
red, yellow, or black, irrespective of
whether he be an engine-wiper or a
United States senator, and irrespective
of what his creeds, beliefs or social status
may be. It is this which causes us to,

worse than no ability at all. An edu
cated and college trained man without
duty or honor is more dangerous to so
ciety than one without such training. It
is said that there is a greater proportion
of college trained men in prison than of
any other important class of men in the
nation. This does not mean that an edu
cation destroys honor or character, but
simply means that, since university men
have greater opportunities and respon
sibilities .the are open to more tempeta
tions. The university must develop the
sense of duty and honor proportionately
training and capacity.
But ambition and honor are not
enough. We must have the man of ini
tiative, a self-winder, a man who starts
things, and who does not wait till they
start him. Progress comes from the few
to the many. Leadership is always in the
minority and the price of its inconven
ience must be paid. But its reward lies
in the self satisfaction which is a con
sciousness of a duty fulfilled.
And .above all, we want men who will
not stop when knocked down, nor seek
a truce with difficulty. Courage is
necessary to pass the ruts and chuck
holes of life. Courage is the endurance
of character under fire.
The university cannot create these
qualities of character any more than it
can latent intellectual ability. They come
from the man himself. But education
can give him a mental and moral train
ing which will better qualify him to serve
himself, his family and his community.
A trained intellect is a fine tool by
which Character, the master workman,
can do a better job of life.
An essential of character is high ideals
and vision. And if the university, espe
cially in our cultural courses, does not
give the student higher conceptions and
constructive ideals as to his duties as a
citizen or public official, it is a partial
failure. Out of these ideals is born a
sense of duty and unselfishness. Sel
fishness and a spirit of service are not
bed-fellows and the university must
broaden the sense of social duty. We
have all observed the apparent anomaly
of the crooked political boss who, toward
his family and personal associates, is a
model of unquestioned integrity and un
selfishness, but who would rob the pub
lic out of its bottom dollar. This is due
to the fact that he did not feel the latter
to be really wrong; he could not see far
enough to feel that it violated his code
of morals. And before it can be said
that the university has succeeded in its
full function it must create in its grad
uates a broader and deeper vision of
their place in social life, both as citizens
and public leaders.

We must remember that we have, as
yet, done nothing. So far our lives have
been a period of preparation, and, by all
theories of equity, since society has done
so much more on us than on the average
individual, it has a right to expect cor
respondingly more of us. We are told
that the Chevrolet and Ford cars are
given only a few comparatively lenient
tests before they are put on the market,
while the Packard is given twenty-six
severe tests, and if it does not meet them
it is thrown into the junk heap. There is
expected from us a contribution to so
ciety in proportion to the time and ef
fort put into us. An education accepted
is a debt unpaid. Our course of action
is clearly indicated.
If we do not meet the tests of social
duty the university is a poor social in
vestment. The problems of government
and industry, such as capital and labor,
are vastl ymore numerous and complex
today than they ever were before, and
they are awaiting a solution. If the col
lege trained man cannot contribute to
their settlement in some appreciable de
gree, both as critical and intelligent citi
zens andas public leaders, the university
is a failure.
Remembering that the function of our
universities is the fulfillment of the so
cial purpose of making better citizens,
and also remembering that the greatest
loyalty to one's university lies in a loy
alty to its real purpose and ideals, and
remembering that we have, as yet. bee* 1
only consumers and not producers, and
that more is justly expected of us than of
those without a college education, the
challenge of duty becomes clearly and
â€¢obviously apparent.
D. L. GOODMAN.
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Classmen, Ladies
and Gentlemen:
It is for the last time that we have
assembled as a class of undergraduates*
and, in a sense, for the first time as a
class of alumni. Whatever our hopes
and expectations as to the future may be,
it is with a common feeling of regret that
we leave the place of which we have
come to feel that wc are an essential part.
While we are observing the last honors
of this class as an active part of univer
sity life, we are ushering in a new class
as an addition to Stanford's reserve fund
of alumni support.
But however much I might desire to
increase our sense of duty and loyalty
to our university, a mere exhortation on
my part would be futile to that end. For
a sense of loyalty is not created by mere
words, but by active conduct in the form
of service or sacrifice in behalf of one's
university. A sense of duty to, and a
love for, one's school is not a mere men
tal recognition of the presence of a duty,
but consists primarily in a feeling of
emotion slowly but deeply rooted by a
long association with, and service to,
one's university. Representation of one's
school on the athletic field, or in the
bleachers, or in any other form of ac
tivity, or by a subscription to our en
dowment fund, makes one a more loyal
Stanford supporters, but mere words,
never.
Heretofore we have been recipients of
the benefits of our school, but now we
should become its supporters, not only
in actively aiding it, but also in being
\vorthy of it. A university is judged by
its product; it can be no stronger than
its alumni. A good citizen is the best
alumnus.
The highest fulfillment of one's duty
to his school is in the adoption and ful
fillment of its ideals. The university is
a social institution, maintained at great
expense by the outside world, for a pur
pose. That purpose is to produce better
citizens: men and women who can hold
ideals, have courage to push them "over
the hump," and who have the trained
minds essential to grasp and meet the
difficulties of social organization,
whether political, social, or economic.
The proof of the capacity of an athletic
trainer lies in the records of his men;
the proof of the capacity of the univer
sity as an instrument of social improve
ment lies in the records of its citizens.
The highest duty to one's university lies
in the duties of citizenship.
A true conception of the function and
potentialities of the university is essen
tial to a full effectuation of its useful
ness. It cannot accomplish the insuper
able, though some seem to think it can;
nor is it a failure, as others believe. An
understanding of the purposes and uses
of education would serve to dispel the
surprisingly common and widely vary
ing beliefs of what it will do for the stu
dent. Some think that an education gives
one a first lien mortgage on success,
while others think that it is a millstone
on the neck of a struggling swimmer.
Tt must be remembered that education
does not create, but only develops. Men
are born not made. Fools and incom
petents remain such after an education.
A bundle of tin, wire and rubber will
become a Ford whether it is sent through
the Ford or the Packard factory. And
consequently, we have "tin models" run
ning around in our universities just as
we have in the outside world. Those
who believe that an education is an.open
sesame to all that is desirable, and those
who believe that education is a dead
weight, make the same mistake, the for
mer believing that education will make
the man, and the latter believing that it
should do so, and is a failure because
they have observed that it does not.
The university, as other stages of edu
cation, uncovers and develops latent
qualities ,but if those potentialities are
not present the university can do noth
ing for him. The purpose of the univer
sity is to give the student an intellectual
training and to plant in him higher ideals
of social duty and honesty. But some
seem to believe that the primary purpose
of the university is to simply give him
such an intellectual preparation as will
enable him to bette rconipete with others
in attaining his own private ambitions.
They forget that the university must do
something more, that mere intellectual
capacity is not everything. There is that
undefinable something about a man,
which defies analysis, but which causes
us to recognize in him the true gentle
man, irrespective of whether his skin be
red, yellow, or black, irrespective of
whether he be an engine-wiper or a
United States senator, and irrespective
of what his creeds, beliefs or social status
may be. It is this which causes us to,
say that "A man is a man wherever you
find him." This undefinable something
we call character. By character we do
not mean mere honesty, however impor
tant that may be. We mean a composite
of qualities: honor, ambition, courage,
a sense of duty and loyalty, sympathy,
and kindness. It is the possession of
these qualities which causes us to call
a man a true man although he may stand
with his hat on in the presence of ladies,
or eat potatoes with his knife. Charac
ter is the steel and concrete foundation
on which has been erected every great
life edifice of history, and it is the same
foundation upon which is built the life
of every successful citizen. Character
is the driving power behind a man; it is
the balance wheel of his conduct, and
the steering wheel of his actions.
There must first of all be ambition.
A 200-ton locomotive without steam will
not push a feather off the track, and
similarly, a man with a fine training and
great ability, but without ambition, will
be equally impotent. Ability unused is
ability non existent.
But ability used to a wrongful pur
pose is a driverless engine run amuck.
Ability used to a wrongful purpose is
worse than no ability at all. An edu
cated and college trained man without
duty or honor is more dangerous to so
ciety than one without such training. It
is said that there is a greater proportion
of college trained men in prison than of
any other important class of men in the

simply means that, since university men
