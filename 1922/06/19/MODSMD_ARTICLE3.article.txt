# DAN GOODMAN GIVES[illegible] ORATION AT ANNUAL CLASS DAY SERVICES
## 
### 
Mr. Chairman, Fellow Classmen, Ladies
and Gentlemen:
It is for the last time that we have
assembled as a class of undergraduates*
and, in a sense, for the first time as a
class of alumni. Whatever our hopes
and expectations as to the future may be,
it is with a common feeling of regret that
we leave the place of which we have
come to feel that wc are an essential part.
While we are observing the last honors
of this class as an active part of univer
sity life, we are ushering in a new class
as an addition to Stanford's reserve fund
of alumni support.
But however much I might desire to
increase our sense of duty and loyalty
to our university, a mere exhortation on
my part would be futile to that end. For
a sense of loyalty is not created by mere
words, but by active conduct in the form
of service or sacrifice in behalf of one's
university. A sense of duty to, and a
love for, one's school is not a mere men
tal recognition of the presence of a duty,
but consists primarily in a feeling of
emotion slowly but deeply rooted by a
long association with, and service to,
one's university. Representation of one's
school on the athletic field, or in the
bleachers, or in any other form of ac
tivity, or by a subscription to our en
dowment fund, makes one a more loyal
Stanford supporters, but mere words,
never.
Heretofore we have been recipients of
the benefits of our school, but now we
should become its supporters, not only
in actively aiding it, but also in being
\vorthy of it. A university is judged by
its product; it can be no stronger than
its alumni. A good citizen is the best
alumnus.
The highest fulfillment of one's duty
to his school is in the adoption and ful
fillment of its ideals. The university is
a social institution, maintained at great
expense by the outside world, for a pur
pose. That purpose is to produce better
citizens: men and women who can hold
ideals, have courage to push them "over
the hump," and who have the trained
minds essential to grasp and meet the
difficulties of social organization,
whether political, social, or economic.
The proof of the capacity of an athletic
trainer lies in the records of his men;
the proof of the capacity of the univer
sity as an instrument of social improve
ment lies in the records of its citizens.
The highest duty to one's university lies
in the duties of citizenship.
A true conception of the function and
potentialities of the university is essen
tial to a full effectuation of its useful
ness. It cannot accomplish the insuper
able, though some seem to think it can;
nor is it a failure, as others believe. An
understanding of the purposes and uses
of education would serve to dispel the
surprisingly common and widely vary
ing beliefs of what it will do for the stu
dent. Some think that an education gives
one a first lien mortgage on success,
while others think that it is a millstone
on the neck of a struggling swimmer.
Tt must be remembered that education
does not create, but only develops. Men
are born not made. Fools and incom
petents remain such after an education.
