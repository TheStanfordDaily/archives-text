# EDUCATION MEANS GREATER SERVICE SAYS DR. WILBUR
## "Do Your Part and a Little Bit More" is President's Message to 1922 Graduates

What is human progress? We could
not bear to think of the onward march
of the race if we did not feel
that that march is leading us to higher
and better things. The briefest glance
at our history tells us that we have
widely extended the range of our sen
ses, increased the stores coming from
human memory and enlarged the
sphere and enhanced the comfort of
the individual. While we have added
greatly to the sum of human knowl
edge until a high school boy knows
more than Solon or Aristotle ever
could, we are not sure thereby that
we are more intellectual than were
many of the ancients or that we un
derstand the human heart and human
happiness any more than did they. We
certainly cannot claim a greater ap
preciation of beauty although we can
say for ourselves that cruelty is not
now enthroned as it so often has been
in the past. Justice for all and human
liberty mean more than they ever did
before. The Christian religion has
taught us respect for the individual
body as the tepel of the soul and
given us new values in co-operation,â€”
in the development of a community
mind and in the growth of our percep
tion of duties to each other.
One of the most potent factors in
human life and in education is the
power of tradition and yet all progress
must upset tradition. Those who look
backward go forward slowly. The body
of today cannot be prepared for the
generation ahead solely on the find
ings or beliefs of the generation be
hind. The bringing in of the experi
mental method showing the "why" of
things paralyzes the inhibitions of tra
dition and sets free each generation
and each individual to comey into har
mony with the facts of the world. We
no longer can survive in the ever
deepening currents of human knowl
edge unless we can touch bottom
somewhere. The man in the modern
world who merely mimics the actions
and the thoughts of his father is soon
woefully out of date. It requires an
analysis of the past from the stand
point of the known fundamentals and
constant touch with the new to have a
going program either for a man or a
people. To be permanently settled is
to stagnate. "Licht, mehr Licht," that
cry of Goethe, points the way of all
advance and all education.
You, Stanford's latest product, are
now well started to play your part in
human progress. You have had devel
opment of mind and body, that discip
line that comes from persistent work,
and have been associated with those
of the highest ideals. It is now your
turn to fit into the social order. May
I offer a few simple suggestions.
Give your best impulses a square
(leal.
Don't be afraid to be associated witli
any pood movement.
Distinguish between:
1 lie things that are wrong
ibe tilings that are unwise and
avoid both.
Make your backbone solid bv using
it.
Respect and follow the man who
knows.
Education means a capacity for
greater service, greater usefulness and
tor the happiness that goes with use
fulness, not the training of your mind
so that you can acquire a bigger house
or a finer automobile. It means capa
city for co-operation with your fel
lows in solving the problems we all
face together. It means, too, an ap
preciation of the value of the beauti
ful as well as the immediately useful.
In short, it would mean to you i
man's or a woman's chance to do your
full part AND A LITTLE MORE in
the work of the* world.
