# SENIORS WILL DONATE FOUNTAIN FOR COURT IN FRONT OF UNION
## 
### 
A fountain for the court of the new
Union will be the gift of the seniors to
the University. To complete this al
ready beautiful spot on the campus the
graduating class thought that it would
be particularly fitting to put in a foun
tain of sufficient size so that the running
water may make a good display and at
the base there may be a place for little
children to play in the water.
This fountain will be in the center of
the court where the flower garden now
is placed and will take up the Â»ntire
space now occupied by the flower bed.
The style of the fountain is not settled
as yet, but it will be in keeping with the
general architecture of the buildings at
the side and rear of the court. Probably
the statue work in the center of the
fountain will be very simple and will
carry out the idea of the Spanish model
of the rest of the ground architecture.,
The pond at the base will not be made
deep to keep fish but will be built shal
low so that the children may play there
when allowed around the buildings. This
will make it a great deal easier to clean
also and will help out the maintenance
thereby.
When Comptroller Roth gets back he
will take over the plans for the construc
tion and will settle the final design. The
University is to put in the fountain with
the money help of the Senior Class.
