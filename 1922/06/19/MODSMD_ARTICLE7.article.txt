# AL TAYLOR SPEAKS TO CLASSMATES AT FINAL GATHERING
## 
### 
In opening the Class Day ceremonies
Albert Taylor, President of the Senior
Class, spoke the following words in
appreciation of the part that the Uni
versity has played in the history of
the class:
"Before beginning the ceremonies of
the Class Day it would not be inap
propriate to say a few words of ap
preciation of the opportunities that
we will enjoy in becoming Stanford
graduates. Throughout four of the
most formative years of our lives we
have been privileged to recognize
Stanford as our Alma Mater; we have
formed close friedships through con
stant association that we will cherish
as long as we shall live. Fortunate, in
deed, have we been in coming to Stan
ford for our academic work; here we
have met and have been instructed by
the finest college personnel in the
country. Dr. Wilbur, Mr. Roth, and
other members of the administration
have been ever solicitous as to the
welfare of the class.
"We realize the importance of the
move that we are taking, and the duty
incumbent upon us to so represent the
University as to be everywhere known
as Stanford men and women rather
than merely men and women of Stan
ford. As a class we can show our
appreciation of the advantages gained
while here by lending our loyal sup
port as alumni, and we assure the
Trustees and Faculty that all the mem
bers of the class will do all within
their power to support Stanford in
after years."
Following these introductory words
the Class Oration was delivered by
Daniel Goodman. Anna Ramsey sang
"The Way Home." The Class History
was read by Ross C. Fisher; the Class
Poem by Mollie Windish; David Fa
ville sang "Vale"; and Tom Carskadon
read the Class Will.
