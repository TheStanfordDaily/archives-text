# SENIOR EMDOWMENT SUBSCIPTION NEAR 100 PER CENT MARK
## 
### 
Nearly one hundred per cent is the
record set by the 1922 class in the sub
scriptions to the endowment fund. The
class took this as one of its efforts dur
ing the graduation instead of the straight
insurance that wa sstartcd two years ago.
Then it was the idea to have each class
take out a nominal policy with the Uni
versity as beneficiary and at the end of
twenty years the paid up policies would
become a part of the University endow
ment.
This year when the drive was com
pleted among the students for the first
million contribution the Seniors took it
upon themselves to see that the grad
uating class came through entire and
this they have with but a very few ex
ceptions. In each of these cases there
Jias been an excuse so that the response
has been a real one hundred per cent one
as far as the class effort is concerned.
This is one of the things which the
Senior Class has taken upon itself ancT
has seen successfully carried through to
completion.
