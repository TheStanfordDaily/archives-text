# HISTORY DESCRIBES VARIED ACTIVITIES OF CLASS OF 1922
## 
### 
Were but one word to be used to
describe the history of the 1922 Class,
it would be "Progress"; progress from
an unorganized, heterogeneous class
to a unified group working always for
the betterment of Stanford. Born dur
ing the closing events of the War we
have been privileged to lend our aid
through a university reconstruction
period, and now we graduate with
these things accomplished and with a
bigger and better Stanford on the
horizon. The completion of a neW lib
rary, a stadium, a pavilion, a men's
union; yes, even the putting of skids
to the Stanford Inn, has occurred dur
ing our sojourn. We have witnessed
an athletic slump, a revival, and the
putting of athletics on a sound basis.
A food institute has been brought here,
tuition raised along with scholarship
standing, and an Endowment Drive
started. Hand in hand with this pro
gress of the University has gone the
progress of the Class, and, inversely,
in a measure due to our progress has
come the progress of the university.
It was as prospective soldiers and
not college students that most of our
members came to Stanford in October,
1918. Within a couple of days nearly
six hundred of us were established at
our future home and most of the men
of the class had been inducted in the
Students' Army Training Corps. Soon
we were under rigid military discip
line, trying in our poor way to become
soldiers. All of us had our eye on
officers' training camps, so during the
following two months Stanford was
secondary. Hardly had we been estab
lished on the campus when the "flu"
broke out and we were by government
orders summarily cut off from the out
side world. Flu masks became the
order of the day. The Theta Xi, Phi
Gamma Delta, Delta Tau Delta, and
Alpha Tau Omega houses were turned
into hospitals and those of us who were
not fortunate enough to get the "flu"
spent our time in drill, K. P., and hos
pital duty. During this period out
first sorrow was occasioned when
seven of our classmates were taken
by the flu. They were Kenneth Rus
sell, A. M. Sherrard, G. L. Favinger,
T. J. Clunie, Eloise Loewenson, Wei
ford Wetzel and Raemond Collis.
Jack McDowell, the Dean of Men,
proved a friend to the Class early in
October when he saved a group of our
number from the paddle and a watery
grave at the hands of the blood thirsty
Sophomore army men. In spite of our
handicap by the "flu," we began to
realize that Stanford would be our
home for some time, and we began to
get acquainted. This new spirit evi
denced itself when on October 20th
a few over enthusiastic members of the
Class desecrated the new library roof
with our Class numerals. Sophomore
and upperclassmen alike arose 'n
righteous indignation, and soon repre
sentatives of the Class —many of whom
are here now —were commandeered
and put to work scrubbing off the
paint. While a misguided activity, per
haps, yet the incident showed the be
ginnings of a class spirit.
A few days later we had our first
class meeting in the Assembly Hall.
Jack McDowell was there to see that
violence was not done. All was bed
lam until a towering young Demosthe
nes from Riverside in the person of
Don Hancock, quelled the multitude
by the simple expedient of outshout
ing them. Soon we had C. W. Wherry
elected our first president. Wherry
