# HISTORY DESCRIBES VARIED ACTIVITIES OF CLASS OF 1922
## 
### 
Were but one word to be used to
describe the history of the 1922 Class,
it would be "Progress"; progress from
an unorganized, heterogeneous class
to a unified group working always for
the betterment of Stanford. Born dur
ing the closing events of the War we
have been privileged to lend our aid
through a university reconstruction
period, and now we graduate with
these things accomplished and with a
bigger and better Stanford on the
horizon. The completion of a neW lib
rary, a stadium, a pavilion, a men's
union; yes, even the putting of skids
to the Stanford Inn, has occurred dur
ing our sojourn. We have witnessed
an athletic slump, a revival, and the
putting of athletics on a sound basis.
A food institute has been brought here,
tuition raised along with scholarship
standing, and an Endowment Drive
started. Hand in hand with this pro
gress of the University has gone the
progress of the Class, and, inversely,
in a measure due to our progress has
come the progress of the university.
It was as prospective soldiers and
not college students that most of our
members came to Stanford in October,
1918. Within a couple of days nearly
six hundred of us were established at
our future home and most of the men
of the class had been inducted in the
Students' Army Training Corps. Soon
we were under rigid military discip
line, trying in our poor way to become
soldiers. All of us had our eye on
officers' training camps, so during the
following two months Stanford was
secondary. Hardly had we been estab
lished on the campus when the "flu"
broke out and we were by government
orders summarily cut off from the out
side world. Flu masks became the
order of the day. The Theta Xi, Phi
Gamma Delta, Delta Tau Delta, and
Alpha Tau Omega houses were turned
into hospitals and those of us who were
not fortunate enough to get the "flu"
spent our time in drill, K. P., and hos
pital duty. During this period out
first sorrow was occasioned when
seven of our classmates were taken
by the flu. They were Kenneth Rus
sell, A. M. Sherrard, G. L. Favinger,
T. J. Clunie, Eloise Loewenson, Wei
ford Wetzel and Raemond Collis.
Jack McDowell, the Dean of Men,
proved a friend to the Class early in
October when he saved a group of our
number from the paddle and a watery
grave at the hands of the blood thirsty
Sophomore army men. In spite of our
handicap by the "flu," we began to
realize that Stanford would be our
home for some time, and we began to
get acquainted. This new spirit evi
denced itself when on October 20th
a few over enthusiastic members of the
Class desecrated the new library roof
with our Class numerals. Sophomore
and upperclassmen alike arose 'n
righteous indignation, and soon repre
sentatives of the Class —many of whom
are here now —were commandeered
and put to work scrubbing off the
paint. While a misguided activity, per
haps, yet the incident showed the be
ginnings of a class spirit.
A few days later we had our first
class meeting in the Assembly Hall.
Jack McDowell was there to see that
violence was not done. All was bed
lam until a towering young Demosthe
nes from Riverside in the person of
Don Hancock, quelled the multitude
by the simple expedient of outshout
ing them. Soon we had C. W. Wherry
elected our first president. Wherry
was succeeded by Harold Fendler. One
youthful Lochinvar nominated "the
girl 111 the blue dress" for secretary,
and so attractive was the dress that
she was elected on a white ballot.
The "llu" ban was lifted soon after
and the class began in earnest to take
part 111 Stanford affairs. Then came
the Armistice on Nevomber 11th, per
haps not properly appreciated by those
of us who had to celebrate by a march
to "Pally" at 1:00 in the morning. We
built an expeditional freshman bonfire
and then guarded it so carefully that
California finally abandoned their
motor attack several machines shy,
though two of our members, Hugh
Shamberger and Frank Spurlock, took
an enforced excursion to the California
campus for a couple of days. This
was in revenge of a mysterious chang
ing in color of the Berkeley "C" from
a gold to a deep cardinal. Though the
rally and bonfire was a big success, it
did not cause our S. A. T. C. football
eleven to win from California, lacking
some sixty-seven points.
We may say that our real class his
tory as Stanford students began with
the opening of the next quarter. Many
of those who had been discharged
from the S. A. T. C. did not came back,
and our Class was considerably de
pleted. So marked was this that only
25 per cent of the original Class are
candidates for degrees this quarter.
Half of our Class then has been rec*
ruited from those who registered later
or from transfers from other insti
tutions. Such a condition does not
make a strong and unified Class, and
has been a handicap which we have
had to overcome in the later history
of the Class.
We were soon precipitated into our
first under-class scrap. The condi
tions barred a poster fight, but the

tie-up more than made up for it. While
we did not win the rush we fought so
fiercely as to win the respect of the
upperclassmen and our immediate su
periors for the day. Again in the
spring baseball fight after barricading
ourselves at the old Zete house, we
were finally herded down to the old
football field there to lose to the
Sophomores in a close fight.
Our progress was now rapid. At
1 our Frosh Picnic 011 the shores of
Lagunita, some of us tasted water, but
ouly after several Sophomores had
been nearly drowned. Washington's
Birthday came and ended with a
further depletion in our ranks.
We then wisely gave up parades to
turn to more productive activities and
turned out some strong freshman ath
letic teams which, while they follow
ed the tradition of losing to California,
furnished strong competition for the
Bruin Babes. Harry Austin captain
ed basketball; Bill Hawkes, baseball;
Bill Olmstead, crew; and Bob Shlau
deman, track. Our tennis team re
versed the usual order and defeated
the Bruin racquet wielders due to the
efforts of Jim Da vies, Bill Hawkes,
Phil Neer, and Ford Tussing.
In our Sophomore year we satisfac
torily demonstrated our ability to
handle the incoming class by severely
drowning them on the Theta lawn in
the poster fight and then repeating the
trouncing the next day in the tie-up.
Again in the spring we successfully
subdued the '23 class and won the
baseball fight. This was the year of
the famous 14-10 football game, of
Bob Evans, and of winning the Pacific
Coast Conference in basketball, and,
regrettably, of our first defeat in track
in eight years. Don Hancock and John
Sibley came to the front this year is
our presidents.
With the donning of corduroys al
ready many of our Class had become
prominent and the Class membership
became more stabilized. This year
saw the starting of a stadium, a men's
union, a pavilion, and further raises
in the tuition. Our Junior week was
a success and all who attended our
"When Knighthood Was in Flower"
prom and our opera, "Maid to Order,"
written and directed by our own
classmates, pronounced it so. Harry
Austin, Evelyn Johnston, and Bob
Connolly served as presidents this
year.
The current year has seen the com
pletion of the building program, start
ed when we were Juniors. We have
been privileged to see the California
Stanford game in the Stanford Stadi
um, and the opening of the new bask
etball pavition. We have had a year
of great university activity and re
sultant Class activity in supporting
the University's end. Athletics have
been put on a sound basis and a Uni
versity Endowment Fund started. We
have been the only Class to have a
100 per cent subscription to the En
dowment Drive, and we have given
this present aid to take the place
of the customary senior insurance.
Grant Corby and A1 Taylor in the
presidential chair have given their
efforts towards a strong class organi
zation. This year we mourned the
passing of Dr. Branner, the beloved
President Emeritus of the University,
and the Class extends its sincerest
sympathy to his relatives and friends.
While Stanford's athletic history
during our four years has not been as
good as hoped for, and while our Class
has not had a great number of ath
letes, what we have had have brought
credit to the Class. In football. Bob
Shlaudeman stands out as the headiest
quarterback Stanford has had in the
American game. A1 Taylor also play
ed on the Varsity eleven this year.
In basketball we have had Harry
Austin and Jim Davies, the latter of
whom captained the Varsity this year.
We had three men on the last Varsity
crew. They were Abbv Snow. Doug.
McKinnon and Jack Boucher, cox
swain.
Jim Davies and Phil Neer have been
the greatest pair of tennis players ever
to enter Stanford. Phil captained the
team for two years and was largely
responsible for its being made a major
sport. Neer and Davies invaded the
East last summer and put Stanford on
the map in tennis. Phil won the
National Intercollegiate Singles Cham
pionships and was elected president of
the Association for this year. In the
doubles, Jim and Phil reached the
semi-finals.
In baseball we have been repre
sented by Red Maillot; in track by
Bill Comstock, A1 Carrey, and Orlo
Hayes, the latter of which placed in
the hurdles at the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet this year. Managerial block 'S's'
have been awarded to Ford Tussing,
Roland Kinney and Ernest Wilson,
while Stanford's yell-leader this year
was Bob Connolly.
The Class has been exceptionally
strong in dramatic talent and has done
much in elevating the Stanford stage
to the position it now holds. In Lester
Seib the Class claims the recognized
leader in Stanford dramatics of all

time, both as actor and coach. It was
he who played opposite Eleanor Ander
son in "Never Say Die," our Sopho
more play. Others in the Class who
have been important in dramatics have
been Stoddard Atwood, Tom Carska
don, Paul Claflin, Melba Berry, Mildred
Finley, and Frances Merrill. To Rose-
Mary Drachman goes the credit for
the book of our Junior Opera, "Maid
to Order." She also wrote the page
ant and was co-author of the Opera
this year. Tom Carskadon also claims
credit as a dramatic writer of Tighter
vein by his "Chappie Cherio." Myron
Higby has had a stady place as direct
tor of the music for the operas and'
has written many scores for them.
Our strength in Journalism is shown
by the fact that every undergraduate
publication has had a member of the.
'22 Class for its head. Harry Borba
and Bill Evans piloted the Daily Palo
Alto through this year. The Stanford
Pictorial has been edited and managed
by Harry Borba and Paul Talbert.
Hammer and Coffin with foresight en
trusted the Chaparral to Tom Carska
don, and Archie Binns edited the
Cardinal. In the more strictly literary
endeavors we hear the names of
Archie Binns, Ed Landels, Mollie Win
dish. and Rosemary Drachman. Harold
Fendler, Dan Goodman, and Lawrence
Martin Represented us in intercol
legiate debating and in the Joffre de
bates with California. A '22 man. Ed
Landels, won the Western Intercollegi
ate Public Speaking Contest this
spring.
No Class History would be complete
without mention of women's activities,
and particularly would this be true
of the 1922 Class. Throughout the
four years, the women's athletic teams
havcl led the other classes of the Uni
versity, and yet. the Class has been
equally strong in Dramatics and Jour
nalism. Organized Women were under
the able direction of Mary Mathews
this year. Anna Judge presided over
Pan-Hellenic, and Carey Bailard serv
ed as president of the Women's Ath
letic Association. Three women edi
tors on the Daily Palo Alto have been
taken from the '22 Class. They were
Florence Hocking, Mary Jane Clark,
and Bertha Vaughan. Chappie's pages
have been livened by Janice Dunker's
drawings, and she also acted as art
editor of the 1922 Quad. The presiden
cy of the Y. W. C. A. was held by Mari
on Potter. In athletics, Mariorr
Dwight. Doris Stevenson, Carey Bail
ard, Margaret Carlsmith, Hope Sned
den, Henrietta Hoever, and Margaret
Younglove have represented the school
Members of the '23 Class elected ta
Cap and Gown, women's honorary so
ciety, are Marion Clancy, Carey Bail
ard. Marion Dwight, Mary Jane Clark,
Mary Mathews, Bertha Vaughan, Ja
nice Dunker, Kathryn Donald, Anna
Judge, Ruth Davis, and Melba Berry.
Last, but not least, our Class ha?
furnished more then its share to Phi
Beta Kappa, with a total of twenty
four elected from the Class this spring.
This, in brief, is the history of the
Class of 1922, and yet, to use a trite
phrase, "History Repeats Itself. ,r
Others before us have with just as
much pride extolled the praises of
their class, others to follow us will
do the same. Each class has its ath
letic leaders, each its journalistic
leaders, its students; each lays its
plate in the Inner Quad, and when it
does so is sure that it is Stanford's
greatest class. No class will be re
membered long for what it did in the
way of University activities, but must
live through the accomplishments of
its members as alumni. As '95 is re
membered for a Hoover, and a Field,
'9fi, for a Wilbur, '99, for an Irwin, so
will '22 be remembered for its alumni
that make their mark in after years.
All that we have done here, and it has
been much, is but in preparation for
our alumni years. It rests therefore
as a charge upon us that if we are to
preserve the name of '22 in Stanford
annals, we must make our mark as
alumni, remembering always our
duty, love, and veneration for Stan
ford.
