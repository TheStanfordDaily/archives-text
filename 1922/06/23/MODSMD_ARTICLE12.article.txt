# "DR. WILBUR'S LATEST HONOR"

### 
This reprint from the editorial columns of the New York Herald
speaks for itself:
"There is more than ordinary interest in the selection of Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, president of the Leland Stanford, Jr., University, as the
new head of the American Medical Association. Dr. Wilbur, for one
thing, is a young man to he chosen the leader of one of the most distin
guished scientific bodies in the world. He is 47.
"It is interesting, also, because in his own career President Wilbur has
exemplified new tendencies in the field of medical science. Beginning
as an instructor of physiology at Cooper Medical College in San Francisco
—this institution later became the medical department of Stanford Uni
versity—he came to be occupied increasinly in recent years of his
development with the broad social service of his profession.
"When the United States entered the war Herbert Hoover, knowing
Dr. Wilbur to be a physiologist of the first rank and an expert in food
values, asked him to become chief of the conservation division of the
United States Food Administration, a place in which he acquitted himself
with admirable effectiveness. At the 1920 session of the American Medi
cal Association he was appointed to the Council on Medical Education and
Hospitals, which has been studying the problem of co-ordinating the work
of social agencies with that of the medical profession.
"The function of the physician extends far beyond the primary rela
tion between doctor and patient. In developing the broader usefulness of
the profession large opportunities lie with the American Medical Associa
tion, and that body is to be congratulated for its recognition of Dr. Wil
bur's abilities. He is a competent administrator as well as an able
physician."
