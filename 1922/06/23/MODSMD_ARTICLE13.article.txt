# THE 						FIRST MILLION
## 
### 
The assurance of the first million of the three-million-dollar endow
ment comes as a fitting climax to perhaps the best year Stanford has ever
enjoyed. That it all comes from Stanford people and in so short a
time is in itself a worthy achievement and a record of which to be proud.
No other university can boast a better.
Within a single year Stanford has built and paid for the greatest
stadium in the West; has erected a basketball pavilion which has no peer
west of the Rockies, financed, incidentally, by students and non-athletic
budgets; has constructed a Men's Union that partially solves the housing
and eating problem on the campus; and has launched and partially com
pleted the first University endowment campaign.
And not only have these things been achieved, but foundations have
!>een laid for the greatest housing system in any American University,
valuable additions are planned for the educational plant, and educational
authorities are being constantly added to the faculty.
These are merely the high lights. The smaller things, which in ordi
nary years would denote progress, are lost in the brilliance of greater
accomplishments.
BECAUSE there are so many students on the campus, both grad
uates and undergraduates, who have never been here before, it might not
be taken amiss if they were helped in becoming acquainted with the Stan
ford customs and traditions. It is customary for Stanford men to greet
each other with a "Hello," whether they know one another or not. Al
though there are no terrible penalties attached to the breaking of tradi
tions, at any rate it is pleasant to the Stanford family to see them com
plied with.
Smoking on the Quad is not forbidden by regulation or ordinance,
but it isn't done.
