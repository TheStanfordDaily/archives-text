PHOOLOGRAPH
Uvah Nerve stood stock still. His
stock stood still. He wished his stock
still stood. He had purchased it at
,face value ... on hts face. Uvah
didn't value his face but he over
valued his stock. And when one over
values his stock, one can tell it's all
/wrong on the face of it.
Uvah was stumped. Neglecting to
put postage on a hastily-penned let
ter, he stamped his feet instead, and
rushed away, furiously picking this
teeth with a nearby salad fork.
Hours later, Uvah lay on a lonely
couch, sadly yodelling a plaintive re
frain as he read the bed ticker. Sud
denly he sprang to his feet, put them
on, and hastened forth. Stocks had
risen! Amalgamated Nujoline, with a
hop, skip and jump had cleared the
par at a height of six dollars and
four inches, and was ready for another
ileap. Convicts only were not buying.
They knew it was a cell. Uvah hast
ened with flying feet, among them his
own, to the broker. The broken was

out o* town. Nujoline dropped. So
did Uvah. He was out a fortune.

What are the K. K. K.'s?
They're what moonshine comes from.
Aw'gwan!
Sure thing—they're Kentucky Korn
Kobs —all ears.

There once was a King Keagle,
Who got trailed by a government

He got mired in the mud—•
The plot nipped in the bud;
Now he'll lay off the 'merican eagle.

PHOOLOGRAPH
Uvah Nerve stood stock still. His
stock stood still. He wished his stock
still stood. He had purchased it at
,face value ... on hts face. Uvah
didn't value his face but he over
valued his stock. And when one over
values his stock, one can tell it's all
/wrong on the face of it.
Uvah was stumped. Neglecting to
put postage on a hastily-penned let
ter, he stamped his feet instead, and
rushed away, furiously picking this
teeth with a nearby salad fork.
Hours later, Uvah lay on a lonely
couch, sadly yodelling a plaintive re
frain as he read the bed ticker. Sud
denly he sprang to his feet, put them
on, and hastened forth. Stocks had
risen! Amalgamated Nujoline, with a
hop, skip and jump had cleared the
par at a height of six dollars and
four inches, and was ready for another
ileap. Convicts only were not buying.
They knew it was a cell. Uvah hast
ened with flying feet, among them his
own, to the broker. The broken was

out o* town. Nujoline dropped. So
did Uvah. He was out a fortune.

They're what moonshine comes from.
Aw'gwan!
Sure thing—they're Kentucky Korn

He got mired in the mud—•
The plot nipped in the bud;
Now he'll lay off the 'merican eagle.
