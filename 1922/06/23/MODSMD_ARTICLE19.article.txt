# Presentation of Gift Is Unexpected Item On Commencement Program
## 
### 
An item of the Stanford Commence
ment season that was not included on
the program because it was wholly un
expected, was the presentation to Dex
ter S. Kimball, '96, now Dean of the
Engineering Colleges at Cornell, who
returned to the campus for the Stan
ford commencement season, of a gift,
itself emblematic of Stanford, by the
headquarters staff of the American So
ciety of Mechanical Engineers of which
Dean Kimball is president.
This gift is the two-volume auto
biography of Dr. David Starr Jordan,
"The Days of Man," which is soon
to be issued by the World Publishing
Company of which Caspar W. Hodg
son, who is himself a graduate of
Stanford with the class of '96, is
president. The presentation was made
by Professor Guido Marx of the Stan
ford Mechanical Engineering depart
ment on behalf of the American Socie
ty of Mechanical Engineers. Dr. Jor
dan will autograph the volumes for
Dean Kimball as soon as they are
off the press.
