# SUCCESS OF FIRST MILLION CAMPAIGN ASSURED SAYS ROTH
## Organization of Alumni For Endowment Soliciting In East Is Complete 
### 
Unless Stanford alumni in the East
tail to respond like the Californians, the
first million is now practically assured,
according to Comptroller A. E. Roth,
who has just returned from a three
weeks' trip through the country, accom
panied by Lyman E. Pierce, in the inter
ests of the endowment fund.
"So far as organization of alumni clubs
for the purpose of soliciting is concerned,
the campaign is practically concluded and
is three months ahead of schedule," said
Mr. Roth this morning. "The alumni
everywhere were ready to organize by
j the regular plan immediately upon our
arrival." The alumni attitude toward
the campaign, said the Comptroller, was
favorable largely because of the initial
action of students.
Roth and Pierce attended meetings of
the Stanford Alumni Clubs of Phoenix,
St. Louis, Kansas City, New Â«York,
Washington, Chicago, Denver and Salt
Lake. Although organization in every
instance was prompt and efficient, no re
ports are available except on the New
York Club, which showed an advance
list of contributions amounting to $15,(XX)
the first meeting and had $42,000 by the
second meeting, with a certainty of $50,-
000. The first twenty-five pledges to-j
taled $25,000.
Herbert Hoover, Secretary of Com
merce, spoke at the meeting in Washing
ton. as did Dr. William Gutli, president
of Goucher College and a Stanford grad
uate of 1892, and Smith, formerly
a campus editor. YW. Vernon Kellogg
attended the meeting but did not speak.
At the meeting of the New York Club,
numbering almost 400 members, of which
Jackson E. Reynolds, president of the
First National Bank of New York, is
president, the speakers were Reynolds,
Dr. T. A. Storey, Dr. William Snow,
president of the Stanford Alumni Asso
ciation, Brodie Higley, Gene Thayer,
William Erb, and Archie Rice.
Incomplete reports of subscriptions
from the clubs visited by Roth and Pierce
will be received by the endowment com
mittee early next week, at which time
a close estimate of the total subscrip
tions will probably be available.
