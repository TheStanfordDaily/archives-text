# WAR LIBRARY GETS VALUABLE RECORDS
## 
### 
The Hoover War Library at Stan
ford University has acquired a collec
tion of Russian books and documents
regarded as the most important that
has come out of that country since
the war and especially valuable for
the material it contains for the study
of Bolshevism. Professors E. D.
Adams and Ralph H. Lutz, directors
of the Hoover War Library have re
ceived word that the shipment, com
prising fifty-seven cases, has reached
New York on the steamer Esthonia
and will be forwarded to the Universi
ty at once.
The material was sent out of Rus
sia by permission of the Soviet gov
ernment and contains documents,
pamphlets, Bolshevist propaganda,
books, newspapers, proclamations and
posters, gathered by Professor Frank
A. Golder of Stanford, in months of
travel through Russia. It covers all
important phases of Russian history
from 1914 to date, including the first
revolution, the overthrow of the Ke
rensky government, and the counter
revolution.
Dr. Golder, professor of history at
Stanford, is special representative of
the Hoover War Library in Europe.
During the war he carried on import
ant research work for the U. S. Gov
ernment. He is especially familiar
with Russian history, having traveled
and studied there in former years. He
entered the country in search of ma
terial for the Hoover War Library at
the first moment that such entry was
possible after the war.
With the material on Bolshevism
already possessed by Stanford, the two
form the greatest archive for /the
study of that subject in existence out
side Russia itself. It will require
months to unpack the cases and to
classify the material, but it will be
made available for research workers in
the fields it covers at the earliest pos
sible moment.
On the same steamer with the Stan
ford shipment were forty-five cases
of Russian literature for the library of
Harvard University. The Harvard ma
terial is more general, however, being
chiefly volumes of historical works
dealing with events previous to the
war.
The Library has also received the
complete files of the London office
of the Commission of Relief In Bel
gium, which was the executive center
for the C. R. B. work. Sixty-one cases
were received in all, and accompanying
these were four cases of similar ma
terial from Poland.
These archives deal with the dip
lomatic negotiations of the C. R. B.
with the belligerent powers and give
a detailed account of all the phases
of the work of this committee. It
will be necessary to have this ma
terial set up by the expert sent here for
that purpose by the Commission, but
it is expected that it will soon be
available for study by graduate stu
dents and research professors inter
ested in this field.
Much of the material is of a con
fidential nature, since it includes dip
lomatic correspondence with the great
powers, but it will be open to examin
ation by scholars.
