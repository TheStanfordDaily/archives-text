## 
### 
Lewis M. Terman. Professor of Edu
cational Psychology at Stanford Uni
versity, has been appointed executive
head of the Department of Psychology,
the appointment to take effect at once.
He will succeed Professor Frank M.
Angell, who has been head of the psy
chology department since 1892, and
who is now retiring, according to Uni
versity provisions, at the age of 65.
Professor Terman has been at Stan
ford University since 1910. He took
his A. B. degree at Indiana in 1902,
his M. A. at the same place in 1903,
and his Ph. D. in psychology, at Clark
University, in 1905. After he received
his doctor's degree, he was appointed
principal of the San Bernardino High
School, in which position he made
.some investigations in the fields of
child psychology and hygiene. He
published several articles on teachers'
health and health work in the schools.
From this he branched over into stu
dies of genius and stupidity, and the
intelligence of Bchool children. His
book, "The Intelligence of School Chil

dren," was written in 1919.
Since he has been at Stanford, he
has perfected the Stanford-Binet In
telligence Test. This test has been
translated into many different langu
ages and is now in all parts of the
world.
His studies, for the past twelve or
fourteen years, have been along the
lines of measuring intelligence, and
perfecting intelligence and education
al tests. During the war, he was a
major in the division of psychology,
Surgeon General's office, Washington,
D. C., at which time he was co-author
of the National Intelligence Test.
After his return to Stanford, he com
piled the Terman Group Test of In
telligence which is now in use in the
greater part of the high schools, and
in some of the colleges in this coun
try.
This past year. Professor Terman
has been making a study of gifted
children. He was awarded a grant
of $20,300 by the Commonwealth Fund
of NeW York City, for this study. Pro
fessor Terman is one of the leading
psychologists in America, and his ap
pointment as executive head of the
psychology department at Stanford is
important as it allies the fields of
applied and experimental phychology
which, in the past, have been kept so
distinctly apart.
Dr. Terman's appointment is not
the only development in the work in
psychology at Stanford. Two addi
tional men have been secured. One
of these, Dr. W. R. Miles, now psy
chologist at the Nutrition Laboratory
of the Carnegie Institution, is to have
charge of experimental and systematic
psychology. Dr. Miles will probably
conduct many experiments on the in
fluence of nutrition upon mental con
ditions. Dr. Calvin P. Stone, at pres
ent instructor in psychology and neu
rology at the University of Minnesota,
will conduct courses on mental hygi
ene and animal behavior. His fiel-l
is the border line between medicine
and psychology. He has had consider
able training in physiological chem
istry, and is greatly interested in the
influence of the ductless glands on
mental development.
Besides the new men, the psychol
ogy department will still have Dr.
John E. Coover who has been at Stan
ford since 1910. He will continue his
work along the lines of psycho-physics
and psychic research.
The other two members of the de
partment for next year will be Miss
Gertrude M. Trace, who has been
teaching qualitative psychology and
social psychology at Stanford since
1917, and Miss Maud A. Merrill, who
came to Stanford in 1920 and has been
teaching abnormal psychology and
Binet teaching.

al tests. During the war, he was a
major in the division of psychology,
Surgeon General's office, Washington,
D. C., at which time he was co-author
of the National Intelligence Test.
After his return to Stanford, he com
piled the Terman Group Test of In
telligence which is now in use in the
greater part of the high schools, and
in some of the colleges in this coun
try.
This past year. Professor Terman
has been making a study of gifted
children. He was awarded a grant
of $20,300 by the Commonwealth Fund
of NeW York City, for this study. Pro
fessor Terman is one of the leading
psychologists in America, and his ap
pointment as executive head of the
psychology department at Stanford is
important as it allies the fields of
applied and experimental phychology
which, in the past, have been kept so
distinctly apart.
Dr. Terman's appointment is not
the only development in the work in
psychology at Stanford. Two addi
tional men have been secured. One
of these, Dr. W. R. Miles, now psy
chologist at the Nutrition Laboratory
of the Carnegie Institution, is to have
charge of experimental and systematic
psychology. Dr. Miles will probably
conduct many experiments on the in
fluence of nutrition upon mental con
ditions. Dr. Calvin P. Stone, at pres
ent instructor in psychology and neu
rology at the University of Minnesota,
will conduct courses on mental hygi
ene and animal behavior. His fiel-l
is the border line between medicine
and psychology. He has had consider
able training in physiological chem
istry, and is greatly interested in the
influence of the ductless glands on
mental development.
Besides the new men, the psychol
ogy department will still have Dr.
John E. Coover who has been at Stan
ford since 1910. He will continue his
work along the lines of psycho-physics
and psychic research.
The other two members of the de
partment for next year will be Miss
Gertrude M. Trace, who has been
teaching qualitative psychology and
social psychology at Stanford since
1917, and Miss Maud A. Merrill, who
came to Stanford in 1920 and has been
teaching abnormal psychology and
Binet teaching.
Lewis M. Terman. Professor of Edu
cational Psychology at Stanford Uni
versity, has been appointed executive
head of the Department of Psychology,
the appointment to take effect at once.
He will succeed Professor Frank M.
Angell, who has been head of the psy
chology department since 1892, and
who is now retiring, according to Uni
versity provisions, at the age of 65.
Professor Terman has been at Stan
ford University since 1910. He took
his A. B. degree at Indiana in 1902,
his M. A. at the same place in 1903,
and his Ph. D. in psychology, at Clark
University, in 1905. After he received
his doctor's degree, he was appointed
principal of the San Bernardino High
School, in which position he made
.some investigations in the fields of
child psychology and hygiene. He
published several articles on teachers'
health and health work in the schools.
From this he branched over into stu
dies of genius and stupidity, and the
intelligence of Bchool children. His
book, "The Intelligence of School Chil

dren," was written in 1919.
Since he has been at Stanford, he
has perfected the Stanford-Binet In
telligence Test. This test has been
translated into many different langu
ages and is now in all parts of the
world.
His studies, for the past twelve or
fourteen years, have been along the
lines of measuring intelligence, and
perfecting intelligence and education
