# WILLIAM H. BARROW APPOINTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION DIRECTOR
## Harvard Man Will Take Charge Of Encina Gymnasium; Is Now Medical Officer Of Boys School At Concord 
### 
William Hulbert Barrow, M.D., has been appointed Director of the De
partment of Physical Education for Men to take the place of Dr. A. D. Browne
who has resigned to take up other work, according to information released
by President Wilbur's office this afternoon. The new medical adviser for men
will begin his duties at Stanford probably shortly after mid-summer.
Dr. Barrows is a graduate of Harvard and received his M.D. there in 1916.
He was soon thereafter appointed house officer on medical service in the
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital of Boston. Immediately after the outbreak of
the war, he became a member of the Medical Corps of the regular army, in
which service he spent three and a half years with rank of major.

While overseas, Dr. Barrows serve:!
in executive positions and as sanitary
inspector of two large military camps,
/and spent several months on the front
as regimental and battalion surgeon.
On his return to the United States
he acted as Assistant Chief and Chief
of Medical Service in general hospi
tals in Baltimore and Washington.
He is now Medical Supervisor at
.Middlesex School, Concord, Mass., a
large private educational plant for
boys. Dr. Barrow has been engaged
in this work for one year. He is in
general charge of the health of stu
dents, and their physical activities, and
superintends the dispensary and hos
pital.
The attention of the University
authorities was first brought to Stan
ford's new director of Encina Gymna
sium by his attitude towards physical
education and toward all athletics in
general. Since he, himself, was an
athlete of the less able type in eolloge,
Dr. Barrows has always made it a
point to help out the "dub" in ath
letics as much as possible, according
to those who were instrumental in se
curing his services for Stanford. In
accordance with the University po
licy to build up as great a number
of men physically as possible, he is
expected to make intramural athletics
one of the most extensive of college
activitiesâ€”a system whereby all may
get the training, and the best may com
pete on intercollegiate teams.
