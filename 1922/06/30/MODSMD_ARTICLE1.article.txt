# LECTURER DECLARES CONTROL OF PACIFIC ISLANDS IMPORTANT
## Destiny of Europe in Hands of Strongest Nation Says Professor Williams 
### 
"The nation that controls the Pacific
islands controls the destiny of European
countries." In these words Professor
Edward T. Williams of the University of
California expressed the significance of
the islands of the Pacific in his lecture
Tuesday evening on "National Rivalry
in the Pacific Islands."
Spain was the first European country
to acquire territory in the Pacific islands,
and Spain was soon followed by France.
In 1820 the United States sent the first
missionaries to Hawaii and by 1854,
when those islands were offered to the
United States, they were almost Chris
tianized. When Germany acquired the
Marshall Islands, Great Britain awoke
Pacific, and entered the rivalry. In 1889
to the importance of the islands of the
the Samoan group was divided among
Great Britain, Germany, and the United
States. During the Spanish War, the
United States obtained the islands of
Hawaii, Guam, and purchased the Philip
pines for $20,000,000. It was not until
the beginning of the twentieth century
that Japan became anxious to fasten a
hold on some of the islands in the Pa
cific. Political intrigue then centered
about the islancjs north of the equator
which were especially coveted by the
Japanese. Professor Williams thinks
that Korea's lamentable experience under
Japanese control gives us sufficient cause
to worry about Japan's mandatory of the
island of Yap, where the United States
has established missionary schools.
In Williams' opinion, the five-power
naval treaty which provides that the in
sular possessions of the nations be not
fortified is the best thing possible, assur
ing as it does a ten-year vacation from
war. The four-power pact of Great
Britain, Japan, France, and the United
States does not permit the use of force
in the carrying out of its terms, and the
long discussion in the senate was un
necessary, according to Williams. He
spoke briefly of the Washington confer
ence which was called for two simple
reasons, to limit armaments and to settle
certain questions of the Far East. The
time has not yet come, thinks Williams,
when the nations of the world can do
away entirely with armaments and wars.
