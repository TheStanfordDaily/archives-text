# REDWOOD RABBITS
## 
### 
One "Rabbit" Bradshaw was
enough to scare the life out of
a dozen football teams the last
two grid seasons, and now that
he has become coach of the
Redwood High eleven, all the
prep school teams in the state
are beginning to oil up their
bunny guns. If one rabbit can
put an unholy fear into a team,
eleven proteges of the same hare
ought to be able to reverse the
action of the hare and hounds
chase. Perhaps the Peninsular
Athletic League will wish it had
not spent its money on a game
license for this fall, when it ob
serves the hunted rabbit doing
his stuff in the shape of eleven
young ones.
But maybe the bunnies won't
be so pugnacious as the Nevada
hare, in which case Berkeley
won't have to bemoan the loss of
their chief huntsman, E. P. Hunt,
much anyway.
