# NEER AND DAVIES LOSE IN EASTERN NET TOURNAMENT
## Stanford Man Forced to Give Up Title in Semi-Final Round of Singles 
### 
Fhil Neer, American intercollegiate
singles champion and twice captain of
the Stanford tennis varsity, lost his
match of the semi-finals to L. E. Wil
liams of \ ale yesterday in the national
tournament of the Merion Cricket Club,
at Haverford, Pa. With the match Neer
loses his ranking as "No. 1" player among
college stars of the country.
In the previous round Jimmie Davies
lost a hard match to Wray Brown of
Washington University, St. Louis. Da
vies enjoyed fourth place on the ranking
list. The match between Brown and
Davies was probably the best of the
tournament to date. The players di
vided the first two sets with 6-1 scores,
and in the third Davies, who had a 4-3
lead, was unable to cope with the St.
Louis star, who gathered in the next
three games.
Neer and Davies last summer spent
three months touring the East, when they
met the strongest players in that section
without defeat. Neer then played
through the Merion tournament without
defeat, which entitled him to the ranking
of American champion.
This year the two, together with Cap
tain-elect Richard Hinckley, hurried to
Haverford just after final examinations.
Neer and Davies will continue to play in
the East during the summer, entering all
the better known tournaments.
Both Neer and Davies are enjoying
their last season as Stanford court rep
resentatives, as both become ineligible
with their third year in college tennis.
