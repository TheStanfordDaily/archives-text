STUDENT LIFE IN ISUMMER
Summer quarters may be deadening, stiffling, stagnant affairs to
students who know the activity of the normal Stanford year. Summer
quarters are different. No two present the same type of student body,
nor the same problems for student administration, if there is any student
administration, and it is therefore difficult to prepare a plan or scheme to
take care of summer student affairs, as no one knows what line of problem
is likely to develop.
Last summer an unexpected number of freshmen enrolled, along with
a group of sophomores, and an unprecedented problem in discipline grew
up before the older men realized its presence. They then straightened
out this problem, and endeavored thereafter to carry on with the new
freshmen a small plan of education in the ways of Stanford that would
give them a little start for the fall quarter.
Last summer saw also the first practicing of the Stanford honor sys
tem by which students take their own examinations, with their own esti
mate of their own honor to guide them in proper conduct. In establishing
this system the Student Council found a considerable problem for itself.
Just what the serious problems of the current quarter may be, we do
not know at present, but certainly there is room for a student assembly
that will provide a better opportunity for visiting students to learn some
thing more of Stanford ways than they can gain from reading and
inference. The retiring and incoming student body president are both on
the campus, and either, we presume, is capable of conducting an assembly
of value. The working of the honor system in particular, and certain
necessary customs, should be placed before the enrolled students.
Furthermore, among the most enjoyable hours of the last summer
quarter, we are told, were spent by transient students at the two assemblies
conducted during that period.
