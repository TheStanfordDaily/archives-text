Stanford is fortunate this summer in having secured the services of
faculty members from universities and colleges all over the country â€”men
and women who are nationally known in their respective fields, and who
will not only impart something of value to Stanford students, but will go
away better for the experience themselves.
Stanford likes to have visiting instructors and professors take an
active interest in the University itself and to take a part in all such
activities as are afforded during their stay here. It does more to build
up a feeling of good and cooperation and to make the various educa
tional centers better acquainted with one another than any other single
influence along academic lines. It permits an interchange of ideas and
customs and serves in the end to broaden and to add vitality to educa
tional fields. It is a part of the purpose of this system of summer educa
tion to make the benefits mutual.' Otherwise it is a much less worthy
proposition.
