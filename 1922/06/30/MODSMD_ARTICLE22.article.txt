### 
"One hundred per cent subscription to
tlie endowment fund," was the slogan
adopted by the class of 1920 at its re
union last Saturday when a permanent
committee was appointed to canvass the
members of the class who have not yet
subscribed to the first million for Stan
ford. "Red" Tauzer, Paul H. Clyde,
and Mary T. Thomas were chosen for
the permanent class committee. Art
Harzfeld was chairman of the reunion
committee. Dr. Wilbur made a short
talk to the class.
