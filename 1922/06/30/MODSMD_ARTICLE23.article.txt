# VALUABLE NEW BOOKS HAVE BEEN ADDED TO LIBRARY COLLECTION
## 
### 
Among a collection of very interest
ing new books which have been re
cently placed on the shelves of the
loading room of the library, is a vo
lume entitled "Europe Since 1870," by
Edward Raymond Turner, who is an
authority on westward expansion. Mr.
Turner gives Â£ general history of Eu
rope, taking in conditions before, dur
ing and after the war.
A book on "The Vitamines," a food
substance, compiled by H. C. Sherman,
professor of Food Chemistry at the
University of Columbia, and, S. L.
Smith, specialist in Biological and
Food Chemistry in the United States
Department of Agriculture, gives a
scientific treatise of various food
chemicals and substances. The work
is a result of the combined efforts of
the National Research Council and
of various other organizations inter
ested in that line of work in America.
"On Life and Letters" by Atiatole
France, a translation by D. B. Stewart,
is of very general interest among the
books of current fiction, because it
touches upon the lives of so many of
the author's contemporaries, besides
giving a vivid and detailed account of
liis own life. It is typical of the
author's simple style, and is full of
amusing incidents.
One of the most distinctive, perhaps
of the entire collection is a book of
"Negro Folk Rhymes" by Thomas W.
Tally of Fisk University. "It is not
so much the beauty of the poetry, as
that it shows the artistic impulses
of the negro in spite of his slavery"
is the statement made in the introduc
tion. This thought is characteristic
of all the poems, which have a simple,
often chanting, melody. They reveal
the ambitions of the negroes, thwarted
by the long period of oppression.
