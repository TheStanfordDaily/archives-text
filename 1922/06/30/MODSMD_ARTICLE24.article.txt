# Law Students Form New Eating Club at Union
## 
### 
Following the Harvard system of in
discriminately mixing law and "chow,"
advanced law majors at Stanford have
organized an eating club in the new
Union. T. L. Murphy is president of the
new club, which aims to promote legal
discussions. Membership is limited to
students in the law department who are
working for their J. D. degrees.
