# Sudden Will Furnish Paddock Competition In South Next Week
## 
### 
Eddie Sudden, Stanford's star sprinter,
will furnish most of the competition for
Charlie Paddock, when the latter at
tempts to lower the world's record in the
100-yard dash at the Santa Barbara fes
tivities on July 4.
Paddock is working in connection with
Bob Weaver of the A. A. U. and with
the Santa Barbara officials to make the
track on which he is to run, one of the
fastest in the country. Besides Sudden,
there will be competition furnished by
such speed burners as Crow of Santa
Barbara, Smith of San Fernando and
"Cliff" Argue of Occidental College.
Paddock hopes to establish a new record
of 9 2-5 seconds in the 100-yard dash.
Close followers of athletics doubt very
much whether this can be done, but as
Paddock has run the 220-yard dash two
fifths of a second faster than any other
human, there is a possibility of his lower
ing the record in the shorter sprint.
According to Paddock, Sudden should
be rated as the third fastest man in the
United States by virtue of his placing
fourth in the 100-yard and second in the
220-yard dashes at the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet at Cambridge this year.
