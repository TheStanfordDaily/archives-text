# NAVY CREW BREAKS THREE-MILE RECORD IN REGATTA VICTORY
## 
### 
Washington's oarsmen were nosed out
of first place in the 1922 intercollegiate
regatta at Pougbkeepsie by the brilliant
Navy crew, which broke the three- mile
record in the time of 13 minutes, 33 3-5
seconds. The old record of 14:07 min
utes was made last year by the Annapolis
team with practically the same men.
Third and fourth places were won by
Syracuse and Cornell, respectively.
Most critics of the sport had conceded
the victory to the Navy, with a possible
reservation that Cornell or Syracuse
might eclipse the favorite. Washington,
the only reperesentative of the West, was
looked upon as a dark horse because of
past showings of western oarsmen. This
marks the third time in recent years that
a western crew has upset the dope. Sev
eral years ago, Stanford surprised the
East by placing second to Cornell with
only a scant foot separating them. Last
year California made second place.
Twice during the race, the Navy was
behind, Cornell leading at the mile mark
for a short time, and Washington in ad
vance toward the finish. When the hulls
passed over the finish line the Navy led
by a full length, with Washington ahead
of Syracuse by three-fourths of a length.
