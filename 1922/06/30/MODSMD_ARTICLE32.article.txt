# Big Radio Broadcaster Will Spread Cougar News

Prices and estimates on equipment
for the 500 watt radio broadcaster to
be installed on the campus of the
State College of Washington have been
secured by Dean H. V. Carpenter of
the college of engineering, and the in
stallation is expected to be complete,
ready for operation when the fall term
opens September 18.
Appropriations amounting to $1200
from the Associated Students, the
Alumni Association, and the college
are to be supplemented
by $800 voted by the Pullman Commer
cial Club, now being raised by sub
scription.
Some of the equipment will be order
ed at once, and the rest as fast as the
fund is completed. Dean Carpenter
will install it, assisted by Homer J.
Dana, special experimental engineer
of the college, iand Harold Vance,
laboratory' assistant in physics and
president of the All-Engineers' Club.
Since there are more than 20,000
receiving sets in the state, it will be
possible to reach a large audience
with the Glee Club concerts, lectures,
and news service. Pullman alone has

50 amateur receiving stations now in
operation, and with the broadcaster
at work it is believed many more in
stallations will be made.
"The great demand for radio equip
ment may delay shipment of some of
our material," said Mr. Yance, "but
we hope to be able to get it all by fall.
W. H. Irish, radio head of the Duerr-
Mitchell Electric Co., believes this
is no fad, but is passing its experi
mental stage, and will shortly by an
invaluable thing, just as the telephone
ana telegraph proved to be in their
day."
