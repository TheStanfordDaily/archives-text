# Moulton Has Trouble Securing Track Cinders
## 
### 
Nearly half of the new oval in the
Stanford stadium has been completed
from the foundation to cinders, veteran
trainer and builder Dad Moulton stated
today, and but for the inability to secure
cinders of the proper type the new track
might be finished in the near future.
Moulton has received sample cinders
from all parts of the United States, and
as yet is not satified that any are of the
quality necessary for the fastest speed
way. He now is waiting for samples
from Vancouver which may fill the bill.
Formerly, Moulton said, it was easy to
get cinders of the proper grade from
steamships, hut since the use of oil has
become so popular with ocean-going
craft this source has failed.
