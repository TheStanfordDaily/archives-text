# Board Athletic Control Will Build $450,000 Structure From Profits
## 
### 
USING gate receipts from games in the new stadium as a
basis of payment, the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol begins construction immediately of a $450,000
men's dormitory, in accordance with a recently adopted
policy to devote a certain percentage of income from athletics
to the support of some other University project. Final ar
rangements were completed today in an agreement between
the Board and the Trustees of the University.
For what is probably the first time in the history of American college
athletics, development on a huge scale of a non-athletic project will be
financed by profits from the use of the stadium which was heretofore re
garded as a source of income for athletics only. The great earning power of
the stadium, together with the economy effected in its construction, has al
ready practically cleared up the structure's debts, and has thus early placed
it in a position to be made a factor in the increase of the Stanford endowment.
The unexpected decision of the Board of Athletic Control materially ad
vances the building program of, the University.
The new dormitory will be paid for on a long-time basis. The first pay
ment will be made with the $40,000 which accrues to the Advisory Board of the
Stanford Alumni Association, after having been temporarily applied to the
stadium, by agreement with the original contributors.

Construction of the new housing
unit, which is identical in plan with
the dormitory to be built by the Uni
versity itself, will probably be finished
simultaneously with the building first
planned. Both units are a part of
the University housing system which
will eventually include several more
such dormitories to be built within the
next few years the second million of
the endowment to build the third unit
as soon as the money is raised.
These buildings combine all the best
features of housing accommodations
furnished by colleges and universities
all over the country, having been da>
signed after a thorough study had
been made of systems everywhere by
the architects, by President Ray Ly
man Wilbur, and by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
Each of the new units will house
four living groups of thirty each, to
talling 120 men to each unit. The
buildings are planned so as to give
each group one of the four wings of
the dormitory with a living room for
each group and a large clubroom for
all four. In addition to this, one din
ing room is provided for each group,
all four of which will be served by a
common kitchen.
Each wing of the new buildings will
be comprised of fifteen or more two
room suites, which will quarter two
men each. One room in every suite
will be equipped with French windows
so that the best sleeping arrangements
