# Board Athletic Control Will Build $450,000 Structure From Profits
## 
### 
USING gate receipts from games in the new stadium as a
basis of payment, the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol begins construction immediately of a $450,000
men's dormitory, in accordance with a recently adopted
policy to devote a certain percentage of income from athletics
to the support of some other University project. Final ar
rangements were completed today in an agreement between
the Board and the Trustees of the University.
For what is probably the first time in the history of American college
athletics, development on a huge scale of a non-athletic project will be
financed by profits from the use of the stadium which was heretofore re
garded as a source of income for athletics only. The great earning power of
the stadium, together with the economy effected in its construction, has al
ready practically cleared up the structure's debts, and has thus early placed
it in a position to be made a factor in the increase of the Stanford endowment.
The unexpected decision of the Board of Athletic Control materially ad
vances the building program of, the University.
The new dormitory will be paid for on a long-time basis. The first pay
ment will be made with the $40,000 which accrues to the Advisory Board of the
Stanford Alumni Association, after having been temporarily applied to the
stadium, by agreement with the original contributors.

Construction of the new housing
unit, which is identical in plan with
the dormitory to be built by the Uni
versity itself, will probably be finished
simultaneously with the building first
planned. Both units are a part of
the University housing system which
will eventually include several more
such dormitories to be built within the
next few years the second million of
the endowment to build the third unit
as soon as the money is raised.
These buildings combine all the best
features of housing accommodations
furnished by colleges and universities
all over the country, having been da>
signed after a thorough study had
been made of systems everywhere by
the architects, by President Ray Ly
man Wilbur, and by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
Each of the new units will house
four living groups of thirty each, to
talling 120 men to each unit. The
buildings are planned so as to give
each group one of the four wings of
the dormitory with a living room for
each group and a large clubroom for
all four. In addition to this, one din
ing room is provided for each group,
all four of which will be served by a
common kitchen.
Each wing of the new buildings will
be comprised of fifteen or more two
room suites, which will quarter two
men each. One room in every suite
will be equipped with French windows
so that the best sleeping arrangements
will be provided without being inter
fered with by activities in the other
room —the study. Plenty of light, air,
and running hot and cold water, not
to mention drinking fountains, steam
heat, and rooms for group meetings,
are among the advantages to be offer
ed by these buildings. On the second
floor, above the main club hall there
will be a group of fifteen or more guest
rooms.
The unit to be constructed by the
University itself will be located across
the road which runs north and south
past the east side of Encina Hall, and
will be opposite the Library. When
the housing program is complete, the
first dormitory will be the key build
ing to a quadrangle of living groups
directly east of the educational build
ing. By that time it is expected that
the area now partly occupied by the
Library and Art Gallery will contain
other educational buildings. The next
area to the east, now occupied on the
north by Encina Hall, will probably
be kept as a park for several years.
The dormitory to be finished by the
stadium's income will be across the
road at the east of Encina and will
form the north sidd of the first living
group quadrangle. This will necessi
tate the continuation to Mayfield of
present road running in front of the
quadrangle between Sequoia and En
cina halls. The existing road between
Mayfield and the campus, running
diagonally to the square of the Quad,
back of Encina Hall, will be done
away with next autumn. The south
side of the living group quadrangle
will be formed by the third dormitory
before mentioned.
As in the case of the New Stanford
Union, .the dormitories are all to be
constructed of re-inforced concrete and
will have red-tiled roofs. Buff sand
stone, similar to that used in the
Quad buildings, will be fitted in for
ornamental effects.
The ground for the first building has
already been marked off in readiness
for excavation. Since the architects'
plans are practically complete, it is
hoped that work will begin at once.
It is "planned to have both buildings
finished during the coming academic
year.

Union, .the dormitories are all to be
constructed of re-inforced concrete and
will have red-tiled roofs. Buff sand
stone, similar to that used in the
Quad buildings, will be fitted in for
ornamental effects.
The ground for the first building has
already been marked off in readiness
for excavation. Since the architects'
plans are practically complete, it is
hoped that work will begin at once.
It is "planned to have both buildings

USING gate receipts from games in the new stadium as a
basis of payment, the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol begins construction immediately of a $450,000
men's dormitory, in accordance with a recently adopted
policy to devote a certain percentage of income from athletics
to the support of some other University project. Final ar
rangements were completed today in an agreement between
the Board and the Trustees of the University.
For what is probably the first time in the history of American college
athletics, development on a huge scale of a non-athletic project will be
financed by profits from the use of the stadium which was heretofore re
garded as a source of income for athletics only. The great earning power of
the stadium, together with the economy effected in its construction, has al
ready practically cleared up the structure's debts, and has thus early placed
it in a position to be made a factor in the increase of the Stanford endowment.
The unexpected decision of the Board of Athletic Control materially ad
vances the building program of, the University.
The new dormitory will be paid for on a long-time basis. The first pay
ment will be made with the $40,000 which accrues to the Advisory Board of the
Stanford Alumni Association, after having been temporarily applied to the
stadium, by agreement with the original contributors.

Construction of the new housing
unit, which is identical in plan with
the dormitory to be built by the Uni
versity itself, will probably be finished
simultaneously with the building first
planned. Both units are a part of
the University housing system which
will eventually include several more
such dormitories to be built within the
next few years the second million of
the endowment to build the third unit
as soon as the money is raised.
These buildings combine all the best
features of housing accommodations
furnished by colleges and universities
all over the country, having been da>
signed after a thorough study had
been made of systems everywhere by
the architects, by President Ray Ly
man Wilbur, and by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
Each of the new units will house
four living groups of thirty each, to
talling 120 men to each unit. The
buildings are planned so as to give
each group one of the four wings of
the dormitory with a living room for
each group and a large clubroom for
all four. In addition to this, one din
ing room is provided for each group,
all four of which will be served by a
common kitchen.
Each wing of the new buildings will
be comprised of fifteen or more two
room suites, which will quarter two
men each. One room in every suite
will be equipped with French windows
so that the best sleeping arrangements
will be provided without being inter
fered with by activities in the other
room —the study. Plenty of light, air,
and running hot and cold water, not
to mention drinking fountains, steam
heat, and rooms for group meetings,
are among the advantages to be offer
ed by these buildings. On the second
floor, above the main club hall there
will be a group of fifteen or more guest
rooms.
The unit to be constructed by the
University itself will be located across
the road which runs north and south
past the east side of Encina Hall, and
will be opposite the Library. When
the housing program is complete, the
first dormitory will be the key build
ing to a quadrangle of living groups
directly east of the educational build
ing. By that time it is expected that
the area now partly occupied by the
Library and Art Gallery will contain
other educational buildings. The next
area to the east, now occupied on the
north by Encina Hall, will probably
be kept as a park for several years.
The dormitory to be finished by the
stadium's income will be across the
road at the east of Encina and will
form the north sidd of the first living
group quadrangle. This will necessi
tate the continuation to Mayfield of
present road running in front of the
quadrangle between Sequoia and En
cina halls. The existing road between
Mayfield and the campus, running
diagonally to the square of the Quad,
back of Encina Hall, will be done
away with next autumn. The south
side of the living group quadrangle
will be formed by the third dormitory

group quadrangle. This will necessi
tate the continuation to Mayfield of
present road running in front of the
quadrangle between Sequoia and En
cina halls. The existing road between
Mayfield and the campus, running
diagonally to the square of the Quad,
back of Encina Hall, will be done
away with next autumn. The south
side of the living group quadrangle
will be formed by the third dormitory
before mentioned.
As in the case of the New Stanford
Union, .the dormitories are all to be
constructed of re-inforced concrete and
will have red-tiled roofs. Buff sand
stone, similar to that used in the
Quad buildings, will be fitted in for
ornamental effects.
The ground for the first building has
already been marked off in readiness
for excavation. Since the architects'
plans are practically complete, it is
hoped that work will begin at once.
It is "planned to have both buildings
finished during the coming academic
year.
