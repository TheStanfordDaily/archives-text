# THE 						NEW DORMITORY AS A CLIMAX
## 
### 
The Board of Athletic Control in agreeing to build a half-million
dollar dormitory from the gate receipts of stadium games has struck a
new note in intercollegiate athletics. Never before in the history of
American colleges has a like move on so great a scale been attempted, nor
could it have been accomplished, even if tried. The circumstances under
which this project was launched were almost wholly new, and it will be
to the vision of the builders of the stadium that Stanford will owe her
second unit in the housing program.
But little over a year ago, Stanford started on a stadium campaign,
raising $200,000 and building the structure within the first half of that
period. And now, in the second half of the year, Stanford with her
stadium practically paid for, resolves to turn her profits into a perpetual
endowment to the University. No finer thing can be said of intercolle
giate athletics.
Stanford stands today the possessor of a stadium known to be one
of the West's greatest engineering achievements in speed and economy
of construction. She stands ready to begin a new year in athletics, prac
tically cleared of what ordinarily would be a great debt.. Stanford has
acquired one of the greatest coaching staffs in America and is prepared
for high rank in physical education. As a climax, today's announcement
that athletics themselves will materially advance the housing program of
the University has no equal in Stanford's history. This is not a year's
work. It is a work worth ten years' time. But it was done in one.
