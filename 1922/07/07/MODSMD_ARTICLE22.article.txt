(Apologies to the Ancient Mariner)
It is a dizzy Flapper
And she stoppeth even he,
"By thy rolled socks and huge ear
puffs,
Now wherefore stoppest thou me?"
She holds him with her dimpled hand
"I have a tag," quoth she.
"Hold off! Unhand me. I've no dough."
Eftsoons her hand dropped she.
She holds him with her flittering eye
The luckless man stands still,
And listens as a three years' child.
The Flapper hath her will.
She holds him with her glittering eye,
His power of movement nil,
He reaches down into his jeans,
The Flapper gets the bill.
"And now I'm broke. O Crumbs!

That ever this should be,
I've no more cash until next month."
A bitter laugh laughed he.
But he is best that buyeth best,
All tags both great and small,
For the sweet one that robbeth us
She needeth and useth all.

How do you make your hash?
We don't make It. It accumulates.

Our latest snake says he's going to
slit his dog's tongue ho he'll have
creases in his pants.

GREAT SOAKS FROM A LITTLE
CORN GROW.
