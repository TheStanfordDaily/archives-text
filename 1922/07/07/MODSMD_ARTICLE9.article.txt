Eddie Sudden, '24, winner of six
points in the sprints of the I. C. A. A.
A. A. competition, May 27, acted as
pacemaker for Charles Paddock, at
Santa Barbara, July 4, when the cham
pion broke four world's sprint records.
Sudden, with a one-foot handicap beat
Paddock to the tape in the 50 and 65-
yard events.
Sudden is probably the smallest
great sprinter in American colleges.
He was a sophomore at Stanford last
year, but has announced his intention
to enter business in San Francisco
without completing his A. B. course.
