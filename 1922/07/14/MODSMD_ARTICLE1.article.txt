# F.A. BETTS TO COACH SECOND STRING GRID SQUAD THIS SEASON
## TO ASSIST ANDREW KERR Former Guard of Card Varsity Will Prepare Scrubs for California "Goofs" 
### 
Forrest Arthur Betts, '18, guard of
the 1921 football varsity, was named
as assistant to Coach Andrew Kerr and
director of the second team for the
coming season, it was stated by an
announcement of the Board of Ath
letic Control, today.
Betts, who is now a student in the
Law School, will assume duties on
September 15. He played guard last
year, and two seasons previously he
worked at the same position with
Coach Bob Evans' team. He has stu
died football under Coaches Powell,
Van Gent, Evans, and Glen Warner
who conducted spring football prac
tice in the stadium.
With a playing schedule of its own,
the second team will require a great
deal more attention than formerly.
It will be part of the new Stanford
football plan to emphasize the work of
the second eleven, using it in par
ticular to develop players from under
classes who have not quite attained
the physical prowess to work with the
varsity. By using them with the sec
ond team the coaches expect to build
varsity players who would otherwise
be lost to football. By rules of eligi
bility certain well qualified men not
allowed with the first-string men, can
play their qualifying year with the
seconds, thus not losing the advantage
of the season's work.
The appointment of Betts comple
tes the coaching staff for the season
beginning in September. Coach
Andrew Kerr of Pittsburgh, Line-
Coach C. E. Thornhill of Center Col
lege, and Assistant Coach F. A. Betts,
Stanford, will be responsible for the
direction of the cardinal gridiron desti
nies of 1922.
