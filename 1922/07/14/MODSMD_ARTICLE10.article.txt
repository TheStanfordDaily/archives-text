# CAMPUS DRAMATISTS TO STAGE "TEA FOR THREE," ON AUGUST 4
## Davis, Seib, Whitney, Will be Principals in Comedy in Assembly Hall 
### 
"Tea For Three," Roi Cooper Me
greu's most notable comedy, ' with
Helen Whitney, Gordon Davis, and
Lester Seib as principal characters,
will be presented in the Stanford As
sembly Hall, Friday, August 4.
The play, first produced in the 1918-
1919 season in New York, attracted
wide comment in that it was centered
almost wholly about three characters,
There are in the cast two servants,
with excellent small parts, but the
action is chiefly with the three prin
cipals.
Helen Whitney is probably the great
est actress brought out during the
Stanford dramatic year just past. Un
like many undergraduate performers,
she is not confined to one type of
character. In "If I Were King," in the
Junior Opera and the Sophomore play
last season, she handled leading roles
of varied nature with equal success.
She probably fared better with the
"critics" than any performer of the
season.
Gordon Davis, head of the Stanford
Dramatics, and Lester Seib, his chief
assistant, are now engaged in a pro
duction at Bohemian Grove, which they
conduct each year.
Last summer Davis and Seib pre
sented "Belinda," as an experiment,
with success that advised a more pre
tentious presentation this August.
Both men are coaches, and only oc
casionally does either take a part be
fore college audiences.
The two men are responsible for the
development in Stanford dramatic
standards which has given the stage
at this University a recognized stand
ing that it now enjoys in college and
professional circles.
