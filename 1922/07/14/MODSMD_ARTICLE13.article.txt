# BOREDOM ONE REASON FOR PROGRESS SAYS ROBINSON IN LECTURE
## FEW GREAT MINDS LEAD Former Professor of History Outlines Development of Man's Mentality 
### 
Tested by his own statement that
one reason for man's progress is that
he is readily bored, the audience at
Professor James Harvey Robinson's
lecture Tuesday evening in the As
sembly Hall, is still in a stage of pre
historic civilization. The signs of
progress simply were not present.
Intellectual bombshells, however,
were present in Professor Robinson's
talk on "How the Mind Looks to a
Student of History." He said in part:
"Although democracy is a nice idea,
as far as history is concerned the
job's been done by excessively few
people. You wouldn't have to cut off
very many heads even today to stop
all advance in our civilization. Most
of us have our minds foisted upon us
by someone else; we have done sur
prisingly little toward the development
of our own mental powers. Ci
vilization is the getting of something
for nothing; it is an historical ac
cumulation which was slow in its
starting but has become more rapid
within the last few centuries.
"The sanctity of tradition, backed
by vested interests along every line,
has held back the advance of progress:
this is especially illustrated in our
educational system. If they want pre
cise, careful thought, educational in
stitutions must divorce moral consi
derations from Scientific investigations.
The present age has more revolution
ary ideas to put over than at any pre
vious time; all older rules are out
lawed and we are new creatures in
a new world.
"Man has operated on certain mat
ter-of-fact laws in practical affairs and
yet has based his religion on myths;
he has always shown an extraordinary
fondness for beliefs that aren't true.
