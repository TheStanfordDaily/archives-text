# BETTER FOOTBALL AND TRACK
## 
### 
With the addition of F. A. Betts the Stanford coaching staff for the
coming year acquires the one element it lacked, that is, one head familiar
with the personalities and past records of the players trying for the var
sity. Coaches Kerr and Thornhill are new to Stanford. Thornhill put
in a busy spring practice with his prospects, and has that advantage, though
Kerr has not yet set foot on the campus.
The appointment of Betts atso puts a young Stanford man on the
staff. Though we have every confidence in Kerr and Thornhill, we should
not like to see a staff coaching a principal sport including no Stanford
talent at all.
It is evident from the announcement today that "Dink'' Templeton
will not he an active member of the staff as he was last year. This means
that Templeton will have time to install regular fall track training, and
round out the system he has had in his mind a long time. Both football
and track aspects of the new appointment are highly pleasing.
WHY IS A JOLLY-UP?
A dance or social function of anv kind to include all members of the
student community is the sort of thing often attempted but seldom fully
accomplished during the normal college year. Interests are too diversi
fied and activities, even with the best arrangements, will conflict.
Stanford, however, has always stood for activity that will bring
together men and women from the different classes, as well as from the
various living groups of the campus, and probably the most successful
social event of the year just closed with the dance which Skull and Snakes
Society conducted at the Pavilion. The success of this affair was due
largely to the presence of practically all women of the campus, made
possible by the use of the motor trucks on a large scale.
A similar dance will be given at Roble tonight, without the motor
trucks, as all of the women on the campus now live at the Hall, and the
fact that they are hostesses guarantees that all of them will be present.
A feature that will not be unnoticed is that the men students do not out
number the women so badly during the summer.
At a Stanford a jolly-up only Stanford students are in attendance.
Either all dances are "tags," or "cut-ins" are favored in every other dance.
Introductions are presumed all round, and everybody pays his own way.
WORTH SOME NOTICE
Gordon Davis is Stanford's dramatic coach. His work has attracted
national attention. Lester Seib produced the Junior Opera when he was
a sophomore, and has been producing them ever since. To include either
in a play cast during the normal year would insure a full house.
"Tea for Three" will offer the unique opportunity of seeing the two
actors perform in the same play. This, together with the fact that Helen
Whitney, probably the most versatile actress among the undergraduates,
will play with them in a play of three principal characters, inidcates that
the production next month will attract quite some attention in this section
of the Peninsula.
THOSE ONE OR TWO frosh dinks we have seen—in fact, the whole
half dozen of them—about the Farm this summer look pretty well. The
small grey cap means the wearer is here to stay (if he can) ; that he means
to be one of us; that he is willing to recognize tradition at least until he
knows enough about it to offer reason why it should be changed; and
we are glad to welcome him among us.
