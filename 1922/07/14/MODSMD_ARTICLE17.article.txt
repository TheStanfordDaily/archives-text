## HAVE YOU SEEN CHAUNCEY? 
### 
Now Chauncey McFathead Xantippe
Depew,
Was the kind of a guy that everyone
knew,
He battled the bones and the booze in
a way
That passed comprehension and time
of the day.
He knew all the wiles and the ways of
his time
And lived for a week on the sum of
a dime,
If hard luck approached him he always
knew when.
For he spent half his life on a term in
the pen.
The parsons in horror would turn up
their eyes.
When Chauncey turned up again walk
ing the ties.
He'd come into town with a ball and
chain gait
Take a chew of tobacco and expec
torate.
The Old Ladies' Circle would whisper
his name
To the tune of a scandal but never
the same,
Rut Chauncey would chuckle and chew
on his quid.
And wish he had done what they all
thought he did.
His bad reputation he couldn't live
down.
He played the bad part of a man
about town.
His credit was rotten for his was the
case $
Of a man who is broke on account of
his face.
His mug was unshaven, his hair was
a sight,
When most people saw him they
fainted with fright;
He lost in his day a square mile of
skin
By wiping the back of his hand on
his chin.
His ears were enormous, his voice
was a scream,

He looked like the end of a horrible
dream,
His knees knocked together and both
feet were flat,
New what in the hell do you know
about that?
This picture distorted and grotesque
and drab
Is one that is easy to grasp or to
grab,
For Chauncey may be a sweet saint
in disguise,
He's everyone's picture of those they
despise.
Now if to philosophy you are in
clined.
You'll note that all faults are quite
easy to find,
For though you're an angel, an imp,
or an elf,
Somebody will think you're Chauncey
yourself.
