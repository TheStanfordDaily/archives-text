In these days of radio telephone pub
licity when the public mind is keyed
up to the anticipation of great develop
ments in the radio field, it is an in
teresting fact that the first demon
strations of the vast possibilities of
the radio telephone were made by the
scientists and engineers of the Bell
System back in 1915.
Speech was successfully transmitted
that year from New York City over
the wire of the Bell System to the
radio station at Arlington, Va., and
thence by wireless to the radio station
at Mare Island, Cal.
Later that year, a still more re
markable demonstration was made by
the Bell System engineers, when words
spoken into the radio telephone at
Arlington, Va., were heard with re
markable clearness at the Eiffel tower
in Paris and in the Hawaiian Islands.
This demonstration established a long
distance radia telephone record which
has never been surpassed.
