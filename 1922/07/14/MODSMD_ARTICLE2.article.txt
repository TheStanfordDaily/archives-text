# "Jimmy" Ross Entered In Ring Tournament
## 
### 
Jimmie Ross, '23, 145-pound boxer,
is entered in the Southern California
amateur boxing championships. The
list of entries in the south state tour
nament is growing rapidly, and now
includes some of the best mitt artists
in the west, among them Paddy Dillon
of San Francisco, Far Western ama
teur lightweight champion.
Ross decisively defeated Benny Ein
zig, nationad amateur champion of his
class, in the California-Stanford bouts
last winter, and it is probable that
Ross will himself be entered in the
next national competition.
