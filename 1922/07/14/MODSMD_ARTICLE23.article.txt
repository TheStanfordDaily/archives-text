## 
### 
Among the bookplates which the
Library has placed on exhibition in
the case to the left of the main flight
cf steps, one of the most interesting
is that of Antoine Laurent Lavoisier.
M. Lavosier was the chief founder of
n odern chemistry and the book that
contains his plate is a work of alchemy
which is one of the Grimaux collec
tion recently purchased by the Stan
ford Library in Paris.
The bookplate exhibit contains some
excellent examples of the work of im
portant English and American design
ers and engravers. The plates of the
novelist, Frances Marion Crawford,
end of Doctor Casey A. Wood, are par
ticularly attractive. George Arnold,
Sir George Nugent, and John Adding
ton Symonds are among the names in
the collection of armorial plates.
Among the members of the Stanford
faculty who loaned their bookplates
'.o the exhibit are Dr. Jordan, Barbara
Jordan, Professor Eliot G. Mears, Miss
Margaret M. Lothrop, and Lillien J.
Martin. Various universities and other
institutions have plates in the collec
tion; the Stanford jewel fund book
plate was designed by F. H. Blash
ford and is one of the most attractive
in the exhibit.
The Library recently placed the
bronze bust of the late Ewald Flugel
at the end of the corridor leading to
the periodical room. Professor Flugel
was a member of the Stanford faculty
from his appointment in 1892 from
Leipzig University, until shortly be
fore his death in 1915. He was the
head of the Department of Philology
until it merged into the English de
partment. The bust was presented
to the University in 1915 by the facul
ty, graduates, and friends of the Eng
lish department. It is the work of
Ralph Stackpole, a San Francisco
sculptor, and is said by friends of
Professor Flugel to be an excellent
likeness.
