##

versity of Southern California, will
play one another for the championship
of the Southern Pacific Coast Confer
ence in the coming basketball sea
son, while the four Oregon and Wash
ington colleges, together with the
University of Idaho, play for the north
ern title, according to a recent agree
ment made between the graduate man
agers of the Coast Conference Univer
sities. No games will be played be
tween Northern and Southern section
teams except for the championship of
the entire conference when the win
ners of their respective sections will
meet.
The same number of games will be
played by. every team, thus avoiding
the percentage difficulties in compara
tive standing which have been pre-
sented in previous years. Each of the
Northern teams will play two games
with each of the other four, while the
Southern teams will meet each other
four times.
In case any series of games results
in a tie between two universities, a
deciding game will be played, but this

California may each win two games
in competition with each other, and
though Stanford wins the play-off she
receives no credit in the percentage
column other than the ranking posi
tion. She would, however, win the
right to play the Northern champion
for the Coast title. Under this system
of scheduling games, there can be no
doubt as to the victor. A tie is im
possible for first place.
