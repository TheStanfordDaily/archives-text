# Feature Program Will Mark Organ Recital
## 
### 
Part Five of "Pilgrim's Progress," by
Earnest Austin, will be featured in
the organ recital by Warren D. Allen
in the Memorial Church, next Sunday
afternoon. This narrative tone poem
in twelve parts, which Mr. Allen is
playing in consecutive order during
the summer recitals, is considered
one of the most monumental works
ever written for the organ and per
haps the only composition of its kind
based upon one theme.
The familiar story is described in
the music by means of the same sys
tem of leading motives that Wagner
employed in his musical dramas. The
concerts Sunday, July 16, and Tuesday,
July 18, will describe Pilgrim's journey
to the Palace Beautiful.
Other compositions to be played on
Sunday and Tuesday are, Schubert's
"By the Sea," and works by Bach
and Rossetter Cole.
