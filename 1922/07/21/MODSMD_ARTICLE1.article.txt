# 'DAD' MOULTON DIES AT PALO ALTO HOME AFTER LONG SERVICE
## WAS 74 YEARS OF AGE Card Trainer Was Nationally Known as Developer of World Champions 
### 
Edward W. "Dad" Moulton, aged 74,
veteran trainer and coach, and for the
last twenty years closely connected
with Stanford athletics, died at his
home at 336 Middlefield, Palo Alto, at
noon Wednesday, after a day's illness.
Mrs. Moulton and a son survive him.
The funeral services will be held
at the Memorial Church, this after
noon, at 3:00. Athletes who have
worked under Moulton will act as
pall-bearers. The Fremont Post of
the American Legion will furnish a
guard of honor, as the deceased was
a Civil War veteran.
Moulton was born at St. Anthony's
Falls, Minnesota, in 1849, and was
the second white child born in the
settlement. At the age of fifteen he
took part in the Civil War, giving his
age to the enlistment officers as seven
teen. After a partial participation in
Sherman's march to the sea, he was
invalided home, in 1566 he joined a
scouting expedition to Helena, Mont,
then known as Last Chance Gulch.
He served as a scout to the same place
in 1867 with Colonel Fiske's expedition
and was engaged in several Indian
skirmishes. It was during his work
on the frontier that he found he was
gifted with great speed, proving his
ability by beating Indians in dozens
of footraces. A year later when he
was beaten for the first time by a pro
fessional runner he saw his first pair
of running shoes and decided to go
into sprinting on a professional basis
—a career that lasted for nineteen
years, in the course of which he ran
306 scheduled races, losing but four.
He was at the height of his career
regarded as the champion of America.
He competed with and defeated such
men of the old school as Laiidaker,
Allison, Crandall, Stone, Kendricks,
Kelly, Davis, Cozad, Shull, Huntley,
Reed, Coates, Adsetts, George Wells,
J. Wheat, and Jim Harris.
Moulton trained Harry M. Johnson
in his best days when the latter was
champion of America in the short
sprints. The youthful trainer then
took James Collins to England and
won the Sheffield Handicap in Febru
ary 1890. In 1891 he trained the Uni
versity of Minnesota football team,
winning ten straight games. He had
charge of the Chicago Cycling Club in
1892 and won sight. In
1893 he trained the Michigan football
team and in 1898 went to lowa. Dur
ing the summer of 1895 he trained Pye
Bliss and Tommie Cooper, winning
forty-four firsts in bicycle races with
these two men.
He returned to lowa in the fall of
'95 and stayed all year training both
football and track teams. He returned
to the University of Minnesota in '96
and then went to the University of
Wisconsin in '97, where he developed
James MaybUry into intercollegiate
sprint champion. He then coached
and trained Kraenzlein, the Missouri
hurdler who was intercollegiate
champion in all hurdle races and won
five first places at the national meet
in Chicago. Kraenzlein. under the
tutelage of Moulton was the, first man
to practice the modern style of hurd
ling.
Before leaving the eastern field,
Moulton coached and trained the track
teams of Notre Dame and Vanderbilt
Universities. He came to Stanford
in 1902, and after the training seasons
in 1906, 1907 and 1910 coached the
track teams at Pacific University, Wil
lamette and Santa Clara.
Moulton's second year at Stanford
was rewarded by the first Cardinal
victory over the University of Cali
fornia in track, since the beginning

of Stanford. In the next eighteen
years, the initial act was repeated
quile frequently. In the course of his
career as Cardinal coach, "Dad" Moul
ton brought out such champions as
Norman Dole, '04, George Horrine, ex
'l4, Fred Crawford, '09, Feg Murray,
'16, Johnny Norton, '16, Bill Sisson,
'16, L. S. Scott, and Paul Wilson, ex
'ls.
The running track in the Stanford
Stadium would have been the fifteenth
in Moulton's carer as a cinder-path
builder. He has built tracks at Notre
Dame, lowa, Minnesota, Michigan,
Wisconsin, VandeYbilt, Stanford, and
for the Panama Pacific Exposition in
San Francisco, in 1915. He also con
structed the ovals for the Lewis and
Clarke Exposition at Portland and for
the Centennial at Astoria.
Coach and trainer of college men,
wrestlers, boxers, bicyclists, and gym
nasts, manager of wild west shows, an
intimate of Buffalo Bill Cody's, cham
pion athlete in his day, track builder,
Indian fighter, scout and guide, "Dad"
Moulton has left the world a "master
of many arts."

sprints. The youthful trainer then
took James Collins to England and
won the Sheffield Handicap in Febru
ary 1890. In 1891 he trained the Uni
versity of Minnesota football team,
winning ten straight games. He had
charge of the Chicago Cycling Club in

'95 and stayed all year training both
football and track teams. He returned
to the University of Minnesota in '96
and then went to the University of
Wisconsin in '97, where he developed
James MaybUry into intercollegiate
sprint champion. He then coached
and trained Kraenzlein, the Missouri
hurdler who was intercollegiate
champion in all hurdle races and won
five first places at the national meet
in Chicago. Kraenzlein. under the
tutelage of Moulton was the, first man
to practice the modern style of hurd
ling.
Before leaving the eastern field,
Moulton coached and trained the track
teams of Notre Dame and Vanderbilt
Universities. He came to Stanford
in 1902, and after the training seasons
in 1906, 1907 and 1910 coached the
track teams at Pacific University, Wil
lamette and Santa Clara.
Moulton's second year at Stanford
was rewarded by the first Cardinal
victory over the University of Cali
fornia in track, since the beginning

of Stanford. In the next eighteen
years, the initial act was repeated
quile frequently. In the course of his
career as Cardinal coach, "Dad" Moul
ton brought out such champions as
Norman Dole, '04, George Horrine, ex
'l4, Fred Crawford, '09, Feg Murray,
'16, Johnny Norton, '16, Bill Sisson,
'16, L. S. Scott, and Paul Wilson, ex
'ls.
The running track in the Stanford
Stadium would have been the fifteenth
in Moulton's carer as a cinder-path
builder. He has built tracks at Notre
Dame, lowa, Minnesota, Michigan,
Wisconsin, VandeYbilt, Stanford, and
for the Panama Pacific Exposition in
San Francisco, in 1915. He also con
structed the ovals for the Lewis and
Clarke Exposition at Portland and for
the Centennial at Astoria.
Coach and trainer of college men,
wrestlers, boxers, bicyclists, and gym
nasts, manager of wild west shows, an
intimate of Buffalo Bill Cody's, cham
pion athlete in his day, track builder,
Indian fighter, scout and guide, "Dad"
Moulton has left the world a "master
of many arts."
Edward W. "Dad" Moulton, aged 74,
veteran trainer and coach, and for the
last twenty years closely connected
with Stanford athletics, died at his
home at 336 Middlefield, Palo Alto, at
noon Wednesday, after a day's illness.
Mrs. Moulton and a son survive him.
The funeral services will be held
at the Memorial Church, this after
noon, at 3:00. Athletes who have
worked under Moulton will act as
pall-bearers. The Fremont Post of
the American Legion will furnish a
guard of honor, as the deceased was
a Civil War veteran.
Moulton was born at St. Anthony's
Falls, Minnesota, in 1849, and was
the second white child born in the
settlement. At the age of fifteen he
took part in the Civil War, giving his
age to the enlistment officers as seven
teen. After a partial participation in
Sherman's march to the sea, he was
invalided home, in 1566 he joined a
scouting expedition to Helena, Mont,
then known as Last Chance Gulch.
He served as a scout to the same place
in 1867 with Colonel Fiske's expedition
and was engaged in several Indian
skirmishes. It was during his work
on the frontier that he found he was
gifted with great speed, proving his
ability by beating Indians in dozens
of footraces. A year later when he
was beaten for the first time by a pro
fessional runner he saw his first pair
of running shoes and decided to go
into sprinting on a professional basis
—a career that lasted for nineteen
years, in the course of which he ran
306 scheduled races, losing but four.
He was at the height of his career
regarded as the champion of America.
He competed with and defeated such
men of the old school as Laiidaker,
Allison, Crandall, Stone, Kendricks,
Kelly, Davis, Cozad, Shull, Huntley,
Reed, Coates, Adsetts, George Wells,
J. Wheat, and Jim Harris.

Edward W. "Dad" Moulton, aged 74,

with Stanford athletics, died at his

noon Wednesday, after a day's illness.
Mrs. Moulton and a son survive him.

Moulton was born at St. Anthony's
Falls, Minnesota, in 1849, and was
the second white child born in the
settlement. At the age of fifteen he
took part in the Civil War, giving his
age to the enlistment officers as seven
teen. After a partial participation in
Sherman's march to the sea, he was
invalided home, in 1566 he joined a
scouting expedition to Helena, Mont,
then known as Last Chance Gulch.
He served as a scout to the same place
in 1867 with Colonel Fiske's expedition
and was engaged in several Indian
skirmishes. It was during his work
on the frontier that he found he was
gifted with great speed, proving his
ability by beating Indians in dozens
of footraces. A year later when he
was beaten for the first time by a pro
fessional runner he saw his first pair
of running shoes and decided to go
into sprinting on a professional basis
—a career that lasted for nineteen
years, in the course of which he ran
306 scheduled races, losing but four.
He was at the height of his career
regarded as the champion of America.
He competed with and defeated such
men of the old school as Laiidaker,
Allison, Crandall, Stone, Kendricks,
Kelly, Davis, Cozad, Shull, Huntley,
Reed, Coates, Adsetts, George Wells,
J. Wheat, and Jim Harris.
Moulton trained Harry M. Johnson
in his best days when the latter was
champion of America in the short
sprints. The youthful trainer then
took James Collins to England and
won the Sheffield Handicap in Febru
ary 1890. In 1891 he trained the Uni
versity of Minnesota football team,
winning ten straight games. He had
charge of the Chicago Cycling Club in
1892 and won sight. In
1893 he trained the Michigan football
team and in 1898 went to lowa. Dur
ing the summer of 1895 he trained Pye
Bliss and Tommie Cooper, winning
forty-four firsts in bicycle races with
these two men.
He returned to lowa in the fall of
'95 and stayed all year training both
football and track teams. He returned
to the University of Minnesota in '96
and then went to the University of
Wisconsin in '97, where he developed
James MaybUry into intercollegiate
sprint champion. He then coached
and trained Kraenzlein, the Missouri
hurdler who was intercollegiate
champion in all hurdle races and won
five first places at the national meet
in Chicago. Kraenzlein. under the
tutelage of Moulton was the, first man
to practice the modern style of hurd
ling.
Before leaving the eastern field,
Moulton coached and trained the track
teams of Notre Dame and Vanderbilt
Universities. He came to Stanford
in 1902, and after the training seasons
in 1906, 1907 and 1910 coached the
track teams at Pacific University, Wil
lamette and Santa Clara.
Moulton's second year at Stanford
was rewarded by the first Cardinal
victory over the University of Cali
fornia in track, since the beginning

of Stanford. In the next eighteen
years, the initial act was repeated
quile frequently. In the course of his
career as Cardinal coach, "Dad" Moul
ton brought out such champions as
Norman Dole, '04, George Horrine, ex
'l4, Fred Crawford, '09, Feg Murray,
'16, Johnny Norton, '16, Bill Sisson,
