# DEAN CHARLES ANDREWS HUSTON
## 
### 
Barely in the prime of life, when his work, great though it was, was
a mere beginning in what he would have accomplished had the normal
allotment of years been allowed him, Dean Huston Wednesday was sud
denly called to the other land. Death has taken one of Stanford's strong
est men.
He will be mourned as a scholar lost to the world. As a student in
legal theory, he had spent twenty-five years in learning and investigation,
and he leaves this world just after reaching the stage in his life work
when he could best make it of benefit to others. To Stanford he was more
than a scholar, for Charles Andrews Huston was the type of law school
leader who knew his students, individually, as professional advisors, and
all as personal friends.
Dean Huston, with wide experience and breadth of training, did not
confine his University interest to the Law Department. No man has had
more in heart the development of all Stanford, and his administration of
the Law School and its inter-relation with other departments of the Uni
versity was marked by this viewpoint.
Stanford realizes keenly the loss of a strong man, and a beloved leader.
