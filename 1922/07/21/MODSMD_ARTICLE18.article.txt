# PASSING OF "DAD" MOULTON
## 
### 
All Stanford and all the sports world mourns today the death of
Edward W. Moulton, the most experienced and most widely known
trainer in America, the coach of a hundred Cardinal heroes, the holder
of world's records himself in days gone by, and at all times a staunch
friend of athletics in college and out. The sympathy of all is extended
to his widow and son.
For twenty years "Dad" was the center of athletic activity on the
Farm, the molder of track destinies, the untiring force that kept Stan
ford men at their best both mentally and physically. His coming brought
Stanford out of the shadow of thirteen years' defeat and his going leaves
the University in a shadow of deep sorrow. In losing "Dad" Moulton,
Stanford has lost her senior in athletics, a man gentle in victory, courage
ous in defeat, and always a champion of fair play. Stanford has lost a
coach, a trainer, a real man â€”and a friend.
