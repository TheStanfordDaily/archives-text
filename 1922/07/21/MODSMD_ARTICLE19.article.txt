# THE 						UNION—A COMMUNITY CENTER
## 
### 
When Herbert Hoover some years ago decided that there was some
thing wrong with student life at Stanford, lie proceeded to launch some
project by which the undergraduate body would again become united.
There had been fights and factional jealousies in his day, but his more
mature view on his return to the University sensed some greater division
of classes among the students. The Old Stanford Union was the result
of his efforts to correct this situation.
Today, the New Stanford Union, profiting by mistakes made in earlier
years, bids fair to achieve the ideal that motivated the first act toward
the concentration of student life alxmt one place. A common meeting
place that is at the same time a common eating place, in pleasant sur-
cannot over-night accomplish the desired ends. It is not
enough. But when the headquarters of student activities, the offices of
organizations, have been transferred to such a place —the Union—a real
center of student life will have been established.
Complaints are continually raised alxnit the rooms, the food, and the
service at the New Union. That, of course, is inevitable. No new
accommodations were ever introduced to the campus without having to
submit to a constant stream of criticism. It is inherent in the Stanford
student to kick—otherwise he and his kind would not be satisfied and he
would have accomplished less. In the old Inn, the food was rotten and
he waited on himself. In the New Union, he doesn't get so much for his
money. Having accustomed himself to eating philosophically anything
that appeared before him on a marble-topped table in a questionable state
of sanitation, he objects to the sudden raise in price for better food, but
less of it, on a clean tablecloth.
Those who refuse to be reconciled to the new order will have their
chance to reduce eating expenses at the beginning of the autumn quarter
when the basement of the Old Union will be fitted with a late-hour lunch
counter. It will be run in a college coffee house style and ought to satisfy
the most exacting of students in the matter of food and price.
It is planned to establish such cooperative student concerns as are
considered necessary from time to time in the New I nion building, thus
gradually bringing all campus attractions to the community center.
It is difficult to see how Hoover's ideal can fail to materialize. It is
merely a matter of student interest and cooperation which will determine
the number of months and years that separate the present from the
achievebent of that purpose.
