# EX-PRESIDENT TAFT MAY VISIT CAMPUS
## 
### 
Ex-President William Howard Taft
will attend the convention of the
American Bar Association to be held
in San Francisco during the week of
August 10, and there is a possibility
that he will visit the campus to ad
dress a student assembly.
Every effort is being made here, par
ticularly by Professor Edwin A. Cot
trell of the Political Science depart
ment, to induce Mr. Taft to include
the Stanford Campus in his schedule,
but as yet no definite answer has been
received. Ex-President Taft is at the
present time enjoying a vacation in
the Canadian woods.
