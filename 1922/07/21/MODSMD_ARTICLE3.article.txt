## 
### 
James Davies, '22, was yester
day the sensation of the Long
wood Tennis Tournament, when
he gave R. Norris Williams, 11,
member of the American Davis
cup team, and present holder of
the Longwood title, one of the
severest battles of his career.
Davis forced the champion to
twenty games in the first set,
finally losing to him 11-9, and
coming back to win the second
set 6-4. Williams took the next
two sets.
Phil Neer, '22, was forced to
withdraw from the Longwood
competition with an injured
knee. Richard Hinckley, '24,
was eliminated by N. W. Niles.
