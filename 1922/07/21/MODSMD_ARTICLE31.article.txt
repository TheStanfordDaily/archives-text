# Six Layers of New Stadium Track Now Ready for Cinders
## 
### 
Dad Moulton, on his last visit to the
stadium Tuesday, announced the new
Stanford oval in the howl practically
complete to the laying of cinders, which
have been purchased in Vancouver and
should arrive Saturday or Monday.
The new Stanford track should in a
year's time he among the fastest in the
country. Moulton has huilt more ovals
than any other man in the United States,,
some eighteen in all, including the track
at the Panama-Pacific Exposition, as
well as several belonging to prominent,
eastern universities.
In the stadium the new oval will lie
between substantial cement curbings.
The first layer of track foundation is
gravel, upon which is another of crushed'
rock. A layer of hardwood shavings,,
one more of crushed rock, another of
shavings, and one of soft clay, all com-'
pactly and firmly rolled, complete the
oval in its present condition. A proper
mixture of clay and cinders for the final
surface will be put on during the next
two weeks, after which Stanford track
men should be able to forget such ail
ments as shin splints and similar troubles
coming from hard running lanes.
Circles for the shot, discus, and pos
sibly hammer will be prepared on the
turf, but not on the football playing
field. The javelin will probably be
thrown crosswise.
