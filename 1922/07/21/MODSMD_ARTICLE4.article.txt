# HISTORY EXTENSION OF MEMORY SAYS JAMES H. ROBINSON
## 
### 
"History is nothing more than a de
vice to explain the foolish things we do;
we can never know how things are with
out knowing how they came about." This
was Professor James Harvey Robinson's
answer to the question, "What's the Use
of History?" in his lecture Monday aft
ernoon in the Little Theater.
Professor Robinson regards history as
an extension of man's personal memory
and just as one uses his memory to help
him size up a situation, so history is
nothing more than a genetic approach to
human affairs. The speaker traccd the
development of history as a science from
the geological records of prehistoric ages
down to the present time when volumin
ous documents record important happen
ings. The temptation to make history
good reading, first evidenced in Herod
otus, still influences modern historians,
Robinson believes.
From its beginning as a chronicle of
the conduct of rulers history has been
written to prove the point of
view. This apologetic form of history
was succeeded by the humanistic period;
then in the middle of the eighteenth cen
tury, historians became philosophers and
tried to teach their generation by the
example of the past. Their acceptance
of history was naive; conflicting prem
ises were proven by the same records.
The tendency to assume that the go,v
ernnient is the most important aspect
has brought about modern political his
tory.
Professor Robinson thinks that objec
tive history is impossible, due to the
mass of records which the historian must
study to get both sides of a question.
These records naturally are partisan,
and so the writer can only approach his
subject with an unbiased mind, and be
willing to forego a good story if it isn't
true.
