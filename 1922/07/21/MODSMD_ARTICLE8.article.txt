# MacMURRAY CONCERT MARKED BY ORIGINAL AND CLEAN TECHNIQUE
## 
### 
Clean and original technique marked
the playing of Frederick Mac Murray,
in his viola concert, Tuesday evening
in the Little Theatre. This was the
first musical event of the summer
quarter and the audience showed keen
interest in Mac Murray's novel ac
complishments on the viola. Mac-
Murray is a master of the violin, but
has chosen the viola as his favprite
concert instrument because, b«ing
deeper in tone, he can best get the
effects desired. By sustaining three
tones simultaneously instead of rolling
the bow and letting go of the lowest
string, Mac Murray obtains the effect
of an accompaniment, carrying the
melody at the same time.
This method was demonstrated in
the Tuesday evening program which
was made up of his own compositions
and adaptations of folk songs. Lack
of variety somewhat detracted from
his hold on the audience but the un
expected tone color made possible by
double and triple "stopping proved in
teresting.
The program included an Impromptu,
an Orientale, a melodious lullaby, a
romantic composition called "Venice,"
a barcarolle, a Norwegian air, and a
number of folk songs. Included in the
last named were "Carry Me Back to
Old Virginny," "The Last Rose of
Summer," "Alice, Where Art Thou?"
and "Drink to Me Only With Thine
Eyes."
