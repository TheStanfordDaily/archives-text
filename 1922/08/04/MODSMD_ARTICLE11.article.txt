# ANOTHER FAREWELL
## 
### 
Because dramatic managers for publicity purposes advertised a
former appearance of Lester Seib as his "farewell," to Stanford audi
ences, he does not wish his participation in "Tea for Three," to night, to
be heralded as another final "good-bye." As a matter of fact, tonight's
show will mark his last appearance as a student actor, for lie has signed
with T. Daniel Frawley as a juvenile man and will leave San Francisco
August 7 for a year of engagements, playing from Honolulu to Cairo.
With the inclusion of Dramatic Coach Gordon Davis, Helen Whit
ney, and Lester Seib in the production of "Tea for Three," the cast of
tonight's comedy is without exaggeration far stronger than any that has
worked before Stanford audiences within the memory of students now
on the campus. And this is more than an idle tribute, as student pro
ductions in the past two years under Coach Davis have attracted more
than mere local attention.
Davis and Seib are without doubt the strongest men ever developed
in Stanford dramatics. Helen Whitney is a college actress who hds
carried successfully more than the common "girlie girl" parts. Unlike
many student actresses, she can act. The arrangement by which all three
are brought together in "Tea for Three" will present a unique chapter
in the history of the Stanford stage.
