# THE 						GYMNASIUM DIRECTOR
## 
### 
Dr. William Hulbert Barrow, newly appointed head of the Stanford
Physical Education Department, and who has but recently arrived on
the campus, comes to take charge of a new organization in local athletic
administration. Together with his experience as a doctor, the new chief
has practical ideas regarding the relation of athletics to the students as a
whole, and with his opportunity to put his ideas into effect, he will un
doubtedly contribute something to the fields of college physical education.
Dr. Barrow is a defender of the "dub" in athletics, according to his
own words. He will probably include in his program measures to care
for this type of man and in so doing he will develop a part of this sort
of education which has been pretty largely neglected everywhere in the
past.
The new director of Encina gymnasium will work at the head of a
group of specialists, each an authority in his particular branch of en
deavor. It will be his duty to coordinate the efforts of these men to
bring about the best total results.
Stanford may well expect an interesting and instructive growth in
her physical education department under the supervision of the new Boss
of Encina Gym.
