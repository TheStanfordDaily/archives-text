Critics attribute success of many prominent football coaches to their
ability as schedule makers. Translated, this means that they refrain
from playing teams they cannot beat.
Whatever may be said of the new Stanford coaches, Andrew Kerr
and Claude Thornhill, they will not be designated as schedule makers.
Kerr's word to the Graduate Manager on making up the schedule was
to "use your own judgment and pick the best teams." Fletcher has done
so, and as a result local football fans will see the best elevens of the
Pacific coast in action against the Cardinals in the Stanford stadium.
Since returning to American football, Stanford's record has not
been as successful as we would like it to be, for we have not beaten our
chief rival. California. However, no other conference team has regis
tered a victory over Stanford, and this notwithstanding we have always
"taken them as they came." We are gratified to note the attitude of the
new coaches. It indicates that they do their coaching on the playing
field, and that they are ready to meet all comers. If the time ever comes
that Stanford has to "make" her schedule, we hope to see football at that
time abandoned.
