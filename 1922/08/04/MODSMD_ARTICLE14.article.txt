LOOTING THE GOLD AND BLUE
Well, you've heard men tell of the
Northern hell
Where the snow king reigr.s su
preme,
Of Dan McGrew and his motley
crew
As wild as a mad man's dream.
But I bid you wait while I relate
A story that's weird but true,
Yet tell no word where this occurred —
The looting of the Gold and Blue.
In a town not far from here to tliar
Where the Golden Bear holds sway,
Where the football team is called su
preiry^,
And the rooters have had their day,
There stands a bank high up in rank.
No guardians it lacks
For in its vaults, for all its faults.
It guards the Stanford Ax.
And the Stanford Red fat tears lias shed
At the loss of this great tool
Which hacked the necks of the East Bay
wrecks
Who claimed the East Bay school,
But their efforts fraught with ire
brought naught,
1 he story was e'er the same;
These are the facts, they kept the Ax
To which the Cards lay claim.
When a Cardinal son on a bun
And tries this tool to take
The Berkeley crew with rage turns blue
And all relations break;
A compromise this group decries,
The Ax is theirs, they say;
To let the victor take the tool
Might let the Reds hold sway.
And so with sniffs at these dumb stiffs
The Cardinals built a team
That sent with lopes the Berkeley hopes
lo worthless from supreme;
Though Stanford lacks the actual Ax
Its spirit stays on deck,
In coming fights the Berkeleyites
Will get it in the neck.
