# "RETIREMENT IS AN OPPORTUNITY," SAYS DR. BAILEY WILLIS
## 
### 
Retirement, to Dr. Bailey Willis at
least, means simply the opportunity to
do the many things which teaching has
crowded out of the busy years. Dr.
Willis has been head of the Geology de
partment at Stanford since 1915 and his
retirement this summer will not mean
losing touch with the department. Dr.
Branner's office has been given to him
and students are to consult him there
whenever they choose.
Before coming to Stanford, Dr. Willis,
as a research geologist, traveled in many
lands—China, the Argentine, Patagonia,
and what was then the pioneer West;
these were some of the way points in
"the Jong trail."
Speaking of his retirement, Dr. Willis
said:
"Some of my colleagues, still young in
years but old in habits, greet me solemn
ly: 'So you are retiring!' Others ex
claim: "What an opportunity!' To the
man who has the habit of routine, change
is the end. But he who has the habit of
variety turns eagerly to the new out
look; and he knows the satisfaction of
closing the day with accomplishment and
of greeting the morning with new pur
pose.
"Yes, I have enjoyed teaching. There
is a sense of power in knowing what you
know and making others know it —until
you read examination papers. I like to
lecture. In every class there are stu
dents whose quick reaction is a joy, or
doubters whose skepticism is a challenge.
And students are so much more interest
ing than rocks; such deep, dark riddles!
"But the best part of teaching is fel
lowship. We enjoy our full share of it
in the Geology department. There we
make friends who stay with us four
years or six, and then, going out into the
world, broaden our human relation.;.
Men come back from the Orient, from
Africa, from South America, from
everywhere, and they tell us how good
it is to greet the old friends 011 the Farm.
They do not volunteer much about their
adventures, though their poise tells of
experience. But they have the Stanford
stamp, they have put the Stanford qual
ity into their work, they make us glad
they came to Stanford. That is the great
satisfaction of having taught.
"Of course I am proud of the depart
ment. It is one of the best in the coun
try. Not long ago a puzzled visitor, see
ing empty classrooms, asked me: 'Where
is the University?' I tapped my fore
head : 'In the heads of the professors and
Students.' Dr. Branner, the founder of
the Geology department, was more than
an individual professor. He was a great
human man, a driving force of tremen

dous power, and his influence continues
to animate the department to which he
gave its traditions of fellowship in work
and aspiration. His colleagues carry on
strongly and the future is full of prom
ise for growth and increased usefulness
to the students and to Stanford."
