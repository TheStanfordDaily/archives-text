dred representatives from the colleges

retary of the national Y. VV. C. A. stu
dent department, is the executive head
of the conference. She and Miss Alice
Hoyt, field secretary of the Pacific coast,
met with the undergraduate representa
tives of the California cabinets Monday
for a pre-conference discussion of the
student problems.
Two series of daily addresses are tak
ing the place of the usual classes at the
conference; this change was made neces
sary by the enforced reduction of the
national budget. In addition to the ad
dresses, there are forums, technical
hours, and special discussion groups
based on the daily addresses. To a much
greater extent than ever before, the stu
dents are taking the initiative in their
conference this summer. Among the
leaders are Mrs. Catherine Willard
Eddy, Miss Rhoda McCulloch, editor of
the Association Monthly, Miss Ellen
Smith, national finance secretary, Dr.
Howard Dean French, pastor of the Con
gregational Church in Los Angeles, and

cific Grove 011 the Bay of Monterey, and
the conference program includes trips to
the many places of historic interest in
Monterey, Carmel. and Pacific Grove.
One afternoon will be devoted to a trip
to Point Lobos by way of the famed
