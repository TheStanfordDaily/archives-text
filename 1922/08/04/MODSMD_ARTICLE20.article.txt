# 'STANFORD FIELD' IN PALO ALTO WILL BE DEVELOPEDâ€”DECISION
## 
### 
The famous "Stanford Field" of 40
acres, picturesquely located and bounded
by the State highway, Evergreen Park,
Alma street and Churchill avenue, has
been released by Stanford University
for home sites, it was announced today
at the office of M. H. Tichenor & Co. of
Palo Alto, who will have charge of the
marketing of the property. Papers are
being passed through the Tichenor office
conveying the field (lot 40 of the Stan
ford University land) to A. W. Edwards.
This field for some time has been a
part and parcel of the city of Palo Alto,
as the corporation boundaries extend
around the entire acreage.
Because of the extraordinary setting
which the property has, with its large
frontage 011 the main boulevard and
facing the university campus and the
foothills, with the fine residence section
of South Palo Alto and the artistic Union
High School buildings for a background,
this acreage lias been looked upon by
those seeking homes in this community
as a most desirable location, but hitherto
has been unavailable because of being
Stanford University property and not for
sale.
BENEFITS FORESEEN
The University trustees and Comp
troller A. E. Roth believe two great
things will be accomplished by releasing
this acreage: First, the proceeds from
the sale of the property will be more
beneficial to the University than holding
the land; second, the community will be
greatly benefited by having the property
utilized for residential purposes.
Mr. and Mrs. Edwards came to Cali
fornia some two years ago from Ari
zona, where Edwards was engaged ac
tively in railroad and other business in
terests. Feeling that they needed a rest,
they purchased a ranch home in the
Santa Cruz mountains. They are both
deeply interested in the welfare of Stan
ford University and intend to move to
Palo Alto and become actively engaged
in the interests of this community.
WILL DEVELOP PROPERTY
Construction work will begin immedi
ately 011 the 40 acres for the purpose of
placing the property in condition for a
high-class residence section. Gardner A.
Dailey of Stanford University, landscape
engineer, who is recognized as one of the
best in his profession, is working 011 the
landscaping, submitting plans for sub
dividing the property and offering some
thing most unique as a residential place.
The property will probably be known
as "College View Place."
All construction work and placing of
the property on the market will be
through the offices of M. T. Tichenor &
Co. of Palo Alto. Miss Sue Dyer, man
ager of the local department, reports j
many applications 011 file already for
home sites from parties who desire to
build and live within walking distance of
the University.

through the offices of M. T. Tichenor &
Co. of Palo Alto. Miss Sue Dyer, man
ager of the local department, reports j
many applications 011 file already for
home sites from parties who desire to
build and live within walking distance of
the University.
The famous "Stanford Field" of 40
acres, picturesquely located and bounded
by the State highway, Evergreen Park,
Alma street and Churchill avenue, has
been released by Stanford University
for home sites, it was announced today
at the office of M. H. Tichenor & Co. of
Palo Alto, who will have charge of the
marketing of the property. Papers are
being passed through the Tichenor office
conveying the field (lot 40 of the Stan
ford University land) to A. W. Edwards.
This field for some time has been a
part and parcel of the city of Palo Alto,
as the corporation boundaries extend
around the entire acreage.
Because of the extraordinary setting
which the property has, with its large
frontage 011 the main boulevard and
facing the university campus and the
foothills, with the fine residence section
of South Palo Alto and the artistic Union
High School buildings for a background,
this acreage lias been looked upon by
those seeking homes in this community
as a most desirable location, but hitherto
has been unavailable because of being
Stanford University property and not for
sale.
BENEFITS FORESEEN
The University trustees and Comp
troller A. E. Roth believe two great
things will be accomplished by releasing
this acreage: First, the proceeds from
the sale of the property will be more
beneficial to the University than holding
the land; second, the community will be
greatly benefited by having the property
utilized for residential purposes.
Mr. and Mrs. Edwards came to Cali
fornia some two years ago from Ari
zona, where Edwards was engaged ac
tively in railroad and other business in
terests. Feeling that they needed a rest,
they purchased a ranch home in the
Santa Cruz mountains. They are both
deeply interested in the welfare of Stan
ford University and intend to move to
Palo Alto and become actively engaged
in the interests of this community.
WILL DEVELOP PROPERTY
Construction work will begin immedi
ately 011 the 40 acres for the purpose of
placing the property in condition for a
high-class residence section. Gardner A.
Dailey of Stanford University, landscape
engineer, who is recognized as one of the
best in his profession, is working 011 the
landscaping, submitting plans for sub
dividing the property and offering some
thing most unique as a residential place.
The property will probably be known
as "College View Place."
All construction work and placing of
the property on the market will be
through the offices of M. T. Tichenor &
Co. of Palo Alto. Miss Sue Dyer, man
ager of the local department, reports j
