# WILBUR ADDRESS IS FEATURE OF STUDENT ASSEMBLY TUESDAY
## INSTITUTION TO GROW University President Says Stanford Students Are Always Same 
### 
Stanford has developed and will con
tinue to progress along lines of a uni
versity rather than a college, said
President Wilbur, speaking in assem
bly Tuesday morning. Wnli the aid
of the second million of the endowment
campaign expansion of several profes
sional departmnts will be allowed, and
it is possible, the President indicated,
that a school of business administra
tion will be organized.
The first million of the endowment
#
campaign has been raised through ap
peal to alumni of the University, Dr.
Wilbur stated. The present momen
tum of the campaign should bring in
funds to care for shrinkage in the first
million, and give a good start toward
the second million, for which a definite
campaign will be conducted in the fall.
It is to friends of the University rather
than alumni that Stanford will go for
the second million.
The junior colleges of California
have made rapid growth in the past
few years, and ai;e now taking care of
many students during their first years
of post-high-school s'udy, according to
the President. Registration at the
University of California met its first
decrease last year, because of the num
ber of students taking first year of
advanced work in junior colleges.
Commenting on the development of
character by students in universities,
Dr. Wilbur stated that he has subse
quently changed few opinions formed
of students while at .Stanford. "They
do not change much," said the Pres
ident.
