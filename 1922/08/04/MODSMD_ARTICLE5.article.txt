The summer quarter has proven a
definite success. Dr. Wilbur remarked
that when the summer school was first
started many believed only laggards
and students of poorer caliber would
find it wise to attend summer sessions.
The summer quarter has on the con
trary proved a success not only in num
ber of students enrolled, but in the at
titude and accomplishment of the
group of men and women who come for
summer study. This quarter includes
few of the students who are "sent" to
college, and more who come bcause
they are after what is given.
Following the address by President
Wilbur, Phil Landis, '23, President
elect of the Associated Students, acted
as chairman of a short program includ
ing talks by Lester Seib, *22, on dra
matics; Wylie Kilpatrick, '23, on atti
tude toward student life; and William
Leiser, '21, on traditions.
