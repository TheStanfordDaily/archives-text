# PROFESSOR J. LOMAX GIVES LECTURE ON 'NEGRO SPIRITUALS'
## 
### 
The vivid imagery and humOr charac
teristic of negro songs was illustrated in
Professor John A. Lomax's address
Tuesday evening in the Little Theater
on "Negro Spirituals."
Lomax is a native of Mississippi and
has spent many years in central Texas,
where the negroes greatly outnumber the
white population. It was in Texas that
he gathered his spirituals, as the re
ligions songs of the negro are called, in
distinction from his real or secular songs.
Heaven and hell, the devil, baptism,
death, and similar topics are the themes
of the negro's spirituals. Religion and
ethics are entirely separated in his mind
and his songs contain no mention of how
to lead a better life. Satan and hell are
visual entities, to be shunned with terror;
he speaks of God with the utmost fa
miliarity, and thinks of heaven as a place
of physical rest.
The negro's gift for highly colorel
phrases and apt colloquial expressions
enables him to translate the Bible stories
into interest-compelling songs. His
words fit precisely into the swinging
melodies he chooses and his keen sense
of the ridiculous never 'ails to bold the
hearer's attention. In t T ie negro cluircho>
a leader carries the burden of the sing
ing, the congregation joining in th<
chorus and singing the refrain motif. As
the race is highly emotional, their re
ligious services. *. rticularlv their bap
tisms, arc characterized by seizures of re
ligious ccstacy on the part of the wof
shipers.
Professor Lomax is a member of the
faculty of the University of Texas. He
was formerly Sheldon Fellow for the
investigation of American ballads at
Harvard, and was twice president of the
American Folk-Lore Society. He leo
tured on "Swng> "112 the Western ('< w
