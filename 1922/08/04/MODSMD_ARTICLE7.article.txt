# GORDON DAVIS, HELEN WHITNEY, AND LESTER SEIB WILL TAKE LEADING PARTS IN "TEA FOR THREE" TONIGHT
## CRITICS PRAISE MEGRUE PRODUCTION 
### 
"All my life I have known two kinds
of girls—those whom I loved and those
who loved men; and they were never
the same," is the conclusion reached
by Philip Collamore, clubman and
bachelor, in the play, "Tea for Three,"
Stanford Assembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock.
According to Current Opinion for De
cember, $918, "Tea for Three" is the
most brilliant American comedy since
Langdon Mitchell's "The New York
Idea." Roi Cooper Megrue in his play
has apparently thrown away all the
rules of playwrights, for he is not in
terested in action; but allows his char
acters to talk at will. The action and
plot are subsidiary. Witty and worldly
wise conversation from the mouths of
three human and perfectly plausible
characters sustain the interest of the
audience throughout the production.
The plot centers around an Ameri
can triangle, consisting of an American
wife, an American husband, and an
American friend. According to a noted

critic, Megrue "puts a new angle on
the triangle." New York surfeited
with triangles of European playwrights
thought this quite a huge contract,
when the play was first heralded, but
the initial performance convinced the
critics and the enthusiastic audience
that at last there was a play which
could take a situation so universally
appealing and make out of it a play
Which would delight all.
With sparkling and clever lines and
without milksop blindness, the drama
tist presents a human and truthful
crisis in the lives of three people. But
a greater feat than this is that he
brings them through it without vul
garity or questionable means.
Helen Whitney will take the only
woman's lead in the part of Doris, the
wife of a hardworking, loving, yet jeal
ous husband. Miss Whitney is well
known here for her ingenuous work in
the part of Dolly Glandon in the 1921
Sophomore play, "You Never Can Tell,"
and as one of the imps in this year's
Junior Opera. She surprised the fol
lowers of campus dramatics when she
proved her versatility by interpreting
the heavy and difficult role of Hugette
du Hamel in Justin McCarthy's his
toric drama, "If I Were King."
Gordon Davis, taking the role of the
jealous but loving husband, is too well
known to require an enumeration of
his accomplishments. It is not often
that a campus audience sees the dra
matic coach in action, for Davis rarely
takes time from coaching plays to take
an active part in them.
The part of the family friend, the
ironic, bachelor and general man about
town, Dr. Collamore, is taken by Les
ter Seib, who. during the past four
years has taken leads in many campus
productions and has directed several
junior operas and Ram's Head shows.
Ann Gardner Wayland, nee Ann
Gardner, '20, has been selected to take
the part of the maid. Mrs. Wayland
crowned her dramatic success while at.
Stanford when she took the lead in the
"Yellow Jacket," the English Club's
sensational play of 1921.
Austin, the devoted valet to Dr.
Collamore, will be characterized by
Dan Gage. Gage will be remembered
for his characterization of the English
solicitor, Mr. McComas, in "You N<iver
Can Tell.'-' He also played in the
"Yellow Jacket."
Chrysella Dunker will arrange the
settings and will have complete charge
of the stage.
Tickets are still obtainable at Cran
dall's in Palo Alto and at the Adminis
tration Office on the campus for sev
enty-five cents and one dollar.

crowned her dramatic success while at.
Stanford when she took the lead in the
"Yellow Jacket," the English Club's
sensational play of 1921.
Austin, the devoted valet to Dr.
Collamore, will be characterized by
Dan Gage. Gage will be remembered
for his characterization of the English
solicitor, Mr. McComas, in "You N<iver
Can Tell.'-' He also played in the
"Yellow Jacket."
Chrysella Dunker will arrange the

"All my life I have known two kinds
of girls—those whom I loved and those
who loved men; and they were never
the same," is the conclusion reached
by Philip Collamore, clubman and
bachelor, in the play, "Tea for Three,"
Stanford Assembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock.
According to Current Opinion for De
cember, $918, "Tea for Three" is the
most brilliant American comedy since
Langdon Mitchell's "The New York
Idea." Roi Cooper Megrue in his play
has apparently thrown away all the
rules of playwrights, for he is not in
terested in action; but allows his char
acters to talk at will. The action and
plot are subsidiary. Witty and worldly
wise conversation from the mouths of
three human and perfectly plausible
characters sustain the interest of the
audience throughout the production.
The plot centers around an Ameri
can triangle, consisting of an American
wife, an American husband, and an
American friend. According to a noted

critic, Megrue "puts a new angle on
the triangle." New York surfeited
with triangles of European playwrights
thought this quite a huge contract,
when the play was first heralded, but
the initial performance convinced the
critics and the enthusiastic audience
that at last there was a play which
could take a situation so universally
appealing and make out of it a play
Which would delight all.
With sparkling and clever lines and
without milksop blindness, the drama
tist presents a human and truthful
crisis in the lives of three people. But
a greater feat than this is that he
brings them through it without vul
garity or questionable means.
Helen Whitney will take the only
woman's lead in the part of Doris, the
wife of a hardworking, loving, yet jeal
ous husband. Miss Whitney is well
known here for her ingenuous work in
the part of Dolly Glandon in the 1921
Sophomore play, "You Never Can Tell,"
and as one of the imps in this year's
Junior Opera. She surprised the fol
lowers of campus dramatics when she
proved her versatility by interpreting
the heavy and difficult role of Hugette
du Hamel in Justin McCarthy's his
toric drama, "If I Were King."
Gordon Davis, taking the role of the
jealous but loving husband, is too well
known to require an enumeration of
his accomplishments. It is not often
that a campus audience sees the dra
matic coach in action, for Davis rarely
takes time from coaching plays to take
an active part in them.
The part of the family friend, the
ironic, bachelor and general man about
town, Dr. Collamore, is taken by Les
ter Seib, who. during the past four
years has taken leads in many campus
productions and has directed several
junior operas and Ram's Head shows.
Ann Gardner Wayland, nee Ann
Gardner, '20, has been selected to take
the part of the maid. Mrs. Wayland
