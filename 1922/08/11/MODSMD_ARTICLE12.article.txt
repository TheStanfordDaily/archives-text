# "TEA FOR THREE" IS KNOCKOUT, DECLARES CRITIC IN REVIEW
## CAST KNEW ITS STUFF Authority Gives Angle on Triangle in Article on Comedy 
### A CRABB SALAD 
Folks, it was a knock-out; not be
cause of scenic effects, for they were
few; not because of unheard-of situa
tions, for there were none; not because
of musical accompaniments, because
the musicians never but
because this Davis, Seib. Whitney com
bination knows how to stage and in
terpret a play. Davis went through all
the stages from passive to active as the
mildly irritated husband to the wildly
jealous. The only time any portion of
the campus has seen him so aroused
has been during particularly trying
moments in coaching plays in which
he had no part. Seib, suave and blase,
in order to prove that his trip to the
Orient was based on merit, was a very
convincing villain in the shape of a
family-friend wedge. Helen Whitney
gave all husbands present a hunch
which caused them all to smile on their
wives with great fervor for fear of los
ing them But then, all the complica
tions of "Tea For Three" were no doubt
familiar ground to married men. They
merely saw somebody else getting it in
the neck.
Dan Gage, valiant valet, and Ann
Gardiner, tearful maid, watched from
the wings while the triangle made efforts
to change corners, dnd when great
difficulties presented themselves these re
maining members of the cast undid var
ious tangles peculiar to plays in which the
topography of the three-cornered fig
ure tries to alter itself.
When the curtain rose on the delight
ful domestic scene of tea for two,
showing the wife and her old flame in
dulging in this delicacy at a respectable
place, the audience was treated to a
harmonous melody by the Heavenly
Hashers entitled,"Hark, How the Angels
Sling.'' As the last note of the invisible
orchestra died away, the flame en
deavored to scorch the wings of the
moth with words of love and event
ually the two laid an innocent plot
whereby the two might see each other
frequently without further inciting the
husband's jealousy. The lady, divided
between loyalty and love for her hus
band and compassion and love for the re
jected suitor, was a willing partner to
this scheme in which she saw herself
admired by two amorous parties.
During tea for three that evening at the
home of the wife, remarks let fall by
the suitor, who has called in accordance
with the scheme, are construed in no
flattering sense by the outraged hus
band. It becomes evident that little de
votion is wasted between these two,al
though they lavish many looks of extreme
affection upon the hostess, who between
sugaring tea and returing glances is as
busy as a hen in a wheat bin. The un
guarded remarks of the rival continue to
annoy the husband until as a pretext to
rid himself of the pest momentarily he
goes to the telephone. The old flame
with his usual powers of preception sen
ses that his presence is not necessary to
the good health of the husband, and
after stealing a photograph of the fair
lady in question, he departs, leaving be
hind the foundation for an excellent
domestic duel.
The husband learns of the afternoon
meeting, observ-es the absence of the
photograph, and full of more suspicion
than tea, for he has partaken sparingly
under the fire of his rival, charges the
rooms of his departed caller under the
pretext of "merely dropping in."
The rival meanwhile has hidden the
photograph, and has prepared to meet
a lady caller. His desk is decorated with
yellow roses, said to be the favorite
flower of the lady in question. The hus
band takes all this in at a glance, and
since this is also the bloom of his law
fully wedded wife and he is forced to
wait until the caller goes into another
room before he is permitted to leave,
his rage knows no bounds. Leaving in
his wake a rarified atmosphere, he
stations himself in a position below and
awaits developments.
As is to be expected, his wife then en
ters and is filled with misgivings to learn
that her enraged squire is pacing the
bricks outside. She has called presum
ably to take back the picture which has
caused so much trouble, but existing
circumstances do not permit her depart
ure and the obstinate lover declares that
the return of the photograph will do no
good.
After a while the suspicious spouse can
contain himself no longer, and falling
upon the door with great ire, calls upon

the home-breaker for admission. The
valet then informs the trapped parties
that the "tailor has come to fit a suit."
As a matter of fact, the indignant hus
band is having a fit that should suit any
body, and as he charges down the hall,
his wife escapes through another room
and hies herself homeward.
After confronting the suave rival with
all his calumnious deeds, the irate hus
band, fairly flying about with fury, chal
lenges him to a self-killing duel, a mod
ern invention known only to the best
comedies. They are to draw cards from
a hat, the winner to win the wife, the
loser to lose his life. After a heated
discussion, during which the suitor sniffs
at the idea, the husband has his wish
and succeeds in winning his own wife.
The rival is to die by his own hand
within twenty-four hours. He declares,
however, that lie will steal the wife be
fore he dies. Greatly disturbed by this
threat, the husband takes himself home,
where he guards the treasure of his
hearth with so much zeal that she cannot
sneeze without giving the gentleman
heart trouble.
An evening paper laid on the steps an

hour or two before the unfortunate
rival's demise was to have occurred, an
nounces the suicide of that gentleman.
The husband is aghast, the maid weeps,
the butler, not being present, probably
groans in the wings, the wife raves, and
several kinds of particular deviltry is
raised. The wife declares that some
thing is gone out of her life, that she had
loved the deceased, that the husband is
a person of a very low order of intelli
gence, all of which causes a great light to
break upon the jealous one. He sees now
what the rival meant by saying lie would
steal his wife. While the befuddled hus
band is groaning in his chair and the
wife is tearfully denouncing the plot, the
rival walks in, much pleased at beholding
the lachrymal glands in such good trim.
The husband is so delighted on seeing
the rival restored to life again that he
begs him to call thereafter at least six
times a day and to take care of his wife
while he, himself, is taking in a pleasure
and rest resort.
While the husband is out looking for
a corkscrew, it becomes evident that the
entire incident is the result of a plot be
tween wife and rival. The paper an
nouncing the suicide was the only one
of its kind in captivity, having been
especially printed for the occasion. The
wife had not been informed of this fact
and was consequently in a bad way when
the news arrived. Cut this particular
play being a comedy and a good one at
that, everybody cries, but nobody dies,
thus assuring the audience that at the
finishing posts everybody will be guar
anteed of a happy ever after, even to the
maid with the well-trained tear glands
and the butler with the code announce
ments and acute sense of discretion.
