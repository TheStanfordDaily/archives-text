# "TEA FOR THREE" IS KNOCKOUT, DECLARES CRITIC IN REVIEW
## CAST KNEW ITS STUFF Authority Gives Angle on Triangle in Article on Comedy 
### A CRABB SALAD 
Folks, it was a knock-out; not be
cause of scenic effects, for they were
few; not because of unheard-of situa
tions, for there were none; not because
of musical accompaniments, because
the musicians never but
because this Davis, Seib. Whitney com
bination knows how to stage and in
terpret a play. Davis went through all
the stages from passive to active as the
mildly irritated husband to the wildly
jealous. The only time any portion of
the campus has seen him so aroused
has been during particularly trying
moments in coaching plays in which
he had no part. Seib, suave and blase,
in order to prove that his trip to the
Orient was based on merit, was a very
convincing villain in the shape of a
family-friend wedge. Helen Whitney
gave all husbands present a hunch
which caused them all to smile on their

showing the wife and her old flame in
dulging in this delicacy at a respectable
place, the audience was treated to a
harmonous melody by the Heavenly
Hashers entitled,"Hark, How the Angels
Sling.'' As the last note of the invisible
orchestra died away, the flame en
deavored to scorch the wings of the
moth with words of love and event
ually the two laid an innocent plot
whereby the two might see each other
frequently without further inciting the
husband's jealousy. The lady, divided
between loyalty and love for her hus
band and compassion and love for the re
jected suitor, was a willing partner to
this scheme in which she saw herself
admired by two amorous parties.
During tea for three that evening at the
home of the wife, remarks let fall by
the suitor, who has called in accordance
with the scheme, are construed in no
flattering sense by the outraged hus
band. It becomes evident that little de
