# THE 						PESTERED ADVERTISER
## 
### 
Stanford students have prided themselves in the past on their ability
to support five undergraduate publications, including the Quad, not to
mention the alumni magazine. They have pointed it out to their friends
as an achievement to be extolled to the skies, forgetting that it is to the
advertiser they owe the life of most of their publications.
It may be taken for granted that it is a fine thing to know that enough
editorial talent exists on the campus to permit the issue of these student
magazines and papers, but when it comes to actual financial support, the
undergraduate is simply not there. Three-fourths of the time, he is not
a subscriber, and two-thirds of the time he is not even a reader. Yet he is
proud to let people know that six editors hold jobs at Stanford.
And the advertiser? Is lie proud of the existing state of' affairs?
Does he rejoice because journalism is so extensive on the campus? Does
lie eagerly hasten to bestow a contract 011 every advertising representative
from Stanford? Reconcile yourself to a negative answer. ITe does not.
and moreover, he cannot afford it. Duplication and overlapping never
bought an advertiser a new pair of shoes.
To correct this situation is not so easy as to deplore it. To diminish
the number of editors is a considerable task, while to put an advertising
manager or so out of a job is to upset the universe. It is common knowl
edge to the advertiser that every campus publication is a better medium
than any of the others. He has been assured of this fact by personal rep
resentatives of each. No doubt his contracts would greatly fatten his
purse if this were possible, but he is evidently inclined to doubt these
grave pronouncements. Under such circumstances there must be com
petition.
Competition may be the life of business, but in a case such as this, it
is either death or discrimination for the advertiser. As a consequence,
the campus agent with the most convincing story, whether it is at the
expense of another publication or not, secures the advertiser's business.
The eventual result is that the advertiser begins to think that all campus
agents are liars of the first order, for which suspicion he seems to have
some ground, and determines to curtail business with them.
The solution is self-evident. Either some student publication must die
a natural death or some two must combine. Past experience has taught
the campus that dead publications are in the habit of sneaking out of their
coffins for the puri>ose of haunting their competitors under another name.
You can't kill 'em.
The other horn of the dilemma is also likely to impale reform. Ardent
supporters of "literary efforts" are equally ardent in their dislike for
"student opinion" publications, in which the latter heartily reciprocates.
The love lost between the two is of a negligible quantity. And yet, if
s cither desires'continued prosperity, it must reconcile itself to closer asso
ciation with the other. A combination spells their mutual salvation.
There is no reason why both types of journalistic work cannot be printed
within the same cover.
The name, of course, could never favor either faction. The names of
both publications supported by the factions in question cover a multitude
of sins. In order to avoid the questionable connotation, then, which each
side points out for the other, the death of these two publications might be
sustained without too much grief by the campus if it resulted in the birth
cf "The Stanford Compromise."
