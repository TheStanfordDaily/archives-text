May we voice our humble opinion that few artists of our cognizance
could have provided a more pleasurable evening than Gordon Davis,
Helen Whitney, and Lester Seib, in "Tea. for Three," laÂ§t Friday.
Davis, always correct in his lines, characterization, and technique, was
the perfect "narrow-minded" husband. Blase, irresponsible, attractive,
Scib, as the wife's friend of long standing, showed clearly the charac
teristics making him Stanford's greatest student actor.
No end of delight was afforded the audience when Miss Helen Whit
ney. in a panic induced at the coming of her husband when she was
visiting Seib at his rooms, was forced to effect a somewhat speedy and
immensely perturbed exit. Her characterization here was far above the
capabilities of the ordinary student actress. Miss Whitney was immedi
ately forgiven when she temporarily forgot her lines at the close of the
act. an incident which only served to emphasize the truly professional
manner in which the work of the trio had been presented.
The play was properly received, by a large summer crowd. Above
all, in its main purj>ose, in providing enjoyment for those who came, it
was thoroughly successful.
