Hello! Hello! This is SCRS broad
casting station. Hello! This is SCRS.
The first novelty on the evening's pro
gram is a ukelele concert by the Eu
calyptus Brothers entitled, "Euxine
Euphony," or "Euchered by Ukiah."
None of the players has any strings
on his instrument.

The next number on the program
will be a solo by M. T. Pockets en
titled, "Put on Your Sunday Manners,
There's a Party on the Line." The
encore will be, "I Took a Walk Around
the House Followed by My Breakfast."

The next number is a novelty never
tried before by radio. Tom O. Hawk,
famous fencing expert, will give a les
son in the art of sword duelling. By
following my count you will be able to
follow the fancy maneuvers of this
famous bird. Receivers will clamp
their instrument to their heads and as
sume the following postures: . . .
Are you ready? . .. At the count of
1 advance the right foot and hook the
left thumb in the back of the belt. If
you have no belt, use the little finger.
One! At the count of 2 seize a nearby
hatpin or billiard cue in the right hand
and raise it to the level of the eyes,
meanwhile wiggling the left ear to re
tain balance. Two! At the count of
3 take your elbow out of your vest
pocket and leap lightly into the air.
Retain this position until the next
count. Three! At the count of 4 flap
your ears together at the back of the
head and bark like a biscuit. Change
hands and feet and assume position
of Roman gladiator stabbing a lion
with a petrified fromage. Four! If
you have had no difficulty in perform
ing these simple exercises, prepare for
the count of 5, at which you bend back
till the chin touches the heels. Lift
both feet slowly, but be careful not to
let the head touch the ground. Main
tain the heel-chin contact, wrap your
arms around your ankles so that the
thumbs touch the nose. Agitate the
fingers gently. Five! At the count of
6 snap back to the standing position
and remove your arctics and overcoat.
Six! At the count of 7 put the right
foot over your head and hold it down
with the left. With the left hand

crank the phonograph and advance
upon your adversary, stabbing at him
with your weapon. If necessary em
ploy the right hand in this movement.
Under no circumstances use the other
hand. Seven! At the count of 8 go
through all the other seven counts with
as much rapidity as possible, thus sur
prising your adversary with your agili
ty. Eight! At the count of 9 put the
palm of your right hand on the floor
and wrap the left leg about a chande
lier. Take off your right shoe and
throw it at your adversary. If he ob
jects to this, stick out the tongue of
the other shoe at him, and without
moving, dust off the Baby Grand with
his nose. Nine! At the count of 10
instructions cease. If you're not out,
the referee will put you out.
