# VISITING ORGANIST TREATS LOVERS OF MUSIC IN PROGRAM
## E. Harold Geer of Vassar Gives Tuesday Recital in Memorial Church 
### 
Dignity coupled with delicacy of touch
characterized the playing of E. Harold
Geer in his organ recital last Tuesday
evening in the Memorial Church.
Geer, like Warren D. Allen, University
organist, is a pupil of the French master,
Widor, and shows a preference for the
French school of organ music. His best
interpreted number was the Widor Canti
lene from the "Symphonie Romane." In
this he displayed the delicacy and versa
tility of mood, free from any suggestion
of trick playing, characteristic of his
work.
The same charm and lightness were
manifested in Yon's "Humoresque,
L'Organo Primitivo," in Lenorman's
"Trois Pieces Breves," and in the two
scherzosâ€”Guilmant's from the Fifth
Sonata and Vierne's "Scherzetto."' "Le
Petit Berger," from the Children's Cor
ner by Debussey was well adapted to the
organist's refinement of manner, a cer
tain whimsical quality cropping out that
is not usually thought possible of at
tainment on a pipe organ.
Because of the limitations of the Stan
ford organ, the famous "Liebestod" from
"Tristan and Isolde," was less success
ful. However, it added the needed
weight to the program and met the tastes
of the classicists in the audience. Bach,
also, in an A minor prelude and fugue,
appeared as a representative of the class
ical school.
Geer left for Claremont Wednesday,
where he will visit his mother before
returning north to give two concerts in
the Civic Auditorium, one next Sunday
and one the following week. After these
recitals he will leave for the East.
