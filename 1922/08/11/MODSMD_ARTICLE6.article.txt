# COAST CONFERENCE TO LAY PLANS FOR EAST-WEST CONTEST
## FLETCHER, BARROW GO College Representatives Will Meet in Berkeley for Confab 
### 
Plans for the East vs. West game at
Pasadena New Year's day and questions
of eligibility will come up for discussion
at the meeting of the faculty representa
tives from the colleges and universities
of the Pacific Coast Conference, which
will be held in Berkeley today and to
morrow.
Dr. W. H. Barrow, successor to Dr. A.
D. Browne as assistant professor of
physical education, is Stanford's repre
sentative on the conference. He and W.
D. Fletcher, graduate manager, will go
to Berkeley to be present at the sessions.
Professor John U. Calkins of the Uni
versity of California, also newly ap
pointed, and W. R. Le Porte of the Uni
versity of Southern California, which
was recently admitted to the conference,
are California's other representatives.
As all three will take part in the discus
sions for the first time, this state will be
at a slight disadvantage. Other mem
bers of the conference are Dupont of
Oregon Agricultural College, Ayres of
the University of Washington, Howe of
the University of Oregon, Carpenter of
Washington State, and a faculty mem
ber from the University of Idaho. Grad
uate managers from the other institu
tions will be in attendance unofficially.
A delegate from the Tournament of
Roses committee of Pasadena will also
attend.
The question of signing an agreement
with the Pasadena organization for the
holding of the East-West game annually
in the Tournament of Roses stadium
will be taken up. Changes in eligibility
fequirements will also be among the
matters discussed.

It is possible that the conference will
make arrangements for the designation
of an official "champion" eleven among
the member teams at the close of the
season. This is advocated for the pur
pose of relieving the press experts of the
great task in years when there - is no out
standing team as was California's outfit
last fall.
The official designation of a cham
pionship team is also advocated by those
who wish the conference to lend official
aid to the Tournament of Roses game
each year. The Tournament of Roses
committee wishes to secure the partici
pation of the admitted coast champion
ship team against a representative east
ern team each year.
