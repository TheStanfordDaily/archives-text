# ADVERTISING CLUB MEETS TO CONSIDER BUSINESS PROGRAM
## 
### 
"Standardize space-selling methods of
campus publications and work for the
best interests of the advertiser," are the
aims of the Stanford Ad Club, which met
at a dinner held Monday evening at Joe's
Place to consider next year's business
program.
According to the president, William R.
Gage, the club passed two resolutions:
(1) that the soliciting and selling of
space in programs and other non jour
nalistic mediums should be prohibited,
and (2) that no new publications should
be created. These resolutions will be pre
sented to the executive committee of the
Student Body for its consideration when
it convenes in October.
It will also be the endeavor of the club
to have the executive committee turn
over to the Ad Club all matters relative
to advertising for their investigation and
valuation.
Another important matter taken up
was the club's educational program. Paul
H. Clyde, chairman of the education
committee, according to the plans adopt
ed, will supervise a laboratory course in
advertising, which will have as its ob
ject the standardization of space-selling
methods for local campus media. The
club is trying to obtain University credit
for such work. Only those actively en
gaged in soliciting advertising will be
eligible to enroll in the course.
President Cage made a suggestion,
which was later adopted, to acquaint the
Palo Alto merchants of the work that is
being done by the club in their interest.
Through such helpful co-operation the
club hopes to eliminate certain noxious
conditions that appeared last year.
Those present at the meeting were J.
E. McDowell, Paul H. Clyde, Howard
Pease, Lee Sandberg, Jack Young, W. R.
Gage, Don McQueen, Warren Lewis,
Wylic Kilpatrick and Tom Faucette.
