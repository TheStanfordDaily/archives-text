# Palo Altan Gives Coin Collection to Department
## 
### 
H. W. Dunlop of Palo Alto has pre
sented to the Department of Classical
Literature, through Charles Marx, a col
lection of early Greek and Roman coins.
Dunlop found these coins in the little
village of Uschak, Anatolia, when he
was returning from Turkey after the
armistice. Anatolia, according to Dun
lop, is probably the last known and most
fertile field for antiquarians today. The
coins, about fifty in number, bear in
scriptions showing them to have been
made during the reign of one of the
Ptolemies. Dr. Fairclough. head of the
Department of Classical Literature, has
not yet classified the coins.
