###

time to arrive on the campus September
1, when he will take in hand preliminary
preparations for gridiron work which by
conference rules starts with practice Sep
tember 15.

of Center College, will arrive from Los
Angeles, where he now lives, about Sep

Stadium Not Offered for New Year's
Game
Conflicting reports have been made
public concerning occurrences at a con
ference meeting of representatives of
Coast Conference colleges held at Berke
ley last week.
Contrary to some statements, the Stan
ford representatives made no objections
to the playing of the coming New Year's
game at Pasadena. The Stanford
stadium was not offered for the New
Year's game.
Everything in Shape for Fall
Football
Andrew Kerr will find everything in
readiness for a strenuous football season.
The stadium turf has been carefully
tended since the staging of the opera
there last June, and will present a
smooth, firm surface for the games this
season.
An extra practice turf is provided in
the old playing field, and another may be
used by Kerr if necessary. The fresh
man practice turf has been fenced in,
and it also is in good shape. It is pos
sible that Kerr may use this for the regu
lar varsity workouts.
Captain Dudley DeGroot is expected
before the first of September.
According to all reports, football on
the Pacific Coast will enjoy its biggest
year to date. Practically every confer
ence member is making extra efforts to
place first class teams in the field. Sport
ing departments of practically all papers,
anticipating the great football interest
this year, are making arrangements to
cover the sport on a much more elaborate
basis than previously.
Graduate Manager Fletcher states that
pre-season interest in the Big Game is
greater at this time than he has ever
known it to be this early in the season.
Already applications for Big Game seats
are being received, and quite a number
of them en bloc, as that of the Mare
Island Marines, whose athletic organiza
tion has already applied for a block of
thirty seats.
