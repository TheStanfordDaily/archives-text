# LITTLE FIRE YET
## 
### 
While there has been a great deal of smoke concerning the coming
football season, there is as yet little real dope on it, other than what every
one has known since last spring.
The conference at Berkeley has been quite misrepresented in some
quarters, as regards the stand taken bv Stanford toward the coming New
Year's game. Stanford made no objection whatever to the playing of
the coming game at Pasadena. Nor does Stanford have any desire to
have that game played in her own Stadium, by any other than her own
team. The Stanford Stadium was not offered for the game New Year's
day.
Concerning incoming freshmen, the advance dope is always wholly
unreliable. Last year we never knew there was going to be a freshman
team, yet more stars showed up than during any years of history. This
year, as usual, the advance dope will be all wrong. Stars announced as
going to one university will be found in another, and may be found also
not to be stars in the first place. Stanford has always stood for develop
ment of the athlete, and it is very probable that as usual, Stanford,
through Coach Hunt, will develop his biggest freshmen stars from men
who are now unknown. As far as stars go, advance dope credits us with
as many as it does anyone else: but the point is, don't go by the dope,
and you will not be disappointed. Dope is never correct. There will be
no real information on the Stanford freshmen until Coach Hunt has a
squad in charge for a couple of weeks. Then, a little study will tell
something of what he may have. As yet there is little but smoke.
