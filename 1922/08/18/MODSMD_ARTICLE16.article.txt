Great would be the consternation of the "red-blooded" men of old
should they see today tourists of various foreign and domestic extraction
from the "rubber-neck" wagons rambling down the corridors of the Quad
and even into the Memorial Church with cigars, meerschaums, or Bull
Durham protruding from their upper physiognamies. If this is objec
tionable to you, why not inform the next party of such composition that
passes you that smoking isn't for the Quad. It might be well to ask the
head officers of the tourists' transportation companies to inform their
drivers and "salve spreaders" of our one or two inviolable customs, with
which they would undoubtedly be glad to conform.
The senior bench has become a great depot for summer picnics and
various luncheon parties. This bench, which has a plate naming it as the
gift of '21 upon it. is opposite the Economics steps, and underclassmen
on the campus, and others as well, could harm no one while making the
rest of us feel immeasureably better, if they would on all occasions inform
any but seniors or holdovers of Stanford that the bench is for use of
latter classes only.
We have no desire to prohibit visitors from seeing the campus, but
during times when there are so many of them, and few old students are
here, unless those who do know keep themselves busy warning
intruders, every custom of the Farm for the time being may as well be
suspended. Of course, not every summer student knows all the traditions,
and this is not necessary, but such time honored rules as no smoking on
the Quad, and the sacredness of the senior bench, should not be so dis
honored.
