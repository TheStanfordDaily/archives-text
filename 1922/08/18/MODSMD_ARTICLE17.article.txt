# CABBAGES and THINGS

Since the call of the wild has taken so
many of our best citizens to the back
woods, including old man Gump and
"Dink" Templeton, our chief versifica
tor, whom we hold in high regard, has
achieved the following indignity to the
English language:
Vile Bird!
Thou flying nightmare,
Thou evil omen of the slough,
Begone!
I love thee not,
Cruel parasite.
Thou makest me to lie
In greenest pastures dozen,
IVhere thou anointest me
With thy base prong,
And shrilly hum
A naughty tune.
I
Base Bug!
Music hath charms
But thine hast none,
Therefore no music;
Sweet Shades of rest!
Where art thou gone?
Hast harkened to the gruesome
hum
Of yon blood sot?
Satan take thee,
Wretched beast!
Winged Vampire!
Get thee hence!
Out, damned sot!
Avaunt!
Thy bite is more
Than mortal man can bear;
Oh, Death!
IVhere is thy sting
Compared to this?
Holy Snakes!
I am a goner.
Impish Insect!
Thou fleest not

Before the smudge;
Before thee, Fiend,
I fly in torment;
How I long to smite
And kill!
Spat!
Ah, I have thee,
Thou art claimed by Hades!
But alas!
Here comes another
Damned mosquiter.

In these days of the coal strike some
people knock wood, but most of them
knock the price of it.

Rumor has it that Kallam got pinched
for speeding somewhere around Waikiki.
We always knew Kal had a fast one, but
zre never suspected him of this.

We quit. Another strike. Set 'em up
in the other alley.
