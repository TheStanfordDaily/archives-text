# VASTLY IMPORTANT ISSUES

### 
Hiram Johnson, the Abraham Lincoln of the present genera
tion, if you believe his supporters, is stumping - the state neither
"explaining nor apologizing/' but shouting Americanism to the
voters of California whom lie expects to retifrn him to the senate.
Can you imagine Abraham Lincoln waving his arms in the great
Johnson fighting mood and vociferously proclaiming his "Ameri
canism" in justification of his any and all acts? Do you remember
of Lincoln ever telling the people he was "American"? It was
hardly necessary. When great leaders of our country are Ameri
can at heart, we usually know of it, for we judge it from their
work; but when politicians find it necessary to continually flaunt
their "Americanism" in our faces—well, we sometimes wonder.
And most curiously, the best campaign point Johnson can find
to bolster up the intermissions between shouts of Americanism, he
had to dig up from a gubernatorial campaign of years ago. What
is the matter, hasn't he done anything since then? If he wants to
be governor again, well and good: but if this is a senatorial cam
paign, let's hear something about the conduct of that office.
The same old gang. Johnson goes on "fighting" it despite its
chief component parts are now his strongest supporters, and
despite also that many men who were responsible for his licking
the old gang years ago, now support another man for senator.
Quite apparently, the old gang is changed, the supporters on dif
ferent sides, and the issues much greater, but Johnson still hands
out the same old "line."
The issues of this campaign are made ridiculous. Johnson
won't answer questions, nor talk on anything material. He insists
on making the campaign entirely personal, despite such men as
Chester Rowell point out the real questions involved. If he
wants it personal, look at the campaign that way, and what is Mr.
Johnson? Is he ati Abraham Lincoln? Do his qualities of Ameri
canism distinguish him from thousands of other Californians ; and
if not, what claim has he to the office?
"The campaign against Johnson is purely personal—one of dis
like for. the man," we have been told. It is personal, in that John
son will make no other kind of campaign now ; but does the general
public accredit emphatic moves such as those of Rowell to hate of
the man Johnson? Rowell has been a good friend of Johnson: he
still is, though he is Johnson's strongest opponent in the present
race. Read Rowell if you want the real meat of the campaign, then
read or hear Johnson, and ask yourself if the man can be serious in
the stuff that he utters.
And for a tribute to Johnson, they go to a complimentary
speech of the Vice President's, in which he mentions by name Cali
fornia's chief representatives in the national government. Coolidge
would have said the same thing about you or me. were either of us
in Johnson's office. And if you read Coolidge's speech, he paid a
far greater compliment to one Herbert I loover, a plain business
man, an engineer, now in government administration for the first
time. Mr. Moore is the same type of citizen, a plain business man,
an engineer, who has been induced to enter the kind of a campaign
Johnson will always mako of this sort of thing.
It wasn't necessary to get one of these "tried" |x>liticians to
protect otir interests in the cabinet. And Moore can be made the
same type of public servant in the senate that Hoover is in the
cabinet. He is the same sort of man. And lie knows enough of
business, and about business, to protect California business men
as well as any candidate.
