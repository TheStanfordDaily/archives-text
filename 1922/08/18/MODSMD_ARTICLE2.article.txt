# EVOLUTION CALLED MAGNIFICENT BY DR. JORDAN IN LECTURE
## 
### 
Although Balfour cynically defined
evolution as a disreputable episode on
one of the minor planets, Dr. Jordan, in
his lecture Wednesday afternoon in the
Little Theater, called evolution the most
magnificent thing conceivable.
Dr. Jordan described early man's point
of view, which was to accept without
question life as it existed; the modern
scientific attitude toward the world be
gan only after man started keeping rec
ords and histories. Scientists do not
know how life began on the earth, but
geology proves that it started a tremen
dously long time ago. A V-shaped por
tion of land of which Montreal is the
point was the first part of the earth to
emerge from the water and stay out. In
the mountains of northern New York,
animals of very low structure have been
found, but these were not the first forms
of life, which were too small to leave
any traces. The fundamental unity of
the forms of life excludes the probability
of the theory that life arose spontaneous
ly, Dr. Jordan believes. At time passed,
the early forms became specialized into
plants and animals. With the conjunc
tion of cells the development of organs
with separate functions began. While
believing that every living thing must
run a gauntlet in its struggle for exist
ence, Dr. Jordan said that altruism be
gan with the conjunction of cells and
this altruism reaches its highest develop
ment in the love of the mother for her
child and of man and woman.
Bi-lateral symmetry and the forming
of a brain are the two most important
big stages in evolution. Starfish, sea
urchins, and similar low forms of life do
not have this bi-lateral symmetry which
is characteristic of higher forms.
To give an idea of the relative size of
the earth in comparison with other
planets, Dr. Jordan said that if one could
imagine the eartli to be the size of a
plum located in the Little Theater, the
moon would be a pea in one of the ad
jacent buildings, the sun a huge ball
near Eneina, and the nearest star would
be in Los Angeles.
The second of Dr. Jordan's lectures on
"Evolution"' will be given next Wednes
day afternoon in the Little Theater at
4:15 o'clock.
