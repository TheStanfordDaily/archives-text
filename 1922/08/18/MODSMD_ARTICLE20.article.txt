# PHYSICAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT CHANGES GYMNASIUM OFFICES
## 
### 
Graduate Manager William Fletcher
and Director Barrow are this month
making various alterations in the gym
nasium office system that will materially
change the internal appearance of the
building. Fletcher has .sought larger
and better quarters in new offices con
structed in what has heretofore been the
connection hall between the outer corri
dor and the gymnasium floor proper at
the west end of the building. The east
hall only will be used hereafter.
Four more new dressing rooms for
visiting teams are provided in the quar
ters just vacated by Fletcher. At times,
in spring particularly, the visiting quar
ters have been a bit crowded when visit
ing varsity and freshmen teams in sev
eral sports require rooms for six or eight
teams at one time.
The gymnasium store, towel exchange,
etc., has been moved out of the east
locker room to larger accommodations in
the central portion of the north wing,
just opposite the physical director's of
fice. The store takes one-third the space
of a former large lecture hall. The space
vacated by the store will be used for ad
ditional lockers, as will that of the re
maining portion of the old lecture room.
