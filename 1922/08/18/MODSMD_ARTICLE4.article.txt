# JAMES DAVIES BEATS FRENCH TENNIS STAR IN DIFFICULT MATCH
## Stanford Net Men Show to Advantage in Eastern Tournament 
### 
James Davies, '22, veteran Stanford
tennis star and joint holder of the na
tional intercollegiate doubles title, Tues
day attracted wide attention in the tour
nament world in defeating Andre Gobert,
star of the French Davis cup team, in a
prolonged uphill match.
Davies lost to the French star 6-love
in the first set before he knew what it
was all about. But he had been studying
his opponent's work, and finally got into
his stride in the second set, in the end
taking it 11-9, and wearing down Gobert
so heavily that he could take but one
game of the third. *
Phil Neer, who has been out of the
game for several weeks with an injured
knee, made a reappearance, though with
a slight limp, and came through the first
round, to be eliminated in the second.
Richard Hinkley, youngest member of
the Stanford trio, was defeated in the
opener.
