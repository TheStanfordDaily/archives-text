# SPEAKER DESCRIBES FOUNDING TRIALS OF ALBERTA UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
Trials and adventures not unlike Stan
ford's early days marked the founding
of the University of Alberta, declared
Professor E. K. Broadus, who lectured
Tuesday evening in the Little Theater
on "Pioneer Days in a Canadian Fat-
Western University."
At the time Alberta University was
founded fourteen years ago, the
created province of Alberta was sparsely
populated and the prospects were not
promising to the four men composing the
faculty of the university-to-be. "Twenty
years too early," was the verdict of the
wiseacres who could not visualize a uni
versity on the edge of a wilderness. The
one railroad into this most northerly
town in Alberta was the only link be
tween civilization and the primitive life
of the newly opened northwest.
Russians, Litlnicnians, English, Scotch,
and Americans were some of the na
tionalities represented in the unpromising
population. The university opened with
forty studentsâ€”and the faculty of four
men found time to go about the country
giving "extension lectures." But interest
was soon aroused in the settlers and to
day Alberta has 1300 students and 100
men in the faculty.
Dr. Broadus described the picturesque
country of the Saskatchewan River when
trappers, gold seekers, and the Royal
Northwest Mounted Police added color
and a flavor of romance to everyday life.
The town, Edmonton, grew rapidly, how
ever, and the time came when the arrival
of the daily train was no longer an event
of prime importance.
California universities, Dr. Broadus
believes, arc too self-centered. Alberta,
with natural interests in both the
United States and England, maintains
p. breadth of thought lacking in Cali
fornia institutions,
