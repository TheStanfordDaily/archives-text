# SPYING DENOUNCED BY DR. R.C. CABOT IN MONDAY LECTURE
## DESTROYS CONFIDENCE Modern Espionage Declared Justifiable Under Some Conditions 
### 
"Spying is one form of disloyalty to
agreements and ethics admits of no ne
cessity for the breaking of this conti
dence by which we live." This was Dr.
Richard C. Cabot's opinion of spies as
expressed in his lecture Monday aftei
noon in the Little Theater on "The
Ethics of Spying on our Neighbors in
Time of Peace."
A spy, according to Dr. Cabot's defi
nition, is one who gets information se
cretly and under false pretenses to use
against another for hostile purposes. But
modern espionage is practiced in such a
variety of ways that it ranges from the
ethically unjustifiable forms to those
which Dr. Cabot believes justifiable.
"Spying in war times goes back to the
dawn of history, but only since Bismarck
and the Franco-Prussian war has it ex
isted in time of peace," the speaker ex
plained. "The military attache, while in
uniform, therefore not doing his work
secretly, is nevertheless placed in a for
eign country primarily to determine its
military preparedness. Ambassadors
and like state envoys are engaged in
modified forms of spying. Criminal de
tectives, cash registers ,and many other
common forms of spies are such a part
of our every day life {hat we think noth
ing of the ethics of their use."
Industrial espionage is the most widely
used form of spying and it exists because
of the semi-hostile attitude between em
ployers and employees. The excuse
given that it is regrettable but necessary
to protect property is not sufficient, Dr.
Cabot thinks. He described the working
of modern industrial espionage as he
and an assistant found the conditions to
be from a long and detailed investigation.
Employers hire men to work their way
into power in labor unions in order to
destroy them. Confidence agencies in
cite the unions to strikes that their men
may be employed to put them down. But
while these cases are wholly unjustifi
able, Cabot cited other examples, such
as espionage in banks, as borderline
cases, justified by the necessity for pro
tecting the banks' clients and employees.
According to Dr. Cabot, the espionage
practiced by parents toward their chil
dren, in educational institutions, and in
social and charitable work, is not ethical.
Dr. Cabot is professor of social ethics
at Harvard and is an authority on medi
cal subjects. He is the author of several
well known books on medicine and ethics.

of our every day life {hat we think noth
ing of the ethics of their use."
Industrial espionage is the most widely
used form of spying and it exists because
of the semi-hostile attitude between em
ployers and employees. The excuse
given that it is regrettable but necessary
to protect property is not sufficient, Dr.
Cabot thinks. He described the working
of modern industrial espionage as he
and an assistant found the conditions to
be from a long and detailed investigation.
Employers hire men to work their way
into power in labor unions in order to
destroy them. Confidence agencies in
cite the unions to strikes that their men
may be employed to put them down. But
while these cases are wholly unjustifi
able, Cabot cited other examples, such
as espionage in banks, as borderline
cases, justified by the necessity for pro
tecting the banks' clients and employees.
According to Dr. Cabot, the espionage
practiced by parents toward their chil
dren, in educational institutions, and in
social and charitable work, is not ethical.
Dr. Cabot is professor of social ethics
at Harvard and is an authority on medi
cal subjects. He is the author of several
well known books on medicine and ethics.
