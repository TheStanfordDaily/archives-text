# C.C. Moore To Speak at Varsity Theatre Today
## 
### 
Charles C. Moore, Republican candi
date from California for the United
States senate, will address a rally of his
supporters at the Varsity Theater in
Palo Alto at 4:45 this afternoon. Those
in the party who will accompany Moore
from San Francisco will include Profes
sor James Hyde, G. C. Getty and others.
Machines will meet Moore's party at the
San Mateo county bridge and escort him
to the place of meeting.
Mr. George Martel of the Palo Alto
Furniture Company, who has known
Moore intimately for the last thirty
years, will introduce him to the audience.
Moore will be the only speaker.
The big thing about the campaign, ac
cording to Mr. Frank Hogue, business
man of Palo Alto, is that the people of
the country know that Moore has been a
man who has been doing things in a big
clean way, and a man who has both na
tional and international reputation. He
has perhaps developed more waste land
in California than any other person. He
has agricultural interests in practically
every county of California, according to
Hogue.
