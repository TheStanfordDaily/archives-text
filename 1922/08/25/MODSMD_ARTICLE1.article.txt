# COAST GRID SQUADS READY FOR BIGGEST SEASON IN HISTORY
## BRUIN STARS GONE Conference Coaches Start Teams on Turf Work September 15 
### 
Coast Conference football squads be
gin practice on September 15 preparatory
to the biggest year in western intercol
legiate football history, according to re
ports from the various universities rep
resented. At no time in the past, accord
ing to sporting critics, have the prospects
for such a number of good college teams
been apparent at the beginning of a sin
gle season. This fact, together with the
unanimous aim to defeat the Golden Bear
aggregation, is considered by the ma
jority of the followers of Pacific Coast
football to be an indication of the best
series of grid contests possible.
California has lost enough of her
varsity men to make a big hole in her
unbeaten machine of three years. Aside
from Muller and Berkey at the ends, the
Bear line has almost entirely succumbed
to the effects of education, namely, grad
uation in its most dangerous forms. This
malady, which has been cited as practi
cally fatal to intercollegiate football
competition, broke out in the state insti
tution early last spring and spread to the
training quarters, for years regarded by
cynics as impervious to such calamities.
Before the devastating attack could be
checked, it achieved tremendous damages
in the Bruin ranks. It is believed that
the vacant positions will be filled by
equally good grid champions.
"Baggy" Bagshaw, University of
Washington mentor, exhibits with some
reason his famous "winning" smile.
Aside from some of the best of his 1921
men, the champion Everett High School
eleven of two years ago will appear on
the Sundodger turf on September 13
practically intact. Quass, the mighty
Washington half, who was eligible for
another year's competition, will not re
turn. however.
University ok Washington Out
to Beat Stanford
Encouraged by the tie with Stanford
on the Washington turf last year, the
Sundodgers are planning a raid on the
Cardinal score-bin when they match abil
ities with the local eleven in the Stan
ford stadium. .This is expected to be one
of the hardest games of the season, ac
cording to opinion current in both uni
versities.
Coach Henderson of the University of
Southern California, always credited
with a strong team, is reported to have
unbeatable material at his disposal this
season. Grid fans will have to make a
hard decision when they have to choose
between the Second Varsity and Fresh
man game at and the Stan-
ford-U. S. C. game in November.
Washington State is ready for another
try at the California scalp this year. Gus
Welch, with the strongest team in years,
plans to make his near-victory of 1921
over the Golden Bear a real win this
season.
Oregon Agricultural College, sending
Coach Rutherford at the head its grid
warriors, hopes to send Stanford home
minus a scalp when the southern univer
sity lays siege to Corvallis. This will be
the only game Stanford will play away
from home this year.
To Coach "Shy" Huntington the open
ing of the 1922 season spells the open
season on Bears. The University of
Oregon is purported to have added a
number of first class marksmen to its
football squad in preparation for a sur
prise attack on the California scoriifg
machine of last year.
Coach Mathews of Idaho, director of
the destinies of the University of Wash
ington freshmen in 1921, together with
Kelley, his senior at the Gem State uni
versity, has scoured the Northwest for
football material, and has by no means
failed in his purpose. Since her admis
sion to the Conference, Idaho has
shown more than usual strength in all
major sports, and may be counted on as
a stiff contender for coast titles in the
future.
St. Mary's-Santa Clara Resume
Grid Relations
The desire for football supremacy has
also entered the blood of St. Mary's and
Santa Clara, both of which colleges plan
to build up strong teams through the
medium of historic rivalry. The resump
tion of relations between these two in
stitutions points toward an improved
game in minor colleges on the coast.
The Olympic Club, coached by Bob
Evans, hero of 1919, will be an obstacle
to every California university's claim to
the "undefeated title." The personnel of
the Winged "O" squad is not yet known,
but it is evident that the reputation of
the coach will make the best grid talent
in California available to the club.

To Coach "Shy" Huntington the open

California has lost enough of her
