The term "school is becoming more frequent in its use as referring to
Stanford University, by members thereof. Old Stanford men continually
point out this erroneous conception of the word, and quite generally
lament its prominence in undergraduate expression, and in off-campus
stories and comment that appear concerning activities at the Farm.
"School" does not include within its various meanings that of a Uni
versity. it refers to all lower branches of the American educational
system. Within a university, "school" refers to the various departments,
as the "School of Education."
The quite general use of the word in reference to Stanford in such
expressions as "Captain DeGroot will return to school,'" are perhaps
harmless, and they insult no one; but it is quite ruffling to old-timers to
find "school" now and then thrown at them as referring to a university
which they took great care not to belittle in such manner; and it does
indicate general ignorance on the part of the writer or speaker who insists
on using the term in its wrong sense. It would do no harm to eliminate
the word generally in this questionable connotation, and it would please
many Stanford men.
