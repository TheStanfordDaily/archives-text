# TOO MUCH "STARS"
## 
### 
There is too much emphasis on stars. Young men of athletic ability
no sooner graduate from high school than papers and sporting "experts,"
often for reasons of their own, begin public speculation as to what college
they will attend ; pressure is brought to bear, and the young athlete leads
a hectic life until lie actually matriculates somewhere. There are among
the universities institutions who find their natural attractions not 011 a
parallel with their desired standard in athletics, and consequently the
stars are "attracted" to, or "choose" such universities because of in
fluence and propaganda of representatives or supi)orters of the college.
Activities of these institutions have colored the whole field, and forced
the prep-school stars into believing that unless a university sends some
one around to bid for their services, it must be a place of inconsequence
indeed.
This undue pressure, influence, and publicity is wrong. It sometimes
forces young men to choose colleges not to their best advantage, it always
gives them an exaggerated idea of their own importance, and it is unfair
to them in that it makes them heroes before they have done anythingâ€”in
fact, 011 occasions sets up standards to which it is wholly impossible for
them to live up.
Stanford has never catered to stars from prep schools. We welcome
them certainly, when they choose this as their university; but among the
prominent athletes of the Cardinal fold observers find a larger per
centage of men who were "made" after they came here. Never will a
critic be able to trace success of any Stanford team to the assemblage here
of a group of stars from a certain high school, as was done of another
university recently.
The greatest high school stars seldom make the real college stars.
Often they do not make college teams, while in their places are found
youngsters who have builded themselves up with college training.
"Playing up" the stars is unfair to the men so advertised; and it
blinds a university to the fact that its real purpose is development, not
the acquiring of the already developed. We desire to have here the raw
boned, willing, intelligent youth who wants to learn the Stanford way
of doing things. We are glad to welcome stars as well, but it will be
better if athletic critics and experts will give them a chance to fit into the
Stanford scheme of things and make good here, before heralding them
as saviors of the University.
Anything done to minimize the public emphasis 011 stars goes toward
giving the stars a better deal, and will make in a large way for a more
healthy general athletic complexion.
