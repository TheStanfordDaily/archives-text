It's all right for the goofy prude to
mince and fiddle with his food and fill
the waiter with abuse about a piece of
rubber moose, but from the bird deliver
me who squeezes lemon in his tea. It's
all right for the dinner liound to plank
his hobnails on the ground, to wrap his
napkin 'round his chin and take his knife
and shovel in the spuds and salads found
in sight. Or if he takes a great delight
in dropping pancakes down his neck, or
makes a yell about the check, I still won't
kick about the bird if he won't speak a
single work. I hate, detest and quite
despise the bird who fills his trap with
pies and starts to talk with frightful
noise about the way to bring up boys.'
I'd much prefer to die outright than hear
about the latest fight from some poor
gourmandizing yap who's got a plateful
in his trap. There nev'er was so pressed
a mawk, he had to mix his food with
talk. At least his exercise of rights
might well be used between his bites, and
so I mean to take a club and make a base
hit off the dub who fills his neck with
mayonnaise and then begins to work his
face.

Some time ago I had to stop and go
into a barber shop to get the fuzz shaved
off my cheek and when he'd lathered up
my beak, the barber told a tale decayed
and started in to whet the blade. Be
cause he had me in his power, he waited
for about an hour before lie started in to
shave. He had me half way to the grave.
And while I yet was tired and weak,
this duffer started in to speak about the
wonders of his wares, of tonics that dis
perse gray hairs, of rubs that made a
man feel new and every other kind of
brew that barbers sell behind a laugh at
any gump who'll stand the gaff. So
while I lay without a hope the whiskers
grew up through the soap and while I
trembled at the knees a fly bore down
upon the breeze and tackled my pro
truding nose and that's the way it always
goes. For when he saw me almost dead,
the barber opened up and said that lie
had bought that very day some junk to
keep the flies away. And so when I,
had murmured grace and he had scalped
my tender face, he put some tonic on my
hair that sent the flies out for some air.
A moment later trim and neat, I stag
gered out onto the street, not broke but
very badly bent. All I retained was just
one scent. And while I wandered down
the walk I heard a lot of idle talk about
these two-for-fifteen goofs who put hair
tonic on their roofs. And then a horse
came dashing by with arching neck and
flashing eye, but quickly lost his equine
pride; he took one sniff, then promptly
died. I shook my heels and dashed away
and left behind me fight and fray. If
by a house my speed I'd check, it moulted
shingles by the peck. A path of desolation
drear I left behind for just a year, and so
1 nevermore will use these high-proof
patent barber's brews. But to prevent
such grave results, I'll join one of these
long-hair cults and let my beard grow to
my knees and let it flutter in the breeze,
while all the people shout with glee and
name a hair oil after me.

To those poor souls who read with

rage the contents of this Cabbage page a
spark of hope is kindled now to smooth
the wrinkled from the brow and send a
ray of joy to light the darkness of their
present plight. For one and twenty
months the bird who piled in here word
after word the junk that made them tear
their hair or weep and wail with great
despair is going forth to mend his ways
and give the readers brighter days. And
so with this departing song the writet
hies himself along to leave this page to
brighter wits to send the readers into fits
