### 
Shoes, jerseys, headgears, and other
necessary outfitting for gridiron candi
dates which have been arriving at Stan
ford in various allotments during the
summer, have gone into stock in the En
cina Gymnasium storeroom and now
constitute full equipment ready to issue
to and properly clothe more than 300
football warriors, N. A. Moore, store
keeper, said this morning.
The Stanford equipment for the com
ing season was selected with great care
lsy Coach Glenn Warner and C. E.
Thornhill last spring. Shoes of special
design with novel arranged cone cleats
embodying the ideas of both Warner and
Thornhill as to the proper way of get
ting firm footing in all kinds of weather,
were made in the East by Spalding's.
Specially designed and padded pants are
also secure'd.
All of the jerseys have been manufac
tured by the Olympian Knitting Mills, of
Olympia, Wash. Shoulder pads and
headgears were furnished by Spalding's,
Ellery Arms, and Wilson's of San Fran
cisco.
