# SOME FACTORS IN EVOLUTION' TOPIC OF JORDAN LECTURE
## 
### 
Selection, one of the four main factors
in evolution, is the great coming art in
dealing with plants and animals, in the
opinion of Dr. David Starr Jordan as
expressed in his lecture Wednesday
afternoon in the Little Theater.
"There is nothing original in any ani
mal but the combination," Dr. Jordan
said in speaking of heredity, the first of
the factors of evolution. He described
the distinguishing characteristics of liv
ing organisms, namely, responsiveness or
irritability, metabolism, and reproduc
tion. The reproduction process was illus
trated with charts showing the changes
the cells undergo in both one-celled and
multiple-celled animals.
Variation in evolution is infinite but
overlies a fundamental unity. There are
at present a half million named species
of animals. A species is a definable kind
or form of life that has lasted. Many of
the cultivated varieties of plants and ani
mals would not last if all artificial pro
tection were removed. Burbank has
demonstrated what can be done by the
process of selection in dealing with
plants.
Separation is the fourth factor in evo
lution which Dr. Jordan discussed. When
seeking the nearest kind to a particular
species, the scientist does not look in the
farthest or closest place for it but on the
other side of some natural barrier near.
This is Jordan's law, so-called because
Dr. Jordan was the first to recognize it.
"The Evolution of Man" will be the
topic of Dr. Jordan's lecture next
Wednesday afternoon in the Little
Theater.
