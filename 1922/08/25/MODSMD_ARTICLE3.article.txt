# ONE LANGUAGE FOR ALL PEOPLE NEEDED, DECLARES LECTURER
## Esperanto Considered Most Practical of Proposed Tongues 
### 
The organization of the world on an
international basis makes necessary an
international language, according to the
conclusion reached by Professor Albert
L. Guerard in his lecture Tuesday eve
ning in the Little Theater.
"Although the world is getting smaller
and more closely organized," Professor
Guerard said, "there are today worse
feuds and more mutual misunderstand
ing than ever. Translations and inter
preters are at best tedious and unsatis
factory means of communication. At in
ternational meetings, every speech has
to be repeated in the various languages
of the delegates; these alleged transla
tions take much time and can never be
wholly satisfactory.
"In commercial relations, Americans
know that to retain their place they must
follow the example of the Germans and
speak the other fellow's language. The
language problem is more pressing in
Europe, where at least four languages
are spoken within a 200-mile radius of
any of the capital cities."
The arguments for the adoption of
English as the international language are
based on its simple grammar, its wealth
of words, and the fact that it is spoken
by more people than any other language.
But Professor Guerard, who has taught
English to foreigners, believes that the
simplicity of English is more apparent
than real. It is extremely idomatic and
its pronunciation offers enormous diffi
culties. The chief argument against its
use is that the world will resist any fur
ther encroachment of Anglo-Saxon cul
ture.
With all living languages aside, Latin
is the next candidate for international
adoption. Latin ,according to Guerard,
is not so dead as it is supposed to be;
it is still the language of the Catholic
Church, and is used in higher institutions
of learning. But the extraordinary com
plication of Latin grammar makes it too
cumbrous for practical use.
"An artificial language remains as the
only solution for the problem," the
speaker continued. "The prejudice
against an artificial language is not jus
tified since most of our so-called natural
languages are artificial." Guerard de
scribed briefly the various languages de
vised, of which the most promising is
Esperanto. This is based on modern
languages, particularly the romantic; in
some instances, Esperanto is richer than
any modern language. It is simple, hav
ing only six verbal endings where French
has 2000. Professor Guerard gave a
course in Esperanto when he was a mem

ber of the Stanford faculty.
Personally, Guerard favors a language
based on Anglo-Latin which would be
intelligible to anyone knowing English,
Latin, or any of the romantic languages.
The fundamental argument against the
use of any national language in the in
ternational field is, according to Guerard,
that foreigners will feel free to change
it to suit their needs. The result will be
a corruption of the original language into
a hybrid of neither beauty nor utility.

But Professor Guerard, who has taught
English to foreigners, believes that the
simplicity of English is more apparent
than real. It is extremely idomatic and
its pronunciation offers enormous diffi
culties. The chief argument against its
use is that the world will resist any fur
ther encroachment of Anglo-Saxon cul
ture.
With all living languages aside, Latin
is the next candidate for international
adoption. Latin ,according to Guerard,
is not so dead as it is supposed to be;
it is still the language of the Catholic
Church, and is used in higher institutions
of learning. But the extraordinary com
plication of Latin grammar makes it too
cumbrous for practical use.
"An artificial language remains as the
only solution for the problem," the
speaker continued. "The prejudice
against an artificial language is not jus
tified since most of our so-called natural
languages are artificial." Guerard de
scribed briefly the various languages de
vised, of which the most promising is
Esperanto. This is based on modern
languages, particularly the romantic; in
some instances, Esperanto is richer than
any modern language. It is simple, hav
ing only six verbal endings where French
has 2000. Professor Guerard gave a
course in Esperanto when he was a mem

ber of the Stanford faculty.
Personally, Guerard favors a language
based on Anglo-Latin which would be
intelligible to anyone knowing English,
Latin, or any of the romantic languages.
The fundamental argument against the
use of any national language in the in
ternational field is, according to Guerard,
that foreigners will feel free to change
it to suit their needs. The result will be
a corruption of the original language into
a hybrid of neither beauty nor utility.
The organization of the world on an
international basis makes necessary an
international language, according to the
conclusion reached by Professor Albert
L. Guerard in his lecture Tuesday eve
ning in the Little Theater.
"Although the world is getting smaller
and more closely organized," Professor
Guerard said, "there are today worse
feuds and more mutual misunderstand
ing than ever. Translations and inter
preters are at best tedious and unsatis
factory means of communication. At in
ternational meetings, every speech has
to be repeated in the various languages
of the delegates; these alleged transla
tions take much time and can never be
wholly satisfactory.
"In commercial relations, Americans
know that to retain their place they must
follow the example of the Germans and
speak the other fellow's language. The
language problem is more pressing in
Europe, where at least four languages
are spoken within a 200-mile radius of
any of the capital cities."
The arguments for the adoption of
English as the international language are
based on its simple grammar, its wealth
of words, and the fact that it is spoken
by more people than any other language.
