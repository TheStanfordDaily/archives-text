# KERR TO SEE CARDS FOR FIRST TIME ON INITIAL PRACTICE
## THORNHILL HAS LEAD Coach E.P. Hunt Announces First Babe Practice September 17 
### 
Coach Andrew Kerr, new chief of
Stanford football, will take his first look
at Cardinal gridiron material September
15, which has been set as the initial day
of practice for the fall season. C. E.
Thornhill, line coach, assisted "Pop"
Warner in direction of spring practice
last May, and therefore has a slight lead
on the head coach in familiarity with the
players. However, there will be manj'
men of first string caliber who were not
participants in the spring workouts, and
the two members will have a full time
job in classifying the candidates of the
squad which undoubtedly will number
near 100 men.
Coach Hunt announces the first fresh
men practice for September 17. As yet
no assistants have been named for Hunt,
though he will unquestionably require
help in handling the mob which always
appears for the first-year team. The
ffeshmen squad last year was larger than
that of the varsity for some time. Hunt
is desirous of developing every possibility
among the yearlings, and for that reason
will continue several teams through the
season. No candidates who show any
adaptability to the gridiron will be
dropped. It is possible that two separate
teams will be maintained to play the
heavy freshman schedule, neither desig
nated as the first freshman team until
ten days before the California game,
when the strongest eleven possible will
be made up.
Assistant Coach Betts, who will have
charge of the second Stanford varsity
this fall, is optimistic as to possibilities
for this eleven. Several players of var
sity strength will be ineligible for the
first eleven by technical conference rul
ings .among them quarterback Lawson,
and with these men as a nucleus Betts
expects to have a real machine. Kerr
expects the second eleven to develop play
ers for the varsity of the coming year.
Among the returning varsity men will
be Captain DeGroot, center* former
Captain Art Wilcox, halfback; Fred
Ludeke, tackle; Dick Faville, guard;
Scotchie Campbell, guard, end, and quar
terback; Sproule and Mertz, ends. Out
standing among candidates from fresh
men and former freshmen teams are
Cuddeback, fullback; Jim Arthur, guard;
Shipkey, tackle; and Bob Janssen, end.
The survey of the field of probable can
didates includes a number of promising
men who have never before appeared on
the Stanford turf, and although there
seems to be somewhat of a dearth of
backfield material, the line men loom up
strong, and athletic authorities are hope
ful of a good beginning this fall in the
establishing of the Warner system of
football.
