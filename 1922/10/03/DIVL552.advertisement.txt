I NO ONE more appreciates the new Parker Duofold
than the students who play golf. The moment you
grasp it your hand responds to that unmistakable feel

1 1 a sensation akin to the pleasure of gripping your favorite
SIP club. It holds nearly twice the ink of the ordinary.
It has a point of native Iridium —as smooth and life-enduring as
• a rare jewel bearing —and guaranteed 25 years for wear and me
mm chanical perfection.
