# STRUCTURAL WORK ON NEW HOUSING UNITS IS STARTED
## Board of Athletic Control to Build Dormitory With the Receipts From the Stadium 
### 
Actual construction work on a $450,-
000 men's dormitory and dining hall
capable of caring for five hundred stu
dents, was begun last month, in ac
cordance with the University's 1922
building program. Using gate receipts
from games in the new stadium as a
basis of payment an additional dormi
tory;-resembling in many respects the
one now tmder construction, will be
ejected immediately by the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control.
For what is probably the first time
in the history of American college ath
letics, development on a huge scale
of a non-athletic project will be finan
ced by profits from the use of the
stadium, which was heretofore regard
ed as a source of income for athletics I
only. The great earning powers of!
the stadium, together with the econ-1
omy effected in its construction, has '
I
already practically cleared up the j
structure's debts, and has thus early ,
placed it in a position to be made a i
factor in the increase of the Stanford ;
endowment. The unexpected decision !
of the Board of Athletic Control to
use proceeds from athletics for struc- j
tural purposes materially advances'
the building program of the Univer- i
eity.
The dormitory to be built by the j
Board of Athletic Control will be paid
for on a long-time basis. The first i
Thornhill has been drilling the varsity
line candidates, while Kerr himself Iwn
dles the backs.
Two things stand out in the reams of
early season "copy" written about the
Cardinal varsity:—a strong line, and a
strong coaching staff. For the first time
since 1919, there are two capable men for
each of the seven line positions. Captain
DeGroot, center, Ludeke, Faville, and
Cravens, guards, all weigh over 195 and
have played on Stanford varsities of
i other years. Shipkey, tackle, Dole,
Steele, and Janssen, ends, are recruited
from the 1925 outfit. Among the new
comers are Johnson from Los Angeles,
tackle; Pheney, named as All-Western
Conference guard in 1920, guard;
Loomis, a second team man last year,
tackle.
It is the backficld, however, which is
causing Kerr to furrow his brow. One
halfback position is fixed. That goes to
Art Wilcox, former captain, and veteran
of three Big Games. Wilcox has been
calling the signals, and is likely to do so
for some time to come. Kerr has moved
"Scotchy" Campbell, an erstwhile guard
and end, into the quarterback position,
although Woodward and Wheat are also
fighting for the job. Paul Murray, a
substitute last year, and Cuddeback have
been working at halfback and fullback,
respectively. Murray is rather light, but
knows the game and is good at carrying
the ball.
Kerr, a rather small man, who con
trasts sharply with the bulk of Thorn
hill. was at Pittsburgh from 1914 until
1921, coaching the freshman teams.

building program. Using gate receipts
from games in the new stadium as a

Board of Athletic Control.
For what is probably the first time
in the history of American college ath
letics, development on a huge scale
of a non-athletic project will be finan
ced by profits from the use of the
stadium, which was heretofore regard
ed as a source of income for athletics I
only. The great earning powers of!
the stadium, together with the econ-1
omy effected in its construction, has '

already practically cleared up the j
structure's debts, and has thus early ,
placed it in a position to be made a i
factor in the increase of the Stanford ;
endowment. The unexpected decision !
of the Board of Athletic Control to

Thornhill has been drilling the varsity
line candidates, while Kerr himself Iwn
dles the backs.
Two things stand out in the reams of
early season "copy" written about the
Cardinal varsity:—a strong line, and a
strong coaching staff. For the first time
since 1919, there are two capable men for
each of the seven line positions. Captain
DeGroot, center, Ludeke, Faville, and
Cravens, guards, all weigh over 195 and
have played on Stanford varsities of
i other years. Shipkey, tackle, Dole,
Steele, and Janssen, ends, are recruited
from the 1925 outfit. Among the new
comers are Johnson from Los Angeles,
tackle; Pheney, named as All-Western
Conference guard in 1920, guard;
Loomis, a second team man last year,
tackle.
It is the backficld, however, which is
causing Kerr to furrow his brow. One
halfback position is fixed. That goes to
Art Wilcox, former captain, and veteran
of three Big Games. Wilcox has been
calling the signals, and is likely to do so
for some time to come. Kerr has moved
"Scotchy" Campbell, an erstwhile guard
and end, into the quarterback position,
although Woodward and Wheat are also
fighting for the job. Paul Murray, a
substitute last year, and Cuddeback have
been working at halfback and fullback,
respectively. Murray is rather light, but
knows the game and is good at carrying
the ball.
Kerr, a rather small man, who con
trasts sharply with the bulk of Thorn
hill. was at Pittsburgh from 1914 until
1921, coaching the freshman teams.

tice last spring, was formerly line coach
