at the College of the Pacific and also
at the Greek Theatre of the University
of California, where an audience of
6.500 greeted her with enthusiasm. Dur
ing the season of 1917 Mrs. David filled
170 engagements as assisting artist on
the farewell tour of Mine. Sarah Bern
hardt.
Mrs. David's playing is noteworthy for
its technical brilliancy, its finished style,
and its warm interpretative qualities.

ing a harpist and the soundness of her
: ;il equipment is always apparent in
her playing, file harp is generally con
sidered disappointing as a solo instru
ment, but Mrs. David makes it both
interesting and beautiful. The press in

this artist warmly enthusiastic notices;
all agree that she is pre-eminent.
