# VARSITY COACHES DRILL CARDINALS FOR OLYMPIC GAME
## Backfield Still Remains Mystery; Plenty of Heavy Experienced Candidates Out for Line 
### 
l*or two weeks "Little Andy" Kerr, assisted by "Tiny" Thornhill, has been
putting the Cardinal varsity through the fundamentals—backwards, forwards, and
cross-wise, until now the forty-one veterans and near-veterans are ready to start
on the more intricate part of gridiron science.
Beginning today, the twice-a-day practice, in effect since September 15, gives
way to the single session in the afternoon. Kerr will devote this week to providing
his men with a repertoire of plays and a defense adequate to carry them through
the opening game with the Olympic Club next Saturday.
Kerr sent his first string candidates against "Red" Betts' Grays in the first
informal game of the season Saturday morning. After the first half, the contest
turned into a scrimmage, with the varsity carrying the ball most of the time.
Doughty, halfback on the 1921 eleven, broke through center twice for fiftv-vard

. v.,» l w iv. v. k\ji niljr-vaiu
runs, and Cuddeback, fullback on Stay's
freshman team last year, made three suc
cessful place kicks from the forty-yard
line.
1 he line-up which started against the
Grays, and which seems in a fair way to
open against the Olympics, follows:
Janssen, Dole, ends; Shipkey, Johnson,
tackles; Ludeke. Cravens, guards; De-
Groot, center; Campbell, quarter; Wil
cox, Doughty, halfbacks; Cuddeback,
fullback. Neither Murray, first string
halfback, nor Douglas, who played
guard on Van Gent's varsity, was in the
fray. Murray injured his leg Thursday,
while Douglas has only been out since
Friday. Douglas tips the scales at 200
pounds, but is fast for a man of his
weight, and Kerr is grooming him for
the fullback position, which he played on
the 1923 freshman team.
To date, the practices have been rather
quiet from the point of view of the
spectator. Within four days after the
first call. September 15, there were
nearly a hundred names on the rosti r, a
record turn-out at Stanford for vacation
practice. Kerr 1< -1 little time in weed

players, turning them over to Belts.
payment will be made with the ?40,-
000 which accrues to the Advisory
Board of the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion, after having been temporarily
applied to the stadium, by agreement
with the original contributors.
Construction of the new housing
unit will probably be finished simul
taneously with the dormitory now be
ing built by the University Xt is ex
pected that the two buildings will be
ready for occupancy by about the be
ginning of the Spring quarter. Both
units are a part of the University
housing system, which will eventu
ally include several more such dormi
tories to be built within the next few
years. Income from the second mil
lion of the endowment will be used
to build the third unit as soon as the
money is raised.
These buildings combine all the
best features of housing accommoda
tions furnished by colleges and uni
versities all over the country, having
been designed after a thorough study
had been made of systems everywhere
by the architects, by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
Each of the new units will house
four living groups of thirty-four each,
totalling 136 men to each unit. The
buildings are planned so as to give
each group one of the four wings of
the dormitory with a living room for
each group and a large clubroom for
all four. In addition to this, one din
ing room is provided for each group,
all four of which will be served by a
common kitchen.
Each wing of the new buildings will
be comprised of fifteen or more two
room suites, which will quarter two
men each. One room in every suite
will be equipped with French windows
so that the best sleeping arrange
ments will be provided without being
interfered with by activities in the
other room —the study. Plenty of light,
air, and running hot and cold water,
not to mention drinking fountains,
steam heat and rooms for group meet
ings, are among the advantages to be
offered by the buildings. On the sec
ond floor above the main club hall
there will be a group of fifteen or
more guest rooms.
The dormitory to be finished by the
University itself, is located across the
road at the east of Encina. It will
form the key building to a quadrangle
of living groups.
The unit to be constructed by the
Board of Athletic Control will be built
south of the first dormitory on the
east side of the road, opposite the
library. The road between Mayfield
and the campus, running diagonally
to the square of the Quad back of En
cina Hall, is being done away with.
As in the case of the new Stanford
Union, the dormitories are all to be
constructed of reinforced concrete and
have red-tiled roofs. Buff sand-stone,
similar to that used in tlip Quad build
ings, will be fitted in for ornamental
effects.

Construction of the new housing
unit will probably be finished simul
taneously with the dormitory now be
ing built by the University Xt is ex
pected that the two buildings will be
ready for occupancy by about the be
ginning of the Spring quarter. Both
units are a part of the University
housing system, which will eventu
ally include several more such dormi
tories to be built within the next few
years. Income from the second mil
lion of the endowment will be used
to build the third unit as soon as the
money is raised.
These buildings combine all the
best features of housing accommoda
tions furnished by colleges and uni
versities all over the country, having
been designed after a thorough study
had been made of systems everywhere
by the architects, by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth.
Each of the new units will house
four living groups of thirty-four each,
totalling 136 men to each unit. The
buildings are planned so as to give
each group one of the four wings of
the dormitory with a living room for
each group and a large clubroom for
all four. In addition to this, one din
ing room is provided for each group,
all four of which will be served by a
common kitchen.
Each wing of the new buildings will
be comprised of fifteen or more two
room suites, which will quarter two
men each. One room in every suite
will be equipped with French windows
so that the best sleeping arrange
ments will be provided without being
interfered with by activities in the
other room —the study. Plenty of light,
air, and running hot and cold water,
not to mention drinking fountains,
steam heat and rooms for group meet
ings, are among the advantages to be
offered by the buildings. On the sec
ond floor above the main club hall
there will be a group of fifteen or
more guest rooms.
The dormitory to be finished by the
University itself, is located across the
road at the east of Encina. It will
form the key building to a quadrangle
of living groups.
The unit to be constructed by the
Board of Athletic Control will be built
south of the first dormitory on the
east side of the road, opposite the
library. The road between Mayfield
and the campus, running diagonally
to the square of the Quad back of En
cina Hall, is being done away with.
As in the case of the new Stanford
Union, the dormitories are all to be
constructed of reinforced concrete and
have red-tiled roofs. Buff sand-stone,
similar to that used in tlip Quad build
ings, will be fitted in for ornamental
effects.
l*or two weeks "Little Andy" Kerr, assisted by "Tiny" Thornhill, has been
putting the Cardinal varsity through the fundamentals—backwards, forwards, and
cross-wise, until now the forty-one veterans and near-veterans are ready to start
on the more intricate part of gridiron science.
Beginning today, the twice-a-day practice, in effect since September 15, gives
way to the single session in the afternoon. Kerr will devote this week to providing
his men with a repertoire of plays and a defense adequate to carry them through
the opening game with the Olympic Club next Saturday.
Kerr sent his first string candidates against "Red" Betts' Grays in the first
informal game of the season Saturday morning. After the first half, the contest
turned into a scrimmage, with the varsity carrying the ball most of the time.

Each of the new units will house
four living groups of thirty-four each,
totalling 136 men to each unit. The
buildings are planned so as to give
each group one of the four wings of
the dormitory with a living room for
each group and a large clubroom for
all four. In addition to this, one din
ing room is provided for each group,
all four of which will be served by a
common kitchen.
Each wing of the new buildings will
be comprised of fifteen or more two
room suites, which will quarter two
men each. One room in every suite
will be equipped with French windows
so that the best sleeping arrange
ments will be provided without being
interfered with by activities in the
other room —the study. Plenty of light,
air, and running hot and cold water,
not to mention drinking fountains,
steam heat and rooms for group meet
ings, are among the advantages to be
offered by the buildings. On the sec
ond floor above the main club hall
there will be a group of fifteen or
more guest rooms.
The dormitory to be finished by the
University itself, is located across the
road at the east of Encina. It will
form the key building to a quadrangle
of living groups.
The unit to be constructed by the
Board of Athletic Control will be built
south of the first dormitory on the
east side of the road, opposite the
library. The road between Mayfield
and the campus, running diagonally
to the square of the Quad back of En
cina Hall, is being done away with.
As in the case of the new Stanford
Union, the dormitories are all to be
constructed of reinforced concrete and
have red-tiled roofs. Buff sand-stone,
similar to that used in tlip Quad build
ings, will be fitted in for ornamental
effects.
l*or two weeks "Little Andy" Kerr, assisted by "Tiny" Thornhill, has been
putting the Cardinal varsity through the fundamentals—backwards, forwards, and
cross-wise, until now the forty-one veterans and near-veterans are ready to start
on the more intricate part of gridiron science.
Beginning today, the twice-a-day practice, in effect since September 15, gives
way to the single session in the afternoon. Kerr will devote this week to providing
his men with a repertoire of plays and a defense adequate to carry them through
the opening game with the Olympic Club next Saturday.
Kerr sent his first string candidates against "Red" Betts' Grays in the first
informal game of the season Saturday morning. After the first half, the contest
turned into a scrimmage, with the varsity carrying the ball most of the time.
Doughty, halfback on the 1921 eleven, broke through center twice for fiftv-vard

. v.,» l w iv. v. k\ji niljr-vaiu
runs, and Cuddeback, fullback on Stay's
freshman team last year, made three suc
cessful place kicks from the forty-yard
line.
1 he line-up which started against the
Grays, and which seems in a fair way to
open against the Olympics, follows:
Janssen, Dole, ends; Shipkey, Johnson,
tackles; Ludeke. Cravens, guards; De-
Groot, center; Campbell, quarter; Wil
cox, Doughty, halfbacks; Cuddeback,
fullback. Neither Murray, first string
halfback, nor Douglas, who played
guard on Van Gent's varsity, was in the
fray. Murray injured his leg Thursday,
while Douglas has only been out since
Friday. Douglas tips the scales at 200
pounds, but is fast for a man of his
weight, and Kerr is grooming him for
the fullback position, which he played on
the 1923 freshman team.
To date, the practices have been rather
quiet from the point of view of the
spectator. Within four days after the

Construction of the new housing
unit will probably be finished simul
taneously with the dormitory now be
ing built by the University Xt is ex
pected that the two buildings will be
ready for occupancy by about the be
ginning of the Spring quarter. Both
units are a part of the University
housing system, which will eventu
ally include several more such dormi
tories to be built within the next few
years. Income from the second mil
lion of the endowment will be used
to build the third unit as soon as the
money is raised.
These buildings combine all the
best features of housing accommoda
tions furnished by colleges and uni
versities all over the country, having
been designed after a thorough study
had been made of systems everywhere
by the architects, by President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and by Comptroller Al
