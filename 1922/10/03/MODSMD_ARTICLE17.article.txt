# VARSITY COACHES DRILL CARDINALS FOR OLYMPIC GAME
## Backfield Still Remains Mystery; Plenty of Heavy Experienced Candidates Out for Line 
### 
l*or two weeks "Little Andy" Kerr, assisted by "Tiny" Thornhill, has been
putting the Cardinal varsity through the fundamentals—backwards, forwards, and
cross-wise, until now the forty-one veterans and near-veterans are ready to start
on the more intricate part of gridiron science.
Beginning today, the twice-a-day practice, in effect since September 15, gives
way to the single session in the afternoon. Kerr will devote this week to providing
his men with a repertoire of plays and a defense adequate to carry them through
the opening game with the Olympic Club next Saturday.
Kerr sent his first string candidates against "Red" Betts' Grays in the first
informal game of the season Saturday morning. After the first half, the contest
turned into a scrimmage, with the varsity carrying the ball most of the time.
Doughty, halfback on the 1921 eleven, broke through center twice for fiftv-vard

runs, and Cuddeback, fullback on Stay's
freshman team last year, made three suc
cessful place kicks from the forty-yard
line.
1 he line-up which started against the
Grays, and which seems in a fair way to
open against the Olympics, follows:
Janssen, Dole, ends; Shipkey, Johnson,
tackles; Ludeke. Cravens, guards; De-
Groot, center; Campbell, quarter; Wil
cox, Doughty, halfbacks; Cuddeback,
fullback. Neither Murray, first string
halfback, nor Douglas, who played
guard on Van Gent's varsity, was in the
fray. Murray injured his leg Thursday,
while Douglas has only been out since
Friday. Douglas tips the scales at 200
pounds, but is fast for a man of his
weight, and Kerr is grooming him for
the fullback position, which he played on
the 1923 freshman team.
To date, the practices have been rather
quiet from the point of view of the
spectator. Within four days after the
first call. September 15, there were
nearly a hundred names on the rosti r, a
record turn-out at Stanford for vacation
practice. Kerr 1< -1 little time in weed
ing out the inexperienced and ineligible
players, turning them over to Belts.
