# RUSHING, BUYING TAKE UP MEETING OF FRATERNITIES
## 
### 
Several changes were made in the
system of rushing freshmen at the
meeting ot the Inter fraternity Confer
ence in th* 1 Union last night. Co
operative buying by fraternities and
other living groups was also discussed.
New date cards, which will be distri
buted by fraternities, contain spacfc
for but two dates. lunch and dinner.
The lunch date is understood to in
clude the afternoon, and the dinner
date includes the evening. It was
recommended that all freshmen bo out
of the house of 9:30. It was formerh
the rule that a man "hashing"' in a
fraternity might not be pledged until
one quarter after he left the position.
When the new constitution was adopt
ed last quarter there was no such pro
vision made, so this restriction is now
off.
Ernest Moeller reported on con
tracts for staple articles which have
been closed by the co-operative buy
ing committee. Under this plan the
thirty-seven fraternities, sororities and
other living groups iVpresented. will
be able to buy meat, groceries, vege
tables, milk, etc., about ten per cent
cheaper.
