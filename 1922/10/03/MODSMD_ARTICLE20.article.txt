# HUNT WORKING TO BUILD STRONG LINE ON FRESHMAN TEAM
## Line Material Light, While Backfield Men Are Heavy; Two Games Next Saturday 
### 
With two games scheduled for Sat
urday, Coach E. P. Hunt, freshman
grid mentor, is putting his Cardinal
yearlings through their paces daily,
on the old football field.
Andy Smith, California Varsity
Coach, and Hunt, are facing much the
same problems in welding together a
football machine this year. Both have
material and a great deal of it but
most of the promising candidates are
backfield nyu. The Card babes who
are trying for positions on the lines
are, in most cases, lacking in the
necessary "beef."
In the backfield, Ernie Nevers, 190
pound fullback, from Santa Rosa,
stands head and shoulders above the
other candidates. Nevers is big and
fast and hits the line low and hard.
Fred Solomon, 172 pound halfback
from Los Angeles, is a hard hitter and
a dangerous open field runner.
Paul Fassoth, who played center for
Hitchcock Military Academy last year
' seems to be a favorite for that posi
tion on the babe eleven. Fassoth is
a six-footer and weighs 170 pounds.
At guard, Barnett of Santa Rosa and
Widaman of Los Angeles are showing
up well. Cleo Davis of Rochester,
Pennsylvania, Bob Nicholson of Twin
Falls, Idaho, and Arlan Sholes of Long
Beach, are the leading candidates for
positions at tackle. Davis is "Tiny"
Thornhill's nephew and although light,
from early season dope, appears to be
the goods. Nicholson and Sholes both
'come with high school reputations.
Nicholson weighs 160 and Sholes 170.
The babes will meet Long Beach
I High School at 1:30 Saturday after
i noon, and Oakland High School in the
I morning, at 10:30.
