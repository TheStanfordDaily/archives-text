An editor of the Daily Palo Alto some day may
have to stretch the truth a hit when he sarts oft" his
first issue with the remark that "this is going to be
the best year yet," but we hope not. So far, such
declarations have borne at least some semblance of
the truth. And this particular editor sensing the
general feeling of enthusiasm regarding the new
coaching staff, the football team, the success of the
endowment, the beginning of widespread University
expansion, and the improvement of living conditions
is not going to be cheated out of trying to express
that feeling. As Leshinsky of Casino fame says,
"Beezness eez good." It is to be hoped that there
will always be reason for Stanford people to admire
themselves once a year.
