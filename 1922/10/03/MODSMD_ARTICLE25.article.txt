# NEW ORGANIZATION AND APPOINTMENTS
## 
### 
Kenneth Stewart today becomes Managing Editor
of the Daily Palo Alto. He has been a member of
the staff for almost three years, has served in all
positions on the paper, and leaves his place as rank
ing news editor to assume his new duties. Under
the new organization of the Daily Palo Alto, the
Managing Editor is responsible chiefly for the
make-up of the paper and gives only such time to
the supervision of the news field as is necessary to
keep the news machine in good working order.
It is unnecessary to say that Stewart's work has
been of high caliber and that his attitude has always
been one of helpfulness as a staff member. The
f "act that he becomes Managing Editor today, after
having made his way alone and without "outside
pull"' from the position of unknown reporter to his
present place tells the story in itself. The promo
tion is made purely 011 a basis of merit.
With this issue, Marion Potter assumes the duties
of Women's Editor of the Daily Palo Alto. She
will supervise the women's news field through the
department editors and will endeavor to keep the
two chief news fields in their proper positions.
Miss Potter has been a member of the staff for
over two years and has served both as reporter and
news editor. It is to her constructive and conscien
tious work that she owes her appointment. Under
Miss Potteif the Daily Palo Alto should become a
better source of news for Stanford women.
Maurine Voerge atul Pearl Bundick are promoted
today to the positions of News Editor. In addi
tion to having charge of the news desk once a week,
each will have other duties under the new organiza
tion. Miss Voerge will take charge of the Organ
izations Department, while Miss Bundick will be in
charge of proof and exchanges. Both are promoted
as a result of their faithful and efficient services on
the staff.
The new organization, briefly, is a division of the
news field into four departments: sports, women's
athletics, dramatics, and organizations. These are,
of course, general in name. A News Editor super
vises the work of the reporters in each department,
thus dividing what has heretofore been the work of
the Managing Editor and the News Editor for each
day into four parts. It is hoped that the new plan
will relieve the strain 011 the Managing Editor and
the staff member at the desk, at the same time cov
ering the news field more thoroughly.
Glenn Pollard, ranking news editor, will hereafter
be responsible for the duties of Telegraph Editor.
Arrangements have been made to carry a three-hour
drop-service from the United Press for a resume of
the world news condensed in one column on the
front page of the Daily Palo Alto. Pollard will
edit this copy and make it available for tabloid use.

the staff for almost three years, has served in all
positions on the paper, and leaves his place as rank
ing news editor to assume his new duties. Under
the new organization of the Daily Palo Alto, the
Managing Editor is responsible chiefly for the
make-up of the paper and gives only such time to
the supervision of the news field as is necessary to
keep the news machine in good working order.
It is unnecessary to say that Stewart's work has
been of high caliber and that his attitude has always
been one of helpfulness as a staff member. The
f "act that he becomes Managing Editor today, after
having made his way alone and without "outside
pull"' from the position of unknown reporter to his
present place tells the story in itself. The promo
tion is made purely 011 a basis of merit.
With this issue, Marion Potter assumes the duties
of Women's Editor of the Daily Palo Alto. She
will supervise the women's news field through the
department editors and will endeavor to keep the
two chief news fields in their proper positions.
Miss Potter has been a member of the staff for
over two years and has served both as reporter and
news editor. It is to her constructive and conscien
tious work that she owes her appointment. Under
Miss Potteif the Daily Palo Alto should become a
better source of news for Stanford women.
Maurine Voerge atul Pearl Bundick are promoted
today to the positions of News Editor. In addi
tion to having charge of the news desk once a week,
each will have other duties under the new organiza
tion. Miss Voerge will take charge of the Organ
izations Department, while Miss Bundick will be in
charge of proof and exchanges. Both are promoted
as a result of their faithful and efficient services on
the staff.
The new organization, briefly, is a division of the
news field into four departments: sports, women's
athletics, dramatics, and organizations. These are,
of course, general in name. A News Editor super
vises the work of the reporters in each department,
thus dividing what has heretofore been the work of
the Managing Editor and the News Editor for each
day into four parts. It is hoped that the new plan
will relieve the strain 011 the Managing Editor and
the staff member at the desk, at the same time cov
ering the news field more thoroughly.
Glenn Pollard, ranking news editor, will hereafter
be responsible for the duties of Telegraph Editor.
Arrangements have been made to carry a three-hour
drop-service from the United Press for a resume of
the world news condensed in one column on the
front page of the Daily Palo Alto. Pollard will
edit this copy and make it available for tabloid use.
