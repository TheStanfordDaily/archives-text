# STANFORD'S LOSS
## 
### 
Tn Dean Huston and Trainer Moulton Stanford
has lost two of her strongest and most loyal men.
Both were authorities in their fields of activity and
both gave the best they had to offer to Stanford
projects and to Stanford people. Student tribute, in
order to be in keeping with the work and modes of
life of these two men, is best shown in sincerity and
simplicity. All Stanford keenly feels the loss and
extends her sympathies to the mourning relatives.
