# TWO-DAY REGISTRATION
## 
### 
That the administration is in sympathy with the
needs of students is again shown by the adoption
of the two-day registration period. Heretofore, reg
istration has been an inefficient, hurried process, full
of petty annoyances, which caused students to fill
their schedules with the first courses in sight. It
was thought to be easier to make haste in registra
tion and then to petition for a change after the ex
citcfnent and rush was over. Several days were thus
lost to many students. The evils of this program
are for the most part gone.
Stanford students may show their appreciation of
this change by taking more care in their choice of
courses. They are given more time and no longer
need rush the administration with petitions.
