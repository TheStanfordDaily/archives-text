# CABBAGES and THINGS H.M '24

### 
Right here we want to state, for the information of
Freshmen, and also those who read this column last
year, that this is the funny part of the paper. We try
to make it easy for you to g«t the point, but a safe
rule to follow is to laugh at every asterisk.
* * *
With that understanding, Cabbages steps before the
footlights for another year's turn. Overture! Curtain!

Valiant little man (to bully who is threatening vio
lently)— Say, you big false alarm, what do you think
you could do to me, huh?
* * *
Bully—Why you runt, I'll mash your nose for you.
What do you think you are going to do?
V. L. M.—Say, you talk like that at me any more
I'll—l'll—l'll hang up the recoiver, that's what I'll do!

Abie Mazda registered today. He is a transfer from
Leavenworth with more hours to his credit than a
time-clock. He is so dumb he thought the Peninsular
Transit Company was a surveying outfit, and to prove
it showed us the line they had run out to the University.
He thought the Kentuck Derby was the niftiest thing
in headgear he had seen for many years. He wanted
to know what the uniform was here, and after he had
his registration picture taken lie asked where the hair
clipper was. He came down to the Press Building to
get his pants pressed, and wanted to know how to get
to the Romantic Language building so he could 'earn
how to talk to the goils, see? Altogether, he says that
he knows he is going to like the university swell, be
cause he has hopped all the pipes recommended to him
and hast only one final, and that's in track.

It ain't not proper to say, "I ain't." "I ain't no*" is
more widely, used.
"Did you use to use," according to authorities, is not
is coherent as "Didn't youse usen't to use?"
The slang phrase, "Hadn't oughter," should be aban
doned, and the virile "should not have ought" substi
tuted.
What is wrong with this sentence: "She done him out
of twenty dollars."
Correct this sentence: "With a cheerful smile he
handed his wife his pay envelope."

THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN BEING AS FIT AS
A FIDDLE AND BEING TIGHT AS A DRUM.
