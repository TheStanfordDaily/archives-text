NEW YORK, Oct. 2.—With official
titles to the pennants, instead of mathe
matical certainties, the New York Giants
and the Yankees were brushing up today
for the world's series.
John McGraw, manager of the Na
tional League champions, and Miller
Muggins, the pilot of the American
League pennant winners, ordered their
charges to report at the Polo grounds
t<xlay for a light workout.
With the exception of a few minor
ailments, both clubs were reported in
good shape and ready to present their
full strength in the opening games
Wednesday.
Babe Ruth has been nursing a strained
side that he pulled in batting practice a
few days ago, but he said today that it J
wasn't bothering him and that the old
swing was all ready.
The first of the reserved seats for the
series were mailed out of both offices
last night. Although the demand was
said to be heavy, a few researved scats
were still available today.
With the exception of appointment of
umpires, which is expected today, every
thing is in readiness for the opening of
the series. Neither manager, of course,
has selected a pitcher to go out after
the first game, but it is considered almost
a certainty that the Giants will play be
hind Arthur Nehf and that Joe Bush
\yll be sent to the mound by Manager
Huggins-.
