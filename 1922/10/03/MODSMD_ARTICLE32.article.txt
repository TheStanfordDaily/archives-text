# HARD SCHEDULE FACES ANDY KERR'S ELEVEN
## 
### 
All but three of the nineteen games
scheduled for the Cardinal varsity, sec
ond varsity, and freshmen will be played
at the Stanford Stadium. Two, and
sometimes three, games will be on the
card for the seven Saturdays preceding
the Big Game on November 25.
Only one of the eight varsity contests,
that with the Oregon Agricultural Col
lege, October 28, will be played off the
campus. By the vagaries of the schedule
Kerr's eleven will face the Olympic Club,
one of its hardest opponents, on the open
ing day. Inasmuch as the clubmen are
largely recruited from the ranks of
former college stars, under the coaching
of Bob Evans, former Stanford coach,
they have developed this year into one
of the most-feared elevens on the Coast.
The majority of the hard contests for
the Card varsity, however, come at the
end of the season. A game with the
University of California 011 November
11, followed by a tussle with Bagshaw's
Washington Vikings 011 November 18,
make the going just before the California
game particularly difficult.
Stanford will meet the Pittsburgh
Panthers, coached by Glenn Warner, in
a late season game at the Stanford Sta
dium, December 30. It will be Pitt's
first visit to the Pacific Coast, while
Stanford has not engaged in intersec
tional or international football competi
tion for ten years.
