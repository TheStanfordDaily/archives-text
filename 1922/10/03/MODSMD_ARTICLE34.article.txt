# GRIDIRON EQUIPMENT FOR 300 IN GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
Enough football equipment for 300
gridiron candidates has been received by
Encina Gymnasium Store to date, about
two-thirds of which has already been
issued, according to N. A. Moore, the
storekeeper.
The Stanford equipment was selected
by Glenn Warner and C. E. Thornhill
last spring. Shoes of special design with

cone cleats, embodying the ideas of both ,
Warner and Thornhill and satisfying the
demands of Coach Kerr as to the proper
way of getting tirm footing in all kinds
of weather, were made in the East by
Spaulding's.
All of the jerseys have been manu
factured by the Olympian Knitting Mills
of Olympia, Washington. Shoulder pads
and head gears were furnished by
Spaulding's, Eilery Arms, and Wilson's I
of San Francisco.
