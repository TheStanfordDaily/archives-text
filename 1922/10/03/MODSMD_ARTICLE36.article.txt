# LIGHT GAMES OPEN COAST CONFERENCE GRIDIRON SEASON
## 
### 
With the exception of the Santa Clara-
California game, there was very little
doing in Pacific Coast Conference cir
cles over the week-end. The University
of Washington and the University of
Oregon elevens also went into action,
but their opponents were distinctly third
rate teams.
CALIFORNIA, 45—SANTA CLARA, 14
The ancient, but not antiquated, criss
cross play, with Spaulditig carrying the
ball, threw the hooks into Buckingham's
saints in the opening game at Berkeley
Saturday. The Blue and Gold eleven,
yet in the formative period, had
some difficulty with the Missionites when
the ball was in the center of the field.
As soon as the Bruins advanced the pig
skin to the thirty-yard line, however,
Captain F.rb called for the ancient criss
cross and Spaulditig plowed his way
through for ten and twelve yards at a
crack.
Santa Clara undoubtedly had a better
team than the-score shows. With a little
better tackling, a good kicker, and a bet
ter line-plunger they would have come
close to tying the Coast champions. As
it was, the Bruin line was none too good
on the defense, especially for the aerial
game, and the Mission line drifted
through and blocked two punts, which
led to the Santa Clara scores.
Andy Smith's new line, with Gal
lagher, center; Clark and Perry, guards;
Witter and Perry, tackles; Berkey and
Hufford, ends, showed that it will
need plenty of work before it will even
begin to compare with the 1921 line.
Hufiford and Berkey, although they did
good work in spots, were taken out of
the play again and again by the Saint
tackles.
Buckingham has three real players on
his eleven: Noll, tackle; Kerchoff, end,
and Noonan, quarter. There is plenty of
weight, the players know the game, and
they fight hard.
PITTSBURG, 37—CINCINNATI, 0
The Pittsburgh Panthers, under the
tutelage of "Pop" Warner, who will
come to Stanford in 1924, had little
trouble in disposing of Cincinnatti in the
opening game at Cincinnatti.
The score at half was 13 to 0, but Pitt
made two touchdowns in the third and
fourth quarters. Warner made numer
ous substitutions in the final period;
Anderson, right half on Warner's team,
accounted for two touchdowns, as did
Sauer, who took Williams' place at right
end.
The chief point of interest to the
Coast, however, was the apparent failure
of the place kick as a means of securing
the extra point after touchdown. John
son and Gwosden only kicked one goal
ont of six attempts.
Kerr is drilling Art Wilcox on this
same method on the "try-for-a-point," as
provided by the new rules. \\ ilcox, with
Campbell holding the ball, was able to
put it all over "Dink" Templeton, who
was kicking drops to secure the point.
CALIFORNIA FRESHMEN, 44—
LOWELL, 6
"Crip" Toomey's much - discussed
Bruin Cubs might as well have stayed at
home, for all the good they got out of
the game with Lowell. The first string
freshmen were able to pierce the Lowell
line at will and Jimmy Dixon, the sensa
tional halfback from Berkeley High, was
able to make yards just about as he
pleased. After the first quarter Toomey
took out Cock, Blewitt, Dixon, and Carl
son, his first string backfield, and shot
in his second team.
Lowell's attack was built around the
quarterback, Anderson, who stationed
himself ten to twelve yards back of the
line. The ball was invariably snapped to
him, whence he would run, pass or kick
as the occasion demanded. Lowell's only
score came on a long forward pass,
Anderson to Van Horn.
