# TERMAN APPOINTED DEPARTMENT HEAD
## 
### 
Lewis M. Terman, formerly Professor
of Educational Psychology at Stanford,
is now executive head of the Department
of Psychology, having been appointed to
that position early in the summer. He
succeeded Professor Frank M. Angell,
who had been head of the Psychology
department since 1892, and who retired
at the close of the spring quarter at the
age of 65.
Professor Terman has been at Stan
ford since 1910. He received his A. B.
degree from Indiana in 1902, his M. A.
in 1903, and his Ph. D. in psychology at
Clark University in 1905. After receiv
ing his doctor's degree, Terman was ap
pointed principal of the San Bernardino
high school, where he made considerable
investigation into child psychology and
hygiene. After publishing several
articles on health work in the schools, he
narrowed his field to that of genius and
stupidity and the intelligence of school
children, the outcome of which was the
publication in 1919 of his book, "The In
telligence of School Children."
Since he has been at Stanford, Profes
sor Terman has perfected the Stanford-
Binet intelligence test, and his work
recently has been along the line of
measuring intelligence and perfecting
mind tests. Last year he made a study
of gifted children, using the grant of
$20,300 awarded by the Commonwealth
Fund of New York City.
In addition to the appointment of Dr.
Terman, two additional men were secured
this summer for the Psychology depart
ment. Dr. W. R. Miles, former phvchol
ogist at the Nutrition Library of the
Carnegie Institute, will have charge of
experimental and systematic psychology.
Dr. Calvin P. Stone, former instructor in
psychology and neurology at the Lniver
sity of Minnesota, will conduct courses
on mental hygiene and animal behavior.
