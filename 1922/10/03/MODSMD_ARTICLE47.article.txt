The success of Democracy is as
sured, if the class of 1926 is any indi
cation of healthy attitude, in spite
of peon pants, college stripes, syn
thetic gin, amateur theatricals and
other malign evils which flourish in
this our civilized age.
At 7:55 yesterday the line of
bedinked greenlings reached from the
Administration Building, around the
corner as far as the Econ Steps, or
even further, according to how en
thusiastic you become at the relating
of this. Clutching ninety-six dollars
in their sweating palms, the myriad
freshmen awaited the zero hour.
Eight o'clock struck. The line
moved as one man. They charged
with a whispered "ah" of gloating vic
tory. In mass attack the frosh rush
ed. Batallion after were
thrown into the gap, but still the de
fenses held.
The result is that the stout oaken
portal now hangs on one screw—a
mute testimony to the American
thirst for education at any cost. It
is expected that the administration
will raise the entrance requirements
for athletics in retaliation.
