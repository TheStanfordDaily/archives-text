# Regulations Regarding Highway Traffic to Be Ceaselessly Enforced
## 
### 
"Report to Judge Robinson at Santa
Clara next Friday morning at 9 o'clock."
This nishing command was uttered
to just as astonished ears at Junction
on the main highway from Palo Alto to
San Jose. Automobilists who believe in
keeping company with the Speed Demon
or others of his tribe will now have to
hie to foreign parts. No more can cars
traverse the highway unmolested, with
cross-eyed lamps, the absence of lights,
and (4her kindred ailments. No longer
can they thus travel ship-shodly, for the
strong arm of the law is at last making
itself felt.
A student was the miscreant who drew
the wrathful command above. His spot
light was on the blink. Two other cars
were being given similar treatment at
Junction the same time. He counted no
less than thirteen traffic cops on the
stretch of road between San Jose and
Pacific City. Unlucky indeed 1
The supervisors of the Peninsula cam
paign for making the highways safer
stak that motorists will be under the
ceaseless scrutiny of officers by day and
by night, and the regulation designed to
promote safety and minimize possibility
of accidents will be strictly enforced.
Special attention will be paid to the
arrest of speeders and those whose head
lights are not properly adjusted.
