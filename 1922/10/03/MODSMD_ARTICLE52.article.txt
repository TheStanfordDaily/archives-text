# STUDENT CAFETERIA STARTS BUSINESS IN BASEMENT OF UNION
## 
### 
The new cafeteria and lunch room,
which has been installed in the base
ment of the old Union, was opened
for business yesterday. Meals will
be served at all hours of the day, and
the cafeteria will remain open until
11 o'clock at night. It is hoped that
this latest addition will serve as a
social "hang-out" and a meeting place
for the men students of the Univer
sity.
Modern equipment, including short
order ranges, a food warming ap
paratus, and dishwashing machinery,
has been set up. The basement has
been entirely remodelled and all furni
ture and fixtures are new. Cooked
food will be prepared in the kitchen
of the new Union and will be trans
ported to the cafeteria in specially
constructed food trucks.
