# FIRE ENGINE POMPS WATER FOR CAMPOS
## 
### 
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb has been
demonstrating the non-professional uses
of the fire-engine the last three days by
forcing the Seagrove motor pump to
furnish pressure for the entire campus
water system. The old, noisy, thrust
pump which used to be stationed next to
the power-house has been dismantled and
the station moved to the other side of
the campus, near the Cactus Gardens,
where the newest model turbine will
commence pumping as soon as the in
stallation is complete.
The only advantage which the old
pump has over the new is in the clear
ness of the water it produces. The
whirling blades of the turbine throw out
a milky-appearing water. This is caused
by minute bubbles of air, which disap
pear when the water is allowed to stand
a while. For capacity and pressure, the
turbine is more than adequate.
The local department has lately an
nounced October 9 as National Fire Pre
vention Day. According to the Marshal,
the most common cause of bad tires is
rubbish. Spontaneous combustion, care
lessness with matches and cigarettes,
other inflammables, faulty wiring, chem
ical action, and numerous other causes
serve to start conflagration when com
bined with filth and dirt, and then com
plicate the fire-fighting task.
Last quarter, attempt was made to hold
a clean-up day for the double purpose of
assisting in fire prevention and producing
a neat campus, a considerable item for a
university which is soliciting new addi
tions to its equipment. This quarter
there will not be the numerous conflict
ing dates to hold up the drive and in all
probability a clean-up day will be rec
ommended, if not for October 9, then a
short time after rushing is over and
things settle down.
Further announcement of the details
and organization will be published soon.
