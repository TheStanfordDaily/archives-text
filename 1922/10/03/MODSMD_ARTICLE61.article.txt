# ALTERATIONS ARE MADE IN ENCINA GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
Larger and better quarters have been
installed in Encina Gymnasium for the
graduate manager's office and various
other have been made to care
for the growing needs of the staff. The

new offices for the graduate manager
have been constructed in what was here
tofore the connection hall between the
outer corridor and the gymnasium floor
proper at the west end of the building.
The east hall only will be used here
after.
Four new dressing rooms for visiting
teams are provided in the quarters vacat
ed by the graduate manager. At times,
particularly in the spring quarter, the
visiting rooms have been crowded. Rooms
are required for as many as six to eight
teams at times.
The gymnasium store and towel ex
change has been moved out of the east
locker room to larger accommodations in
the central part of the north wing just
opposite the physical director's office.
The store occupies one-third of the
space of the former lecture hall there.
The space vacated by the store will be
used for additional lockers, as will that
of the remaining portion of the old
lecture room.
