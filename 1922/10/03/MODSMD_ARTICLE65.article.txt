## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct* 2.—(United
Press.) The United States government
is going to exert its influence to the full
est possible extent in the interest of peace
in the Near East and for the protection
of American interests, a high adminis
tration official declared today.
This statement was made in reply to
inquiries concerning a cable sent to Sec
retary of State Hughes by Bishop James
Cannon of the Methodist Episcopal
Church of the South, who has been mak
ing an investigation of conditions in the
Near East.
Bishop Cannon urged Hughes to take
definite action to stop alleged Turkish
atrocities. His cable was received today
at the State Department.
Twelve United States destroyers, un
der command of Captain C. M. Tozer,
started for Constantinople from the naval
base shortly before 11:30 o'clock today.
The flagship left the dock first and the
others swung in line behind her as she
started down Hampton Road.
Judging from dispatches from Con
stantinople, London, Paris, and else
where today, the immediate danger of a
war between Great Britain and Turkey
in the Near East has been averted.
From all indications, the proposal of
Mustapha Kemal, leader of the Turkish
nationalists, th'at representatives of G*cat
Britain, France, Italy, and Greece meet
Turkey in a preliminary peace parley to
be held at Mudania tomorrow, would be

accepted by the powers. France imme
diately accepted the invitation.
Although the British may view with
disfavor the demand of Kemal that he
he allowed to occupy Thrace as far as
the Maritza river immediately, it was
thought that Great" Britain would not
turn down Kemal's proposals on this
ground. The whole attitude of Great
Britain in the matter has been concilia
tory to the extent that the maintenance
of her prestige would allow.
The Chanak area of the Dardanelles
zone, where it was thought that a clash
between the British and Turks was im
minent, was quiet today. The Kemalists
had nude good their promise to make no
further military moves and were reported
to be withdrawing slightly in some sec
tions.
