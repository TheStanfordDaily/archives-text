# Students Active In College Affairs Get Best Marksâ€”Pictorial
## 
### 
Stanford students who take part in
college activities have a better scholar
ship average than those who do nothing
but study, according to an article in this
month's issue of the Stanford Pictorial.
The average ratio of grade points to
registered hours given by the writer,
who has averaged the grades of people
in all the different classes of activities
for comparison.
Debaters lead the long list of activities,
with a record second only to Phi Beta
Kappa by organization. Journalists,
dramatists, and student officers, both
men and women, surpass the non-activ
ity element materially, according to the
author's figures.
Major sport participants are slightly
lower than the general University aver
age, but none of them except baseball
seems to be in any particular danger of
colliding with the academic rocks.
"The record made by Stanford
wrestlers is a tribute to Strangler Lewis
and other strong-armed gentlemen of
mat fame," says the author. "As a mat
ter of fact the Stanford representatives
of this sport arc nothing short of intel
lectual giants. Their score in the point
column even surpasses that of the most
studious group of women by organiza
tion and everybody knows how the fair
sex stands in the 'bawl-out.'"
The conclusion drawn by the writer is
that activities do not interfere with
scholarship. "If they do," he says,"it
must be admitted that without the handi
cap of extra-curricular activities this
group of students would do even better
work and would thus be pointed to as the
real scholars of the University. It will
probably be easier for Stanford people
to admit the old saying, 'All work and no
play makes Jack a dull boy.'"
