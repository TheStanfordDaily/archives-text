# POSTER FIGHT IS SET FOR FRIDAY MORNING
## Rules Governing Annual Clash Between Underclassmen to Be Drawn Up This P.M. 
### 
The date for the annual poster and
water fight between the rival underclass
men has been tentatively set for Friday
morning, some time in the early morn
ing, with the tie-up occurring that after
noon.
A committee appointed by Philip F.
Landis, '23, President of the Associated
Students, and consisting of Bob Con
nolly, '23, Lane Falk, '23, DcWitt Ber
tram!, '23, A1 Masters, '23, Claude Peavy,
'23, Don Snedden, '23, and Roy William
son, 23, will meet in the student body
offices in the Administration building this
afternoon at 4 o'clock, at which meeting
the definite time for the fight will be
decided. Rules and regulations govern
ing the conduct of the underclass brawl
will be drawn up.
Landis said this morning: "The
112 shman-sophomore poster fight is now
the chief interclass contest of the colk-ge
year and as such must be guarded care
fully. The rules must be strictly ad
hered to ivst the fighi be p'acoti in
jeopardy."
As the fight has been run in the past,
both classes will meet at designated
places Thursday afternoon, following
which they will retreat to camps in the
hills. During the night the '26 men will
station small groups of scouts at various
points on the campus to prevent the lay
ing of posters before the poster rush on
the Row. Some time early Friday morn
ing both classes will meet on the Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, and Kappa
Kappa Gamma lawns, and will commence
fighting when a gun is fired. The class
which succeeds in carrying on the most
offensive work in the internal applica
tion of Searsvillc water will be declared
the victor at the end of the allotted half
hour.
The tie-up will probably occur on the
old football field Friday afternoon. Both
sides will take opposite ends of the field
and will rush together when the gun is
fired, each making an effort to tie up as
many of the opposing side as possible.
No one can be thrown in the respective
"morgues" without first being tied, and
no one can leave the pens after having
once been painted.
Varsity "S" men will be on hand at
both fights to see that no violations of
the rules occur.
