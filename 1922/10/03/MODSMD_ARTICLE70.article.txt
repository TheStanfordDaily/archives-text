# What's the Use Anyway? Things Ain't What They Used To Be Say Roughs
## 
### 
Things aren't what they used to
be. Not meant in any carping or
critical spirit, or course, but they just
aren't.
Registration has lost its attractions,
its zest of—eh—ah, me, its thrill
of discovery. No use to get up at 7
a.m., on a cold and windy morning
ai:y more, so's to stand at the lower
end of a long line. There's no induce
ment. '
Skirts have come down. In fact,
they're down now. That it to say,
they're longer. If, by any chance, you
happen to register today, you probably
noticed. Or rather, didn't notice. For
all we know, the freshman girlies of
'26 might have worn hose labelled
"for fire only."
It's rough on the roughs.
