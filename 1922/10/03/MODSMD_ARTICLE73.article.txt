# DO THEY EVER COME BACK? "BULLETJOE" BUSH SAYS HE WILL
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 3. —Do they ever
come back? The answer to this anci
ent bromide today is as much in doubt
as it was thirty years ago. Some say
they do and some say they don't.
"Bullet Joe" Bush, leading speed
ball pitcher of the New York Yanks,
and almost certain to start against the
Giants in the opening game tomorrow,
has ridden the crest of the wave of
fame, and dropped into the trough of
obscurity. Now, nine years after all
writers acclaimed him as the latest
addition to the Hall of Fame, he seems
destined to play the stellar role again.
Just ten years ago Bush was pitching
Class C ball for Missoula, Montana,
in the old Northwestern League. The
scouts for Connie Mack, the elongated
leader, whose Philadelphia Athletics
were winning one world's champion
ship after another, picked up Bush and
sent him East. In 1913 he acted as
relief pitcher for Chief Bender and
Eddie Plank, the athletic aces.
When Plank and Bender gave out
in the world's series against the
Giants, Mack shot Bush into the
breach and the youngster smoked
balled the McGraw's men to defeat.
As a recruit on a championship team
Bush had jumped from an unknown
bench-warmer to the heio of the
series.
The pitcher failed to rise to the
heights the following year, however,
and when Mack scrapped his "million
dollar" infield, Bush was sold to the
Boston Americans, where he languish
ed for several seasons. Then he came
to the Yanks in a trade, and seeming
ly recovered his cunning of ten years
ago, this season leading the Yank
pitchers with twenty-four victories.
Even though nine years have elapsed
since he turned back the Giants, and
although he is no longer a youngster,
Bush has more than an even chance
to repeat his former victories, and to
again be hailed as the hypothetical
"hero" of the 1922 world's series.
