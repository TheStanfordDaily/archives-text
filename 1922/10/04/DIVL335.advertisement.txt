It will pay you to
listen to this music
*
ALL over the country the whistle is blowing for
l the kick-off, the start of that great game —
another college year.
Be on your toes when the whistle blows. A good
start will carry you well on toward your goal.
Let the football candidate start by working
away till his muscles ache from bucking the line.
Let the aspirant for manager put in careful
study of his team's needs, always eager to help
— arranging a trip or carrying a pail of water.
Let the publications man be alert for news and
tireless in learning the details of editorial work.
Whatever activity you come out for, crowd a
lot of energy into these early Fall days.
And if a good start helps win campus honors,
tit helps win class room honors, too. The sure way
to be up in your work is to aim now for regularity
at lectures, up-to-date note-books and particular
attention to the early chapters of text-books, thus
getting a grip on the basics.
This is best in the long run, and —selfishly —it is
easiest in the long run. That is, if life after college is
made easier by the things a bigger income can buy.
