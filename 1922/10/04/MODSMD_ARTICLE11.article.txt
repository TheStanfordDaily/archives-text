# VARSITY PRACTICES IN STADIUM TODAY; HARTRANFT RETURNS
## 
### 
There were three new developments
in the Cardinal varsity football situa
tion yesterday. The first was the
arrival of "Tiny" Hartranft, of cinder
path fame, who had hitherto been
counted out as potential material for
the Card eleven. The second devel
opment was the surprising strength
shown by Kerr's second set of backs,
and the third was the return to the
once-a-day practice, from 4 until 6.
This afternoon Kerr and Thornhill
took the first squad to the Stadium
turf, which has not been in use since
spring practice. The varsity will prac
tice there hereafter.
Were Hartranft as good at football
as he is at hurling the discus and heav
ing the shot, the Stanford line would
be "made,"' for the tall blond, with
his mark of 10 flat in the hundred
yard dash, would make an ideal end.
In his prep school days he was named
all southern tackle, but he failed to
show much on the 1921 varsity. Kerr
realizes his possibilities, and will
groom him for one of the relief ends,
probably.
Hartranft 1 as fallen off considerably
in weight since last spring, but like
Ludeke, ought to start gaining im
mediately. He took it easy yesterday
and did little besides throwing and
catching passes.
The two mentors drilled their
charges in tackling, blocking, charg
ing and the like for half an hour yes
terday, and then called for Betts' sec
ond varsity. The first team was given
the ball and a carte blanche order to
make a touchdown. Doughty, Cudde
back, and Wilcox, the first-string
backs were able to make few substan
tial gains through the Gray's line. The
team that Kerr started follows:
Ends —Janssen and Dole.
Tackles —Johnson and Shipkey.
Guards —Houck and Faville.
Center —DeGroot.
Quarter —Wheat.
i Halfbacks —Wilcox, Doughty.
Fullback —Cuddeback.
Things began to move, however,
when Kerr made substitutions. Ludeke
went in for Cravens, Dennis for Wil
cox, and Taylor for Cuddeback. You
can't get away from the idea that Den
nis, former freshman skipper, knows
real football and plays it. He hit the
line hard, and went through for five
yards and more every time. Taylor,
also, did some good line bucking, with
Wheat directing the team and grab
bing off an occasional forward pass.
That combination made more head
way against the Grays than the regu
lar backs, and in picking any line up
for the Olympic contest, Saturday,
they must be given consideration.
The race for quarterback narrows
down, seemingly, to Campbell and
Wheat, with Woodward as a "dark
horse." Campbell holds the edge in
weight, but Wheat is able to call the
signals, and is perhaps better in re
ceiving forward passes.
