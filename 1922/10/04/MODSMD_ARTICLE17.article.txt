# NEW COURSES PLANNED IN MILITARY SCIENCE
## 
### 
On the advice of the faculty mili
tary advisory committee, Major Col
lins has revised the course of s*udy in
military science for the first two
years. The new system, which has
been approved by President Wilbur,
was designed to enable students to
take the reserve officers' training with
out conflict with other university
work. Such conflict has in the past
seriously hampered the work of the
department. Engineers, especially,
on account of the long laboratory peri
ods in the afternoon have found diffi
culty in arranging a schedule.
Hereafter the first year course will
consist of a one unit course each quar
ter, coming three hours a week. This
will be practical, and will fulfill the
physical training requirements. In
the second year beside the practical
course there will be a two-unit theo
retical. However, the latter may be
taken in the first year if it is more
convenient.
