# OLD WORLD DIPLOMACY TRIES TO AVERT WAR IN NEAR EAST
## 
### (By United Press 
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. t— Secret
diplomacy of the old world school
was employed at the little Samora
seaport city of Mudania today in an
effort to avert a great religious war
in the Near East.
Allies and Turks resumed their pre
liminary peace parley on arrival of
Greek delegates, whose absence yes
terday caused postponement of the
conference.
The Greeks will refuse to evacuate
Thrace, it is understood. Greece is
expected to prove adamant on this
point and to present a stumbling block
to peaceful procedure of negotiations
at Mudania. The Ottoman commander
has made this evacuation one of his
armistice conditions. The present par
ley is designed merely to offset ar
mistice conditions. The entire success
of the conference apparently hinges
on this point. •
