# HARP RECITAL OPENS TUESDAY MEETINGS
## 
### 
Warm interpretative qualities and bril
liant technique marked the playing of
Annie Louise David in her harp recital
last night in the Memorial Church. Mrs.
David plays with the feeling of a vir
tuoso and the technical skill that comes
from faithful study. Although generally
considered disappointing as a solo instru
ment. the harp becomes both beautiful
and interesting in Mrs. David's hands.
