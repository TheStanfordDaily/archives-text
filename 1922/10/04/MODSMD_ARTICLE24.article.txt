# NO RULES HAVE BEEN VIOLATED SAYS BARROW
## Breach Precipitated in Ranks of Conference by Demand To Cancel Pittsburgh Game 
### 
Branding the "investigation" of the
Stanford-Pittsburgh game as a thing
"which may have had its inception, not
within the Pacific Coast Cosference, but
in the south, where dreams of a holiday
season monopoly are being disturbed,"
W. H. Barrow, director of physical edu
cation for men, indicated today that the
Board of Athletic Control would see that
the scheduled game goes through even if
Stanford has to withdraw from the con
ference.
We cannot now cancel our Pittsburgh
game if we would. If the majority of
the representatives still feel that our
action is contrary to the best wisdom of
the conference or in any degree repre
hensible, we will have 110 other alterna
tive but to resign from the conference,"
said Barrow in a statement issued this
afternoon.
Discontent among northern members,
rumored ever since the Pitt game was
scheduled for the Stadium December 30,
broke into print yesterday when U. G.
Duback of O. A. C., conference presi
dent, announced that a meeting had been
called for Saturday in Portland to de
termine what action should be taken on
Stanford's "grave breach of conference
rulings."
The events, which have precipitated
the crisis, in their chronological order,
follow:
1. At August meeting of conference,
Stanford declares it will not represent
West at Pasadena if asked, and that the
conference might use the Stanford
Stadium for a game, unless Stanford had
a game of its own.
2. Conference fails to come to terms '
with the Tournament of Roses.
3. Stanford officials, prior to final ar
rangements for Pitt contest, inquire of
conference whether any move has been
started to bring an Eastern team to the
coast. Are told not.
4. After game is scheduled, Duback of
Oregon takes telegraph vote among
members as to whether Stanford shall be
"punished."
5. Stanford asked to cancel Pittsburgh
game September 30 and Board of Ath
letic Control refuses. Meeting of con
ference members called next Saturday.
Barrow's statement issued, not by way
of apology, but to make Stanford's po
sition clear, follows:
"It seems to me the action of certain
members of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence in regard to the New Year's game
and their hasty judgment of us is, to
quote Washington Irving, 'like the ap
proach of a horse to a drum—with much
prancing and little progress, and too
often with the wrong end foremost.'
"The conference decided at its August
meeting to have the game on New Year's
day. Several stadias were at that time
available, but no final action could be
taken, because of the all-important fac
tor, a desirable eastern contestant, could
not be found. Now that Stanford has
gone ahead and arranged for a friendly
holiday contest in her own stadium, cer
tain members of the conference appar
ently accuse us of flagrant violation of
rules and ethics before looking up the
rules or hearing the case.
"The facts are these: The rule adopt
ed at the recent conference meeting is
that no team in the Pacific Coast Con
ference shall take part in a New Year's
Day intersectional game except the rep
resentative chosen by the conference. At
that same meeting Stanford indicated
she did not care to be considered in con
nection with this year's conference game,
and did not wish to share in any pro
ceeds of such a game, and reserved for
herself full freedom of action. Our po
sition was that although it might be of
interest to certain colleges, especially
those from Oregon and Washington, to
play at Pasadena, Stanford has her own
stadium, and if she played at all it would
be there.
"Owing to the failure of the confer
ence to come to satisfactory terms with
the Tournament of Roses, the question
arose as to whether or not the Stanford
Stadium would be available. I feel sure
that if a conference game in the stadium
could have been originally proposed to
us our Board of Control would have re
served the stadium for that game. Be
fore closing with Pittsburgh, we re
quested an assurance and were informed
by President Duback of the conference
that no progress had been made toward
securing an eastern contestant.
"In view of the uncertainty and to se
cure for northern California and for
ourselves a holiday season game, we
scheduled the Pittsburgh contest for De
cember 30. The main objection seems
to be that a game at any time during the
holiday season will detract from the in
terest of a game in the south, but that
point was considered at the last confer
ence meeting, and the members of the
conference should abide by the conse
quences of their ruling.
"At the conference meeting the coming
Saturday, our position will be outlined
just as I have given it. Furthermore,
we. cannot now cancel our Pittsburgh
game if we would. If the majority of
the representatives still feel that our ac
tion is contrary to the best wisdom of
the conference or in any degree repre
hensible, we will have no alternative but
to resign from the conference. It seems
highly regrettable that the happy rela
tions of the conference members have
been disturbed and that this issue has
been raised on the nebulous uncertainty
of a conference game more than 500
miles away. In fact, it seems possible
that this righteous indignation and storm
of protest had its inception not within
the conference, but in the south where
dreams of a holiday season monopoly
are being disturbed."

to resign from the conference. It seems
highly regrettable that the happy rela
tions of the conference members have
been disturbed and that this issue has
been raised on the nebulous uncertainty
of a conference game more than 500
miles away. In fact, it seems possible
that this righteous indignation and storm
of protest had its inception not within
the conference, but in the south where
dreams of a holiday season monopoly
are being disturbed."
Branding the "investigation" of the
Stanford-Pittsburgh game as a thing
"which may have had its inception, not
within the Pacific Coast Cosference, but
in the south, where dreams of a holiday
season monopoly are being disturbed,"
W. H. Barrow, director of physical edu
cation for men, indicated today that the
Board of Athletic Control would see that
the scheduled game goes through even if
Stanford has to withdraw from the con
ference.
We cannot now cancel our Pittsburgh
game if we would. If the majority of
the representatives still feel that our
action is contrary to the best wisdom of
the conference or in any degree repre
hensible, we will have 110 other alterna
tive but to resign from the conference,"
said Barrow in a statement issued this
afternoon.
Discontent among northern members,
rumored ever since the Pitt game was
scheduled for the Stadium December 30,
broke into print yesterday when U. G.
Duback of O. A. C., conference presi
dent, announced that a meeting had been
called for Saturday in Portland to de
termine what action should be taken on
Stanford's "grave breach of conference
rulings."
The events, which have precipitated
the crisis, in their chronological order,
follow:
1. At August meeting of conference,
Stanford declares it will not represent
West at Pasadena if asked, and that the
conference might use the Stanford
Stadium for a game, unless Stanford had
a game of its own.
2. Conference fails to come to terms '
with the Tournament of Roses.
3. Stanford officials, prior to final ar
rangements for Pitt contest, inquire of
conference whether any move has been
started to bring an Eastern team to the
coast. Are told not.
4. After game is scheduled, Duback of
Oregon takes telegraph vote among
members as to whether Stanford shall be
"punished."
5. Stanford asked to cancel Pittsburgh
game September 30 and Board of Ath
letic Control refuses. Meeting of con
ference members called next Saturday.
Barrow's statement issued, not by way
of apology, but to make Stanford's po
sition clear, follows:
"It seems to me the action of certain
members of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence in regard to the New Year's game
and their hasty judgment of us is, to
quote Washington Irving, 'like the ap
proach of a horse to a drum—with much
prancing and little progress, and too
often with the wrong end foremost.'
"The conference decided at its August
meeting to have the game on New Year's
day. Several stadias were at that time
available, but no final action could be
taken, because of the all-important fac
tor, a desirable eastern contestant, could
not be found. Now that Stanford has
gone ahead and arranged for a friendly
holiday contest in her own stadium, cer
tain members of the conference appar
ently accuse us of flagrant violation of
rules and ethics before looking up the
rules or hearing the case.
"The facts are these: The rule adopt
ed at the recent conference meeting is
that no team in the Pacific Coast Con
ference shall take part in a New Year's
Day intersectional game except the rep
resentative chosen by the conference. At
that same meeting Stanford indicated
she did not care to be considered in con
nection with this year's conference game,
and did not wish to share in any pro
ceeds of such a game, and reserved for
herself full freedom of action. Our po
sition was that although it might be of
interest to certain colleges, especially
those from Oregon and Washington, to
play at Pasadena, Stanford has her own
stadium, and if she played at all it would
be there.
"Owing to the failure of the confer
ence to come to satisfactory terms with
the Tournament of Roses, the question
arose as to whether or not the Stanford
Stadium would be available. I feel sure
that if a conference game in the stadium
could have been originally proposed to
us our Board of Control would have re
served the stadium for that game. Be
fore closing with Pittsburgh, we re
quested an assurance and were informed
by President Duback of the conference
that no progress had been made toward
securing an eastern contestant.
"In view of the uncertainty and to se
cure for northern California and for
ourselves a holiday season game, we
scheduled the Pittsburgh contest for De
cember 30. The main objection seems
to be that a game at any time during the
holiday season will detract from the in
terest of a game in the south, but that
point was considered at the last confer
ence meeting, and the members of the
conference should abide by the conse
quences of their ruling.
"At the conference meeting the coming
Saturday, our position will be outlined
just as I have given it. Furthermore,
we. cannot now cancel our Pittsburgh
game if we would. If the majority of
the representatives still feel that our ac
tion is contrary to the best wisdom of

"At the conference meeting the coming
Saturday, our position will be outlined
just as I have given it. Furthermore,
we. cannot now cancel our Pittsburgh
game if we would. If the majority of
the representatives still feel that our ac
tion is contrary to the best wisdom of
the conference or in any degree repre
hensible, we will have no alternative but
to resign from the conference. It seems
highly regrettable that the happy rela
tions of the conference members have
been disturbed and that this issue has
been raised on the nebulous uncertainty
of a conference game more than 500
miles away. In fact, it seems possible
that this righteous indignation and storm
of protest had its inception not within
the conference, but in the south where
dreams of a holiday season monopoly
are being disturbed."
Branding the "investigation" of the
Stanford-Pittsburgh game as a thing
"which may have had its inception, not
within the Pacific Coast Cosference, but
in the south, where dreams of a holiday
season monopoly are being disturbed,"
W. H. Barrow, director of physical edu
cation for men, indicated today that the
Board of Athletic Control would see that
the scheduled game goes through even if
Stanford has to withdraw from the con
ference.
We cannot now cancel our Pittsburgh
game if we would. If the majority of
the representatives still feel that our
action is contrary to the best wisdom of
the conference or in any degree repre
hensible, we will have 110 other alterna
tive but to resign from the conference,"
said Barrow in a statement issued this
afternoon.
Discontent among northern members,
rumored ever since the Pitt game was
scheduled for the Stadium December 30,
broke into print yesterday when U. G.
Duback of O. A. C., conference presi
dent, announced that a meeting had been
called for Saturday in Portland to de
termine what action should be taken on
Stanford's "grave breach of conference
rulings."
The events, which have precipitated
the crisis, in their chronological order,
follow:
1. At August meeting of conference,
Stanford declares it will not represent
West at Pasadena if asked, and that the
conference might use the Stanford
Stadium for a game, unless Stanford had
a game of its own.
2. Conference fails to come to terms '
with the Tournament of Roses.
3. Stanford officials, prior to final ar
rangements for Pitt contest, inquire of
conference whether any move has been
started to bring an Eastern team to the
coast. Are told not.
4. After game is scheduled, Duback of
Oregon takes telegraph vote among
members as to whether Stanford shall be
"punished."
5. Stanford asked to cancel Pittsburgh
game September 30 and Board of Ath
letic Control refuses. Meeting of con
ference members called next Saturday.
Barrow's statement issued, not by way
of apology, but to make Stanford's po
sition clear, follows:
"It seems to me the action of certain
members of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence in regard to the New Year's game
and their hasty judgment of us is, to
quote Washington Irving, 'like the ap
proach of a horse to a drum—with much
prancing and little progress, and too
often with the wrong end foremost.'
"The conference decided at its August
meeting to have the game on New Year's
day. Several stadias were at that time
available, but no final action could be
taken, because of the all-important fac
tor, a desirable eastern contestant, could
not be found. Now that Stanford has
gone ahead and arranged for a friendly
holiday contest in her own stadium, cer
tain members of the conference appar
ently accuse us of flagrant violation of
rules and ethics before looking up the
rules or hearing the case.
"The facts are these: The rule adopt
ed at the recent conference meeting is
that no team in the Pacific Coast Con
ference shall take part in a New Year's
Day intersectional game except the rep
resentative chosen by the conference. At
that same meeting Stanford indicated
she did not care to be considered in con
nection with this year's conference game,
and did not wish to share in any pro
ceeds of such a game, and reserved for
herself full freedom of action. Our po
sition was that although it might be of
interest to certain colleges, especially
those from Oregon and Washington, to
play at Pasadena, Stanford has her own
stadium, and if she played at all it would
be there.
"Owing to the failure of the confer
ence to come to satisfactory terms with
the Tournament of Roses, the question
arose as to whether or not the Stanford
Stadium would be available. I feel sure
that if a conference game in the stadium
could have been originally proposed to
us our Board of Control would have re
served the stadium for that game. Be
fore closing with Pittsburgh, we re
quested an assurance and were informed
by President Duback of the conference
that no progress had been made toward
securing an eastern contestant.
"In view of the uncertainty and to se
cure for northern California and for
ourselves a holiday season game, we
scheduled the Pittsburgh contest for De
cember 30. The main objection seems
to be that a game at any time during the
holiday season will detract from the in
terest of a game in the south, but that
point was considered at the last confer
ence meeting, and the members of the
conference should abide by the conse
quences of their ruling.
