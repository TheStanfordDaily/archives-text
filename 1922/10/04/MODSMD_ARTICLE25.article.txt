# Work on Proctor Statue Cast Is Well Under Way
## 
### 
Work on the plaster cast of Phimster
Proctor's statue, the "Circuit Rider," is
well under way in the Aerodynamics
Laboratory, under the direction of Rob
ert Paine, the inventor of the device used
by sculptors to increase, in scale, the life
size plaster statue from the artist's
model. When the first plaster cast is
finished, a mold is taken, and a new east
is made in sections. These sections are
usually sent to New York, where a sand
mold is constructed from this material,
and the final cast made in bronze. These
bronze sections are placed together, and
the statue is completed.
The work on this statue may be ob
served between the hours of 5 and 6 p.m.
Mr. Paine and his assistant arc very glad
to explain the process to those interested-
