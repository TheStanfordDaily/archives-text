# THE 						SUMMER QUARTER
## 
### 
Unlike many universities, Stanford failed to
lapse into a temporary state of torpor during the
summer session, but went straight ahead with the
endowment and University expansion as if the reg
ular college year were going full blast.
The Board of Athletic Control has given a new
aspect to intercollegiate athletics by devoting profits
from athletic games to non-athletic university pro
jects. The beginning of the new dormitory this
.summer marks the Board's move as an actual
achievement. Like the stadium, Toyon Hall will
soon become a part of the University,, its signifi
cance shelved but the ideals promoting its inception
remaining as a foundation for further achievements.
It is said of Stanford people that they achieve and
then pass unconsciously on to the next task. In
such case, the new dormitory is typical of Stanford.
Encina Dining Hall, now being built simulta
neously with Toyon Hall, has at last been made
possible. Although the plans for these facilities are
ancient history, the summer quarter saw them being
put into effect.
The appointment of Dr. William Hulbert Barrow
to the office of Director of Physical Education de
serves a place by itself in these columns. The new
staff under a new organization will be directed by
Dr. Barrow, who has already shown on several occa
sions that his appointment was far from being a
mistake. Students are watching with interest the
early indications of an efficient as well as a suc
cessful year in Encina Gym.
The new $14,000 track in the stadium is another
product of the summer quarter not to be overlooked.
It would be foolish to describe it and the details of
its history. It's worth everyone's time to go down
and see for himself.
People who eat on the run may point to the sum
mer quarter of 1922 as the time when Stanford's
first real quick-lunch counter was installed. Handy,
neat, inexpensive, and clean, the new short-order
counter risen from the ruins of the Old Stanford
Union restaurant bids fair to be one of the most
valuable additions to Stanford's possessions this
year. Night hawks need no longer go to Palo Alto
for a cup of coffee or a wafflle. Busy people need
not wait for service. Tired people may spend a
few minutes comfortably lounging about the tables.
The quick-lunch will soon be a common meeting
place for Stanford people on the campus.
Summer sessions are called dry, tiresome, and
eventless. Student life sometimes is. But regard
less of the fact that the summer student may do
little more than study, loaf, and sleep, the University
is always awake and alive to its problems. The
authorities are always on the job.

It would be foolish to describe it and the details of
its history. It's worth everyone's time to go down
and see for himself.
People who eat on the run may point to the sum
mer quarter of 1922 as the time when Stanford's
first real quick-lunch counter was installed. Handy,
neat, inexpensive, and clean, the new short-order
counter risen from the ruins of the Old Stanford
Union restaurant bids fair to be one of the most
valuable additions to Stanford's possessions this
year. Night hawks need no longer go to Palo Alto
for a cup of coffee or a wafflle. Busy people need
not wait for service. Tired people may spend a
few minutes comfortably lounging about the tables.
The quick-lunch will soon be a common meeting
place for Stanford people on the campus.
Summer sessions are called dry, tiresome, and
eventless. Student life sometimes is. But regard
less of the fact that the summer student may do
little more than study, loaf, and sleep, the University
is always awake and alive to its problems. The
authorities are always on the job.
Unlike many universities, Stanford failed to
lapse into a temporary state of torpor during the
summer session, but went straight ahead with the
endowment and University expansion as if the reg
ular college year were going full blast.
The Board of Athletic Control has given a new
aspect to intercollegiate athletics by devoting profits
from athletic games to non-athletic university pro
jects. The beginning of the new dormitory this
.summer marks the Board's move as an actual
achievement. Like the stadium, Toyon Hall will
soon become a part of the University,, its signifi
cance shelved but the ideals promoting its inception
remaining as a foundation for further achievements.
It is said of Stanford people that they achieve and
then pass unconsciously on to the next task. In
such case, the new dormitory is typical of Stanford.
Encina Dining Hall, now being built simulta
neously with Toyon Hall, has at last been made
possible. Although the plans for these facilities are
ancient history, the summer quarter saw them being
put into effect.
The appointment of Dr. William Hulbert Barrow
to the office of Director of Physical Education de
serves a place by itself in these columns. The new
staff under a new organization will be directed by
Dr. Barrow, who has already shown on several occa
sions that his appointment was far from being a
mistake. Students are watching with interest the
early indications of an efficient as well as a suc
cessful year in Encina Gym.
The new $14,000 track in the stadium is another
product of the summer quarter not to be overlooked.
It would be foolish to describe it and the details of
its history. It's worth everyone's time to go down
