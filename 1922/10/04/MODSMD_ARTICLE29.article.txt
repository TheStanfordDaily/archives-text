# WHERE INCIDENTAL FEES GO
## 
### 
New students and often many of the old ones
wonder where the twenty-one dollars for incidentals
go after their disappear from student purses through
the Comptroller's window. And it is usually from
those who do not know that most of the criticism
against other assessments comes.
There is a University fee of ten dollars to pay
toward lighting and heating costs, a gymnasium fee
of five dollars to pay for instruction, building use,
laundry and other expenses, a Student Guild assess
ment of two dollars to care for ill or injured students,
a Men's Union or Women's Club fee of one dollar, a
charge of one dollar for the basketball pavilion, and
another of two dollars for the Associated Students
fund. The latter is divided among the Board of
Athletic Control for admission to games, the Daily
Palo Alto, and the student body itself.
During the fall quarter, the total admission costs
paid by students to all football games will be three
dollars and a half. The value will be at least ten
dollars. Charges for conference games arc not addi
tional assessments, nor are they nearly so high as
charges to the general public. There is at no time
any duplication of gate assessments. As a matter of
fact, students are admitted at one-third the regular
cost.
