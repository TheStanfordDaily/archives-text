A lot of sympathetic tears
Are spilled o'er Crusoe's lonesome years;
But did you ever stop to think
That he was quite a happy king?
No dress suit armor did he wear,
And when he wanted to, he'd swear
A right round oath, one good and brown,
With no female to call him down.
At night he'd come home when he'd choose 112
And never have to doff his shoes;
When he and Friday played at golf
No cops came around and shoed them off.
His little island never knew
The Volstead ban on high-power brew,
The income tax, immoral plays,
Pergdoll, or naval holidays.
He didn't have to dodge a Ford,
. Or guys who tell how Babe Ruth scored.
Despite these blessings that he had,
He was a discontented lad.
He stuck his shirt upon a pole,
And flew it from a lofty knoll.
At last a vessel hove in view,
And took him back home, P. D. Q.

In spite of what we've written here,
We wouldn't trade with him, we fear,
Which goes to show that journalism,
Is sometimes only theorism!

NO MORE BUSTED RESOLUTIONS!
All the good resolutions of summer are fled,
Not a one of the number has stuck in my head.
I'm back to the cigs, and I'm worse than before.
And I'm queening the co-eds as much —maybe more!
|
I'm not walking a foot where I'm able to ride,
And I'm hitting the movies a lot more, beside.
But for all of these problems I've found the
solutions,
And that is: Not to make any more resolutions!

throat. He is bleeding horribly. What shall I do? An

I— ARA PLANE.

Dear Ara: —
Tie a tourniquet of rope around neck between heart
and wound. Bleeding should stop in hour. If not,
write for further directions.

should never be taken except when unavoidable, and
thea cautiously. For remedies see any doctor.
