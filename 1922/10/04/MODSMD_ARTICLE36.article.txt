# EUROPEAN AQUATIC RULES STUDIED BY BRANDSTEN
## 
### 
Ernst Brandsten, Director of Aquatic
Sports, returned to Stanford Saturday
after a four months' trip to England,
France, Germany, and the Scandinavian
countries. The main purpose of his trip
was to investigate swimming conditions
throughout Europe and to develop senti
ment regarding the formation of new
international diving and swimming rules
for the next Olympic Games. He was
accompanied by his wife, who has charge
of women's swimming.
Brandsten's activities,Jiad the sanction
of the American Athletic Union. He
first visited England, where he conferred
with Mr. Eddington, president of the
Diving Association of England. The
English authorities were in hearty sym
pathy with the changes proposed by the
Cardinal mentor. The leading French
swimming authorities were on their way
to the United States when Brandsten ar
rived in Paris, but his investigation
showed that the French will more than
likely fall in line with England and the
United States in advancing swimming
and diving to a higher position and to
control it by rules that will be more ad
vantageous than those that have been
used for the last fifteen years. The
French authorities are advancing rapidly
in their work of making the 1924 Olvm

pic Games, which will take place in Paris,
a great success, according to Brandsten's
observations.
Germany has been holding numerous
swimming and diving contests since the
close of the war but it is still doubtful
whether they will be allowed to com
pete in the 1924 Olympic Games. Hans
Luber, champion of Germany in diving,
so far looks to be one of the best in
Europe in this sport, but Coach Brand
sten thinks that the Americans will take
first honors again, as they did in 1920.
Brandsten reports that the Scandi
navian countries —Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark—have been making progress in
aquatic work. He conferred with all the
leading authorities of these countries
and found their ideas to be about the
same as England.
Mr. Bergwell, manager of the stadium
at Stockholm, and one of the most in
fluential men of the swimming world,
has been appointed by the European of
ficials to draw up a new set of diving
regulations which will first be sent to
all the countries having swimming asso
ciations. Each country will suggest the
changes it desires to be made. The plans
suggested will then be acted upon by the
Olympic committee when the officials
meet in Paris.
