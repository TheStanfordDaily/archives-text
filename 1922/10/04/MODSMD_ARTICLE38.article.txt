# MARSHALL ED LAMB URGES RENOVATION OF CHIMNEY FLUES
## 
### 
Calling attention to the fact that most
of the recent fires about the University
have been caused by carelessness in re
spect to flues, Fire Marshal Ed Lamb
issued the following statement. He par
ticularly urges attention to this menace
in connection with the National hire
Prevention Day which is scheduled for
October 9:
"In the fall and early winter special
attention should be paid to stove pipes,
furnace pipes, smoke vents and flues.
Where these are of metal they frequent
ly rust, come apart or deteriorate during
the summer, and when fires are started
up in the fall, or they are put to a severe
test during the first very cold weather,
a blaze is likely to result.
"There is • special need of unusually
careful attention to flyies, smoke-pipes]
and heating apparatus generally this sea
son, because of the abnormal fuel condi
tions. Millions of householders will be
compelled to use soft coal who have
heretofore used hard coal, and the
change will necessarily introduce many
serious fire hazards, unless great carc is
taken to see that flues and smoke-pipes
are kept clear and that proper safeguards
are provided for the other dangers which
will develop.
"Fires due to faulty furnace pipes and
smoke-pipes have been unusually numer
ous this season, especially where there
was dampness. Where the surface was
already corroded by the heat and fumes,
the dampness soon rusted the metal so
that a pipe which looked all right on the
outside would collapse with the slightest
strain. The danger of such pipes in base
ments, often near wooden partitions and
ceilings, is evident, but only an inspec
tion would reveal the interior weakness.
"These warnings should be especially
emphatic as to dwellings, for basement
fires are apt to get under dangerous
headway before they are discovered, and
when they occur at night, life as well as
property is endangered. An ounce of
fire prevention is worth a pound of fire
extinguishment."
