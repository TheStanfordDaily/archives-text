WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.â€”The world
war brought home to the United States
in a very striking manner the advisa
bility of reasonable precaution, com
pletely vindicated the advocates of
military training and preliminary or
ganization and demonstrated beyond
question the fallacy of pacifisis* theo
ries, General Pershing declared today,
in an address here to the first conven
tion of the reserve officers' associa
tion.
i ( "These results were forced upon
us," Pershing said, "at the unneces
sary cost of valuable human life and
the lesson has sunk deeper in the
breasts of all save these few who,
having eyes, see not, and having ears
hear not."
