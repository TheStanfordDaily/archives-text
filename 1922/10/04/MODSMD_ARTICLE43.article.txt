# WENTZ PRESENTS OLD WRITINGS TO LIBRARY
## 
### 
Walter Y. Wentz, '06, has presented
the Library with an unusual collection of
palm leaf writings, which is now on ex
hibit in the case at the head of the main
stairway. The collection illustrates the
art of writing on ola (palm leaf) as
practiced in Ceylon, India, and adjacent
countries since time immemorial.
Mr. Wentz is now 011 his way back to
Oxford to continue his studies in com
parative religions. He was on the cam
pus during September, when he gave the
ola writings to the Library. He is the
author of "Fairy Faith of Celtic Coun
tries" and is a student of folk lore.
According to Mr. Wentz, ola writing
is still used extensively in some parts of
India. Almost all of the great Sanskrit
literature of India, including the Vedas,
Upanishads, Puranas, and other sacred
books of the Hindus and all of the canon
of Southern Buddhism in Pali have been
handed do\vn 011 the palm leaf manu
scripts of this kind.
The ola leaf of the Talipot palm is
bleached, dried, and smoothed when the
characters are engraved on it with a
sharp stylus. A preparation of oil and
lamp black is rubbed over the completed
folio and the result is almost non-perish
able.
One of the leaf books in the collection
contains the Digha Nikaya in Pali writ
ten by a Buddhist priest of Mahalle two
hundred years ago. The cover is hand
painted in colors with intricate geomet
rical patterns etched on. The Pali canon
of Southern Buddhism is contained in
three great collections similar to the
book exhibited—the Vinaya, consisting
chiefly of rules of the priesthood, the
Sutta, sei'mons of the Buddha, and the
Abhidhamma, the higher metaphysics or

teachings of the Buddha.
The collection contains an English
translation of the Samgiti Sutta shown.
An astrological book, such as every
farmer possesses, according to Mr.
Wentz, is fdled with sketches and in
structions for the cultivation of the
crops. These books are written in Sin
halese and are the absolute guides of the
farmers.
Besides the books on religion and agri
culture, the collection also contains a
stylus and samples of the ola leaf in
various stages of its preparation.
