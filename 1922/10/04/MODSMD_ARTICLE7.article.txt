# UNDERCLASS FIGHT PROMISES TO BE MIGHTY TUSSLE
## Kidnapping Strictly Banned; Infractions of Rules to Be Summarily Dealt With 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
The smoldering embers of another
class fight have been fanned. Riotous
enthusiasm, increasing crescendo-like
with a passage of time, was exhibited
as the wearers of the "dink" and the
wearers of the most questionable and
talked-of hat in the world, met in
respective sessions at 1 o'clock this
afternoon, to voice bloodthirstily to
the rest of the Stanford population
just what will happen to the other
belligerent party. "From 1 to 1:30
Frdiay morning and from 4:30 to 5
that afternoon, just you watch us,"
each shouted.
Responsible upperclassmen were
present and laid down the law, writ
ten and unwritten. The regulations
governing the scrimmage which were
drawn up by Philip F. Landis and a
committee of seven late yesterday aft
ernoon, and which were then passed on
by President Wilbur, were made clear
to the members of each of the con
flicting parties.
The freshmen go into the one and
only interclass fight of the col'ege
year with the odds slightly in their
favor from the point of actual mem
bers. What the '25 men lack in quan
tity, however, they declare they make
up in courageous quality, and with
tradition as a mighty force behind
them to "egg" them on, the Sears
ville plunge and the ensuing tie-up in
the afternoon ought to be a mass battle
well worth seeing. The footba l ] men
of both classes will be shelved during
the conflict.
In accordance with the rules drawn
up, both classes have agreed to refrain
from all hostile activity outside the
prescribed hours of fighting, and will
put all autos in seclusion until the
smoke of battle has blown over. The
notorious practice of kidnapping and
the confiscation of the captive's clothes
and B. V. D.'s, no matter how much
of a kick both parties may get out
of it, is severely frowned on.
For fear of creating a sudden de
mand for serum through the excess
indulgence, even though reluctantly,
of the internationally known Searsville
1120. which oftentimes causes sudden
outbreaks of typhoid, pneumonia, and
kindred aliments in our midst, a ban
has been clamped on this practice. The
pleasure which was possible not so
long ago when members uÂ£ The Tor
ture Squad used to gather at one of
the Old Town Pumps and assume vari
ous angles 011 their culprit's anatomy,
and expel all air from his interior,
while water took its place, is also
frowned on. "Everyone must be able
to breathe naturally at. all times dur
ing the progress of the fight, and if
at any moment anyone should get des
perately thirsty, he should leave his
name and address before leaving the
field to pursue in haste some form
of liquid refreshment."
Any exaggerated gusto 011 the part
of the belligerents such as the crown
ing with shilallahs, or the throwing
of hand grenades such as character
ized a recent Stanford class fight now
in history, is prohibited and the exe
cutors of such deeds will be readily
given trial and executed without any
unnecessary formality.
For fear that some time during the
zest and the heat of battle, a few
upperclassmen who are in charge of
their respective cohorts, become too
rambunctious and issue sharp com
mands which run in distinct contrast
to those laid down by Phil Landis and
his committee of seven, provision is
also made that they, too, may have
the permission of learning first-hand,
the astonishing things which the Men's
Council at Stanford is capable of do
ing in times of dire necessity.

When at last the freshmen have
been successful in taking a free slurge
and weekly hath, Friday morning, in
spite of the clamoring crowd, they are
advised to trot on home and put on
the finishing touches with a good old
Turkish towel, after which they should
climb into their pajamas and night
shirts and let the Sandman sprinkle
sand in their eyes. The tie-up Fri
day afternoon will be on dry land and
as much energy as it is possible to
muster together will be needed to
sling aside the advances of the am
bitious cohorts of Sophomore.
A complete list of the rules govern
ing the light is printed elsewhere in
this issue. All participants are urged
to become familiar with them at once.
