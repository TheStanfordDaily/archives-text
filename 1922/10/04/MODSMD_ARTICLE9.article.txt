# First "Stanford" Man Described By Willis in Current Cardinal
## 
### 
The first Stanford man lived rome
4000 years ago according to Dr. Bailey
Willis, in his article in this month's
issue of the Stanford Cardinal. Dr.
Willis discusses the history of the
skull which was found in a nearby
creek last spring in a half-humorous
half-scientific manner. The skull be
longs to a member of an ancient Indian
tribe, probably one of the first to cross
into this continent from Asia. These
people were shell mound dwellers â€”
that is their food consisted mainly of
mussels.
Other skulls very similar to this
one have been found in various other
parts of California and there are sev
eral of them in the Geology Depart
ment of the University of California.
The Stanford skull attracted special
attention only because of the peculiar
manner in which it was found.
An anonymous article in the Cardi
nal criticizes the methods used in
modern American universities. The
author speaks ironically of the stan
dard product turned out by the pres
ent school system. He brings out
his idea by supposing that he quotes
the circular of a university in which
all these errors are held up as ad
vantages.
