UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
October 5. (P. I. N. S.) â€”Discovery
that the hillside where the stadium
will be built was of a sedimentary
formation rather than hard rock has
removed the final and most import
ant difficulty which faced the stadium
committee.
Professors Andrew Lawson and John
Buwalda, heads of the geology depart
ment, gave an opinion some time ago
that the entire hill by Strawberry
Canyon was of shale composition.
This statement has been verified by
fc the drift shaft which goes back into
the hill for a distance of over a hun
dred feet.
Had the test ehaft revealed hard
rock strata, the approximate cost of
excavation for the bowl would have
been about three million dollars.
The stadium committee originally
planned for the total cost of building
the structure to the approximately
$500,000.
Because of the uncertainty concern
ing the ground structure, actual work
on the stadium has been held up for
several weeks.
