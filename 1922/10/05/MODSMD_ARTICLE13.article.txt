# NEW SYSTEM WILL HAVE FIRST TRIAL IN OLYMPIC GAME
## Bob Evans, ex-"Card" Coach, Has Former College Stars On Winged "O" Eleven 
### 
What is going to happen when
"Fighting Bob" Evans, whose Cardinal
varsity of 1919 came within three
sixteenths of an inch of beating Cali
fornia, runs up against the Warner
system, next Saturday?
Evans undoubtedly "knows his stuff"
as well as any mentor on the Pacific
slope, but welding together a motley
crowd, whose football was learned in
fifty-seven different places, is no
cinch. Kerr and Thornhill, on the
l other hand, have been pounding the
Warner style of play into the varsity
squad for three weeks.â€ž
* There are few coaches who wouldn't
trade twenty players, with a cash
balance, for the outfit now playing
for Evans. "Rabbit" Bradsliaw, who
i needs onlv a center by way of a sup-
I porting cast, was a terror on the Ne
| vada Sagebrusliers for three years,
t What he will do with a real line in
j front of him no one knows. He may go
| through for several touchdowns, or
i then again, it may seem so strange
with some good players back of him,
j that he may do nothing.
The order of things has changed
1 quite a bit since that 14-10 battle
| three years ago. Evans, instead of
l sitting on the Stanford bench, will
I be on the other side of the field. Cort
Majors, who held down a guard posi
tion on the Bruin eleven in the 1919
contest, will be in the Olympic Line.
"Dink" Templeton, whose kicking was
a factor in the Cardinal showing, will
watch the game as track coach, while
Patrick, who bucked Stanford to what
seemed a last-minute victory, will prob
ably start at fullback for the Winged
"O."
Then Evans has Latham, ex-skipper
of last year's Blue and Gold "wonder
team," who will snap the ball from
center; King, whose drop-kicking for
the Navy beat the Army, 6 to 0, in a
rain and*mud battle two years ago;
Daly, who has been with the Olympics
several seasons. King and Daly play
the tackle positions, while Swan of
Berkeley High, Larson, end for Van
Gent's team last year, and Hauser
from Ohio, are in line for the ends.
Guessing the Cardinal line up or the
kind of showing Kerr's men will make
is about as futile predicting who will
win the Big Game in 1956. One thing
is certain, however. The Cards will
know just as many offensive and de
fensive plays as do the Olympics, and
if the line stands up as expected, Wil
cox, Cuddeback et. al., are going to
score at least once.
Kerr has been holding "skull" prac
tice for the first squad in the evening,
and yesterday afternoon he gave them
a test to see how much they had
learned. Lining the team up in vari
ous parts of the field he called the
down and yards to go, and each man
moved to his specified position.
There was little activity at the stadi
um last night, outside of the usual
rudimentary practice, and some prac
tice in getting off kicks, with Wilcox
doing the booting. Campbell was back
at quarter, with Doughty at halfback

in place of Murray, whose injured leg
is still a litttle weak.
This afternoon Kerr pitted his men
against the grays in the final strenu
ous practice before the Olympic tussle.
Tomorrow there "will be light practice.
There is practically no chance of
either Douglass or Hartranft getting
into the game, so Taylor will act as
relief man for Cuddeback.
