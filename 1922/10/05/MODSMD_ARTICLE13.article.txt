# NEW SYSTEM WILL HAVE FIRST TRIAL IN OLYMPIC GAME
## Bob Evans, ex-"Card" Coach, Has Former College Stars On Winged "O" Eleven 
### 
What is going to happen when
"Fighting Bob" Evans, whose Cardinal
varsity of 1919 came within three
sixteenths of an inch of beating Cali
fornia, runs up against the Warner
system, next Saturday?
Evans undoubtedly "knows his stuff"
as well as any mentor on the Pacific
slope, but welding together a motley
crowd, whose football was learned in
fifty-seven different places, is no
cinch. Kerr and Thornhill, on the
l other hand, have been pounding the
Warner style of play into the varsity
squad for three weeks.â€ž
* There are few coaches who wouldn't
trade twenty players, with a cash
balance, for the outfit now playing
for Evans. "Rabbit" Bradsliaw, who
i needs onlv a center by way of a sup-
I porting cast, was a terror on the Ne
| vada Sagebrusliers for three years,
t What he will do with a real line in
j front of him no one knows. He may go
| through for several touchdowns, or
i then again, it may seem so strange
with some good players back of him,
j that he may do nothing.
The order of things has changed
1 quite a bit since that 14-10 battle
| three years ago. Evans, instead of
l sitting on the Stanford bench, will
I be on the other side of the field. Cort
