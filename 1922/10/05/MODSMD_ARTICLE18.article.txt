# Wilbur Tells Campus Situation to Students In Welcome Assembly
## 
### 
President Wilbur in his address at the first student assembly of the year this
morning, which was designed primarily for new students at Stanford, outlined the
present situation and the future of the University, calling attention to the new
buildings under way, the progress of the endowment campaign in which $1,050,000
has been secured, and the campaigns for the second and third millions are being
instituted, noted $200,000 in gifts that have come to the University recently, and
dwelt somewhat upon the problems of the endowed university. "The educational
future of America depends upon the maintenance of parallel systems of education
supported by the state and by private gifts," said Dr. Wilbur. "So long as we
have this scheme of higher training, there will be no danger of our entire educa-

tional world being dominated by one
policy or being utilized to serve the in
terests of any party, group or organiza
tion."
Although freshmen are practically im
mune to advice by the time they register,
President Wilbur gave the new students
a few general suggestions.
"Be a good citizen here," he advised,
"and you'll be the man or woman the
world needs. What you do here lives
with you. These are the people you will
know all your life. If you get a reputa
tion now as foul-mouthed, dissipated,
lazy, unbalanced, it will hang with you
in the minds of many people for the rest
of your days. The contrary* is even
more true."
Outside activities, one of the most im
portant parts of student life, are not for
all, Dr. Wilbur believes. Some students
have no margin of time and energy for
activities after they have prepared their
class work. His advice to freshmen is
to do the essential thing first and then
go out for activities.
Speaking of "campus roads" Doctor
Wilbur said: "You are on a broad
straight campus highway full of many
obstacles, but well charted and well
traveled, which leads up to the plat
foil* where you should stand some
day to receive a bit of parchment
bound in red." But this highway has
many edge roads which the new stu
dent is likely to take; among these
the speaker described:
BAD START ROUTE. A popular
road for the new student who does
not get dowii to business from the
first day. Easy to travel but return
trip weary and full of excuses.
PUT-OFF ROUTE. Traveled by
those who think in terms of tomorrow.
AIMLESS ROUTE. This roau looks
like a maze and it's hard to steer along
it, but it reaches the edge surprising
ly fast. No guide can help the travel
er because he does not know where
he is going.
BOOTLEG ROUTE. Short road to
edge, often with a big spill at the
end. May lead to moral death.
IDLERS' ROAD. Often traveled in
pairs. One usually turns back before
the edge is reached.
POOR HEALTH AVENUE. (Bad
habits —eating at odd times —no exer
cise—not enough sleep). Stop at the
sign of the Medical Adviser.
WRONG ROAD. Some take it and

never return. Others manage to get
back. It begins anywhere, but always
ends at the edge.
RUBBISH ROAD. Littered with
trashy literature. Much time spent
here on foolish, sloppy or inane movies
and idle campus rumor.
HIGH SPEED EOULEVARI). Leads
directly off the campus. More roads
off than back. Full of time wasters.
Mortality of travelers very high.

Outside activities, one of the most im
portant parts of student life, are not for
all, Dr. Wilbur believes. Some students
have no margin of time and energy for
activities after they have prepared their
class work. His advice to freshmen is
to do the essential thing first and then
go out for activities.
Speaking of "campus roads" Doctor
Wilbur said: "You are on a broad
straight campus highway full of many
obstacles, but well charted and well
traveled, which leads up to the plat
foil* where you should stand some
day to receive a bit of parchment
bound in red." But this highway has
many edge roads which the new stu
dent is likely to take; among these
the speaker described:
BAD START ROUTE. A popular
road for the new student who does
not get dowii to business from the
first day. Easy to travel but return
trip weary and full of excuses.
PUT-OFF ROUTE. Traveled by
those who think in terms of tomorrow.
AIMLESS ROUTE. This roau looks
like a maze and it's hard to steer along
it, but it reaches the edge surprising
ly fast. No guide can help the travel
er because he does not know where
he is going.
BOOTLEG ROUTE. Short road to
edge, often with a big spill at the
end. May lead to moral death.
IDLERS' ROAD. Often traveled in
pairs. One usually turns back before
the edge is reached.
POOR HEALTH AVENUE. (Bad
habits —eating at odd times —no exer
cise—not enough sleep). Stop at the
sign of the Medical Adviser.
WRONG ROAD. Some take it and

never return. Others manage to get
back. It begins anywhere, but always
ends at the edge.
RUBBISH ROAD. Littered with
trashy literature. Much time spent
here on foolish, sloppy or inane movies
and idle campus rumor.
HIGH SPEED EOULEVARI). Leads
directly off the campus. More roads
off than back. Full of time wasters.
Mortality of travelers very high.
President Wilbur in his address at the first student assembly of the year this
morning, which was designed primarily for new students at Stanford, outlined the
present situation and the future of the University, calling attention to the new
buildings under way, the progress of the endowment campaign in which $1,050,000
has been secured, and the campaigns for the second and third millions are being
instituted, noted $200,000 in gifts that have come to the University recently, and
dwelt somewhat upon the problems of the endowed university. "The educational
future of America depends upon the maintenance of parallel systems of education
supported by the state and by private gifts," said Dr. Wilbur. "So long as we
have this scheme of higher training, there will be no danger of our entire educa-

tional world being dominated by one
policy or being utilized to serve the in
terests of any party, group or organiza
tion."
Although freshmen are practically im
mune to advice by the time they register,
President Wilbur gave the new students
a few general suggestions.
"Be a good citizen here," he advised,
"and you'll be the man or woman the
world needs. What you do here lives
with you. These are the people you will
know all your life. If you get a reputa
tion now as foul-mouthed, dissipated,
lazy, unbalanced, it will hang with you
in the minds of many people for the rest
of your days. The contrary* is even
more true."
