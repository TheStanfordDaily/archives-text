SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. s.â€”Postal
authorities today attributed to a black
mailer and not to any organized gang,
authorship of a series of four letters,
signed "K. K.," received by G. K. King,
Red Bluff capitalist, demanding payment
of $20,000 immediately on pain of death.
The letters were turned over to pos
tal authorities here by a detective agency
which King had engaged to run down
the affair.
Two others are said to have received
similar letters demanding money.
