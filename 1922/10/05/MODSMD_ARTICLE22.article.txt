# STANFORD MAY GET INTERCOLLEGIATE POLO TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Plans are beiug negotiated for a
polo tournament between the Stan
ford R. O. T. C. and the units at Colo
rado Agricultural College and Oregon
Agricultural College, to be played here
about Thanksgiving, is the report at
the Military Science Headquarters.
According to Captain Boyle, who lias
charge of the sport, this is the most
ambitious undertaking the department
has yet attempted, and if it can be
accomplished will be a credit not only
to the department but to thfc univer
sity. It would probably mean the
transportation of the polo ponies as
well as the team.
With all members of last year's
varsity back, and a bigger squad of
candidates turning out than ever be
fore, Stanford prospects are bright.
The new polo field by the highway is
now completed and is in use. Yester
day afternoon saw the first mallet
swingers in action. The old R. O. T. C.
headquarters by the,football field, hav
ing been relinquished for the new of
fices east of the Encina Gymnasium,
have been removed to the polo
grounds, and will be used as a club
house and grand stand.
There has recently been a great,
growth of interest in polo. The R. O.
T. C. cavalry camp held at Del Monte
last summer had tournaments as a
part of the curriculum.
