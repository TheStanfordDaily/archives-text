# THE 						COAST CONFERENCE RACKET
## 
### 
Judging by the verbal barrage thrown up by
Pacific Coast Conference officials because Stanford
has exercised her right to schedule her own game in
her own stadium, it must be considerable of a crime
to take care of one's own business. And when an
institution does this without violating in any way its
agreements and still lias six or seven official fingers
of scorn shoved under its nose, it is a fair indication
that somebody's toes are being stepped on. It prob
ably will not be necessary to make a mailed fist of
the fingers to cause Stanford to free herself from
responsibility to her critics.
The identity of the owner of the crushed toes is
not definitely known. One may get a faint idea
about the matter, however, by considering the fol
lowing high points in the history of the Coast Con
ference for the past two months:
In August. Stanford refused to represent the West
at Pasadena, if •:ed, and granted the Conference
permission to use Stanford Stadium, unless she had
a game of her own.« The Conference was unable to
come to definite terms with the Tournament of
Roses committee for the Pasadena game. Before
scheduling the game with Pitt, Stanford officials
were told by the Conference that no arrangements
were being made for an East-West game. The Con
ference then took a telegraph vote to see how black
the members considered Stanford's eye. ft must
have been pretty dark because Stanford was re
quested not to play her own game in her own
stadium, presumably because some other team
needed the honor. Or perhaps it was the money.
If it was neither of these, then Pasadena is not en
tirely ignorant of the source of hostility to the Card-
Pitt contest.
Whatever may be the outcome of this wild outcry
over a university's personal affairs, the Board of
Athletic Control and Dr. W. 11. Barrow deserve the
united support of all Stanford. They have con
ducted the Stanford part of the program in a highly
creditable manner and will leave the University in a
good light in the public eye. anti-Stanford publicity
to the contrary. Whether it is football, debating or
scholarship, Stanford always plays her own game.
She is able to care for herself.
