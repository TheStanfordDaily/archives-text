# THE 						NEW COACHING STAFF

### 
Don't glad-hand him to death while he is busy
building the foundation for Stanford's greatest
eleven, but on the other hand, don't miss an oppor
tunity to meet Andy Kerr, the most affable of Coast
Conference coaches. He prefers that nobody sing
his praises until he has definitely proved the first
impression he creates —that he is a world-beater,
l>oth as a man to meet and as a Stanford coach. It
is not for us to predict football victories so soon, but
one short month's acquaintance with Andy Kerr has
given several Stanford men the impression that the
Board of Control has chosen the man we've been
looking for.

Claude Thorn hill has been here long enough to
escape editorial comment until his big linesmen plow
so many holes in the opposition that the hallelujah
streak in us refuses to stay under cover. It is the
unanimous hope of football men that "Tiny" stays
with Stanford till the cows come home. They have
reason to. An honest-to-football line seems now
assured.
"Husky" Hunt will be a surpise to a good many
Stanford people. lli> name like "Tinv's" is the
product of wit. but his football methods might be
characterized by that title without raising a smile,
lie has taken a light, inexperienced group of fresh
man linesmen and has made them almost the equal of
a star backfield. Press agent stuff this summer indi
cated that he would have a squad of young giants.
The giants never came and so "Husky" Hunt has
gone to work with the little candidates and has made
them giants of intellect.
As the Pictorial cartoonist has put it. "Red" is one
of the best Betts on the campus. Under his tutelage,
the goofs ought to clean up the lot with their op
ponents this fall unless Andv Kerr takes all the good
ones for himself. He has already robbed "Red" of
three or four good ones.
A. E. Post hasn't much to say off the turf, but
certain freshmen linesmen admit that he can sav

things' in more ways than one as assistant to Hunt.
He was instrumental in making the Berkeley High
School team a champion eleven last year under 1 lunt.
lie doesn't seem to have forgotten anything since
then .and judging by the way things more on the
freshman field, he is showing even more this season.
"Dink" Templeton was referred to by a certain
Washington paper two years ago as the "Stanford
punter who made the Washington safety fumble In
kicking the ball so high it was slick with snow."
"Dink" may not be able to make his proteges deliver
snow to the opposition's front door this year, but he
will certainly produce a couple of kickers who will
surpass the average college back.
Be they ever so many, coaches are not enough to
win football games. And realizing this, Stanford
has availed herself of the services of Wallace Denny,
whose grin is a yard wide. Although it is sly at
times, it is generally admitted that that same grin is
also all wool. Denny has spent years with "Pop"'
Warner and certainly knows how to subdue sore
spots.
Tradition has it that Indians are silent and stoical
Denny may be stoical, but Stanford people will miss
the time of their lives if they fail to have a social chat
with the new trainer.

times, it is generally admitted that that same grin is
also all wool. Denny has spent years with "Pop"'
Warner and certainly knows how to subdue sore
spots.
Tradition has it that Indians are silent and stoical
Denny may be stoical, but Stanford people will miss
the time of their lives if they fail to have a social chat
with the new trainer.
Don't glad-hand him to death while he is busy
building the foundation for Stanford's greatest
eleven, but on the other hand, don't miss an oppor
tunity to meet Andy Kerr, the most affable of Coast
Conference coaches. He prefers that nobody sing
his praises until he has definitely proved the first
impression he creates —that he is a world-beater,
l>oth as a man to meet and as a Stanford coach. It
is not for us to predict football victories so soon, but
one short month's acquaintance with Andy Kerr has
given several Stanford men the impression that the
Board of Control has chosen the man we've been
looking for.

Claude Thorn hill has been here long enough to
escape editorial comment until his big linesmen plow
so many holes in the opposition that the hallelujah
streak in us refuses to stay under cover. It is the
unanimous hope of football men that "Tiny" stays
with Stanford till the cows come home. They have
reason to. An honest-to-football line seems now
assured.
"Husky" Hunt will be a surpise to a good many
Stanford people. lli> name like "Tinv's" is the
product of wit. but his football methods might be
characterized by that title without raising a smile,
lie has taken a light, inexperienced group of fresh
man linesmen and has made them almost the equal of
a star backfield. Press agent stuff this summer indi
cated that he would have a squad of young giants.
The giants never came and so "Husky" Hunt has
gone to work with the little candidates and has made
them giants of intellect.
As the Pictorial cartoonist has put it. "Red" is one
of the best Betts on the campus. Under his tutelage,
the goofs ought to clean up the lot with their op
ponents this fall unless Andv Kerr takes all the good
ones for himself. He has already robbed "Red" of
three or four good ones.
A. E. Post hasn't much to say off the turf, but
certain freshmen linesmen admit that he can sav

things' in more ways than one as assistant to Hunt.
He was instrumental in making the Berkeley High
School team a champion eleven last year under 1 lunt.
lie doesn't seem to have forgotten anything since
then .and judging by the way things more on the
freshman field, he is showing even more this season.
"Dink" Templeton was referred to by a certain
Washington paper two years ago as the "Stanford
punter who made the Washington safety fumble In
kicking the ball so high it was slick with snow."
"Dink" may not be able to make his proteges deliver
snow to the opposition's front door this year, but he
will certainly produce a couple of kickers who will
surpass the average college back.
Be they ever so many, coaches are not enough to
win football games. And realizing this, Stanford
has availed herself of the services of Wallace Denny,
whose grin is a yard wide. Although it is sly at
times, it is generally admitted that that same grin is
also all wool. Denny has spent years with "Pop"'
Warner and certainly knows how to subdue sore
