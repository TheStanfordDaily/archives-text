NEW YORK, Oct. s.â€”The grand old
dope is all upset.
The Giants are one up on the Yankees
and have battered the ace of Miller Hug
gins' hurling corps into submission.
The odds that favored the American
League champions to reverse last year's
decision and trample over the McGraw
clan to a world's championship, slight a*>
they were, have been proved unfounded.
By heating the Yanks 3 to 2 yesterday
in the opening game of the 1922 classic,
the Giants proved themselves once more
the truly great ball club that was there
in a pinch. Turned back inning after
inning by the blinding speed of "Bullet
Joe" Bush, McGraw's men climbed out
of their tracks in the eighth inning, and
with clattering bats that stung the best
offerings of the Yank star to all parts of
the field, took the all-important first
game before Waite Hoyt could be
rushed to the rescue.
The series is far from over and with
fair skies and another Indian summer
day promised for this afternoon, the
Hugmen will be out there scrapping
tooth and nail to even up matters.
Bob Shawkey undoubtedly will be on
the hill for the Yanks, who will be the
"home team" this afternoon. Bob has
a fine ball game in his system and if he
uncorks it this afternoon, the Giant ar
tillery may find even more trouble with
his'slants than they tmcountered in the
early innings of yesterday's curtain
raiser.
Scott or McQuillan are the probabili
ties for the National Leaguers.
Strategy of the old master, John Mc-
Graw, who sent his boys in to play the
hit-and-run, which has won so many
championships for the Giants, finally
conquered Bush.
It was just the tactics to employ
against the Yank "ace" yesterday. On
another occasion, with the nervousness
that he kept well concealed behind a
poker smile somewhat rubbed off by
anger at his defeat, "Bullet Joe" may
well the Giants to a shutout.
The Giants yesterday kept right after
Bush until they got him. They were
cracking away at that fast one, and al
though they hit >into the staunch Yankee
infield most frequently during the early
innings, they finally hit 'em where they
weren't.
