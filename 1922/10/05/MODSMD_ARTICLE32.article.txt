# VETERANS BACK FOR MINOR SPORT TEAMS
## 
### 
Minor sports, under the coaching of
Harry Maloney, are off for the fall
quarter with a registration of 318, in
cluding varsity tryoutees and compulsory
physical training.
Boxing leads the list in popularity with
107 men signed. Prospects for the Card
inal boxing team are excellent, five vet
erans <if last year's slugging program be
ing anxious for more punishment.
Jimmy Ross, veteran lightweight, has
already signed, together with Johnny
Lane, Bill Burkhart, and Ken Shipp.
Floyd 'full, heavyweight, is on the foot
ball squad at present, but will don the
leather pillows in time for the California
meet. b
Ross had an unusually bright year in
1921-22. and there is reason why he
should not repeat. He defeated Einzig
in the California meet, but was unable
to compete against U. S. C. as the Tro
jans had no man in his weight class.
Lane, in the 145-pound class, disposed
of Fairbanks in the U. S. C. meet, and
is out for more scalps this year, while
Bill Burkhart. who defeated Walter Bills
in a gory assault last year, will add to
his honors. Shipp was defeated in only
one match last season, and looks better
than ever.
Wrestling has thus far attracted only
forty-one entrants, but include three of
the old reliables. Captain Vaughn Hose
pian won his matches against California
and U. S. C. after rubbing "Bevo" Bail
ard's shoulders on the mat in the try
outs. McKee's greatest achievement was
holding the wrestling instructor at the
University of Southern California to a
draw in Los Angeles last spring. Sturm
will be back to support the 118-pound
class.
The fencing team, which defeated
California last year, has Gardner, Lewis,
Sandretto, and Monalo for a nucleus.
With a total of twenty-five registered in
the sport another winning team is prob
able. The season will open in San
Francisco, October 9, when Stanford en
ters a tournament sponsored by the Na
tional Amateur Fencers' League of
America.
The gymnasium team has Snedden,
Wilbur, /md Harris to build onâ€”all
point winners in last year's victory over
California. Thirty-six men are trying
for the team.
Handball comes second to boxing in
attraction, with 106 men registered. An
intramural tournament will probably be
held later, but plans are delayed until
the arrival of C. W. Davis, the new in
tramural director, on October 15.
