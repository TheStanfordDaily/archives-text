### (By United Press 
CHICAGO. Oct. s.â€”Railroad shop
men today went over Attorney General
Daugherty's head and asked the federal
court here to issue an order urging the
circuit judges to review the Daugherty
injunction immediately.
Donald R. Richberg, attorney for the
shopmen, read the appeal to the court.
The attorney declared that under the
law of 1903 the attorney general could
inform the circuit judges that the mat
ter was of "general public interest" and
thereby obtain an immediate hearing.
