NEW YORK, Oct. 5. —Without try
ing to detract from the class of the
Giants, it can be said that they had
all the edge on the breaks in the first
game. The Yankees are at a slight
disadvantage now but we are still con
fident that we will win the series.
Bob Shawkey is ready to pitch and
he will be an effective hurler against
the Giants. If he is in real form he
will win today and tie up the series.
Joe Bush was charge with yester
day's defeat and he certainly did not
deserve to lose. No one could wish
for a more perfectly pitched game.
With any kind of luck he would have
won by a shutout.
One of the many breaks and the
most important one happened in the

eighth inning when the bases were
filled and Emil Meusel bounced a
single to center off Bush's glove. I
probably will be censured for not re
moving Bush before I did. When the
bases were filled and Meusel hit that
bounder it was within an inch of a
double play and that was our only
hope of getting out of tho hole.
1 didn't take Bush out in that pinch
because I felt sure that he was able
to get out of it, as he had done in the
previous innings. He had a batter in
front of him who had not been able
to get anything off him. The record
shows that Meusel fouled to Sc.hang
in the first, grounded to Scott in the
fourth and fanned in the sixth.
As it was, perhaps I made the mis
take of having Bush try for a strike
on the first pitch to Meusel. He was
expecting it and was all set.

There were other breaks that went
badly for the Yanks. Young's miracul
ous catch for a double play in the fifth
inning was one. Bancroft robbed Bush
of two hits by sensational catches
and other stunts were pulled on the
field that were almost disheartening.
Everyone who saw that game will
back me up when I say that the Yanks
did not curl up at the finish. We
deserved to win. We played errorless
ball and fought all the breaks. We
were beaten but not outclassed.
I do not expect to see any one-sided
scores in this series as the pitching
is going to be too good.

bases were filled and Meusel hit that
bounder it was within an inch of a
double play and that was our only
hope of getting out of tho hole.
1 didn't take Bush out in that pinch
because I felt sure that he was able
to get out of it, as he had done in the
previous innings. He had a batter in
front of him who had not been able
to get anything off him. The record
shows that Meusel fouled to Sc.hang
in the first, grounded to Scott in the
fourth and fanned in the sixth.
As it was, perhaps I made the mis
take of having Bush try for a strike
on the first pitch to Meusel. He was
expecting it and was all set.

There were other breaks that went
badly for the Yanks. Young's miracul
ous catch for a double play in the fifth
inning was one. Bancroft robbed Bush
of two hits by sensational catches
and other stunts were pulled on the
field that were almost disheartening.
Everyone who saw that game will
back me up when I say that the Yanks
did not curl up at the finish. We
deserved to win. We played errorless
ball and fought all the breaks. We
were beaten but not outclassed.
I do not expect to see any one-sided
scores in this series as the pitching
is going to be too good.
