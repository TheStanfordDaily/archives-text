NEW YORK, Oct. 5.â€”A demand for
reduction in the wages of railroad em
ployees and a cut in railroad rates was
made by the economic policy committee
of the American Bankers' Association at
the association's convention here today.
The report expressed strong opposi
tion to the soldier bonus. It advocates
the repeal of those sections of the ship
ping laws which "make it impossible for
American shipowners to compete on
an equal basis with other countries."
The belief is frequently expressed that
with the industries of the nation no
longer hampered by nationwide strikes
and with business conditions continuing
their steady progress toward normal, the
country is nearing v the most prosperous
period since the days of war-time in
flation.
