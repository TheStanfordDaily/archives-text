# BELLIGERENTS ALL SET FOR ANNUAL SEARSVILLE FIGHT
## Both Factions Are Quiet In Spite of Intense Rivalry Existing; Battle to Rage 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Only held back by taut leashes
which served to increase their anxie
ty and enthusiasm, the rival fresh
men and sophomore classes early this
afternoon awaited the 4 o'clock gong
and the advent of another class fight
into Stanford's already colorful pages.
With precedence to back us, we can
safely say that when tradition released
the ropes which h°ld the adversaries
at arms' end, the rivals rushed at one
another with great gusto and began
the compounding of a mixture called
goulash. This has probably already
occurred or it may be happening at
this moment, but the Ouija, the radio,
and other news relaters would not
take the responsibility to inform us
just what would happen. And the
Gosh and Bygosh Press is closed for
repairs.
Ever since the rival classes met in
their respective session at 1 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, the tense feeling
which usually precedes such struggles
of momentous importance, began to
make itself felt. Small groups of
would-be conspirators gathered at
random on varieus parts of the Quad
and were dispersed only by the inter
vention of upperclassmen.
Last night's atmosphere was even
more tense, for sophomore and fresli-1
man lived together, supposedly peace
ful and friends then, —but enemies
now. Those who feared that one of
the last "red-blooded" traditions which
Stanford possessed, would be abolish
ed, awaited anxiously for any reports
which would indicate that any of the
rules and regulation governing the
fight had been violated.
But night passes without mishap
and without serious disturbance save
the warning by '23 and '24 to under
classmen when the latter's l'uces wore
too hard and sinister expressions.
"Thinking of such deeds may result,
in serious consequences," so they said.
"Key down until the morrow."
College life dragged this morning
and the faces of the freshmen as they
rambled on home to lunch might be
translated £ls something resembling
fear mingled with resentment.
At press time, eager noses were
seen rummaging around in ash cans,
old carpet bags, basements, attics,
privately owned trunks, and those
owned by others, for the whereabouts
of fighting equipment in which to
clothe themselves as units in the
fighting machines. The found cloth
ing seemed to indicate that they were
intended to be used merely as make
shifts as they looked as if any provo
cation either by wear, tear, mud, or
Searsville, would cause an almost im
med.ate demolition.
The following dispatches have been
received by Gosh and Bygosh Press
which reports that its press has been
repaired:
"4:31 p.m.—The members of the
contesting factions in what is consi
dered one of the most imposing class
strifes in history have one and all
declared to have at each other. This
is considered quite the usual thing
and more along the line of verbal com
bat is expected before the actual fight
ing begins.
"5 p.m.—Cedric Percival Links,
Gosh and Bygosh staff reporter, was
seriously injured, probably fatally,
when he was attacked by an angry
mob of the '26 contestants in front
of the United States Post Office at
Stanford "University, today. Links
was detailed to station himself on
top of the flag staff so as to watch
all operations, but since the pole had
been jemoved he was obliged to fall
into the hands of the frenzied fresh
men. 'We thought he was sopho
more,' declared the ring leader of the
gang.
"7 p.m.—The conditions in all sec
tors, especially along the Row and in
the Halls is unusually quiet. Mouth
to-mouth talk and back-talk is being
conducted in both camps. Both class
es seem ready for the conflict in the
early morning.
"8:00 p.m.—All's well."
