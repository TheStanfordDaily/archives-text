Sons of plutocrats and potentates
who ostentatiously perambulate down
the college avenues in their Fierce-
Arrows, Pa kards, Marmons, and
Fords, are much more numerous than
the poor professor who paddles up
Palm Drive 011 his Ranger. It is with
a great deal of pleasure that the
"prof" is grazed from time to time
by some of his victims at the wheel
of a Cadillac or Locomobile.
In front of the Quad at the hour of
2 p.m., there were fifty autos, includ
ing Fords, and twenty-four bicycles.
Four foot-power carriages were count
ed in front of the book store to nine
horseless carriages. Nineteen autos
surounded the library, against four of
the professors' steeds. The ratio at
the % Union was sixteen to three in
favor of the plutocrats. It appears
that soon the noble bicycle will pass
into oblivion in company with the
dinosaur, ptlectron, and great auk.
