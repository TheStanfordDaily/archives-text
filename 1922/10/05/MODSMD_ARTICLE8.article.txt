# Upperclassmen Have More of Youth's Enthusiasm Than Freshmen, Say Professors
## 
### 
Is the average freshman student more
enthusiastic, more willing, less blase, and
more teachable than the run of other
undergraduates? The consensus of opin
ion of representative professors from all
departments seems to favor the nega
tive.
Of twelve professors interviewed two
declined to express an opinion, nine pre
ferred to teach upperclassmen, and only
one remained to do the poor frosh rev
erence.
The majority denied that the older
student became blase. They claimed in
stead that as his years of study increased
he became more and more enthusiastic
in his chosen field, or more "wrapt in
his work," as one professor put it.
The freshman can be interested in
anything, for it is all new to himâ€”a
great adventure; but it is the trained
mind with a background of experience
that most appeals to the professor.
Some pointed out that the student of
eastern universities was more apt to be
come "fed up" with life in general,
studies in particular, than is his western
brother.
One professor, however, said that the
older a person becomes the less fascinat
ing things are apt to appear to him. Life
has given him nearly all that it will of
excitement, and no longer seems the
great adventure it once was. For that
reason this educator preferred to in
struct classes of freshmen, whose inter
ests were easily stimulated, and who
were unspoiled, and plastic.
In general it seemed to be the opinion
that the freshman's keen enthusiasm be
cause of the newness of everything, is
replaced, usually, by the more stimulat
ing enthusiasm of understanding and
consequent interest.
