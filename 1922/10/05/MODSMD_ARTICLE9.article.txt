NEW YORK, Oct. 5. (Special
Dispatch)— Bob Shawkey, Hug
gins' "second best," and Jess
Barnes, the veteran Giant curve
ball artist, went at each other
for three hours this afternoon
and when darkness closed in,
at the end of the tenth, the
teams were deadlocked, 3 to 3.
It was the first time in many
years of world series history
that the combatants failed to
come to a decision.
McGraw's men started with a
rush, as if to repeat their vic
tory of yesterday, and staked
Barnes to a three-run lead in the
first inning. The Yank wreck
ing crew kept poking Barnes,
however, shoving over runts in
the first, fourth and eighth.
Both Shawkey and Barnes al
lowed eight hits, with the Giants
debited with one error.
The score by innings:
Giants: —
300000000 o—3 8 1
Yanks: —
1001000 1 0 o—3 8 0
Batteries: — Giants, Barnes
and Snyder; Yanks, Shawkey
and Schang.
