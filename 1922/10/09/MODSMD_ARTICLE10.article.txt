# FRESHMAN MACHINE TAKES EASY VICTORY FROM LONG BEACH
## 
### Phil Newell, '24 
As a freshman team, this bunch that
"Husky" Hunt has in charge is an un
qualified success.
In their first play together on Satur
day, the yearlings methodically wiped up
the stadium with Long Beach high school,
to the lively tunc of 41-0. In the morn
ing the second team —or maybe it was
the third—ran through the Oakland high
outfit for three touchdowns, winning
18-0.
Wel-oiled clockwork couldn't have run
any more smoothly than the frosh back
field in the afternoon preliminary. Solo
mon, big Ernie Nevers, "Buck" Faust,
and Cook who jumped into the game in
place of Nevers and ran sixty yards for
a touchdown, seemed able to gain almost
at will; not to mention A1 Clayes, the
brown-helmeted half who went through
the prep line like a streak, ran back
punts, took passes, and generally made
himself useful.
Everything seemed to go pretty much
in the Yearlings' favor —something like
the way things went for the Olympics
in the last half.
Play after play was completed, for
gains of five to fifteen yards. The line,
which wasn't especially heavy, seemed
to know just what it was about. It elim
inated the proper men at the proper time,
made necessary holes, and suceedcd in
messing up several Long Beach forma
tions.
The line averaged 173 pounds, but
the balance of the percentage was with
Bob Hunt, 197-pound center.
This man Solomon is a going fool. He
can kick—almost a sure shot on places—
can forward pass within a foot of the
receiver, is fast enough to gain on end
runs, and on occasion can buck through
the line for anywhere from four to
seven yards.
"Buck" Faust, halfback who comes
to Stanford from Pittsburg, Pa., is an
other who will bear watching. He put
over two of the six touchdowns, both on
line plunges.
The slaughter started in the first five
minutes. Sholes, right guard, intercepted
a pass in Long Beach's territory and ran
twenty yards along the sideline. Nevers
went through for seven. Solomon for five,
and then Solomon took it over. He made
the try for goal.
The second score catnc after an ex
change of punts had worked the ball well
down the field. A few line bucks, then
Ernie Nevers went across.
Shortly afterward, Nevers had to go
out because of injury to a weak ankle.
Cook ran in and Solomon was shifted to
full.
On the next play Cook took the ball,
ran right through the prep line and
streaked down the field sixty yards, only
stopping when he was behind the goal
posts.
The frosh had time for another score
just before the half was out. A fum
ble, some long gains on off tackle plays,
and Faust made it 27-0.
In the second half Long Beach at
tempted to fight back. Powerful kicks
by Babcock, their fullback, helped some,
but the frosh backfield got into action
again and forced them down the field.
Faust again bucked the ball over.
The final score was made in the third
quarter by a pass, Solomon to Clayes,
and by Clayes' twisting run of twenty
yards. An exchange of punts had worked
the ball into striking distance. Another
chance to tally in the last minutes was
thrown away by offsides, after some
beautiful jmsses from Solomon to the
sub ends, Boone and Stevenson.
Only one substitute, Matson for Evans
at quarter, was used by Ed Keinholz,
the Southern coach.He announced be
fore the game that he was using some
substitutes so as to hold his best men
for a heavy league game next Friday.
The morning game was not much to
watch. Both Oakland and the second
frosh had light teams, and were evenly
matched in the first half, but seemed to
move slowly.
In the third quarter Oakland tired.
After a fumble on her own twenty-five
yard line the freshmen gave way until
the ball went over. Another intercepted
pass in about the same spot paved the
way for the second score, in the fourth
quarter. Frazer carried the ball.
The third touchdown was made on a
pass over the goal, just as the time
keeper was reaching for his gun.
Napoleon Simpson, the negro halfback,
proved to be an easy mark for the Babes,
and was taken out at the beginning of
the third quarter.
"Fat" Nolan, full, and Doug Acker
man, end, stood out for the freshmen.

day, the yearlings methodically wiped up
the stadium with Long Beach high school,
to the lively tunc of 41-0. In the morn
ing the second team —or maybe it was
the third—ran through the Oakland high
outfit for three touchdowns, winning
18-0.
Wel-oiled clockwork couldn't have run
any more smoothly than the frosh back
field in the afternoon preliminary. Solo
mon, big Ernie Nevers, "Buck" Faust,
and Cook who jumped into the game in
place of Nevers and ran sixty yards for
a touchdown, seemed able to gain almost
at will; not to mention A1 Clayes, the
brown-helmeted half who went through
the prep line like a streak, ran back
punts, took passes, and generally made
himself useful.
Everything seemed to go pretty much
in the Yearlings' favor —something like
the way things went for the Olympics
in the last half.
Play after play was completed, for
gains of five to fifteen yards. The line,
which wasn't especially heavy, seemed
to know just what it was about. It elim
inated the proper men at the proper time,
made necessary holes, and suceedcd in
messing up several Long Beach forma
tions.
The line averaged 173 pounds, but
the balance of the percentage was with
Bob Hunt, 197-pound center.
This man Solomon is a going fool. He
can kick—almost a sure shot on places—
can forward pass within a foot of the
receiver, is fast enough to gain on end
runs, and on occasion can buck through
the line for anywhere from four to
seven yards.
"Buck" Faust, halfback who comes
to Stanford from Pittsburg, Pa., is an
other who will bear watching. He put
over two of the six touchdowns, both on
line plunges.
The slaughter started in the first five
minutes. Sholes, right guard, intercepted
a pass in Long Beach's territory and ran
twenty yards along the sideline. Nevers
went through for seven. Solomon for five,
and then Solomon took it over. He made
the try for goal.
The second score catnc after an ex
change of punts had worked the ball well
down the field. A few line bucks, then
Ernie Nevers went across.
Shortly afterward, Nevers had to go
out because of injury to a weak ankle.
Cook ran in and Solomon was shifted to
full.
On the next play Cook took the ball,
ran right through the prep line and
streaked down the field sixty yards, only
stopping when he was behind the goal
posts.
The frosh had time for another score
just before the half was out. A fum
ble, some long gains on off tackle plays,
and Faust made it 27-0.
In the second half Long Beach at
tempted to fight back. Powerful kicks
by Babcock, their fullback, helped some,
but the frosh backfield got into action
again and forced them down the field.
Faust again bucked the ball over.
The final score was made in the third
quarter by a pass, Solomon to Clayes,
and by Clayes' twisting run of twenty
yards. An exchange of punts had worked
the ball into striking distance. Another
chance to tally in the last minutes was
thrown away by offsides, after some
beautiful jmsses from Solomon to the
sub ends, Boone and Stevenson.
Only one substitute, Matson for Evans
at quarter, was used by Ed Keinholz,
the Southern coach.He announced be
fore the game that he was using some
substitutes so as to hold his best men
for a heavy league game next Friday.
The morning game was not much to
watch. Both Oakland and the second
frosh had light teams, and were evenly
matched in the first half, but seemed to
move slowly.
In the third quarter Oakland tired.
After a fumble on her own twenty-five
yard line the freshmen gave way until
the ball went over. Another intercepted
pass in about the same spot paved the
way for the second score, in the fourth
quarter. Frazer carried the ball.
The third touchdown was made on a
pass over the goal, just as the time
keeper was reaching for his gun.
Napoleon Simpson, the negro halfback,
proved to be an easy mark for the Babes,
and was taken out at the beginning of
the third quarter.
"Fat" Nolan, full, and Doug Acker
man, end, stood out for the freshmen.

outfit for three touchdowns, winning
18-0.
Wel-oiled clockwork couldn't have run
any more smoothly than the frosh back
field in the afternoon preliminary. Solo
mon, big Ernie Nevers, "Buck" Faust,
and Cook who jumped into the game in
place of Nevers and ran sixty yards for
a touchdown, seemed able to gain almost
at will; not to mention A1 Clayes, the
brown-helmeted half who went through
the prep line like a streak, ran back
punts, took passes, and generally made
himself useful.
Everything seemed to go pretty much
in the Yearlings' favor —something like
the way things went for the Olympics
in the last half.
Play after play was completed, for
gains of five to fifteen yards. The line,
which wasn't especially heavy, seemed
to know just what it was about. It elim
inated the proper men at the proper time,
made necessary holes, and suceedcd in
messing up several Long Beach forma
tions.
The line averaged 173 pounds, but
the balance of the percentage was with
Bob Hunt, 197-pound center.
This man Solomon is a going fool. He
can kick—almost a sure shot on places—
can forward pass within a foot of the
receiver, is fast enough to gain on end
runs, and on occasion can buck through
the line for anywhere from four to
seven yards.
"Buck" Faust, halfback who comes
to Stanford from Pittsburg, Pa., is an
other who will bear watching. He put
over two of the six touchdowns, both on
line plunges.
The slaughter started in the first five
minutes. Sholes, right guard, intercepted
a pass in Long Beach's territory and ran
twenty yards along the sideline. Nevers
went through for seven. Solomon for five,
and then Solomon took it over. He made
the try for goal.
The second score catnc after an ex
change of punts had worked the ball well
down the field. A few line bucks, then
Ernie Nevers went across.
Shortly afterward, Nevers had to go
out because of injury to a weak ankle.
Cook ran in and Solomon was shifted to
full.
On the next play Cook took the ball,
ran right through the prep line and
streaked down the field sixty yards, only
stopping when he was behind the goal
posts.
The frosh had time for another score
just before the half was out. A fum
ble, some long gains on off tackle plays,
and Faust made it 27-0.
In the second half Long Beach at
tempted to fight back. Powerful kicks
by Babcock, their fullback, helped some,
but the frosh backfield got into action
again and forced them down the field.
Faust again bucked the ball over.
The final score was made in the third
quarter by a pass, Solomon to Clayes,
and by Clayes' twisting run of twenty
yards. An exchange of punts had worked
the ball into striking distance. Another
chance to tally in the last minutes was
thrown away by offsides, after some
beautiful jmsses from Solomon to the
sub ends, Boone and Stevenson.
Only one substitute, Matson for Evans
at quarter, was used by Ed Keinholz,
the Southern coach.He announced be
fore the game that he was using some
substitutes so as to hold his best men
for a heavy league game next Friday.
The morning game was not much to
watch. Both Oakland and the second
frosh had light teams, and were evenly
matched in the first half, but seemed to
move slowly.
In the third quarter Oakland tired.
After a fumble on her own twenty-five
yard line the freshmen gave way until
the ball went over. Another intercepted
pass in about the same spot paved the
way for the second score, in the fourth
quarter. Frazer carried the ball.
The third touchdown was made on a
pass over the goal, just as the time
keeper was reaching for his gun.
Napoleon Simpson, the negro halfback,
proved to be an easy mark for the Babes,
and was taken out at the beginning of
the third quarter.
"Fat" Nolan, full, and Doug Acker
man, end, stood out for the freshmen.
