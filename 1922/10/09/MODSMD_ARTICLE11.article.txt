# WHAT IS MOST FOOLISH NUMBER, CHAPPIE ASKS
## 
### 
What is the most foolish number?
Seven, say some. Zero, say others.
One man when asked, referred to a num
ber called "snake-eyes," which is prob
ably in some foreign language, as the re
porter didn't understand.
But Warren F. Lewis, editor of
Chaparral, says that the next number of
Chappie is going to be the most foolish
number of all. He asks that all con
tributors remember that they are writing
for the Foolish Number when seated in
front of typewriter and drawing board,
and that all contributions be entirely sans
sense. Drawings of the "Monk" Antrim
type were cited by ye editor as examples.
Owing to the Big Game number which
will appear in November coming out
early, the time for publication of this
number will also be advanced, and Octo
ber 16 is the last day on which contribu
tions will be received. Contributions
from new writers arc especially wanted.
