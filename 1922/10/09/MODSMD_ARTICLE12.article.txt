# STRONG OLYMPIC TEAM DEFEATS CARD VARSITY
## Patrick Scores Two Touchdowns In Third Quarter; Kerr's Men Show Lack Of Experience 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
Three weeks from now Andy Kerr's
first Cardinal eleven may be able to win
from the Olympic Club, but last Satur
day it lacked at least two touchdowns
of being a match for Evans' high-pow
ered aggregation.
A hard, driving attack coupled with an
air-tight defense, swept the club gridmen
to a 27 to 9 victory that left no doubt
as to the merits of the two teams —at
this particular date. A crowd estimated
at 10,000 saw the opening game of the
1922 season in the Stadium.
As the winning eleven, the Olympic
Club looked good; as the loser, Stanford
appeared to less advantage. Save for oc
casional flashes in the first and fourth
quarters, Kerr's team acted like what it
really was—an eleven of comparatively
inexperienced men playing their first
game together.
Over-eager linesmen and failure to
tackle correctly at critical moments were
partially responsible for the Cardinal
downfall.
Patrick Scores Twice
Jack Patrick, captain of the Stanford
varsity last year, seemed to cast a magic
spell over K?rr's men. They could stop
the end runs of "Rabbit" Bradshaw, and
the plunges of Needles and Williams,
but whenever Patrick carried the ball no
one seemed to lay hands on him until
he had made a substantial gain. Twice
in the third period the big fullback found
a hole big enough to drive several char
iots through, and eluded the whole back
field for a touchdown.
Evans' line knew what to do and when
to do it, for the backs seldom lacked
an opening. Bradshaw, and later on, D.
King, who replaced him, worked the
right side of the line so often that it
became monotonous. Shipkey was a little
nervous and King, the former Navy star,
put him out of the majority of plays
directed through there.
New Material Shows Promise
When it became aparent. in the sec
ond half, that Stanford had little chance
to win. Kerr sent in substitute after
substitute so that as man of his recruits
as possible would get the "feel" of var
sity competition. Neill, the lightest lines
man on the squad, and a guard on the
1925 team, was perhaps the biggest "dis
covery." He took Shipkey's place, and
stopped up the hole at left tackle.
Cleaveland. with second varsity ex
perience. relieved Doughty, who had
drawn the halfback assignment in place
of Murray. On his first play he ran
back the kick-off for a touchdown only
tn be ealVd back because he stepped
outside. Taylor took Cuddebaek's place
at fullback, and played consistently,
bucking over the Cardinal score in the
final quarter.
Stanford Scores First
Kerr crossed up the "prophets" by
starting Wheat instead of Campbell at
quarter, with Wilcox calling signals. On
the first play after Cuddeback had
kicked oif, Bradshaw fumbled. Stanford
recovering. Line bucks failed to gain
and on the fourth down Cuddeback put
over a place kick from the 17-vard line.
A few minutes before the end of the
half the Olympics started an offensive
from mid-field. Two forward passes and
line bucks brought the ball to the Stan
ford 5-yard line. One yard was needed
for first down, and Needles took it
over. A minute later Wlliiams scored on
a delayed buck through guard.
Wilcox opened the second half by
running back the kick-off 45 yards. Sev
eral passes were intercepted by each
team. Then D. King tore through left
end for 30 yards. On the next play Pat
rick raced 25 yards to a touchdown. A
few minutes later Patrick ran 40 yards
from a scrimmage formation to another
score.
Then Stanford, for the first time since
the start, took the offensive in the fourth
quarter. The Cardinal line stiffened and
the substitute backs were able to make
more headway. Johnson blocked a kick
in mid-field, and Woodward at quarter
started the advance. A 22-yard pass.
Cleaveland to Woodward at quarter,
placed the ballon the Olympic 15-yard
line, and another pass to Campbell
brought it within two yards of the goal.
The Cardinal was penalized five yards
but Taylor bucked the ball over.
Bradshaw soon after intercepted a
pr.ss and then ran through right tackle
for 40 yards and a touchdown.
Sanford completed four out of thir
teen passes attempted while the club
men made four out of six.

Three weeks from now Andy Kerr's
first Cardinal eleven may be able to win
from the Olympic Club, but last Satur
day it lacked at least two touchdowns
of being a match for Evans' high-pow
ered aggregation.
A hard, driving attack coupled with an
air-tight defense, swept the club gridmen
to a 27 to 9 victory that left no doubt
as to the merits of the two teams —at
this particular date. A crowd estimated
at 10,000 saw the opening game of the
1922 season in the Stadium.
As the winning eleven, the Olympic
Club looked good; as the loser, Stanford
appeared to less advantage. Save for oc
casional flashes in the first and fourth
quarters, Kerr's team acted like what it
really was—an eleven of comparatively
inexperienced men playing their first
game together.
Over-eager linesmen and failure to
tackle correctly at critical moments were
partially responsible for the Cardinal
downfall.
Patrick Scores Twice
Jack Patrick, captain of the Stanford
varsity last year, seemed to cast a magic
spell over K?rr's men. They could stop
the end runs of "Rabbit" Bradshaw, and
the plunges of Needles and Williams,
but whenever Patrick carried the ball no
one seemed to lay hands on him until
he had made a substantial gain. Twice
in the third period the big fullback found
a hole big enough to drive several char
iots through, and eluded the whole back
field for a touchdown.
Evans' line knew what to do and when
to do it, for the backs seldom lacked
an opening. Bradshaw, and later on, D.
King, who replaced him, worked the
right side of the line so often that it
became monotonous. Shipkey was a little
nervous and King, the former Navy star,
put him out of the majority of plays
directed through there.
New Material Shows Promise
When it became aparent. in the sec
ond half, that Stanford had little chance
to win. Kerr sent in substitute after
substitute so that as man of his recruits
as possible would get the "feel" of var
sity competition. Neill, the lightest lines
man on the squad, and a guard on the
1925 team, was perhaps the biggest "dis
covery." He took Shipkey's place, and
stopped up the hole at left tackle.
Cleaveland. with second varsity ex
perience. relieved Doughty, who had
drawn the halfback assignment in place
of Murray. On his first play he ran
back the kick-off for a touchdown only
tn be ealVd back because he stepped
outside. Taylor took Cuddebaek's place
at fullback, and played consistently,
bucking over the Cardinal score in the
final quarter.
Stanford Scores First
Kerr crossed up the "prophets" by
starting Wheat instead of Campbell at
quarter, with Wilcox calling signals. On
the first play after Cuddeback had
kicked oif, Bradshaw fumbled. Stanford
recovering. Line bucks failed to gain
and on the fourth down Cuddeback put
over a place kick from the 17-vard line.
A few minutes before the end of the
half the Olympics started an offensive
from mid-field. Two forward passes and
line bucks brought the ball to the Stan
ford 5-yard line. One yard was needed
for first down, and Needles took it
over. A minute later Wlliiams scored on
a delayed buck through guard.
Wilcox opened the second half by
running back the kick-off 45 yards. Sev
eral passes were intercepted by each
team. Then D. King tore through left
end for 30 yards. On the next play Pat
rick raced 25 yards to a touchdown. A
few minutes later Patrick ran 40 yards
from a scrimmage formation to another
score.
Then Stanford, for the first time since
the start, took the offensive in the fourth
quarter. The Cardinal line stiffened and
the substitute backs were able to make
more headway. Johnson blocked a kick
in mid-field, and Woodward at quarter
started the advance. A 22-yard pass.
Cleaveland to Woodward at quarter,
placed the ballon the Olympic 15-yard
line, and another pass to Campbell
brought it within two yards of the goal.
The Cardinal was penalized five yards
but Taylor bucked the ball over.
Bradshaw soon after intercepted a
pr.ss and then ran through right tackle
for 40 yards and a touchdown.
Sanford completed four out of thir
teen passes attempted while the club
men made four out of six.

from the Olympic Club, but last Satur
day it lacked at least two touchdowns
of being a match for Evans' high-pow
ered aggregation.
A hard, driving attack coupled with an
air-tight defense, swept the club gridmen
to a 27 to 9 victory that left no doubt
as to the merits of the two teams —at
this particular date. A crowd estimated
at 10,000 saw the opening game of the
1922 season in the Stadium.
As the winning eleven, the Olympic
Club looked good; as the loser, Stanford
appeared to less advantage. Save for oc
casional flashes in the first and fourth
quarters, Kerr's team acted like what it
really was—an eleven of comparatively
inexperienced men playing their first
game together.
Over-eager linesmen and failure to
tackle correctly at critical moments were
partially responsible for the Cardinal
downfall.
Patrick Scores Twice
Jack Patrick, captain of the Stanford
varsity last year, seemed to cast a magic
spell over K?rr's men. They could stop
the end runs of "Rabbit" Bradshaw, and
the plunges of Needles and Williams,
but whenever Patrick carried the ball no
one seemed to lay hands on him until
he had made a substantial gain. Twice
in the third period the big fullback found
a hole big enough to drive several char
iots through, and eluded the whole back
field for a touchdown.
Evans' line knew what to do and when
to do it, for the backs seldom lacked
an opening. Bradshaw, and later on, D.
King, who replaced him, worked the
right side of the line so often that it
became monotonous. Shipkey was a little
nervous and King, the former Navy star,
put him out of the majority of plays
directed through there.
New Material Shows Promise
When it became aparent. in the sec
ond half, that Stanford had little chance
to win. Kerr sent in substitute after
substitute so that as man of his recruits
as possible would get the "feel" of var
sity competition. Neill, the lightest lines
man on the squad, and a guard on the
1925 team, was perhaps the biggest "dis
covery." He took Shipkey's place, and
stopped up the hole at left tackle.
Cleaveland. with second varsity ex
perience. relieved Doughty, who had
drawn the halfback assignment in place
of Murray. On his first play he ran
back the kick-off for a touchdown only
tn be ealVd back because he stepped
outside. Taylor took Cuddebaek's place
at fullback, and played consistently,
bucking over the Cardinal score in the
final quarter.
Stanford Scores First
Kerr crossed up the "prophets" by
starting Wheat instead of Campbell at
quarter, with Wilcox calling signals. On
the first play after Cuddeback had
kicked oif, Bradshaw fumbled. Stanford
recovering. Line bucks failed to gain
and on the fourth down Cuddeback put
over a place kick from the 17-vard line.
A few minutes before the end of the
half the Olympics started an offensive
from mid-field. Two forward passes and
line bucks brought the ball to the Stan
ford 5-yard line. One yard was needed
for first down, and Needles took it
over. A minute later Wlliiams scored on
a delayed buck through guard.
Wilcox opened the second half by
running back the kick-off 45 yards. Sev
eral passes were intercepted by each
team. Then D. King tore through left
end for 30 yards. On the next play Pat
rick raced 25 yards to a touchdown. A
few minutes later Patrick ran 40 yards
from a scrimmage formation to another
score.
Then Stanford, for the first time since
the start, took the offensive in the fourth
quarter. The Cardinal line stiffened and
the substitute backs were able to make
more headway. Johnson blocked a kick
in mid-field, and Woodward at quarter
started the advance. A 22-yard pass.
Cleaveland to Woodward at quarter,
placed the ballon the Olympic 15-yard
line, and another pass to Campbell
brought it within two yards of the goal.
The Cardinal was penalized five yards
but Taylor bucked the ball over.
Bradshaw soon after intercepted a
pr.ss and then ran through right tackle
for 40 yards and a touchdown.
Sanford completed four out of thir
teen passes attempted while the club
men made four out of six.

of being a match for Evans' high-pow
ered aggregation.
A hard, driving attack coupled with an
air-tight defense, swept the club gridmen
to a 27 to 9 victory that left no doubt
as to the merits of the two teams —at
this particular date. A crowd estimated
at 10,000 saw the opening game of the
1922 season in the Stadium.
As the winning eleven, the Olympic
Club looked good; as the loser, Stanford
appeared to less advantage. Save for oc
casional flashes in the first and fourth
quarters, Kerr's team acted like what it
really was—an eleven of comparatively
inexperienced men playing their first
game together.
Over-eager linesmen and failure to
tackle correctly at critical moments were
partially responsible for the Cardinal
downfall.
Patrick Scores Twice
Jack Patrick, captain of the Stanford
varsity last year, seemed to cast a magic
spell over K?rr's men. They could stop
the end runs of "Rabbit" Bradshaw, and
the plunges of Needles and Williams,
but whenever Patrick carried the ball no
one seemed to lay hands on him until
he had made a substantial gain. Twice
in the third period the big fullback found
a hole big enough to drive several char
iots through, and eluded the whole back
field for a touchdown.
Evans' line knew what to do and when
to do it, for the backs seldom lacked
an opening. Bradshaw, and later on, D.
King, who replaced him, worked the
right side of the line so often that it
became monotonous. Shipkey was a little
nervous and King, the former Navy star,
put him out of the majority of plays
directed through there.
New Material Shows Promise
When it became aparent. in the sec
ond half, that Stanford had little chance
to win. Kerr sent in substitute after
substitute so that as man of his recruits
as possible would get the "feel" of var
sity competition. Neill, the lightest lines
man on the squad, and a guard on the
1925 team, was perhaps the biggest "dis
covery." He took Shipkey's place, and
stopped up the hole at left tackle.
Cleaveland. with second varsity ex
perience. relieved Doughty, who had
drawn the halfback assignment in place
of Murray. On his first play he ran
back the kick-off for a touchdown only
tn be ealVd back because he stepped
outside. Taylor took Cuddebaek's place
at fullback, and played consistently,
bucking over the Cardinal score in the
final quarter.
Stanford Scores First
Kerr crossed up the "prophets" by
starting Wheat instead of Campbell at
quarter, with Wilcox calling signals. On
the first play after Cuddeback had
kicked oif, Bradshaw fumbled. Stanford
recovering. Line bucks failed to gain
and on the fourth down Cuddeback put
over a place kick from the 17-vard line.
A few minutes before the end of the
half the Olympics started an offensive
from mid-field. Two forward passes and
line bucks brought the ball to the Stan
ford 5-yard line. One yard was needed
for first down, and Needles took it
over. A minute later Wlliiams scored on
a delayed buck through guard.
Wilcox opened the second half by
running back the kick-off 45 yards. Sev
eral passes were intercepted by each
team. Then D. King tore through left
end for 30 yards. On the next play Pat
rick raced 25 yards to a touchdown. A
few minutes later Patrick ran 40 yards
from a scrimmage formation to another
score.
Then Stanford, for the first time since
the start, took the offensive in the fourth
quarter. The Cardinal line stiffened and
the substitute backs were able to make
more headway. Johnson blocked a kick
in mid-field, and Woodward at quarter
started the advance. A 22-yard pass.
Cleaveland to Woodward at quarter,
placed the ballon the Olympic 15-yard
line, and another pass to Campbell
brought it within two yards of the goal.
The Cardinal was penalized five yards
but Taylor bucked the ball over.
Bradshaw soon after intercepted a
pr.ss and then ran through right tackle
for 40 yards and a touchdown.
Sanford completed four out of thir
teen passes attempted while the club
men made four out of six.
