## 
### (By United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 9.—(United
Press) —Shipping men today expressed
the belief that the Union Oil tanker
Lyman Stewart was destined to re
main a total loss, on the rocks near
Land's End, at the entrance of San
Francisco harbor.
Oil from the vessel's tanks has been
drawn and air will be pumped into the
ship in an effort to lighten her. Tugs,
the wrecking steamer Homer and the
coast guard crew yesterday placed
heavy cables aboard the ship and she
was boarded for inspection by the
underwriters.
