# STANFORD'S SHOWING
## 
### 
Andy Kerr told the press when lie first came to
California a little over a month ago that he was
going- to build a foundation for a football team and
was not going to sacrifice the fundamentals of
football by making special preparations to win any
one game. That he is putting his ideas into effect
is shown by the showing his team made against
the Olympic Club last Saturday. There were no
special plays, no special formations, and no sacri
fices of football fundamentals. But on the other
hand, flashes of ability on the part of the Cards
were apparent in every department of play.
Features of the play that stand out in accounts
of the game indicate that Kerr has already laid a
foundation on which he will one day have a football
machine in perfect working order 1 . Wilcox ran
back kick-offs from twenty to forty yards; the
Stanford forwards blocked a punt and Johnston re
covered; Dole, Doughty, and others threw the op
posing backs for losses; Cleaveland, Campbell and
Woodward made a touchdown possible by com
pleting long forward passes; Cuddeback put
over a place kick from the seventeen-yard line; the
Stanford backs intercepted several forward passes;
and the forwards at times held their own against
the strongest Club line west of the Rockies.
These features in themselves would make it look
as if Stanford won. The trouble was that the
Olympics were consistent, while Kerr's men showed
ability only in flashes. But these flashes are the
redeeming features of Saturday's game. They are
the bottom stones of Andy Kerr's foundation.
Stanford rooters need only to watch to see that
foundation grow into a building that will last for
years to come.
