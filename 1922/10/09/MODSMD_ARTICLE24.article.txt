Stanford is considered guilty of a discourtesy both
in declining to send a representative to the Pacific
Coast Conference and because of a letter that was
sent to that body at its meeting in Portland last
Saturday. As to the contents of the letter, nothing
may be said. Whatever Dr. Barrow had to say
in that respect has not been made public. But as
to sending a representative to the meeting, some
thing may be said for Stanford's side of the argu
ment.
W hen the Conference took the telegraphic vote
with reference to official action in Stanford's case,
the university in question was not given a chance
to say a word. Stanford was a suspect. In the
second place, Stanford authorities felt that they had
violated no Conference rule and accordingly saw
no reason to offer a defense at the Portland meet
ing. For these reasons it is rather hard to see how
Stanford has been discourteous. As a matter of
fact it looks as if the shoe was on the other foot.
As to the reprimand, nobody seems to be very
down-hearted. It is a crushing blow, of course,
and was designed to make the Cardinal turn into a
faded pink, but it is the opinion of a good many
that Stanford will eventually recover from this ter
rible stroke of the Conference's ax. And at the same
time it will probably keep Stanford athletic author
ities front such extreme "breaches of faith" as
scheduling their own games in Stanford's own sta
dium.
