# WHEN DO WE EAT?
## 
### 
We stayed late to see the freshman game in the
Stadium Saturday morning- and couldn't get any
thing' to eat at the New Union. It was only 12:45.
The new cafeteria, according to a sign on the
door, is closed on Saturday. Too bad. J list when
we were going to run a nice long complimentary
editorial, too.
