A friend of the press informed the management
yesterday that it was time to run the annual ed
itorial directed against petty thieving. He had lost
a notebook. We declined to break into print on the
subject oti the pretext that it was an old idea and
wouldn't do any good. Then somebody hooked a
fountain pen off the editor's desk. Another case
of the right ox being gored.
