# CABBAGES and THINGS

Never have we been so humiliated! Here for yeais
we have struggled along manfully to hold our place in
the cellar of campus honor —how successfully only
readers of this column can say. And then comes thJ
Soph-m-re (we leave it blank so as not to hurt any one's
feelings) Soph-m re poster and takes that honor right
away from us.

The most appropriate thing about the poster was the
black border. It enclosed so much lifeless humor.
* * *
Thank goodness we didn't bite on that twenty-one
point money on the Yankees.

Now that the World Series is over Cabbages at last
feels free to state that this column was always un
reservedly in favor of the Giants and all that kept us
from saying so was our desire to give the Yanks a
fighting chance and not discourage them.

A domestic tragedy: He left her flat, and went to
his own apartment.
* * *
That wasn't original and we wouldn't have even
thought of running it if we hadn't wanted to make the
guy that told it to us feel cheap by seeing it in print.
A man takes his life in his hands if it once gets out
that Cabbages ever prints anything of his. Immediately
all his cliuckle-witted friends proceed to help him out
with all the jokes that survived the Flood.* And the
worst part, of it is that we generally have to run
'em because we can't think of anything smarter. Except
on Monday, of course. Monday wrote this.

Since the flappers have taken up smoking you can
nearly tell which one a man likes best by the brand of
cigarettes he carries.
# * *
That would have been a doggone good joke if long
skirts hadn't come along (that ain't 110 pun, neither)
and driven flapper jokes out of style.

"You sound hoarse."
"Hoarse? I'm hoarser than a battalion of cavalry."

Cabbages makes it a positive rule never to run puns.
We hate to make the poor things pant.
Lawyer: You say you are accused of stealing three
hogs and a cow. Are you guilty?
Client: No sir!
Lawyer: My fee, of course, will he in advance. Have
you any property?
Client: Yessir. Three dogs and a cow.

Laugh at that one and it shows you weren't on the
boat when all the snappy ones came out in 1905.

Several freshmen were seen enjoying an inverted tour
of the campus Friday morning. Those we have inter
viewed state that the gravel walks in the vicinity of
the K. A. house are in splendid shape.

The tie-up was a complete failure. Not even a broken
leg, and we were so hopeful.
