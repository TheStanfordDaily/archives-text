# WOMENâ€™S SCHOLARSHIP STANDING THREATENED
## 
### 
Figures compiled by the Committee on
Scholarship show that woman's vaunted
superiority over man, at Stanford, at
least .is on the decline. During the past
year undergraduate women fell from a
grade point average of 1.74 to 1.70, while
the men gained from 1.39 of the year
before to 1.41.
The University as a whole, however,
maintained the same general level of
former years, according to Professor C.
1!. Whittier, chairman of the committee.
Non-fraternity men and non-sorority
women were far ahead of those living
in Greek-letter houses. Fraternity and
non-fraternity men attained about the
same average respectively as in the past.
Members nf fraternities who'lived else
where were this year classified in the
non-fraternity group, since the table is
based on residence. This accounts for
the apparent decrease in the number of
fraternity men. Th.c lower average of
fraternity men consequently is calculated
as applying to a smaller group; this tends
to raise the general average of men.
Gamma Phi Beta, with eight members
living in the house, and an average of
1.89. led the sororities by a wide margin,
and passe?, the mark of 1.74 made by
Alpha Phi last year.
Among the fraternities Theta Xi dis
placed Alpha Kappa Lambda as leader,
its seventeen members making an aver
age of 1.52. Delta Upsilon was second,
and Alpha Kappa Lambda third.
Sequoia Hall, however, topped all of
the twenty-three fraternities, and led En
cina by .12. Fifty-three students living
in the New Union, which opened last
spring, made an average of 1.38.
Roble Hall, unlike Sequoia, which
gained from 1.42 to 1.52 in the year,
dropped .10, and tied for second in the
women's residence groups with Delta
Delta Delta.
Sorority scholarship gained at the top,
and declined at the bottom. There was
only one house below the 1.50 mark last
year, while now there are four. The
fraternities showed somewhat the same
tendency, but the decline at the bottom
was less marked.
Phi Beta Kappa, which leads the cam
pus organizations, gained from 2.40 to
2.64. Phi Lambda Kappa, men's chemi
cal fraternity, was second, and Wrang
lers, women's debating society, third. All
of the debating societies, incidentally,
have high averages, and are well to the
front in the general ranking.
The 1925 basketball team is consider
ably ahead of the other athletic teams
when it comes to scholarship. Varsity
basketball rated second, with varsity
track third.

spring, made an average of 1.38.
Roble Hall, unlike Sequoia, which
gained from 1.42 to 1.52 in the year,
dropped .10, and tied for second in the
women's residence groups with Delta
Delta Delta.
Sorority scholarship gained at the top,
and declined at the bottom. There was
only one house below the 1.50 mark last
year, while now there are four. The
fraternities showed somewhat the same
tendency, but the decline at the bottom
was less marked.
Phi Beta Kappa, which leads the cam
pus organizations, gained from 2.40 to
2.64. Phi Lambda Kappa, men's chemi
cal fraternity, was second, and Wrang
lers, women's debating society, third. All
of the debating societies, incidentally,
have high averages, and are well to the
front in the general ranking.
The 1925 basketball team is consider
ably ahead of the other athletic teams
when it comes to scholarship. Varsity
basketball rated second, with varsity
track third.
Figures compiled by the Committee on
Scholarship show that woman's vaunted
superiority over man, at Stanford, at
least .is on the decline. During the past
year undergraduate women fell from a
grade point average of 1.74 to 1.70, while
the men gained from 1.39 of the year
before to 1.41.
The University as a whole, however,
maintained the same general level of
former years, according to Professor C.
1!. Whittier, chairman of the committee.
Non-fraternity men and non-sorority
women were far ahead of those living
in Greek-letter houses. Fraternity and
non-fraternity men attained about the
same average respectively as in the past.
Members nf fraternities who'lived else
where were this year classified in the
non-fraternity group, since the table is
based on residence. This accounts for
the apparent decrease in the number of
fraternity men. Th.c lower average of
fraternity men consequently is calculated
as applying to a smaller group; this tends
to raise the general average of men.
Gamma Phi Beta, with eight members
living in the house, and an average of
1.89. led the sororities by a wide margin,
and passe?, the mark of 1.74 made by
Alpha Phi last year.
Among the fraternities Theta Xi dis
placed Alpha Kappa Lambda as leader,
its seventeen members making an aver
age of 1.52. Delta Upsilon was second,
and Alpha Kappa Lambda third.
Sequoia Hall, however, topped all of
the twenty-three fraternities, and led En
cina by .12. Fifty-three students living
in the New Union, which opened last
spring, made an average of 1.38.
