# FRESHMEN GIVEN CRUSHING DEFEAT IN ANNUAL TIE-UP
## Representatives of Newest Class Are Outnumbered by Grease Smeared Sophs 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Outnumbered by almost two to one,
as well as outweighed and outgener
aled, the freshmen fell easy prey be
fore the furious onslaught of the
Crisco-dipped, bare-backed sophomores
in the annual tie-up on the Stanford
diamond Friday.
Only the strong-willed and the reso
lute of heart made up the Babes' sadly
depleted ranks. When the sophomores
growled furiously before the conflict
began, the frenzied freshmen tried to
retaliate in like tone. But tremors
distinguished their growls.
The fight lasted only twenty min
utes, but after half of that time had
been chalked up, great roaming droves
of incensed '25 men, bellowing insist
ently for "more frosh" and envelop
ing them when found, octopus-like,
were all that was left of what had
once been a happy hunting ground.
When the gun which was to com
mence the hostilities was fired, both
forces moved slowly and deliberately
at one another.
The freshmen at least had the con
solation of capturing the second-year
class president and twenty-two other
kinsmen, but outside of that the fresh
men bull-pen was as nothing. The
sophomore morgue on the other hand
had capacity attendance at all times.
The greatest difficulty seemed to be
in finding room in which to brand
the conquered yearlings with a beau
tiful cardinal color.
So enthusiastic did some of the
twenty-three captured sophomores be
come when they saw the apparently
easy victory their brothers were hav
ing, that several of their number at
tempted escape. Here it was that
eager upperclassmen shock troops
were called in to ward off any addi
tional recruits to the '25 ranks. The
"escaped" ones were quickly intro
duced to the water faucets.
"Tiny" Thornhill, Stanford football
coach, was the temporary victim of a
surprise assault when a squad of his
grid proteges jumped him.
