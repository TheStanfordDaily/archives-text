# MUSICAL ASSOCIATION PLANS FOUR CONCERTS
## 
### 
The Peninsula Musical Association
has announced, through circulars
mailed to its members, a series of four
concerts to be given throughout the
year in the Assembly Hall. Advance
sale of memberships, according to Miss
Alice Kimball, secretary, is consider
ably larger than at this time last
year, many new names having been
added. Miss Kimball advises old sub
scribers to send in membership cards
as soon as possible in order to make
sure of their places on the list.
The season will open on Thursday
evening, November 9th, with a con
cert by Marguerite D'Alvarez, the
famous Peruvian contralto of the Chi
cago Opera Company. Madame D'Al
varez is at present touring Australia.
Paul Althouse, tenor of the Metro
politan Opera Company, appears as
the second artist in the Peninsula
course, on Thursday evening, Decem
ber 7th. Mr. Althouse has visited the
Pacific Coast during the last three
seasons, with a greater following on
each successive tour.
Of the third concert, 011 the 22ik1
of March, it may be said that a joint
program by the two foremost artists
of France is an event of the first
magnitude, even for a large city. Thi
baud is called the "poet of the violin,"
and Courtot is a pianist of the same
type.
The London String Quartet, who
played here last December, will fur
nish the last concert of the series on
Thursday, April 12th. Although it has
never before been the policy of the
musical association to bring the same
attraction lvere in two successive sea
sons, the impression made by this
perfect ensemble organization was felt
to be sufficient reason for securing it
a second time. The fact that Honolulu
is paying this quartet a tremendous
figui'e to come from England for a
series of six concerts makes it pos
sible for them to accept a few en
gagements in the vicinity of San Fran
cisco, before litey sail for the islands.
The community may well feel that
no previous season has offered a
stronger list of attractions than this
one. Any interested persons who have
not received announcements and wish
further information are asked to noti
fy the secretary, Miss Alice Kimball,
536 Lincoln Avenue. The date for clos
ing the membership list is October
20th.
