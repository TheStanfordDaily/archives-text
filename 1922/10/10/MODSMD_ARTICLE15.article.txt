# All Tryoutees For 1925 Quad Called To Report Tonight
## 
### 
All sophomore men or women who
wish to try out either for editor or
manager of the 1925 Quad are asked
to report tonight at 7 o'clock to the
Quad office on the second floor of the
Administration Building. Carl Shoup
and Charles White, editor and man
ager of the 1924 Quad, will conduct
the meeting of the two branches of
tryoutees.
Any sophomore man or woman is
eligible to tryout for either editor or
manager. No previous journalistic ex
perience of any kind is necessary as a
qualification, and everyone will be
started with the same chances, re
gardless of previous record. It is im
portant, however, that all who expect
to try out should attend this first
meeting.
