# DAVIS PLANS CHECK ON ATTENDANCE AT GYMNASIUM CLASSES
## 
### 
A new system of reporting for com
pulsory Physical Training is to be in
augurated by C. W. Davis, new di
rector of intramural activities, who
has just arrived on the campus. In
stead of taking the rolls on the vari
ous courts, the proctors will eliminate
chances for error by having the men
assemble on the floor of Encina gym'
nasium at twenty minutes after the ap
pointed hour. This allows plenty of
time for a change into sport clothing.
Men will then be assigned to regular
courts, and proctors will make the
rounds from time to time to see that
all the courts are in use. In this way
the directors Can use the equipment to
full efficiency, and confusion will be
greatly reduced.
The intramural idea, as expressed
by Mr. Davis, is. "It gets hold of fel
lows, especially sophomores, juniors,
and seniors, who are not bound up in
something definite, and fellows who
are not qualified for a Varsity team.
It gives them a chance to try them
selves out. They are led to experiment,
and every once in a while a man sur
prises himself, and turns out to be
Varsity material after all."
