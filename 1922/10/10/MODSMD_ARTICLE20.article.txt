# FIRST ASSEMBLY GIVES MICE TO INCOMING CLASS
## Coach Andy Kerr Makes First Appearance Before Student Audience; Landis Talks 
### 
"If you don't think Stanford is tht*
greatest university in the world you
shouldn't be here," said Varsity Foot
hall Coach Andy Kerr, the concluding:
speaker in the quarter's first freshman
"get on the boat" assembly in tlm
auditorium last night. "If you do, get
behind her one hundred per cent," was
his advice.
Kerr approved of the system at Stan
ford of permitting participation in
sports instead of requiring gymnasium
work. "Pick out the sport in which
you think you will make good," he
said. "When you do come out for a
sport give it your best. Catch the
Stanford spirit if you have to get it
through a tub or a club, and stand
back of everything Stanford stands
for, all of the time.
Victor Smith, '19, representing tho
Y. M. C. A., was chairman. He con
gratulated the class of '26 on its ad
vantages in having such assemblies to
put them on the right road and give
them a good start. He said that 'way
back in '15 when he was a freshman
his sole reception was "a peanm race."
"When someone bet on me to win
and thought I wasn't going fast enough
he administered encouragement from,
the rear." Now, although the poster
fight survives, the new student re
ceives instruction in what to do and
what not to do, and escapes a great
many hard experiences.
Phil Landis, '23, president of the As
sociated Students, was the first speak
er. He outlined what was required of
a Stanford man and woman. "Conduct
yourself as any well-bred person
would, observe the little customs and
traditions, and you will never have to
fear as far as discipline is concerned,"
he said. "Make as many friends as you
can, especially in your own class. H?vr*
a love for Stanford and remember that:
you are a Stanford man or woman and
make that mean something in the
world at large."
The field of debating at Stanford
was covered by Robert Binkley, '20,
for six years prominent in that activ
ity at Stanford, and a participant in
many intercollegiate debates. He
touched 011 the branches of debating
at Stanford —the intersociety debates
between Nestoria and Euphronia, the
interclass debates between the fresh
men and sophomores, the freshman
contest with the University of Cali
fornia, intercollegiate triangular meets
with California and the University of
Southern California, and with the Uni
versity of Oregon and the University
of Washington. Binkley also spoke of
the benefit to be derived from debat
ing. "The value of debating," he said,
"lies not only in the development of a
facility in speaking, but also in the
encouragement of a certain wholesome
skepticism in reading and weighing
printed matter. Stanford debaters have
never been quibblers nor exponents of
a flowery style, but they have always
stood for intellectual honesiy."
A1 Huneke, '24, and an assistant yell
leader, spoke of the work of the Y. M.
C. A. The first communication most
freshmen receive from Stanford comes
from the Y. M. C. A. in the form of a
freshman bible. The two secretaries,
Dr. Morgan and Jim Sparling, are al
ways glad to meet students Slid give
any help or advice they can. Student
work in this organization also in
cludes the leadership of boys' clubs in
communities near Stanford.
Speaking of journalism at Stanford,
the fourth speaker, Bill Leiser, '21,
former editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
said, "It interests more students all
the year around more than any activ
ity. Its members are constantly in
touch with other activities. They are
011 the inside and know how Stanford
works. The so-called campus journal
ist is a bug you will become more 01*
less' familiar with for the reason that
he represents a normal part of Stan
ford life."
Leiser explained a few Stanford tra
ditions and advised freshmen to ob
serve the no-queening rule and to de
vote time to class work. "After you are
successful in your studies, make good
in activities. After you are successful
in your studies and activities then you
can afford to 'specialize'," he said.
This is the first of a series of four
assemblies, to be given on succeeding
Monday nights under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A.and the
Associated Students.

you think you will make good," he
said. "When you do come out for a
sport give it your best. Catch the
Stanford spirit if you have to get it
through a tub or a club, and stand
back of everything Stanford stands
for, all of the time.
Victor Smith, '19, representing tho
Y. M. C. A., was chairman. He con
gratulated the class of '26 on its ad
vantages in having such assemblies to
put them on the right road and give
them a good start. He said that 'way
back in '15 when he was a freshman
his sole reception was "a peanm race."
"When someone bet on me to win
and thought I wasn't going fast enough
he administered encouragement from,
the rear." Now, although the poster
fight survives, the new student re
ceives instruction in what to do and
what not to do, and escapes a great
many hard experiences.
Phil Landis, '23, president of the As
sociated Students, was the first speak
er. He outlined what was required of
a Stanford man and woman. "Conduct
yourself as any well-bred person
would, observe the little customs and
traditions, and you will never have to
fear as far as discipline is concerned,"
he said. "Make as many friends as you
can, especially in your own class. H?vr*
a love for Stanford and remember that:
you are a Stanford man or woman and
make that mean something in the
world at large."
The field of debating at Stanford
was covered by Robert Binkley, '20,
for six years prominent in that activ
ity at Stanford, and a participant in
many intercollegiate debates. He
touched 011 the branches of debating
at Stanford —the intersociety debates
between Nestoria and Euphronia, the
interclass debates between the fresh
men and sophomores, the freshman
contest with the University of Cali
fornia, intercollegiate triangular meets
with California and the University of
Southern California, and with the Uni
versity of Oregon and the University
of Washington. Binkley also spoke of
the benefit to be derived from debat
ing. "The value of debating," he said,
"lies not only in the development of a
facility in speaking, but also in the
encouragement of a certain wholesome
skepticism in reading and weighing
printed matter. Stanford debaters have
never been quibblers nor exponents of
a flowery style, but they have always
stood for intellectual honesiy."
A1 Huneke, '24, and an assistant yell
leader, spoke of the work of the Y. M.
C. A. The first communication most
freshmen receive from Stanford comes
from the Y. M. C. A. in the form of a
freshman bible. The two secretaries,
Dr. Morgan and Jim Sparling, are al
ways glad to meet students Slid give
any help or advice they can. Student
work in this organization also in
cludes the leadership of boys' clubs in
communities near Stanford.
Speaking of journalism at Stanford,
the fourth speaker, Bill Leiser, '21,
former editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
said, "It interests more students all
the year around more than any activ
ity. Its members are constantly in
touch with other activities. They are
011 the inside and know how Stanford
works. The so-called campus journal
ist is a bug you will become more 01*
less' familiar with for the reason that
he represents a normal part of Stan
ford life."
Leiser explained a few Stanford tra
ditions and advised freshmen to ob
serve the no-queening rule and to de
vote time to class work. "After you are
successful in your studies, make good
in activities. After you are successful
in your studies and activities then you
can afford to 'specialize'," he said.
This is the first of a series of four
assemblies, to be given on succeeding
Monday nights under the auspices of
the Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A.and the
Associated Students.
"If you don't think Stanford is tht*
greatest university in the world you
shouldn't be here," said Varsity Foot
hall Coach Andy Kerr, the concluding:
speaker in the quarter's first freshman
"get on the boat" assembly in tlm
auditorium last night. "If you do, get
behind her one hundred per cent," was
his advice.
Kerr approved of the system at Stan
ford of permitting participation in
sports instead of requiring gymnasium
work. "Pick out the sport in which
you think you will make good," he
said. "When you do come out for a
sport give it your best. Catch the
Stanford spirit if you have to get it
through a tub or a club, and stand
