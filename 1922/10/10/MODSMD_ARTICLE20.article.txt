## Coach Andy Kerr Makes First Appearance Before Student Audience; Landis Talks

"If you don't think Stanford is tht*
greatest university in the world you
shouldn't be here," said Varsity Foot
hall Coach Andy Kerr, the concluding:
speaker in the quarter's first freshman
"get on the boat" assembly in tlm
auditorium last night. "If you do, get
behind her one hundred per cent," was
