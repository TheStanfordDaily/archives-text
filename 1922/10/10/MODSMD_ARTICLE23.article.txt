# Fraternity or Not? If So, Which?

(An Editorial intended to clear up living group issues)
Contrary to certain freshmen's suppositions that
they must decide with which fraternities they should
affiliate, this editorial sets out to show that they
must first decide whether or not they intend to go
to a fraternity; if not, the matter is at an end; if so,
then this discussion is intended to give them basis
for further serious thought. It is impossible, how
ever, to touch more than the high points of the
present situation.
Whether or not a freshman goes to a fraternity
is his own business. The editor takes it for granted
that freshmen have their own views on that sub
ject. There is only one thing to be said—don't
scramble madly in for the sake of being "rushed." or
of "making" a fraternity. In the first place, to
"rush" a man into a living group with which he is
expected to be affiliated for four years is the
sheerest absurdity. The use of this term defeats the
very purpose it is expected to fulfill. It sounds
as if the candidate were being hurried into a group
before he had a chance to see who his new asso
ciates were to be. And the length of the present
"rushing" period gives further ground for such a
suspicion. The amount of time given a freshman
to decide proves that it IS a "rush."
"MAKING" IS A MISLEADING TERM
"Making" a fraternity is another false alarm. No
man, no matter what his record has been, can expect
to be recognized to the extent of "making" any
thing within a period of either thirteen days or nine
weeks, although the latter more nearly approaches
the reasonable amount of time. A man may "join"
a fraternity, or even, if it is insisted, be "accepted
into one," but he can never "make" it. Such an
idea puts both the man and the fraternity on a plane
of excellence indicating social, mental or perhaps
even physical superiority. This classification is
not only false, but is unfair to the majority element
in the University—the non-fraternity men.
ONLY ONE KIND OF STANFORD MAN
Both the fraternity and non-fraternity elements
at Stanford are recognized institutions. They are
the result of an attempt by the same kind of people
to form two classes—two distinct types. They seek
to set up and to maintain two different kinds of
standards and people. There is no such distinction
really in existence on the campus today. There is
only ONE type and only ONE set of standards —
STANFORD men with STANFORD STAND
ARDS.
"RUSHING" RULES TODAY
Fraternities are not agreed on the length of the
"rushing" period at the present time. There is no
break, and there should be none, but there is at any
rate a difference of opinion. One group, the Inter
fraternity Conference, greatly in the majority, be
lieves in the thirteen-day "rushing" period, while a
smaller group, the Fraternity Council, comprised of
only three living groups, holds out for the nine
week period. There is something to be said for both
sides, although the Conference refuses to recognize
the existence of the Council as an organization.
The writer, as a non-fraternity man, may or may
not show good judgment by taking sides in this
debate among fraternities. The outstanding facts
of the case, however, should be made clear, regard
less of consequences.
The Interfraternity Conference docs not believe
in upsetting the freshmen by constant "rushing"
for longer than thirteen days. The short period is
devised to save worry, time, and expense. The idea
is a good one.
The Fraternity Council, with a nine-week period,
however, goes deeper into the matter. It does not
stop at the surface with an eye to saving time,
expense, or worry for the following very good rea
son: It is better to be worried, unsettled and dis
satisfied for nine weeks than to cut it to thirteen

days and be miserable for four years! Perhaps
this is stated- too strongly, but 011 the face of the
matter it is the absolute truth. Tt should not be
necessary to try to coat it over with oily words.
difficult for both groups
Objections have been raised by the Interfraternity
Conference to the form letter sent out to all enter
ing- freshmen, outlining the stand of the Fraternity
Council. Insofar as criticisms of the Interfraternity
Conference contained in that letter are concerned,
the smaller group was very much in the wrong. So
far as it was only a measure of protection because
of its longer rushing period, the Council was en
tirely within its own rights. So long as any fra
ternity satisfies the minimum University scholar
ship requirements and conforms to University regu
lations, it is not responsible to ANYBODY for
ANY action it takes.
The Fraternity Council is gaining nothing from
a purely selfish point of view by extending its
rushing period. Its members will probably lose by
it this year. But in the long run, they will benefit
if they are strong enough to weather the present
situation.
Th Interfraternity Conference asks that all fresh
men "bid" pledge themselves to membership in its
group within thirteen days after coming to the Uni
versity. The Fraternity Council asks them to hold
off for nine weeks. If a little holding off is good,
in this case a whole lot of it is better. The Council
has made a move in the right direction but it will
have to move further. And the Interfraternity
Conference, recognizing, as it does, the change that
must come over the living group situation with the
beginning of Encina Hall as a freshman dormitory,
will soon be sympathetic with May pledging. And
so the "rushing" problem, as it stands today, is only
temporary.
IN CONCLUSION
Unless freshmen KNOW what they are doing,
they make a mistake by becoming members of fra
ternities on short notice. Thirteen days to choose
their associates for the next four years!
Alumni fraternities believe in May pledging.
Their chapters will do well to listen to their gradu
ated members.
There is either a lot of dissatisfaction among
members of fraternities now, or else there have been
some of the luckiest choices in the world. The
present situation is certainly not the result of careful
choice and good judgment.
These are the facts. And the editor is enthusi
astic enough about them to say. like Stalton, the
bank cashier of movie fame, that "if he has said
anything to be sorry for, he is damn glad of it."
