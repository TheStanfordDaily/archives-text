day edition. However, the editor reserves that day for
himself.

Monologue—heard at football game—"Oh, goodness.
Mabel, look at those boys—all of them drinking out of
the same bucket! Dear me, Mabel, isn't it awful the
way they treat 'em? I couldn't bear to —What? My nose
shiny? Oh, Mabel, I've forgotten my powder puff. Lend,
me yours, that's a dear!"

"There Ain't No Santy Claus!"
The girl was very sweet and coy,
She looked at him and said:
"The night is rather chilly,
I've nowhere to lay my head!"
He gave her just one startled look,
And then in haste he said,
"I'll take you home, if that's the case,
So you can go to bed!"

From Friday's Daily: "Lost —A wallet, large pocket
size." We are glad that there is one man on the campus
that still has large pockets after paying tuition.

Speaking of football games, the gent from Arizona
in front of us was heard to remark that if he were in
that game he'd walk right up to the guy with the ball
and poke a good big hole right in his stomach. And
after he had done that he would reach in and grab the
opponent's gizzard and pull it out and slap him across
the face with it. We went and sat in another part of
the bleachers where our gizzard felt more permanent.

We crave a little information on that last World's
Series game. We were listening in our little radio set
and we heard as how somebody or other singled to
warmer and fairer fo rtoday and how somebody else
scored on a selection entitled "Do It Again." We've
never played much baseball but that doesn't sound quite
right.
