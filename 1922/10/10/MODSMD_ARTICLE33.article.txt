# Will Exhibit Tapestry
## 
### 
J. Neilsen Laurvik will present the
results of two years' work in an ex
hibition of seventy-nine examples of
tapestry which are now on display at
the Palace of Fine Arts in San Fran
cisco. The display is open daily from
10 to 5, and a special ticket printed for
Stanford University has been issued at
half the price of a single admission
{25 cents). These tickets, for the use
of students and members of the Fac
ulty and their families, may be ob
tained at the Registrar's office or at
the Graphic Art Building.
This is the first time that a com
plete historical survey of the art has
been presented in America. Ten or
more galleries are hung with these
priceless products of the loom, many
of them twelve to twenty or more feet
across, and at times representing the
work of. one individual for a year in
the production of a square yard. The
subjects range from allegorical, class
ical and mythological to landscapes,
portraits, and still life, and, for the
most part, are brilliantly typical and
always characteristic of their particu
lar style.
