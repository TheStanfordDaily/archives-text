"Bud" Woodward seems bound to
make a place for himself on Kerr's
eleven, despite the fact that majority
opinion was that he is too light for the
new system. He engineered the team
to a touchdown in the final period, and
caught a long forward pass. Wood
ward's ability to throw short passes,
coupled with his experience as a pilot,
make it hard for Kerr to keep him oil
the bench.
