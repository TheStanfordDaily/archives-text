# Fire Marshal Ed Lamb Asks Houses to Clean Up
## 
### 
With fire prevention week set for
October 9 to 1(1 on the campus, Comp
troller Roth and Fire Marshal Ed
Lamb have requested that all fra
ternities and other living groups on
the campus clean house and place all
rubbish where it can be hauled away
easily. All such rubbish will be hauled
to the bonfire, which is to be built at
the same place as last year.
Twenty-two of the twenty-four fires
which have occurred on the campus in
the last eight months have been the
results of carelessness, says Lamb.
