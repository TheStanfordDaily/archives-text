### 
The first Tuesday Evening lecture
of the quarter will be delivered tonight
in the Little Theater at 7:30i when
Professor S. L. Joshi of the University
of Bombay will speak on "New Forces
fn Old India."
Professor Joshi is a native of India
and was brought up in an atmosphere
of Moslem culture, but accepted the
Christian faith and later was a student
at Union Theological Seminary in New
York City. He received his B. A. de
gree in History and Economics at the
University of Madras in 1596. In 1902
he came to New York with his family
and took post-graduate work at Colum
bia University, receiving tne degree
of M. A. in 1905.
Soon afterward he returned to India
and accepted the chair of English Lit
erature at Baroda College, University
of Bombay. In 1907 Professor Joshi
was chosen to represent India at the
International Peace Conference in
New York, and the following year was
sent to the Congress of Religious Lib
erals which was held in Boston.
The lecturer is a brother of the
Reverend D. L. Joshi, who has become
noted for his active participation in
the movement toward church reunion
in India. One of his greatest works
toward promoting Christianity in his
native country has been the establish
ment of a Converts' Home in Bombay
which receives, shelters and trains
converts from the higher castes of
Hinduism.
Professor Joshi is at present on a
deputation from the Anglican Bishop
of Bombay, sent with a view to enlist
the interest of the American Episcopal
Church in the Bombay Converts' Home
and, if possible, in the establishment
of a direct missionary contact with
India.
