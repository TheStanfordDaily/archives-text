What good clothes do
for you
They give you good style to begin with; the
fine, all-wool fabrics and expert tailoring keep
the clothes looking right; they save your
money because such clothes wear longer. j
You get those things here; we sell nothing but
good clothes; Hart Schaffner & Marx clothes.
You'll get what you ought to have here.
