# FRESH SCRIMMAGE KERR'S SQUAD TODAY
## 
### 
Freshman and varsity squads lined
up against each other in scrimmage
formation this afternoon.
For the freshmen, the affair was to
be in the nature of a test of staying
power. If the yearling machine should
hold together under the severe gruel
ling, and show something of the work
manlike football displayed Saturday,
Coach Hunt will have little to com
plain about.
If not, the recipe is to be an even
stiffer practice program.
There is not much elation in the
freshman ranks over the last week's
victories. Long Beach, which suffered
the most, was using many substitutes,
holding its huskies for a battle with
a high school rival in the South.
Besides, the Babes have no time for
rejoicing. Hunt, Post, and Jake Ir
win—now looking after the frosh third
and fourth —have been keeping the
squads on the jump. Last night the
four teams ran up and down the field
for the full two hours, practicing sig
nals and formations.

along behind Fullback Ernie Nevers.
or crouching off to one side, puts in
a word every few minutes where it
is needed to polish off the rough
edges. Post, doing the same thing with
j the second team, keeps up a rapid fire
jef comment and instruction.
A two-team system, with an auxil
iary tquad for each, is being developed
by the yearling coaches. On the sec
ond, or substitute string, are Clayes
and Cook, the two halvos who scored
whenever they got into the game Sat
urday, Rispin, quarter, who played the
first half, and Boone, the big end who
I caught some pretty passes in the last
[quarter. Boone, who weighs over 175,
lias been shifted to guard.
Douglas Ackerman, third team end
who starred against Oakland with his
tackles and speed in getting down on
punts, was given a chance on the first
line yesterday. He may be seen in
scrimmage this afternoon.
The injured list still claims three
of the squad. Nevers is playing, but
going easy on his weak ankle; Steven
son, end, is doing the same with a
bruised shoulder and pulled leg mus
cle, and Boles, another first string
end, is out of uniform with a torn leg
ligament.
The freshmen play another double
header Saturday, against San Jose
high school in the morning and Lowell

For the freshmen, the affair was to
be in the nature of a test of staying
power. If the yearling machine should
hold together under the severe gruel
ling, and show something of the work
manlike football displayed Saturday,
Coach Hunt will have little to com
plain about.
If not, the recipe is to be an even
stiffer practice program.
There is not much elation in the
freshman ranks over the last week's
victories. Long Beach, which suffered
the most, was using many substitutes,
holding its huskies for a battle with
a high school rival in the South.
Besides, the Babes have no time for
rejoicing. Hunt, Post, and Jake Ir
win—now looking after the frosh third
and fourth —have been keeping the
squads on the jump. Last night the
four teams ran up and down the field
for the full two hours, practicing sig
nals and formations.
In these work-outs, Hunt, striding
along behind Fullback Ernie Nevers.
or crouching off to one side, puts in
a word every few minutes where it
is needed to polish off the rough
edges. Post, doing the same thing with
j the second team, keeps up a rapid fire
jef comment and instruction.
A two-team system, with an auxil
iary tquad for each, is being developed
by the yearling coaches. On the sec
ond, or substitute string, are Clayes
and Cook, the two halvos who scored
whenever they got into the game Sat
urday, Rispin, quarter, who played the
first half, and Boone, the big end who
I caught some pretty passes in the last
[quarter. Boone, who weighs over 175,
lias been shifted to guard.
Douglas Ackerman, third team end
who starred against Oakland with his
tackles and speed in getting down on
punts, was given a chance on the first
line yesterday. He may be seen in
scrimmage this afternoon.
The injured list still claims three
of the squad. Nevers is playing, but
going easy on his weak ankle; Steven
son, end, is doing the same with a
bruised shoulder and pulled leg mus
cle, and Boles, another first string
end, is out of uniform with a torn leg
ligament.
The freshmen play another double
header Saturday, against San Jose
high school in the morning and Lowell
high in the preliminary to the varsity-
Santa Clara contest.
