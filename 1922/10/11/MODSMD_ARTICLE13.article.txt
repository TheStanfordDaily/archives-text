# INDIA SITUATION IS OUTLINED BY JOSHI IN TUESDAY LECTURE

* Will the instigation of the recent
non-cooperation program in India
serve to "bring the English govern
ment to its senses," or, coupled with
the "back to the spinning-wheel"
movement which is meant to accom
plish the same end, will it precipitate
possible war with the home govern
ment?
Such seems to be the question in
regard to the present political situa
tion in India, according to Professor
S. L. Joshi of the University of Bom
bay who spoke last evening in the
Little Theater on "New Forces in Old
India."
Professor Joshi believes the present
unrest in his home country is due to
political and economic disorders which
might have been averted by wiser
action on the part of the British gov
ernment. The recent trouble in the
Punjab which resulted from the in
stitution of martial law in that district
and the subsequent atrocities which
it caused, gave rise to a feeling of
illiteracy which has persisted in India
for the past thirty years in spite of
the hope that conditions would be im
proved after the establishment of the
British. This is, according to
Professor Joshi. the underlying cause
for the present unsettled conditions in
this portion of the British Empire.
The lecturer laid great stress upon
the economic aspect of the present
situation, and showed how the ever
widening gulf between the Indian wage
standard and the price of commodi
ties has caused a state of universal
poverty which has been increased by
post-war conditions. During the cur
rent difficulties in which the leader
ship of Ghandi has figured so conspic
uously, we have been given an exam
; pie of the influence which one man
| can wield over a nation the size of
India, an influence which. Professor
Joshi believes, would have been for
the benefit of Great Britain had her
I near-sighted policy not led to the
: political blunder of his imprisonment.
! All India is striving toward a re
turn to her Golden Age of intellectual
culture and is looking forward to the
/lay when her native literature may
take again its place among the litera
tures of the world, as it did in the
days before Mohammedan conquest
crushed her intellectual activity.
In spite of the fact that Hindu and
Anglo-Saxon civilizations have di
verged widely in their fields of
achievement, both have made very
valuable contributions to the progress
of humanity, said Professor Joshi, and
it is to be hoped that an emphasis
upon their points of contact, and a
of their fellowship and com
mon interests may lead to the accom
plishment of a marvelous program in
the future.

! All India is striving toward a re
turn to her Golden Age of intellectual
culture and is looking forward to the
/lay when her native literature may
take again its place among the litera
tures of the world, as it did in the
days before Mohammedan conquest
crushed her intellectual activity.
In spite of the fact that Hindu and
Anglo-Saxon civilizations have di
verged widely in their fields of
achievement, both have made very
valuable contributions to the progress
of humanity, said Professor Joshi, and
it is to be hoped that an emphasis
upon their points of contact, and a
of their fellowship and com
mon interests may lead to the accom
plishment of a marvelous program in
the future.
* Will the instigation of the recent
non-cooperation program in India
serve to "bring the English govern
ment to its senses," or, coupled with
the "back to the spinning-wheel"
movement which is meant to accom
plish the same end, will it precipitate
possible war with the home govern
ment?
Such seems to be the question in
regard to the present political situa
tion in India, according to Professor
S. L. Joshi of the University of Bom
bay who spoke last evening in the
Little Theater on "New Forces in Old
India."
Professor Joshi believes the present
unrest in his home country is due to
political and economic disorders which
might have been averted by wiser
action on the part of the British gov
ernment. The recent trouble in the
Punjab which resulted from the in
stitution of martial law in that district
and the subsequent atrocities which
it caused, gave rise to a feeling of
illiteracy which has persisted in India
for the past thirty years in spite of
the hope that conditions would be im
proved after the establishment of the
British. This is, according to
Professor Joshi. the underlying cause
for the present unsettled conditions in
this portion of the British Empire.
The lecturer laid great stress upon
the economic aspect of the present
situation, and showed how the ever
widening gulf between the Indian wage
standard and the price of commodi
ties has caused a state of universal
poverty which has been increased by
post-war conditions. During the cur
rent difficulties in which the leader
ship of Ghandi has figured so conspic
uously, we have been given an exam
; pie of the influence which one man
| can wield over a nation the size of
India, an influence which. Professor
Joshi believes, would have been for
the benefit of Great Britain had her
I near-sighted policy not led to the
: political blunder of his imprisonment.
