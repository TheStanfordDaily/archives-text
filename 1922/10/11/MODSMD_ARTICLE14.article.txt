# FOOTBALL REVIEW IS PLANNED BY RAM'S HEAD
## 
### 
Committees for the football show will
be chosen at a meeting of Ram's Head
Society at 1 p. m. tomorrow.
The show this year, as it was last
year, will be of the revue type, says
Dick Taylor, '23. and despite all pres
ent-day conventions the chorus queens
will not be allowed to wear their
street-sweeping gowns.
Dick Malaby, '23, and Dan Evans,
'20, have been working on the songs
and lyrics.
A secretary-treasurer is to be elected
at the meeting tomorrow.
