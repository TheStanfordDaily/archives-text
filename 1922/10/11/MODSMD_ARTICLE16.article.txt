# YEAR'S ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED BY STUDENT SPEAKERS
## Undergraduate Leaders Emphasize Necessity For Co-operation In Advancing Stanford Ideals 
### 
Stanford is set for a great year and the one essential to success is cooperation
from every student in the University. This was the underlying message of the
asembly held this morning when representative student speakers outlined under
graduate activities and responsibilities fur the coming year.
"We already have a sturdy foundation and now it's up to us to strive for
further achievements," Phil Landis, president of A. S. S. U. said in his opening
talk. "Success depends on cooperation of the individual members of every
campus group. This in turn is based on friendship, not only between students but
between the student body and the faculty and alumni. The fundamental thing
in the welfare of Stanford and not individual achievement."

Landis urged each student to take
his own share of the responsibility for
the caliber of Stanford ideals and then
maintenance.
Margaret White, '23, president of
Associated Women, spoke briefly on
the women's participation in under
graduate activities. "Our aim is the
building up of the right spirit to back
our organization," she said. She be
lieves that this spirit depends on tb
cooperation of the men in living up to
the social standards set by the women's
governing body.
Tom Irwin, '23, pointed out the op
portunities for journalistic efforts. "No
other university the size of Stanford has
a better rounded out field of journalism;
the fact that a student body of this size
supports so many publications is proof
that there is a tremendous interest in
journalism on the campus," Irwin de
clared. He explained briefly the type
of writing desired by the editors of
student publications, the Pictorial, the
Cardinal, the Chaparral, the Illustrated
Review, and The Daily Palo Alto.
Speaking of the student paper, Irwin
said, "It is your paper, not one run
just by the staff. Every one has a right
to use its columns to express his ideas."
Dick Taylor, '23, sketched Stanford's
dramatic outlook and said that the pres
ent optimistic prospects were due to
three things. First, the work of the
students themselves who enthusiastically
supported dramatics from tryouts to
the box office; the second point was
the excellent coaching staff; and of
the past years the third was the or
ganization of the Dramatic Council
which has raised the level of campus
productions to a high plane.
Women's athletics were discussed
briefly by Eunice Biddle. '24, president
of W. A. A. She believes that the
women, like the men, have found that
the athletic field is the place to develop
true sportsmanship. Their sports arc
varied and the year's calendar includes
hockey and swimming meets with Mills
and the University of California.
Dud DeGroot, '23. explained to the
new students the adoption of the honor
system at Stanford a year and a half
