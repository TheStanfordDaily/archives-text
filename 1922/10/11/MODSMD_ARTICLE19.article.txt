# OPENING BLEACHER RALLY OF SEASON SET FOR TOMORROW
## Janssen Forced Out of Game By Sprained Ankle; Kerr's Men Will Oppose Grays 
### 
BLEACHER RALLY

Here are the facts on the first
bleacher rally of the year tomor
row:
The Time and Place —Section
C of the Stadium at 3:30
The Purpose—To send off the
Cardinal eleven for 'he second
game of the season with Santa
Plara Saturday, as well as to or
ganize the rooting section.
The "five-hundred" are invited
and expected to attend. Freshmen
and new students will |j£ present
en masse to learn the Stanford
yells.
The varsity will scrimmage
with the grays in the last real
practice before the game Satur
day.

ell Leader Louis Minsky, '23, and
his two assistants, A1 Huneke, "24 and
Burt Lapp, '24, will be in charge of
the first bleacher rally of the year to
be held at the Stadium at 3 :30 tomorrow
afternoon.
At that time the whole repertoire of
Cardinal songs and yells will be gone
through in preparation for the Santa
hopes for a crowd of 1500, including
a large number of women.
Coach Andv Kerr will have his grid
iron warriors practicing at the Stadium
during the "pep" session, and Cardinal
followers will see what changes have
been made since the battle with the
Olympic Club. There will be a scrim
mage between the first eleven and
"Red Betts' grays.
Bob Janssen, the tall end on the var
sity, won't be able to draw on a cleated
shoe for somf weeks to come. Janssen's
ankle was badly sprained last night
when he was running down under a
punt. That brings Glenn Hartranft.
the all-round Jrack man, into the
picture. Hartranft is fast, well-built,
and willing, but he has yet to learn the:
A. B. C.'s of playing the end position.
Kerr drafted him from the third eleven
after Janssen's injury, and set to work
to teach him the tricks of the trade.
Charlie Johnson, the tackle, is the
only other man under the wing of
Trainer Wallacc Denny. His wrenched
knee will keep him out of the game for
a week, and it is better than a ten to one
shot that he won't play against the
'"nites.
Jim Lawson may prove to be the
man of the hour in Kerr's end problem.
A special brace has been made for his
knee and he shows little effect of tin:
injury he suffered two weeks ago. It
is likely, however, that the coaches will
save him for the more important games.
Kerr added Joe Douglas to the first
string backfield for a time last night,
which seems to indicate that the hefty
line-plunger is about in condition to
take his regular turn.
Line Coach Thornhill continued
drilling the centers, < tackles, and
guards last night. After an hour of
rudimentary work, Kerr gave the grays
the high sign to come over. The var
sity was given the ball, and the backs
tore through the grays on delayed
bucks and criss-crossed plays for ten
and fifteen yards.
"Bud" Woodward was in at quarter
again and looked good. He knows his
game when it comes to running inter
ference, and threw some accurate
passes, which were caught by Wilcox
and Doughty.

shot that he won't play against the
'"nites.
Jim Lawson may prove to be the
man of the hour in Kerr's end problem.
A special brace has been made for his
knee and he shows little effect of tin:
injury he suffered two weeks ago. It
is likely, however, that the coaches will
save him for the more important games.
Kerr added Joe Douglas to the first
string backfield for a time last night,
which seems to indicate that the hefty
line-plunger is about in condition to
take his regular turn.
Line Coach Thornhill continued
drilling the centers, < tackles, and
guards last night. After an hour of
rudimentary work, Kerr gave the grays
the high sign to come over. The var
sity was given the ball, and the backs
tore through the grays on delayed
bucks and criss-crossed plays for ten
and fifteen yards.
"Bud" Woodward was in at quarter
again and looked good. He knows his
game when it comes to running inter
ference, and threw some accurate
passes, which were caught by Wilcox
and Doughty.

Bob Janssen, the tall end on the var
sity, won't be able to draw on a cleated
shoe for somf weeks to come. Janssen's
ankle was badly sprained last night
when he was running down under a

a week, and it is better than a ten to one
shot that he won't play against the
'"nites.
