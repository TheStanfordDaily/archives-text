# BLEACHER RALLY
## 
### 
It has been announced in the news columns of
the Daily Palo Alto and was mentioned in the
student assembly this morning that there is to be a
bleacher rally in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon at
3:30. It is the duty of every man who believes in
organized cheering to take part in these practices..
The singing in the Stadium last Saturday sounded
like the agonized wails of a dying menagerie. Song
had better be omitted in all student gatherings if it
is to carry the recent melancholy note. If warbling
is to be preserved, it is up to those who are interested
to show up tomorrow.
