# LATE DAILY DISTRIBUTION
## 
### 
\
Because of difficulties in the composing room of
the University Press, the Daily has been distributed
later than usual on the campus. Every effort is
being made to relieve the lalx>r situation. It is
thought that within a week conditions will resume
their normal aspect, after which the Daily will be
able to return to its regular service.
Announcements, notices, and space reservations
may not be handled properly at the present time, but
this situation, also, is due to'the labor troubles. The
readers of the Daily are asked to cooperate as much
as possible with the editorial staff and to bear with
patience such petty annoyances as cannot be avoided
at present.
