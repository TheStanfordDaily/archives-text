How to load a non-refillable pencil (that is, if you
have one; if not, directions can be used or trunks,
gum machines, punch, etc.):
Seize the pencil by the nozzle, gently but firmly; pull
eraser off other end; don't be afraid, pull it off with a
flourish, thus scattering' leads all over floor; then get
everybody in your row to help pick them up—they will
be glad to do it. A pleasant and profitable half hour
may be spent matching pennies on the floor with the
guy in the seat next to you.
When collected, jam leads into breach, followed by
suitable wadding, then ram them home with vigorous
blows on chair arm. If your chair has no arm, use
your neighbor's.
When pretty badly loaded, shake pencil vigorously,
then hold to the ear to see if it ticks; if it does, throw
it at the nearest polar bear and borrow your neighbor's
fountain pen.

A B OR NO B—IT DEPENDS ON THE QUESTION.
(Marlowe had a mighty line, but this is worse).
Act I, scene I, strike I. Usual time, usual place.
Egg: Who knows about the mountaineers?
Yegg: Let's skip the question, it takes years.
Keg: I know the answer! (Cheers).
Listen:
The mountaineer* they have long ears.
they live in caves and ditches;
They throw their clocks instead of rocks—
They scorn all filthy riches
Yegg (patronizingly): Wrong, as usual; listen, dears:
The mountaineers, they have long ears,
they do not care for trifles;
They hang their walls with cat-nip balls,
and shoot the cats with rifles.
Egg: Ab-h! !
Keg: Ah.
(All write).
Yegg (finished): Ah, dear friends, I hate to grieve you,
but I have finished, I must leave you
and depart.
Rest (pens dry): Sure, let's start.
(All tear out).
Next Act. Egg, Yegg, and Keg seated in back room.
Egg: That was sure an unfair test,
No wonder I can't do my best;
I could pass, like I always do,
If he asked me what I knew.
Chorus: These correctors are the hay!
They don't know nothin', anyway.
(All pay Ben).

ANYWAY, IT WON'T BE SO EASY TO STACK THE

This course in clay modeling sounds like the makings

How to load a non-refillable pencil (that is, if you
have one; if not, directions can be used or trunks,
gum machines, punch, etc.):
Seize the pencil by the nozzle, gently but firmly; pull
eraser off other end; don't be afraid, pull it off with a
flourish, thus scattering' leads all over floor; then get
everybody in your row to help pick them up—they will
be glad to do it. A pleasant and profitable half hour
may be spent matching pennies on the floor with the
guy in the seat next to you.
When collected, jam leads into breach, followed by
suitable wadding, then ram them home with vigorous
blows on chair arm. If your chair has no arm, use
your neighbor's.
When pretty badly loaded, shake pencil vigorously,
then hold to the ear to see if it ticks; if it does, throw
it at the nearest polar bear and borrow your neighbor's
fountain pen.

A B OR NO B—IT DEPENDS ON THE QUESTION.
(Marlowe had a mighty line, but this is worse).
Act I, scene I, strike I. Usual time, usual place.
Egg: Who knows about the mountaineers?
Yegg: Let's skip the question, it takes years.
Keg: I know the answer! (Cheers).
Listen:
The mountaineer* they have long ears.
they live in caves and ditches;
They throw their clocks instead of rocks—
They scorn all filthy riches
Yegg (patronizingly): Wrong, as usual; listen, dears:
The mountaineers, they have long ears,
they do not care for trifles;
They hang their walls with cat-nip balls,
and shoot the cats with rifles.
Egg: Ab-h! !
Keg: Ah.
(All write).
Yegg (finished): Ah, dear friends, I hate to grieve you,
but I have finished, I must leave you
and depart.
Rest (pens dry): Sure, let's start.
(All tear out).
Next Act. Egg, Yegg, and Keg seated in back room.
Egg: That was sure an unfair test,
No wonder I can't do my best;
I could pass, like I always do,
If he asked me what I knew.
Chorus: These correctors are the hay!
They don't know nothin', anyway.
