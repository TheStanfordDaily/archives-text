Correcting a general impression
work in the Military Department and
among students that they cannot take
the Physical Department both and get
credit, Major Leroy P. Collins, head of
the Military Department, states that if
a man takes both a physical course
and the field artillery course, he may
work off his requirements with the
former and get grade point credits for
the latter.
In speaking of the co-relation be
tween the two branches of work, Dr.
Barrow, Director of Physical Educa
tion, says: "If a man can arrange to
take the course (field artillery) and
in addition, enroll in physical training
work, whether it be in swimming, or
tennis, or football, or some other act
ivity, I feel that he will have achieved
an ideal combination. Therefore, if
any man has failed to enroll in Mili
tary Training because he has felt that
such an enrollment would interfere
with his entry into regular forms of
sports, I would urge him to consult
Major Collins or myself."
