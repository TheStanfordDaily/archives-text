### 
Latham True, acting University .or
ganist, will begin regular organ re
citals on Thursday afternoon at 4:15
He will play every Tuesday and Thurs
day at the same time and on Sunday
afternoons at 4 o'clock.
The program for Thursday is as
follows:
SEA PIECES, Op. 55-
....Edward Alexander MacDowell
To the Sea
"Ocean, though mighty monster"
Starlight
"The stars are but the cherubs
That sing about the throne
Of gray old Ocean's spouse,
Fair Moon's pale majesty."
Nautilus
"A fairy sail and a fairy boat"
A. D. MDCXX
"The yellow setting sun
Melts the lazy sea to gold
And gilds the swaying gaheon
That towards a land of promise
Lunges hugely on."
FANTASIA AND FUGUE
S. Archer Gibson
(Mr. Gibson, a New York organist, has
written a fugue that holds the in
terest of the listener).
AU SOIR Charles M. Widor
(A nocturne by the famous French
composer of organ music).
Mr. True says that his programs for
the next six weeks will be composed
of music that is thoroughly good but
not so technically intricate that it is
bbyond the grasp of those who are not
educated in music. His plan is to find
out whether or not the students will
appreciate and come more often to
listen to simple music that they can
understand than compositions that
frequently only the organist himself
is educated enough to comprehend, as
is often the case in musical .recitals.
