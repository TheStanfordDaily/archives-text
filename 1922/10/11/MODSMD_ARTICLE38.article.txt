# "Aristocracy of Brains" Advocated by Dartmouth
## 
### 
"Too many students not well enough
equipped mentally are admitted to col
lege work," is the declaration made by
President Hopkins of Dartmouth Col
lege. On this ground, he favors a
stricter selective process of college ma
triculations in the hope that the "mental
ly deficient" may be barred from such
institutions.
The stand taken by the Dartmuoth
president is indorsed by a number of
Eastern professors, among them Dean
Hawkes of Columbia. President Sill of
Bowdoin College says that institution has
always believed in the limitation of
students, but admits it is difficult to lay
down rules that deal adequately with
admissions. President Wilbur, in the
West, advocates the development of the
junior college system which will act as
a clearing house for the universities.
Exception to the attitude of President
Hopkins is taken by the New York In
stitute officials who are maintaining
that instead of there being too many
men flocking to college, altogether too
few can get near enough to college to
regret their financial inability to attend.
William H. Allen of the Institute cites
the fact that Dartmouth requires every
freshman to take two courses—Citizen
ship and Evolution—which he says are
just as necessary for the democracy of
brains as for the aristocracy of brains.
He declares further that it is hard to
see how Dartmouth can urge an aristoc
racy of brains when society's need is
not so much for a high quality of brains
as for a high quality of character and
capacity to use whatever of brains one
possesses. "The disease." he says, "lies
inside college management and not in
Young America."
