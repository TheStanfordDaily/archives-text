# PAJAMA-CLAD ENCINA MEN SHOCK CAMPUS WITH EERIE ATTIRE
## 
### 
Led by Knox Miller, '25, the Encina
Pajamarinors treated the campus to a real
torch-light Pee-rade last evening. All
living groups were forced to give up their
momentary pastimes and crowd to the
windows when the noisy file went by or
came in at double-time.
At 7 :30 Encina's select 400 were gath
ered 011 the front steps of the hall blink
ing their eyes after the glare of the
flash-light camera. Then the fun began.
In single file they paraded over to Roble
in the red light of the flares. After
circling Roble and straining their lungs
with yelling, Miller's cohorts serpentined
up the Row via all the Sorority porches
to the Phi Gamma Delta house. Here
the column turned and came back down
Salvatierra to the Delta Upsilon house
where, according to tradition, they were
served with apples.
The 400 white-clad noise-maker* then
paraded into the court of the New Union
where they-formed a double circle and
held a minature bleacher rally led bv
assistant yell-leader Burton Lapp, '24.
After this demonstration the hoarse
voiced congregation disbanded to return
to the quiet of the hall.
-Knox Miller wishes to thank the mem
bers of Delta Upsilon in behalf of Encina
Club for upholding a tradition as time
honored as the Pajamarino itself.
