# DEBATING DEVELOPS THOUGHT SAYS COACH
## 
### 
"Debating is more productive of
thought than anything else," declared
Debating Coach J. G. Emerson at a
meeting of-Euphronia Debating Society
last evening in Room 12 of the Law
buildmg. "The primary purpose of col
lege is to teach students to think, and
the worth of debating lies in this fact
â€”it compels speakers to think while on
their feet."
The same idea was expressed by
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the Law
Department who was the second speak
er of the evening. "Public speaking
is invaluable because it can help in all
situations. Keep up your activity along
this line for it is good training."
"Be square with your opponents and
don't take advantage of them. This is
debating ethics and intellectual hon
esty," Professor Cathcart continued.
In discussing Stanford's prospects in
debating for the current year, Debate
Coach Emerson declared that she had
excellent chances to win, but her de
baters must go in for the activity and
the benefit to be derived rather than
merely for the spirit of victory.
A new combination consisting of de
bating teams from Stanford, Califor
nia, and the University of Southern
California, has been formed and keen
competition is promised, Emerson stat
ed. Stanford will meet U. S. C. here
on the same night that another team
will meet California in Berkeley.
In discussing debating prospects at
California and at I'. S. C., Emerson
said that they have been the best in
years. "California has secured for the
first debating coach in her history a
man who has worked with the coach
at the University of Wisconsin who
incidentally has earned for himself a
reputation of being one of the iinest
in the United States. In addition to an
entirely new organization, $1500 has
been appropriated for use in further
ing debating interests at that institu
tion.
"Southern California is especially
strong since they have two good coaches
and a number of enthusiastic students.
I have been told that the law students
there do more debating than law work."
U. S. C. has been trying for a number
of years to schedule a debate with
Stanford. This will be the first for
some time that the two colleges will
meet 011 the forensic platform.
Forensic activities for the year in
clude the public speaking contest, and
the Joffre and Tri-State debates to be
held during the spring quarter.
Two Euphronia members conducted
a humorous debate on the relative mer
its of the new cafeteria and Union as
eating places on the campus. Neither
side won.
