# VARSITY AND BABE ELEVENS SCRIMMAGE
## LOWELL, SAN JOSE SQUADS WILL MEET BABES IN OPENERS 
### 
Lowell high of San Francisco, which
dropped a 44-6 game to the California
freshnieh two weeks ago, will meet
Stanford's 1926 eleven Saturday.
The high school men depend on an
aerial game. A pass, from Anderson,
quarter, to Van Horn, half, scored the
only touchdown against the Cubs.
Passes to Van Horn and Rankin, full,
accounted for the twelve in their 12-13
defeat by Oakland Tech last week.
They have a strong fighting line, but
are weak on kicks.
The frosh have a pair of fast ends
and a backfiehl that can—and has —
broken up tricky forward pass plays.
In Solomon and Nevers they have two
good boosters. Solomon is especially
accurate on try-for goal. Also, the
freshmen have a line combining weight
and skill.
This is the situation for the after
noon game Saturday, which will give
first insight into the relative strengths
of the Bear and Card frosh.
Whatever the score, it will be pie
for the prophets.
Captain Cyrus DeLashmutt, 180-
pound center, is the most dangerous
man on the San Jose high school
eleven, which meets the freshman
third stringers in the morning. He is
a three years' veteran, having played
since the American game was intro
duced there.
This team heliMhe San Jose Teach
ers' college to a 6-6 tie last week-end.
San Jose really had the thing sewed
up, but a fumble and an eighty-yard
run in the last few moments cost them
their victory.
As the Babes' second line of de
fense is being changed constantly, no
idea of their strength can be given as
yet.
It's certain, though, that they will
have a lot more competition than Oak
land furnished. The prep line is ten
pounds heavier, averaging 170. The
majority of the men are veterans, with
Bert Fehren, right half, and the alter
nate quarters, Hernandez and Gleason,
as star line plungers.
"Skull practice" was given the whole
freshman squad last night by Coach
Hunt and his assistants.
