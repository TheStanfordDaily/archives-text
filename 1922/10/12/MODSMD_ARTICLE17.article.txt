# Lectures on Advertising To Be Given Before Club
## 
### 
Plans to conduct a series of lectures in
commercial advertising were discussed at
the first dinner-meeting of the Stanford
Advertising Club in the New Union last
night. Bi-weekly dinners were arranged
# at which advertising men will talk, Mr.
Edwin St. George of Roos Brothers be
ing the first speaker.
Opportunities in the advertising field
of campus publications, especially for
freshmen and sophomores were pointed
out. Men working their way through
the University have found this an occu
pation which is not only profitable but
practical. Business managers of the
respective publications will discuss the
work with any who are anxious to take it
up.
Donald McQueen, '25, was elected vice
president of the organization for the
ensuing quarter.
